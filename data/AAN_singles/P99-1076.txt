Parsing preferences with Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars :exploiting the derivation treeAlexandra KINYONTALANAUniversite Paris 7, case 7003,2pl Jussieu 75005 Paris FranceAlexandra.Kinyon@linguist.jussieu.frAbstractSince Kimball (73) parsing preferenceprinciples such as "Right association"(RA) and "Minimal attachment" (MA) areoften formulated with respect toconstituent trees.
We present 3 preferenceprinciples based on "derivation trees"within the framework of LTAGs.
Weargue they remedy some shortcomings ofthe former approaches and account forwidely accepted heuristics (e.g.argument/modifier, idioms...).IntroductionThe inherent characteristics of LTAGs (i.e.lexicalization, adjunction, an extended omain oflocality and "mildly-context sensitive" power)makes it attractive to Natural LanguageProcessing : LTAGs are parsable in polynomialtime and allow an elegant andpsycholinguistically plausible representation ofnatural language 1.
Large coverage grammarswere developed for English (Xtag group (95))and French (Abeille (91)).
Unfortunately, "large"grammars yield high ambiguity rates : Doran &al.
(94) report 7.46 parses / sentence on a WSJcorpus of 18730 sentences using a wide coverageEnglish grammar.
Srinivas & al.
(95) formulatedomain independent heuristics to rank parses.But this approach is practical, English-oriented,not explicitly linked to psycholinguistic results,and does not fully exploit "derivation"i e.g.
Frank (92) discusses the psycholinguisticrelevance of adjunction for Children LanguageAcquisition, Joshi (90) discusses psycholinguisticresults on crossed and serial dependencies.information.
In this paper, we present 3disambiguation principles which exploitderivation trees.1, Br ie f  presentation of LTAGsA LTAG consists of a finite set ofelementary trees of finite depth.
Eachelementary tree must <<anchor>> one or morelexical item(s).
The principal anchor is calleddaead>>, other anchors are called <<co-heads>>.
Allleaves in elementary trees are either <<anchor>>,<<foot node>> (noted *) or <<substitution node>>(noted $).
These trees are of 2 types ?
auxiliaryor initial 2.
A tree has at most 1 foot-node, such atree is an auxiliary tree.
Trees that are notauxiliary are initial.
Elementary trees combinewith 2 operations : substitution and adjunetion.Substitution is compulsory and is used essentiallyfor arguments (subject, verb and nouncomplements).
It consists in replacing in a tree(elementary or not) a node marked forsubstitution with an initial tree that has a root ofsame category.
Adjunction is optional (althoughit can be forbidden or made compulsory usingspecific constraints) and deals essentially withdeterminers, modifiers, auxiliaries, modals,raising verbs (e.g.
seem).
It consists in insertingin a tree in place of a node X an auxiliary treewith a root of same category.
The descendants ofX then become the descendants of the foot nodeof the auxiliary tree.
Contrary to context-freerewriting rules, the history of derivation must bemade explicit since the same derived tree can beobtained using different derivations.
This is whyparsing LTAGs yields a derivation tree, from2 Traditionally initial trees are called o~, andauxiliary trees 13585which a derived tree (i.e.
constituent tree) can beobtained.
(Figure 1) 3 .
Branches in a derivationtree are unordered.Moreover, linguistic constraints on the well-formedness of elementary trees have beenformulated :?
Predicate Argument Cooccurence Principle :there must be a leaf node for each realizedargument of the head of an elementary tree.?
Semantic onsistency : No elementary tree issemantically void?
Semantic minimality : an elementary treecorresponds at most o one semantic unit2.
Former results on parsing preferencesA vast literature addresses parsing preferences.Structural approaches introduced 2 principles :RA accounts for the preferred reading of theambiguous entence (a) : "yesterday" attaches to"left" and not to "said" (Kimball (73)).MA accounts for the preferred reading of (b) :"for Sue" attaches to "bought" and not to"flowers" (Frazier & Fodor (78))(a) Tom said that Joe left yesterday(b) Tom bought he flowers for SueThese structural principles have been criticizedthough : Among other things, the interactionbetween these principles is unclear.
This type ofapproach lacks provision for integration withsemantics and/or pragmatics (Schubert (84)),does not clearly establish the distinction betweenarguments and modifiers (Ferreira & Clifton(86)) and is English-biased : evidence against RAhas been found for Spanish (Cuetos & Mitchell(88)) and Dutch (Brysbaert & Mitchell (96)).Some parsing preferences are widely accepted,though:The idiomatic interpretation of a sentence isfavored over its literal interpretation (Gibbs &Nayak (89)).Arguments are preferred over modifiers (Abney(89), Britt & al.
(92)).Additionally, lexical factors (e.g.
frequency ofsubcategorization for a given verb) have beenshown to influence parsing preferences (I-Iindle &Rooth (93)).It is striking that these three most consensualtypes of syntactic preferences tum out to bedifficult to formalize by resorting only to"constituent trees" , but easy to formalize interms of LTAGs.Before explaining our approach, we mustunderline that the examples 4 presented later onare not necessarily counter-examples to RA andor MA, but just illustrations : our goal is not tofurther criticize RA and MA, but to show thatproblems linked to these "traditional" structuralapproaches do not automatically condemn allstructural approaches.3 Three  preference principles based onderivation treesFor sake of brevity, we will not develop theimportance of "lexical factors", but just note thatLTAGs are obviously well suited to representthat type of preferences because of stronglexicalization 5.To account for the "idiomatic" vs "literal", andfor the "argument" vs "modifier" preferences, weformulate three parsing preference principlesbased on the shape of derivation trees :1.
Prefer the derivation tree with the fewernumber of nodes2.
Prefer to attach an m-tree low 63.
Prefer the derivation tree with the fewernumber of 13-tree nodesPrinciple 1 takes precedence over principle 2 andprinciple 2 takes precedence over principle 3.3 Our examples follow linguistic analyses presentedin (Abeill6 (91)), except hat we substitute sententialcomplements when no extraction occurs.
Thus weuse no VP node and no Wh nor NP traces.
But thishas no incidence on the application of our preferenceprinciples.4 These examples are kept simple on purpose, forsake of clarity.Also, "lexical preferences" and "structuralpreferences" are not necessarily antagonistic and canboth be used for practical purpose.6 By low we mean "as far as possible from the root".5863.1 What  these principles account  forPrinciple 1 accounts for the preference"idiomatic" over "literal": In LTAGs, all the setelements of an idiomatic expression are present ma single elementary tree.
Figure 1 shows the 2derivation trees obtained when parsing"Yesterday John kicked the bucket".

idiomatic interpretation) hasfewer nodes.lSf_yesterday (z_John (z.bucket 13.the ~ '~X\S N N NAdv S* John Bucket Det N*I IYesterday The(z-kicked-the-bucket (z-kickedS Skicked kicked Det NI Ithe buckelElementary trees for \["Yesterday John kicked the bucket" \] //or-kicked-the-bucket (z-kicked(z-John \[3-yesterday (z-John (z-bucket \[3-yesterdayI~ -the~referred erivation tree I IDispreferred erivation tree \[$Adv SYesterday N V NJohn kicked Det NI Ithe bucket\[ Both derivation trees yield the same derived tree \[FIGURE 17Illustration of Principle 17 In derivation trees, plain lines indicate an ,adjunction, dotted lines a substitution.~N n \[3-the ~xl-Organizer ct-Demonstrafi~m N N NI / /John Det N* Organizer DemonstrationITheel-suspects c~2-OrganizerS NN04, V N I4 ,  Organizer PPSuspects o~2-suspects P~ep NI4,ofSN04, V NI4, PPSuspects ~ep ~d~1 Elementary t ees for II " J?hn 'he ?I *="*"?""

We keptthe1074 grammatical ones (i.e.
noted "1" in theTSNLP terminology) ofcategory S or augmentedto S (excluding coordination ) that were accepted.A human picked one or more "correct"derivations for each sentence parsed 8.Principle 1,and then Principles 1 & 2 were applied on thederivation trees to eliminate some derivations.Table 1 shows the results obtained.Total #'ofBeforeapplyingprinciples1074A.~erapplyingprinciplel1074A~erapplyingprinciplesl&21074sentencesTotal #of  3057 2474 2334derivations1070(99.6 %)537537n.a.2.85#ofsentenceswith atleast 1correctparse#ofambiguoussentences# of nonambiguoussentences1055(98.2 %)4276478923# ofpartiallydisambiguatedsentences# of parses/ sentenceTABLE 1 : results for TSNLP1054(98.1%)424650862.i74.1 Comments on the resultsARer disambiguating with principles 1 and 2, theproportion of sentences with at least one parsejudged correct by a human only marginallydecreased while the average number of parses pers More than one derivation was deemed "correct"when non spurious ambiguity remained in modifierattachment (e.g.
He saw the man with a telescope)sentence went down from 2.85 to 2.17 (i.e.
-24%).Since "strict modifier attachment" is orthogonalto our concem, a sentence such as (f) still yields5 derivations, partly because of spuriousambiguity, partly because of adverbialattachment (i.e.
'qaier" attached to S or to V).1l a travailld hier (He worked yesterday)Therefore most sentences aren~ disambiguated byprinciples 1 or 2, especially those anchoring anintransitive verb.
For sentences that are affectedby at least one of these two principles, theaverage number of parses per sentence goesdown from 6.76 to 2.94 after applying bothprinciples (i.e.
- 56.5 %).

Forinstance it systematically favored the attachmentof "by" phrases as passive with agent,Principle 2 favored lower attachment ofarguments as in (g) but proved useful only inconjunction with Principle 1 : it provided furtherdisambiguation by selecting derivation treesamong those with an equally low number ofnodes.588Principle 2 says to attach an argument low (e.g.to the direct object of the mare verb) rather thanhigh (e.g.
to the verb).
In (el), "of thedemonstration" attaches to "organizer" ratherthan to "suspect", while m (c2) "of the crime" canonly attach to the verb.
Figure 2 shows howprinciple 2 yields the preferred erivation tree forsentence (cl).
Similarly, in sentence (dl) "towhom" attaches to "say" rather than to "give",while in (d2) it attaches to "give" since "think"can not take a PP complement.
This agrees withpsycholinguistic results such as "filled gapeffects" (Cram & Fodor (85)).
(cl) John suspects the organizer of thedemonstration(c2) John suspects Bill of the crime(dl) To whom does Mary say that Johngives flowers.
(d2) To whom does Mary think that Johngives flowers.Principle 3 prefers arguments over modifiers.Figure 3 shows that principle 3 predicts thepreferred erivation tree for (e) : "to be honest"argument of "prefer", ruling out 'to be honest" assentence modifier (i.e.
"To be honest, he prefershis daughter").
(e) John prefers his daughter to be honest.These three principles aim at attaching argumentsas accurately as possible and do not deal with"strict" modifier attachment for the followingreasons :?
There is a lack of agreement concerning thevalidity of preferences principles for"modifier attachment"?
Principle 3, which deals the most withmodifier attachment, turned out the leastconclusive when confronted toempirical data?
We wanted to evaluate how attachingarguments correctly affects ambiguity, allother factors remaining unchanged.4 Some resultsFrench sentences from the test suite developed inthe TSNLP project (Estival & Lehman (96))were originally parsed using Xtag with a domainindependent wide-coverage rammar/- a-John a-daughterN NI IJohn daughteral-Prefer~-his a-honestN AdjDet N* HonestIa2-PreferS SI IP~ff~ P~~z-Be I~-BeVinf Si rep Vinf' S* P~p Vinf'to V Adj~ to "~I IBe BeElementary trees I'Johnprefers his daughter tobe honest" \ ] /I !

).Therefore we have postponed testing it untilfurther efinement is found.5 ConclusionWe have presented three application-independent,domain-independent and language-independentdisambiguation principles formulated in terms ofderivation trees within the framework of LTAGs.But since they are straightforward to implement,these principles can be used for parse rankingapplications or integrated into a parser to reducenon determinism.
Preliminary results areencouraging asto the soundness of at least wo ofthese principles.
Further work will focus ontesting these principles on larger corpora (e.g.
LeMonde) as well as on other languages, refiningthem for practical purposes (e.g.
addition offrequency information and principles formodifiers attachment).
Since it is the first time toour knowledge that parsing preferences areformulated in terms of derivation trees, it wouldalso be interesting to see how this could beadapted to dependency-based parsing.ReferencesAbeill6 /L (1991) Une grammaire lexicalisded'arbres adjoints pour le franfais.
