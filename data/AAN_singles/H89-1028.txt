NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST)(Formerly National Bureau of Standards)Principal Investigator: David S. PallettOur objectives in the DARPA Spoken Language Program are: (1) to provide a central role inspeech database design, development and distribution; and (2) to design, coordinateimplementation f, and analyze results of performance t sts.Recent Accomplishments:(1) Developed a uniform scoring procedure and C-language software for Benchmark Testsusing the DARPA Resource Management Speech Database.
(2) Coordinated and provided test material for the DARPA Speech Recognition BenchmarkTests in March and October '87, June '88, and February '89.
Early tests involved BBN,CMU, MIT/Lincoln Labs and SRI.
The February '89 tests are also expected to includeMIT/Zue and AT&T Bell Laboratories.
(3) Prepared the Prototype CD-ROM Version of the DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-PhoneticSpeech Database.
This CD-ROM contains the data for 420 talkers (4200 sentenceutterances and accompanying orthographic and phonetically-based transcriptions), andrepresents he first use of CD-ROM technology for storage and transfer of speech databasesin the United States.
(4) Formed a Spoken Language Systems Performance Evaluation Working Group whos firsttask is to adapt benchmark test procedures for spontaneous goal-directed speech.Plans for the remainder of FY 1989:(1) Analyze the results of recent DARPA Benchmark Tests and provide a summary report.
(2) Prepare a report documenting the recommendations of the Spoken Language SystemsPerformance Evaluation Working Group and analysis of performance measures proposed, todate, in the DARPA "Performance Tasks".
(3) Assume increased responsibility for coordination and public distribution of theDARPA-community's speech databases.
(4) Prepare a CD-ROM version of the complete (630 speaker) DARPA TIMITAcoustic-Phonetic Database, reflecting changes in format and corrections made availableafter release of the Prototype CD-ROM version.191
