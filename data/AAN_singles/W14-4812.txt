Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Computational Terminology, pages 94?103,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Unsupervised method for the acquisition of general language paraphrasesfor medical compoundsNatalia GrabarCNRS UMR 8163 STLUniversit?e Lille 359653 Villeneuve d?Ascq, Francenatalia.grabar@univ-lille3.frThierry HamonLIMSI-CNRS, BP133, OrsayUniversit?e Paris 13Sorbonne Paris Cit?e, Francehamon@limsi.frAbstractMedical information is widespread in modern society (e.g.
scientific research, medical blogs,clinical documents, TV and radio broadcast, novels).
Moreover, everybody?s life may be con-cerned with medical problems.
However, the medical field conveys very specific and oftenopaque notions (e.g., myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, abdominal strangulated hernia,galactose urine), that are difficult to understand by lay people.
We propose an automatic methodbased on the morphological analysis of terms and on text mining for finding the paraphrases oftechnical terms.
Analysis of the results and their evaluation indicate that we can find correctparaphrases for 343 terms.
Depending on the semantics of the terms, error rate of the extractionsranges between 0 and 59%.
This kind of resources is useful for several Natural Language Pro-cessing applications (i.e., information extraction, text simplification, question and answering).1 BackgroundMedical and health information is widespread in the modern society in light of pressing health concernsand of maintaining of healthy lifestyles.
Besides, it is also available through modern media: scientificresearch, articles, medical blogs and fora, clinical documents, TV and radio broadcast, novels, discussionfora, epidemiological alerts, etc.
Still, availability of medical and health information does not guaran-tee its easy and correct understanding by lay people.
The medical field conveys indeed very technicalnotions, such as in example (1).
(1) myocardial infarction, cholecystectomy, erythredema polyneuropathy, acromegaly, galactosemiaAlthough technical, these notions are nevertheless important for patients (AMA, 1999; McCray, 2005;Eysenbach, 2007; Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center, 2008).
It has been shown that in severalsituations such notions cannot be correctly understood by patients: the steps needed for the medicationpreparing and use (Patel et al., 2002); the instructions on drugs from patient package inserts, and theinformation delivered in informed consensus and health brochures: it appears that among the 2,600patients recruited in two hospitals, 26% to 60% cannot manage information available in these sources(Williams et al., 1995); health information in different languages (English, Spanish, French) provided inwebsites created for patients require high reading level (Berland et al., 2001; Hargrave et al., 2003; Kusec,2004) and remains difficult to manage by patients, which can be negative for the communication betweenpatients and medical professionals, and the healthcare process (Tran et al., 2009).
This situation sets thecontext of our work.
Our objective is to propose method for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases fortechnical medical notions.
More particularly, we propose to concentrate on terms and their words thatshow neoclassical compounding word formation (Booij, 2010; Iacobini, 1997; Amiot and Dal, 2005),such as in the example (1).
Such words often involve Latin and Greek roots or bases, which makes themmore difficult to understand, as such words must be decomposed first (see examples (2) and (3)).
To ourknowledge, this kind of approach has not been applied for the acquisition of laymen paraphrases.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Readability.
The readability studies the ease in which text can be understood.
Two kinds of readabil-ity measures are distinguished: classical and computational (Franc?ois, 2011).
Classical measuresare usually based on number of characters and/or syllables in words, sentences or documents and onlinear regression models (Flesch, 1948; Gunning, 1973; Dubay, 2004).
Computational measures,that are more recent, can involve vectorial models and a great variety of descriptors.
These de-scriptors, usually specific to the texts processed, are for instance: combination of classical measureswith medical terminologies (Kokkinakis and Toporowska Gronostaj, 2006); n-grams of characters(Poprat et al., 2006); discursive descriptors (Goeuriot et al., 2007); lexicon (Miller et al., 2007);morphological descriptors (Chmielik and Grabar, 2011); combination of various descriptors (Wang,2006; Zeng-Treiler et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008; Franc?ois and Fairon, 2013).?
Lexical simplification.
The lexical simplification helps to make text easier to understand.
Lexicalsimplification of texts in English has been addressed during the SemEval 2012 challengea.
Givena short input text and a target word in English, and given several English substitutes for the tar-get word that fit the context, the goal was to rank these substitutes according to how simple theyare (Specia et al., 2012).
Several clues have been applied: lexicon extracted from oral corpus andWikipedia, Google n-grams, WordNet (Sinha, 2012); word length, number of syllables, mutual in-formation and frequency of words (Jauhar and Specia, 2012); frequency in Wikipedia, word length,n-grams of characters and of words, syntactic complexity of documents (Johannsen et al., 2012);n-grams, frequency in Wikipedia, n-Google grams (Ligozat et al., 2012); WordNet and word fre-quency (Amoia and Romanelli, 2012).?
Dedicated resources.
The building of resources suitable for performing the simplification is an-other related research topics.
Such resources are mainly two-fold lexica in which specialized andnon-specialized vocabularies are aligned (in examples (4) to (6), the technical terms are followedby their non-technical equivalents).
The first initiative of the kind appeared with the collaborativeeffort Consumer Health Vocabulary (Zeng and Tse, 2006) (examples in (4)).
One of the meth-ods was applied to the most frequently occurring medical queries aligned to the UMLS (UnifiedMedical Language System) concepts (Lindberg et al., 1993).
Another work exploited a small cor-pus and several statistical association measures for building aligned lexicon with technical termsfrom the UMLS and their lay equivalents (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007).
Similar work in other lan-guages followed.
In French, researchers proposed methods for the acquisition of syntactic variation(Del?eger and Zweigenbaum, 2008; Cartoni and Del?eger, 2011) from comparable specialized andnon-specialized corpora, that led to the detection of verb/noun variations (examples in (5)) and alarger set of syntactic variations (examples in (6)).
Besides, research on the acquisition of termi-nological variation (Hahn et al., 2001), synonymy (Fern?andez-Silva et al., 2011) and paraphrasing(Max et al., 2012) is also relevant to outline the topics.
(4) {myocardial infarction, heart attack}, {abortion, termination of pregnancy}, {acrodynia, pinkdisease}(5) {consommation r?eguli`ere, consommer de fac?on r?eguli`ere} (regular use), {g?ene `a la lecture,emp?eche de lire} (reading difficulty), {?evolution de l?affection, la maladie ?evolue} (evolution of thecondition)(6) {retard de cicatrisation, retarder la cicatrisation} (delay the healing), {apports caloriques, apporten calories} (calorie supply), {calculer les doses, doses sont calcul?ees} (calculate the dose), {efficacit?eest renforc?ee, renforcer son efficacit?e} (improve the efficiency)ahttp://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/95Our work is closely related to the building of resources dedicated to the lexical simplification.
Ourobjective is to propose method for paraphrasing the technical medical terms (i.e.
medical compounds) inexpressions that are easier to understand by lay people.
This aspect is seldom addressed: we can observethat only some examples in (4) are concerned with the paraphrasing of technical and compound terms(myocardial infarction, acrodynia).
We work with the French data.
Contrary to previous work, we donot use comparable corpora with technical and non-technical texts.
Instead, we exploit terms from anexisting medical terminology and corpora built from social media sources.
We assume that this kindof corpora may provide lay people equivalents for technical terms.
We also rely on the morphologicalanalysis of technical terms.
The expected result is to obtain pairs like {myocardial, heart muscle} or{cholecystectomy, removal of gall bladder}.
In the following, we start with the presentation of theresources used (section 2), we present then the steps of the methodology (section 3).
We describe anddiscuss the obtained results (section 4) and conclude with some directions for future work (section 5).2 Resources2.1 Medical termsThe material processed is issued from the French part of the UMLS.
It provides syntactically simple termsthat contain one word only (acrodynia), and syntactically complex terms that contain more than one word(myocardial infarction).
Syntactically complex terms are segmented in words.
Each term is associatedto semantic types.
When a given word receives more than one semantic type, a manual post-processingallows to disambiguate it: each word is assigned to one semantic type only.
Among the semantic typesavailable, we consider the three most common in the medical practice to which the lay people are themost exposed: Anatomy (616 words): describe human body anatomy (e.g.
abdominopelvic); Disorders(2,283 words): describe medical problems and their signs (e.g.
infarction, diabetes); Procedures (1,271words): describe procedures which may be performed by medical staff to detect or cure disorders (e.g.cholecystectomy).
In what follows, word and term can be exchangeable and mean either the graphicalunit provided by the segmentation, or the medical notion.2.2 CorporaWiki LesDiab DiabDoct HT DosNumber of pages/threads 17,525 6,939 387,435 67,652 8,319Number of articles/messages 17,525 1,438 22,431 12,588 1,124Number of words 4,326,880 624,571 35,059,868 6,788,361 836,520Table 1: Size of the corpora exploited.We use several corpora collected from the social media sources (their sizes are indicated in Table 1):1.
Wiki contains French Wikipedia articles downloaded in February 2014, of which we keep those thatare categorized under the medical category Portail de la m?edecine;2.

Thanksto the collaborative writing of the articles, these contain mostly correct information about the topicsconcerned.
Other corpora are collected from the dedicated fora (e.g.
diabetes or backache).
We assumethat people involved in these discussions may show low, middle or high degree of knowledge about thedisorders and related notions.
We expect that all our corpora are written in a simple style and that theycontain paraphrases of technical terms.
From Table 1, we can observe that the corpora vary in size.3 Methodology for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases for medical compoundsThe methodology is designed for analyzing the neoclassical medical compounds and for searching theirnon-technical paraphrases in corpora.
In our approach, the paraphrases may occur alone, such as heartmuscle, without being accompanied by their technical compounds (myocarde).
In this case, we need firstto acquire the knowledge needed for their automatic detection.
We propose to rely on the morphologicalanalysis of terms.
The method is composed of four main steps: the processing of terms, the processing ofcorpora, the extraction of layman paraphrases for technical terms, and the evaluation of the extractions.3.1 The processing of medical termsTo reach the morphological information on terms we apply three specific processing:1.
Morpho-syntactic tagging and lemmatization of terms.
The terms are morpho-syntactically taggedand lemmatized with TreeTagger for French (Schmid, 1994).
The morpho-syntactic tagging isdone in context of the terms.
If a given word receives more than one tag, the most frequent one iskept.
At this step, we obtain term lemmas with their part-of-speech tags, such as in example (7).
(7) myocardique/A (myocardial/A), chol?ecystectomie/N (cholecystectomy/N), polyneuropathie/N(polyneuropathy/N), acrom?egalie/N (acromegaly/N), galactos?emie/N (galactosemia/N)2.
Morphological analysis.
The lemmas are then morphologically analyzed with D?eriF (Namer,2009).
This tool performs the analysis of lemmas in order to detect their morphological structure,to decompose them into their components (bases and affixes), and to semantically analyze theirstructure.
We give some examples of the morphological analysis in (8).
(8) myocardique/A: [[[myo N*] [carde N*] NOM] ique ADJ]chol?ecystectomie/N: [[chol?ecysto N*] [ectomie N*] NOM]polyneuropathie/N: [poly [[neur N*] [pathie N*] NOM] NOM]acrom?egalie/N: [[acr N*] [m?egal N*] ie NOM]galactos?emie/N: [[galactose NOM] [?em N*] ie NOM]The computed bases and affixes are associated with syntactic categories (NOM, ADJ, V).
When agiven base is suppletive (does not exist in modern French but was borrowed from Latin or Greeklanguages), D?eriF assigns the most probable category (e.g.
N* for nouns, A* for adjectives).
Forinstance, the analysis of myocardique/A indicates that this word contains the suppletive noun basesmyo N* (muscle) and carde N* (heart), and the affix -ique/ADJ.
We can observe that some bases canbe decomposed further (e.g.
galactose in galact (milk) and ose (sugars), cholecystectomy in chole (bile)and cystis (bladder)).
The words that contain more than one base are considered to be compoundsand are processed in the further steps of the method.3.
Association of morphological components with French words.
The bases are ?translated?
with wordsfrom modern French.
We use for this resource built in previous work (Zweigenbaum and Grabar,2003; Namer, 2003) (see some examples in (9)).
(9) myocardique/A: myo=muscle (muscle), carde=coeur (heart)chol?ecystectomie/N: chol?ecysto=v?esicule biliaire (gall bladder), ectomie=ablation (removal)97polyneuropathie/N: poly=nombreux (several), neuro=nerf (nerve), pathie=maladie (disorder)acrom?egalie/N: acr=extr?emit?e (extremity), m?egal=grandeur (size)galactos?emie/N: galactose=galactose (galactose), ?em=sang (blood)Some words can remain technical (e.g., galactose, v?esicule biliaire), while other components totallylose their technical meaning (e.g.
m?egal=grandeur (size), poly=nombreux (several)).3.2 The processing of corporaThe corpora are first segmented in words and sentences.
Then, we also perform morpho-syntactic taggingand lemmatization with TreeTagger for French.3.3 The extraction of layman paraphrases corresponding to technical termsFrench words corresponding to the morphological decomposition of terms (examples in (9)) are projectedon corpora in order to extract sentences and their segments which can provide the layman paraphrases forthe corresponding technical terms.
Sentences that contain the translated French words are extracted ascandidates for proposing the paraphrases.
Additionally, the segments delimited by these words are alsoextracted.
We consider the co-occurrence of the words issued from the morphological decomposition ina sliding graphical window of n words.
In the experiments presented, the window size n is fixed to 10words.
Smaller or larger windows show less performance.
(10) Les causes de tachycardie ventriculaire sont superposables `a celles des extrasystoles ventric-ulaires: infarctus du myocarde, insuffisance cardiaque, hypertrophie du muscle du coeur etprolapsus de la valve mitrale.The sentence in (10) contains words muscle and coeur, underlined in the example, that correspond tothe morphological components of myocardique (see examples in (9)).
For this reason, this sentence isextracted, as well as the segment delimited by these two words muscle du coeur (heart muscle).3.4 The evaluationThe objective of the evaluation is to assess whether the proposed method is valid for the acquisitionof paraphrases for technical medical terms.
The obtained results are evaluated manually by a com-puter scientist with no training in biomedicine, but with background in computational linguistics andmorphology.
We analyze the candidates for paraphrases from several points of view: Are the Frenchwords corresponding to the components extracted correctly?
Do these French words provide valid can-didates for paraphrases?
How easy are these paraphrases to be understood by laymen or by non-expertsin medicine?
During the evaluation related to the second point (Do these French words provide validcandidates for paraphrases?
), we distinguish four situations:1. the extraction is correct: e.g.
myocardique paraphrased in muscle du coeur (heart muscle);2. the extraction suffers from the incorrect morphological decomposition or from the wrong ?trans-lation?
in French: e.g.
p?erianal is ?translated?
in autour (around) and an (meaning year as it is).
The?translation?
of this last word an is not correct and should be anus (anus) instead.
Because of thewrong ?translation?, we collect a lot of incorrect segments like autour de 30 ans (around 30 years);3. the extraction should be post-processed but contains the correct paraphrase: e.g.
spondylarthrose,?translated?
in vert`ebre (vertebra) and arthrose (arthrosis), is paraphrased in arthrose que l?on ne voyaitpas sur la vert`ebre (arthrosis that was not seen on the vertebra), while the correct paraphrase from thissegment should be arthrose sur la vert`ebre (arthrosis on the vertebra);4. the extraction is wrong and can provide no useful information.This evaluation allows to estimate precision of the results in three versions: strong precision Pstrong(onlythe correct extractions are considered (extractions from 1)); weak precision Pweak(correct extractionsand extractions that need post-processing are considered (extractions from 1 and 3)); rate of incorrectextractions %incorrect(the percentage of the incorrect extractions is computed (extractions from 4)).984 Results and Discussion4.1 The morphological analysis of termsWe generate the morphological analysis for 218 single words from the anatomy semantic type, 1,789 dis-order words and 1,023 procedure words: over 70% of words are morphologically analyzed.
Among thesewords, we observe compounds (myocardique) and words formed with affixes (e.g.
r?eadaptation derivedfrom adaptation, derived in its turn from adapter).
The remaining words may be simple (e.g.
abc`es(abscess), l`epre (leprosy), cicatrice (scar)) or contain bases and affixes that are not managed by D?erif (e.g.pneumostrongylose (pneumostrongylosis), lagophtalmie (lagophthalmos), n?ecatorose (necatorosis)).
Among thegenerated decompositions by D?erif, we can find some cases with ambiguous decomposition that occurwhen medical terms can be decomposed in several possible ways, among which only one is semanticallycorrect.
For instance, posturographie (posturography) is decomposed into: [post [[uro N*] [graphie N*]NOM] NOM], which may be glossed as control during the period which follows the therapy done onthe urinary system.
From the formal point of view, such decomposition is very possible, although it isweak semantically.
For the term posturographie, the right decomposition is: [[posturo N*] [graphieN*] NOM], which is related to the definition of the optimal body position when walking or sitting.
Asindicated above, some terms (e.g.
p?erianal) can be incorrectly ?translated?
in French.4.2 The preprocessing of corporaOur main difficulty at this step is related to the processing of forum messages and to their segmentationinto sentences.
In addition to possible and frequent spelling and grammatical errors, forum messageshave also a very specific punctuation, which may be missing or convey personal feelings and emotions.This seriously impedes the possibility to provide the correct segmentation in sentences, and means that,because of the missing punctuation, the mapping of decomposed terms with corpora may be done withbigger text segments in which the semantic relations between the mapped components may be weak ornon-existent, and provide incorrect extractions.
We plan to combine the current method with the syntacticanalysis in order to ensure that stronger syntactic and semantic relations exist between the components.4.3 The extraction of paraphrases and their evaluationWe present the results on extraction of sentences and paraphrases from the corpora processed.
In Table2, for the three semantic types of terms (anatomy ana., disorders dis., and procedures pro.)
from eachcorpus, we indicate the following information: the number of different sentences extracted (sentences),yje number of different terms (uniq.
terms), the number of correct paraphrases (correct), the numberof paraphrases that are possibly correct (pos.
correct), the number of paraphrases which morphologicalanalysis and ?translation?
should be improved (morph.
ana.
), and the number of incorrect paraphrases(incorrect).
The last three lines indicate the precision values: strong precision (Pstrong), weak precision(Pweak) and incorrect extractions (%incorrect).Number of Wiki LesDiab DiabDoct HT Dosana dis pro ana dis pro ana dis pro ana dis pro ana dis prosentences 1238 4003 999 15 71 10 721 2901 564 246 1233 678 42 708 30uniq.

Accordingto these observations, Pstrongranges between 20 to 46% for anatomy, 39 and 66% for disorders, and 6 to43 for procedures.
The Pweakvalues, that takes into account the paraphrases that need post-processing,show the increase by 0 to 28% by comparison with the Pstrongvalues.
The %incorrectvalues indicatethat anatomy terms show the largest rate (40 to 59%) of incorrect paraphrases: it is possible that theanatomy terms present the lowest rate of compositionality.
The incorrect paraphrases are between 20and 47 among the disorder terms, and between 0 to 54 among the procedure terms.
The syntactic anal-ysis may help to improve the current results.
On the whole, the proposed method allows to extract theparaphrases for 722 different terms from the corpora processed.
Within the evaluated set of extractions,these paraphrases are correct for 273 terms; while 343 terms are provided with correct paraphrases andparaphrases that need to be post-processed.
Most of the extracted paraphrases are noun phrases, and, ata lesser extent, verb phrases.
We present some examples of the correct paraphrases extracted:- dorsalgie (dorsalgia): douleur dans le dos (pain in the back)- my?elocyte (myelocyte): cellules dans la moelle osseuse (cells of the bone marrow)- lombalgie (lombalgia): douleurs dans les reins (pain in kidney)- gastralgie (gastralgia): douleurs `a l?estomac (stomach pain)- desmorrhexie (desmorrhexia): rupture des ligaments (ligamentous rupture)- h?epatite (hepatitis): inflammation du foie (liver inflammation)We can find several types of paraphrases that suffer from incorrect decomposition or ?translation?:?
syringomy?elie (syringomyelia) is currently ?translated?
in moelle (marrow or spinal cord) and canal (canal).This term means a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord.
We assume thata more correct ?translation?
of this term should be: moelle (marrow or spinal cord) and cavit?e (cavity);?
sous-dural is ?translated?
in sous (sub) and dur (hard).
The term is related to specific space in brainthat can be opened by the separation of the arachnoid mater from the dura mater.
Concerning its?translation?, we assume that dure-m`ere (dura mater) should be used instead of dur (hard).
Besides,the names of anatomical locations often remains difficult to understand.
We assume that even whenterms are decomposed and ?translated?
correctly, the paraphrases for such terms may be not suitablefor laymen: other types of explanations (e.g.
schemes or pictures) should be used instead;?
hyper?emie (hyperaemia) is ?translated?
in hyper and sang (blood).
The term means the increase ofblood flow to different tissues in the body.
This term is not fully compositional because the notionof tissues is absent, while necessary for its understanding.
The proposed extractions for this termmainly come from corpora related to diabetes, in which hyper and hypo are often used in relationwith the hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
This means that hyper should be ?translated?
with otherwords, such as increase or elevated;?
h?et?erotopie is translated in autre (another) and endroit (place).
The term means the displacement of anorgan from its normal position and that [an organ] is found in another place than the one expected.This term brings no correct candidates for paraphrases because: it is not fully compositional and its?translation?
provides very common words widely used in the corpora.Among the incorrect extractions we can find: (1) more terms with non-compositional semantics (suchas ost?eodermie (osteoderm), causalgie (causalgia), ad?eno?
?de (adenoid), or xanthochromie (xanthochromia)) forwhich the extracted paraphrases capture only part of the meaning; and (2) extractions that must be con-troled by the syntactic analysis (e.g.
petite boule de peau qui a sortie entre l?ongle et... (small skinballthat appeared between the nail and...) for micronychie (micronychia)) to make them more grammatical.
Para-phrases extracted from the Wiki corpus cover larger range of medical terms, while those extracted from100fora dedicated to a given medical topics are redundant.
On the whole, we can consider that the currentlyproposed method allows extracting interesting candidates as the paraphrases of technical terms, that areindeed much easier to understand than the technical terms by themselves.If we compare the obtained results with those presented in previous work, we can observe that:?
we extract paraphrases for larger number of terms: 343 terms with correct and possibly correctparaphrases (722 terms with paraphrases in total) in our work against a total of 65 and 82 in (Del?egerand Zweigenbaum, 2008), 109 in (Cartoni and Del?eger, 2011), and 152 in (Elhadad and Sutaria,2007).
In our work, the terms may receive more than one paraphrase;?
the precision values we obtain are comparable with those indicated in previous work: 67% and 60%in (Del?eger and Zweigenbaum, 2008), 66% in (Cartoni and Del?eger, 2011), and 58% in (Elhadadand Sutaria, 2007);?
in the cited work, the content of the corpora is explored but no reference is done to the set of termsexpected to be found.
Because we work with a termset, we can compute the recall.
If we consider theterms that can be analyzed morphologically (3,030 terms), and for which we can find the paraphraseswith the proposed method, the recall value is close to 10% with the correct paraphrases (299 terms),and to 24% with all the paraphrases extracted (722 terms).
Yet, it is not sure that all of the terms, thathave been analyzed morphologically, can be provided with paraphrases in the corpora processed.Besides, we should not forget that the nature of compounds and the decomposition of terms into com-ponents also mean that specific semantic relations exist between these components (Namer and Zweigen-baum, 2004; Booij, 2010).
These are inherent to the syntactic constructions extracted.
The characteristicsof these relations will be described and modeled in future work.5 Conclusions and Future workWe propose to exploit social media texts in order to detect paraphrases for technical medical terms,concentrating particularly on neoclassical compounds (e.g., myocardial, cholecystectomy, galactose,acromegaly).
The work is done in French.
The method relies on the morphological analysis of terms,on the ?translation?
of the components of terms in modern French words (e.g.
{card, heart}), and onthe projection of these words on corpora.
The method allows extracting correct and possibly correctparaphrases for up to 343 technical terms.
For covering larger set of terms, additional corpora must betreated.
The extracted paraphrases are easier to understand than the original technical terms.
Moreover,the semantic relations among the components, although non explicated, are conveyed by the paraphrases.We can consider that the method proves to be efficient and promising for the creation of lexicon suit-able for the simplification of medical texts.
Besides, the purpose of the method is to cover neoclassicalcompound terms that are usually non treated with automatic approaches, as they do not present clearformal similarity with their paraphrases.
One of the difficulties we have currently is related to the lack ofconstrains on the extracted segments.
In future work, we plan to apply the syntactic analysis for parsingthe extracted sentences.
Another possibility is to compute the probability for a given paraphrase to becorrect, which can rely for instance on frequency of the extracted paraphrases, on their syntactic struc-ture, etc.
In order to make the extraction of paraphrases more exhaustive, we will apply the method toother corpora and we will use additional resources (synonyms, associative resources) for performing theapproximate mapping of paraphrases.
In future work, we will take into account syntactically complexterms and not only simple words.
The very objective of our work is to exploit and test the resourcecreated for the simplification of medical texts.AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge the support of the Universit?e Paris 13 (project BQR Bonus Quality Research,2011), the support of the MESHS Lille projet?Emergent CoMeTe, and the support of the French AgenceNationale de la Recherche (ANR) and the DGA, under the Tecsan grant ANR-11-TECS-012.101ReferencesAMA.
