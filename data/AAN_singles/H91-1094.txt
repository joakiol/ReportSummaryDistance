Active Knowledge Structures in Natural Language UnderstandingComputing Research LaboratoryNew Mexico State UniversityPrincipal Investigator: Yorick Wilksyorick@nmsu.edu(505) 646-1835PROJECT GOALSTo investigate a theory of message anddiscourse understanding based on the building ofexplanatory causal models and the nested beliefsof discourse agents, so as to construct robust sys-tems for message understanding with widerapplication to machine translation and textretrieval.APPROACHWe view the task of the robust understand-ing of messages from texts and discourse as theuse of extraction of gists from a noisy back-ground by using techniques of (a) the recursivecomputation of agent's points of view of eachothers' environments, beliefs, expertise tc.
and(b) representations of those beliefs and expertiseas networks which are obtained by "best-fit"methods against stored knowledge structures.
Weimplement these high-level assumptions bymeans of different ypes of parsers (some moresyntactic, others more semantic) and the choicebetween these we see as purely empirical, basedon our evaluation methodology.
At present weare concentrating on PREMO-II, a semanticsbased parser which does contain some syntacticrules, but which can be weighted based on sta-tistical surveys of Navy message t xts.RECENT WORKWe have continued o work within theNavy message domain with this project since wewere late starters and wanted to get some resultsbefore switching over to new domains and texttypes (see below).
We have succeeded inintegrating the ViewGen belief manipulationsystem with the conceptual graph + MGRknowledge representation, soas to provide a sin-gle system that can both guide the messageparsers and represent he results of messageextraction.This rich representation has, in turn, beenlinked to the PREMO-II semantics-based parserthat parses Navy messages on the bases ofpreferences, anticipated metonymies closelylinked to preferences (e.g.CONTACT WENTSINKER), and the weighting of simple syntacticrules based on statistics of a large sample of suchmessages.
This type of method, although derivedfor general text has proved very suitable for "sys-tematically ungrammatical" text like the Navymessages.We have begun to investigate how toexpand these techniques to a different ext type,the longer terrorist messages, in conjunction withthe set of techniques we have proposed for theTIPSTER extraction program.Some of our effort under this contract hasbeen diverted to getting the ACL Consortium forLexical Research up and running before itsofficial DARPA funding date of March 1st.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARWe expect to take the shell of thePREMO-H method and provide it with a newdata-base of lexical entries, partly automaticallyderived from existing machine readable dic-tionaries and partly tuned against large textdata-bases.
Our standards of content in the lexi-cal entries for parsing will be those of thePustejovsky and Annick work at BrandeisUniversity, with whom we expect o collaborate.The method will also be integrated with surfacedemons for categories like proper names, countryand place names, company names, etc.
that havebeen derived separately by David MacDonald.These methods will give, we believe, a generaland robust method of extraction from documentson a large scale.420
