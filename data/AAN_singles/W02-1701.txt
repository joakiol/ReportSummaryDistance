Inform?tica, UPMMadrid, Spain, 28660rplaza@fi.upm.esABSTRACT12Although with the Semantic Web initiativemuch research on web page semantic annotationhas already been done by AI researchers,linguistic text annotation, including the semanticone, was originally developed in CorpusLinguistics and its results have been somehowneglected by AI.
The purpose of the researchpresented in this proposal is to prove thatintegration of results in both fields is not onlypossible, but also highly useful in order to makeSemantic Web pages more machine-readable.
Amulti-level (possibly multi-purpose and multi-language) annotation model based on EAGLESstandards and Ontological Semantics,implemented with last generation Semantic Weblanguages (RDF(S)/XML) is being developed to fitthe needs of both communities; the present paperfocuses on its semantic level.INTRODUCTIONAll of us are by now accustomed to makingextensive use of the so-called World Wide Web(WWW) which we might consider a great sourceof information, accessible through computers but,hitherto, only understandable to human beings.
Inits beginning, web pages were hand made,intended and oriented to the exchange ofinformation among human beings.
Due to theastonishing growth of Internet use, newtechnologies emerged and, with them, machine-aided web page generation appeared.
Up to thatpoint, the structure and the edition of these pagesfitted only human needs ?
and this, only to someextent.
All of these documents contained a hugeamount of text, images and even sounds,meaningless to a computer.
In this way, they put1 Dept.

of Computer Systems and Programming.on the reader the burden of extracting andinterpreting the relevant information in them.Currently, web page presentation in the WWWis being handled independently from its content,mainly through the use of XML (Bray et al,1998) or other resource-oriented languages asXOL (Karp et al, 1999), SHOE (Luke et al,2000), OML (Kent, 1998), RDF (Lassila et al,1999), RDF Schema (Brickley et al, 2000), OIL(Horrocks et al, 2000) or DAML+OIL (Horrockset al, 2001).
But even though the automaticprocess of information is being eased, the abovementioned tasks ?
relevant information access,extraction and interpretation ?
cannot be whollyperformed by computers yet.
Hence, the goal ofenabling computers to understand the meaning(the semantics) of written texts and web pages tomake it explicit to computers is gaining a growingrelevance.
That is the main pillar sustaining thedevelopment of what we understand by SemanticWeb: "the conceptual structuring of the web in anexplicit machine-readable way" (Berners-Lee etal., 1999).
In this context, the semantic annotationof texts makes meaning explicit, and has become akey topic.
Thus, great efforts are being devoted tothe design and application of models andformalisms for the semantic annotation of webpages to make these documents more machine-readable.Following the guidelines of the Semantic Webinitiative, much research has already been carriedout by AI researchers on the semantic annotationof web pages (Luke et al, 2000), (Benjamins etal., 1999), (Motta et al, 1999), (Staab et al,2000).
However, these researchers have neglected,somehow, the decades of work and the resultsobtained in the field of Corpus Linguistics oncorpus annotation, not only in the semantic level,but also in other linguistic levels.
These otherlinguistic levels, whilst not being intrinsicallysemantic, can also add some semantic informationand help a computer understand a text or, in ourcase, web pages.This paper will show the results of our researchon how linguistic annotation can help computersunderstand the text contained in a document ?
aSemantic Web document, for example.
Specialefforts are devoted to finding a way of bringingtogether and identifying complementaritiesbetween the semantic annotation models from AIand the annotations proposed by CorpusLinguistics.
As stated in this paper, far from beingirreconcilable, they are more than close and maybe considered complementary.This paper is organised as follows: firstly, anintroduction to the state of the art in text semanticannotation in corpus linguistics is presented(section 1).
Secondly, in section 2, some briefnotes on the use of ontologies in semanticannotation is sketched.
Thirdly, in section 3, anexample of the integration of both paradigms(AI?s and Corpus Linguistics?)
is presented in thescope of our project goals.
The main advantagesof this integration is analysed afterwards ?
section4 ?
and some conclusions are stated ?
section 5 ?,followed by the acknowledgments section and,finally, the references.1.
TEXT ANNOTATION IN CORPUSLINGUISTICSThe idea of text annotation was originallydeveloped in Corpus Linguistics.
Traditionally,linguists have defined corpus as "a body ofnaturally occurring (authentic) language datawhich can be used as a basis for linguisticresearch" (Leech, 1997).
Following McEnery &Wilson (2001), Corpus Linguistics was firstapplied to research on language acquisition, to theteaching of a second language or to theelaboration of descriptive grammars, etc.. Withthe arrival of computers, the number of potentialstudies to which corpora could be appliedincreased exponentially.
So, nowadays, the termcorpus is being applied to "a body of languagematerial which exists in electronic form, andwhich may be processed by computer for variouspurposes such as linguistic research and languageengineering" (Leech, 1997).
An annotatedcorpus "may be considered to be a repository oflinguistic information [...] made explicit throughconcrete annotation" (McEnery & Wilson, 2001).The benefit of such an annotation is clear: itmakes retrieving and analysing information aboutwhat is contained in the corpus quicker and easier.In Leech (1997), a list of the different (possible)levels of linguistic annotation can be found.
AsLeech himself states, for the time being, no corpusincludes all of them, but only two or, at most,three of them.
Some of them were only in theirfirst stage of conception at the time of writing hispaper.
A smaller but more realistic list ofannotation levels is included in EAGLES (1996a)namely: lemma, morpho-syntactic, syntactic,semantic and discourse annotation.
Standardrecommendations on morpho-syntactic andsyntactic annotation of corpora can be found in(EAGLES, 1996a) and (EAGLES, 1996b).
Acomplementary list of general criteria that shouldbe considered when elaborating an annotationscheme can be found in one of the results of theEAGLES project work, the Corpus EncodingStandard (CES, 2000) which are being taken intoaccount in the elaboration of our model (Aguadode Cea, 2002).
With respect to the previous andwell-known standardization initiative, TEI3, allthese works mentioned are TEI-compliant.
Thus,for the sake of brevity, we will focus on semanticannotation henceforth.As asserted in McEnery & Wilson (2001), twobroad types of semantic annotation may beidentified:A.
The marking of semantic relationshipsbetween items in the text (for example, theagents or patients of particular actions).
Thistype of annotation has scarcely begun to beapplied.B.
The marking of semantic features of words ina text, essentially the annotation of wordsenses in one form or another.
This trend hasquite a longer history but there is no universalagreement in semantics about which featuresof words should be annotated4.Although some preliminary recommendationson lexical semantic encoding have already beenposited (EAGLES, 1999), no EAGLES semanticcorpus annotation standard has yet beenpublished; nevertheless, for the second type ofsemantic annotation enunciated, a set of referencecriteria has been proposed by Schmidt and3 http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html4 See, for example, the controversies within the SENSEVALinitiative meetings ?
(Kilgarriff, 1998), (Kilgarriff & Rosenzweig,2000).mentioned in Wilson & Thomas (1997) forchoosing or devising a corpus semantic field5annotation system.
These criteria can besummarized as follows6:1.
It should make sense in linguistic orpsycholinguistic terms.2.
It should be able to account exhaustively forthe vocabulary in the corpus, not just for apart of it.3.
It should be sufficiently flexible.4.
It should operate at an appropriate level ofgranularity (or delicacy of detail).5.
It should, where appropriate, possess ahierarchical structure.6.
It should conform to a standard, if one exists7.2.
ONTOLOGIES AND SEMANTIC WEBANNOTATIONS.AI researchers have found in ontologies(Gruber, 1993), (Guarino et al, 1995), (Studer etal., 1998) the ideal knowledge model to formallydescribe web resources and its vocabulary and,hence, to make explicit in some way theunderlying meaning of the concepts included inweb pages.
With Ontological Semantics(Niremburg & Raskin, 2001) as a support theory8,the annotation of these web resources withontological information should allow intelligentaccess to them, should ease searching andbrowsing within them and should exploit new webinference approaches from them.
The influentialWordNet and EuroWordNet (Fellbaum, 2001)ontologies should be mentioned as valuableresources for this purpose.
Many systems andprojects have been developed towards this aimhitherto: SHOE (Luke et al, 2000) proposesHTML page semantic annotation with a Hornclause-based language also called SHOE; the(KA)2 initiative (Benjamins et al, 1999) seeks toannotate HTML documents with ontologicalinformation, taking Knowledge AcquisitionCommunity ontologies as a basis; PlanetOnto(Motta et al, 1999) aims at automaticallyannotating the HTML news pages of anorganisation by means of the information obtainedfrom an event-ontology based knowledge base;finally, within the Semantic Community WebPortals project (Staab et al, 2000) an ontology-based architecture for editing and maintainingweb portals in an easier way is being developed.Besides, a number of semantic annotation toolshave also been developed so far: COHSE(COHSE, 2002), MnM (Vargas-Vera et al, 2001),OntoMat-Annotizer (OntoMat, 2002), SHOEKnowledge Annotator (SHOE, 2002) andAeroDAML (AeroDAML, 2002).3.
INTEGRATION OF PARADIGMS: ANEXAMPLEThe model here shown, OntoTag, is developedwithin ContentWeb, a Ministry funded project,which aims at creating an ontology-basedplatform to enable users to query e-commerceapplications by using natural language,performing the automatic retrieval of informationfrom web documents annotated with ontologicaland linguistic information.
Besides, a prototype inthe entertainment domain will be developed.ContentWeb objectives can be found in (Aguadode Cea, 2002).Within the elaboration of OntoTag, a firstexploration phase has been performed.
A shortexample of this first phase is presented next.
It hasbeen implemented in RDF(S), but an XMLversion was also developed and the possibility ofusing any other language has a priori not beendiscarded.
In the annotation example given below,two different morpho-syntactic tools wereapplied: Conexor (Conexor, 2002) and MBT(MBT, 2002).
Some other tools are beingevaluated for further use and the XML andRDF(S) annotation tools and wrappers are beingdesigned at the moment.5 A semantic field (sometimes also called a conceptual field, asemantic domain or a lexical domain) is a theoretical constructwhich groups together words that are related by virtue of theirbeing connected ?
at some level of generality ?
with the samemental concept (Wilson & Thomas, 1997).6  For a more detailed explanation, see (Aguado de Cea, 2002).7 Once again the SENSEVAL initiatives must be mentioned: theyreveal the demand for semantic standardization in the field of wordsense disambiguation (Kilgarriff, 1998), (Kilgarriff & Rosenzweig,2000).8 Ontological Semantics (Niremburg & Raskin, 2001) is a theory ofmeaning in natural language and an approach to natural languageprocessing (NLP) which uses a constructed world model ?
theontology ?
as the central resource for extracting and representingmeaning of natural language texts, reasoning about knowledgederived from texts as well as generating natural language textsbased on representations of their meaning.Figure 1: Morpho-Syntactic AnnotationExcerpt.3.1.
RDF(S) EXAMPLEDESCRIPTIONIn Figure 1, Figure 2and Figure 3,we can see the annotation of thefollowing Spanish sentence in thefirst three levels ?Tras cinco a?os deespera y despu?s de muchashabladur?as, llega a nuestraspantallas la pel?cula m?s esperadade los ?ltimos tiempos.

ADVANTAGES OF THE INTEGRATEDMODELAs shown in the previous section example, itseems that AI and Corpus Linguistics, far frombeing irreconcilable, can join together to givebirth to an integrated annotation model.
Thisconjunct annotation scheme would be very usefuland valuable in the development of the SemanticWeb and would benefit from the results of bothdisciplines in many ways, not restricted to thesemantic level, below analysed.
A particularsubsection is dedicated to multi-functionality4.1.
AT THE SEMANTIC LEVELLet us now see the benefits at the semanticlevel of a hybrid annotation model, first from alinguistic point of view and, then, from anontological point of view.4.1.1.
Regarding ontologies from a linguisticpoint of viewTaking a closer view to sections 1 and 2, andcomparing the proposals from both CorpusLinguistics and AI, we find out that the use ofontologies as a basis for a semantic annotationscheme fits perfectly and accomplishes the criteriaposited by Schmidt.
Clearly, its mostlyhierarchical structure fulfils by itself criterion (5)and, as a side effect, criteria (2) and (4), since theformer is related to the capacity of an ontology togrow horizontally (in breadth) and the latter to thecapacity of an ontology to grow vertically (indepth or in specification).
Hence, the end user candecide the level of specificity needed.
Criterion(3) is also satisfied by an ontology-based semanticannotation scheme, since we can always specialisethe concepts in the ontology according to specificperiods, languages, registers and textbases.Ontologies are, by definition, consensual and,thus, are closer to becoming a standard than manyother models and formalisms or, as criteria (6)requires, at least they lay a framework ofproperties and axioms (principles) and majorcategories that can be modified to some extent tofit individual needs.
Concerning criterion (1),quite a lot of groups developing ontologies arecharacterized by a strong interdisciplinaryapproach that combines Computer Science,Linguistics and (sometimes) Philosophy; thus, anontology-based approach should also make sensein linguistic terms.4.1.2.
Regarding linguistic annotations froman ontological point of viewThe main drawback for AI researchers to adopta linguistically motivated annotation model wouldlie on the statement in section 1 that says, ?there isno universal agreement in semantics about whichfeatures of words should be annotated?
or on thatother statement in Schmidt?s criterion 1, in thesame section, that says, ?still an exhaustive set ofcategories is to be determined?.But ontology researchers are trying to fill thisgap with initiatives such as the UNSPSC(UNSPSC, 2002) or RosettaNet (RosettaNet,2002) in specific domains (i.e.
e-commerce).
Inany case, linguistic annotations at the semanticlevel are more ambitious and potentially widerthan the strictly ontology-based ones.
Establishinga link between semantic annotation and discourseannotation and text construction following theRST approach, which has already been applied intext generation (Mann & Thomson, 88), seems afairly promising linguistic enhancement.So far, we have seen how ontologies can fit inthe semantic annotation of texts; let us see in thenext subsections how linguistic annotations in allof its levels can improve the potential of SemanticWeb Pages.4.2.
MULTI-FUNCTIONALITYThe need for (shallow) parsing in semanticprocessing is found in Vargas-Vera et al (2001)and also in Kietz et al(2000): most informationextraction systems (as well as other NLPapplications) use some form of shallow parsing11to recognise syntactic constructs or, in otherwords, to syntactically identify some fragments ofthe sentences.
A chunker12 called Marmot isincluded in the annotation process presented in the11 Without generating a complete parse tree for each sentence.
Suchpartial parsing has the advantages of greater speed and robustness.12 A chunker is a natural language (pre)processing tool that separatesand segments sentences into its subconstituents, i.e.
noun, verb andprepositional phrases, etc.former.
Even though this need for lower levels oflinguistic analysis mentioned hitherto applies toinformation extraction systems, it is not restrictedto this kind of NLP applications.
Since theproposed annotation model adds overt linguisticinformation to any kind of document, then it canbe used for a wide range of purposes that require alinguistic or semantic analysis or processing (i.e.machine-aided translation, information retrieval,etc.).5.
CONCLUSIONSWe have seen that, even though AI researchersare devoting many efforts to finding an optimalmodel for the semantic annotation of web pages,the decades of work and the results obtained in thefield of Corpus Linguistics on corpus annotationhave been, somehow, neglected.
This paper showsthe results of the research carried out on howlinguistic annotation can help computersunderstand the text contained in a document ?
aSemantic Web page ?
bringing together semanticannotation models from AI and the annotationsproposed for every linguistic level from CorpusLinguistics.The integration of these two approaches(Corpus Linguistics and AI) entails manyadvantages for language engineering and AIapplications.
First of all, language resources willbe more reusable: many of the projects involvingthe use of semantically annotated (web)documents must also parse to some extent theinformation and, prior to that, must determinesomehow the grammatical category associated toevery word in the document.
Introducing theannotation of these two levels into the document,hence re-using one of the tools already developedfor this purpose, prevents this whole process ofdocument text tokenisation and parsing orchunking from being unnecessarily repeated eachtime the document is processed (reusing theannotation).
Since parsing, for example, is a hightime-consuming task, we can have an additionaladvantage, that is, reducing our overall SemanticWeb page processing time.
The second mainadvantage is that the meaning of a page withexplicit semantic annotation can be reinforced bythe meaning contribution provided by all of thelinguistic levels; semantic analysis can alsobenefit from the invaluable work done so far onthe development of ontologies as conceptual andconsensual models.However, the main disadvantage lies in thelimitations imposed by current technologies:obtaining automatically compact, readable andverifiable pages is a task hard to be fully specifiedand delimited, but the work being done in ourlaboratory tries to bring some light upon it.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe research described in this paper issupported by MCyT (Spanish Ministry of Scienceand Technology) under the project name:ContentWeb: ?PLATAFORMA TECNOL?GICAPARA LA WEB SEM?NTICA: ONTOLOG?AS,AN?LISIS DE LENGUAJE NATURAL YCOMERCIO ELECTR?NICO?
