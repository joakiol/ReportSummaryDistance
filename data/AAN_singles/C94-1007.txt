A BIDIRECTIONAL,  TRANSFER-DRIVEN MACHINETRANSLAT ION SYSTEM FOR SPOKEN DIALOGUESYasuhiro SOBASHIMA, Osamu FURUSE, Susumu AKAMINE, Jun KAWAI,and Hitoshi I IDAA TR Interpreting Telecommunications Re earch LaboratoriesABSTRACTThis paper presents a brief overview of thebidirectional (Japanese and English) Transfer-Driven Machine Translation system, currentlybeing developed at ATR.
The aim of thisdevelopment is to achieve bidirectional spokendialogue translation using a new translationtechnique, TDMT, in which an example-basedframework is fully utilized to translate the wholesentence.
Although the translation coverage ispresently restricted to conference registration, thesystem meets requirements for spoken dialoguetranslation, such as two-way translation, highspeed, and high accuracy with robust processing.1.
INTRODUCTIONTransfer-Driven Machine Translation\[ll,\[2\],\[9\],(TDMT) is a translation technique which utilizesempirical transfer knowledge compiled fromactual translation examples.
The main part oftranslation is performed by the transfer modulewhich applies the transfer knowledge to each inputsentence.
Other modules, such as lexicalprocessing, analysis, and generation, cooperatewith the transfer module to improve translationperformance.
With this t ransfer -centeredtranslation mechanism together with the example-based f'ramework\[3\],\[4\].\[5\], which conducts distancecalculations between linguistic expressions usingthe semantic hierarchy, TDMT performs efficientand robust ranslation.TDMT is especially useful for spoken languagetranslation, since spoken language expressionstend to deviate from conventional grammars andsince applications dealing with spoken languages,such as automat ic  te lephone in terpreta -tion\[6\],\[7l,\[S\], need efficient and robust processing tohandle diverse inputs.
A prototype system ofTDMT which performs bidirectional translation(Japanese to English and English to Japanese)has been implemented.
This bidirectionaltranslat ion system simulates the dialoguesbetween two speakers speaking in differentlanguages (Japanese and English) using aninterpreting telephone system.
Experimentalresults have shown TDMT to be promising forspoken dialogue translation.2.
TRANSFER-DRIVENARCHITECTUREThe bidirectional TDMT system, shown in Figure1, translates English into Japanese and Japaneseinto English.
Conversion of the translationdirection is simply done by flipping the modeselection switch.
Moreover, all of the sharableprocessing modules are used in both translations.This bidirectional translation capability, alongwith other features adopted tbr spoken language,shows the possibil ity of two-way dialoguetranslation.The transfer module, which is the heart of theTDMT system, transfers  source languageexpressions into target language xpressions usingbilingual translation knowledge.
When anotherlanguage-dependent processing, such as lexicalprocessing, analysis, or generation, is necessary toobtain a proper target expression, the requiredmodule is called by the transfer module.
In otherwords, all modules in a TDMT system function as apart of or hell) the transfer module.
This transfer-centered architecture simplifies the configurationas well as the control of the machine translationsystem.English TerminalJapanese TerminalFig.

TRANSLATION MECHANISM3.1 Examplc -based  analys is  and t rans ferThe TDMT system uti l izes an example-basedframework to translate a sentence.
The centralmechanism of this f ramework it; the distancecalculation\[4\],\[5\], which is measured in terms of athesaurus hierarchy.
We adopt the calculations ofSumita\[51.F igure  2 shows an example  of the t rans ferknowldege tbr the Japanese pattern "X no Y."
(Xand Y are lexical  var iab les  and "no" is anadnominal particle.
X' represents the Englishtranslation for X, and the English translations arenoted in braces after the Japanese words forreaders' convenience.
)X no Y --~Y' ofX' ((ronbun {paper}, daimohu {title}) .... ),Y' for X' ((beya {room}, yoyaku {reserwltion}) .... ),Y' in X' ((Tokyo {Tokyo}, haigi {conference}) ....),X' Y' ((en{yen}, heya {room}) .... ),Fig.
2 An Example  of T rans fer  KnowledgeThe first transfer knowledge, "X no Y - ,  Y' of X'(ronbun {paper}, daimoku {title})" represents thetranslat ion example that a set (ronbun{paper},daimoku{title}) in structure "X no Y' is transferredinto structure "Y' of X'."
Thus, pattern selection isconducted using such examples.
When the sourcepattern "X no Y" is applied to an input, the transfermodule compares the actual words tbr X and g withthe sets of examples, searches for the nearestexample set with its distance score, and providesthe most appropriate transferred pattern.For example, if the Japanese input is "Kyoto nokaigi" and the nearest example set (X, Y) would be(Tokyo, kaigi), then the transfer module selects "Y'in X'" as the translat ion pat tern  and outputs"conference in Kyoto."
Thus, bil ingual transferknowledge consisting of patterns and translationexamples is used in TDMT to select, the mostappropriate translation.To analyze a whole source sentence and to form itstarget  structure,  the transfer module appl iesvarious kinds of bil ingual transfer knowledge tothe source sentencet.ql.
Figure 3 is a list of differenttypes of bi l ingual transfer knowledge (patternsand words), that are used with examples to analyzethe Japanese expression "torokuyoushi wa sudenio-mochi deshou ha" and to form its transferredresult "do you already have the registration tbrm.
"As shown in Figure 4, both the source and targetstructures are formed based on the distancecalculation.
The numbers in brackets representthe transfer knowledge pairs in Figure 3.X dcshou ka --~ do you X' (1)X wa Y - ~ Y' X' (2)sudeni X --, already X' (3)o-.
X -~ X' (4)torokuyoushi ~-~ registration form (5)mochi -~ have (6)Fig.
3 Var ious  Kinds of Transfer  KnowledgeAs we have seen, the example-based framework isemployed in the transfer module of the TDMTsystem, in which bil ingual transfer knowledge isused for both analyzing and transferring the inputsentence cooperatively.
In other words, in thetransfer  module, both the source and targetstructm'es are formed by applying the bil ingualtransfer knowledge extracted from the exampledatabase.Source Sentence: "torokuyoushi wa sudeni o-mochi deshou ks" \]4,Source structure Tarzet st,uetu,'c?de ho,,l.

4 A Trans fer  Example  for "torokuyoushi  wa sudeni  o-mochi deshou ka"653.2 Structural disambiguationMultiple source structures may be produced inaccordance with the application of the bilingualtransfer knowledge.
In such cases, the mostappropriate structure is chosen by computing thetotal distances for all possible combinations ofpart ia l  t rans lat ions  and by select ing thecombination with the smallest total distance.
Thestructure with the smallest total distance is judgedto be most consistent with the empir icalknowledge, and is chosen as the most plausiblestructure.
(See \[9\] for details of the distance andtotal distance calculations.
)For instance, when the pattern "X no Y" is appliedto the expression "ichi-man en {10,000 yen} noheya{room} no yoyaku{reservation}," there are twopossible structures.1) ichi-man en no (heya no~)2) ( ichi-man en no heAL ~)  no ~The TDMT system calculates the total distance foreach of the structures 1) and 2) using the bilingualtransfer knowledge stored in the system.
Thefollowing are the target structures when thetransfer knowledge in Figure 2 is applied.
(Sourcestructures 1 and 2 give target structures 1' and 2',respectively.
)1') 10,000 yen (reservation for room)2') reservation for (10,000 yen room)In this case, (en{yen}, yoyaku{reservation}) i  1 issemantically distant from the examples of "X noY," which increases the total distance for struc-ture 1.
Figure 5 illustrates the two sets of sourceand target structures generated by the transfermodule of the TDMT system.3.3 Sentence generationThe generation module completes the translationof the transferred sentence using target languageknowledge that is not provided at the transferstage.
This module performs the following twotasks in cooperation with the transfer module.1) Grammatical sentence generation:It determines  the word order andmorphological inflections, and generateslexically essential words, like articles inEnglish, so that the whole sentence is fullygrammatical.2) Natural sentence generation:It brushes up the sentence by changing,adding, or deleting word(s) so that the wholesentence is as natural as a spoken dialoguesentence.Figure 6 shows an example of Japanese naturalsentence generation where addition of a politeauxil iary adverb and deletion of redundantpronouns take place.~ "I will send you the form"Transfer I "~~:~:~:~:~:~: watasht-waanata-n~ youshi-wo okuru"iiiiii!iiiiiiii I {I~,= {to you} {the form} {send}Generation Jl clglete ~ ......... ...,.add' ~?

Thesystem simulates the communication between anapplicant (Japanese speaker) and a secretary(Engl ish speaker).
The dialogue history isdisplayed at the bottom of the screen.
In thescreen, Terminal A is the applicant's terminal andTerminal  B is the secretary's terminal .
Thetranslated sentences are displayed in reverse video(white on black).4.3 System per formanceThe system has been trained with 825 Japanesesentences for J-E translat ion and 607 Englishsentences fl)r E-J translation.
These sentenceswere selected from the ATR corpora and typicaldialogues about the domain.
The system cantranslate sentences with a vocabulary of 1500words.
In J-E translation, the system on a Lispmachine with 10MIPS performance has providedan average translation time of 1.9 seconds forsentences having an average length of 9.2 words,and a success rate of about 70% for open testsentences ofthis domain.7-LDM T "" "':'- .
