Paris-Sorbonne Maison de la Recherche 28 rue Serpente, 75006 ParisAbstractOne emergent field in text mining tools ap-plied to biological texts is the automatic de-tection of speculative sentences.
In this pa-per, we test on a large scale BioExcom, arule-based system which annotates and ca-tegorizes automatically speculative sen-tences (?prior?
and ?new?).
This workenables us to highlight a more restrictiveway to consider speculations, viewed as asource of knowledge, and to discuss the cri-teria used to determine if a sentence is spe-culative or not.
By doing so, we demonstratethe efficiency of BioExcom to extract thesetypes of speculations and we argue the im-portance of this tool for biologists, who arealso interested in finding hypotheses.1 IntroductionIn one of the first studies about biologicalspeculations in Natural Language Processing,Light et al (2004) have reported that biologistscan have a dual posture concerning this sub-ject:?In the context of information retrieval, an ex-ample information need might be ?I am lookingfor speculations about the X gene in liver tis-sue.?
One of the authors spoke at a researchdepartment of a drug company and the biolo-gists present expressed this sort of informationneed.
On the other hand, one of the authors hasalso encountered the opposite need: ?I am look-ing for definite statements about transcriptionfactors that interact with NF Kappa B.?
Boththese information needs would be easier to ful-fill if automated annotation of speculative pas-sages was possible.?
(Light et al, 2004)In this quotation, the term ?speculation?
hasnot exactly the same meaning in these twostatements (depending if it comes from compu-tational linguists or from biologists).
Indeed,because biologists are almost interested inknowing only factual statements, the informa-tion extraction tools have to remove all uncer-tain statements, identified as hedging or specu-lation, or at least to present them separatelyfrom definite results.
Consequently, the vastmajority of Natural Language Processing toolsdealing with the identification of speculationhave followed this very large meaning of theword ?speculation?, in order to avoid extract-ing uncertain information as factual informa-tion (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008; Medlock,2008; Szarvas, 2008; Morante and Daelemans,2009; ?zgur and Radev, 2009).
To help im-prove the information extraction tools, a cor-pus, called BioScope, has been annotated forspeculation, negation and its linguistic scopesin biomedical texts (Szarvas et al, 2008).However, when a biologist says he is inter-ested in knowing all speculations about a bio-logical entity (gene or protein for example) ora biological process, this claim concernsanother meaning of the word ?speculation?.The latter is in this case more restrictive thanpreviously, and close to the notion of hypothe-sis and uncertain proposal.
This interest of bi-ologists can be explained by different reasons.Firstly, since speculations give meaning to re-sults, they sometimes carry more useful infor-mation than factual sentences.
In addition, spe-culative sentences emphasize important data,which can be very useful in data-collectionpapers (genomic and post-genomic papers, see(Brent and Lok, 2005)).
Finally, speculationscan also give current trends or directions, byenabling the researchers to anticipate futureexperimental discoveries, or by suggestingother ways to envision biological problems andgiving new ideas for future experiments (Bla-gosklonny and Pardee, 2002).
Hence, despiteits importance for biologists, the need to findspeculation according to this view has beenneglected until now in Natural Language32Processing.
To our knowledge, the only workfocusing specifically on this issue is the devel-opment of the rule-based system BioExcom(Descl?s et al, 2009).
Since BioExcom hasobtained good results for detecting specula-tions but in a relatively small scale evaluation,it seems useful to test this tool on a large, un-known corpus like BioScope.
Furthermore, it isimportant to compare in greater detail thesetwo different approaches to characterize spe-culative sentences and see more precisely inwhat they differ.We performed an automatic annotation ofthe BioScope corpus by BioExcom and wemeasured raw performance.
We observed thatthe vast majority of the divergences betweenBioExcom results and BioScope were due tothe criteria used for detecting a speculativesentence.
We manually treated the divergingsentences in order to correctly evaluate BioEx-com according to its own criteria.The contributions of this paper are the fol-lowing:?
We present an original approach for consi-dering speculative sentences in bio text min-ing.
It concerns the definition of a specula-tion, the criteria used to find it and its im-portance for biologists.?
We demonstrate the efficiency of BioEx-com to recognize these statements on alarge-scale evaluation with good results.?
According to this new approach we pro-vide an annotated corpus freely available inorder to be used by researchers.2 Related workHyland (1995) has extensively studied hedg-ing, from a linguistic perspective, (the term ofhedging has been introduced by Lakoff (1972))in biological papers.
Hedging represents anabsence of certainty and is employed toindicate either a lack of commitment to thetruth value of an accompanying proposition;either a desire not to express that commitmentcategorically.
Three main functions areoutlined for hedging: weakening the strengthof a statement, signalling uncertainty andexpressing deference to the reader.From a Natural Language Processing pers-pective, the first work was carried out by Lightet al (2004).
After a linguistic study of the useof speculative language in MEDLINE ab-stracts, the authors tested the possibility of ma-nually annotating the speculative sentences byexperts and linguists whilst providing smallannotation guidelines.
They concluded thathumans can reliably annotate speculative sen-tences but that it is not possible to distinguishbetween ?high?
speculations and ?low?
specu-lations.
Furthermore they performed an expe-riment with different automated methods basedprincipally on the retrieval of keywords.
Wil-bur et al (2006) defined five qualitative di-mensions for scientific text annotations.
Twoof them concerned speculative statements (cer-tainty and evidence) and they defined variousguidelines for annotating text using them.Medlock and Briscone (2007) providedmuch more detailed guidelines for hedge de-tection.
A linguist and a domain expert withoutany input into the guideline developmentprocess, labelled a publicly available dataset(FlyBase dataset, consisting of 6 papers onDrosophila melanogaster) in order to performa probabilistic acquisition model and to test it.A separation of the acquisition and classifica-tion phases in semi-supervised machine learn-ing was used.Svarzas (2008) managed to devise a hedgeclassification in biomedical texts based on aweakly supervised selection of keywords.
Toevaluate their system, they manually annotatedfour papers of BMC Bioinformatics with thesame criteria as Medlock and Briscone (2007).They obtained an F-Measure of 85% on theFlyBase dataset and an F-Measure of 75% onthe BMC Bioinformatics dataset, when thetraining was carried out with the FlyBase data-set, demonstrating that the probability of theirhedge classifiers is limited.To recognize speculative sentences, Kili-coglu and Bergler (2008) also used speculativekeywords from prior linguistic work and ex-panded them by WordNet, UMLS SpecialistLexicon, and by introducing syntactic patterns.In order to determine the speculative strengthof sentences, they assigned speculative cues toweights in two methods.
They worked on thetwo publicly available corpora, obtaining an F-Measure of 85% on the FlyBase data set andan F-Measure of 82% on the BMC Bioinfor-matics data.The BioScope corpus is a manually anno-tated corpus for speculation and negation key-words (token level), and their linguistic scopes(sentence level) (Szarvas et al, 2008).
Thiscorpus is publicly available1 and the annotation1 http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/bioscope33process has been performed by two indepen-dent annotators and a chief linguist.
In particu-lar, the corpus consists of 9 full texts papers(five papers from the FlyBase dataset and fourpapers from the journal BMC Bioinformatics),and 1273 abstracts (from the Genia Corpus(Collier et al, 1999)).
The annotation guide-lines are provided and speculation is identifiedto uncertainty and hedging.
However the crite-ria used here are not detailed very accurately,unlike the detailed work of Medlock and Bris-cone (2007).In order to detect hedging but also theirscope, two recent works were recentlypublished.
Morante and Daelemans (2009)present a machine learning system based on aprevious system used to detect the scope ofnegation cues.
Thus they show that the samescope finding system can be applied to bothnegation and hedging.
They used the threesubcropora of the BioScope corpus to test theefficiency of their system: the best F-Measuresthey obtained were 85% on the abstracts (10-fold cross-validation experiments), 72% on theFull Text Papers and 60% on the Clinicalreports for hedge detection (training phase onthe full abstract subcorpus).
?zgur and Radev(2009) built also a system that detects specula-tions and their scopes in biomedical scientifictexts.
They performed a supervised classifica-tion task, where they classified the potentialkeywords as real speculation keywords or notby using a diverse set of linguistic features thatrepresent the contexts of the keywords.
Theyobtained F-Measure of 92% for the scientificabstracts (10-fold cross-validationexperiments).
The F-Measure for Full TextPapers (leave-one-out-cross-validation) was83%.3 BioExcomEXCOM2  (Djioua et al, 2006; Alrahabi, 2010)is a rule-based system using the computationalprinciples of the Contextual Explorationprocessing (Descl?s, 2006).
EXCOM does notneed any morpho-syntactic analysis and onlyrequires one pre-treatment step of corpus seg-mentation into segments (which are sentencesor sometimes clauses according to the punctua-tion) (Figure 1).
EXCOM uses declarativerules built by linguists or domain experts andbased on the search for linguistic markers inthe text.
The latter are hierarchically organized2 http://www.excom.fr/into the rules: they are either indicators (strongmarkers) or clues (complementary markers).Only the presence of indicators in the texttriggers the associated CE rules, and then theadditional clues can be searched for in thecontext defined by the rules, which is in ourcase the same sentence as the indicator (Figure2).Figure 1: Overview of Excom processing (Alrahabi,2010)EXCOM allows the use of alreadyannotated segments as markers, and also toorder the rules and to use ?negative?
clues thatcancel certain rules.
The clues can be arrangedbetween each other and versus the indicator (atits left, right or inside it).
They are used to con-firm, invalidate or specify an annotation car-ried by an indicator.
If all the examinedconditions of a rule are satisfied, EXCOMattributes the corresponding annotation to thedesignated segment.
Generally the indicatorsare interconnected into graphs called ?semanticmaps?
(Alrahabi and Descl?s, 2008).
EXCOMhas been used for various tasks such as auto-matic summarization, relationships betweenconcepts, categorization of bibliographic cita-tions and reported speech.BioExcom is the system that uses the anno-tation performed by EXCOM thanks tospecific linguistic resources built for detectingspeculations in biomedical papers (Descl?s etal., 2009).
Furthermore, BioExcom performsan indexation of the annotated segments in or-der to provide the possibility of searching for34specific terms.
The rules used for the annota-tion processing are based on a precise semanticanalysis of the multiple ways to express specu-lation performed by an expert in about seventybiological papers.
BioExcom also categorizesspeculative segments into ?new speculation?
(speculative sentences presented for the firsttime in the paper or not explicitly presented asprior speculation) and ?prior speculation?
(speculative sentences cited in the paper, butpresented as having been proposed previously).BioExcom uses thirty rules, based on twelveindicator classes.Figure 2: The contextual exploration principles:search for an indicator and then for some clues in acontextual space (a sentence or a clause in our case)according to some associated rules.The criteria used to find speculations are de-scribed in detailed annotation guidelines,which are available on line 3 .
Only the seg-ments containing at least one linguistic elementexpressing speculation are considered.
A spec-ulation is defined as a proposal still not dem-onstrated about a biological issue and explicit-ly presented as uncertain in the paper.
Thus,speculations are considered as potentialsources of relevant information for biologists.Others types of statements such as deductions,conclusions, arguments and discussions are notconsidered as speculative but as intermediarystatements, because they either present con-cepts more or less certain, or they do not makea proposal.It is worth noting that contrary to other ap-proaches, like Medlock (2008), the open ques-tions are not speculative because they only aska question about a biological problem withoutproposing a mechanism (sentence 1).3 http://www.bioexcom.net/(1) How endocytosis of DI leads to theactivation of N remains to beelucidated.In order to better illustrate what a proposalis and how BioExcom performs annotation wecan compare this sentence with the example(2) where BioExcom finds the indicator ?is notknown?.
Nevertheless, as the goal of this tool isnot to extract all sentences expressinguncertainty, BioExcom searches for the clue?whether?
at the right or at the left of the indi-cator.
The presence of this clue indicates that,contrary to the sentence (1) with ?how?, thesentence (2) proposes a mechanism andconsequently is a speculation.
(2) Also, whether the signaling activity ofSer is similarly regulated byendocytosis is not known.The sentences which discuss a speculationwithout being informative about the content ofthe speculation are also not considered asspeculations (sentence 3, extracted from theguidelines of Medlock (2008)).
Indeed the goalof BioExcom is to detect a sentence explaining,at least partially, a speculation, and not toknow, as the example (3), whether a specula-tion is purely speculative or is supported (ornot) by facts.
For the same reason, BioExcomextracts speculation without taking into ac-count whether this speculation is denied or not.
(3) The rescue of the D-mib mutantphenotype by ectopic expression ofNeur strongly supports thisinterpretationAt present, the evaluation process of BioEx-com has only been performed on a relativelysmall scale (2 full-text papers read by five ex-perts and containing 59 speculative sentencesin total) and after the automatic annotationprocess (Descl?s et al, 2009).
Promising re-sults have been reported for BioExcom in de-tecting speculations, by providing a high Preci-sion of 98,3%, and a Recall of 95,1% (F-Measure of 96,7%).
This rate is consistent withthe goal of BioExcom to be a monitoring anddecision support tool.354 Raw evaluationThe Bioscope corpus (Szarvas et al, 2008)consists of three parts; namely medical freetexts, biological full papers and biologicalscientific abstracts.
However in this test, weonly used two parts of the Bioscope corpus(full papers and abstracts) because we werepreferentially interested in the biomedicalscientific domain.First, we cleaned the corpus from all elementtags (angled brackets marking hedge keywordsand parentheses marking scopes) and savedthese documents into text files.
The latter couldthen be automatically segmented into sen-tences or clauses and semantically annotatedby BioExcom.
As a result of this processing,BioExcom automatically extracted 341 seg-ments from the Full Text Papers Corpus and1489 segments from the Abstract Corpus (1830segments in total)4 .
We could then compareour output files with the Bioscope Corpuswhich contained manual annotations.
In thistask we do not consider the categorization ofBioExcom (?new speculation?
and ?priorspeculation?)
and these annotated sentencesare only considered as speculative.
Thus, weobtained the results presented in Table 1.
Con-sistent with the previous evaluation performedon BioExcom (Descl?s et al, 2009), the Preci-sion is high (approximately 93% in average,calculated from the total of segments of thetwo corpora).
Nevertheless, the Recall dramat-ically falls to approximately 68% (in average)compared to the first evaluation (Recall of93%).Precision Recall F-MeasureFull Text Pa-pers89,35 62,92 73,84Abstracts 94,75 68,83 79,74Table 1: Summary of raw results for BioExcomevaluationPresented briefly are comments and someannotations performed by BioExcom which arein agreement with BioScope.4 The results of the annotation of BioScope corpus byBioExcom are publicly available:http://www.bioexcom.net/.
It is worth mentioning that afew sentences were not segmented exactly in the sameway by BioExcom and in the BioScope corpus(approximately 2% of divergences).
We based all ourcalculations on BioExcom segmentation.
(4) High conservation of residues near theinframe stop codon also suggests theimportance of this region.
(5)  Therefore, sets of genes identified fromco-expression data may often containmultiple extraneous upstreamsequences.
(6)  To test the hypothesis that cortivazolacts in dex-resistant cells by makinguse of the residual GR found there,wild-type and dex-resistant cloneswere treated with variousconcentrations of cortivazol and theinduction of GR mRNA was studied.
(7) To determine whether specific mem-bers of the NF-kappa B family contri-bute to this effect, we examined theabilities of different NF-kappa B subu-nits to act with Tat-I to stimulatetranscription of HIV in Jurkat T-leukemia cells.If we compare the speculative keywords in-dicated in BioScope (underlined) and themarkers used by BioExcom, we see some con-vergences (?suggests?
and ?may?
for the sen-tences (4) and (5)), but also some divergences.In the sentence (6), BioExcom uses ?hypothe-sis that?
as an indicator in order to extract in-formative speculations and not only sentencescontaining the word ?hypothesis?.
The exam-ple of the sentence (7) is much more illustra-tive for the differences: whereas only ?wheth-er?
is taken into account as a keyword in Bi-oScope, BioExcom uses ?to determine?
as anindicator and ?whether?
as a positive clue, al-lowing extracting only sentences containing aproposal (see example 2).
The minimaliststrategy (searching for the minimal unit thatexpresses speculation) followed by the annota-tors of BioScope for the keywords can explainthese observations.5 Corrected evaluationOur goal was to evaluate the performance ofBioExcom according to its own definition ofspeculation.
To analyze the observed low Re-call (Table 1), we assumed that all sentencespresenting an agreement between both me-thods (manual annotation in BioScope and au-tomatic annotation by BioExcom) were cor-rectly annotated and we checked manually allthe segments (984 segments) presenting a di-vergence of annotation.
This checking was per-formed by a biologist as chief evaluator (writer36of the annotation guidelines) and two indepen-dent linguists, not allowed to communicatewith each other.
None of these evaluators knewthe annotation performed by BioExcom or inBioScope (blind study).
The conflicts wereresolved by discussions during regular meet-ings and, in case of important uncertainty for atleast two annotators, the sentences (54 in total)were not taken into account.
The BioScopecorpus re-annotated according to the criteria ofBioExcom is publicly available5.We can divide the segments presenting adisagreement between BioExcom and BioS-cope into two groups depending on the annota-tion performed either automatically by BioEx-com or manually in the BioScope corpus (Fig-ure 3).The first group consists of 865 segmentswhich were considered as speculations in Bi-oScope (representing around 36% of the totalof annotated sentences in BioScope) and whichwere not annotated by BioExcom (see Figure2).
After manual checking, we found that onlyaround one third of these segments in the cor-pus Full papers were speculative according tothe criteria of BioExcom.
This proportion wasaround one fourth in the BioScope corpus Ab-stract.
The goal of BioExcom to avoid annotat-ing open questions (see examples (1-2)) or lackof knowledge (sentence (8)) can explain someof the absences of annotation by BioExcom.
(8) The exact role of the ubiquitinationpathway in regulating apoptosis is stillunclear.In other cases, some differences linked tothe semantic conception of speculation play arole.
Thus, the following sentences are consi-dered as speculative in BioScope:(9) Furthermore, genetic andtransplantation studies indicate thatboth Neur and Mib act in a non-autonomous manner[18,21,22,23,25,29], indicating thatendocytosis of Dl is associated withincreased Dl signalling activity.
(10) It can be deduced that the erythroidALAS precursor protein has a molecu-lar weight of 64.6 kd, and is similar insize to the previously isolated human5 http://www.bioexcom.net/housekeeping ALAS precursor of mo-lecular weight 70.6 kd.Although these sentences correspond tohedging as it has been defined by Hyland(1995), we argue that the sentences (9-10) canbe characterized more as a demonstration or adeduction with the expressions ?indicate that?and ?it can be deduced?
than a speculation.According to the criteria used for establishingBioExcom rules, these sentences do not cor-respond to a speculation because they presentthings more or less as certain (see also(Thompson et al, 2008)).
In this view, the caseof ?indicate that?
is interesting to be detailed.Whereas many studies use it as a linguisticmarker of speculation, Kilicoglu and Bergler(2008) recently moderated its speculativemeaning by highlighting the additional need totake into account its context.
The linguisticanalysis used to establish the rules in BioEx-com is much more restrictive and does notconsider it as a marker.It should also be mentioned that we noticed afew sentences which were incorrectly anno-tated in BioScope as speculation.
Thus, thesentence (11) is rather, in our opinion, a defi-nite statement (?or?
can be replaced by ?and?).
(11) Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluIfragment, when fused to thechloramphenicol acetyltransferasegene driven by the conalbuminpromoter, stimulated transcription inB cells but not in Jurkat T cells orHeLa cells.There are also some sentences annotated inBioscope which are undoubtedly speculationsbut they were not identified by BioExcom.Thus, BioExcom has not annotated some spe-culative sentences because of the lack of someaccurate markers into its linguistic resources.This is the case in the sentence (12): ?seems?
isrecognized by BioExcom only when it is asso-ciated with some adjectives (?seems probable?for example).
We can also cite the more ambi-guous case of ?predicted?
(sentence (13))which is also absent from the linguistic re-sources of BioExcom.
Although a predictioncan be considered as having a more particularstatus because it presents a low degree of un-certainty, we can consider that it should betaken into account because the predicted pro-posal remains hypothetical.37Figure 3: Results of the annotation of BioScope by BioExcom and of the manual checking (the calculations arebased on BioExcom segmentation).
Spe = speculative segment; no Spe = non speculative segment.
(12) A transcription factor, NF-AT, whichis essential for early T-cell geneactivation, seems to be a specifictarget of cyclosporin A and FK506action because transcription directedby this protein is blocked in T cellstreated with these drugs, with little orno effect on other transcription factorssuch as AP-1 and NF-kappa B.
(13) Expression of full-length and mutantcDNA clones in bacteria reveal thatthe single HMG motif, which ispredicted to contain two extendedalpha-helical segments, is sufficient todirect the sequence-specific binding ofTCF-1 alpha to DNA.Beside the lack of accurate markers, the ab-sence of specific markers in some sentencesdoes not allow the detection of some specula-tions by BioExcom.
For example, in BioEx-com, the ambiguity of the indicator ?could?
(past form or conditional form) is lifted by thepresence of some positive clues expressingconditionality or possibility, such as ?if?
or?whether?.
But in the sentence (14), ?could?has no clues to be disambiguated and althoughit is a speculation, BioExcom did not annotateit.
(14) This method could be quite useful todetect not only CAG repeats in SBMAbut also other polymorphicdinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.The second group consists of segments anno-tated by BioExcom and not in BioScope(119 segments, see Figure 2).
Around 80% ofthese sentences appeared to be speculative af-ter manual examination.
As an illustration, thefollowing sentence is clearly a speculation(?We hypothesize that?)
but is not annotated inBioScope.
(15) We hypothesize that a mutation of thehGR glucocorticoid-binding domain isthe cause of cortisol resistance.Finally, based on these results, we decided torecalculate the Precision, Recall and F-Measure to be more in agreement with the no-tion of speculation as it has been described byDescl?s et al (2009) (last lines in Tables 2 and3).
Corrected Precision, Recall and F-Measureare respectively around 99%, 83% and 90%(averages calculated from the total of segmentsof the two corpora).
These results are close tothe first evaluation performed by Descl?s et al(2009), even if Recall is still lower than pre-viously.Obviously, our results are not directly com-parable with the prior studies because BioEx-com does not use exactly the same criteria torecognize the speculative sentences and conse-quently we re-annotated the BioScope corpusaccording to the criteria of BioExcom.
Oneother difference is that the source used for lin-guistic resources and rules of BioExcom iscompletely different from the source of thecorpus used for the evaluation, aside from thestudies using directly BioScope like Moranteand Daelemans (2009) or ?zgur and Radev(2009).
Nevertheless, considering that there area few studies using a part of the BioScope cor-38pus, it can be interesting to mention that Bio-Excom achieves good performances in particu-lar for Precision rate (Table 2 and 3).Precision Recall F-Measure1 Fruit-fly dataset   85,081 BMC dataset   74,932 Fruit-fly dataset 85 86 852 BMC dataset 80 85 823 BioScope 75,35 68,18 71,594 BioScope  90,81 76,17 82,825 BioScope (cor-rected)97,63 77,46 86,39Table 2: Results reported in different publicationsand concerning the recognition of speculations inScientific Full Text Papers, representing a part ofthe BioScope corpus: (1) (Szarvas, 2008), (2) (Kili-coglu and Bergler, 2008), (3) (Morante and Daele-mans, 2009), (5) (?zgur and Radev, 2009), (5)BioExcom in this studyCorpus Precision Recall F-Measure1 BioScope 90,81 79,84 84,772 BioScope  95,56 88,22 91,693 BioScope (cor-rected)99,39 83,93 91,01Table 3: Results reported in different publicationsand concerning the recognition of speculations inScientific Abstracts, representing a part of the Bi-oScope corpus: (1) (Morante and Daelemans, 2009)(2) (?zgur and Radev, 2009), (3) BioExcom in thisstudy6 Conclusion and PerspectivesOur aim was to test on a large scale (the ma-nually annotated BioScope corpus) the rulebased system BioExcom that automaticallyannotates speculations in biomedical papers.We observed an important disagreement be-tween the two annotations and as a result,treated it manually.
We put forward threeprincipal reasons for the differences in annota-tion:?
The lack of certain linguistic markers inBioExcom (false negative): some of them haveto be added in the system (for example ?seem?or ?it appears?).
Some other markers are tooambiguous to be relevant (for example ?could?without a positive clue).?
An error in the annotation of BioExcom or inBioScope (false positives): this is relativelyrare, especially for BioExcom, which favorsthe Precision.?
The difference of criteria used to determinewhether a sentence is speculative or not: this isthe main reason and we discuss it hereafter.Obtaining a good manual annotation is arecurrent problem in semantic annotation(Uren et al, 2006) and some studies have stu-died the disagreement in human judgment (Ve-ronis, 1998).
This phenomenon is undoubtedlyfound here since Szarvas et al (2008) andDescl?s et al (2009) have reported the difficul-ty even for experts to detect speculations.
Butthe disagreement between BioExcom and Bi-oScope has to be seen almost as a conflict con-cerning the meaning given to the word ?specu-lation?
and if we agree on its definition, wedemonstrated the efficiency of BioExcom.Indeed, in order to provide good tools tobiologists, computational linguists seek to ex-tract only definite statements and consequentlytry to remove or to present separately hedging.Some of them have also tried to indicate thedegree of uncertainty, in order to better charac-terize hedging.
Despite the promising use ofweighting of hedging cues (Kilicoglu andBergler, 2008), the task of determining thestrength of speculation appears to be difficult,even for biologists (Light et al, 2004).
Inanother hand biologists can also consider spec-ulation as a source of knowledge (for example,Thompson et al (2008) categorize speculationas a type of knowledge), giving actual trends,new ideas and hypothesis useful for them.
Inthis view, BioExcom extracts them accordingto more restrictive criteria and categorizesthem into ?prior?
and ?new?
in order to betterhighlight speculations.
Knowing the new spec-ulations of a paper can reveal some of the realnew output of it and so help to decide whichpaper is worth spending time.
The categoriza-tion into prior speculation highlights the emer-gence of an idea which is taken into considera-tion by the scientific community and thus canalso, at least partially, give an indication of itsimportance among the huge amount of specu-lations in the literature.The availability of the corpora (raw BioEx-com annotations and re-annotations of BioS-cope according to these criteria) could help tobetter take into account these views.
In particu-lar, these corpora will be useful to improve therules of BioExcom for detecting speculations.And many of the other sentences belonging tohedging and discarded during the re-annotationprocess (previously annotated or not in BioS-cope) will serve to develop other semantic cat-egories such as demonstration/conclusion ordeduction.39AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank J.P Descl?s and M.Alrahabi for helpful discussions.ReferencesAlrahabi M (2010) EXCOM-2: a platform for au-tomatic annotation of semantic categories: Con-ception, modeling and implementation.
