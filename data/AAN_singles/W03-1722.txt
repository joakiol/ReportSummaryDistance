Chinese Word Segmentation at Peking UniversityDuan Huiming  Bai Xiaojing  Chang Baobao  Yu ShiwenInstitute of Computational Linguistics, Peking University{duenhm, baixj, chbb, yusw}@pku.edu.cnAbstractWord segmentation is the first step in Chineseinformation processing, and the performanceof the segmenter, therefore, has a direct andgreat influence on the processing steps thatfollow.
Different segmenters will givedifferent results when handling issues likeword boundary.
And we will present in thispaper that there is no need for an absolutedefinition of word boundary for all segmenters,and that different results of segmentation shallbe acceptable if they can help to reach acorrect syntactic analysis in the end.Keyword: automatic Chinese wordsegmentation, word segmentation evaluation,corpus, natural language processing1.
IntroductionOn behalf of the Institute of ComputationalLinguistics, Peking University, we would liketo thank ACL-SIGHAN for sponsoring theFirst International Chinese WordSegmentation Bakeoff, which provides us anopportunity to present our achievement of thepast decade.We know for sure that it is very difficult tosettle on a scientific and appropriate methodof evaluation, and it might be even moredifficult than word segmentation itself.
We arealso clear that each step in Chineseinformation processing requires great efforts,and a satisfactory result in word segmentation,though critical, does not necessarily guaranteegood results in the following steps.From the test results of this evaluation, weare very gratified to see that we have done agood job both as a test corpus provider and asa participant.
According to the rule, we did nottest on the corpus we provided, but it is quiteencouraging that our supply tops the testcorpus list to be elected by other participants.Section 2 and Section 3 describes our workin the Bakeoff as the test corpus provider andthe participant respectively.2.
The test corpus provider2.1 CorpusThe corpus we provided to the sponsorincludes:?
A training set from People?s Daily(January, 1998)?
A test set from People?s Daily (Page 4 ofJanuary 1, 1998)Data from People?s Daily features standardChinese, little language error, a wide coverageof linguistic phenomenon and topics, whichare required for statistic training.
Meanwhile,the corpus we provided is a latest versionmanually validated, hence a high level ofcorrectness and consistency.2.2 SpecificationWhen processing a corpus, we need a detailedand carefully designed specification forguidance.
And when using the corpus for NLPevaluation, we also need such a specificationto ensure a fair contest for different systemswithin a common framework.We provided the latest version of ourspecification, which has been published in theJournal of Chinese Information Processing.Based on our experience of large-scale corpusprocessing in recent years, the current versiongave us different perspectives in a consistentway, and we hope it will also help others inthis field know better of our segmented andPOS-tagged corpus.3.
The participant3.1 Training and testingOur research on word segmentation has beenfocusing on People?s Daily.
As we are one ofthe two providers of Chinese corpora in GBcode in this Bakeoff, we had to test on thePenn Chinese treebank.Not all the training and test corpus we gotcame from the Mainland China.
Some wereGB data converted from BIG5 texts of Taiwan.It is commonly known that in the Mainland,Hong Kong and Taiwai, the Chinese langaugeis used diversely not only in the sense ofdifferent coding systems, but in respect ofdifferent wordings as well.While training our segmenter, we studiedthe guidelines and training corpus of PennChinese treebank, tracing the differences andworking on them.
The main differencebetween the work of U. Penn and that of oursis notion of ?word?.
For instance:Differences of ?Word?
U. Penn PKUChinese name ???????
?
?
?, ?
?
?Number + ??|????
11.6?????????
11.6?
??????
?
?Monosyllabic verb + complement ????????
?
???
???
?Time word ??????????
??
??????
?
?Noun + suffix ???
?????????
???
?????
?Disyllabic verb + ???
???????
??
????
??
?These are different combinations in regardof words which follow certain patterns, andcan therefore be handled easily by applyingrules to the grogram.
The real difficulty for us,however, is the following items:U. Penn PKU??
??
??????
??
??????
??
??????
??
??????

?The Open Track allows us to use our ownrecourses, so we had to find the lexicalcorrespondence to reduce the negtive effectcaused by the difference between PennChinese treebank and our own corpus.However, as the training corpus is small, wecould not remove all the negative effect, andthe untackled problems remained to affect ourtest result.Further, as we have been working onlanguage data from the Mainland China, thelexicon of our segmenter does not containwords used in Taiwan.
Such being the case,we added into our lexicon the entries that werenot known (i.e., not found in the training set)and could not be handled by the rule-basedmakeshift either.
But because we are not veryfamiliar with the Chinese language used inTaiwan, we could not make a complete patchdue to the limit of time.3.2 Result analysisFrom the test result that the sponsor provided,we can see our segmenter failed to score whenthe notion of ?word?
and the recognition ofunknown words are involved.Example 1:[U. Penn] ??

?The recognition of unknown words has longbeen a bottleneck for word segmentationtechnique.
So far we have not found a goodsolution, but we are confident about a progressin this respect in the near future.4.
ConclusionWord segmentation is the first step yet a keystep in Chinese information processing, butwe have not found a perfect solution up tillnow.
From an engineering perspective, wethink there is no need for a unique result ofsegmentation.
All roads lead to Rome.
Theapproach you take, technical or non-technical,will be a good one if the expected result isachieved.
And it would be more desirable ifthe processing program in each step cantolerate or even correct the errors made in theprevious step.We learn from our experience that thecomputer processing of natural language is acomplex issue, which requires a solidfundamental research (on the language itself)to ensure a higher accuracy of automation.
Itis definitely hard to achieve an increase of onepercent or even less in the accuracy of wordsegmentation, but we are still confident andwill keep working in this respect.Finally, we would like to thank Dr. Li Baoliand Dr. Bing SWEN for their great efforts onthe maintenance of our segmentation program.ReferenceYu, Shiwen, DUAN, Hui-ming, ZHU, Xue-feng,Bing SWEN.
