67INTRODUCTIONS ince  t h e  early days of e l e c t r o n i c  computing, two kinds ofa s s o c i a t i o n s  have existed between computers and d i c t i o n a r i e s  :either the computer uses, for various purposes, a storeddic t ionary  of some sort (lexicon, vocabulary, glossary,thesaurus) or the compuker is employed for constructing andanalyzing a dic t ionary .
The latter a c t i v i t y  was given a s t r o n gimpetus in the late 1950's by the formation o f t h e c e n t r edlEtudes du Vocabulaire Francais and its publ icat ion,  theCahiers de Lexicologie.
Thus lexicography was among the firstncn-mathematical disciplines to make use of the symbolmanipulating capabil ity of computers.While formal theories of syntax have been $uccessful indescribing the  rules of gramnatical accepeability of naturallanguage utterances, the study of meaning, usual ly  c a l l e dsemantics, has not yet produced a theory of the semanticstructure of languages, based on observation and analys i s .
It isbeyond the scope af  t h i s  paper to d i s c u s s ,  even superf ic ia l ly ,the various viewpoints concerned w i t h  the concept of meaning.One of us, V i i l  (19741, has ,  however, compiled a reasonablyexhaustive crit ical  survey of the relevant l i t e ra tu re .For the purposes of this work, it suffi-ces to present thefollowing categories of meaning, as set out by Longyear (19.71)-;1 .
Logical meaning applies to such attempts to deal withmeaning as symbolic log ic  and mathematics.
The meanings withwhich the s i g n a l s  of such systems correlate are uniqueoutside-world referents or unique meanings w i t h i n  the logicalsystem that  eventual ly  have outside-world referents.2.
General-sernant'4c meanings are a l so  uniqne in theirreference to outside world, but the semanticists are lesss t r i n g e n t  i n  scope than the logicians.
Nevertheless, t h e i rscope is an i d e a l i z e d  language, much more l i m i t e d  thanordinary language.3.
Communication-theory meaning is equivalent to t he  amountof information that  can be transmitted per u n i t  time in acomunication .system.4 .
Lexicoqraphical meaning is tha t  of "words, " and theI outside-world reference is what w e  o r d i n a r i l y  c a l l  meaning.
115.
Psycholoqical meaning has so great a scope that  the par&involving ordinary language becomes nearly t r i v i  a1 .
Itencompasses overt or covert behavior of any organism asresponses to s t imul i .6.
Word-mind meaning h$q the scope equivalent to t h a t  ofordinary language.
The "words " here are l i n g u i s t i cstructures, but the "meanings" are ideas ,  mental states, andconceptual c a t e g o r i e s .
To o r d i n a r y  meanings ( i n  t h e  l ex ica ls e n s e )  here co r r e spond  signals by which mental  s t a t e s  area s c e r t a i n e d .7.
L i n q u i s t i c  meaning refers to s i g n a l s  as the p i e c e s  o u tof  which language i s  made, i.e.
m i c r o l i n g u i s  t i c ,p h ~ n o l o g i c a l ,  and s y n t a c t i c  s i g n a l s .In the framework .of o u r  particular topic w e  shall be mainlyconcerned w i t h  categories 4 and 7 .According t o  Weinreich (1 966 ) , u n i l i n g u a l  d e f l n i n gd i c t i o n a r i e s  appear t o  be based on a model that assumes ad i s t i n c t i o n  between meaning p rope r  ( s i g n i f i c a t i o n ,  comprehension,i n t e n s i o n )  and t h e  t h i n g  meant by a s i g n  ( d e n o t a t i o n ,  reference,e x t e n s i o n )  .
On the basis of what is meant by a sign, Osgaod,s u c i ,  and Tannenbaum ( 1  95 7 )  distinguish three k i n d s  of meaning.1.
Pragmatical ( s o c i o l o g i c a l )  meaning : the r e l a t i o n  ofsigns t o  s i t u a t i o n s  and behaviors.2 .
( l i n a u i s  t i c )  meaning : the r e l a t i o n  of s i g n st o  other signs.3.
Semant ica l  meaning: the r e l a t i o n  of signs t o  t h e i rs i g n i f i c a t e s  .
It is  easy to see that these classes are i ncorrespondence with Longyear ' s  three layers i n  category 7.Homing o n t o  o u r  primary t a r g e t ,  w e  may now restrict ourinterests somewhat f u r t h e r  and c o n c e n t r a t e  on t h e  t w o  l a s tclasses of  meaning, known under v a r i o u s  d e s i g n a t i o n s  bu t ,  b y  t h ema jo r i ty  of writers, d i s t i n g u i s h e d  as s t r u c t u r a l  meaning andlexical meaning.Mackey (19653 f i n d s  structural meanings i n  ( 1  ) structurewords, (2 )  i n f l e c t i o n a l  forms,  and (31 types of word o rder .Examples of structure words are articles and prepoai t i o n s ,  andthese, he i n s i s t s ,  a l t hough  o f t e n  called meaningless  o r  empty,may have a large number of  meanings.
S i m i l a r l y ,  the i n f l e c t i o n a lforms, such as t h e  g e n i t i v e  case and p r e s e n t  t e n s e ,  may have anumber of meanings, and so  may some types of word order.
L e x i c a lmefinings, on t h e  o t h e r  hand,  refer t o  the meanings of t h e  c o n t e n twords, i n  which the d i f f e r e n c e s  i n  meaning are most easily seen.I n  R u s s e l l ' s  v i m  (1 967)  the s t r u c t u r e  words, such as " than ,  I&"or, " " h o w e ~ e r , "  have meaning o n l y  in a suitable verbal c o n t e x tand canno t  s t a n d  alone.
The c o n t e n t  words, which he cal ls  objectwords, such as p r o p e r  names, class names of animals, names ofc o l o r s ,  do not presuppose ~ t h e r  words and can be used i ni s o l a t i o n .
Their  meaning is  l e a r n t  by c o n f r o n t a t i o n  with o b j e c t sthat are what they mean or instances of what they  mean.
A s  soonas t h e  a s s o c i a t i o n  between an object word and what it means hasbeen e s t a b l i s h e d  by the  l e a r n e r ' s  h e a r i n g ,  i f  f r e q u e n t l ypronounced i n  the presence  of t h e  o b j e c t ,  t h e  word i s  unders toodalso i n  the absence of the  o b j e c t .

T h i s  fact is c l e a r l ~  seen in thepreparation of the dic t i onary  used for our experiments.SOME; PROBLEhIS OF LEXICAL HELATEDNESS1.
Polysemy and HomonymyWhile the problem of meaning is complex in itself, thedifficulty i n c r e a s e s  by another order of magnitude if one has todeal w i t h  words of many n~eanings or different words withd i f f e r e n t  meanings thak have i d e n t i c a l  s p e l l i n g s  orpronoupc ia t ions .
And the  decision as to whether a given caserepresents one polysemous word or two (or more) homonyms is farfrom being w e l l  de f ined .The separation can be based on morphological criteria .
Firstof all, two graphematical ly  i d e n t i c a l  word forms wi th  differentmeanings are regarded a s  homqraphs and separated i f  they displaya phonematic d i f f e r e n c e  or i f  they belong to different wordclasses.
They are also homographs even if they belong to thesame word class but possess different i n f l e c t i o n  systems.otherwise, they represent  the same word.
More than one meaningof one word const i tutes a case of polysemy.
I n  contrast w i t hsuch d i v e r s i f i e d  meanings of one word, we t a l k  about h m ,  inwhich case two words have by chance acquired the same e x t e r n a lappearance.
A d i s t i n c t i o n  between t he  two can on ly  be made, ifa t  a l l ,  on the basis of the  h i s t o r i c a l  o r i g i n  of the wordsinvo lved.
Direct, t r a n s f e r r e d  and specialized senses  of a wordcan be l i s t e d  along ope dimension of meaning, dominant and basicsenses r e p r e s e n t  certain measures along another  dimension.Another concept is semantic  d e p l e t i o n ,  i n  which case t h e  wordoccurs i n  scores of expres s ions .
Mere, the verbal or  s i t u a t i o n a lcontext - adds substantially t o  the meaning of the word i nquestion.
With polysemy, however, the context  e l i m i n a t e s  thosesenses of the word that do not apply and thereby disambiguatest h e  polysemous word.
It i s ,  therefore, i m p o r t a n t  from t h el e x i c o g r a p h i c a l  p o i n t  of view t o  d i s t i n g u i s h  between the degreesof interaction between the con tex t  and t h e  meaning of ind iv idua l(a) i n  case o f  weak i n ?
luence ,  w e  t a l k  a b o u t  autosemant ic  o rsemantically autonomous words ;(b) a s t r o n g  in f luence  performs a disambiguat ion o fpolysemous o r  homonymous words;(c) t h e  c o n t e x t  d e f i n e s  t h e  'meaning of synsemantic orsemantically deple ted  words.Needless to say t h a t  the above, as innumerable other,dec is ions  must o f t e n  be based on subjective c r i t e r i a .
F i n a l l y ,it could be noted that, i n  e x c e p t i o n a l  cases, even the inmediatec o n t e x t  cannot  r e so lve  t h e  ambiguity4 and two o r  morei n t e r p r e t a t i o n s  are acceptable.
T h i s  phenpenon  is theI t  i s  clear even t o  the casual observer t h a t  t o t a li n t e r c h a n g e a b i l i t y  in all contexts, and identity in bothc o g n i t i v e  and emotive senses, of two lexical units (words, i n  thes i m p l e s t  case] are not possible i n  genera l .
The semant icr e l a t i o n s h i r ;  between synonymy is based on and measured by a l e v e lof  s i m i l a r i t y .Rather than d i s t i n g u i s h i n g  between the "meaning" and the"usage" of a word, one should  assume the v i e w  t h a t  the  former i st h e  sum t o t a l  of t h e  p o s s i b i l i t !
i e s  of the la t te r .
This isb a s i c a l l y  what j u s t i f i e s  the e x i s t e n c e  of any monolingual (and,poss ib ly ,  b i l i n g u a l )  d i c t i o n a r y .The entries i n  the d i c t i o n a r i e s  we are concerned with areboth words (the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  and d e f i n i t i o n  of which units areless than c l e a r - c u t )  and mult i -word l e x i c a l  units.
The two areof the same s t and ing  and function, and they  w i l l  be treatedi d e n t i c a l l y .3.
D e f i n i t i o n sDefinit ion is the most fuhdamental concept  associated withd i c t i o n a r i e s .
We s h a l l  be concerned with both classicalAris to te l ian  definitions, based on "class" and "characteristics",and operat ional  d e f i n i t i o n s  which use sententialw g e n e r a t i v eterms.

OF THE SCIENCE OF DICPIONARY1 .
General, ConceptsU a o u g h  definitions abound, a reasonable d i s t i n c t i o n  seemsto  be to say t h a t  the semantic description of indiv idual  terms,the inventory of words is the customary province of Lexicoqraphywhereas le&coloqy refers to the study o f  the  lexical material,of the recurrent patterns of semantic r e l a t i o n s h i p s ,  and of anyformal devices, such as phonological and granmatical $ystems,that generate the latter.T o  construct  a d ic t ionary  of a given size,.
one could choosethe entries on the basis of t he i r  frequency of occurrence or inrelying on some measure o f  * u t i l i t y  t h a t  is vaguely t i e d  to t h esemantic generality of the candidates.
N o  s o l u t i o n  i s  perfect oreven uniformly useful over the whole dictionary.Even the arrangement of meanings of a given entry is moot.we talk about l o g i c a l ,  historical and empirical orders.
(Thelatter starts with the comon and current usage followed byobsolete, colloquial, provincial, slang and technical meanings.
)We can dif ferenkiate between engyclopedi c andlinguistic dicstionaries.he latter are primarily concerned withthe lexical units  of the language and a l l  their l i n g u i s t i cproperties .
The former, on the other hand, give informationabout sane samponent of the extral ihguis  tic world.
Our workderives its data base from an encyclopedic dict ionary.
It ehouldbe noted t h a t  the highly polysemous nature of the entries in alinguistic dictionary would have constituted an addi t iona 1complication in this pilot project, which has now been avoidedwithout affecting t h e  general validity of the resu Its.We propose t o  int roduce the tern lexicometry to designate the,di sc ip l ine  which investigates and analyzes  the quanti tat iveaspects of dictionaries, t h e  vocabulary of a language and varioussubsets  of the  l a t t e t .
Lexicometry would count, weigh and.
.measure, and express t h e  results in s t a t i s t i c a l  and mathmaticalterms.
Many such studies are widely known.
Such is t he  onereported by G U ~  raud ( 1  959 :The most frequent words are:(a) the  shortest,b the oldes t ,( c )  the morphologically simplest,(d) the semanti-caf l y  most extended,  i .e.g r e a t e s t  number of meanings.possessing t h eAs to the measure of frequency,n the f i r s t  100 words cover 608 of an averagen t e x t ,I# 81 t l  tl M I( Q 1000 85% fto I a I n m n 4000 9705%Thus the remaining X (?)

Wecould say that a frequent word is  most useful  in the aggregate,and a rare word in a particular case.Other studies in glottochronology mhcern thanselves with therate of change i n  Language and i n  basic vocabulary.
Further,distribution of the frequencies of occurrence w i t h  or withoutreference to any particular vocabulary has a l s o  been studied.Finding r e l a t i o n s  of the above kind is not j u s t  an academicexercise to s a t i s f y  the curiosity of a few l i n g u i s t s ,  but theserelationships may have various practical applications.
Forexample, Maas (1972)  asserts that the knowledge of a funct ionalrelation between the length of a t e x t  and the size of  thevocabulary used i n  it would be desirable in order to estimate thee f f o r t  needed f o r  extension of a machine d ic t ionary  or i ncomparison of vocabulary contents  of t e x t s  of d i f  ferent l eng ths .In the latter case, one can standardize or normalize the t e x t sunder i n v e s t i g a t i o n  by reducing them t o  a common minimal lengththrough computational methods and then compare the resultingvocabulary volumes.L e t  V be the number of e lements  (words) i n  a text and N theI -l e n g t h  of the text.
Then we surmise, says Maas, a f u n c t i o n a lrelatiurnship to  exist between N - and V:-Muller (1964) reported a re la t ion  between V and d such that- -the r a t i o  of their logarithms i s  cons tant :lo N-3.- = a,or va = N, or, 10q- v1 if we s e t  - = k, k V = L J ,  aSince the vocabulary of a language, however, is supposed tobe restricted, so argues Maas, the existence of a l i m i t i n g  valueis to be postulated:V,= lim f (N)N+mAs the derivative of f at a given value of N represents the- -relative increase in V -1 it is to be s t a t e d  that f' (N) approaches0 with i n c r e a s i n g  - N,The derivative of a f at the p o i n t  1 is assumed to be 1 becausea tex t  of l e n g t h  1 has a vocabulary consisting of one word, henceTherefore - f' i s  a function that decreases mnotonical ly from 1 toAs a consequence of the above speculations, in t h e  expressionV = N~ k cannot be constant.

Mackey ( 1965 )  s ta tes  thathe coverage or covering capacity of an item is thenumber of t h i n g s  one can say w i t h  it.
It can be measured bythe number of other  items which it can d i s p l a c e .

Words the meanings of which are easily extendedme'kaphorically can be used to eliminate others (e.g.,tributary of a river can be covered by branch or arm).- -3 .
Certain simple words can displace others by combininge i t h e r  together or with simple word endings (em g. , news +paper + man = journa l i s t  ; hand + book = manual) .4 .
Certain words can be replaced by simple d e f i n i t i o n( e r g .
,  breakfast can be def ined as morning meal; pony a ssmall horse ) .As an example of the app l i ca t ion  of the above principle, inthe derivation of Basic English (by definition), the  language wasf irs t  reduced to 7500 words, and, by r e d e f i n i t i o n ,  cut down to1500.
These were further reduced to  the  eventual  850 by atechnique of "panoptic" d e f i n i t i o n  (eliminate each word on t h egrounds that it is some sort of modification of other  words, e. g.a modif icat ion i n  time, numbe-r, or s i z e )  .Basic English, which was founded essentially on the p r i n c i p l eof cove rage, was a conscious reaction a g a i n s t  theover-application of the p r i n c i p l e  of frequency i n  selection.
ForOgden (1  933) , it was n o t  the frequency of a word which makes i tu s e f u l ,  it  was i ts  usefulness which makes it frequent.In the following part  of this sect ion,  we attempt to presentsome of the salierit p o i n t s  of Savard (1 970).The vocabulary i n d i c e s  most widely known today are those o ffrequency, of distribution, and of a v a i l a b i l i t y .
But these aren o t  s u f f i c i e n t  to select words for a restricted vocabulary forthe purpose of teaching a fore ign  language, such as Wench, tobeginners.An objective c r i t e r i o n  is l e x i c a l  valence .

It is Mackey's coveraqe t h a t  herenders as  valence,Like  Mackey ( 1 9 6 5 ) ,  he maintains t h a t  the s u b s t i t u t i o n  of oneword for another can he made by virtue of four criteria: ( 1 )d e f i n i t i o n ,  ( 2 )  i n c l u s i o n ,  ( 3 )  combinatiori, ( 4 )  ex t ens ion .~ e f i n i t i o n  has already been discussed previously.Linguists do not  t a l k  specifically about inclusion; rather ,they d e a l  with synonymy or l e x i c a l  paral le l i sm.

- lieu and endroi t .For Savard, the bas i c  criterion t h a t  permits to establish aseries of the p o s s i b i l i t y  of s u b s t i t u t i n g  one termfor  another.One of the s i m p l e s t  amng a l l  the procedures of vocabularyenrichment consists o f  j o in ing  two words order to makecompound words.
The p r i n c i p l e  0-f combination appears as anotherphenomenon common t~ a l l  langrlages.It i s  n o t  necessary that  the number of s imple words beunbounded because almost a l l  verbs have a p o t e n t i a l  ofundetermined sense, and so do the adject ives .
A word is said tohave more or less extension according to wheaer it  can "cover" amore or less great number of f u l l y  or p ~ r t i a l l y  d i f f e r e n tnotions.Polysemy is the exact opposite of synonymy.
Polysemy becomescomplicated d w  to the phenomenon of homonymy.
Polysemy andhomonymy constitute two very r i ch  sources of l ex i ca l  economy.Togethel: they form Savard' s l a s t  criterion of lexicalvalence--the semantic extension,Although the valence i t se l f  has rfever been mathematicallymeasured and although there exis- no sc i en t i f i c  means of showingits existence, it has neverthe less, been proven that four formalproceaures of lexical economy permt to replace certain words byother words, and that  is what S a v ~ d  cal ls  l e x i c a l  valence.The postulated existence hypothesis of lexical valence leadsto the c a l c u l a t i o n  of a global index of valence for e k d r y  word.To evaluate t h e  power of of  a word, one i n s p e c t s ,in t h e  dictionary,  each element of the general 139t and countshow many times a word enters  into  the definition of another.To measure the power of combination of a lexical unit, oneinspects in the d i c t i o n a r y  all the compound words joined by ahyphen, all the Gallicisms ( i n  English, these would beAnglicisms) and, in general, a l l  the  word groups.W i t h  a view of appra i s ing  the power of i n c l u s i o n ,  oneinspects me units of the general l i s t  in two synonymdictionaries and takes the higher  number.
The numbei of synonymstha t  possess a word c o n s t i t u t e s  a measure of the nunber of wordsf o r  which can substituted.To measure the power of semant id  e x t e n s i o n ,  one i n s p e c t s  eachof the e lements  of the general list i n  the d i c t i o n a r y  and c o u n t sthe number of meanings g iven  by the author t o  such a word in thelist.
T h e  number of meanings of a word is c o n s i d e r e d  as am a s u r e  of i t s  power of semant ic  extension.The global index  of lexical valence is t h e  sum of t h e  fournormalized coun t s .
The two c r i t e d i a  having  t h e  h ighes tc o r r e l a t i o n  are d e f i n i t i o n  and combinat ion.In the beginning of t h e  study, it was assumed t h a t  thk fourv a r i a b l e s  were entirely independent  of each other .
The resultsof a f a c t o ~ a n a l y s i s  i n d i c a t e  that they are not  comple te ly  so.
Afactor r o t a t i o n  shows, however , that the  variables ares u f f i c i e n t l y  independent  t o  make it necessary t o  retain the fourcr i t e r i a  of l ex i ca l  valence.A comparison of t h e  rank of the first 40 c o n t e n t  words on thevalence scale w i t h  the same words on t h e  f requency l i s t  allows t oframe a hypothesis t h a t  t h e  c o r r e l a t i o n  between va l ence  andf requency would be rather weak.

Cons t ruc t ion  of the Data BaseThe data base was not  derived from a text but was based on anexisting d i c t i o n a r y  of computer terminology, Chandor ( 1 9 7 0 )  .
Aderivation from a text, if used, should be automatic and woulclconstitute a large-scale programming project in i t s  own rigslt:In creating the data base, it was attempted to keep its structuresimple and uniform without sacrificing its g e n e r a l  validity.
I tw a s  t r i e d  t o  avoid problems that would introduce d i s t r a c t i n gcomplications, from both theoretical and practical noint of view,into the subsgquent operations.
All t h i s  led to t h e  selection- 30 -and construction p r i n c i p l e s  outlined below.Terms  w i t h  excessively long definitions were avoided, i.e.d e f i n i t i o n s  were held reasonably  short .
It was found thatlexical unitslimiting bhe maximum d e f i n i t i o n  l e n g t h  to 22,,did not undu lv  dres tx ic t  t h e  selection.
I n  some cases too long d e f i n i t i o n s  wereshortened by leaving out redundant words ,  glo lses ,  r nxplanatorvnotes.Every element of the c o v e r e d  set was considered a lexicalitem, regardless of whether t h e  oriqinal d i c t i o n a r y  entryconsisted o fa one, two, or more vrords.
For programingconvenience every word was coded as a s t r i n g  of no more than  10symbols.
Thus accumulator was represented as ACUMULATOR,absolute address appeared as ABSADDMSS, andabsolute value computer as ABSIrALCOnIP.Polvsemous terms were avoided.
1f such a term was used,  o n l vi t s  dominan t  meaning was recorded.
In the data-base d i c t i o n a r y ,t h e n ,  each entry (element of t h r  covered set) has only onemeaning and one definition.Tefms  used in the definitions (elements of theacopering set)were a l s o  c o n s i d e r e d  t% be l e x i c a l  items, i.e.
oriqi nalmultiword terms appear as a s i n g l e  element, and every element isrepresented as a s t r i n g  of no more than 1q  symbols.All terms o c c u r r i n g  in t h e  d e f i n i t i o n s  are themselvesd e f i n e d ,  i.e.
each element of th,e covering set appears a lso  int h e  covered set.
This p r i n c i p l e  implies t\at there i s  a S e t  ofwords each element  of  which  is d e f i n e d  by itself.
Such a sat maybe called the basic vocabulary ,  consisting of vrords the meaningso f  which t h e  user of the d i c t i o n a r y  i s  suprmsed t o  know i n  ordert o  use t h e  d i c t i ~ n a ~ z y .
As in this particular case, thed i c t i o n a r y  is one of computer terms and t h e  hasic voca5nlarycontains t h e  non techn ica l  words used  in the d e f i n i t i o n s  of thet e c h n i c a l  terms.I n  t h e  de f in i t ' i ons ,  a d e f i n i t e  d i s t i n c t i o n  was made Sctweenc o n t e n t  words and f u n c t i o n  words, also called opera tors .

I f  this had n o t  been  done, t h e  s i t u a t i o n  would havebeen aggravated by an order of magni tude.
To e l i m i n a t e ,  or  a tleast to alleviate t h i s  b ias ,  a 'Eons ide rah ly  larger data baseshould be used, which, as explained before, would have heenbeyond t h e  scow - of this p i l o t  project.Another, and more important, factor t h a t  c o n t r i b u t e s  t o  t h eproblem in quest ion is the fact t h a t  o u r  data-hase d i c t i ona ry  wasn o t  derived from a t e x t  h u t  c o n s t r u c t e d  from another d i c t i o n a r y .This was done, as described ea r l i e r ,  by selecting entriess t a r t i n g  from t h e  beginning of t h e  dictionary and stopping whenthe data base was of satisfactory size.
As a r e s u l t ,  while  t h ebasic  vocabulary may be assumed to be uniformly distributed overt h e  d i c t i o n a r y ,  the important conten t  words, w i t h  lonqerd e f i n i t i o n s ,  are no t .
The s e l e c t i o n  of e n t r i e s ,  i n  fact, wasstopped a t  t h e  l e t t e r  H.  Words beyond t h a t  p o i n t  are there  onlybecause t h e y  happened t o  occu r  i n  definitions.
Thus,  at leastt h e  words t h a t  o c c u r  on ly  i n  t h e  covered s e t  (and n o t  i n  t h ecover ing  set) are  crowded toward t h e  b e g i n n i n g  of t h e  d i c t i o n a r y .What happened when t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  was reduced i s  now obvious .The weighty words w i t h  long d e f i n i t i o n s  were e l i m i n a t e d  h u t  t h eentire basic v o c a b u l a r y  remained.
This, of course, is q u i t eappropriate and consistent w i t h  our p r i n c i p l e s .
I f ,  f o r  example,the d i c t i a n a r y  had been reduced t o  N = 1 ,  v i r t u a l l y  o n l y  theb a s i c  vocabulary would have been retained, and we shou ld  haveobtained tho postulated linear one-to-one r e l a t i o n s h i p  between vF-and v  3' Nevertheless, t h i s  procedure  enhances t h e  p r o p o r t i o n  oft h e  b a s i c  vocabulary, and t h e  bias i n c r e a s e s .

T h i s  accounts for t h 5i n c r e a s i n g  increment ratio.
The last increment  w i t h  ?J = 1 6  musthave consisted entirely of basic words, t h e r e f o r e  the r a t i o  ofu n i t y .It is suggested t h a t ,  for further i n v e s t i q a t i o n ,  a morecomplicated d i c t i o n a r y - r e d u c t i o n  program be.

Thus a b a s i c  wosd would occur i n  t h e  dictionary onlv  -i f  it i s  needed.in a d e f i n i t i o n ,  which was t h e  case i n  theunreduced d i c t i o n a r y  This :?av .I a more n a t u r a l  p ropor t io r .

Only ahout one f i f t h  of t h e  m a t e r i a lcould be accomfnodated a t  one time without exhausting t h eavailable space.
Therefore  t h e  dictionary was s p l i t  i n t o  f i v ei n d i v i d u a l  List s k r u c t u r e s ,  and t h e  correspofidbng card imaqeswere stored on disk as f i v e  s e p a r a t e  f - i l e s .
These were broughti n ,  one a t  a t ime,  f o r  p rocess ing  ss needed.
Recause of spacel i m i t a t i o n s ,  also processed data and i n t e r m e d i a t e  r e s u l t s  had t o"Ibe p u t  i n  e x t e r n a l  s t o r a g e  dur ing  run  t i n e  and,  of course ,between runs, t h e r e f o r e  more f i l e s  had t o  he created as de.

Thus, a g r e a t  d e a l  of programming effort went into f i l emanipulat ion.The purpose of  t h e  first program, des igna ted  AMALEX, wassimply t o  d i s p l a y  t he  dictionary.
I t  Y i r s t  reads t h e  functionwords from the cards and stores them i n  the form of a 121x2array.
(The width of the array  is 2 because many function wordsare longer  than 10 c h a r a e t e r s .
)Using a f u n c t i o n  READLS, the program reads t h e  dictionary ands tores  15: in t h e  form of a l i s t  structure as described above.
Ont h i s  occasion, it also measures t h e  space r e q u i r e d  for  thedic t ionary .
I t  was found that a field length of more t han235,680, locations ~ m u l d  he needed to accommodate the entire database.A subroutine ca l l ed  RITELS prints out the d ic t i ona ry ,spec i fy ing  each ent ry  by the d e f i n i t i o n  in the form of at most 10words to the l i n e .
The rou t ine  also checks t h e  operator codenumbers in the third'-level sublists and replaces these in t3ep r i n t o u t  by the appropriate f u n c t i o n  tmrds from the array.The d i c t i ona ry  was pr in ted  out in f o u r  separate rvns as t h ed i c t i o n a r y  was initially divided i n t o  fou r  l i s t s .
Since theANALEX program does no f u r t h e r  processing and accumulates no newl ists,  no storage problems arose.
It was no t  until later t h a t  itwas established that a d i v i s i o n  into five p a r t s  was necessary t operform subsequent opera t ions  i n  t h e  space - avai lable .The  first p r i n t o u t s  were carefully examined for  punchingerrors and omissions.
Detected errors ware corrected and thef i l e s  were updated accordingly.The actuaI working program is named COVSET.
If the entiredata base were one  single l i s t  and if time were ava i lab leindefinitelv, A t h i s  pro-gram would do the complete work in a singler u n .
In t h i s  case, i t  would print a fable of corresponding vand % v a l u e s  for a g iven  v a l u e  of N ,  would r educe  the v a l u e  ofI-N and p r i n t  o u t  ano the r  table, etch , and repeat t h i s  for a l l-desired v a l u e s  of N.-This, of course, could not be done because, i n  the f i r s tp l a c e ,  o n l y  one of the f i v e  parts of t h e  d i c t i o n a r y  could h eworked on a t  a t i m e  and, i n  thse second p l a c e ,  the program had tobe run i n  time inc rements  of 600  s or less,  which was the sett i m e  l i m i t ,The p r i n c i p a l  r o u t i n e  i n  COVSET i s  ca- l led  COVRYG, w h i c hcomputes t h e  v a l u e s  of v  f o r  g i v e n  v a l u e s  of v 2 A* Its simpliqiedflow diagram is g i v e n  i n  F r g u ~ e  3.INS-ERT FIGURl2 3 ABOUT HEREw o m ~ o ~ ~ ~ r ~ r ~ o ~ m w m w ~ o ~ ~ - ~ ~ ~ ~ ) I - o m ~ ~ ~ .

T h i s  i s  no longer so in processing the reduced d i c t i o n a r ybecause t h e  words in the definitions of which they occur may havebeen eliminated.
I n  t h e  latter case, t h e r e f o r e ,  this tvpe 0.f aword i s  immediately added t o  b o t h  t h e  Covered List and theCovering L i s t  (it always covers i t se l f )  .I f  t h e  current entry i s  a word that does n o t  occur i n  anyd e f i n i t i o n  (type O ) ,  it is  being encountered t h e  f i r s t t i m e ,  andwe are sure t h a t  it is  not alteady on the Covered- L i s t ;  hence,t h i s  question need not be asked.Otherwise the routine tests if the word is already on t h eCovered List, which may well he t h e  case hecause the word mayhave occurred earlier in the definition of another word.
If so,t h e  routine proceeds to t h e  next ward i n  t'le d i c t i o n a r y .If t h e  word is not found on the Covered L i s t ,  i t  is p u tthere, and KNTCVD is incremented.
Then a l l  the words in thodefinition of the word in quest ion are put on t h e  Wait ing List,which is subsequently processedd This is necessary hecause o ft h e  adopted p r i n c i p k e  t h a t  a l l  t h e  covering :vords nust  t'lemselveqbe covered.

A11 words on the Waiting L i s tcome from definitions and must therefore he added t o  t h e  C o w r i n gL i s t .
After a word has be& processed, it is deleted from t h eWaiting L i s t .~f the c u r r e n t  ptord is n o t  on the Covered List, it mustobvious ly  be p u t  sthere.
F i r s t ,  however, t h e  routine tests  i f  t h eword occurs in t h e  sec t ion  of t h e  d i c t i o n a r v  c u r r e n f l v  i n  s t o r eby checking whether i t s  numerical  v a l u e  is between those of t h ef i r s t  and t h e  l a s t  word of t h e  s e c t i o n .
I f  the word i s  n o tt h e r e ,  t h e  r o u t i n e  postpones i t s  processing and takes t h e  n e x tw o r d  from t h e  Waiting L i s t  because it i s  more econoznical t oprocess f i rs t  a l l  the words available i n  t h e  d i c t i o n a r v  - s e d t i o npresent t han  t o  read i n  o t h e r  sections of the d ic t iona rv  as t h ewords d i c t a t e  it (memory swapping is* cxpensive) .Should t h e  word be i n  t h a t  section, t h e  r o u t i n e  adds it t othe Covered List, increments KNTCVD, and a c t u a l l y  looks for t h ew o r d  i n  the d i c t i o n a r y .
I f  it does nok find it, it gives  ane r r o r  medage ,  p r i n t s  o u t  the questionable word, and terminattbst h e  run .
T h i s  way t'he remaining punching errors in the d a t n  hasew e r e  d e t e c t e d ,  and a ferv words were found missing (due t o  humanerror q u r i n g  t h e  c o n s t r u c t i o n  of t h e  data base when it wasforgotten to e n t e r  words that acutally occured i n  d e f i n i t i o n s )  .The f i l e s  were updated accord ing ly .If t h e  word i s  found, the r o u t i n e  adds a l l  t h e  words i n  i t sd e f i n i t i o n  to t h e  Waiting L i s t ,  t h e n  i n v e s t i g a t e s  i t s  presence onthe Fovering List, and proceeds as described before.
When t h ebottom of the Waiting ~ 1 s t  i s  reached and the l i s t  i s  not empty,t h e  words remaining on it must be i n  other  s e c t i o n s  of t h ed i c t i o n a r y .
The section present is then erased and the nextsect ion i s  brought i n  (if the c u r r e n t  one is sec t ion  5, sect ion 1is read in).
The processing - of t h e  Waiting L i s t  now starts fromt h e  beyinning and continues as described above.If the Waiting List is finally empty, and K?ITCVD equals orexceeds LSTREF, the r o u t i n e  i nc r emen t s  LSTREF by the prescriber?amount, and prints t h e  values of KT!TTCVD and I3VTCTTG.

An error message has been rrovided - for t h ecase i n  which it does n o t  f i n d  t h e  reference for some re~son.FortUnately,  t h e  program never made use of t h i s  message.
Afterfinding the reference, t h e  r o u t i n e  takes the n e x t  v~ord from t h ed i c t i o n a r y  and proceeds as alread descr ibed .When the r o u t i n e  reaches t h e  bottom of t h e  d i c t i ona ry ,  itt e s t s  if it is the last s e c t i o n .
