QUANTIF ICAT IONAL DOMAINS AND RECURSIVECONTEXTSBarbara  Par teeUniversity of MassachusettsDepar tment  of L inguist icsAmhers t ,  MA 01003, USAInternet :  par tee@cs .umass .eduAbst rac tThe implicit delimiting or narrowing of the domainof quantification, e.g., in the case of "unselectivequantifiers" such as the adverbs of quantificationalways, usually, mostly, etc., is a heavily context-dependent phenomenon that has much in commonwith anaphora, presupposition projection, the dy-namics of reference time, reference location, etc.,and other of the context-dependent phenomenadiscussed in Partee (1979).
While many non-linguistic factors clearly play a role in such phe-nomena, there are interesting issues at the inter-section of discourse processing and sentence gram-mar, since in addition to context as constructedat the discourse level, there are subsentential " o-cal contexts" which have limited lifespans and areconstrained by aspects of sentence grammar, bothsyntactic and semantic.So for example in the case of anaphora, whilea pronoun can get its value from an entirelynon-linguistic ontext, if the value of a pronounis determined by a linguistic antecedent, thereare grammatical contraints on the possible struc-tural relations that may hold between antecedentand pronoun, as illustrated by the familiar "pre-cede~command" conditions known since the earlywork of Ross and Langacker and illustrated in (la-b) below with respect to the possibility of inter-preting "some people" as the antecedent of "they".
(la) Some people complain loudly in the mid-dle of the night and they make so much noiseupstairs that one can't sleep.
(lb) They make so much noise upstairs thatone can't sleep and some people complainloudly in the middle of the night.In examples (2a-b) we see a similar restrictionon the possibility of restricting the domain of thequantifier usually by means of material accessiblein the linguistic context: and the relevant notionof accessibility turns out to be the same for thewide range of phenomena mentioned above.
(2a) Henrik likes to travel.
He goes to Francein the summer and he usually travels by car.He goes to England for the spring holidaysand he usually travels by ferry.
(2b) Henrik likes to travel.
He usually trav-els by ear and he goes to France in the sum-mer.
He usually travels by ferry and he goesto England for the spring holidays.In the discourse (2b), unlike that in (2a), itis impossible to understand the domain of thequantifier usually to be limited to the trips toFrance and the trips to England on its two occur-rences, so the discourse nds up sounding contra-dictory.
This constraint on "backwards domainrestriction" is analogous to constraints on back-wards anaphora.Similar constraints apply to the local satisfac-tion of presuppositions by virtue of material thathas its source in the local linguistic context.
AndHeim has shown in her work on the presupposi-tion projection problem that the relevant acces-sibility constraints are fundamentally semantic innature, as can be seen from examples with propo-sitional attitude verbs (which will be reviewed inthe lecture) where examples with identical syn-tactic structure behave differently because of dif-ferent presuppositional relationships among e.g.,"belief worlds" and "hope worlds".
Of course inmany cases the semantic and syntactic structuresare sufficiently parallel that the constraints can of-ten be described either way.The notions of topic and focus appear to beamong the important linguistic notions that playa role in structuring these "recursive contexts"; re-cent work by Rooth and unpublished work by VonFintel makes progress in relating focus structure toanaphoric structure more generally.As Kempson has demonstrated, the samebroad range of inferential processes that play arole in discourse anaphoric phenomena (e.g., in li-censing the use of a definite article) also play a rolein the corresponding phenomena when they show224up in local subsentential contexts; so the fact thataspects of sentence grammar play a crucial rolein defining accessibility relations for "antecedent"material in this whole family of phenomena doesnot mean that the phenomena themselves are tobe described in sentence-grammar terms.
One ofthe interesting issues, then, is the characterizationof the nature of the interface between the gram-matical and the extragrammatical mechanisms in-volved.
Work by Sidner and Webber representsone early line of attack on related problems, andrecent developments in dynamic semantics are an-other.
This lecture will focus more on articulatingthe relationships among the different phenomenathat appear to operate under common "accessi-bility" constraints than on choosing a particularformal approach to treating them.225
