Two Parsing Algorithms by Means of Finite State TransducersEmmaimel  Re  che*Mitsubishi Electric Kesearch I,aboratories201, Broadway, (htmbridge, M A 021:/9, roche((0nierl.conlAbst rac tWe present a new apl)roach , ilhlstrated by two algo-rithms> for parsing not only Finite SI.ate (:Iranlnlarsbut also Context Free Grainlnars and their extension,by means of finite state machines.
'/'he basis is the com-putation of a flxed point of a linite-state function, i.e.a finite-state transducer.
Using these techniques, wehave built a program that parses French sentences witha gramnlar of more than 200>000 lexical rules with atypical response time of less than a second.
The tirst al-gorithm computes a fixed point of a non-deterluinistictinite-state transducer and the second coniplites a lixedpoint of a deterministic bidirectiollal device called abimachine.
These  two algoril;hms point out a new con-nection between the theory of parsing and the theoryof representation of rational transduetions.INTRODUCTIONFhlite state devices have recently attracted a hit ofinterest in computational inguistics.
Couiputationalellieioncy has been drastically improved for n)orpho-logical analysis by representing large dictionaries withFinite State Automata (FSA) and by representhig two-level rnles and le?ical hlforination with finite-statetransducers \[8, 4\] More recently, \[11\] has achieved pars-ing with low level lexical sensitivity by nleans of linitestate automata.
Finite state apl)roximation of co~,text-free grammars also proved both useful and efficient forcertain application \[9\].One COlYimon rnotiwttion of all this work is to inl-prove efficiency dranlatically, hoth hi tel'illS of ti nle andsl)a, ee.
These results often provide l)rOgl'anls orders ofmagnitude faster than more traditional hnplenienta-lions.
Moreover, F~As are a natural way I.o expresslexieal sensitivity, which has always lieell a reqlih'enientin lnorphology and which has proved crucial in syll-tax.
The granllllar we used for French: called Lexh:on-Grammar (set, \[61 \[7\] \[2\] \[3\] \[i01 for insta,,cc), pushesthe lexiealization very far and it is our I)elief that thislexicalization trend will alnplify itself and that it willrestllt i,l grammars everal orders of magnitnde largerthan today's representations.
This nncovers the needfor new methods that will be able to handle such largescale grammars,*Supported by a DRI'\]T-EcoIe l%lytechnique contract,this work w;Ls done at the \]nstitut (~;tSl)~u'd Monge and ~ttthe LADL.Ilowever, a tnahl drawback of the lit;ire st,ate ap-proach to syntax is the dil l lcnlty of representing hier-archical data; this partly explains why l'~SA-based pro-gralllS ollly do illcnllll)lete parsillg.

\[I\].431The parser  in te rm of  rat ionalt ransduct lonIn our parser, the grammar is a rational transdncti0nf, represented by a transducer T. The inl}ut of theparser is the set so containing as only element he in-put sentence bounded by the phrase marker \[P\], i.e.so = {\[P\] sentence \[P\]}.
The analysis consists in com-puting sl = f(so), s2 = f ( s t )  until a tixed point isreached, i.e.
s t , = f(sp).
The set s v contains treesrepresented by bracketed strings, this set is the set ofgrammatical analysis of the sentence, it contains morethan one element in the case of syntactically ambigu-ous inputs.
Each set sl is represented by a DirectedAcyclic Graph (DA(1) Ai, thus the computation con-sists in applying the transducer 7' on the DAGs eli.We shall write it Ai+l = T(Ai ) .In the next section we give two complete xamplesof that.TWO S IMPLE  EXAMPLESAn example  of  a Top-Down ana lys i sThe graph on figure l describes the analysis of thesentence  :sl = John said that Mary leftThe graph on this figure has to be read in the fol-lowing way: the inpnt sentence is represented by theDAG Aton the upper left corner; the subset of thegrammar required for the analysis of this sentence isthe transducer fon  the right hand side of the figure 1.The analysis is then computed in the following way:we apply the transducer f to  Al, that is we computeA2 = f (A l )  , this represents one step of a Top-Downanalysis of the sentence.
The box with a star insiderepresents this operation, namely applying a trans-ducer to a DA(I.
If we then apply f to  this result (i.e.A Q, we obtain Aa=f(A2)= f~(A l )  represented underA2.
If this operation is applied once more, one getsA4=f(Aa)= fa(A1).
This last result, A4, is a fixedpoint of the transducer f, i.e.
f (A4)=A4.
A4 is a DAGthat represents a finite set ?
'et(A4) of strings, llere,this set only contains one elmnent, namely ?
'et(A4) ={ ( J ohn ) N O( said) V O( t hat ( M a,'y) N O( le f t. ) V O )That,~'} .Each element is a bracketed rel)resental.ion of an anal-ysis.
I\]ere the analysis is unique.An  example  of  a s imul taneous  Top-DownBot tom-Up ana lys i sThe previous example might give the iml)ression thatcoml)uting a fixed l)oint of a transducer atttomaticallyleads to simulating a top-down context free analysis.However, we shall now see that using the tlexibility ofmanipulating transducers, namely being able to com-pute the composition and the union of two transducers,allows a context sensitive parsing which is simultane-ously Top-Down and Bottom-up with the possibility ofchoosing which kind of rule should be parsed Bottom-Up,SUl}l)ose one wants to analyze the sentences2 =Max bought a little bit more than five hundred.share certificates.

The second approach is totry using a different representation f T or to apply itdifferently.
In this section, we shall give an algorithmillustrating this second al~l~roaeh.
The basic idea is totransform tile finite-state transducer into a determin-istic device called bimaehine \[1\].
We will detail thatlatter but, basically, a bimaehine stands for a left se-quential fimetion (i.e deterministic from left to righQcomposed to a right sequential function (i.e.
determin-istic from right to left).
Such a decomposition alwaysexists.The interest of this concept appears when onelooks at how tile algorithm ApplyTransdueer performs.In fact the output DAG of this algorithm has a lotof states that lead to nothing, i.e.
states that arenot eoaceessible, thus tile PR, UNE function (called onlive 14 of the ApplyTransducer function) has to re-move most of the states (around 90% in our parser ofFrench).Let us for instance consider tile following example:SUl)l)ose the transducer 7; is tile one represented lig-ure 2 and that we want to compute 7:,(A) where A isthe DAG giwm \[igure 2.a'b c:d .d C :  e e:l tua c .q% XFigure 2: left: initial transducer; 7-ighl: initial DAGFollowing the algorithm described in ApplyTrans-ducer up to line 14 exelnded provides the I)AG A' oftigure 3.A'1 dA tlFigure 3: left: before pruning; right:after i)runingTile PRUNE flmction has then to remove 3 of tilesix states to give tile DA(-I A" of figure 3A way to avoid the overhead of computing unnec-essary states is to ilrst ~q)ply a left sequential trans-ducer 71,,, (that is a transducer deterministic in termof its input when read from left to right) given fig-tire 4 and then apply a right sequential transducer :1',~(i.e.
deterministic in term of its input when read fromright to left) given figure 4.
We shall call the pairB, = (T,,,, 7'a~) the bimaehine flmctionally equivalentto 7a, i.e.

The gralnmar ofFreueh we lind at our disposal was so large that noueof the awdlable parsers could handle it.Although the inq)lement.ed l)art of the gramnlar isstill inc(mll)\[el.e , it ah'ea(ly describes 2,878 sententialverbs (coming from \[6\]), I.Imt is verl)s tlutt can l.ake asentence as argument, leading to 2(11,722 lexieal rulesS;1,359 intransitiw, w.~rbs \[2\] leading to 3,153 lexicalrules; 2,109 transitive verbs \[3\] leading to 9,785 lexicalrules; 2,920 frozen expression (coming from \[7\]) leadingto 9,342 lexieal rules and 1,213 partly frozen adwwbialsleading to 5,032 lexieal rules.
Thus, t.he grammar de-scribes 10,479 entries aud 229,035 lexieal rnles.
