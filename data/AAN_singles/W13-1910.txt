The Biological expres-sion language (BEL) encodes the data in form of causal relationships, which describe the as-sociation between biological events.
BEL can successfully be applied to large data and sup-port causal reasoning and hypothesis genera-tion.
With the rapid growth of biomedical litera-ture, automated methods are a crucial prereq-uisite for handling and encoding the available knowledge.
The BioNLP shared tasks support the development of such tools and provide a linguistically motivated format for the anno-tation of relations.
On the other hand, BEL statements and the corresponding evidence sentences might be a valuable resource for fu-ture BioNLP shared task training data genera-tion.
In this paper, we briefly introduce BEL and investigate how far BioNLP-shared task an-notations could be converted to BEL state-ments and in such a way directly support  BEL statement generation.
We present the first results of the automatic BEL statement generation and emphasize the need for more training data that captures the underlying bio-logical meaning.
1 Introduction Currently a lot of effort is made to extract infor-mation from scientific articles and encode the relevant parts in machine-readable language.
In order to tackle these tasks, curators must be ex-perts in both biological domain and computa-tional representation of knowledge.
With the introduction of BEL, a new knowledge coding convention was made availa-ble, thus simplifying the curation process and ensuring machine readability1.
BEL was initially designed and used in 2003 by Selventa (operat-ing as Genstruct?
Inc. at the time) to capture relationships between biological entities in scien-tific literature (Slater and Song 2012).
It is flexible enough to store content from multiple knowledge layers and a broad range of analytical and deci-sion-supporting applications.
Knowledge bases encoded in BEL are suitable for querying, inter-preting, reasoning and visualising of networks.
BEL represents scientific findings by capturing causal and correlative relationships in a given context, including information about the biologi-cal system and experimental conditions.
The supporting evidences are captured and linked to the publication references.
It is specifically de-signed to adopt external vocabularies and ontol-ogies, and therefore represents life-science knowledge in language and schema known by the community.
Entities in BEL statements are mapped to widely accepted namespaces, which specify a set of domain entities (e.g., HGNC2, CHEBI 3 ).
Continuous development and com-mercial use in more than 80 life science projects in the last ten years qualify BEL as suitable for displaying causal networks for both humans and computers.
Various networks built in BEL were mainly focusing on disease mechanisms (Schlage                                                 1http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BLD/BEL+Language+Documentation+v1.0+-+Current           2 http://www.genenames.org/ 3 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/80et al 2011) and are used for causal reasoning (Chindelevitch et al 2012, Huang et al 2012 and Selventa 2012).
Since 2012, BEL is also available in the public domain through the OpenBEL consortium.
The OpenBel portal4 de-fines the BEL language standard and provides formatted content and compatible tools for re-search.
The necessary information to develop a BEL knowledge base is currently harvested mainly by manual translation of literature into BEL state-ments.
To support automated extraction of statements by text mining techniques, additional efforts and adaptations of existing text mining platforms are necessary.
The BioNLP community has developed various approaches, which may already support the au-tomated extraction of BEL statements.
To esti-mate how far current tools can generate BEL re-lationships, we focused on the BioNLP shared tasks series5.
The BioNLP-shared tasks specify fine-grained information extraction tasks for bio-logically relevant targets, mainly centred on pro-teins and genes.
In the two previous events, Bio-NLP-ST 2009 and 2011, more than 30 teams par-ticipated with their systems, a number of which are available as open source.
In BioNLP-ST 2013 series, additional training data for pathway curation including chemical entities is available.
The organizers develop a linguistically based event representation and provide annotated train-ing and test data to the participants.
The annotat-ed events in training data can directly be used for comparison with BEL definitions and available BEL statements.
If the conversion of said event annotations to BEL statements (and vice versa) is successful on the semantic level, we have a promising opportunity to support both domains.
Information encoded in the BEL statements in combination with corresponding evidence sen-tences could be used as training data to support further tool development.
2 Related Network Representations For pathway representations there exist two widely adopted machine readable representa-tions: Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)6 (Hucka et al 2003) and Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) (Demir et al 2010).
SBML is an XML-based data exchange                                                 4 http://www.openbel.org/ 5 http://2013.bionlp-st.org/ 6 http://sbml.orgformat that supports a formal mathematical rep-resentation of chemical reactions including kinet-ic parameters.
BioPAX is an RDF/OWL-based standard language enabling integration, ex-change, visualization, and analysis of biological pathway data.
Pathway representations in BioPax were already compared to the BioNLP-ST repre-sentations (Ohta et al (1) 2011) and let to the introduction of the Pathway curation task in 20137.
For this task additional entity types and event types were proposed and resulted in a set of new annotations (Ohta et al (2) 2011).
A comparison between BEL and BioPax can be found at the OpenBEL Portal8.
BioPAX focuses on pathway construction and partly may require more information than available in most publica-tions.
BEL?s design enables the representation of causal relationships across a wide range of mechanistic detail and between the levels of mo-lecular event, cellular process, and organism-scale phenotype.
BEL is designed to represent discrete scientific findings and their relevant con-textual information as qualitative causal relation-ships that can drive knowledge-based analytics.
BEL enables biological interference by applica-tions but furthermore is intended as an intuitive language of discourse for biologists.
In such a way BEL is well aligned to the communications done in publications.
The condensed representa-tion of BEL statements and human as well as machine readability are great advantages of the BEL language.?
3 Overview of basic concepts in BEL BEL defines semantic triples that are stored in structured human readable BEL document files.
A semantic triple is defined as a subject ?
predi-cate ?
object triple, where subject is always a BEL term, object either a BEL term or a BEL statement (recursive nature of BEL) and the predicate one of the BEL relationship types.
A BEL term is composed of a BEL function, a cor-responding entity and a referencing namespace.
The two main classes of BEL terms define abun-dance of an entity (e.g., gene) or a biological process (e.g., disease).
Optionally, statements can be enriched by con-                                                7 https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst2013/tasks/pathway-curation 8 Comparison of BEL V1.0 and BioPAX Level3.pdf   http://www.openbel.org/content/bel-lang-resource-documents81text information annotations like the evidence sentences, tissue type, species or cell line.
Two annotation types are reserved, i.e., ?Citation?
and ?Evidence?.
?Evidence?
should state the exact sentence that holds the statement?s information, where ?Citation?
is the source of this knowledge.
Predefined namespaces cover a variety of bio-logical entities: genes, proteins, chemicals, dis-eases and biological processes.
For a complete definition of BEL we refer to the BEL Language documentation.

Abbreviations: Ns=namespace, Aa=amino acid, Pos=positionIn this work we focus mainly on protein-protein relationships (for simplification ?protein?
refers to the corresponding gene, the RNA intermediate and the gene product itself9).
Protein-protein re-lationships are a main focus of the BioNLP shared tasks and cover core relationships of BEL.
An overview of possible statements is given in Table 1 and shortly described below.
Protein en-tities are represented by BEL terms, consisting of the abundance function, the normalized entity and optionally modifications expressed as addi-tional arguments within the abundance function:  BEL statement: p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(P, S, 21)) Entity: AKT1 Namespace: HGNC Optional modification: pmod(P,S,21)      The used namespace denotes the approved symbol of HUGO Gene Nomenclature Commit-tee10.
An overview of currently used namespaces is given at the OpenBEL portal.
The pmod() function explicitly denotes the modification type (here P=phosphorylation), the 1-letter code for the corresponding amino acid (S=Serin) and the position in the protein sequence.
Other modifica-tions are represented with different codes, e.g., M=methylation or U=ubiquitination.
BEL terms may contain protein activity infor-mation such as kinase or transcription factor ac-tivity or certain functions like complex, degrada-tion, translocation or reaction in addition.Figure 1: Example of enriched BEL Statement     By default (but not mandatory) ?Evidence?

In case of extraction from literature the reference source and the evidence sentences are given.
Alternative evidences may be derived from tables, figures, supplementary material or other knowledge sources.
Optionally, the BEL statements can be annotated with specified in-formation about experimental methods, the bio-logical system in which the facts are represented, or even information in which part of the full text the evidence has been found.
An example of such a BEL statement from a small sample set at the OpenBEL portal11 is shown in Figure 1.
Such detailed information from literature, in combina-tion with the BEL statements, could serve as ide-al source for the generation of training data for text mining purposes to facilitate the develop-ment of future automated extraction algorithms.
4 Analysis of basic concepts in the Bio-NLP shared task annotations In the main BioNLP shared task (GE12) nine event types are defined (cf Table 2).
?Gene ex-pression?, ?Transcription?, ?Protein catabolism?, ?Phosphorylation?
and ?Localization?
are simple events, having one protein as Theme argument.
Event Primary Arg.
Second-ary Arg.
Gene Expression Theme(Protein)  Transcription Theme(Protein)  Protein Catabolism Theme(Protein)  Phosphorylation Theme(Protein) Site  Localization Theme(Protein) AtLoc, ToLoc Binding Theme(Protein)+ Site+ Regulation, Positive Regulation, Nega-tive Regulation Theme(Protein/Event),Cause(Protein/Event) Cause, Site, CSite  Table 2: Event types defined in the BioNLP competitions (adapted from (Kim et al 2012).
A ?+?
sign indicates multiple occurrences allowed.
Events ?Phosphorylation?
and ?Localization?
may have additional secondary arguments, like the phosphorylation site or the localization ar-guments ToLoc and AtLoc.
?Binding?
events can have an arbitrary number of proteins as Themes.
Events ?Positive regulation?, ?Negative regula-                                                11 https://github.com/OpenBEL/openbel-framework-resources/blob/master/knowledge/small_corpus.bel 12 https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/home/genia-event-extraction-geniation?
and ?Regulation?
are Regulation Events and have a primary Theme argument and an optional Cause argument, both being either a protein or an event.
The trigger is always the textual repre-sentation of the entities.
Table 3 depicts an ex-ample annotation for the following sentences13:   S1) E1-4: ?RFLAT-1: a new zinc finger transcription factor that activates RANTES gene expression in T lymphocytes.?
S2) E5-9: ?In this study we hypothesized that the phosphor-ylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.?

The gene/protein entities with the Ids T1, T2, T5, and T6 were already provided.
The task was to detect the events E3, E4, E7, E8 and E9.
5 Syntactic mapping from BioNLP an-notation to BEL statements For mapping of the BEL statements and the out-put of the BioNLP shared tasks systems we com-pared the training data for the GENIA BioNLP task with the BEL statements found in the small corpus at the OpenBEL website.
The BioNLP shared task provides no normalization of the en-tities to namespaces.
Since we are mainly inter-ested in the transformation of the event, we ig-nore the normalization aspect in the conversion process.
For most Shared Task events we could                                                 13 Examples taken from http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/ GENIA/SharedTask/detail.shtml83generate BEL Terms which are summarized with the rule set in Table 4 and Table 5.
Standard translation for all protein Themes is protein abundance p(namespace:entity).
In a later network generation step within the BEL frame-work RNA abundance and gene abundance are added automatically to the network of statements for all protein abundances.
Due to this reason, we only consider RNA or gene abundance if we de-tect strong evidences for those states.
For Gene_expression, the protein abundance is only converted to RNA abundance (r(name-space:entity)) if the trigger word is ?gene expres-sion?.
1.1 GeneExpression(Theme(protein)) ??
p(Ns:protein)  If the GeneExpression trigger word is stemmed to ?express?
1.2 GeneExpression(Theme(protein)) ??
r(Ns:protein)  For all other GeneExpression trigger words.
2 Transcription(Theme(protein) ) ??
r(Ns:entity) 3 Phosphorylation(Theme(protein), <Site>) ??
p(Ns:protein, <pmod(P,Aa, Pos)>) 4 ProteinCatabolism(Theme(protein))??
deg(p(Ns:protein)) 5.1 Localization(Theme(protein)) ??
sec (p(Ns:protein))   If the Localization trigger is stemmed to ?secrete?
5.2 Localization(Theme(protein),AtLoc) ??
surf(p(Ns:protein))  If the Localization trigger is stemmed to ?express?
and If AtLoc is ?cell surface?
or ?surface?
5.3 Localization(Theme(protein),AtLoc, ToLoc) ??
tloc (p(Ns:protein),Ns:AtLoc,Ns:ToLoc)  In BEL statements it is necessary to have AtLoc and ToLoc; for some cases the missing information can be inferred otherwise artificial location information is given.
6 Binding(Theme(protein)+,Site+) ??
com-plex(p(ns:protein),+)  The site information will be ignored.
Table 4: Rule set 1 to map BioNLP annotations to BEL statements.
If the trigger word ?expression?
is used, both RNA and protein expression might be meant by the authors, hence we keep the protein abun-dance in those cases.
Similarly for Transcription, the abundance is changed to RNA abundance.
All complexes are translated to protein abun-dance and chemical names are directly translated into abundance (a(ns:chemical names)).
Protein modification events such as Phosphorylation can be directly converted to BEL terms.
The differentmodification events are translated to a single let-ter code in BEL.
If the position information is given in the site expression it can directly be converted to the amino acid single letter code (Aa) and the position information (Pos).
For the simple events Protein degradation and Binding, the translation is straightforward given their similar representation.
The site information of the Binding event is omitted in the BEL state-ment conversion.
It would only be included if there is an experiment showing that a mutation of the site would lead to a suppression of the com-plex building.
In the case of ?Localization?, depending on the localisation trigger different BEL functions are possible.
Given the localization trigger ?secrete?
the BEL annotation is converted to the secretion (sec) function.
If trigger words ?surface?
or ?cell surface?
are identified, the cellSurface (surf) function is assigned.
For other Atloc and ToLoc triggers the function translocation (tloc) is used.
This function always needs two arguments of location.
If one of the arguments (AtLoc or ToLoc) is missing, a general annotation of MESHCL:?Intracellular Space?
is proposed as unknown intracellular location.
Activity status like gtp(p(protein)), kin (p(protein)), tscript(p(protein)),  cat(p(protein)), phos(p(protein)) are often found in the BEL ex-ample corpus.
This information might be partly inferred through the evidence information.
In the first example sentence from Table 2, RFLAT-1 might be directly translated into tscript (p(RFLAT-1)).
In other cases if a protein phos-phorylates another protein directly, the kin(p(protein)) annotation can be added as well.
However, in most cases the information cannot directly be inferred from the sentences (cf.
Fig-ure 1).
The annotators obviously use their back-ground knowledge to include this information.
In the actual status of the Shared Task to BEL con-version we omitted those functions.
Looking at the rule-set for transferring Shared-Task events to BEL statements, it is observed that for most events (six out of nine) only BEL terms are generated, i.e., only the left or right hand side of a complete statement.
Three rules generate complete BEL statements out of the following events: Regulation, Positive Regula-tion and Negative Regulation.
Analysis of the distribution of Events in Shared-Tasked training set (BioNLP ST 2011) reveals that approximate-ly half of the events are Regulation events and84thus, could lead to a set of complete statements.
In Table 5, we describe the rules which generate complete BEL statements.
7 PositiveRegulation(Theme(Protein/Event),  Cause(Protein/Event)) ??
p(ns:protein)/B(Event) -> p(ns:protein)/B(Event) 8 NegativeRegulation(Theme(Protein/Event), Cause(Protein/Event)) ??
p(ns:protein)/B(Event) -| p(ns:protein)/B(Event) 9 Regulation(Theme(Protein/Event), Cause(Protein/Event)) ??
p(ns:protein)/B(Event) -- p(ns:protein)/B(Event)  Table 5: Rule set 2 to map BioNLP annotations to BEL statements.
For all ?Regulation?
events the Theme is trans-lated to the object of the BEL statement and might be a protein or another BEL statement       (B(Event)).
The Cause is integrated as subject within the statement and can be a protein or a statement.
All ?Positive Regulation?
events in the Shared Task annotations are converted to ?in-crease?
statements of BEL.
We do not differenti-ate between ?increase?
and ?directly increase?
in the conversion process.
Similarly, all ?Negative Regulation?
events are converted to a ?decrease?
statement ignoring ?directly decrease?.
In the BEL annotations those two statement groups are the most frequent statements in both corpora.
In the Shared Tasks relations we have the additional relation Regulation.
There is no directly corre-sponding BEL relation for a general regulation event, since it restricts the impact for causal rea-soning.
The event which has the most similar meaning is the statement ?association?.
It is used for associations of proteins but also for associa-tions of proteins and diseases when no further information is available in the text.
The addition-al annotations Site and CSite are currently ig-nored since there is no structure in BEL to in-clude this information directly.
In all three regulation events the Cause is an optional argument and might be missing.
Out of the 7574 regulation events 2152 events contain a cause and thus can be converted to a complete BEL statements.
For all other events the left hand side of the statement is missing.
For obtaining an overview of the conversion process we converted the event annotations from the GENIA training corpus to BEL statements (all relations containing a speculation or a nega-tion were omitted).
The automatically generated BEL documents were checked for syntactical errors with the OpenBEL framework parser andvalidator.
Several adaptations were necessary in the automatic conversion process to generate syntactically correct BEL statements.
Since we have no namespaces available we designed an artificial namespace to generate cor-rect statements.
Furthermore incomplete state-ments with missing subjects (Causes) were not accepted by the BEL framework.
An example of such an incomplete BEL statement is the follow-ing (converted form the shared task annotation depicted in Figure 2):  -| p(BioNLP:STAT4) -| p(BioNLP:IL10)  For all missing Causes we included an artifi-cial Cause resulting in the following statement for the given example:  p(BioNLP:FIXME)-| p(BioNLP:STAT4) -| p(BioNLP:IL10)Figure 2: An example sentence from BioNLP-ST 2011 GE train corpus, visualized using brat.
14  Overall 5333 BEL statements were generated resulting in 588 full statements, 3057 incomplete statements (where the CAUSE is missing and FIXME was introduced) and 1688 BEL terms without any relation.
Remaining syntactic errors were caused through BEL statements containing more than two relations (118 statements), which could not be handled by the BEL framework.
A first version of the converted corpus is available under: http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/ge2011-to-bel.html.
6 Preliminary comparison of converted statements with BEL knowledge re-sources In the BioNLP shared tasks all possible events that fulfill the guidelines are annotated.
In real life use-cases irrelevant or unproven interactions are omitted and biological experts extract BEL statements when they are in focus of their inter-est.
Furthermore experimental evidence for the relation should be should be given in the text.
14 http://brat.nlplab.org85In addition biologists are able to do a semantic interpretation of the experimental results and generate inferred statements.
To find solutions for semantic interpretation for a number of in-complete statements in the direct conversion for the BioNLP-ST annotations we compared sen-tences such as annotated in figure 2 with evi-dence sentences in the BEL sample set.
In the following examples we show how an expert cu-rator conversely infers BEL statements by inter-preting experiment readouts.
Example 1: Evidence = "PI 3- kinase/PKC?, but not PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, is inhibited in IRS-2-deficient brown adipocytes upon insulin stimulation"  p(HGNC:IRS2)-> kinase(p(HGNC:PRKCZ)) p(HGNC:IRS2) causesNoChange kin(p(HGNC:AKT1))  Example  2:  Evidence = "transient transfection of primary brown adipo-cytes with a dominant negative form of p21 Ras completely abolished insulin-induced UCP-1-CAT transactivation."
p(PFH:"RAS Family") -> (p(HGNC:INS) -> r(HGNC:UCP1))  Example  3:  Evidence = "We next examined the Akt T-loop Thr308 phosphorylation in wild-type and SIN1?/?
cells.
We found that Thr308 phosphorylation was completely abolished in the SIN1?/?
cells.?
p(MGI:Mapkap1) -> p(MGI:Akt1,pmod(P,T,308))      The examples given above demonstrate a standard experimental setting.
In most cases the functionality of a gene is abolished and the effect (e.g.
increase, decrease or no effect) on the cor-responding interaction targets is observed.
Some-times, observed effects are compared to cell sys-tems where the normal form (wild type or con-trol) is transfected as well (cf.
Example 3).
All examples share the readout: The BEL statement is not describing the experiment (given in the sentence), but the observed implication inferred from the experiment (cf.
Example 2).
Instead of encoding that a dysfunctional p21 RAS leads to an abolishment of insulin induced UCP1 transactivation, the final BEL statement represents the resulting implication, i.e.
wild-type p21 RAS increases INS, which subsequent-ly increases UCP1:   p(PFH:"RAS Family") -> (p(HGNC:INS) -> r(HGNC:UCP1))Similarly, in Example 3 from the abolishment of a function, the converse argument is derived, i.e.
Mapkap 1 increases the phosphorylation of Akt1 at T308.
This example shows another main issue in deriving BEL statements: two or more sen-tences are needed to get alinformation neces-sary to create a valid BEL statement.
Human cu-rators use multiple sentences as evidence and do additional interpretation of the provided infor-mation.
In Example 3, the AKT phosphorylation is given in the first sentence and the phosphory-lation event is given in the following sentence only in referring to the site and not to the protein.
BioNLP-ST already includes annotation span-ning several sentences but interpretation and merging of those annotations is not trivial.
To complete such statements two different relations have to be combined and that is true for many modification relations.
Especially in the case of phosphorylation, which is a regular activating signal in kinase pathways, we need solutions in-cluding information from different sentences.
The BEL corpus has a high number of phosphor-ylation events and can serve as a base for the generation of further training data.
Another commonly observed experiment uses luciferase and CAT vectors.
Those systems are used to analyze transcriptional activity of pro-moters in dependence of stimuli.
The result of such an experiment is oftentimes given only as a relation to CAT or luciferase like in the follow-ing example:  Example  4:  Evidence = "introduction of miR-145, but not miR-143, with the luciferase vector in Cos cells resulted in relief of the repression and an ~150-fold increase in luciferase activi-ty compared to the CMV-luciferase- Myocd 3' UTR-luciferase vector alone.?
miR(HGNC:MIR145) -> p(HGNC:MYOCD) miR(HGNC:MIR143) causesNoChange p(HGNC:MYOCD)     BioNLP shared task annotation would capture positive regulation of luciferase activity with the cause miR-145.
The derived statement however does not state an abundance function for lucifer-ase but the originally tested protein (indirectly via its promotor) i.e., Myocd.
Here, the inserted promoter information is given at the end of the sentence, although it is often provided in a sepa-rate sentence.
The second BEL statement in Example 4 pro-vides another relation type, which is not directly captured by the shared task annotations.
Nega-86tive results are annotated in BEL statements with the relation causesNoChange and are valuable relations in causal reasoning.
They might be in-terpreted using the negation annotation in shared task to capture this type of event.
Those examples are only a few out of numer-ous others.
For the development of suitable sys-tems, annotated training corpora are crucial.
The BEL documents might be a good starting point to generate further training corpora containing a high number of such evidence examples.
How-ever, the conversion of the BEL statements to BioNLP shared task annotation is not trivial, since position information is completely missing.
Nevertheless, it might reduce the annotation ef-fort, give good examples and serve as a basis for biological interpretation of the relations.
For ini-tial automatic systems it might be even sufficient to offer such experimental evidence sentences in addition to the extracted relations to users.
7 Discussion and Conclusions  Generally, a syntactic conversion of BioNLP shared task annotations to BEL terms and state-ments is possible and in most cases without in-formation loss.
Tools developed or adapted for the BioNLP shared task are principally suited for the generation of causal BEL networks.
Howev-er, the analysis of the automatically converted BEL statements from the BioNLP shared tasks shows that in a number of cases incomplete BEL statements were generated.
Part of the reason is the need for an additional interpretation layer that would help in generating biologically mean-ingful statements.
Another reason for the failure to extract full statements is the distribution of the relation over more than one sentence.
The properties of BEL statements and the addi-tional information coded in the BEL documents represent a valuable resource for generating fur-ther training data for the development of more real-world oriented systems.
Unfortunately, the information of the BEL documents cannot direct-ly be converted back to textual annotation.
The main reason is that the position information of entities within the relation is missing.
Reverse engineering is also challenging because the trig-ger words are not given.
Furthermore, normaliza-tion to namespaces used in BEL statements makes the direct mapping difficult.
Nevertheless, the text mining community can learn from the BEL documents what are relevantstatements for causal reasoning and from which evidence sentences humans extract the infor-mation.
The example BEL statements given show that humans use a number of experimental systems such as inactive versions of proteins or reporter genes to prove existing relationships.
It might be a realistic task to use BEL documents as a starting point to generate training corpora for the automatic classification of such sentences and for information extraction systems to extract relations from those sentences.
For some rela-tions like the phosphorylation or the reporter genes, we might be even able to extract relations over sentences when enough training data is available.
Another problem not tackled by the BioNLP shared tasks is the mapping to the name spaces.
There are already systems available combining BioNLP based relation extraction systems and named entity recognition (NER) systems allow-ing for normalization and (eg.
Bj?rne et al 2012 and Van Landeghem et al 2013).
Future sys-tems have to combine relation extraction and NER systems allowing for normalization.
Gene and protein names have already been in the focus of the BioCreative assessments during the last years (cf.
Morgan et al 2008 and Lu et al  2011).
In addition, chemical entities are coming more and more into the focus of the community (e.g., in the BioCreative 2013 task15).
In the ex-amples from the BEL corpus we see additional problems coming from the area of engineered genes.
Name variants are often used (e.g., Sin-/- or CMV-luciferase- Myocd 3' UTR-luciferase), which causes further problems in the normaliza-tion task.
Bridging the BEL and the BioNLP-ST com-munity offers benefits for both sides.
The Bio-NLP shared tasks are a considerable start for the automatic generation of causal networks.
Moreo-ver, already available BEL documents can sup-port the generation of the huge amount of addi-tional training data, which is necessary for fur-ther relation extraction development.15 http://www.biocreative.org/events/biocreative-iv/CFP/87Acknowledgments We would like to thank Natalie Catlett and Ted Slater of Selventa for providing their time and expertise in helping us understand BEL.
