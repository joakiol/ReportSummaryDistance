We investigate variousphonetic patterns, both in stressed and un-stressed syllables.
We proceed from regu-lar sound correspondences which are auto-matically extracted from the aligned tran-scriptions and analyzed using PARAFAC.This enables us to analyze simultaneouslythe co-occurrence patterns of all soundcorrespondences found in the data set anddetermine the most important factors ofthe variation.
The first ten dimensions areexamined in more detail by recovering thegeographical distribution of the extractedcorrespondences.
We also compare dia-lect divisions based on the extracted cor-respondences to the divisions based on thewhole data set and to the traditional schol-arship as well.
The results show that PAR-AFAC can be successfully used to detectthe linguistic basis of the automaticallyobtained dialect divisions.1 IntroductionDialectometry is a multidisciplinary field that usesquantitative methods in the analysis of dialectdata.
From the very beginning, most of the re-search in dialectometry has been focused on theidentification of dialect groups and developmentof methods that would tell us how similar (or dif-ferent) one variety is when compared to the neigh-boring varieties.
Dialect data is usually analyzedon the aggregate level by summing up the differ-ences between various language varieties into asingle number.
The main drawback of aggregateanalyses is that it does not expose the underlyinglinguistic structure, i.e.
the specific linguistic ele-ments that contributed to the differences betweenthe dialects.
In recent years there have been sev-eral attempts to automatically extract linguisticbasis from the aggregate analysis, i.e.
to determinewhich linguistic features are responsible for whichdialect divisions.
Although interesting for dialect-ology itself, this kind of research is very importantin the investigation of sound variation and change,both on the synchronic and diachronic level.The paper is structured as follows.
In the nextsection, we discuss a number of earlier approachesto the problem of identifying underlying linguisticstructure in dialect divisions.
In section 3, we givea description of the dialect data used in this re-search.
Section 4 then describes the methodologyof our method, explaining our data representationusing tensors, our three-way factorization method,and the design of our data set.
In section 5, the res-ults of our method are discussed, examining thevalues that come out of our factorization methodin a number of ways.
Section 6, then, draws con-clusions and gives some pointers for future work.2 Previous workIn order to detect the linguistic basis of dialectvariation Nerbonne (2006) applied factor analysisto the results of the dialectometric analysis ofsouthern American dialects.
The analysis is basedon 1132 different vowels found in the data.
204vowel positions are investigated, where a vowelposition is, e.g., the first vowel in the word ?Wash-ington?
or the second vowel in the word ?thirty?.Factor analysis has shown that 3 factors are mostimportant, explaining 35% of the total amount ofvariation.
However, this approach is based only onvowel positions in specific words.Proki?c (2007) extracted the 10 most frequentnon-identical sound correspondences from thealigned word transcriptions.
Based on the relativefrequency of each of these correspondences eachsite in the data set was assigned a correspondenceindex.
Higher value of this index indicates sites46where the presence of a certain sound is domin-ant with respect to some sound alternation.
Al-though successful in describing some importantsound alternations in the dialect variation, it ex-amines only the 10 most frequent sound alterna-tions without testing patterns of variation betweendifferent sound correspondences.Shackleton (2007) applies principal compon-ent analysis (PCA) to a group of self constructedarticulation-based features.
All segments found inthe data are translated into vectors of numericalfeatures and analyzed using PCA.
Based on thecomponent scores for features, different groupsof varieties (in which a certain group of featuresis present) are identified.
We note that the maindrawback of this approach is the subjectivity of thefeature selection and segment quantification.Wieling and Nerbonne (2009) used a bipart-ite spectral graph partitioning method to simul-taneously cluster dialect varieties and sound cor-respondences.
Although promising, this methodcompares the pronunciation of every site only tothe reference site, rather than comparing it to allother sites.
Another drawback of this method isthat it does not use any information on the frequen-cies of sound correspondences, but instead em-ploys binary features to represent whether a cer-tain correspondence is present at a certain site ornot.In this paper we present an approach that triesto overcome some of the problems described inthe previous approaches.
It proceeds from auto-matically aligned phonetic transcriptions, wherepronunciations of every site are compared to thecorresponding pronunciations for all other sites.Extracted sound correspondences are analyzed us-ing the multi-way decomposition method PARA-FAC.
The method allows us to make generaliza-tions over multi-way co-occurrence data, and tolook simultaneously at the co-occurrence patternsof all sound correspondences found in the data set.3 Data descriptionThe data set used in this paper consists of phon-etic transcriptions of 152 words collected at 197sites evenly distributed all over Bulgaria.
It is partof the project Buldialect ?
Measuring Linguisticunity and diversity in Europe.
Phonetic transcrip-tions include various diacritics and suprasegment-als, making the total number of unique phones inthe data set 95: 43 vowels and 52 consonants.1The sign for primary stress is moved to a cor-responding vowel, so that there is a distinctionbetween stressed and unstressed vowels.
Vowelsare also marked for their length.
Sonorants /r/ and/l/ have a mark for syllabicity and for stress in casethey are syllabic.
Here we list all phones presentin the data set:"A, e, i, "e, @, "E, 7, "6, A, I, o, "o, u, "A:, U, "u:, "7, "@,"a, "i, "I, "e:, E, "O, "2, "i:, "u, e:, 1, "1, "o:, "E:, "7:, u:, A:,y, "a:, a, o:, 7:, "U, "y, "I:, j, g, n, nj, ?, r, w, x, rj, h,C, f, s, v, c?, F, p,>?, m, k,>?C, pj, c, l, lj, t, tj, S, d, dj,"r", vj,>dz, Z, ?,>?, r", cj, z, sj, b, gj, mj, l", zj, "l", kj, bj,>?
?,>dz, fj, ?Each of the 152 words in the data set showsphonetic variation, with some words displayingmore than one change.
There are in total 39 dif-ferent dialectal features that are represented in thedata set, with each of the features being present ina similar number of words.
For example, the re-flexes of Old Bulgarian vowels that show dialectvariation are represented with the same or nearlythe same number of words.
A more detailed de-scription of all features can be found in Proki?c etal.
(2009).
For all villages only one speaker wasrecorded.
In the data set, for some villages therewere multiple pronunciations of the same word.
Inthis reasearch we have randomly picked only oneper every village.4 Methodology4.1 TensorsCo-occurrence data (such as the sound corres-pondences used in this research) are usually rep-resented in the form of a matrix.
This form is per-fectly suited to represent two-way co-occurrencedata, but for co-occurrence data beyond twomodes, we need a more general representation.The generalization of a matrix is called a tensor.A tensor is able to encode co-occurrence data ofany n modes.
Figure 1 shows a graphical com-parison of a matrix and a tensor with three modes?
although a tensor can easily be generalized tomore than three modes.Tensor operations come with their own algeb-raic machinery.
We refer the interested reader toKolda and Bader (2009) for a thorough and in-sightful introduction to the subject.1The data is publicly available and can be down-loaded from http://www.bultreebank.org/BulDialects/index.html47	Figure 1: Matrix representation vs. tensor representation.4.2 PARAFACIn order to create a succinct and generalizedmodel, the co-occurrence data are often ana-lyzed with dimensionality reduction techniques.One of the best known dimensionality reductiontechniques is principal component analysis (PCA,Pearson (1901)).
PCA transforms the data into anew coordinate system, yielding the best possiblefit in a least squares sense given a limited num-ber of dimensions.
Singular value decomposition(SVD) is the generalization of the eigenvalue de-composition used in PCA (Wall et al, 2003).To be able to make generalizations among thethree-way co-occurrence data, we apply a statist-ical dimensionality reduction technique called par-allel factor analysis (PARAFAC, Harshman (1970);Carroll and Chang (1970)), a technique that hasbeen sucessfully applied in areas such as psycho-logy and bio-chemistry.
PARAFAC is a multilinearanalogue of SVD.
The key idea is to minimize thesum of squares between the original tensor and thefactorized model of the tensor.

zi?2F(1)The algorithm results in three matrices, indic-ating the loadings of each mode on the factorizeddimensions.
The model is represented graphicallyin Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2 visualizes the factthat the PARAFAC decomposition consists of thesummation over the outer products of n (in thiscase three) vectors.
Figure 3 represents the threeresulting matrices that come out of the factoriza-tion, indicating the loadings of each mode on thefactorized dimensions.
We will be using the latterrepresentation in our research.Computationally, the PARAFAC model is fittedby applying an alternating least-squares algorithm.In each iteration, two of the modes are fixed andthe third one is fitted in a least squares sense.
Thisprocess is repeated until convergence.24.3 Sound correspondencesIn order to detect the most important sound vari-ation within Bulgarian dialects, we proceed fromextracting all sound correspondences from theautomatically aligned word transcriptions.
Alltranscriptions were pairwise aligned using theLevenshtein algorithm (Levenshtein, 1965) as im-plemented in the program L04.3The Leven-shtein algorithm is a dynamic programming al-gorithm used to measure the differences betweentwo strings.
The distance between two strings isthe smallest number of insertions, deletions, andsubstitutions needed to transform one string to theother.
In this work all three operations were as-signed the same value, namely 1.
The algorithm isalso directly used to align two sequences.
An ex-ample showing two aligned pronunciations of theword v?lna /v7lna/ ?wool?
is given in Figure 4.4v "7 - n Av "A l n @Figure 4: Example of two pairwise aligned wordtranscriptions.From the aligned transcriptions for all wordsand all villages in the data set we first extracted2The algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB, usingthe Tensor Toolbox for sparse tensor calculations (Bader andKolda, 2009).3http://www.let.rug.nl/kleiweg/L044For some pairs of transcriptions there are two or morepossible alignments, i.e.
alignments that have the same cost.In these cases we have randomly picked only one of them.48Figure 2: Graphical representation of PARAFAC as the sum of outer products.Figure 3: Graphical representation of the PARAFAC as three loadings matrices.all corresponding non-identical sounds.
For ex-ample, from the aligned transcriptions in Figure 4we would extract the following sound pairs: ["7]-["A], [-]-[l], [A]-[@].
The hyphen (?-?)
stands for amissing (i.e.
inserted or deleted) sound, and in fur-ther analyses it is treated the same as any soundin the data set.
For each pair of correspondingsounds from the data set we counted how often itappeared in the aligned transcriptions for each pairof villages separately.
In total we extracted 907sound correspondences and stored the informationon each of them in a separate matrix.
Every matrixrecords the distances between each two villagesin the data set, measured as the number of timesa certain phonetic alternation is recorded whilecomparing pronunciations from these sites.Since we are interested in analyzing all soundcorrespondences simultaneously, we merged theinformation from all 907 two-mode matrices intoa three-mode tensor n?n?v, where n representsthe sites in the data set, and v represents the soundalternations.
By arranging our data in a cube in-stead of a matrix, we are able to look into severalsets of variables simultaneously.
We are especiallyinterested in the loadings for the third mode, thatcontains the values for the sound correspondences.5 ResultsIn order to detect the most prominent sound cor-respondences we analyzed the three-mode tensordescribed in the previous section using a PARAFACfactorization with k = 10 dimensions.
In Table 5we present only the first five dimensions extractedby the algorithm.
The final model fits 44% of theoriginal data.
The contribution of the first extrac-ted dimension (dim1) to the final fit of the modelis the largest ?
23.81 per cent ?
while the next fourdimensions contribute to the final fit with similarpercentages: dim2 with 10.63 per cent, dim3 with9.50 per cent, dim4 with 9.26 per cent, and dim5with 9.09 per cent.
Dimensions six to ten contrib-ute in the range from 8.66 per cent to 6.98 per cent.For every dimension we extracted the twentysound correspondences with the highest scores.
Inthe first dimension we find 11 pairs involving vow-els and 9 involving consonant variation.
The threesound correspondences with the highest scoresare the [A]-[@], [o]-[u], and [e]-[i] alternations.This finding corresponds well with the traditionalscholarly views on Bulgarian phonetics (Woodand Pettersson, 1988; Barnes, 2006) where we findthat in unstressed syllables mid vowels [e] and [o]raise to neutralize with the high vowels [i] and [u].The low vowel [a] raises to merge with [@].For every sound alternation we also check theirgeographical distribution.
We do so by applyingthe following procedure.
From the aligned pairsof transcriptions we extract corresponding pairs ofsounds for every alternation.
We count how manytimes each of the two sounds appears in the tran-scriptions for every village.
Thus, for every pair ofsound correspondences, we can create two mapsthat show the distribution of each of the soundsseparately.
On the map of Bulgaria these values49Table 1: First five dimensions for the sound cor-respondences.dim1 dim2 dim3 dim4 dim5[A]-[@] [@]-[7] [u]-[o] [A]-[@] [e]-[i][u]-[o] [e]-[i] [A]-[7] [@]-[7] [i]-["e][e]-[i] ["e]-["E] [A]-[@] [U]-[o] [e]-[@][-]-[j] [-]-[j] [7]-[e] [e]-[@] [r]-[rj][e]-["e] [S]-[C] [e]-["e] [d]-[dj] [d]-[dj][S]-[C] [>?

[i]-[@] [v]-[-] [@]-["A] [@]-["A]["7]-["O] [v]-[vj] [A]-["7] [e]-[i] [b]-[bj]are represented using a gradual color, which en-ables us to see not only the geographic distributionof a certain sound but also how regular it is in agiven sound alternation.
The highest scoring sitesare coloured black and the lowest scoring sites arecoloured white.In Figure 5 we see the geographical distribu-tion of the first three extracted correspondences.The first two alternations [A]-[@] and [o]-[u] havealmost the same geographical distribution and di-vide the country into west and east.
While in thewest there is a clear presence of vowels [A] and [o],in the east those vowels would be pronounced as[@] and [u].
The division into east and west corres-ponds well with the so-called jat line, which is,according to traditional dialectologists (Stojkov,2002) the main dialect border in Bulgaria.
On themaps in Figure 5 we represent it with the black linethat roughly divides Bulgaria into east and west.The third correspondence follows a slightly dif-ferent pattern: mid vowel [e] is present not onlywest of the jat line, but also in the southern partof the country, in the region of Rodopi mountains.In the central and northeastern areas this sound ispronounced as high vowel [i].
For all three soundcorrespondences we see a clear two-way divisionof the country, with almost all sites being charac-terized by one of the two pronunciations, which,as we shall see later, is not always the case dueto multiple reflections of some sounds at certainpositions.We also note that the distribution of the soundcorrespondences that involve soft consonants andtheir counterparts have the same east-west dis-tribution (see Figure 6).
In the first dimensionwe find the following consonants and their pal-atal counterparts [n], [d], [l], [v] and [r], but be-cause of space limitations we show maps onlyfor three correspondences.
The east-west divisionalso emerges with respect to the distribution of the[A]-[7] and ["e]-["A] sounds.Unlike the correspondences mentioned before,the [S]-[C], [>?
]-[>?C], and [Z]-[?]
pairs are definingthe south part of the country as a separate zone.As shown on the maps in Figure 7, the southernpart of the country (the region of Rodopi moun-tains) is characterized by a soft pronunciation of[S], [>?]
and [Z].
In traditonal literature on Bul-garain dialectology (Stojkov, 2002), we also findthat soft pronunciation of [S], [>?]
and [Z] is one ofthe most important phonetic features of the variet-ies in the Rodopi zone.
Based on the correspond-ences extracted in the first dimension, this areais also defined by the presence of the vowel ["E]in stressed syllables (["e]-["E] and ["A]-["E] corres-pondences).In some extracted correspondences, only one ofthe sounds has a geographically coherent distri-bution, like in the case of the [7]-[e] pair where[e] is found in the west and south, while the [7]sound is only sporadically present in the centralregion.
This kind of asymmetrical distribution isalso found with respect to the pair [A]-[7].Most of the sound correspondences in the firstdimension either divide the country along the jatline or separate the Rodopi area from the rest of thevarieties.
The only two exceptions are the [-]-[j]and ["7]-["O] pairs.
They both define the southwestarea as a separate zone, while the northwest sharesits pronunciation of the sound in question with theeastern part of the country.We use the first 20 correspondences from thefirst dimension and perform k-means clustering inorder to check which dialect areas would emergebased on this limited set of sound correspond-50Figure 5: [A]-[@] (left), [o]-[u] (middle), [e]-[i] (right) sound correspondences.Figure 6: [d]-[dj] (left), [v]-[vj] (middle), [r]-[rj] (right) sound correspondences.ences.
The results of the 2-way, 3-way and 4-wayclustering are given in Figure 8.In two-way clustering the algorithm detects aneast-west split approximately along the jat line,slightly moved to the east.
This fully corres-ponds to the traditional dialectology but also tothe results obtained using Levenshtein algorithmon the whole data set where only east, west andsouth varieties could be asserted with great con-fidence (Proki?c and Nerbonne, 2008).
In Figure 9we present the dialect divisions that we get if thedistances between the sites are calculated usingwhole word transcriptions instead of only the 20most prominent sound correspondences.
We no-tice a high correspondence between the two ana-lyses at the two- and three-level division.
On thelevel of four and more groups, the two analysesstart detecting different groups.
In the analysisbased on 20 sound correspondences, southern dia-lects are divided into smaller and smaller groups,while in the analysis based on the whole data set,the area in the west ?
near the Serbian border ?emerges as the fourth group.
This is no surprise, asthe first 20 extracted correspondences do not con-tain any sounds typical only for this western area.In order to compare two divisions of sites, wecalculated the adjusted Rand index (Hubert andArabie, 1985).
The adjusted Rand index (ARI) isused in classification for comparing two differentpartitions of a finite set of objects.
It is based onthe Rand index (Rand, 1971), one of the most pop-ular measures for comparing the degree to whichpartitions agree (in classification).
Value 1 of theARI indicates that two classifications match per-fectly, while value 0 means that two partitions donot agree on any pair of points.
For both two-level and three-level divisions of the sites the ARIfor two classifications is 0.84.
We also compared51Figure 7: [S]-[C] (left), [>?
]-[>?C] (middle), [Z]-[?]
(right) sound correspondences.Figure 8: Dialect varieties detected by k-means clustering algorithm based on the first 20 sound corres-pondences in the first dimension.Figure 9: Dialect varieties detected by k-means clustering algorithm based on all word transcriptions.both of the classifications to the classification ofthe sites done by Stojkov (2002).
For the classi-fication based on the first dimension extracted byPARAFAC, ARI is 0.73 for two-way and 0.64 forthe three-way division.
ARI score for the clas-sification based on whole word transcriptions is0.69 for two-way and 0.62 for three-way.
As in-dicated by ARI the two classifications correspondwith a high degree to each other, but to the tra-ditional classification as well.
We note that two-way classification based on the extracted soundcorrespondences corresponds higher to the tradi-tional classification than classification that takesall sounds into account.We conclude that the sound correspondencesdetected by PARAFAC form the linguistic basisof the two-way and three-way divisions of Bul-garian dialect area.
Using the PARAFAC methodwe are able to detect that the most important soundchanges on which two-way division is based are[o]-[u], [A]-[@] and palatal pronunciation of con-sonants.
In the three-way division of sites doneby k-means, the area in the south of the countryappears as the third most important dialect zone.In the twenty investigated sound correspondenceswe find that the soft pronunciation of [S],[>?]
and[Z] sounds is typical only for the varieties in thisarea.
Apart from divisions that divide the countryinto west and east, including the southern variet-ies, we also detect sound correspondences whosedistribution groups together western and southernareas.We also analyzed in more depth sound corres-pondences extracted in other dimensions by thePARAFAC algorithm.
Most of the correspondencesfound in the first dimension, also reappear in thefollowing nine dimensions.
Closer inspection ofthe language groups obtained using information52from these dimensions show that eastern, westernand southern varieties are the only three that areidentified.
No other dialect areas were detectedbased on the sound correspondences from thesenine dimensions.6 ConclusionIn this paper we have applied PARAFAC in the taskof detecting the linguistic basis of dialect phoneticvariation.
The distances between varieties wereexpressed as a numerical vector that records in-formation on all sound correspondences found inthe data set.
Using PARAFAC we were able to ex-tract the most important sound correspondences.Based on the 20 most important sound correspond-ences we performed clustering of all sites in thedata set and were able to detect three groups ofsites.
As found in traditional literature on Bul-garian dialects, these three dialects are the maindialect groups in Bulgaria.
Using the aggregateapproach on the same data set, the same three dia-lects were the only groups in the data that could beasserted with high confidence.
We conclude thatthis approach is successful in extracting underly-ing linguistic structure in dialect variation, whileat the same time overcoming some of the problemsfound in the earlier approaches to this problem.In future work sounds in the data set could bedefined in a more sophisticated way, using somekind of feature representation.
Also, the role ofstress should be examined in more depth, sincethere are different patterns of change in stressedin unstressed syllables.
We would also like to ex-tend the method and examine more than just twosound correspondences at a time.ReferencesBrett W. Bader and Tamara G. Kolda.
