This paper thus describes theongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF(Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how itcan be concretely implemented for the design of anon-line morphological resource for French in theMorphalou project.1 IntroductionLexical resources play a crucial role in mostapplications related to human language technology.They may be used by both human readers andautomatic processors for a wide range of activitiesthat require an even wider variety of lexicalstructures.
Some applications may demand broadlinguistic coverage, where the word is the entrypoint and all the possible senses are attached tothem, whereas other applications could require aconcept-based organization of the lexical data,from which the relevant words (or terms) may bederived.
Some applications barely need more thena simple list of words, whereas other may require aprecise morpho-syntactic, syntactic and semanticdescription of the various lexical entries.Furthermore, the huge cost of creating andmaintaining a lexical resource in any of thesedomains requires that they should not be designedin isolation but that they may potentially be linkedwith one another for mutual enrichment.As a consequence, we believe that there is astrong need for more widely accepted methods forspecifying lexical structures, so that the conditionsunder which the corresponding databases canexchange data are precisely defined.
Moreover, itseems that enough knowledge has been gatheredacross the years to contemplate the idea that suchtechnical principles and methods could be thesource of an international standard that wouldpreserve the possibility of both describing varioustypes of formats and ensuring interoperabilityamong them.This paper will present such a methodology ascurrently under discussion in the context of ISOcommittee TC 37/SC 4 in its on-going projectcalled LMF (Lexical Markup Framework, whichwill become the future ISO 24613 standard).
Thisinternational context also provides us with aunique opportunity to experiment with these mostrecent proposals in the context of the concretenecessity to deploy an open morphologicaldictionary for French (the Morphalou project).
Wewill centre the discussion here on mapping themodelling principles that have been agreed upon sofar in the LMF project with the actual requirementsassociated with the design of a morphologicallexicon, hoping that it may lead to similar activitieson lexical modelling in the future.2 Standards for lexical resourcesBefore describing the ongoing standardizationefforts within the LMF project, it is essential to getan idea of the actual background available to us inlexical representation at large and see how LMFmay build upon, or rather receive input from, otherpast or ongoing standardization activities.Lexical structures can classically be viewedaccording to the way they organize the relationbetween words and senses: either senses areconsidered as subdivisions of the lexical entry (thesemasiological view of lexical data, which is theone usually applied in print dictionaries) or on thecontrary, it is assumed that words (or ?terms?)
aredescribed as ways of expressing a priori concepts,(the onomasiological view).The onomasiological view has formed the basisfor most previous standardization efforts since it isat the focus of many applied contexts.
This trendstarted quite a while ago when the first standardsfor thesaurus representation were issued in thedocumentary field (ISO 2788 and ISO 5964).Those standards basically organize lexical matteras hierarchies of terms (e.g.
broader-narrowerterms), with the possibility of adding some basiclexical information (e.g.
equivalences).
Morerecently, the terminological field has providedmore elaborate standards within ISO committeeTC 37, starting from the definition of an initialSGML/XML-based  represen ta t ion  forterminologies (ISO 12200), and progressing on tothe design of a flexible platform for specifyingterminological structures (ISO 16642).
The mainproblem with the onomasiological view is thateven if it is well suited for providing homogeneouslexical descriptions within an application domain,it is hardly extensible when broader linguisticcoverage is required.In contrast, the semasiological view allows anexhaustive survey of lexical content for a givenlanguage.
In particular, it provides the basis for anyclassical editorial (or print) dictionary, but the widevariety of possible dictionary formats seems tohave hampered the development of internationalstandards in this domain.
The two main initiativesthat can be cited here are on the one hand the ISO1951 standard dedicated solely to therepresentation of dictionary entries, and on theother hand, the seminal work done within the TEI1on print dictionaries, which, even though it hasalready been applied to some large scale projectssuch as the OED2, the Deutsches W?rterbuch3orthe Anglo-Norman dictionary4, has never beenconsidered by publishers in particular as a realinternational standard.
As a consequence, manyrelevant projects such as the TLFi5( Dendien &Pierrel, 2003) have designed their own proprietarystructure for the description of their lexicalarchives.If one moves away from classical dictionariesproper and considers lexical resources dedicated tothe domain of NLP, there are numerous projectsthat have worked toward the definition ofstandardized lexical structures in the domain ofNLP (Multext for basic morphological lexica;Genelex, Simple, Isle/Mile for complexmultilingual entries; OLIF 1&2 for translationlexica, etc.
), but none of them has lead to astandard that reflects a wide internationalconsensus and that is effectively maintained by anauthoritative body.From a more theoretical point of view, it hasbeen shown that such lexical structures can bemodelled as feature structures (Ide et ali, 1995;Veronis & Ide, 1992), leading to inheritanceproperties within entries (Ide et ali, 2000), aspartially implemented in the TEI Print Dictionarychapter (Ide &Veronis, 1995).
It has also been1Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.or)2http://dictionary.oed.com/3http://www.DWB.uni-trier.de4http://www.mhra.org.uk/5http://www.atilf.fr/_ns/produits/tlfi.htmshown that, with respect to describing the micro-structure of such lexica, at least threeconfigurations are possible: 2-layered, 3-layeredand 7-layered models.
In the 2-layered approach,following Ferdinand de Saussure (1974), a word isdescribed by a signifier/signified pair, corres-ponding to a morphological/semantic description.The syntactic behaviour of the word is thensystematically attached to the semantic description.This is the approach that has been retained forLMF.
In the 3-layer approach (Antoni-Lay et ali,1994), a word is described by three units: amorphological, a syntactic and a semantic unit asin Genelex or Eagles.
It should be noted that due tothe fact that the syntactic unit is a mandatoryconnection between morphology and semantics,such a model is necessarily heavy and complex.
Inthe 7-layered approach (Mel?cuk et ali, 1995), aword is described by various units in surfacephonology, deep phonology, surface morphology,deep morphology, surface syntax, deep syntax andsemantics.
This approach imposes a heavy burdenon the lexical description task.Let us stress here the necessity of guaranteeingthat the methods used to describe onomasiologicaland semasiological structures shall not becompletely different, so that it is possible (asrequired by industrial applications in particular) tocombine various kinds of lexical resources, butalso to open the way for lexical architectures tocombine concept-based and word-baseddescriptions as evidenced in the EDR dictionary6,the Papillon project7, or IBM?s TransLexisresource.3 The Lexical Markup Framework projectThe LMF proposal, as currently being developedin ISO committee TC 37/SC 4, is conceived as ageneric platform for the specification of lexicalstructures at any level of linguistic description.
Assuch, it does not provide one single model, butrather a mechanism by which implementers com-bine elementary lexical subsystems to designmodels that can be both as close as possible to theirneeds and comparable to any other lexical modelsbased on the same principles and, possibly, on thesame components.The underlying data model for LMF follows thegeneral principles of the linguistic annotationscheme design stated in Ide & Romary, 2003 andimplemented in the context of ISO standard 16642for the representation of terminological data(Romary, 2001).
Those principles provide amechanism for combining a given structural6http://www2.crl.go.jp/kk/e416/EDR/index.html7http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/metamodel that informs the general organization ofa certain level of linguistic information (morpho-logy, syntax, etc.)
with elementary descriptors (so-called data categories).
Data categories reflectbasic linguistic concepts (e.g.
/part of speech/,/grammatical  number/, /paucal number/, etc.)
andallow for recording language-specific propertiesindependently of linguistic level specific models.In order to share data categories within thecommunity, on-going work (in ISO/TC 37) is inthe process of deploying an on-line registry8ofthem, especially for use in conjunction with theother standardization activities.According to these principles, LMF consists ofthe following elements:?
a core metamodel (i.e.
the structural skeletonshared by any linguistic description at thelexical level);?
mechanisms for attaching lexical extensions(see below) to the core metamodel in order tobuild up more complex metamodels;?
mechanisms for selecting data categories usedfor lexical description and for determining howthey relate to a metamodel;?
mechanisms for expressing any combination ofthe core metamodel and data categories asXML structures, i.e.
by deciding to implementa given data category (/gender/) as an XMLelement rather than as an attribute and byproviding the corresponding vocabularies(?gen?, ?gender?, ?genre?);?
methods for describing how to extend LMF toanalyze, design, and describe a variety of morespecific lexical resources.As shown in Figure 1, the core metamodel ofLMF is organized as a purely hierarchical structurebuilt upon the following components:The Lexical database component gathers up allinformation related to a given lexicon;The Global information component groupstogether all the metadata  (e.g.
version,contributors, up-date, etc.)
that can be globallyattached to the lexicon (see 4.4);The Lexical entry component comprises theelementary lexical unit in a lexical database.
Thiscomponent can, of course, be iterated, but nospecific constraint is expressed as to  its level ofgranularity in a lexical database (e.g.
propertreatment of homonyms), since this depends highlyon languages and local editorial practices;The Form component groups together all thegeneral graphical or phonetic descriptions attachedto the lexical entry (reference orthographic form,transliteration, hyphenation, pronunciation, etc.
);8An experimental on-line data category registry isaccessible under http://syntax.loria.frFinally, the Sense component is the one thatactually organizes the lexical entry since it can beboth repeated and further subdivided into senses.In a word-to-sense lexical structure, it is indeedthought that this central way of organizing a lexicalentry should be part of the metamodel.Lexical DB1..1Global Info1..1Lexical Entry0..n1..11..1Form1..1Sense0..n1..10..n1..1LexicalextensionsLexicalextensionLexicalextensionFigure 1: Core model and lexical extensions in LMFIn order to specify more complex models thanwould be expressible with just the core metamodel,LMF introduces the notion of lexical extensions.Those extensions correspond to clusters of com-ponents dedicated to the representation of aspecific type of lexical information (e.g.
morpho-logy, syntactic constructions, transfer patterns(socalled interlingua), and theory dependant lexi-cographical approaches such as Mel?cuk et al1995 or V?ronis, 2000).
Each lexical extension ischaracterized by an anchor component, which iseither a component of the core metamodel or ofanother lexical extension when more complexcombinations are being considered (e.g.
descrip-tion of morphological operations used to extend asimple morphological lexical extension).The future LMF standard as such should notprovide a specific list of data categories to be usedfor lexical descriptions.
This would by far be toocomplex given, as we have seen, the potentialvariety of applications.
It is thus expected thatimplementers will systematically refer to theISO/TC 37 data category registry to find theadequate descriptive background for their ownpurposes.
Still, we can outline the basic types ofdata categories that one could encounter in an LMFbased application, namely:?
data categories that may be considered asrather specific to the domain of lexicaldescription: these are typically those attachedto the Form component (/pronunciation/,/syllabification/, /stress pattern/ etc.)
or to theSense component (e.g.
/definition/, /example/,/etymology/, etc.).
Some of these categorieshave already been partially described in the?old?
ISO 12620:1999 standard, but a moreprecise list should be compiled as the work onLMF is being completed;?
data categories that relate to a specific level oflinguistic description such as morphology, syn-tax, etc.
The strategy here is to avoid definingad hoc descriptors dedicated to lexical struc-tures and to enforce coherence with other stan-dardization activities by adopting those asso-ciated with the development of related stan-dards.
For instance, data categories such as/grammatical category/, /grammatical gender/or /grammatical case/ should be sharedbetween POS tagging applications and corres-ponding lexical descriptions;?
data categories corresponding to metadata des-criptors used to document the production andmaintenance of a lexical database, a lexicalentry and probably, of any component in alexical structure (see 4.4).To conclude this brief presentation of LMF,which can only be considered to be a snapshot ofthe ongoing discussions about it, it is important toconsider how it provides a whole standardizationspectrum for implementers who will want to applyit for their own purposes.
At a first level, they canlimit themselves to the core model, to standardizedlexical extensions and to the data categories thatare available in the DCR.
Doing so, they will havethe certainty of being fully interoperable with anyother implementation that has adopted the samescope.
If necessary, it is possible for implementersto define some proprietary data categories ormaybe their own lexical extensions, knowing thatthe corresponding part of their lexical model willprobably require more work if they wants tointerchange data with other applications.
Still, sucha strategy is probably the optimal one in thecurrent stage of LMF, since, for instance, we donot know yet which lexical extensions will besufficiently consensual to be further adopted asinternational standards.
This is indeed the spirit inwhich the Morphalou project has been established,i.e.
to design a simple morphological lexicalextension to the LMF core principles and see howit could be validated when confronted with the realdevelopment of a lexical resource.
In the long run,we do expect that some combinations of the coremetamodel and some standardized lexicalextensions may also be seen as possible futurestandards when they match specific industrialneeds (e.g.
transfer lexica ?
la OLIF) or existingpractices (e.g.
TEI Print Dictionary format).4 An LMF-based model for a morphologicallexicon4.1 Requirements for a morphological lexiconMorphological dictionaries typically associateinflected word forms (for example plural nouns orpast tense verb forms) with values for relevantmorphological features, such as gender and num-ber for adjectives or person and tense for verbs.
Inaddition, there is often a link to one particular wordform, conventionally chosen as being the lemma.Those dictionaries are basic resources in the fieldof NLP (needed for any application based ontagged and/or lemmatized input data) and in thefield of computer-assisted language acquisition.Most existing morphological resources for NLP(MulText, V?ronis 1999; LEFFF9, Cl?ment &Sagot) occur as text files, whose lines display theinflected word form, one or more morphologicaltags (relative to a given tag-set) and the lemma.This kind of representation, directly inspired byone specific type of usage of such resources (i.e.morphological tagging) takes the inflected form asan entry point.
At the same time, themorphological point of view is an extensional one,in the sense that the resource explicitly contains thelist of all inflected forms for one lemma.Furthermore, the linguistic concepts underlying themorphological description are not directlytransparent and accessible, since the tags aregenerally synthetic tags for a set of values relativeto a set of relevant features.
Finally, if anymetadata (such as the contributor or the last up-date) are associated with such a resource, they areoften encoded in proprietary formats and there isno possibility to parameterize their scope tovarious description levels of the lexicon.Starting from these observations, we tested LMFas a formal framework for the design of amorphological dictionary for French, based onexisting data originally compiled during thedigitization of a wide coverage French dictionary(TFLi).
From a theoretical point of view, the aimof this experiment is to test the suitability of LMFat a quite simple level of lexical description.
Onthe practical side, we wish to generate a resourcethat is accessible on-line and that implements thestandardization proposals of ISO/TC 37/SC 4, andthat is application-independent, well documented,extensible and provides the possibility to addfurther lexical description levels, such as syntacticand semantic information.
Therefore, we have triedto overcome the aforementioned shortcomings ofcurrent morphological dictionaries by structuringthe data around lemmas rather than aroundinflected forms, by proposing a data model thatcombines the co-occurrence of extensional andintensional morphological information (lists ofinflexions vs. reference to inflexion classes orparadigms) and by paying special attention to theissue of the metadata necessary to qualify theidentification of the source data (origin,contributor, up-date, etc.)
and the status of the data(validated by an editorial committee, testified in acorpus, etc.
).9http://atoll.inria.fr/~lclement/lefff/4.2 The lexical model of MorphalouThe underlying lexical model of the Morphalouproject is a direct application of the LMF prince-ples with the sole addendum of a simple lexicalextension dedicated to the description of morpho-logy.
This extension can be directly linked to thelexical entry component of the core metamodel.
Itassociates a single morphological description(Morphology component) to each lexical entry.This morphological description is made up of twosub-components:?
a Paradigm  component that refers to orpossibly describes the inflexion rules thatgovern the flexional behaviour of the entry;?
an Inflexion component that groups togetherzero up to n  inflected forms related to thelexical entry.LexicalEntryMorphology1..11..1Lexical Entryor gy0..1Paradigm1..1Inflexion0..n1..1Figure 2: Lexical extension for morphologyAs stated in section 3, to build up a full modelfor a concrete lexical database, one needs toassociate a selection of data categories anchored atthe different components of the metamodel (coremetamodel + morphological lexical extension).To the Lexical entry component, we basicallyassociate to this component the data categories/lemma/ and /grammatical category/.
A /key form/is used in order to uniquely identify the entrywithin the lexical database.
Possible orthographicvariants may be recorded as /spelling variant/?s.Finally, depending on editorial choices, one couldalso decide to attach /gender/ information here, forexample for nouns, in the case that gendervariation is not considered as inflexional variation,as opposed to adjectives.To the Inflexion component: beside /word form/,which identifies the actual inflected form in thecomponent, it is necessary to associate the set ofmorphological features to provide a uniquespecification of the inflexion.
The correspondingdata categories are complementary to the generalgrammatical category of the entry: /gender/ and/number/ for adjectives; /tense/, /person/, /number/and /mood/ for verbs, etc.
Appendix 1 provides acomplete list of the data categories we haveconsidered for the first version of the database;?
Paradigm component: here we essentially needa /paradigm identifier/ to identify the inflexionclass to which the lexical entry belongs.
Inorder to integrate further data categories for thedescription of the inflexion rules, we still needto investigate linguistic practices for differentlanguage families.4.3 Implementing the model: basic examplesExample 1 implements, in a generic XMLformat (GMT, see Romary 2001), a simple lexicalentry and its morphological extension for theFrench noun chat (?cat?).
The data categoriesassociated with the lexical entry are /lemma/,/grammatical category/ and /key form/,respectively taking the values of chat, noun andchat_1.
The morphology component contains theidentification of the plural inflexion paradigm forregular French nouns (/fr-s-plural/) and thecomplete list of inflected word forms withassociated morphological features, i.e.
/number/.Example 1<struct type=?lexical entry?><feat type=?lemma?>chat</feat><feat type=?grammatical category?>commonnoun </feat><feat type=?key form?>chat_1</feat><struct type=?morphology?><struct type=?paradigm?><feat type=?paradigm identifier?>fr-s-plural</feat></struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>chat</feat><feat type=?number?>singular</feat></struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>chats</feat><feat type=?number?>plural</feat></struct></struct></struct>In the case that spelling variants exist such ascheik vs. cheikh (Example 2), these are referred toin the lexical entry component by means of thedata category /spelling variant/ and an associatedpointer to the /key form/ of the related lexicalentry.
Additional mechanisms such as unificationmay be envisaged in order to avoid duplication ofthe lexical information that is independent fromthis variation (syntactic or semantic information,for example).Example 2<struct type=?lexical entry?><feat type=?lemma?>cheikh</feat><feat type=?spelling variant?target=?#cheik_noun?</feat><feat type=?grammatical category?>common noun</feat><feat type=?key form?>cheikh_1</feat><struct type=?morphology?>?</struct></struct>Example 3 to Example 5 ?
afghan, ?afghani?,used as masculine and feminine noun and as anadjective ?
shows how data categories, here/gender/, can be used in a flexible way.
Dependingon editorial practices, the implementers may, forexample, chose to attach this feature to the lexicalentry for nouns, and to the inflexion component foradjectives.
They will thus consider masculine andfeminine forms of a noun as different lexicalentries (afghan_1 vs. afghane), while groupingvariations for adjectives into one single gender(afghan_2).Example 3<struct type=?lexical entry?><feat type=?lemma?>afghan</feat><feat type=?grammatical category?>common noun</feat><feat type=?gender?>masculine</feat><feat type=?key form?>afghan_1</feat><struct type=?morphology?>?<struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghan</feat><feat type=?number?>singular</feat></struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghans</feat><feat type=?number?>plural</feat></struct></struct></struct>Example 4<struct type=?lexical entry?><feat type=?lemma?>afghane</feat><feat type=?grammatical category?>common noun</feat><feat type=?gender?>feminine</feat><feat type=?key form?>afghan_2</feat><struct type=?morphology?>?<struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghane</feat><feat type=?number?>singular</feat></struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghanes</feat><feat type=?number?>plural</feat></struct></struct></struct>Example 5<struct type=?lexical entry?><feat type=?lemma?>afghan</feat><feat type=?grammatical category?>adjective</feat><feat type=?key form?>afghan_2</feat><struct type=?morphology?>?<struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghan</feat>?</struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghans</feat>?</struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghane</feat>?</struct><struct type=?inflexion?><feat type=?word form?>afghanes</feat>?</struct></struct>4.4 Integrating metadata descriptorsOne important issue for the management, up-dating and distribution of lexical databases is theappropriate management of metadata, related eitherto the identification of data sources or to thecharacterization of the data.Our proposal is based on several internationalinitiatives related to the definition of descriptorsfor language data collections (cf.
OLAC10,IMDI11).
We currently identify those descriptorsthat may be relevant for lexical databases, such asthe language identifiers (ISO 16620) or the ?roles?defined in OLAC (depositor, developer, research-er, annotator, sponsor, etc.).
Concerning datacharacterization, existing standards (ISO 16620)also contain an inventory of possible useful des-criptors related to the updating process (originationdate, input date, modification date, approval date,withdrawal date, etc.
).Additional information should be more speci-fically related to the morphological extension: Onecould for example wish to keep track of morpho-syntactic tags (relative to a given tagset, such asMultext) currently used to refer to certain in-flexions (see Example 6).
Other useful metadatawould be information about testimony and fre-quency of inflected forms in corpora, completenessof an inflexion list (relevant for defective verbssuch as pleuvoir (?to rain?)
or indication of specialusages (diachronic, diatopic or diastratic variation).Example 6<struct type=?inflexion?><brack><feat type=?POS tag?>Nms__</feat><feat type=?tagset?>Multext</feat></brack><feat type=?word form?>chat</feat><feat type=?number?>singular</feat><struct/>4.5 Morphalou?
: current stateThe basic model described in this paper (apartfrom inflexion paradigms and metadata descrip-tors, currently under definition) has been used tobuild an electronic lexical database of inflectedforms for French12.
It contains 539413 inflectedforms distributed over 68075 lemmas, convertedfrom data previously collected at the ATILFlaboratory.
The whole database is encoded inXML.
Since we envisage on-line access and theability to up-date the data, we devoted particularattention to the interfaces and to documentation.The database is searchable through the web, via agraphical interface or direct XPath queries.
The10http://www.language-archives.org/11http://www.mpi.nl/IMDI/12http://loreley.loria.fr/morphalou/graphical interface allows for lemmatization of agiven form and generation of all inflected formsfor a given lemma, whereas the XPath requestsallows for combining search criteria over anycombination of features and strings (for example,all lexical entries for common nouns having aninflected form containing the string aba).
The nextsteps are the development of a JAVA API and webservices to integrate search results directly intoNLP applications and the development of aneditorial line for efficient and coherent update ofthe database.
Preliminary updating experimentsbased on freely accessible morphological databasessuch as LEFFF and ABU13are currently runningand reveal the most important problems to betackled (conversion of the input format, efficientcomparison of two XML files, linguistic validationprocedures and interfaces for submitted data,fusion of lexical data).5 ReferencesAntoni-Lay MH., Francopoulo G., Zaysser L.(1994).
