in  des ign ing  exper t  and consu l t ingsystems or in  the  area  of  automated programming of  knowledge--based problem so lv ing  systems.
We w i l l  ment ion here problemsof  communicating knowledge between machine and researcher  (auser  of  a system) which i s  not an expert  in  programming tech-h iquev S ince natura l  l an~a~e i s  a "natura l "  form fo r  express -tng  knowledge (and most ext ramathemat ica l  knowledge actua l lyex i s ts  in  th i s  form) i t  could be seemed that  natura l  languagewould be a l so  the best  support  fo r  communicating knowledgethrough a cogn i t ive  process  performed on a computer.
I s  I trea l ly  so?
We want to b r ing  arguments fo r  a ra ther  oppos i tec la im by po in ted  ou~ severa l  fo rmats  fo r  express ing  and commun-toat in~ sc ient i f i c  knowledge which d i f fe rs  from usua l  natura llanguage onesoWhat k inds o f  data s t ruc tures  fo r  express ing  knowledgeand fo r  represent ing  i t  in  a computer memory we need?
Foranswering th i s  quest ion  we have to  d i s t i~p- i sh  at  leas t  tworo les  o f  a user  in  the  process  o f  conmmnication w i th  machine.F i r s t  of  them can be ca l led  a speaker  t I t  character i zes  thes i tuat ion  in  which the user  loads  knowledge in to  a machine.For  such a s i tuat ion  there  i s  important  that  knowledge enter -- 142  -i ng  a computer should be prec i se  and exact  as much as poss ib -le .
So the data s t ruc tures  should enable d isambtguat ion  ofin fo rmat ion .
Such a requ i rement  leads  natura l ly  to  hard con-s t ra in ts  of  input  fo rmats .
On the o ther  hand, not only fo rthe user  conven ience,  i t  should be des i rab le  to  a l low h igh lyf ree  format of  input  in fo rmat ion  to avo id  any apr io r i  l im i ta t -i ons .
Thus, the system should be equipped by an e f fec t ivein terpreter  t rans forming  var ious  k inds of  input  in fo rmat ionin to  in terna l  representat ion  su i tab le  fo r  potent ia l  reason ingprocesses .
The second ro le  of  the user  in  communication w i thcomputer can be ca l led  a l i s tener~ This s i tuat ion  i s  ra therd i f fe rent  from the f i r s t  one.
Here the user  has to under -stand resu l t s  of  computat ions and (espec ia l l y  in  Oonsu l t ingsystems) a lso  var ious  exp lanat ions  resu l t ing  from reason ingprocesses .
These two ro les  can, of  course ,  in f i l t ra te  one in toanother .
Analogous ro les  can be recogn ized  fo r  a machine, too .As a teethed  fo r  our cons iderat ions  an AI p rob lem-or ient -ed designed fo r  an automat ic  data  ana lys i s  (ca l led  GUHA-80)has been chosen.
The task  of  GUHA-80 system i s  to  generate  anddevelop in teres t ing  views onto g iven  empi r i ca l  data ( recogn i -ze tn teres t in~ log ica l  pat te rns ) .
These views should representre levant  in fo rmat ion  conta ined in  the data  and be use fu l  fo rfo rmat ion  of hypotheses .From the po int  of  v iew of  two above mentioned ro les  ofuser  the fo l low ing  types  of  in fo rmat ion  in  the GUHA-80 systemcould be disttn&-tttshed:1.
In fo rmat ion  coming in to  system could conta in  a) data(observat ions  on ob jec ts ) ,  b) suppor t ing  knowledge (apr io r tknowledge about the problem in  quest ion ,  answers of quest ions ) .2.
In fo rmat ion  coming from the system could conta in  a)t race  o f  computat ions and reason ing  ac t iv i t ies ,  b) resu l t s  ofcomputat ions,  c) exp lanat ions  (why such and such operat ionshave been per formed) ,  c f .
~CIN.- 143 -Let us g ive  a hypothet i ca l  example o f  user ' s  communicat-i on  with GUHA-80 system:GUHA-80: by a sing~le l inkage  method us ing  euc l id ian  d i s tanceon the set  of  ob jec ts  the  fo l low ing  dendro~amexpress ing  the s imi la r i ty  between these  ob jec ts  wasobta ined:AnXCDXI s  the dendogram in  accordance wi th  your knowledge?USER:  No.GUHA-80.
May I suggest  another  pat tern  us ing  d i f fe rent  c lus t -e r ing  techn iques?USER: Yes.GUHA-SO: Do you pre fer  some of the  fo l low ing  techn iques :  (atab le  o f  re levant  techn iques  fo l lows)I t  can be eas i ly  seen that  in  such a conversat ion  d i f fe rentleve ls  of  unders tand ing  language are  needed.
NL leve l  w i l l  beappropr ia te  main ly  fo r  user ' s  answers,  s imple  quest ions e tc .But t ry  to  express  the in fo rmat ion  oonta inqd in  the  dend~o-gram in  NL form!
Moreover,  fo r  oommun~cation process  fromGUHA-80 to the  user  i t  w i l l  be typ ica l  a ~raphio representat -i on  of  in fo rmat ion  (which in  many cases  i s  more t ransparentthan ~L one) .Thus the language unders tand ing  take p lace  main ly  in  thecase sub lb) i .e .
when enter ing  suppor t ing  knowledge.
But fo rp rac t i ca l  reasons i t  can be performed in  a very  s imple leve las e .g .
in  very  h igh leve l  programmAng languages .
