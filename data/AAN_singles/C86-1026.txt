The need for MT-or iented versions of Case and Valency in MTHarold L. SomersCentre for Computat ional  L inguist icsUniversity of Manchester  Inst itute of Science & TechnologyABSTRACTThis paper looks at the use in machine Trans lat ionsystems of the l inguist ic models of Case and Valency.It is argued that neither of these models wasor iginal ly developed with this use in mind, and bothmust be adapted somewhat to meet this purpose.
Inpart icular,  the tradit ional  Valency dist inct ion ofcomplements and adjuncts leads to conf l icts whenvalency frames in di f ferent languages are compared: afiner but more f lexible dist inct ion is required.Also, these concepts must be extended beyond theverb, to include the noun and adjective as valencybearers.
As far as Case is concerned, too narrow anapproach has tradit ional ly  been taken: work in thisf ield has been too conerned only with cases forarguments in verb frames; case label systems for non-valency bound elements and also for elements Jnnominal groups must be elaborated.
The papersuggests an integrated approach speci f ical ly  or ientedtowards the part icular  problems found in MT.\ ] .
Introduct ionMost (though not all) MT systems claim to incorporateversions of Valency grammar, and more recent ly  havealso looked to Case grammar.
However, whatevertheory they use is often imported more or lessdirectly, without taking account of the fact that amodel developed for one purpose may not be ent irelyappropriate for another.
This is a less seriousproblem for Valency, though this was or iginal lydesigned with a monol ingual  didactic purpose in mind(see Helbig & Schenkel, 1973:5) rather than themult i l ing~al  needs of translation.
With Casehowever, it is often the much-mal igned and quicklysupereeded Fi l lmore (1968) model which is adopted, orat best a 'consensus' model like that of F i l lmore(1971) or Chafe (1970), loosely extended.
What isnot taken into account is the fact that these modelstypical ly concentrate on 'nuclear' arguments in verb-phrases, saying l itt le about 'peripheral' roles, orabout the structure of nominal or even adject ivalgroups.
This paper will show need for a more task-specif ic model, combining Valency and Case into anintegrated theory for the purposes of translat ion.More specif ical ly,  we will show (a) the need for amore f lexible Valency system with six degrees ofvalency-binding instead of the usual two; (b) theneed for a f inely tuned version of Case to fit thenew version of Valency proposed: in part icular  whatdepth of abstract ion is appropriate; and (c) the needfor this combined Case and Valency model to extendbeyond verbs, especial ly to nominal groups.2.
Valency in exist ing MT sys temsThe essential  notion borrowed from Valency theoryfound in MT is the dist inct ion between 'complements'and 'adjuncts'.
In several MT systems we find thatthe lexicon contains information equivalent to thatgiven in a valency dict ionary like that of Helbig &Schenkel (1973) l ist ing the complements predicted bythe verb together with associated syntactic andsemantic features.
This lexical information is usedin a stra ightforward manner to assist in thecomputat ion of structured representat ions for thesource text, with the complements and adjunctslabel led appropriately.
In this way for example, thefunct ions of the preposi t ions in sentences like (la)and (2a) can be di f ferent iated,  and the correcttranslat ions (ib-2b) arr ived at.la) Er wartet auf seinem Freund.\]b) He is wait ing for his fr iend.2a) Er wafter auf dem Bahnhof.2b) He is wait ing at the station.The ident i f icat ion of complements is useful in thebi l ingual  transfer stage (or equivalent) of the MTsystem, and it is appropr iate at this point toprovide a set of example translat ion pairs (3)-(5)that i l lustrate an important problem that Valency canhelp with.
(3a) He l ikes the girl.
(3b) La fi l le lui plait.4a) The farmer suppl ied the grocer with milk.4b) Le fermier fournit du lait a l '$picier.5a) CharIes entered the'restaurant.
(5b) Charles entra darts le restaurant.Each of the sentence-pairs  in (3)-(5) i l lustrates achange in complement structure between Engl ish andFrench.
The example with l ike and plaire issomething of a classic, involving a double argumentchange; but examples l ike (4) and (5), which, whi leless extreme, are nevertheless typical, suggest thatthe phenomenon is widespread.The Valency approach to this problem recognises eachof the three verb pairs in (3)-(5) as having the samevalency, but as having dif ferent valency patterns,which must be mapped onto each other.In the case of Rothkegel (1976), this mapping isachieved by simpIy juxtaposing the two entries, withequivalent arguments next to each other, roughly asin Figure i.supply Ns (animate) No (animate) Np (with,physobj)fournir  Ns (animate) Ni (animate) No (physobj)Figure i. Valency patterns in Rothkegel (1976)Alternat ively,  in GETA's ARIANE-78 (Vauquois, 1978)and TAUM-Aviat ion (Lehrberger, 1981), the complementsare assigned dist inct ive labels: in both systems thelabel ARG(ument)  is used with a dist inct ive aff ixednumeral,  roughly as in (6).

These are sentencemodif iers,  such as as ment ioned above, indeed, inncontrast to this and so on.Notice that the scope of each type of element is thepredicate plus those elements above it on the scale.Thus, middles pertain to the predicate pluscomplements; adjuncts modi fy  this extendedpredication; extra-per ipherals  range over the entiresentence.4?
How the extended system helps in MTLet us now consider the effect of this concept onmapping of arguments in transfer in MT.
We assumethat the general transfer a lgor i thm has thepossib i l i ty  of correct ly matching complements incorresponding valency patterns (whether by arbi i t rarynumbering, on a verb-by-verb basis, or using Case).We also assume that adjuncts and extra-per ipheralscan be dealt with sat isfactor i ly.
We must nowconsider what to do when, on a bi l ingual  basis,there is some mismatch between the valency bindingsof corresponding elements.
Notice that this is amajor problem in the old two-valued system.Tile most l ikely rea l isat ion of this problem seems tobe as  follows: assume that in a source l anguageanalysis of (8), with a stone has been assigned our'middle' label, whereas in the target language either(i) the equivalent argument is considered to bevalency-bound for the predicate; or (ii) theequivalent argument would be regarded as whol lycircumstantial .
In the case of (i) we can treat theelement as if it had been a complement all along: thevalency pattern for the target verb wil l  tell us whatto do with it.
L ikewise in the case of (ii) we cantreat it as if we always knew it was an adjunct:depending on the nature of the a lgor i thm for treat ingad juncts ,  we  may be  requ i red  to  compute  some morein fo rmat ion  about  i t  ( i t s  case  ro le  fo r  example) ,  butth i s  i s  no  prob lem.It is easy to see that a genera l isat ion of thissolut ion is one in which each degree of valency-binding in Figure 2 is al lowed to map onto eitheritself, or its nearest neighbour in either direct ion.Thus, integral complements and ordinary complementsshould be compatible, as should adjuncts and extra-peripherals.
This blurr ing of the dist inct i ions upand down the hierarchy accords well with intuit ions,which suggest that because the syntactic (andsemantic) behaviour of elements at neighbourdngpoints on the hierarchy have aspects in common,partial  compatibi l i ty  should be achievable.
If weadd, at the very top of the hierarchy, a not ionalempty or 'zero' binding, we are even able to accountfor those cases where a verb plus integral complementin one language is expressed as a simple lexical verbin another, as for example with the Engl ish andFrench pairs in (9):(9 )  take part part ic ipermake a mistake se trompercatch cold s enrhumerwelcome fairs accueilreverse marcher  en arr iSrestroke donner une carcaseProblems would arise if analyses of two languageswere so dif ferent that a complement in one was120regarded as an adjunct in another (though note thatin the current two-value system, this is common), oran integral  mapped onto a middle,  and so on.
Nothingmuch could be done in such a case, and it can only besaid that the single condit ion upon which this systemdepends is that that s i tuat ion simply does not arise.However, there is a second problem aris ing from thequest ion of non-match ing valency patterns, andindeed, this is a problem for which Case seems tooffer a solution.
The problem is this: in languageA, verb V is considered to have two valency-boundarguments,  but in language B, the corresponding verbtakes three complements.
When we come to transferbetween A and B, how do we know which two of thethree complements speci f ied for V in language B maponto the two speci f ied for V in language A?5.
Case in MTCompared to the number of systems using Valency,there are re lat ive ly  few systems that use Case in MT,even though there are a number of problems, as wehave seen, with the bare Valency approach.
Yet Caseobviously has attract ions for MT, especia l ly  due toits character as a bridge between syntax andsemantics.
There is some dispute as to what amountof 'semantics' is needed for successful  t ranslat ion,or indeed whether  Case can properly be descr ibed asbeing part of this ~omain.Nevertheless,  we have seen in the previous sectionsat least two problems which, we suggested, could besolved using Case.
The f irst was the l ike/p la i reexample, wbere we had to have a special mappingalgorithm, whether  between arbitrary ARG labels, orbetween numbered ARG labels interpreted in terms ofsyntactic function.
The point about case labels inthis example is that they will provide a non-arbitrary transfer medium which is intuit ive in bothlanguages.
If we extend the system to make itmult i l ingual ,  the case for Case is even stronger,since it provides a single language-pair  independentmapping in contrast to the necessary n(n-l) (forlanguges) bi l ingual  mappings,  which might, remember,need to be repl icated for almost every verb.
Even inthe problem case above, where analyses required non-neighbour mapping, a solut ion in terms of case labelssuggests that the va lency-b lnding labels can beignored where they do not help us.
And the Casesolut ion to the f inal problem ment ioned above - howto identi fy which arguments are considered in bothlanguages to be va lency-bound - is self -evident.The point about Case is that it exact ly meets theneed in MT for a level of representat ion that is bothdeep enough to serve in a manner  re lat ive lyindependent of surface form, while stil l  beingshal low enough to al low a fair ly stra ightforwardmapping from and onto these other levels ofdescr ipt ion (i.e.
surface syntax, canonical  form,etc.).
This view is countered by Tsuj i i  (1982:382),who claims that with only the shal low meaningrepresentat ion af forded by Case, one does not avoidthe necessi ty to look still at specif ic verbs inorder to interpret the case labels and so todetermine the appropr iate strategy.
But Tsuj i iwrongly attr ibutes to advocates of Case for MT theidea that it should replace other forms of label l ingin the representat ion of analysis.It should be made clear that indeed information aboutsyntact ic conf igurat ion goes hand in hand with casestructure information.
The int roduct ion of caselabels permits certain genera l i sat ions  that can actas defaults to reduce the amount of expl ic i tin format ion associated with each verb, in the mannerof lexical  rules in LFG or metaru les  in GPSG.A l though we may consider F i l lmore's  (1968) not ions ofa case-h ierarchy for subject select ion, or theassociat ion of preposi t ions with cases to beoverstated, this is only because he made the mistakeof posi t ing these as genera l isat ions  rather thandefaults.Of course, Case does introduce new problems, notleast of which is the def in i t ion of a comfortablecase set.
But this is not a design problem, but adevelopment problem, and one would like to bel ievethat the appropr iate case d ist inct ions wil l  becomeevident during a period of exper imentat ion with aprototype system.
Like in any engineer ing (asopposed to theoret ical)  undertak ing,  one must beprepared for a per iod of flux where the appropr iatetools are developed and modif ied.It is appropr iate at this point to look br ief ly  atthe extent to which Case is current ly  used in MTsystems.
Perhaps the most extensive use of Case isfound in LRC's METAL system (Lehmann et al1980).The system is bas ica l ly  t ransfer-based,  with theresults  of a context - f ree parse of the source textpassed to the 'case frame processor ' .
Case framesare also used Jn transfer.
The cases in the systemare divided into two types, 'central.'
and'peripheral ' ,  corresponding roughly to thetradit ional  Valency d ist inct ion between complementsand adjuncts respect ively.A key aspect of the METAL concept ion of central  andper ipheral  cases is that these form two discrete setsof eases.
This means that each of the cases that arerecognized is regarded as either typical ly"condit ioned by the part icular  verb" or not verb-specif ic.
However,  it is reeognised that "... a fewclasses of verbs may be closely assoc iated witharguments which are usual ly  cons idered per ipheral  formost verb classes" (Lehmann et al 1980:1-24),  theexample given being verbs of mot ion which oftenspecify a locat ive complement.Lexieal  entr ies indicate the range of cases for eachverb, for each of which three types ofsubcategor izat ion informat ion are given, as follows:(a) the '~emantic type' of the argument; (b) itscanonical  syntactic role (surface case); (c) thesyntact ic form of the argument, i.e.
the kind ofconst i tuent  expected for each argument,  c.g.
clause,noun-phrase,  prepos i t ional  phrase, adverb.In addit ion, verbs are ass igned to a ' transit iv itytype'.
This feature gives the "potentialconf igurat ion of arguments",  that is, re lat ing thepossible ease roles to the canonical  syntact ic rolesaccording to the mood and voice of the verb.
Thisfeature does add informat ion not expressed elsewhere,even though at f irst sight it would appear only tocorroborate t i le correspondence between deep andsurface caI~e: it is according to t rans i t iv i ty  typethat rules regarding sentence forms other than simpleactive indicat ive can be general ised.In contrast with tradit ional  approaches to Case, notethat requirements  regard ing semantic and syntact icrestr ict ions are not necessar i ly  d irect ly  associatedwith the cases, as was found in F i l lmore's  or iginal(1968) proposal,  but can be speci f ied for individualverbs, though a system of defaults  does apply.The case frame processor attempts to 'use up' theavai lable arguments by matching them to thespeci f icat ions given in the lexical  entry for theverb, and then appl ies general  'case functions'assoc iated with the per ipheral  cases to the remainingarguments.
If all the arguments can be legal lyass igned case roles, then the clause Js consideredwel l - formed.
Otherwise,  tile rule in deemed to havefai led, and an a l ternat ive frame processor  is tried.Case frames are also used in transfer,  pr imari ly  toorder the const i tuents and assign them appropr iatesyntact ic funct ion markers.
Sometimes, if a case is'marked', there might also be a change in syntacticform, most often (presumably) from noun-phrase topreposi t ional  phrase or vice versa.Lack of space prevents us from looking closely at thelist of cases used.
The list of central roles moreor less ref lects  the consensus view.
In addit ion,ful ly 25 major  and addit ional  per ipheral  ro\].es of arather less abstract nature are proposed.Of interest in the documentat ion descr ib ing the caseroles Js that some of them are exempl i f ied in nounframes rather than verb frames (see below).
Morebizarre perhaps is that although these roles areal legedly typical ly  per ipheral ,  many of the examplesgiven show them being used as 'obligatory' arguments,somewhat undermin ing the centra l -per ipherald ist inct ion.
This leads us to our most importantcomment on the METAL system, with regard to thecentra l -per iphera l  dist inct ion.
There is a seriousproblem, if we admit the poss ib i l i ty  of using thesecases also for 'obligatory' roles, of confl ictbetween these more specif ic and the sl ightly moregeneral central cases.
For example, there is anMater ial  case, as in (10a), which would however alsoseem a good al ternat ive candidate to Target(=Patient) for the surface object of use in (iOb).
(10a) John built the wall out of bricks.
(10b) John used bricks to bui ld the wall.My own proposals wil l  show how this kind of problemmight be addressed, in part icular  by making astr icter d is t inct ion between 'central' and'peripheral' cases, though al lowing the latter as'secondary' labels attaching to the former wherenecessary.6.
Valency and Case in MTIn this sect ion I wish to present a synthesised viewof the use of Valency and Case in MT, taking intoaccount the points raised above.
In the fo l lowingdiscussion, I assume a transfer-  rather thaninter l ingua-based approach, in keeping with currentviews on this dichotomy.Remember ing the necess i ty  to keep transfer as smallas possible, we can see the mot ivat ion forintroducing the degree of shal low semantics offeredby Case.
We saw in Sect ion 2 the problems associatedwith transfer based solely on labels d ist inguishingonly between complements and adjuncts.
We have alsoseen in Sect ion 5 how the additional, informat ion12tcarr ied by case labels s impl i f ies the mapping ofarguments i n  transfer.
We should also take  intoconsiderat ion the fact (cf.
Somers, in press) thatall the tradi t ional ly  proposed cases (with theexcept ion of Patient) can occur both as complementsand adjuncts, even simultaneously.
It seemstherefore that the key to transfer  is a labelindicat ing both a case re lat ion and the va lency-binding of that element, so that each const i tuent isuniquely identi f iable.
We also seek to incorporatethe addit ional  va lency-b ind ing values (integral,middle and extra-per ipheral )  introduced in Sect ion 3.For guidance as regards the choice of a set of cases,I would l ike to propose an adaptat ion of the approachfound in METAL (discussed above), where there is astrJ.ct d ist inct ion between the cases used for centraland per ipheral  roles.
We saw in our d iscuss ion abovethat some uneasiness results  from the combinat ion ofgeneral  and specif ic cases, since often both ageneral  (tradit ional) and a specif ic case ass ignmentseems appropriate.
The approach I wish to proposehere involves the def in i t ion of a re lat ive ly  smallset of tradit ional  cases which are assoc iatedpr imari ly  with complements.
The notion 'relat ivelysmall' must of course be expanded.
The cases in thisset wil l  be rather abstract in the manner oftradit ional  cases.
Because they are to be usedessent ia l ly  to d ist inguish va lency-bound elements,and because the maximum possible valency for any verbis probably four, we could argue for having only thatmany of these 'inner cases'.
However,  we also wantto take advantage of the mnemonic value of the casenames, so as to make assignment of case labels (byhumans, perhaps in re lat ive ly  independent researchgroups) as easy as possible.
The number and exactvalues of these cases is to be f ixed by somepre l iminary research, and is not in my v iew an issueof import.
The important point is that this set befixed, i.e.
forming a c losed set, so that one of thecases can be used quite expl ic i t ly  as a 'wastebasket'or neutral  case (cf.
Mellema, 1974) for thoseinstances where there is no obvious case assignment.Judic ious and mot ivated e laborat ion of the case-setwil l  reduce such instances to a minimum.A further range of less abstract cases wil l  serve forthe remaining degrees of va lency-b ind ing - middles,adjuncts and extra-per ipherals .
These wil l  typical lybe more specif ic,  and their character  determined bypart icular  t rans lat ion problems as they arise duringthe development stage of the system.
Somesuggest ions of candidates for this l ist can be foundin the METAL documentat ion.
Given the existence ofthese specif ic cases, it would be quite acceptable  touse them as secondary labels in conjunct ion with thetradit ional  cases (part icular ly,  perhaps, the neutralcase), again as and where necessary or helpful,though their presence would not typical ly  be arequirement for transfer.
They might, for example,be found to be of ass istance in choosing appropr iatesurface structures in generat ion for some targetlanguage, though not for another.There remains the problem of the roles of argumentsin non-verbal  const i tuents,  since these too have adependency structure.
Furthermore,  the recogni t ionof the nature of these relatJ.onships is oftenessential  in translat ion.
Compare the noun groups in(11), all of which have a s imi lar syntact icstructure, but which represent  di f ferent t rans lat ionpatterns in French, depending on the re lat ionsh ip122between the modi f ier  and the head.
(11a) a steam train un train ~ vapeur(111)) a footbal l  pitch un terrain de foot( l l c )  a cot ton  sh i r t  une  chemise  en  coton( l ld )  the  baby  l inen  le  l inge  pour  bSbKA l though i t  cou ld  be  argued that  these  noun-phrasescou ld  be  t reated  as ind iv idua l  compound lex ica \ ]i tems,  the  type  o f  const ruc t ion  they  exempl i fy  istyp ica l ,  w idespread ,  and  such  ' compounds '  occurfreely in novel combinat ions,  often involv ing alarger number of elements (12):(12a) the Geneva peace talks(12b) SDP elect ion campaign promises(12c) North Sea oil.
f ield of fshore r ig admin is t rat ionThese pose considerable problems when they aretranslated into languages in which such opaquecompounds cannot be formed and where there lat ionships between the elements are made moreexplicit .
Therefore,  these re lat ionships must berepresented at i nput  to transfer.
Indeed this hasbeen recognised as a problem in t rans lat ion (human ormechanical ) ,  and Case suggested as a descr ipt ivemechanism for such structures (e.g.
Bauer, 1978;Mackenzie,  1983).
.
My own approach would be topropose that the case set be supplemented by a numberof re lat ions speci f ica l ly  su i ted  to noun groups:these would be compat ib le with the cases alreadyestabl ished, with as large an overlap as possible.Clearly, in the case of complex noun groups whosehead is der ived from a verb, either as a directnominal isat Jon (13a), as a cognate form (14a) or evenperhaps when the l ink is essent ia l ly  semantic (15a),there is no reason why the range of cases (andvalency bindings) that would apply in thecorresponding verbal predicat ions (13b, 14b, 15b)could not be employed within the noun group.
(13a) the possib le future dismissal  of teachers forincompetence(13b) Teachers wil l  possib ly be d ismissed in futurefor incompetence.
(14a) my mother 's  temporary loss of memory(14b) My mother  has temporar i ly  lost her memory.
(15a) Everton's  recent 6-1 home victory over Arsenal(15b) Everton recent ly  beat Arsenal  by 6-1 at home.By the same token, nouns not so re lated to verbs mustbe seen as heads with arguments in some relat ion.Work on nominal  valency (e.g.
Sommerfeldt  &Schreiber,  1977; Teubert,  1979) has recognised thatmany nouns can be att r ibuted 'valency patterns' ,  andPi~ha (1980) and Mackenzie  (1983) have taken a Caseapproach to the problem.
Among their f indings is theobservat ion that whi le almost no nouns takeobl igatory complements,  many noun modi f iers  can beregarded as va lency-bound (e .g .
the noun book  hascomplements indicat ing author, subject and contents,s ignal led by by, about and of  respect ive ly) .Furthermore,  there are a number of case- l ikerelat ions that are appropr iate for noun modif iers ,among them almost certa in ly  an essent ia l ly  nentra\]one, for use - in the context of MT - when thereturns out to be no need to compute the reJat ionship:atLr ihut ive adject ives may be an example of this.It is not my intent ion here to establ ish,  discuss andjustify such  a set of rela~.ions.
In any case, on lyby extensJ ve research and exper imentat ion with aworking sys t, em could sne expect be be ab\] e todiscover the range of relat ions needed.7.
Conc lus ionIt has been the :intent\]on of th:is paper to nlake as ta tement  about  t i l e  p roper  approach  to  the  use  o fcase and Va lency  J.n MT.
On tile one ha l ld ,  I havepresented a proposal to abandon the old two-~JermValency system ill favour of a new six-term system,and have explored the consequences of such a change.In connect ion with this, I have tried to show whereCase fits in.
What this research perhaps lacks atthis point in time is empirical evidence that such anapproach is valid, and an accompany:ing set of casenames for the various relations.
It could be arguedthat t l le latter is a prerequis i te for the former,though I would prefer to claim that the demonstrat ionof the val id i ty of the approach and the elaborat ionof a 'comfortable' set of cases form an essenl;iallyun i f : ied  research task.
