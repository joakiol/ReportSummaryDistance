V~TJ~CY AND MT: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE METAL  SYSTEMRudi GebruersS iemens-METAL projectKathol ieke Univers i te i t  LeuvenMar ia Theresiastraat  21B-3000 LEUVENBELGIUMABSTRACTThis paper  descr ibes a valency model,developed wi th in  the Belg ian METAL project,a imed at enhanc ing the modular i ty  andmult i l ingua l i ty  of the METAL system.
Theintroduct ion provides background, sect ion 1d iscusses the ex is t ing valency framework, andsect ion 2 presents the a l ternat ive model.The final sect ion deals with some results andproblems with this model.0.
Int roduct ionThe task of MT is to map between equivalentl inguist ic  objects.
One of the central  designquest ions in MT is that of the best method todecompose the t rans lat ion relation.
The idealwould be to have a system that produces a(natural) language- independent  representat ionfrom a source language (SL) text, which couldthen be synthes ized in any target language(TL).
However, this ideal not being feasiblefor rea l -wor ld  texts, it has become customaryto adopt a model where a transfer  module,speci f ic  to one language pair, def ines amapping between language-dependent  structuralrepresentat ions.
In pr inc ip le it should beposs ib le to des ign a 'transfer' model in sucha way that the analysis module for mappingsurface str ings onto structuralrepresentat ions and the synthesis module formapping structural  representat ions ontosurface strings remain the same, regardless ofthe TL and SL, respectively.
The advantage ofthis 'mult i l ingual '  design is that ex ist ingmodules wil l  not be ser iously af fected by theaddit ion of a new language to the system.
Astill more attractive, but also moreambitious, design would be one in which thesame grammar can be used for both pars ing andgenerating, and the same translat ion rules fort rans lat ing between two languages in eitherd i rect ion (see J in and Simmons, 1986 for anexample of a 'symmetric' t rans lat ion system).Whereas early MT systems blended the rulesof grammar and the analysis procedure foref f ic iency reasons, it has also becomecustomary, given current system opt imizat iontechniques, to make a clear separat ion betweenprogramming logic and data on the one hand,and l inguist ic  logic and data on the other.This separat ion is convenient  for the div is ionof labour between the l inguist and theprogrammer, and it enables the former torevise and complete his rule systems withoutthe latter  hav ing to constant ly  change hisprograms.The METAL automatic  t rans lat ion system triesto be mult i l ingual  in the above sense.
More-over, it makes an attempt at separat ing soft-ware and l ingware (= l inguist ic  knowledgewr i t ten in a specia l ised user  language).
Inthe following, I wil l  show how the adopt ion ofa new k ind of va lency framework, developed atthe K.U.Leuven in the course of the last twoyears, enhances the mul t i l ingua l i ty  andmodular i ty  even further.
For the sake ofclarity, I wi l l  f irst review the relevantaspects of the va lency framework in thecurrent METAL system.I.
Va lency  in the METAL systemSince the main c la im to be advanced in thispaper bears on the relat ion between a valencyframework and the general  design of an MTsystem, I wil l  f irst say a few words on theMETAL system architecture.
I wil l  then reviewand comment upon the va lency framework in thissystem.i.I.
The METAL arch i tecturoIn METAL the t rans lat ion process proceeds inthree phases.
Dur ing the analysis phase aninput sentence is mapped onto one or moreinterpretat ions.
Each interpretat ion isrepresented as a f lattened phrase structure,cons ist ing of a predicate node fo l lowed by oneor more arguments (and zero or moremodif iers).
Anaphor ic  l inks are resolveddur ing the integration phase.
The result inganalysis trees are not intended to belanguage- independent  representat ions,  but arepassed to a b i l ingual  transfer phase.
Duringtransfer, analysis trees are structura l ly  andlexical ly modi f ied  according to TLspecif icat ions.
The output sentence is thestr ing of terminal nodes of this t ransformedtree.168The METAL  sys tem accommodates  two k inds  oft rans fer /generat ion  approaches .
Most  t rans ferins t ruct ions  are pa i red  one- to -one  w i th  thegrammar  ru les  used  to per fo rm the SL ana lys is .However ,  p rov is ions  have a lso been  made tocomplement  th is  "d i rect  t ransfer '  approachw i th  an independent  t rans fer  g rammar  (seeRoot, 1985).
The la t te r  approach  is becomingmore  and  more  impor tant  in METAL  because  itg reat ly  enhances  the modu lar i ty  of the sys tem(viz.
w i th  an eye on us ing  it for  severa ld i f fe rent  language pa i rs ) .1.2o The valency frameworkIt is we l l -known that  the dependency  re la t ionsbetween a verb  and i ts  a rguments  can in f luencegreat ly  the lex ica l  and  s t ruc tura l  t rans fer  ofboth, as we l l  as the s t ruc tura l  t rans fer  ofthe c lause  as a whole .
Though the dependencyre la t ions  themse lves  may be language-independent ,  the i r  encod ing  var ies  f rom onelanguage to another ,  and, w i th in  one language,f rom one verb  to another .
It is there foreessent ia l  to know for  each  verb  what  itsdependents  shou ld  look  l ike.
This  top icbe ing  cent ra l  in Va lency  Grammar,  it is notsurpr i s ing  that many MT sys tems (e.g.TAUM-AVIAT ION,  SUSY, GETA, AR IANA-78 ,  EUROTRA)incorporate  va lency  not ions  (see Somers,1986).
One essent ia l  not ion  bor rowed f romva lency  theory  is that  of ' va lency  frame',i.e.
a pat tern  l i s t ing  al l  the complementsa l lowed and/or  requ i red  by a verb, togetherw i th  assoc ia ted  morpho-syntact i c  and/orsyntact i c  features .S ince  German-Eng l i sh  is the fur thestdeve loped language pa i r  of  METAL  at present ,  Iw i l l  now d iscuss  what  the va lency  f rames lookl ike  for  German.
In the METAL  sys tem theGerman va lency  f rames  main ly  inc ludemorpho-syntact i c  in fo rmat ion  (syntact ic(sub) category  and/or  sur face  case) w i threspect  to non-sub jec t  a rguments .
Forinstance,  the pat tern  (A-X (CP TH)) s igna lsthat  a German verb  car ry ing  it may  take,bes ides  a nominat ive  subject,  an accusat ivere f lex ive  pronoun (A-X) plus  a complementphrase  in t roduced by dass  (CP TH).
Theopt iona l i ty  of a rguments  is not s igna l led  inthe f rame itsel f ,  but in a separate  feature  onthe verba l  p red icate .In analys is ,  pred icate -argument  s t ructures ,resu l t ing  f rom a f la t ten ing  and rear rangementof const i tuent  s t ructures ,  are passed  to acase f rame processor .
The la t te r  a t tempts  to'use up' the ava i lab le  sentence  const i tuentsby match ing  them aga ins t  the argumentspec i f i ca t ions  in the va lency  frame(s)spec i f ied  for  the  verba l  p red icate .
When itf inds a const i tuent  that  matches  an argumentspec i f i ca t ion  in the frame, it updates  th isconst i tuent  w i th  a grammat ica l  role (SUBJECT,( IN)DIRECT OBJECT,  etc.)
accord ing  to somegenera l  imp l i ca t ion  re la t ion  ho ld ing  betweengrammat ica l  ro les  and case mark ings  (or someother  sort  of  cod ing) .
For  a c lause  to bewe l l - fo rmed,  at least  one of  i ts  verb 's  f ramesmust  have  a ' f i l ler"  for  each  of  its a rgument's lots ' .
I f  a f rame is found to be app l i cab lein more  than one way, p re ference  is g iven  toone app l i ca t ion  on the  bas is  of word  orderc r i te r ia  and/or  semant ic  p roper t ies  of thesubject  argument .
Eventua l ly ,  the case f rameprocessor  re turns  e i ther  an ana lys i s  t ree  thathas been  updated  w i th  grammat ica l  ro lein format ion ,  or it d i scards  the inputsentence.Dur ing  the t rans fer  phase,  morpho-syntact i cin fo rmat ion  of  the sort  p resent  in va lencyf rames may be used, both  in tes ts  and int rans format ions  assoc ia ted  w i th  lex ica lt rans fer  entr ies ,  to a t tune  SL argumentspec i f i ca t ions  to the TL.
In addi t ion,t rans fer  ent r ies  may conta in  fur thersemant ico -syntact i c  res t r i c t ions  on argumentpos i t ions ,  wh ich  may he lp  in choos ing  ther ight t rans la t ion  for  a verb.
The grammat ica lro les  are used  to conver t  the canon ica lo rder ing  of  the t rans la t ions  of the verb  andits a rguments  into  the appropr ia te  TLorder ing,  as we l l  as to generate  theappropr ia te  forms of  the TL const i tuents .1.3.
D iscuss ionBefore  d i scuss ing  the new, extended va lencyf ramework,  we wi l l  b r ie f ly  po int  out how theex is t ing  sys tem does  not yet exp lo i t  thepotent ia l  of a va lency  grammar  to the full.The on ly  va lency  f rames  re fer red  to by thecase f raming  package  in the course  oft rans la t ion  are SL va lency  frames.
There  is noprocedure  for mapp ing  SL f rames onto TLframes, and  the in fo rmat ion  prov ided  in TLf rames is not used  when TL s t r ings  aregenerated .
The under ly ing  assumpt ion  seems tobe that  a rgument  s t ruc tures  are more  or  lessthe same across  languages .
Any d isc repanc iesw i th  respect  to the argument  s t ruc ture  arereso lved  by means  of  a smal l  set oft rans format ions  spec i f ied  in the re levantlex ica l  t rans fer  ent r ies .
Any  d i sc repanc iesw i th  respect  to the express ion  of the arguments t ruc ture  (e.g case-marked  vs. unmarked  NPs)are hand led  in the re levant  grammar  rules.The assumpt ion  that  a rgument  s t ruc tures  aremore  or less the same across  languages  is a lsore f lec ted  in the s ta tus  of the canon ica lc lause  representat ions  employed  in theMETAL  system.
The la t te r  are cons idered  tobe some sort of in ter l ingua l  s t ruc tures  f romwh ich  TL sur face  s t r ings  are to be generatedd i rec t ly  (cf.
the d i rec t  t rans fer  approach) .However,  the genera l  ph i losophy  in theMETAL  sys tem has been to start  off  w i th  ara ther  'shal low'  level  of analys is ,  ratherthan a 'deep representat ion '  of some sort  (see\ [SLOCUM 83\]).
Thus, there  seems to be aconf l i c t  between the re luc tance  to work  wi th  amore  semant ica l ly  o r iented  ana lys i s  and thedes i re  to have an in ter l ingua .
Th is  conf l i c tmay have  been neg l ig ib le  for theGerman-Eng l i sh  system, because  these  languagesare 'cut' a long  very  s imi la r  pat terns .Never the less ,  even these  two languages  d i sp laysubt le  d i f fe rences  as to the way they 'model'169ext ra l ingu is t i c  rea l i ty .
For  instance,'he lp ing'  is a rea l -wor ld  re la t ionsh ipinvo lv ing  two ent i t ies ,  A and B.
In Engl ish,th is  re la t ionsh ip  is const rued  as an ac t ion  ofA wh ich  a f fec ts  B (A he lps  B is s imi la r  to Ah i ts  B); in German,  it is mode l led  as i f  At rans fer red  someth ing  to B (A \[nom\] h i l f t  B\[dat\] is s imi la r  to A \[nom\] gibt  B \[dat\] C\[acc\]).
S imi la r  d i f fe rences  may be expected  toinc rease  as languages  more  d ivergent  thanEng l i sh  and German are  to be hand led .
If, forsome reason  or  other,  it is not  feas ib le  ordes i rab le  to reduce  language-spec i f i c  mode lsof some rea l -wor ld  re la t ionsh ip  to a language-independent  case  frame, there  is noth ing  butto s ta te  t rans la t ion  equ iva lences  betweenc lause  s t ruc tures  in te rms of  equ iva lencesbetween l anguage-dependent  arguments t ruc tures .

The  l ingu is t i c  fundamenta ls  o f  thea l te rnat ive  va lency  f rameworkThe bas ic  assumpt ion  is that  s imp le  c lauseshave  a pred icat iona l  s t ruc ture  and  that(partial) equ iva lences  between SL and  TLc lauses  can be de f ined  in te rms of  (partial)equ iva lences  between SL and  TL  pred icat ions .The s t ruc tura l  cent re  of  a p red icat ion  is alex ica l  p red icate  w i th  wh ich  one or  moreva lency  f rames  are assoc ia ted .

the doso and und zwar  tests,  for  Eng l i sh  and German,respect ive ly ) ,  as wel l  as d i s t r ibut iona l  andsubst i tu t iona l  c r i te r ia  (e.g.
sats  are f reerto move than args, whereas  e lements  ofp ronomina l  parad igms subst i tu te  more  eas i lyfor  args  than  for sats).
Whenever  those  tes tsare not dec is ive  w i th  respect  to the s ta tus  ofa sentence  const i tuent ,  the la t te r  is assumedto be an arg, since, for  t ransfer ,  it isa rguab le  that  it is eas ie r  to operate  on argsthan on sats.Argument  s lo ts  may be ob l igatory  oropt iona l .
Opt iona l  slots, wh ich  need not bepresent ,  but  are a lways  semant ica l ly  impl ied,are set apart  f rom ob l igatory  ones by means  ofthe symbol  OPT.
In fact, OPT  is a means  toco l lapse  f rames  whose  ob l igatory  s lo ts  areident ica l  and whose  opt iona l  s lots  are notmutua l ly  exc lus ive .
Thus, a f rame conta in ingn opt iona l  s lo ts  is an abbrev ia t ion  for 2expnd i f fe rent  frames.Argument  s lots  are  not  in themse lveslabe l led  semant ica l ly ,  though they  do t ie upw i th  semant ic  re la t ions  (deep cases) as allva lency  re la t ions  are u l t imate ly  semant ica l lymot ivated .

However,  far f rom be ingarb i t rary ,  the inventory  of  arg labe ls  shou ldbe jus t i f ied  both  language- in terna l ly  andc ross - l ingu is t i ca l ly .
Language-internal ly,th is  means  that one has to come up  w i th  anumber  of  ind icat ions  that  a g iven  arg  labela l lows  for  s ign i f i cant  language-spec i f i cgenera l i za t ions .
Cross-l inguistical ly,  th ismeans  that, in ass ign ing  the same label  tos lots  in d i f fe rent  languages,  it must  beposs ib le  to reveal  a reasonab le  degree  ofover lap  in the behav iour  of  f i l l e rs  for thes lots  in the respect ive  languages .
Of  course,we do not p re tend  that  our l ist  of  a rg  labe lsis in any way  exhaust ive  and we grant  that itmay  have  to be ad jus ted  in the l ight  offu r ther  research.Apar t  f rom a slot label,  an argument  s lotconta ins  a number  of  'keys' wh ich  re fer  toprocedures ,  f rame tes ts  and f rameconst ructors ,  to be ca l led  dur ing  ana lys i s  andsynthesis ,  respect ive ly .Frame tests cons is t  of morpho-syntact i c  and,poss ib ly ,  semant ic  cond i t ions  wh ichconst i tuents  must  sa t i s fy  in order  to becomepotent ia l  s lot  f i l lers .
The actua l  contents  ofthe morpho-syntact i c  const ra in ts  isco -determined  by such parameters  as the s lotlabel  and the c lause 's  Mood and Vo ice  va lues.Regard ing  the use  of  semant ic  se lec t ionres t r i c t ions ,  a fa i r l y  p ragmat ic  course  hasbeen  pursued.

Again,  the actua lcontent  of  the ins t ruct ions  is co -determinedby such parameters  as the  s lot  label  and thec lause 's  Mood and Vo ice  values,  as wel l  as bylex ica l  in fo rmat ion  prov ided  in the slot.It is impor tant  to note  two th ings.
First ,it is ac tua l ly  the  same codes  that  are usedfor both  tes ts  (Analysis) and const ructors(Synthesis) .
The sys tem knows f rom thet rans la t ion  phase  whether  it has  to in terpretthe code as a test  or as a const ructor .Second, both  f rame tes ts  and f rameconst ructors  are s tored  in separate  f i les, inorder  to enhance  the modu lar i ty  of thel ingware.
However ,  they  are wr i t ten  in thesame format  as o rd inary  grammar  rules, and aspec ia l  in ter face  for loading,  inspect ing  anded i t ing  these  procedures  has  been  deve loped,so that they can be easi ly accessed andupdated by the linguist.As an i l lus t ra t ion  of  the above, let uscons ider  the fo l low ing  ( incomplete) l ist  ofva lency  f rames wh ich  occur  as e lements  in ava lue  l i s t  to the feature  ARGS for the verbfaire:((($0 N1 PI) ($I N1 P0)OPT ($2 N1 P1 (PREP pour))) :'make"(($0 NI)($5 A)) :'look"(($0 NI)($3 MEA)) :'do")What  is sa id  here is that  faire can show up in(at least) th ree  d i f fe rent  frames.

Dur ing  ana lys i s ,  the  va lencyprocedure  is invoked f rom wi th in  grammar  ru lesfor  bu i ld ing  c lausa l  s t ruc tures  of  thefo l low ing  fo rmat :<clausal category>ARGI PRED ARG2 .'..
ARGn<ARGS>Given  a verb  w i th  a set  o f  va lency  f rames  anda set  o f  sentence  const i tuents ,  th i s  p rocedurehas  to  make sure  that  one  o f  these  f rames  isrea l i zed  in  the  sentence  at i ssue ,  and, if  so,171it has  to make c lear  how that  f rame isrea l i zed .
It w i l l  take  a f rame to be rea l i zedin a tree, i f  and  on ly  if each  of the  f rame'snon-opt iona l  s lots,  and  poss ib ly ,  one or moreof its opt iona l  s lots,  is matched by at leastone sentence  const i tuent .
I f  the sys temf inds a match ing  frame, it w i l l  u l t imate lyre turn  a t ree  s t ruc ture  in wh ich  each  of  theva lency-bound const i tuents  is marked  for as lot  and  whose  root  node  conta ins  a re ferenceto the match ing  frame.Now, the genera l  idea  is to have theprocedure  look  for  the  most  ambi t ious  f ramematch ing  the t ree  s t ructure ,  as we l l  as forthe best  rea l i za t ion  of th is  f rame in thest ructure,  wh i le  avo id ing  super f luousprocess ing  as much as poss ib le .
This  imp l iesthat  two k inds  of p re ference  mechan isms had  tobe in t roduced in the va lency  procedure :  oneto choose  the  best  cand idate  f rom a set ofpotent ia l  f i l l e rs  for  a g iven  s lot  ( instead ofa lways  choos ing  the  f i rst  const i tuent  match ingthe spec i f i ca t ions  of that  slot), and one tochoose  the most  ambi t ious  f rame f rom a set ofsuccess fu l  f rames  ( instead of  a lways  choos ingthe f i rst  f rame that  matches  a g iven  ana lys i stree).The f i rst  p re ference  mechan ism isimp lemented  in the fo l low ing  way.
Whencheck ing  whether  a f rame matches  the tree, theva lency  procedure  co l lec ts  for each  slot  ($ikey l .
.
.
keyN)  all sentence  const i tuents  wh ichpass  al l  the f rame tes ts  assoc ia ted  w i th  thekeys  in that  slot.
Fur thermore ,  in the ac t ionpart  of  f rame tests,  each  potent ia l  f i l l e rgets  a number  ind icat ing  the probab i l i ty  thatth is  const i tuent  wi l l  be taken  as the u l t imatef i l l e r  for a slot.
As  the l ingu is t  can eas i lya l te r  th is  number,  he has  s ign i f i cant  cont ro lover  the ass ignment  of  const i tuents  to slots.The actua l  ass ignment  procedure  is fa i r lyeconomica l  and  runs as fo l lows.
Wheneverthere  is on ly  one potent ia l  f i l l e r  for  a s lot(which may be e i ther  an ob l igatory  or  anopt iona l  one), th is  const i tuent  loses itsmark ing  as a cand idate  f i l l e r  for o ther  slots,if it was  one.
Fur thermore ,  it is marked  asthe on ly  remain ing  f i l l e r  for  the s lot  that  isbe ing  matched.
A s ide -e f fec t  of th ismark ing  may be that  one of the other  s lotsw i l l  now have  on ly  one cand idate  f i l ler .
Inthat  case, the la t te r  const i tuent  wi l l  bemarked  as the actua l  f i l l e r  for that  slot andlose i ts  mark ing  as a potent ia l  f i l le r  forst i l l  o ther  slots, if it was  one.
Th is  mayagain  cause the number  of potent ia l  f i l l e rsfor  yet  another  s lot  to be reduced to one, inwh ich  case the above mark ing  (and unmark ing)p rocedure  s tar ts  over  again.
If, eventua l ly ,there  is more  than  one potent ia l  f i l l e r  for  aslot, the procedure  takes  the le f tmostcand idate  wh ich  rece ived  the h ighest  p re fer -ence va lue  for the s lot  in the f rame tests .The second pre ference  mechan ism is fa i r lyeconomica l  as wel l .
The genera l  assumpt ion  isthat, in o rder  to f ind  the most  'ambit ious 'frame, one shou ld  look for the f rame wh ich  hasthe largest  number  of s lots  real ized.
Inorder  to avo id  super f luous  process ing ,  we letthe more  complex  f rames (i.e.
the ones w i ththe la rger  number  of slots, whether  ob l igatoryor opt ional )  p recede  the less  complex  ones inthe ARGS va lue  of a verb.
Consequent ly ,  thesys tem comes across  the fo rmer  be fore  it seesthe lat ter .
Whenever  two or  more  a l te rnat ivef rames happen to have  the same number  ofslots, the lex icographer  has  to determine(e.g., on the  bas is  of f requency  ofoccur rence)  wh ich  f rame to t ry  f i rst .
G iventhat  the sys tem has  found a match ing  frame, itw i l l  on ly  exp lore  an a l te rnat ive  f rame if  thenumber  of (opt ional  and  non-opt iona l )  s lotsconta ined  in the  a l te rnat ive  f rame outnumbersthe number  of  s lo ts  found to be rea l i zeddur ing  the match ing  of the  f i rst  frame.
Ana l te rnat ive  f rame wi l l  be  pre fer red  on ly  whenit has  more  s lots  rea l i zed  than  the prev iousmatch ing  frame.2.3 .2 .
Dur ing  t ransfer ,  s ince we takeargument  s t ruc tures  to be language-spec i f i cent i t ies ,  the va lency  procedure  has toaccompl i sh  two tasks.
F i rst ,  it has todetermine  wh ich  TL  f rame cor responds  w i th  theSL f rame that  has been  found to be app l i cab leto the ana lys i s  tree.
Secondly ,  it has tospec i fy  wh ich  s lots  in the TL f rame cor respondw i th  wh ich  s lo ts  in the SL  frame.
It per fo rmsthose  tasks  in the fo l low ing  way.F irst ,  the mechan ism looks  up al l  thet rans fers  for the SL  verba l  p red icate .
Eachof the  verba l  t rans fer  ent r ies  descr ibes  at rans i t ion  between the SL verb  w i th  one of itsframes, and an equ iva lent  TL verb  wi th  one ofits f rames.
It does so in te rms of (a) condi -t ions  on the t rans i t ion  and  (b) (poss ib lypart ia l )  mappings  between SL s lots  and TLslots.
The cond i t ion  par t  of a verba l  t rans ferent ry  may be empty  or  take  any of the fo l low-ing forms, for  d i sambiguat ion  w.r .
t ,  the TL:(a) a test  on the presence  (absence) of someslot f i l l e r  in (from) the SL tree;(b) a test  on the presence  (absence) ofcer ta in  lex ica l  or g rammat ica l  in fo rmat ionon some s lot  f i l l e r  in (from) the SL tree;(c) a test  on the presence  (absence) of somefeature  on (from) the root  node of the SLtree.As for the mapp ings  between SL s lots  and TLslots, three  poss ib i l i t i es  have been cateredfor so far:(a) SL s lot  maps  onto  TL s lot.
In th is  case,we only  s tate  cont ras t ive  in fo rmat ionwh ich  is s t r i c t ly  necessary  to e f fect  anappropr ia te  mapp ing  between SL s lots  andTL slots.
That  is, in General ,equ iva lences  between d is t inc t  slot labe lswi l l  suf f ice,  though add i t iona lin fo rmat ion  may be prov ided  ford i sambiguat ion .
(b) SL s lot  w i thout  TL counterpar t .
Again,on ly  min ima l  in fo rmat ion  needs  to bespec i f ied  in order  to ident i fy  the SL slotwhose  f i l l e r  must  be removed f rom the t reest ructure.
(c) TL s lot  w i thout  SL counterpar t .
Here, thecoder  shou ld  be able  to descr ibe  thein terna l  s t ruc ture  of a TL const i tuent  tobe c reated  at c lause  level  in the t reest ructure.
At  the moment,  thefunct iona l i ty  p rov ided  is l im i ted  to thec reat ion  of new TL nodes  w i thout  in terna ls t ructure .173Hav ing  re t r ieved  al l  the  t rans fers  for theSL verb, the sys tem reduces  the potent ia lt rans fer  ambigu i ty  o f  a SL  verb  in two steps.It f i rst  d i scards  any t rans fers  for wh ich  notal l  cond i t ions  are  fu l f i l l ed .
A f te rwards ,  itchecks  wh ich  of the remain ing  t rans fer  ent r ies(there shou ld  be at least  one) p rov ides  af rame equ iva lence  whose  ' le f t -hand side" canbe l inked  to the  f rame rea l i zed  in the  SLtree.
Once th is  equ iva lence  has  been  found,the  TL  f rame matched by  the  ' r ight -hand side'of the f rame equ iva lence  wi l l  be  subst i tu tedfor the  SL f rame re ferenced  by a feature  onthe root  node  of  the  tree.
At  th i s  stage,nodes  can be pruned f rom or added to the t rees t ructure ,  i f  l ex ica l  ins t ruct ions  te l l  thesys tem to do so.F ina l ly ,  a f te r  t rans la t ion  of  the verba lp red icate ,  the  sys tem exp lo i t s  theequ iva lences  between SL s lo ts  and  TL  s lots  ino rder  to determine  how the t rans la t ions  of  thesentence- leve l  const i tuents  fit into  the s lotsof  the TL  frame.The above  match ing  procedure  compl ica tes  thelex icographer ' s  task  cons iderab ly  (see sect ion3.
for how we t ry  to remedy th i s  s i tuat ion) .Th is  is because  it requ i res  that  verba lt rans fer  ent r ies  be wr i t ten  in such a way  thateach  of  them prov ides(a) a l ink  w i th  a SL verb  and exact ly  one ofi ts  f rames;(b) a l ink  w i th  a TL verb  and exact ly  one ofi ts  f rames;(c) su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  concern ing  the s lotequ iva lences  ho ld ing  between these  twof rames.On the o ther  hand, it has  the  advantage  ofg iv ing  the d ic t ionary  wr i te r  s ign i f i cantcont ro l  over  verba l  and  c lausa l  t rans fer .2.3.3.
The task  of  the  va lency  proceduredur ing  synthesis, as we conce ived  of it,cons is ts  in gu id ing  the generat ion  of theappropr ia te  sur face  form of va lency-boundsentence  const i tuents .
Fur thermore ,  thesynthes is  component  conta ins  const i tuento rder ing  procedures  wh ich  may re fer  to s lotlabe ls  in o rder  to rear range  the canon ica lc lause  s t ruc ture  in to  the  appropr ia te  TLorder ing .F irst ,  the  va lency  procedure  re t r ieves  theTL - f rame f rom the root of the  tree.
For  eachslot  conta ined  in th is  frame, it then checkswhether  it conta ins  any lex ica l  in fo rmat ionspec i f i c  to the TL verb  and  the f rame that  areat i ssue  (e.g., the th i rd  (optional)  slot inthe f i rst  f rame of  faire has  to be f i l l ed  by aprepos i t iona l  phrase  in t roduced by pour) andmakes  th is  in fo rmat ion  ava i lab le  for  fu r therp rocess ing .
Next, it ca l l s  al l  of the  f rameconst ructors  assoc ia ted  w i th  the keys  in theslot.
Dur ing  those  ca l l s  the re levantsentence  const i tuents  wi l l  be mod i f ied  andupdated  accord ing  to the ins t ruct ions  that  thel ingu is t  spec i f ied  in the const ructors .Eventua l ly ,  the va lency  procedure  shou ldre turn  a t ree  al l  of whose  va lency-boundconst i tuents  conta in  su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  sothat  morphological  ru les  and l inear i za t ionru les  can generate  the  appropr ia te  TL formsand const i tuent  o rder ing  (the la t te r  ru les  mayoccas iona l ly  a l te r  the const i tuents '  forms).Again,  the l ingu is t  has  s ign i f i cant  cont ro lover  the generat ion  process  as he can eas i lyspec i fy  and  update  the contents  of  both  f rameconst ructors  and  l inear i za t ion  ru les.3.
Rem.z l te  ~"*d Prob l~In the  last  year, the  a l te rnat ive  va lencyf ramework  presented  in th is  paper  has  beenapp l ied  to the t rans la t ion  of  Dutch  intoFrench,  and  v ice  versa .
Though the  app l i ca t ionhas  been  l im i ted  to "kerne l "  sentences ,  i .e.s imp le  ac t ive  and  pass ive  dec la ra t ivesentences  (poss ib ly  conta in ing  re la t ivec lauses  of  the  same type),  the resu l t s  seemfa i r ly  p romis ing .
At  the  moment ,  p rov is ionsare be ing  made to hand le  non- f in i teva lency-bound subc lauses .In the meant ime,  smal l  convers ionexper iments  have  been conducted  for  thelanguage pa i rs  German-Eng l i sh  (at K .U .Leuven)and German-Span ish  (at CDS Barce lona) .
Theseexper iments  have  shown that, at least  for  theadmi t ted ly  very  l im i ted  domain  of app l i ca t ion ,the Leuven va lency  f ramework  works  very  wel l .I ts  ma in  advantages  seem to be the fo l low-ing:(a) it p rov ides  the  ske le ton  for  a rea l lyt rans fer -based  MT system, s ince  it c lear lyseparates  th ree  subprocedures  to beinvoked dur ing  Ana lys i s ,  T rans fer ,  andSynthes is ,  respect ive ly ;(b) it a l lows  for a neat  separat ion  of  kerne lso f tware  and  app l i ca t ion -spec i f i c  l ingwareand prov ides  user - f r iend ly  fac i l i t i es  toaccess  and  update  the  la t ter ;(c) its methodo log ica l  underp inn ing  to acer ta in  extent  a l lows  languages  to bet reated  independent ly  of one another .Because  of  these  advantages ,  the Leuvenva lency  f ramework  has  recent ly  been  adopted  byall s i tes  of the  METAL  pro jec t .However ,  ser ious  prob lems remain  to betack led,  w i th  respect  to both  lex icon  cod ingand grammat ica l  pars ing .
The f i rst  k ind  ofp rob lems can be t raced  to the  r ig id i ty  of thef rame mapp ing  schema i tse l f .
As has  beenpo in ted  out in sect ion  2.3.2. ,  the mainrequ i rement  for  f rame mapp ing  to be poss ib leis that  verb  lex icons  be coded cons is tent lyacross  languages .
Th is  may indeed bepro f i tab le  in an exper imenta l  env i ronment .However ,  it is doubt fu l  whether  we can expectthe average  end  user  to have  both  source,target,  and  t rans fer  cod ings  in mind  at thesame t ime and to make sure that  no aspect  ofthe mapp ing  between f rames  is over looked .There fore ,  we have  deve loped prov is iona lre laxat ions  on the r ig id  schema to the extentthat  at least  the mandatory  s lots  of the TLf rame must  have  a counterpar t  in the SL frame.Eventua l ly ,  however ,  it may  turn  out to bemore  e f fec t ive  not to have  these  re laxat ionsat run time, but  to sort  out incons is tenc iesbetween verba l  lex icons  at cod ing  t ime.174The second k ind  of p rob lems (among wh ich  thenotor ious  d i f f i cu l t  p rob lem of PP -a t tachment )has  to do w i th  a need  for st i l l  g reaterfunct iona l i ty  in the system.
