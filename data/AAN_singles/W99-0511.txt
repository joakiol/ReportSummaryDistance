LADL (Laboratoire d'AutomatlqueDocumentaire et LmgmstIque) It includesmonohngual hngulstlc resources (mainly forFrench and English) specifically elaborated to beintegrated into NLP systems Standard methodsand formats-have been defined and are now usedby other national teams working on their ownlanguages German, Greek, Italian, Portugueseand Spanish Within that common framework,important fragments of the descnptmn of thelanguages involved have been worked out thesyntactic and semantic properties of free andfrozen sentences are descnbed and formalized e~sfor the lexicon, a major component of NLP, largecoverage lectromc dlctionanes have been builtSimple and compound words have beendescnbed, and their hnguIstlc haracteristics havebeen hand-coded by computational lexicographersusing a common methodMost of these lex~cal resources can now beimported into the Intex NLP system ~, and thenautomatically applied to large texts Within thescope of this article, we describe the set of lexicalresources built so far for Portuguese, and we gwedifferent examples of automatic Portuguese textparsing2 Portuguese Electronic DictionariesBy electromc dictionary, we mean a computerizedlexicon specifically elaborated to be used tnautomatic text parsing operations (indexing,recognition of complex words, technical andcommon, etc ) Thus, large coverage lectronicdlctlonanes were built for Portuguese for thatpurposeThe set of lexIcal data is organized according tothe formal complexity of the lexlcal units ThePortuguese DELAS IS the central element of thed~ctionary system Itcontains more than 110,000simple words, whose grammatical ttributes aresystemaucally described and encoded The set ofcompound words Is structured m the PortugueseDELAC At the moment, it Is constituted by alexicon of 22,000 compound nouns and 3,000frozen adverbs, so it is stdl far from adequatecompletion 22.1 The DELAS and DELAF DictionariesAs said before, DELAS is the dIctmnary of simplewords We understand by simple words the lexlcalunits that correspond to a continuous tring ofi See http//www ladl lUSSleu fr/IN'I~X/mdex htm ll2 The French DELAC contains (Sdberztem (1997 189)about 130,000 entries74letters The lexlcal entnes of DELAS have thefollowmg general structure<word>, <formal description>where word represents the canomcal form (thelemma) of a simple lexlcal umt (m general themasculine smgular for the nouns and adjecuves,the mfinmve for the verbs), and formaldescription corresponds to an alphanumenc codecontzanmg mformat~on on the grammaticalattributes of the entries their grammatical c ass(eventually, sub-class), and their morphologicalbehaviorThe mflected forms are automaucally generatedfrom the association of a lemma to an mflecuonalcode the hst of all reflected words constitutes thePortuguese DELAF (1,250,000 word forms)In Portuguese, the major grammatical classesnouns, adjectives and verbs have mflected forms-nouns  and adjectives can appear m thefemmme and/or m the plural, they can recewedtmmuUve and augmentaave suffixes, thesuperlative degree of the adjectives can beexpressed by morphological means (suffixes),-verbs  are conjugated (mood, tense, person,number), furthermore, some verbal forms canundergo formal mo&ficattons reduced by thepresence of a clmc pronounThus, the DELAS entriesgato, NOID1gordo, AOIDIS1(where N and A mdtcate that gato (cat) ts a nounand gordo (fat) Is an adjective, 01 corresponds tothe mflectlon rule for mascuhne, feminine,smgular and plural, DI and $1 exphclt he type ofdtmmuttve and superlative suffixes that can beaccepted by these entries) produce the followinginfected forms (DELAF entnes)gato, gato N ms (cat)gata, gato N fsgatos, gato N mpgatas, gato N fpgatmho, gato N Dms (httle cat)gatmha, gato N Dfsgattnhos, gato N Dmpgatmhas, gato N Dfpgordo, gordo A ms (fat)gorda, gordo A fsgordos, gordo Ampgordas, gordo A fp75gordmho, gordo A Dins (rather fat)gordmha, gordo A Dfsgordmhos, gordo A Dmpgordmhas, gordo A Dfpgordlsslmo, gordo A Sms (very fat)gordfsstma, gordo A Sfsgord?sstmos, gordo A Stopgord\[sstmas, gordo A SfpAs for the verbs, for mstance, dar (to gwe)dar, VO2tgives rise to a hst of 73 reflected forms thatcorrespond to the normal conjugation of a non-defective verb, in addmon, dar can be constructedwith clmc pronouns (t), m the posmon ofaccusative and dative complements So, m(1) Nds demos o hvro ~ Maria(Lit We gave the book to Maria)the verb form demos expresses mdlcatlve mood,past tense, and first person pluralFrom a syntactic point of view, dar Is constructedwith three arguments, ubject Nds (we) and twocomplements o hvro (the book), fi Maria (toMaria) The complement syntacuc posmons canbe fulfilled by clmc pronouns, respecavely, o (it),accusative, and lhe (her), dauve, as m(2) N6s demo-lo ~ Maria(Lit We gave tt to Maria)(3) N6s demos-lhe o hvro(Lit We gave her the book)(4) Nds demos-lho(Lit We gave her_t0In (2), the direct object has been chttclzed, and,due to historical phonetic reasons, both theaccusative pronoun and the verb have undergoneformal modifications o>lo, demos>demo In (4),both pronouns (dative and accusative) areobhgatonly agglutinated, forming the contractionlho ( <lhe + o)So, even though the analysts of the combinationsverb-chttc Is a syntactic matter, given themorphological changes reduced by suchcombinations m Portuguese, a first descnptlonhad to be made at the morphcqegtcal levelOn the other hand, the example m (4) dlustrates acase where the formal notion of simple word doesnot correspond to an adequate hngutstlc analys~sIndeed, the form lho results from the contractionof two Independent oronouns lhe + o InPortuguese, contracted forms Issued from theagglutmatton of two different words (and twodifferent grammaucal categones) are commonlyobserved We give some simple examples ofcontracuons resulting from the merging ofpreposmons with determiners, pronouns andadverbspel(o,a, os, as) < por + (o,a, os, as)(by the)del(e,a, es, as) < de + (ele, ela, eles, elas)(of (him, her, them))daqut < de + aqut(from here)The relationship between contractions and theirbase constituent categories are estabhshed byfinite-state ransducers ( ee below)2.2 Dictionaries for CompoundsCompound words, l e, lexical units that areconstituted by a fixed combination of s~mplewords, represent a large amount of the lexicon ofany language One has only to underline m a textthe sequences of words that are frozen together tosome extent o realize that compounds constitutean important percentage ofthe text 3 It is thereforeillusory to envisage any sort of automaticprocessing before a slgmficant lexlcal coverage isachieved.
The Issue is even more acute if oneconsiders the description of sclenttfic or technicaltexts or any speciahzed lexicon, where thenumber of compounds can rise up to appalhngfiguresAs said in 2 compounds are structured m thePortuguese DELAC Priority was given tO thehstlng and formahzatlon of compound nouns, thatcan mflect lua de mel - luas de mel (honeymoon),and to compound adverbs, that are invariable derepente (suddenly) From the point of view of thelexicon, the mare focus, especially as far ascompound nouns are concerned, has been theevery-day, not too techmcal, lexiconIn order to ~dentlfy compound words, anddlstmgulsh them from formally Identical wordfree combinations, a set of morpho-syntactlccriteria was adopted (Ranchhod (1991), Bapttsta(1995)) In short, compounds are the sequences ofwords that present restncUons to theSee 5 ~Parsmg Texts Using INTEX Tools-combinatorial properttes that they were supposedto haveThe formallzauon of compound tcuonary entriesis slmdar to that of simple words Sincecompound adverbs, preposluons and conjunctionsdo not reflect, their formats are rather s~mplede repente, ADV+PC(suddenly)para corn, PREP(towards)afire de, CONJ(m order to)Compound nouns, however, have generallyreflected forms The rules for the mflect~on ofcompound nouns presented by grammarians doapply to some cases, but most compound nounsexhibit mflecuonal restrictions on gender ornumber that cannot be accounted by themorphological properties of their constituents Inthe DELA format, the inflectional properties ofcompound nouns are specified according to thesame criteria s m the dictionary of simple wordsThus, g~ven the following nominal entries of theDELACser(21)humano(Ol), N + NA ms - +(human being)guerra frta, N + NA fs - -(cold war)vtstta(30) de estudo, N + NDN fs - +(field trip)The first two compound nouns, ser humano andguerra frta have an internal structure NounAdjective (NA), the most productwe class mPortuguese, vtstta de estudo ~s a compound ofstructure Noun de Noun, also a very productweone Each entry is characterized by the posslbdlty(+) or lmposstbtllty (-) of gender and numberreflection, respecttvely, the elements of thecompound that can be inflected receive themflecuonal code that they have m the DELASboth constltuents of ser humano inflect (innumber) according to, respectively, the rules 21and 01 ser humano - seres humanos, guerra frtais invariable, and the noun vlstta de estudo onlyallows the inflection of vtstta vtstta de estudo -vtsttas de estudoAs well as for other languages (e g French),addluonal mformat~on Is being added, namelysemantic762.3 Local GrammarsMost of the local hngutstgc phenomena, s well asmany complex sentences, are represented m anatural way by the formalism of finite-stateautomata (FSA) For instance, frozen or semt-frozen structures are very naturally described bygraphs, that represent FSAs (Sllberztem (1997))We illustrate the use of graphs with an elementaryexample, selected from the hbrarles of Portugueselocal grammars This grammar descnbes a familyof adverbial expressions (dates), which refer to aperiod of ttme around the middle of the months(or, by extensmn, of some years) as m theunderlined expressionlsso aconteceu nos tdos de Marfo(That happened on the ides of March)\ / ?a l M~,' ~o,.
