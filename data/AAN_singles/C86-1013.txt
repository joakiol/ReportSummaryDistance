70, D- 1000 Hamburg 13AbstractThis paper presents an approach for processing incomplete andinconsistent knowledge.
Beais for atteoking these prob\]ems are'structures of determination', which are extensions of Scott'sapproximation \]atticea taking into consideration some reguirements fromnatural language processing and representation of knowledge.
The theorydeveloped is exemplified with processing plural noun phrases referringto objects which have to be understood as classes or cots.
Referentialprocesses are hand\]ed by processes on 'Referential Nets', which ere aspecific knowledge structure developed for the representation ofobject-oriented know\]edge.
Problems of determination with respect tocardinaIity assumptions are emphasized.I .
Introductory remarksMost approaches to 'proceesing reference' are concerned with the case ofsingular NPs and deal with the complications of plurals on\]yperiphericolly by remarks af the kind "The plural case can be consideredanalogously."
But such hopes are only partially justified: the plural caseis worse and therefore more interesting.In the present paper I wlll discuss some spsclflc prob\]ems of(in)definiteness with respect to plurals from an AI point of view.
Theheart of any knowledge-based system (KB$) - man or machine - is his/her/Its knowledge base (KB), containing different ypes af knowledge (cp.sect.
2).
The KB reflects the KB5' view af the world; in other (e.g.dackendoff's, 1983) words: a projected world.
(O/ring emphasis toprojected worlds and thus to mental models leads to a psychologicalfoundation of semantics.
)The case easiest ta manage is that of a complete and consistent KB.
But innormal life - of man es well as machine - thia almost never occurs; theknowledge is incomplete or inconsistent (or both).
There are somereasons (cp.
sect 3, ,t) to see both types of problem as clase\]y connected,as twin problems, abbreviated by I&l.
It is important to extend the KBS'faculties with regard to the maintenance af I&l.
This includes:- Recognition and detection of I&l- Correction of I&l, i.e.
forcing completeness and consistency- Dealing, i.e.
arguing ar 'thinking', with Incomplete orinconsistent knowledge.These tasks for maintaining I&l is of specific importance in processingreference.2.
\]he frame of representationIn representing the knowledge about the world (not linguistic knowledge)of a KBS I distinguish three types, hnawledge of facts, knowledge ofru/~and knaw/ed\]e af objects, which is represented by 'Referential Nets'(ReiN).
The formal objects, which can be underatood as internal (armental) proxies for entities of the real (or other possible) world(s) arecalled 'Referential Objects' (RafO).
RefOB can be seen as underdetermlnedformal objects (UFCO) in case of incompleteness, or as overdetermined(OFOs) in case of inconsistency.For representing the knowledge of a KB$ and the meaning of utterances Iuse a propositional 'eamanttc representation language' $RL.
Farprocessing, e.g.
storing and retrieving, referential relations SRL containsapectfic 'descriptian operators', which are from a formal point of viewvariable-binding, term-making operators.
Here I will neglect he detailsof 5RL and exemplify only those 8RL-concopta which are involved inknowledge about objects (cp.
Habel, 1986).
The tatellty of RafOs andtheir properties (see below) form a net-like knowledge structure: theRef~rentialNet(ReiN).
ReINs are based on three types of formal entities:62referentialebj~ts(RafOs) as system-internal proxies of the abjecte ofthe world, designMionsaf RefOs, i.e.
terms \[as opposed to formulas) of8RL and attribute~ to RafOs and dssignationa.
From a formal point of view(Habel, 1985, 1986) these (double-attributed) ReiNs form a relationwithAARefN c (R-ATT x REFO) x D-TER x D-ATTRemarks:1.
REFO is the set af all referential objects at a specific point af time ( Ineglect lme-indecos in the present paper); D-TER, R-ATT, D-ATT arethe set of 8RL-expreseions of the types 'designating term', 'attribute toRefOs', 'attributes to pairs of RefOs and D-terms'.2.
Bracketing RefOs and their attributes reflects that in AARefNs the 1 stcomponent is functional dependent of the 2nd.A first example will illustrate the concepts of the ReiN:( 1 ) John's children will travel abroad during their summer vacation.leads to the following entries in a ReIN (only the most relevant parts areformulated; attributes are omitted in the present sect.
):( I ' )  r. I - -  'John'r.2 - -  ALL x : child_of (r. 1, x)" " -  SOHE x :trave\] (x, r.3, r.4)r. 3 - -  "abroad"r.4 - -  "during r.2'a summer vacation"Remarks:I.
There are proxies for objects in a narrow sense as waI\] as for somein a wider sense, e.g.w.r.t, locations (r.3) or time (r.4).
TheirSRL-designaticos will nat be formalized here.2.
"ALL" is the intenstonal c ass-building operator, which differs fromthe formula-making universal quantifier.
"SOME" is the indefinitepluro\] term-maklng analogy to the definite "ALL".
(On "SOtIE", tlledefinite descriptor "IOTA" and the indefinite "ETA", which are used in(5'), cp.
Hahel 1982, 1986).3.
ItefNs: Under- and overdeterminetionIn the following I will mainly deal with proxies for concrete objects,especially persons.
A first analysis of the situation in question shows thata hearer of ( I ) possesses a RefO representing "John's children" withoutthe abligation to knew more details about them.
e.g., though s/he does nothave to know how many they are it is passible to refer to them definitely.With the introduction of the additional concept 'attribute of e RefO' it ispossible to deal with the I&l problem, 1.e.
the problems af under- andoverdetermination of formal objects.
(Furthermore, the use of attributesleads to knowledge representations which allow easy and quick access tothe objects in question, e.g.
in anaphora resolution and generation).
Amore adequate analysis of ( I ) should lead to a representation, whichrepresents the plural explicitly (and not only implicitly via "ALL"):(1") card~2- -  r .2 - -  ALLx:chi ld_of(r .
l ,x)human - Jusing a cardlnality attr/Dute to the RefO r.2 which represents theessential property that r.2's real-world counterpart is assumed toconsist of more than one human being; the sertal attribute "human",which will be, used here only, exemplifies another type of attribute,namely ~rtalattribut~By this attribute mechanism I represent the meaning of numerals, e.g.
"dahn's two cars" leads tocard= 2-r.9 ~ ALL x:cor (x) &ewn(r .
l ,x )In text generation the communicative goals determine whichdesignation(s) and R-ATTs are used to form the content of the message.What counts as determinate depends an the type of attribute in question.Each type of attribute possesses its own cot af completeness andconsistency conditions.
In the case of cardlnallty, the determinacycondition is given by(2 )  ~rd ina l i t?
Cond i t ion :Each set has exactly one cerdinolity.This eondition defines the idaal-state of the cardinality attribute which asystem aspires to.
The actual knowledge with respect to cardine\]ityconcerns a 'rarlge of pesslble cordlna\]lttes'.
From this follows whatunder- and overdeterminotion ( I&l)  are:- in the case of underdotarmination some cerdinalities are pessible, eg.the cardtnallty Is greater or ague1 2, but the exact value is unknown,in the determinate ~ only one cardinolity is possible, i.e.
the exactcardinality is known,- In the case of overdetermination more than one cerdinality isassumed, which violates the cerdinality condition.I wll l  go on with dohn's children:(3)  The boys wil l  visit France.
Hory and Sue wil l  go to Italy.Analogously to ( 1 ) the ReiN has to be extended to:(3') cord;~'t ~ r .2 - - -  ALLx :chllr.L_of ( r .
l , x )cord ~ 2 - -  r.5 ~ ALL x : child_of (r.  1, x) & boy(x)SOME x :visit  (x, 'France')cord ~.
2 ~ r.6 - -  ALL x : child_of (r. I ,  x) & girl (x)CONTAINS (r .7)CLASS ('Mary', 'Sue')card --, 2 ~ r.7 ~ SOME x : visit (x, 'Italy')Remarks:1.
"cord(r.6) ~ 2" because tt ls pesslble that there ere furtherdaughters of John.
Note, that o\]l bays - "cord(r.5) ~.
2" - visit Francebut only some girls, namely those represented by r.7, visit Italy.2.
I assume that the competence of calculating attributes is used in themaintenance of ReiNs.
By this "cord(r.2) ~.
4" is calculated fromcord(r.5) and cord(r.6).3.
There exists an operator "IS_CONTAINED" duo\] to "CONTAINS",which I neglect in this paper (ep.
Habel, 1986).r.7 con be seen as determined wlth respect to cordinoilty since an exactvalue is assumed, whereas r.2, r.5 end r.6 are underdetermined.
As a \]estexample for cordinality computations, let us take the input(~r) John has four or five children.
Three of them are girls.That leads to the following changes in the ReiN:(4') cord := 5 - - -  r.2 ALL x : chlld__of (r. 1, x)~ CONTAINS (r .5)CONTAINS (r.6)ALL x : child_of ( r .
i ,  x) & hay(x)cord == 2 -  r.5 ~ SOME x : visit (x, 'France')ALL x : child_of (r. l ,  x) & girl (x)card,= 3 .
- -  r.6 ~ CONTAINS (r.7)Bemark:In a first step (corresponding to the first part of the input) cord(r.2)is sat to ,1 or ,5, In a ,second (inferential) step card(r.2) is computed to`5 based on the cerdinalities of r.5 (>_2) and r.6 (=3).
In a third stepcard(r.5) can t)e computed to exactly 2.New we turn to overdoterminotton, i.e.
inconsistencies.
Suppose someonetells the KBS (or" you):(5) The oldest, Peter, travels to Spain.What is there to do now?
Where are the problems, hew are they noticed,and how can they be solved?
Before rejecting (5) wlth "That lsimpossible!"
let us discuss the changes in the REIN:(5') cord=5~ r .2~ ALLx :ch i ld_o f ( r .
l , x )card > 5 - -~  ~ CONTAINS (r.5)CONTAINS (r.6)card := 2 - -  r.5 -----card ~ 5 " /card = :5 ~-  r.6card = 2 - -  r.7 ~- -card -  1 - - -  r.8=---~ALL x : child_of (r .1, x) & boy(x)SOME x : visit (x,  'France')CONTAINS (r.8)ALL x : clli\]d_of (r. 1, x) & girl (x)CONTAINS (r .7)CLASS ( 'Hary', 'Sue')'Peter"IOTAx : oldest(x, r.2)ETA x: visit(x, '3pain')Remark:The newly created RefO r.8 is integrated in the ReiN by two links: on theone hand via CONTAINS from r.5 "the bays"; this link is inferred by useof knowledgo about Christian names in English.
On the other hand via theoldost-eonnectlon to r.2.
Thus the cordlnalltles of r.2 and r.5 (In 4')have to be changed, which is rcolized by assigning o second cardinolityattribute.
(This reading of the sentence end interpretation of the netassumes a third son, "Peter", which vlslts Spain only.
Note, that theinheritance about visiting France can be blocked via the 3rd designationof r.8.The points of inconsistency or everdetermination can be \]coated at thecardinality of r.2 ("card=5" vs. "eard>5") and of r.5 ("card=2" vs."card,~ 3").
What is reasonable to do now?
There are several poselbiltties:- Reject the newest input.
But why should "card=5" be preferable to"cord>5" (or "card=2" to "cerd~3")?- Try to eo\]va the inconsistencies.
Ask other people or undo inferences.- Try to live with inconsistencies.
Be aware that reasoning con bedangerous.Why is it convenient and pessible to fol\]ow the third strategy?
On the onehand, though there are inconsistencies with respect to the cerdineHty ofr.2 and r.5, these inconsistenclaa ore localized and do not infect the wholeKB.
(This strategy of marking inconsistencies and thus avoiding infectionsof the KB, i.e.
putting inconsistencies in quarantine, follows 8elnap(1976)).
Therefore the system is justified In answering questions withregard to other ports of the ReiN.On the other hand, locating paints/cress of inconsistency and waiting forfuture information con \]Pad - by means of inferences - to the solution ofthe inconsistency in question.
One possible correction of theinconsistencies in (5')  cou\]d be ~chieved by detecting that the informantsu~d different concepts of 'daughter', e.g.
'daughter', 'sdepted daughter','stepdaughter'.
In the pre~.~nt example the "updating of the boys", i.e.
thenew "cord(r.5) ~ 3", was not given explicitly but was inferred from themale Christian names 'Peter'.
It is possible that the inference in question,which uses common knowledge about Christian names, was misleading,because John's oldest daughter is nicknamed, she is "a girl named Peter"(as Russoll's wife, who was known as Peter Spence).B.e~ac_k~1.
Another way of analysis, namely concerning designations but notcerdinalities, leads to a different solution with respect to r.8.
Peter canbe seen as a person visiting both France and Spain.
Note, that thisreading would also be baaed on a careful analysis of card(r.5).2.
The parallel example in Carman would lesd either not to aninconsistency at all or to another type of inconsistency sincegender-informatiea of the article would distinguish between two cases:"Der ~lteste, Peter..." ('dor' ~ 'masc.')
leads also to (5'),  but thepossibilities for the solution of the overdotermination mentioned aboveare not usable in this case.
"Die ~lteste, Peter..." ('die' ~ 'fern.')
leads tolinkage of r.8 to r.6, "the girls", and no inconsistency of cardinalitywould appear.
But, most hearers would be suprised with the strangeChristian name of the girl.The similarities and differences of under- and overdetermination, i.e.
thejustification of the twin-concept I&l, can be seen best by discussing theappropriate response to questions llke "How many children does ,Johnhave?".
On the one hand with respect to on undardatermined case, e.g.
(6) card ~ 5 r.2' ALLx :ch i Id_o f ( r .
l , x )induced by "John lies five or more children".In the case of underdetermination (6) the KBS knows that it hasincomplete knowledge and therefore it is justified in answering "Five ormore, but I don't know ex~ctly".
In the case of overdetormination (5)theKBS knows that it has inconsistent knowledge.
Therefore it should warnthe questioner, e.g.
by responding wlth "Presumably five or more, but Ihave contradictory information".
Note, that it would be reasonable faryou to usa the concept of "John's children" in a similar way if you onlyhave the information in question.634.
Structures of determinntlenFrom a formal point of view the cerdinelity attributes ore examples ofapproximation structures similar to the information lattices introducedby Scott ( 1970); cp.
Belnep (1976).
The lower part of the structure ofdetermination (see Fig.
1 ), "UD-CARD", represents the undardaterminedend the upper one, "OD-CARD", the overdetermined cardinelities.
Thedetermined cases are represented by the "D-CARD" level, which is thesymmetry axis of the structure.
D-COrd is the set of singletons over theset N of natural numbers (including zero); UD-CARD consists of thenot-singleton elements of the power-sat of N with the partial orderinginduced by the set inclusion.
OD-CARD is built up by introducing a 'dual toeach UD-CARO' element, which Is symbolized by square brackets "\[_\]".NILI x,,3\]/ / oo-o .o\[1,2\] \[1,3\] \[2,3\] \[2,4\]{0} {1}......_ {2} {3) {,'1.}

1 : Approximation structure CARD of cordinelity attributesThe D-CARD elements tand for "the cerdinality is exactly the n whichforms the singleton in question".
UD-CARD represents e set of possiblecardinelities.
The minimal entity in the approximation structure, namelyN, holds no relevant information, since "Card=N" stands for "the RefOhas a cardinolity", and this ia true for ell RefOs.
('Cord' is o set ofcardinalities 'cord'.)
Oetting input from communication or inferentialprocesses, leads to climbing up the structure, which reflects theenrichment of information with respect o cardinality, or to no change inknowledge about the attribute.
The ideal-level is reached at theD-CARD-level: an exact cardinelity is assigned.
Further input causes ( inthe good case) no change nd in the bad case of inconsistency climbing upinto the OD-CARD-rogIOn.The structure of determination does not possess lattice properties; onlythe UD-CARD end the OO-cord parts are lattice-like.
The sudden changeat passing from UD-CARD or D-CARD to inconsistent OD-CARDs destroysthe lattice properties (see below).The approach of structures of determination, which is exemplified herewith the case of cordinality attributes, can be ussd analogously withrespect to other types of attributes.
The base of ell such structures erelattices, e.g.
those of eartal attributes, which con be interpreted asapproximation lattices.
This means that climbing up the lattice can beunderstood as increasing information.
(Note.that he ALL-element in thisInterpretation is the bottom-element).
In e (half) formal way, astructure of determination is built up from e Scottien approximation\]etttco (AL) by the following method:1.
Delete NIL from the approximation latticeAL.2.
Devide the rest in the level of determination (LaD) which ia formedby the direct neighbors of the (now deleted) NIL end theundardatermined part of the lattice (UD-AL) which is given by thoseelements of AL which ere neither NIL nor in LaD.3.
With respect to UD-AL construct a dual counterpart ofoverdetermined lements.
This Is called OD-AL.'1.
Olue OD-AL with UD-AL via the level of determination LaD.5.
The ordering relations can be defined in the canonical way.As mentioned for the case of cerdlnn\]lty attributes such structur~ ofdetermination do not possess lattice properties.
This is proven in Hebel(1986).
The same phenomenon is observed by Belnap (1976) withrespect to his set of episternic stete~, E. The lattice properties ereviolated at the passage to inconsistency (everdatorminetion).Nevertheless, the most relevant properties of Scott's approximationlattices else hold for structures of determination, especially theemplietivityby/nput( using Belnap's terminology).
One very importantdifference between Scott's approach and determination structuresconcerns the NIL, which is the (!)
failure element of ALs.
In contrast,structures of determination contain many different failure elements,namely all beyond the level of determination.
Thus a condensed history ofinforming end dtsinforming is abbreviated by the OD-ettribute.
(Acherercterizetion of Scott's epprasch could be: "All failures ere equal,namely disastrous. ")
Repair processes, which e.g.
can be triggered byInput from an especially competent or believable informant, e.g.
withrespect o my example by dohn himself, levi to climbing downward in thestructure.
Note, that repairing is informing of a specific type.
In contrastto normal informing it leads downwards; this changing of the directiondemands a specific prior decision based on the experience that somethingwas going wrong.I conclude this section with e remark on overdetermination:Overdstermined objects ere e specific type of /mpossl'ble objects (cp.Rapeport 1985), which constitute  test case for every semantic theory.
'Impossibility' or 'non-existence' (as used in some approaches to thistopic) refer to the real world and not to projected worlds, which are inthe mind.5.
ConclusionIn this paper I have only dealt with I&l problems concerning the subtypeof referential knowledge.
Obviously, e similar approach is appropriatefor the other subtypes of knowledge, i.e.
for other formal objects.
(Noticethat assentia\] properties of RefOs, such as cerdinalfty, can also be seen asport of factual knowledge.)
In the case of factual knowledgeundardeterminetion r overdaterminetion concerns truth values.
Belnep's(1976) four-valued logic with e lattice-theoretic semantics hasinfluenced the concepts of the present paper from e logical point of view.Same types of ReiNs end of structures of determination ere implementedas parts of prototypicol text-understanding systems by the KIT-projectsat the Technical University Berlin.ReferencesBelnep, H ( 1976): "How e computer should think", in O.
