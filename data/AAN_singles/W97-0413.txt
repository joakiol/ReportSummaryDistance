Combining Situated Reasoning with Semantic TransferMinimally*Tsutomu Fuj inamitsutomu~ims, uni-sttutgart, deInst i tut  ffir Maschinelle SprachverarbeitungUniversit/it Stut tgart1 OverviewWith extra-linguistic information, the qual-ity of translation will be improved and theproblem of translation mismatches can besolved.
The difficulty lies, however, in thatthe sources of such information are unlimitedand not always available.
Our solution is todefine translation rules as modular as possi-ble and control application of rules with back-ground conditions o that the best rule in thecontext should be chosen.2 Viewpoint  and honorificsWe consider as an example how the transla-tion of sentences containing 'give' is definedin our approach.
For the English verb, 'give',there are at least four possible translationsin Japanese: 'kureru', 'kudasaru', 'ageru',and 'sashiageru'.
'kureru' is used when theevent is described from receiver's point of view(pov) while 'ageru' is used when the eventis described from giver's point of view.
'ku-dasaru' is a honorific form of 'kureru', wherethe giver stands in higher position than thereceiver.
Both 'kureru' and 'kudasaru' canonly be used when the giver is not the firstperson, typically the speaker in our domain.
'sashiageru' is a honorific form of 'ageru',where the giver stands in lower position thanthe receiver.
Both 'ageru' and 'sashiageru'can only be used when the receiver is not thefirst person, say, the speaker.Figure 1 depicts the translation relationbetween 'give' and ( 'kureru ', 'kudasaru ','ageru', 'sashiageru').
The rule at the topnode, 'ageru' ?
* 'give ', is the default transla-tion rule translating 'ageru' to 'give' and viceversa independent of any background condi-tion.
From here downwards, the items of in-formation considered in background increase.Moving down leftwards, for example, if theviewpoint is at the receiver and the giver isnot the first person, then the rule, 'kureru''give', is applicable.3 Semantic transferTranslation rules are applied to part of repre-sentations.
To make 'ageru' and 'give' inter-changeable, a rule such as ageru(E) ~ give(E)is suffice, where E is an event.
For bettertranslation, however, more elaborated rulesare required.
The below four rules define thecases where 'give' is to be translated to either"The work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology(BMBF) in the framework of the Vebmobil project.92.

The nega-tion, -~, works as negation-by-failure.give(E),{giver(E,G),(1) kureru(E) ?=~ receiver(E,R),pov(R),~speaker(G)}give(E),{giver(E,G),receiver(E,R), (2) kudasaru(E) ?, pov(R),~speaker(G),G>R}give(E),{giver(n,G),(3) ageru(E) ?
:v receiver(E,R),pov(G),~speaker(R) }give(E),{giver(E,G),receiver(E,R), (4) sashiageru(E) ?
:v pov(G),~speaker(R),G<R}Observe that the background condition of (2)subsumes that of (1).
Since our translationstrategy chooses the best match rule in thecontext, if the condition of (2) is satisfied,the rule (2) is chosen although the conditionof (1) is satisfied, too.
The honorific expres-sion is thus adopted prior to the normal onewhen translation isperformed from English toJapanese.
The same goes for the rules, (3) and(4).
If no rule satisfies the background condi-tion, the simplest rule, ageru(E) ?, give(E),is chosen as default.4 ConclusionRules axe defeasible in that a rule can beoverridden by another more appropriate inthe context even if the rule is still applica-ble.
This property, on the one hand, allowsus to import our knowledge in machine trans-lation into speech-to-speech translation as de-fault and, on the other hand, enables us to im-prove incrementally the quality of translationby adding to the rule-base the rules applicableonly in particular contexts as more sources ofinformation are made available to the system.93
