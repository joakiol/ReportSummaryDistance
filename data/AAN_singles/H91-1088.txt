PROGRESS REPORT FOR DARPA SLS PROGRAMAT DRAGON SYSTEMS, INC. 1Janet Baker and Larry GillickDragon Systems, Inc.320 Nevada StreetNewton, Massachusetts 02160DRAGON@A.ISI .EDUTEL: (617) 965-5200FAX: (617) 527-0372INTRODUCTIONThis report provides a brief summary of recent work anddescnbes anticipated future work in continuous peechrecognition research at Dragon Systems under the auspices ofDARPA's Spoken Language Systems project.REVIEW OF CURRENT WORKDragon Systems has continued to develop its continuousspeech recognition capability on personal computers, with astrong focus on achieving real-time or near real-timeperformance in that environment We are now able to runrecognition using vocabularies of up to 5000 words, althoughthe larger vocabularies do slow down the recognitionsubstantially; therefore more work still needs to be done toimprove the computational efficiency of our algorithms.The recogn~er now has an interface which allows for on-line adaptation.
This interface constitutes a beginning step inthe development of a "DragonDictate"-like e r~ correctionfacility fet continuous peech, one that would allow a user todictate text, correcting en~s as he proceeds, with the systemgradually improving its models by using the feedback from theuser's error corrections.In recent months Dragon has turned its attention to ResourceManagement, and this has resulted in a new focus on thespecial characteristics of this particular task; of course, Dragoncontinues to place a slrong emphasis on improving overallrecognition accuracy in a way that will benefit he general runof speech recognition appfications.
In order to use thedigitized speech supplied on CD-Rom the first step was towrite software that would closely emulate the old signalprocessing done on our standard hardware, so that we wouldhave a baseline perf~rnance assessment that could be used toevaluate the new, more computationally demanding signalprocessing algorithms that we plan to implement in the nearfuture.
We then went through several cycles of developmenton our adaptation and Iraining alg~-ithms in the course ofgradually improving our perfefmance on the RM1 developmenttest data and are still in a period of rapid development.
Toenhance our ability to perform experiments with the largequantity of speech data that has been supplied, we ported ourrecognizer to the IBM RS-6000 workstation.
We have acollection of these machines and, now that they have beennetworked together, it is possible to do experiments on manyspeakers imulmeously.
The recognizer has also been portedto the Apple Macintosh computer.With our focus on improving the accuracy of the recognizerhas come a concern with the sources of error.
To enhance ourability to study our sources of error, we have developed adiagnostic program known as ERRSPEC, which displayssegmented spectrograms of utterances and models, togetherwith a variety of revealing plots that highlight where therecognition algorithm has gone wrong.FUTURE PLANSDragon plans to continue its work on the ResourceManagement Task and to begin work on ATIS in the comingmonths.
A primary goal will continue to be improvements inour overall accuracy, but with the additional aim of moving toa mcfe broadly based speaker independent mode~g strategy,one that is likely to be based on mixture distributions (at thePEL level, at the PIC level, and at the word level).
Investigationof alternative signal processing algorithms will also be a highpriority, as we move away from the computational constraintsthat our old hardware had placed on us.
Post processingslrategies based on the outputs from the N-Best algorithm willalso be explored.1.
