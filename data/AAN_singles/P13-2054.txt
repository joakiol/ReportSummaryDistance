Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 300?305,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsSorani Kurdish versus Kurmanji Kurdish: An Empirical ComparisonKyumars Sheykh EsmailiNanyang Technological UniversityN4-B2a-02Singaporekyumarss@ntu.edu.sgShahin SalavatiUniversity of KurdistanSanandajIranshahin.salavati@ieee.orgAbstractResource scarcity along with diversity?both in dialect and script?are the two pri-mary challenges in Kurdish language pro-cessing.
In this paper we aim at addressingthese two problems by (i) building a textcorpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the twomain dialects of Kurdish, and (ii) high-lighting some of the orthographic, phono-logical, and morphological differences be-tween these two dialects from statisticaland rule-based perspectives.1 IntroductionDespite having 20 to 30 millions of native speak-ers (Haig and Matras, 2002; Hassanpour et al,2012; Thackston, 2006b; Thackston, 2006a), Kur-dish is among the less-resourced languages forwhich the only linguistic resource available on theWeb is raw text (Walther and Sagot, 2010).Apart from the resource-scarcity problem, itsdiversity ?in both dialect and writing systems?is another primary challenge in Kurdish languageprocessing (Gautier, 1998; Gautier, 1996; Esmaili,2012).
In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standardlanguage (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al, 2012):the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based al-phabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latin-based alphabet.
The features distinguishing thesetwo dialects are phonological, lexical, and mor-phological.In this paper we report on the first outcomes ofa project1 at University of Kurdistan (UoK) thataims at addressing these two challenges of theKurdish language processing.
More specifically,in this paper:1. we report on the construction of the firstrelatively-large and publicly-available textcorpus for the Kurdish language,1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm2.
we present some insights into the ortho-graphic, phonological, and morphologicaldifferences between Sorani Kurdish and Kur-manji Kurdish.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.In Section 2, we first briefly introduce the Kurdishlanguage and its two main dialects then underlinetheir differences from a rule-based (a.k.a.
corpus-independent) perspective.
Next, after presentingthe Pewan text corpus in Section 3, we use it toconduct a statistical comparison of the two dialectsin Section 4.
The paper is concluded in Section 5.2 The Kurdish Language and DialectsKurdish belongs to the Indo-Iranian family ofIndo-European languages.
Its closest better-known relative is Persian.
Kurdish is spoken inKurdistan, a large geographical area spanning theintersections of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria.
It isone of the two official languages of Iraq and has aregional status in Iran.Kurdish is a dialect-rich language, sometimesreferred to as a dialect continuum (Matras andAkin, 2012; Shahsavari, 2010).
In this paper,however, we focus on Sorani and Kurmanji whichare the two closely-related and widely-spoken di-alects of the Kurdish language.
Together, they ac-count for more than 75% of native Kurdish speak-ers (Walther and Sagot, 2010).As summarized below, these two dialects differnot only in some linguistics aspects, but also intheir writing systems.2.1 Morphological DifferencesThe important morphological differencesare (MacKenzie, 1961; Haig and Matras,2002; Samvelian, 2007):1.
Kurmanji is more conservative in retainingboth gender (feminine:masculine) and caseopposition (absolute:oblique) for nouns and300123456789101112131415161718192021222324Arabic?based?

Sorani has largely abandoned thissystem and uses the pronominal suffixes totake over the functions of the cases,2.
in the past-tense transitive verbs, Kurmanjihas the full ergative alignment3 but Sorani,having lost the oblique pronouns, resorts topronominal enclitics,3.
in Sorani, passive and causative are createdvia verb morphology, in Kurmanji they canalso be formed with the helper verbs hatin(?to come?)
and dan (?to give?)
respectively,and4.
the definite marker -aka appears only in So-rani.2.2 Scriptural DifferencesDue to geopolitical reasons (Matras and Reer-shemius, 1991), each of the two dialects has beenusing its own writing system: while Sorani usesan Arabic-based alphabet, Kurmanji is written in aLatin-based one.Figure 1 shows the two standard alphabets andthe mappings between them which we have cate-gorized into three classes:?
one-to-one mappings (Figure 1a), whichcover a large subset of the characters,?
one-to-two mappings (Figure 1b); they re-flect the inherent ambiguities between thetwo writing systems (Barkhoda et al, 2009).While transliterating between these two al-phabets, the contextual information can pro-vide hints in choosing the right counterpart.2Although there is evidence of gender distinctions weak-ening in some varieties of Kurmanji (Haig and Matras, 2002).3Recent research suggests that ergativity in Kurmanji isweakening due to either internally-induced change or contactwith Turkish (Dixon, 1994; Dorleijn, 1996; Mahalingappa,2010), perhaps moving towards a full nominative-accusativesystem.?
one-to-zero mappings (Figure 1c); they canbe further split into two distinct subcate-gories: (i) the strong L and strong R char-acters ({ } and { }) are used only in SoraniKurdish4 and demonstrate some of the inher-ent phonological differences between Soraniand Kurmanji, and (ii) the remaining threecharacters are primarily used in the Arabicloanwords in Sorani (in Kurmanji they areapproximated with other characters).It should be noted that both of these writing sys-tems are phonetic (Gautier, 1998); that is, vowelsare explicitly represented and their use is manda-tory.3 The Pewan CorpusText corpora are essential to Computational Lin-guistics and Natural Language Processing.
In spitethe few attempts to build corpus (Gautier, 1998)and lexicon (Walther and Sagot, 2010), Kurdishstill does not have any large-scale and reliable gen-eral or domain-specific corpus.At UoK, we followed TREC (TREC, 2013)?scommon practice and used news articles to builda text corpus for the Kurdish language.
After sur-veying a range of options we chose two onlinenews agencies: (i) Peyamner (Peyamner, 2013), apopular multi-lingual news agency based in IraqiKurdistan, and (ii) the Sorani (VOA, 2013b) andthe Kurmanji (VOA, 2013a) websites of Voice OfAmerica.
Our main selection criteria were: (i)number of articles, (ii) subject diversity, and (iii)crawl-friendliness.For each agency, we developed a crawler tofetch the articles and extract their textual content.In case of Peyamner, since articles have no lan-guage label, we additionally implemented a sim-ple classifier that decides each page?s language4Although there are a handful of words with the latter inKurmanji too.301Property SoraniCorpus KurmanjiCorpusNo.

The articlesare dated between 2003 and 2012 and their sizesrange from 1KB to 154KB (on average 2.6KB).Table 1 summarizes the important properties ofour corpus which we named Pewan ?a Kurdishword meaning ?measurement.
?Using Pewan and similar to the approach em-ployed in (Savoy, 1999), we also built a list ofKurdish stopwords.
To this end, we manually ex-amined the top 300 frequent words of each di-alect and removed the corpus-specific biases (e.g.,?Iraq?, ?Kurdistan?, ?Regional?, ?Government?,?Reported?
and etc).
The final Sorani and Kur-manji lists contain 157 and 152 words respec-tively, and as in other languages, they mainly con-sist of prepositions.Pewan, as well as the stopword lists can be ob-tained from (Pewan, 2013).
We hope that makingthese resources publicly available, will bolster fur-ther research on Kurdish language.4 Empirical StudyIn the first part of this section, we first look at thecharacter and word frequencies and try to obtainsome insights about the phonological and lexicalcorrelations and discrepancies between Sorani andKurmanji.In the second part, we investigate two well-known linguistic laws ?Heaps?
and Zipf?s.
Al-though these laws have been observed in manyof the Indo-European languages (Lu?
et al, 2013),the their coefficients depend on language (Gel-bukh and Sidorov, 2001) and therefore they can be5The relatively small size of the Kurmanji collection ispart of a more general trend.
In fact, despite having a largernumber of speakers, Kurmanji has far fewer online sourceswith raw text readily available and even those sources do notstrictly follow its writing standards.
This is partly a result ofdecades of severe restrictions on use of Kurdish language inTurkey, where the majority of Kurmanji speakers live (Has-sanpour et al, 2012).?

It should also be noted that in practice,knowing the coefficients of these laws is importantin, for example, full-text database design, since itallows predicting some properties of the index asa function of the size of the database.4.1 Character FrequenciesIn this experiment we measure the character fre-quencies, as a phonological property of the lan-guage.
Figure 2 shows the frequency-ranked lists(from left to right, in decreasing order) of charac-ters of both dialects in the Pewan corpus.
Note thatfor a fairer comparison, we have excluded charac-ters with 1-to-0 and 1-to-2 mappings as well asthree characters from the list of 1-to-1 mappings:A, E?, and U?.
The first two have a skewed frequencydue to their role as Izafe construction6 marker.
Thethird one is mapped to a double-character ( ) inthe Sorani alphabet.Overall, the relative positions of the equivalentcharacters in these two lists are comparable (Fig-ure 2).
However, there are two notable discrepan-cies which further exhibit the intrinsic phonologi-cal differences between Sorani and Kurmanji:?
use of the character J is far more commonin Kurmanji (e.g., in prepositions such as ji?from?
and j??
?too?),?
same holds for the character V; this is, how-6Izafe construction is a shared feature of several West-ern Iranian languages (Samvelian, 2006).
It, approximately,corresponds to the English preposition ?of ?
and is added be-tween prepositions, nouns and adjectives in a phrase (Shams-fard, 2011).3021.0E+001.0E+011.0E+021.0E+ 031.0E+041.0E+051.0E+061.0E+00 1.0E+02 1.0E +04 1.0E+ 06Sora niKurmanjiPersian EnglishNumberof Distinct WordsTotal  Numb er of Words(a) Standard Representation0.0E+005.0E+041.0E+051.5E+052.0E+052.5E+050.0E+00 1.0E+ 06 2.0E+06 3.0E+ 06 4.0E+06Sora niKurmanjiPersian EnglishNumberof Distinct WordsTotal  Numb er of Words(b) Non-logarithmic RepresentationFigure 4: Heaps?

This figurealso contains the links between the words that aretransliteration-equivalent and again shows a highlevel of correlation between the two dialects.
Athorough examination of the longer version of thefrequent terms?
lists, not only further confirms thiscorrelation but also reveals some other notable pat-terns:?
the Sorani generic preposition (?from?)
hasa very wide range of use; in fact, as shown inFigure 3, it is the semantic equivalent of threecommon Kurmanji prepositions (li, ji, anddi),?
in Sorani, a number of the common prepo-sitions (e.g., ?too?)
as well as the verb?to be?
are used as suffix,?
in Kurmanji, some of the most commonprepositions are paired with a postposition(mostly da, de, and ve) and form circum-positions,?
the Kurmanji?s passive/accusative helperverbs (hatin and dan) are among its mostfrequently used words.4.3 Heaps?
LawHeaps?s law (Heaps, 1978) is about the growthof distinct words (a.k.a vocabulary size).
Morespecifically, the number of distinct words in a textis roughly proportional to an exponent of its size:log ni ?
D + h log i (1)Language log ni hSorani 1.91 + 0.78 log i 0.78Kurmanji 2.15 + 0.74 log i 0.74Persian 2.66 + 0.70 log i 0.70English 2.68 + 0.69 log i 0.69Table 2: Heaps?
Linear Regressionwhere ni is the number of distinct words occur-ring before the running word number i, h is theexponent coefficient (between 0 and 1), and D isa constant.
In a logarithmic scale, it is a straightline with about 45?
angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov,2001).We carried out an experiment to measure thegrowth rate of distinct words for both of the Kur-dish dialects as well as the Persian and Englishlanguages.
In this experiment, the Persian cor-pus was drawn from the standard Hamshahri Col-lection (AleAhmad et al, 2009) and The Englishcorpus consisted of the Editorial articles of TheGuardian newspaper7 (Guardian, 2013).As the curves in Figure 4 and the linear re-gression coefficients in Table 2 show, the growthrate of distinct words in both Sorani and Kur-manji Kurdish are higher than Persian and English.This result demonstrates the morphological com-plexity of the Kurdish language (Samvelian, 2007;Walther, 2011).
One of the driving factors be-hind this complexity, is the wide use of suffixes,most notably as: (i) the Izafe construction marker,(ii) the plural noun marker, and (iii) the indefinitemarker.Another important observation from this exper-iment is that Sorani has a higher growth rate com-pared to Kurmanji (h = 0.78 vs. h = 0.74).7Since they are written by native speakers, cover a widespectrum of topics between 2006 and 2013, and have cleanHTML sources.303Figure 5: Zipf?s Laws for Sorani and KurmanjiKurdish, Persian, and English.Language log fr zSorani 7.69?

1.51 log r 1.51English 9.37?
1.85 log r 1.85Table 3: Zipf?s Linear RegressionTwo primary sources of these differences are: (i)the inherent linguistic differences between the twodialects as mentioned earlier (especially, Sorani?sexclusive use of definite marker), (ii) the generaltendency in Sorani to use prepositions and helperverbs as suffix.4.4 Zipf?s LawThe Zipf?s law (Zipf, 1949) states that in anylarge-enough text, the frequency ranks of thewords are inversely proportional to the corre-sponding frequencies:log fr ?
C ?
z log r (2)where fr is the frequency of the word having therank r, z is the exponent coefficient, and C is aconstant.
In a logarithmic scale, it is a straightline with about 45?
angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov,2001).The results of our experiment?plotted curves inFigure 5 and linear regression coefficients in Ta-ble 3?
show that: (i) the distribution of the topmost frequent words in Sorani is uniquely differ-ent; it first shows a sharper drop in the top 10words and then a slower drop for the words rankedbetween 10 and 100, and (ii) in the remaining partsof the curves, both Kurmanji and Sorani behavesimilarly; this is also reflected in their values ofcoefficient z (1.33 and 1.31).5 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper we took the first steps towards ad-dressing the two main challenges in Kurdish lan-guage processing, namely, resource scarcity anddiversity.
We presented Pewan, a text corpus forSorani and Kurmanji, the two principal dialects ofthe Kurdish language.
We also highlighted a rangeof differences between these two dialects and theirwriting systems.The main findings of our analysis can be sum-marized as follows: (i) there are phonologicaldifferences between Sorani and Kurmanji; whilesome phonemes are non-existent in Kurmanji,some others are less-common in Sorani, (ii) theydiffer considerably in their vocabulary growthrates, (iii) Sorani has a peculiar frequency distribu-tion w.r.t.
its highly-common words.
Some of thediscrepancies are due to the existence of a genericpreposition ( ) in Sorani, as well as the generaltendency in its writing system and style to useprepositions as suffix.Our project at UoK is a work in progress.
Re-cently, we have used the Pewan corpus to builda test collection to evaluate Kurdish InformationRetrieval systems (Esmaili et al, 2013).
In future,we plan to first develop stemming algorithms forboth Sorani and Kurmanji and then leverage thosealgorithms to examine the lexical differences be-tween the two dialects.
Another avenue for futurework is to build a transliteration/translation enginebetween Sorani and Kurmanji.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the anonymous reviewers fortheir insightful comments that helped us improvethe quality of the paper.ReferencesAbolfazl AleAhmad, Hadi Amiri, Ehsan Darrudi, Ma-soud Rahgozar, and Farhad Oroumchian.
