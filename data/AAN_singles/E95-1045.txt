ukAbstractThis paper investigates the syntax ofextraposition in the HPSG framework.We present English and German data(partly taken from corpora), and providean analysis using a nonlocal dependencyand lexical rules.
The condition for bind-ing the dependency is formulated rela-tive to the antecedent of the extraposedphrase, which entails that no fixed sitefor extraposition exists.
Our account al-lows to explains the interaction of extra-position with fronting and coordination,and predicts constraints on multiple ex-traposition.1 The Data1.1 Ext rapos i t ion  of  S and PPIn English, phrases can be extraposed, i.e., dislo-cated to the right boundary of a sentence.
Thisphenomenon can be observed with adjuncts, suchas relative clauses or PPs in (1)-(3), as well aswith sentential and prepositional complements asin (4)-(6): 1(1) An entirely new band rings today at GreatTorrington, \[several of whom are members ofthe congregation\].

Part of the work was carried out as partof the Verbmobil Project while the author stayed atthe Institute for Logic and Linguistics, IBM Germany,Heidelberg.1Extraposition data was acquired from the fol-lowing corpora: UPenn Treebank (UP), London-Lund Corpus (LL), Stuttgart Newspaper Cor-pus (STZ).
Other examples were taken from Culi-cover/Rochemont 1990 (CR), Gu~ron 1980 (CR),Haider 1994 (Hal), Nerbonne 1994 (Net), andWiltschko 1994 (Wil).
(2) Nobody must live here \[who is earning morethan twenty pounds a week\].
(LL)(3) A man came into the room \[with blond hair\].
(CR)(4) There is very great public concern in GreatBritain today (...) \[whether the punish-ments which the courts are empowered toimpose are adequate\].
(LL)(5) Extensive and intensive enquiries have beenmade \[into whether this fear of this penaltyin fact deters people from murdering\].
(LL)(6) I don't see much argument myself any longer\[against differential rents\].
(LL)The  antecedent (the category from which the dis-located element is extraposed) is a noun in thesecases.
Languages in which the right VP  bound-ary is clearly marked (as e.g.
by the non-finiteverb in verb-second languages) can provide evi-dence for extraposition with verbal antecedents.Cf.
the following German data, which include theextraposition of adjuncts in (7) and (8), and thatof complements in (9) and (I0).
(7) In der Nacht hatte es Tote gegeben \[inin the night had there victims been inMoskau (..
.)\].

(UP)(12) Were hearing a lot these days \[about sellingabroad, about the importance of Britain ex-porting abroad\].
(LL)1.2 Mul t ip le  Ext rapos i t ionIt is possible to have more than one extraposedphrase, as shown in (13) and (14): 2(13) A man - i  - j  came in \[with blond halr\]i \[whowas smiling\]j.
(14) A paper _i _ j  just came out \[which talksabout extraposition\]i [which you might beinterested in\]j.In these examples, both extraposed elements areassociated with the same antecedent.
We observethat the serialization for multiple extraposed el-ements matters for PPs, but not for relativeclauses:(15)*A man _i _ j  came in \[who was smiling\]j\[with blond hair\]i.
(16) A paper - i  - j  just came out \[which youmight be interested in\]/ \[which talks aboutextraposition\]i.We find a different pattern for multiple extraposi-tion involving distinct antecedents:(17) Its struck a grammarian _ j  last month?
\[who analyzed it\]j \[that this clause isgrammatical\]i.
(Hal)(18)*Iti struck a grammarian _ j last month \[thatthis clause is grammatical\]~ \[who analyzedit\]j.
(Hal)(19) No one _i puts things _ j  in the sink \[thatwould block it\]j \[who wants to go on being afriend of mine\]/.
(Gue)(20)*No one _i puts things _ j  in the sink \[whowants to go on being a friend of mine\]i \[thatwould block it\]j.
(Gue)It is plausible to assume that multiple extraposi-tion with distinct antecedents is subject o a nest-ing requ i rement :  The first extraposed phrasehas to be associated with the last antecedent, thesecond one to the next-to-last antecedent, etc.Both types of constraints also apply for German,cf.
Wiltschko (1994), who provides extensive v-idence for the nesting requirement, including the:We use a trace-like notation to indicate the de-pendencies with extraposition and fronting phenom-ena.
However, our account of extraposition i volvesno traces, cf.
below.following data:(21) weil das Argument - i  einen Mann _jbecause the argument a mananfgeregt hat, \[der das Fest besuchte\]j \[daftupset has who the party visited thatRanchen ungesund ist\]i.
(Wil)smoking unhealthy is(22)*well das Argument _i  einen Mann _ jaufgeregt hat, \[daft Rauchen ungesund ist\]i,\[der das Fest besuchte\]j (Wil)1.3 Ext rapos i t ion  and Front ingThe constraint of f rozenness to fu r ther  ex-t ract ion,  which states that no dislocation is pos-sible out of an extraposed phrase, is widely ac-cepted in the literature.
The contrast between (23)and (24) illustrates this restriction:(23) Whoi did you see a picture of _i  in thenewspaper?
(24)*Whoi did you see a picture in the newspaperof _~?Although this constraint seems to be valid for En-glish, it is possible in German to have fronting ofmaterial from an extraposed phrase: 3(25) Weni hast du geglaubt, daft Maria _~who have you believed that Mariagekfiftt hat?
(Wil)kissed has(26) \[Die Maria\]i hat Peter einem Mann _ jthe Maria has Peter to-a mangesagt, \[den er kannte\]j \[daft er - i  gekiifttsaid who he knew that he kissedhat\].
(Wil)hasOn the other hand, we can also observe xtrapo-sition from fronted phrases, as (27) and (28) showfor fronted subjects and objects, respectively.
(27) \[Ein Buch - j \ ] i  hat er - i  geschrieben \[dasa book has he written whichihn weltberiihmt gemacht hat\]j.him world-famous made has.
(28) \[Ein Buch _j\]i wa~.-i erschienen, \[das ihna book had appeared which himweltberiihmt gemacht hat\]j.world-famous made has.We find similar data with extraposition fromfronted objects in English:(29) \[Which book - j \ ] i  did she write - i  last year\[that akes only two hours to read\]j?
(30) \[Which woman - j \ ] i  did he meet - i  yesterday\[from the south of France\]j?Therefore, we conclude that the phrase struc-ture for extraposition cannot involve a hierarchi-aThese xamples are less acceptable to speakers ofnorthern variants of German.302cal constraint which states that extraposed ele-ments are generally higher than fronted ones orvice versa.
This is confirmed by the observationthat fronted elements can be involved in multipleextraposition as in (26).
Our analysis reflects thisby avoiding the stipulation of a fixed location forextraposition.1.4 Is lands and BoundednessAnother common assumption is that extrapositionis not subject to the islands constraints thathold for extraction to the left.
The contrast be-tween (3) and (31) makes clear that subjects areboundaries for fronting, but not for extraposition:(31)* \[With what color hair\]i did a man - i  comeinto the room?
(CR)Further, the restriction of upward  bounded?hess applies to extraposition, i.e., in contrast ofronting, extraposition may not cross the sentenceboundary:(32) Whoi did Mary say \[s that John saw a pic-ture o f_ i  in the newspaper\]?
(CR)(33)*It was believed \[sthat John saw a picture- i  in the newspaper by everyone\] [of hisbrother\]~.
(CR)We take both constraints as evidence that extra-position is different from fronting and should behandled using a separate nonlocal feature.2 An  HPSG Account2.1 Non loca l  DependenciesWe treat extraposition as a nonlocal dependencyand introduce a new nonlocal feature EXTRA toestablish the connection between an extraposedelement and its antecedent.

Defining EXTRA in this way,we  can rely on the Nonlocal Feature Principle for per-colation; no additional mechan ism is required.5Note that this is a recursive lexical rule, whichAdjunct Extraposition Lexical Rule (AELR)"r,oc \[\] ICATIHEAD nou,~ Vverb\]I NONLOCIINHERIEXTRA \[\] \]L oo Tr  JJJNote that the semantic ontribution of the adjunct(standardly dealt with by the Semantics Princi-ple) is incorporated into this lexical rule.
The shar-ing \[\] states that the CONT-value of the outputis identical with the CONT of the extraposed ele-ment, which in turn incorporates the semantics ofthe input via the sharing \[\].2.2 Per iphery  Mark ingIntuitively, our approach to the phrase structureof extraposition can be formulated as follows:An extraposed constituent has to be bound ontop of a phrase that introduces intervening mate-rial between the extraposed constituent and itsantecedent.
6 Since this constraint on the bind-ing of an extraposed element is relative to its an-tecedent, we have no fixed site for extraposition,which explains the observed interaction betweenextraposition and fronting.
It also entails a nestingrequirement for multiple extraposition, as it trig-gers distinct binding sites for extraposition fromdistinct antecedents: The binding site reflects therelative position of the antecedent, b-hrthermore,we avoid spurious ambiguities which have beenproblematic for previous accounts/Our requirement for EXTRA binding can be for-mulated in HPSG using the notion of per iphery ,which is defined for phrases containing an EXTRAelement: A phrase has a left periphery iff it con-tains an EXTRA element which is inherited from(a) its phrasal rightmost daughter or (b) from itslexical head.
Otherwise, the phrase has a r ightperiphery, and EXTRA elements can be bound onis rather unusual in standard HPSG.
But cf.
van No-ord/Bouma (1994) who show some other cases whererecursive lexical rules are useful and deal with pro-cessing issues as well.6Our analysis is inspired by the Locality Con-straint for Identification (LCI) which Wiltschko(1994) proposes to account for extraposition i a GBframework.
The LCI requires that an extraposed ele-ment is adjoined at the first maximal projection whichdominates its antecedent.ZCf.
Keller 1994, where we posited the S node asa fixed site for the binding of extraposed elements.Apart from leading to spurious ambiguities, this as-sumption is incompatible with the coordination datagiven in sec.
3.1.303top of it.In case (a), no material exists to the right of theextraposed element which could intervene betweenit and an antecedent.
In case (b), the EXTRA el-ement originates directly from a lexical head andwould be indistinguishable from a non-extraposedcomplement or adjunct if bound immediately.
In-tuitively, in both cases, the EXTRA element has tobe bound further up the tree after it has foundintervening material which identifies it as extra-posed.Our periphery definition entails that in a sentencewhich contain more than one projection with aright periphery, multiple locations for extraposi-tion exist correspondingly.
If a sentence containsno projection with a right periphery, no extrapo-sition is possible.To formalize the notion of periphery, we introducea new feature PERIPHERY (PER), which is locatedunder LOCAL.
Its value is of type periphery, de-fined as follows:(34) Partition of periphery: extra, non-extraPartition of non-extra: left, rightThe correct instantiation of PER is guaranteed bythe following condition:(35) Per iphery Marking Condit ion (PMC)A headed phrase is marked \[PER left\] ifit has a daughter D with a non-emptyINHERIEXTRA set, and D isa.
the rightmost daughter and phrasal; orb.
the head daughter and lexical and mark-ed \[PER left\].Note that (35b) allows for periphery marking tobe specified lexically.
We will return to this insec.
2.6, where we formulate a parochial restric-tion for German.
For English, however, we assumethat all lexical entries are marked \[PER left\].2.3 Phrase  St ructureTo implement the binding of extraposed elements,we introduce an additional immediate dominanceschema, which draws on a new subtype of head-struc called head-extra-struc bearing the featureEXTRA-DTRS (taking a list of sign).
As the bindingof extraposed elements i only possible at the rightperiphery of a phrase, the head-extra schema spec-ifies its head daughter as \[PEa right\] and marks itsmother node as \[PEa extra\] (the latter is neededfor the treatment of adjuncts, el.
see.
2.5): sSHere loc(x) denotes a function which takes as x alist of sign and returns a set of loc containing the bocvalues of the elements of x.Head-Extra SchemarLoolPER e ,ro 1LEXTRA-DTRS I~Note that the specification \[INHERIEXTRA { }\] re-quires all members of EXTRA to be bound at thesame level.
This ensures that extraposed elementsoriginating from the same phrase axe sisters, andhence can be ordered by LPCs.
We use LPCs  toaccount for multiple extraposition from the sameantecedent (cf.
the data in (13)-(16)):(36) a. H < Eb.
E \[HEAD prep\] < E \[HEAD verb V rel\]The constraint in (36a) orders the EXTRA-DTRS(E) after the HEAD-DTR (H).
With regard to theEXTRA-DTRS, PPs have to precede sentences orrelative clauses, as stated in (36b).2.4 ExamplesThe (simplified) tree structures for (6) and (3) aregiven in (37) and (38):(37) S1 VP \[~HIEX {~}J AP aghast DRany longerJ PER left \]see N P ~  El}no argument(38)r51NPS\[PERextra\]\[I~HIEX {\[i\] }\] \[i\]PP\[INHfEX {\[\]}\] "J with red haira man came into the room3042.5 AdjunctsThe phrase structure for extraposition outlinedso far has to be constrained further, since it al-lows adjuncts to adjoin higher than extraposedelements, which is clearly wrong.
Cf.
the followingexamples with extraposition from NP:(39)* An entirely new band rings today, \[several ofwhom are members of the congregation\] atGreat Torrington.We conclude that the application of the head-adjunct schema has to be disallowed on top ofa head-extra structure.
This can be achievedstraightforwardly by specifying adjuncts as\[MODILOClPER non-extra\].2.6 Extraposit ion from VPThe AELR has to be restricted language-specifically to account corectly for extrapositionfrom VP:English has a head-initial VP, therefore the rightperiphery of the VP cannot be formed by theverb, but is provided by VP adjuncts (adverbs andPPs).
As a consequence, extraposed VP adjunctscannot be distinguished from VP adjuncts in baseposition, which is clearly undesirable.
Therefore,we restrict he AELR to nouns on the input side,which disallows adjunct extraposition from VPand hence avoids spurious ambiguities.In German, in contrast, the AELR can applyin full generality.
German has a head-final VP,which entails that a verb in final position can formthe right periphery of a phrase, making extrapo-sition of VP adjuncts and complements possible.We exploit of the lexical constraint in the PMCin (35b) to allow the binding of extraposed ele-ments on top of verbs in final position, which weassume with Pollard (1990) to be marked \[INV --\].We can therefore formulate the following lexicalrequirement:9(40) \[INV --\] ~ \[PER right\]All other lexical entries are marked \[PER left\], andhence cannot introduce a right periphery.2.7 FrontingTo account for the differences between English andGerman concerning the fronting from extraposedelements (cf.
(24) vs. (25)) we restrict he head-extra schema s follows:For English we assume that both INHERISLASHand INHER\[EXTRA have to be empty for all ele-ments of EXTRA-DTRS.
This guarantees that nei-9A similar ule has to be formulated for verbs withseparable prefixes, where the prefix marks the rightperiphery.ther fronting nor further extraposition is possiblefrom extraposed phrases.For German we assume that only INHERIEXTRAhas to be empty for all elements of EXTRA-DTRS.Therefore, fronting but not extraposition is al-lowed from extraposed phrases.3 Predict ions and Generalizations3.1 Extraposition and CoordinationThe head-extra schema together with the PMChas the consequence that elements extraposedfrom objects are bound at VP level, whereas extra-position from subjects involves binding at S level,as illustrated in (37) and (38).
This is confirmedby the following coordination data, which showsthat an element which is extraposed form the sub-ject cannot occur at VP level:(41) Is Nobody must live here and benefit fromincome support\] [who is earning more thantwenty pounds a week\].
(42)*Nobody must \[vplive here \]\[who is earn-ing more than twenty pounds a week\] and\[vP benefit from income support\].We find similar data for German, where the sub-ject of a finite clause is related to the S projec-tion via a SLASH dependency, and therefore thehead-extra schema pplies on top of the head-fillerschema:(43) Is, Die Behauptung iiberrraschte r ich undthe claim surprised me anderstaunte Maria\], \[dab Rauchen ung.
ist\].puzzled Maria that smoking unh.
is(44)*Die Behauptung Isfiberrraschte mich\] \[da~Rauchen ungesund ist\] und \[s erstaunteMaria\].The Coordination Principle (Pollard/Sag1994: 202) requires for coordinate structuresthat the CAT and NONLOC value of each conjunctdaughter is identical to that of the mother.
If weadd the assumption that the mother is alwaysmarked as \[PER right\], 1?
then the following datawith split antecedents can be accounted for:(45) Ein Mann ~iut3erte die Behauptung und einea man uttered the claim and aFrau leugnete die Tatsache daft Rauchenwoman denied the fact that smokingungesund ist.unhealthy is.Here EXTRA is shared between the conjuncts andbound at S level.
Parallel examples exist for En-glish:1?Note that this is possible as the PMC is valid onlyfor headed structures.
We also draw on the fact thatPER is a LOCAL feature.305(46) A man came in and a woman went out whoknew each other well.
(CR)3.2 NP- in terna l  Ext rapos i t ionWe also find evidence for extraposed phases withinNPs, i.e., examples in which adjuncts precedecomplements:(47) In \[NP an interview \[published yesterday\]\[with the Los Angeles Daily News\]\], Mr. Sim-mons said: "Lockheed is actually just a de-coy.
(...)" (uP)(48) "The question" at \[NP a closed-door meeting\[K mart is scheduled to hold today\] \[with an-alysts\]\] "will be: Why aren't we seeing betterimprovement in sales?"
(UP)These data are not unexpected in our account,since we posit no fixed position for extraposition,and hence allow that an extraposed NP comple-ment is bound inside the NP itself, provided thatan adjunct is present o mark the right peripheryof the NP.
This is the case in (47) and (48).3.3 VP- in terna l  Ext rapos i t ionMuch in the same vein as with NP-internal ex-traposition, our account accommodates cases ofVP-internal extraposition, which are possible withfronted partial VPs in German:(49) \[vp \[Einen Hund fiittern\], \[der Hunger hat\]\],a dog feed which hunger haswird wohl jeder diirfen.
(Net)will PART everyone be-allowed(50)* Es wird wohl jeder \[vP \[einen Hund ffittern\],der Hunger hat\], dfirfen.
(Net)The contrast between (49) and (50) shows thatextraposition i side a VP is possible only if theVP is fronted.
If we assume with Nerbonne (1994)that partial VPs exist in fronted position, but notin the matrix clause, this contrast is readily pre-dicted by our account.
Only in fronting exampleslike (49), the VP does form a separate constituentand hence does exhibit the periphery markingneeded for extraposition.3.4 Genera l izat ionsWe sum up the generalizations that are capturedby our analysis:(a) Relative clauses, sentences, and PPs can beextraposed, nouns and verbs can function asantecedents.
These category restrictions aresubject o crosslinguistic variation, as the theAELR for English shows (cf.
sec.
2.6).
(b) Both extraposition from fronted phrases andfronting from extraposed elements axe ac-counted for by our head-extra schema whichis constrained by the PMC.
In English,fronting from extraposed constituents i  dis-allowed by a language-specific constraint.
(c) The PMC also entails a nesting require-ment for extraposed elements with distinctantecedents.
Extraposed elements with thesame antecedent are bound at the same leveland LPCs apply.
For English and German,PPs have to precede sentential material.
Forother languages, different orderings may bestated.
(d) The fact that no island constraints for extra-position exist follows from our use of EXTRA:Island restrictions are formulated for SLASHand hence do not apply to extraposition.
(e) The upward boundedness of extrapositioncan be captured by stating that a sentencehas to be \[INHERIEXTRA { }\].
(f) Our analysis predicts the asymmetry be-tween extraposition from subjects and ob-jects as found e.g.
in coordination data.
(g) NP-internal extraposition and extrapositionwithin fronted VPs are captured without heassumption of any further mechanisms.ReferencesCulicover, Peter, Michael Rochemont (1990): Extra-position and the Complement Principle.
