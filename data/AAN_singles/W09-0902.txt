large ?
number ?
of ?
computational ?
language?learners?have?been?proposed?for?modelling?the?process ?of?child?language?acquisition.
?
?Com?paring?them,?however,?can?be?difficult?due?to?the?different ?assumptions?that?

the?diverse?test?results?presented,?and?the?different?linguistic?behaviours?investigated.?

toolkit ?
that ?allows?different ?

to ?be?
trained, ?

?The?res?ults?can?be?easily?compared?with?one?another?and ?with?
typical ?child ?

in ?understanding ?
the ?

?Many?such?models?have?been?produced?in?recent ?years, ?
tackling?various?linguistic?behaviours.?
?Like?in?any?relatively?new?domain ?of ?
research, ?
however, ?
the ?
treatment ?
of?one?problem?often?reveals?the?presence?of?several?more?that?in?turn?require?new?solutions?of?their?own.?
?This?has?led?to?the?design?and?implementa?tion ?
of ?
numerous ?
learners ?
that ?
differ ?
in ?
either?subtle?or?fundamental?ways.?
?Given?such?variety,?it?is?not?yet?clear?which?kind?of?model,?or?com?bination?of?models,?can?best?account?for?the?over?all?behaviour?witnessed?during?child?language?de?velopment.When ?
surveying ?
the ?
computational ?
language?acquisition?literature,?the?relative?advantages?and?disadvantages ?
of ?
language ?
learners ?
are ?
not ?
al?ways?clear.?
?As?such,?it?can?be?very?difficult?to?compare?different?learners?with?one?another.??The?main?problem?is?the?lack?of?standardisation?in?the?field.
?
?
Language ?
learners ?
are ?
constructed ?
with?different?underlying?assumptions,?largely?due?to?the ?
lack ?
of ?
consensus ?
in ?
linguistic ?
theory, ?
are?trained?using?different?data?
(that?can?vary?from?miniature ?
languages ?
to ?
full ?
blown ?
natural ?
lan?guages) ?
and ?
are ?
tested ?
using ?
different ?
testing?measures ?
(some ?
of ?
which ?
include ?
the ?
'Looks?good?to?me'?approach).In ?
this ?
paper, ?
a ?
toolkit ?
for ?
investigating ?
the?computational ?
modelling ?
of ?
child ?
language ?
ac?quisition?is?proposed.??The?Language?Acquisition?Toolkit?
(LAT)?allows?researchers?to?work?collab?oratively?in?solving?the?modelling?task,?while?ad?dressing ?
the ?problems?
introduced.
?
?
It ?
is?
an ?at?tempt ?
to ?bring ?
the ?
field ?
forward ?by ?
creating ?a?standardised ?way ?
for ?
testing ?and ?
implementing?language ?
acquisition ?
learners.
?
?
The ?
issues ?
ad?dressed?in?this?paper?are?largely?driven?by?engin?eering ?
concerns ?
although ?
the ?
choices ?
that ?
are?made?by ?
the?modeller ?will ?
impact ?not ?only ?on?their?learner?but?also?on?the?associated?language?theory.?
?The?driving?motivation?behind?the?LAT?is?that?the?best?way?to?compare?different?language?learners?
is ?
to?compare?
the?behaviours?
that ?
they?produce.?
?The?closer?a?learner's?behaviour?is?to?the?behaviour?witnessed?in?children,?the?better?the?model.The?LAT?is ?a?computational ?framework?that?can?train,?test?and?analyse?the?linguistic?perform?ance?of?a?computational?language?learner?in?order?to ?
chart ?
developmental ?
linguistic ?
trajectories.
?The ?motivation ?
for ?
the ?
LAT?
shall ?
first ?
be ?
ex?plored?before?describing?it?in?detail,?discussing?its?features?and?considering?future?directions.102 BackgroundThe?process?of?modelling?child?language?acquisi?tion ?
is ?
very ?
complex, ?
as ?many ?of ?
the ?
first ?
at?tempts?confirmed?(Feldman?et?al.,?1990;?Suppes,?Liang?&?Bottner,?1991).?
?Rather?than?modelling?the?process?in?entirety,?an?undoubtedly?daunting?task, ?modellers?
took?the?simplified?approach?of?focusing ?
upon ?
individual ?
linguistic ?
behaviours,?leading ?
to ?
much ?
research ?
into ?
relatively ?
con?strained ?
problems ?
such ?
as ?understanding ?
over??and?under?generalisation?errors?(Plunkett,?Sinha,?Moller?&?Strandsby,?1992),?single?word?learning?
(Regier, ?
2005), ?
syntactic ?
category ?
acquisition?
(Redington, ?
Chater ?
& ?
Finch, ?
1988) ?
and ?
past?tense?learning?(Rumelhart?&?Mcclelland,?1986).
?While?such?models?have?led?to?valuable?insights?in?the?domain,?it?can?be?difficult?to?see?how?each?of?them?is?related?to?one?another?given?the?lack?of?standardised?learning,?testing?and?analysis.Often, ?
the ?
variety ?
found ?
in ?
computational?models ?reflects ?
the ?divisions ?between?
linguistic?theories?pertaining?to?child?language?acquisition?(Kaplan,?Oudeyer?&?Bergen,?2008).?
?Given?that?linguists?remain?divided?about?how?children?learn?language,?it?is?not?surprising?to?find?a?similar?di?vision ?
in ?
the ?
computational ?
modelling ?
com?munity?as?well.?
?One?of?the?fundamental?issues?that?separates?modellers?is?the?kind?of?data?that?the?learner?learns.?
?This?can?range?from?the?use?of?plain ?
textual ?
data ?
(Elman, ?
1993), ?
to ?
grounded?sensor?based ?
input ?
(Roy, ?2008).
?
?Standardising?the?type?of?learning?data?would?thus?be?useful?for?comparing?language?learners.Typical?computational?models?are?often?tested?under?different?circumstances?and?using?different?techniques.?
?For?example,?while?some?papers?of?fer?a?general?analysis?of?the?model's?behaviour,?others ?
focus ?on ?particular ?
features, ?while ?some?test ?
language ?
comprehension, ?
others ?
test ?
lan?guage?production,?and?while?some?consider?de?velopmental ?
growth, ?
others ?
consider ?
only ?
the?start?and?end?points?of?training.?
?Although?this?is?often ?
justifiable ?
in ?
the ?
context ?
of ?
the ?
research?problem,?it?makes?it?difficult?to?directly?compare?two?models.??It?would?be?useful?to?put?all?models?through?the?same?set?of?rigorous?tests?in?order?to?find?out?how?they?are?similar?and?how?they?differ?from?one?another.?
?Such?standardised?testing?will?often?reveal?important?differences?that?may?have?previously?been?hidden.Practically, ?however, ?not ?all ?models ?
that ?are?described?in?the?literature?are?made?available?for?download.??As?a?result,?researchers?often?have?to?spend?time?recreating?models.?
?This?assumes,?of?course, ?
that ?
the ?
model ?
has ?
been ?
described ?
in?enough?detail?that?it?can?be ?faithfully?
recreated.?Much?time?could?be?saved?if?such?models?were?available?for?download,?from?a?common?reposit?ory,?such?as?the?Weka?makes?machine?learning?algorithms?freely?available?
in ?a?software?work?bench?(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/).A?good?language?learner?should?not?just?solve?language?learning?problems,?but?should?do?so?in?a?similar?way?as?is?witnessed?in?children.?
?Based?on?psycho?linguistic ?
evidence, ?
several ?
linguistic?timetables?have?been?derived?containing?import?ant?linguistic?milestones ?(Brown,?1973;?Ingram,?1989;?Pinker,?1994;?Tomasello,?2005).?
?The?char?acter ?
of ?
language ?
development ?
is ?
a ?
significant?feature?in?child?language?acquisition?and?model?lers?should?be?encouraged?to?model ?it ?
to?better?understand?the?process.?
?A?language?learner?that?demonstrates?a?good?use?of ?syntax?at ?
the?same?time?as?producing?its?first?words?is?not?very?real?istic.??Instead,?there?should?be?a?prolonged?period?in?which?words?are?learned?followed?by?the?emer?gence?of?syntax.?
?Unfortunately,?a?language?mod?el ?
can ?often ?produce ?behaviours ?at ?
unexpected?times, ?
signalling ?
a ?
problem ?
with ?
the ?
linguistic?theory?that?it?embodies.?
?A?standardised?approach?to?analysing?the?linguistic?development?of?a?lan?guage?learner?would?be?an?advantage.3 The?Language?Acquisition?Toolkit3.1 IntroductionThe ?
Language ?
Acquisition ?
Toolkit ?
(LAT) ?
is ?
a?piece?of?software?that?allows?researchers?to?de?velop ?and ?
test ?
computational ?
language ?
learners?within?a?standardised?environment.?
?The?LAT's?target?users?are?researchers?who?have?basic?skills?in?software?development?and?are?comfortable?us?ing?the?programming?language?Java.?
?It?assumes?that?the?language?learner?operates?under?the?re?strictions ?
imposed ?
in ?
the ?
miniature ?
language?paradigm?(Feldman?
et?al.,?1990).?
?The?LAT?can?be?obtained?from?www.langac.com?and?is?avail?able ?under ?a ?GNU?public ?
license?meaning?
that?the?code?can?be?reproduced?and?modified?without?obtaining?permission.The?LAT?is?an?attempt?to?standardise?the?train?ing, ?
testing ?and ?analysing ?of ?
language ?
learners?within?an?open?an?accessible?environment?(Figure?1).?
?In?training,?the?language?learner?observes?a?11simulated?world?in?which?action?based?events?oc?cur.??Both?simulated?descriptions?and?visual?data?are?sent?to?the?language?learner?for?analysis.??The?LAT?then?tests?both?the?language?learner's?com?prehension?and?production?capacities.
?
?Compre?hension?is?tested?by?sending?a?description?to?the?language?learner?and?scoring?the?visual?data?that?are?produced.?
?Similarly,?production?is?tested?by?sending?visual?data?to?language?learner?and?scor?ing ?
the ?descriptions ?produced.
?
?The ?LAT?
then?analyses?the?results?obtained?from?testing?and?de?velops?data?describing?the?learner's?development.Figure?1:?LAT?Overview.??A?language?learner?is?placed?in?the?LAT's?simulated?world?where?it?learns?from?simulated?audio?and?visual?data.??The?LAT?tests?the?learner?
?and?the?results?are?used?to?produce?data?describing?its?development.3.2 TrainingThe?LAT?can?be?configured?to?train?different?language?learners?by?generating?a?simulated?en?vironment ?
in ?which ?
action?based ?
events ?
occur.
?The ?
simulated ?environment ?operates ?within ?
the?miniature ?
language ?acquisition ?paradigm ?(Feld?man?
et?al.,?1990),?a?simplified?simulation?of?the?real?world.??A?simulation?is?employed?rather?than?grounding?the?model?in?the?real?world?in?order?to?better?control?the?number?and?type?of?problems?that?are?being?investigated?in?a?single?experiment.
?While?the?miniature?language?paradigm?imposes?a?number?of?constraints,?the?proposed?simulation?contains?enough?complexity?to?justify?its?use.The ?
learner ?
is ?
trained ?by ?watching ?an ?event?that?is?simulated?in?the?blocks?world?in?which?a?number ?
of ?
geometric ?
objects ?
can ?
be ?
found.?When?an?event?occurs,?a?symbolic?representation?of?the?description?and?visual?data?are?generated.
?More?concretely,?an?event?is?the?pairing?of?a?sim?ulated ?
description ?
and ?
a ?
action, ?
e=?d , a?
.?Events?are?represented?following?evidence?from?child?studies.?
?First,?it?is?assumed?that?the?learner?can ?
establish ?
a ?
triadic ?
relationship ?
between ?
an?object,?a?speaker?and?themselves?in?order?to?asso?ciate?a?description?with?an?action.?
?This?kind?of?relationship?is?typically?called?joint?attention?and?does ?
not ?
appear ?
in ?
children ?
until ?
around ?
12?months?old ?
(Tomasello, ?
1995).
?
?
As ?
such, ?
the?symbolic?content?present?in?descriptions?and?ac?tions?are?limited?to?those?found?in?child?literature?during?the?first?year?of?life.An ?
infant's ?
acoustic ?
sensitivity ?
is ?
so ?attuned?that ?
from ?
four?days?old ?
she ?
demonstrates ?
the?ability ?
to ?differentiate?between?native?and?non?native?speech?(Mehler?
et ?al., ?1988).
?
?Such?dis?crimination?lies?in?rhythmic?properties?that?differ?over ?
language ?
groups ?
(Dehaene?Lambertz ?
&?Houston, ?1998; ?Mehler, ?Dupoux, ?Nazzi ?&?De?haene?Lambertz, ?1996) ?and ?
is ?
likely?
to ?be ?syl?lable?based?since?infants?detect?change?in?syllable?quantity, ?
but ?
not ?
in ?
phoneme ?
quantity ?
over?samples?of?speech?(Bijeljac?Babic,?Bertoncini?&?Mehler,?1993).??Infants?also?detect?vowel?change,?a?syllable?covariant,?more?readily?than?consonant?change?(Bertoncini?et?al.,?1988),?further?support?ing?a?syllabic?base.?
?A?description?is?thus?repres?ented ?as ?a ?non?zero ?
length ?ordered ?
list ?of ?
syl?lables?in?the?LAT.?
?Word?segmentations?are?not?included?as?there?is?no?acoustic?equivalent?of?the?blank?space?in?written?language.In ?
terms ?
of ?
visual ?
sensitivity, ?
infants ?
can?identify ?objects ?
through ?
retinal ?
and ?object ?
dis?placement ?during?motion?from?four?months?old?
(Kellman,?Gleitman?&?Spelke,?1987),?and?make?relative ?
spacial ?
distinctions ?
between ?
left ?
and?right, ?
and ?above ?
and ?below, ?
from?
three ?
to ?
ten?months?old?(Quinn?&?Schyns,?2003).??Infants?can?also?make?use?of?shape?and?colour?to?differentiate?between?objects?in?the?first?year?of?life?(Landau,?Smith?&?Jones,?1988).?
?The?LAT?thus?describes?the?physical?properties?of?objects?that?inhabit?the?blocks?world?(e.g.?shape,?colour,?size?and?posi?tion),?referred?to?as?features.??An?action?is?defined?as?a?non?zero?length?ordered?list?of?feature?sets,?where?each?feature?set?is?associated?with?a?unique?time?interval.??A?set?of?features?describes?all?ob?jects?that?can?be?seen?in?an?event.?
?Note?that?ac?tions?in?this?terminology?do?not?relate?to?actions?in?terms?of?verbs?in?natural?language,?but?to?a?list?of ?
descriptions ?
of ?
scenes.

Properties ?

in?
the?case?of ?a?descriptive?event,?objects?do?not?change.?
?As?a?result,?action?based?events ?contain?different ?feature ?sets, ?giving?

?The?description?in?an?action?based?event?describes?the?action?while?the?description?in?a?de?scriptive?event ?describes?an?object ?

?
?Objects?can?perform?several ?actions?
in?cluding?moving,?flashing,?growing,?shrinking,?ap?pearing,?disappearing,?destroying?another?object,?hitting?another?object,?pushing?another?object?and?pulling?another?object.The?LAT?randomly?generate?events?that?can?be?used?as?training?data.??It?can?create?objects,?make?them?perform?actions,?and?describe?the?events?by?instantiating?appropriate?grammar?fragments.?
?To?encourage?the?use?of?standardised?sets?of?training?data, ?
a ?number ?of ?
sets ?of ?data ?have ?been ?
ran?domly?generated?that?each?contain?10,000?events.
?These ?data ?have ?been ?generated ?
from?different?parameters?(e.g.
?amount?of?noise,?probability?that?an ?
object ?
will ?
perform ?
an ?
action ?
in ?

(e.g.

?The?appear?ance?data?set?is?inspired?from?a?study?with?real?participants.?
?Participants?sat?in?front?of?a?com?puter?screen?that?initially?showed?a?blank?white?screen.?
?They?were?asked?to?describe?all?changes?that?were?made?to?the?screen?in?enough?detail?that?a ?
stranger ?
could ?
recreate ?
the ?
scene ?
using ?
only?their?descriptions.?
?By?pressing?a?key?on?the?key?board, ?a?new?geometric?object ?appeared?on?the?screen?and?the?change?was?described?by?the?parti?cipant.?
?While?the?addition?of?an?object?to?a?scene?appears?to?be?a?trivial?change,?participants?pro?duced ?
complex ?
linguistic ?
descriptions ?
that ?
re?vealed?a?deep?knowledge?of?their?language.?
?For?example,?descriptions?such?as??a?blue?circle?ap?peared?to?the?upper?right?of?the?green?square?at?the?bottom??and?
?a?red?circle?appeared?between?the ?
four ?
squares ?making ?
the ?
shape ?of ?
a ?
cross??
(Jack,?2005).Given ?
the ?
complexity ?
of ?
the ?
language ?
pro?duced,?a?simplified?version?the?task?was?construc?ted?in?which?only?the?appearance?of?one?object?next ?
to ?another ?object ?was?considered.
?
?By?re?stricting?the?context, ?there?is?less?demand?for?a?computational?language?learner?to?have?a?rich?se?mantic?representation?of?scenes.??This?served?as?a?reasonable?starting?point?from?which?to?conduct?the?investigation.?
?The?actions?in?the?Appearance?data?set?were?constructed?by?randomly?generating?one?object?and?placing?it?in?the?middle?of?a?3x3?grid ?
scene ?
and ?
then ?
adding ?
a ?
second ?
object,?which?was?also?randomly?generated,?in?a?differ?ent?position.??Eight?colours?and?shapes?were?used.
?Each?action?was?also?accompanied?by?an?appro?priate ?
description ?
that ?
was ?
generated ?

Con?cretely,?a?testing?set?is?a?set?of?events?where?each?event?relates?one?or?more?descriptions?to?one?or?more?actions.?
?The?set?of?testing?data?associated?with?the?Appearance?training?data?set?can?be?used?to ?
test ?
the ?
learner's ?
vocabulary, ?
certain ?
multi?word?combinations?and?full?sentences.?
?Using?the?terminology ?
found ?
in ?
Appearance's ?
grammar?fragment?
(Figure ?2),?the?LAT?tests?for?the?com?prehension?of?shapes?(SHP),?colours?(COL),?ob?jects?(Nbar),?indefinite?objects?(NP1),?definite?ob?jects?(NP2)?and?events?
(E).In ?
testing ?
the ?
learner's ?
comprehension, ?
the?LAT?sends?a?description?as?input?and?receives?a?set?of?actions?as?output.?
?The?output?is?automatic?ally ?
scored ?by ?
comparing ?
it ?with ?
the ?
expected?output ?
that ?
is ?
associated ?
with ?
the ?
description.?Actions?are?compared?based?on?the?feature?values?that?are?relevant?to?the?given?description.??Given?the?description?
?a ?ye?
low?cir ?cle ?
to?
the ?u?pper?right?of?the?blue?square??
(Figure ?3),?the?colours,?shapes ?and?relative?positions ?of ?
the?objects ?are?relevant ?
whereas ?
their ?
exact ?
positions ?
are ?
not.
?The?LAT?equally?accepts?a?yellow?circle?that?ap?pears?higher?or?further?right?than?its?idealised?po?sition?with?respect?to?the?blue?square,?as?long?as?the?relative?positions?remain?correct.Borrowing?from?research?in?child?language?ac?quisition ?
studies, ?
four ?
kinds ?
of ?
incorrect ?
re?sponses?are?identified:??over?extended;?under?ex?tended;?mismatched;?or?incorrect.?
?For?example,?the?meaning?of?the?description??square??is?under?extended?if?the?learner?only?uses?it?to?refer?to?red?squares,?blue?squares?and?green?squares,?but?not?to?squares?of?other?colours.??Similarly,?the?mean?ing?of?the?description??red?square??is?over?exten?ded?if?it?refers?to?red?squares,?blue?squares?and?red?circles.?
?A?mismatch?is?found?if?the?descrip?tion??square?
?is?used?to?refer?to?objects?other?than?squares, ?
for ?examples ?circles ?and?
triangles, ?but?never?to?squares?themselves.??Results?that?deviate?from?these?cases?are?simply?considered?incorrect.
?3211 2 33211 2 314The ?
LAT ?
can ?
score ?
both ?
single ?
words ?
and?phrases?based?on?these?categories.In?addition,?the?output?produced?by?the?learner?can?also?be?described?using?the?standard?informa?tion?retrieval ?measures ?of ?precision, ?
recall, ?and?the?e?measure?which?is?a?weighted?combination?of?the?two?former?values?
(van?Rijsbergen,?1979).The?process?of?testing?the?learner's?production?is ?
similar ?
to ?
that ?
of ?
testing ?
comprehension.?Rather?than?the?LAT?sending?a?description?as?in?put,?however,?it?sends?an?action.??The?learner?then?produces?a?set?of?descriptions?as?output.??Results?from?production?are?scored?using?the?same?prin?ciples?as?applied?during?comprehension.?
?That?is,?the?learner's?output?is?compared?to?the?expected?output?and?it?is?scored?as?either?correct,?over?ex?tended,?under?extended,?mismatched?or?incorrect.3.4 AnalysingBoth ?
the ?comprehension ?and ?production ?
res?ults ?
that ?are ?produced?
from?testing?are ?used?to?evaluate?the?learner's?linguistic?stage?of?develop?ment.
?
?Several ?types?of ?analysis ?have?been?de?signed?to?ease?learner?comparisons:?round?based;?trial?based;?and?learner?based.?
?Round?based?ana?lyses?analyse?the?results?produced?from?a?single?round ?
of ?
testing.
?
?
Trial?based ?
analyses ?
take?round?based ?
statistics ?
and ?
compare ?
them ?
with?previous ?
rounds ?
in ?
order ?
to ?
find ?
behavioural?trends ?
in ?
the ?data.
?
?Finally, ?
learner?based ?
ana?lyses?compare?trial?based?data?for?several?trials?in?order?to?extract?general?behavioural?trends.?
?By?performing?analyses?at?all?three?levels?of?detail,?a?more?complete?account?of?the?learner's?behaviour?is?produced.The?LAT?is?currently?able?to?perform?a?num?ber?of?round?based?analyses?that?are?often?found?in?the?literature:?summary?of?test?results?in?terms?of?correct?results?and?errors;?chart?the?linguistic?generativity?of?the?learner;?and?present?evidence?of?syntactic?activity.Round?based?analyses?produce?results?that?are?then?used?to?determine?the?model's?stage?of?lin?guistic ?development ?using ?data ?
from?child ?
lan?guage?studies:?pre?linguistic;?holophrastic;?early?multi?word;?late?multi?word;?and?abstract?stages.A ?
number ?
of ?
trial?based ?
analyses ?
are ?
per?formed?using?these?data,?in?order?to?identify?par?ticular ?
linguistic?behaviours: ?
linguistic?develop?ment; ?
vocabulary ?
acquisition; ?
comprehension/?production?imbalance.?
?With?the?creation?of?a?lin?guistic?development?timetable,?all ?data?can?also?be?presented?in?terms?of?stages.?
?For?example,?the?number?of ?words?
that?are?correctly?comprehen?ded?and?the?rate?of?vocabulary?acquisition?can?be?shown?by?stage.Model?based?analyses?can?performed?when?the?results?from?several?trials?are?available.??Each?of?the?results,?such?as?the?rate?of?vocabulary?acquisi?tion?during?a?stage,?are?compared?across?trials?to?identify?general?behavioural?trends.The?LAT?thus?offers?a?standardised?platform?for?training,?testing?and?analysing?language?mod?els.?
?The?results?from?all ?analyses?can?be?auto?matically?compared?to?determine?the?differences?between?learners?and?which?learner?best?fits?child?language?data.4 DiscussionThe?LAT?is?a?freely?available?tool?that?offers?a?standardised ?environment ?
from?which ?
language?modellers?can?develop?their?language?learners.??It?is?an?attempt?to?advance?the?domain?by?offering?a?platform?where?common?goals?can?be?focussed?upon?in?a?collaborative?environment.?
?It?aims?to?standardise?the?training,?testing?and?analysing?of?language?learners?by?understanding?the?needs?of?language?modellers?through?collaboration.By?using?the?LAT,?the?language?modeller?ac?cepts?the?need?to?work?with?standardised?training?data.??Such?standardisation?is?widespread?in?com?putational?linguistics.?
?For?example,?in?the?field?of?automatic?text?classification,?there?are?several?databases?of?pre?classified?documents?(e.g.
?Reu?ters?21578, ?
Reuters ?
Corpus ?
Volume ?
1 ?
and ?
20?Newsgroups)?that?researchers?can?use?to?evaluate?different?algorithms?and?to?compare?their?results.
?The?LAT?offers?different?sets?of?training?data?that?are ?
constrained ?
by ?
principles ?
of ?
the ?
miniature?language?paradigm.??In?using?such?data,?the?mod?elling?task?differs?from?the?task?that?a?child?faces?in?a?number?of?ways.?
?In?particular,?the?learning?problem?is?simplified?in?that?the?real?world?con?tains ?
many ?
more ?
objects ?
and ?
that ?
natural ?
lan?guage ?
has ?
far ?
more ?
linguistic ?
structures ?
and?words ?
than ?
the ?
language ?
fragments.
?
?
It ?
is ?
for?these?reasons,?however,?that?such?a?paradigm?is?attractive.?
?Many?language?learning?problems?can?be ?
effectively ?
investigated ?
by ?
first ?
simplifying?the ?
problem ?
and ?
then ?
developing ?
solutions.?When?such?problems?in?
the?miniature?
language?paradigm?have?been?adequately?solved,?it?is?en?visaged?that?the?LAT?can?be?grounded?in?a?real?15environment ?
where ?
vast ?
volumes ?
of ?
data ?
are?available?for?processing.The?
results ?from?learning?can?then?be?
tested?using?a?standardised?set?of?tests.?
?The?learner?is?treated ?
as ?
a ?
black ?box, ?meaning ?
that ?
the ?LAT?evaluates?
its ?output ?alone?without ?entering?
into?its?inner?workings.?
?This?helps?to?keep?the?LAT's?functionality?independent?from?the?learner?by?fo?cussing ?on ?
the?way?
in ?which ?
it ?behaves ?
rather?than?how?it?produces?particular?behaviours,?simil?ar?to?the?relationship?found?between?the?linguist?and?child?in?the?real?world.?
?By?testing?both?com?prehension?and?production?on?a?large?set?of?de?scriptions?and?actions,?a?complete?picture?of?the?learner's ?
linguistic ?
state ?
can ?
be ?
derived.
?
?
The?LAT ?
also ?
checks ?
for ?
language ?
errors ?
such ?
as?over?extensions, ?
under?extensions ?
and ?
mis?matches.?
?Individual?results?are?made?available?to?the ?
researcher ?
in ?
a ?
tabular ?
format ?
as ?
well ?
as?providing?overall?recall,?precision?and?e?measure?scores.By?standardising?the?test?results,?different?lan?guage?learners?can?be?easily?compared?with?one?another.
?
?The?LAT?can?analyse?these?results?to?discover?behavioural?trends?in?the?data?with?can?be?used?in?further?comparisons.?
?It?is?also?inter?esting?to?note?that?the?LAT?makes?an?attempt?to?compare?the?behaviour?produced?by?a?language?learner?with?that?of?children.?
?Inspired?by?child?language?development?timetables,?a?set?of?mile?stones?has?been?derived?that?are?used?to?charac?terise?the?learner's?behaviour?in?terms?of?stages.
?The ?LAT?attempts ?
to ?
encourage ?
researchers ?
to?consider ?
the ?
developmental ?
behaviour ?
of ?
their?language?learners?over?time.It?is?important?to?note?that?the?LAT?is?a?work?in?progress.?
?This?disclaimer?is?likely?to?remain?true?for?many?years.??Developing?a?gold?standard?is?a?difficult?task?and?one?that?risks?to?evolve?over?time.?
?The?LAT?should?be?regarded?as?a?proposal?for ?
standardisation.
?
?Being ?a ?collaborative?pro?ject,?any?contributor?can?challenge?this?proposal?by?offering?their?own?solutions.?
?Contributors?are?encouraged ?
to ?
create ?
their ?
own ?
data ?
and ?
al?gorithms?and?to?upload?them?to?the?LAT.?
?A?gold?standard?can?only?emerge?from?the?selections?that?are?made?by?other?modellers,?who?vote?by?using?certain?data?and?algorithms?in?their ?own?model?ling?tasks.?
?In?this?sense,?the?proposed?instanti?ation?of?the?LAT?described?in?this?article?is?less?important?than?the?idea?behind?the?LAT?itself.5 Future?ConsiderationsIn ?designing?
the ?LAT, ?
it ?quickly?became?clear?that?the?task?was?not?straight?forward.?
?Designing?a ?
tool ?
that ?
can ?
make ?
useful ?
and ?
standardised?comparisons?between?language?learners?is?a?com?plex?task.?
?A?balancing?act?between?not?excluding?certain ?
types ?
of ?
learners ?
and ?
creating ?
a ?
con?strained,?manageable?environment?is?not?without?its?difficulties.?
?As?such,?it?is?worth?considering?future?developments?for?the?LAT.??While?still?in?a?preliminary?state?of?development,?it?is?hoped?that?a?collaborative?approach?to?the?task?will?allow?it?to?be?steered?in?the?directions?that?are?best?adap?ted?to?its?potential?users.?
?A?number?of?these?dir?ections?are?now?considered.The ?
miniature ?
language ?
paradigm ?
is ?
at ?
the?heart?of?the?LAT.??This?language?can?be?extended?to?include?more?complex?linguistic?constructions?and?a?
larger?vocabulary.?
?
It ?
is?suggested?that ?a?systematic ?
approach ?
is ?
followed ?
in ?
which ?
the?learning?task?is?made?progressively?complex?by?adding ?
linguistic ?
features ?
that ?
tend ?
to ?
be ?
wit?nessed?in?children?during?development.??It?seems?reasonable?to?follow?a?
?longitudinal?approach?to?development.?
?Contributors?are?also?encouraged?to?create?and?submit?new?training?data?sets?in?or?der?to?explore?how?complex?a?miniature?language?can?become.The?type?of?information?that?is?available?to?the?learner?could?also?be?changed.
?
?At?present, ?
the?descriptions ?
lack ?
acoustic ?
information ?
such ?
as?tone.??Such?data?is?indispensable?in?investigating?certain?languages?such?as?Mandarin?and?Swahili.?Similarly,?the?symbolic?representations?of?visual?objects?can?be?refined?to?better?represent?reality.
?Colours?can?be?represented?by?RGB?values?rather?than ?
linguistically?related ?
symbols, ?
as ?
it ?
is ?
un?likely?that?children?start?with?such?pre?defined?se?mantic?categories?from?the?outset?of?learning.It ?
is ?also?worthwhile ?considering?more?com?plex?testing?and?analysis?algorithms.?
?It?is?likely?that?they?will?be?developed?in?step?with?new?lin?guistic?phenomena?that?are?investigated,?building?a?useful?catalogue?of?tools.?
?In?addition,?it?may?be?useful ?
to ?
develop ?
learner?dependant ?
analysis?tools?in?order?to?demonstrate?how?the?inner?work?ings?are?related?to?the?outward?behaviour.Finally,?it?is?hoped?that?the?LAT?will?become?a?useful ?
resource ?not ?
just ?
for ?modellers ?who ?are?comfortable?with?coding?but ?also?non?program?mers.??They?should?be?able?to?implement?and?ex?periment?with?different?kinds?of?models?with?the?16flexibility?of?
looking?at?different ?aspects?of?ac?quisition?under?different?settings?and?with?differ?ent?types?of?data.??They?can?then?inform?language?modellers?directly?about?how?particular?language?models?perform?well?and?poorly?in?certain?cases.
?The?collaborative?aspect?of?the?LAT?encourages?not?just?programmers?to?share?their?code,?but?for?everyone?to?share?their?ideas.6 ConclusionThis ?
article ?
proposes ?
a ?
tool ?
that ?
facilitates ?
the?consolidation?of?research?into?the?computational?modelling?of?child?language?acquisition?under?the?miniature?language?paradigm.?
?The?workshop?is?being?used?to?launch?a?first?version?of?the?LAT,?that ?
is ?
hoped ?
to ?
help ?
