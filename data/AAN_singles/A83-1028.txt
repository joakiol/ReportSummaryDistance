We pay particularattention to the reasons for our choice of certaintechn iques  over  o ther  cand idates ,  based on bothob jec t ive  and sub jec t ive  c r i te r ia .

Thus,  our "app l ied"sys tem remains  a research  veh ic le  that  serves  asan exce l lent  tes tbed  fo r  proposed new procedures .In genera l ,  the  c r i te r ia  fo r  our cho ice  ofl i ngu is t i c  and computat iona l  techn iques  a re  th ree :e f fec t iveness ,  conven ience  of use ,  and e f f i c iency .These c r i te r ia  a re  app l ied  in  a context  where theproduct ion  of an MT sys tem to be operat iona l  inthe near-term future is of critical concern.Candidate techniques which do not admit near-term,large-scale application thus suffer an over-whelmins disadvantage.
The questions confrontingus are, then, twofold: (I) which techniques admitsuch application; and (2) which of these bestsatisfy our three general criteria?
The firstquestion is usually answered through an evaluationof the likely difficulties and requirements forimplementation; the second, through empiricalresults in the course of experiments.Our evaluation of the LRC ~E system's currentstatus will be based on three points!
(a) thesystem's provision of all the tools necessary forusers to effect the complete translation process(including text processing, editing, terminologymeinten~ok-up ,  etc.

However, as  yet  no s t rong  case  hasbeen advanced fo r  the  abandonment of  syntax .Moreover,  no system has been de le loped  by any ofthe  adherents  of the  "semant ics  on ly"  schoo l  ofthought  that  has more -or - less  success fu l l y  dea l tw i th  ALL of  a v ide  range  - -  or  a t  leas t  la rgevolume - -  of ~ater ia l .
A more damaging argumentaga ins t  th i s  schoo l  i s  that  every  NLP sys tem todate  that  HAS been app l ied  Co la rge  vo lumes  oftext  ( in  the  a t tempt  to p rocess  ALL of i t  somas ign i f i cant  sense)  has  been based on a s t rongsyntact i c  model of l anguage  (see, e.g., \ [Boater  ete l .

(Th is  has  been a long-s tand ingpos i t ion  in  the  l ingu is t i c  community,  be ing  uphe ldthere  be fore  most computat iona l  inguists jumpedon the  bandwagon; i ron ica l l y ,  th i s  pos i t ion  is novbe ing  cha l lenged by some wi th in  the  l ingu is t i ccommunity itself, who are once again supporting PSru les  as a model of  natura l  l anguage  use  \ [Gazdar ,1981\].)

But cascadedATNs \[Woods, 1980\] ,  fo r  example,  a re  on lymarg ina l ly  d i f fe rent  from PS ru le  sys tems.
I t  i scur ious  to note  that  on ly  one of the  remain ingcontenders  (s  t rans format iona l  g r - - , - - r  \[Damerau,1981\])  has been demonst ra ted  in  la rge-sca leapp l i ca t ion  - -  and even th i s  sys tem employs PSru les  in the  initial s tages  of parsing.
Otherformal sys tems (e .g .
,  p rocedura l  gr=mm-rs\ [Winograd, 1972\]) have been app l ied  tosemantically deep (but linguisticallyLmpover ished) domains - -  or Co excess ive ly  l J Jniceddomains (e.g., Smell's \[1980\] "word expert" parserseems to have encompassed a vocabulary of lessthan 20 items).For p rac t i ca l  app l i ca t ion ,  i t  is necessarythaca  sys tem be ab le  co accumulate  grammar ru les ,and espec ia l l y  lex ica l  i tems,  aca  prod ig ious  ra teby current NLP standards.
The formalismscompeting with PS rules and dictionary entries ofmodest size seem to be universally characterizableas requiring enormous human resources for theirimplementation in even a moderately largeenvironment.
This should not be surprising: it isprecisely the claim of these competingmethodologies (chose Chac are ocher than slightvariations on PS rules) that language is anexceedingly complex phenomenon, requiring167cor respond ing ly  complex techn iques  to model .
For"deep unders tand ing"  app l i ca t ions ,  we do noccontes t  th i s  c la im.
But we do mainta in  chat  therea re  some app l i ca t ions  that  do not  seem to requ i reth i s  leve l  of  e f fo r t  fo r  adequate  resu l t s  in  ap rac t i ca l  se t t ing .

By the time thisconference  convenes ,  we w i l l  have begun theprocess  of  add ing to the  sys tem an ana lys i sgrammar of  the  cur rent  TL (Eng l i sh ) ,  so that  thed i rec t ion  of  t rans la t ion  may be reversed ;  weant i c ipate  br ing ing  the  Eng l i sh  grammar up to theleve l  of  the  German gr2m~ar in  about  a year ' st ime.

Syntact i c  FeaturesOur use  of syntact i c  features  i s  re la t ive lynoncont rovers ia l ,  g iven  our cho ice  of  the  PS ru leformalism.
We employ syntactic features for twopurposes.
One is the usual practice of using suchfeatures to restrict the application of PS rules(e .g .
,  by en forc ing  sub jec t -verb  numberagreement ) .
The o ther  use i s  perhaps  pecu l ia r  toour type of app l i ca t ion :  once an ana lys i s  i sach ieved ,  cer ta in  syntact i c  features  a re  employedto cont ro l  the  course  (and outcome) of t rans la t ion- -  i .
e .
,  generat ion  of  the  TL sentence .
The"augmentat ions"  to our  PS ru les  inc lude  procedureswritten in a formal language (so that ourlinguists do not have Co learn LISP) thatmanipulate features by restricting their presence.their values if present, etc., and by moving themfrom node to node in the "parse tree" during thecourse of the analysis.
As is the case with otherresearchers employing such techniques, we havefound this to be an extremely powerful (and ofcourse necessary) means of restricting theactivities of the parser.C.
Semantic FeaturesWe employ simple semantic features, asopposed to complex models of the domain.
Ourreasons  are  pr imar i l y  p rac t i ca l .
F i r s t ,  they  seemsu f f i c ient  fo r  a t  leas t  the  in i t ia l  s tage  of ourapp l i ca t ion .
Second, the  thought  of wr i t ingcomplex models  of  even one complete  techn ica ldomain i s  s tagger ing :  the  operat ion  andmaintenance  manua ls  we ar  e cur rent ly  work ing w i th(descr ib ing  a d ig i ta l  te lephone  sw i tch ing  sys tem)are  par t  of  a document co l lec t ion  that  i s  expectedto compr i se  some 100,000 pages  of  text  whencomplete .
A research  group the  s i ze  of  ours  wouldnot  even be ab le  to read  that  vo lume of mater ia l ,much less write the "necessary" semantic modelssubsumed by i t ,  in any reasonable amount of time.
(The group would also have to become electronicsengineers, in all likelihood.)
If such models areindeed required for our application, we will neversucceed .As i t  tu rns  out ,  we are  do ing  surpr i s ing lywe l l  w i thout  such mode ls .
In  fac t ,  our  semant icfeature  sys tem i s  not  yet  be ing  employed tores t r i c t  the  ana lys i s  e f fo r t  a t  a l l ;  i ns tead ,  i ti s  used a t  " t rans fer  t ime"  (descr ibed  la ter )  toimprove the  qua l i ty  of  the  t rans la t ions ,  p r imar i l yof  p repos i t ions .
We look forward  to extend ing  theuse of  semant ic  features  to o ther  par ts  of  speech ,and to substant ive  ac t iv i ty  dur ing  ana lys i s ;  buteven we were p leased  a t  the  resu l t s  we ach ievedusing only syntactic features.D.
Scored In terpreta t ionsI t  i s  a we l l -known fac t  that  NLP sys tems tendto produce many read ings  of  the i r  input  sentences(un less ,  of course ,  const ra ined  to produce thefirst reading only -- which can result in the"right" interpretation being overlooked).
The LRCMT system produces all interpretations of theinput "sentence" and assigns each of them a score,or plausibility factor \[Robinson, 1982\].
Thistechnique can be used, in theory, to select a"best" interpretation from the possible readingsof an ambiguous sentence.
We base our scores onboth lexical and grammatical phenomena -- plus thetypes of any spelling/typographical errors, whichcan sometimes be "corrected" in more than one way.Our exper iences  re la t ing  to the  re l iab i l i tyand s tab i l i ty  of heur i s t i cs  based on th i stechn ique  are  dec ided ly  pos i t i ve :  we employ on lythe  (or  a) h ighest -scor ing  read ing  fo r  t rans la t ion( the  o thers  be ing  d i scarded) ,  and our  in fo rmalexper iments  ind icate  that  i t  i s  very  ra re ly  t ruethat  a bet te r  t rans la t ion  resu l t s  f rom alower -scor ing  ana lys i s .
(Surpr i s ing ly  o f ten ,  anumber of the  h igher -scor ing  in terpreta t ions  w i l lbe t rans la ted  ident i ca l l y .

(Ac tua l ly ,  both  s ty lesa re  ava i lab le ,  but  our  l ingu is ts  have never  seenthe need or practicality of employing the open-ended variety).
It is clearly more efficient toindex tranoformations to specif ic rules whenpossible; the import of our findings is that itseems to be unnecessary to have open-endedtransformations -- even during analysis, when onemight intuitively expect them to be useful.F.
T rans fer  ComponentI t  i s  f requent ly  a rgued that  t rans la t ionshou ld  be a process  of  ana lyz ing  the  SourceLanguage (SL) in to  a "deep representat ion"  of  somesort, then directly synthesizing the TargetLanguage (TL) (e.g., \[Carbonnel, 1978\]).
We andothers \[King, 1981\] contest this claim --especially with regard to "similar languages"(e.g., those in the Indo-European family).
Oneobjection is based on large-scale, long-termtrials of the "deep representation" (in MT.
calledthe "pivot language") technique by the MT group atGrenoble \[Boitet, 1980a\].
After an enormousinvestment in time and energy, includin Eexperiments with massive amounts of text, it wasdecided that the development of a suitable pivotlanguage (for use in Russian-French translation)was probably impossible.
Another objection isbased on practical considerations: since it is notlikely that any NLP system will in the foreseeablefuture become capable of handling unrestrictedinput -- even in the technical area(s) for whichit might be designed -- it is clear that a"fail-soft" technique is necessary.
It is notobvious that such is possible in a system basedsolely on a pivot language; a hybrid systemcapable of dealing with shallower levels ofunderstanding is necessary in a practical setting.This being the case, it seems better in near-termapplications to start off with a system employinga "shallow" but usable level of analysis, anddeepen the level of analysis as experiencedictates, and resources permit.Our alternative is to have a "transfer"component which maps "shallow analyses ofsentences" in the SL into "shallow analyses ofequivalent sentences" in the TL, from whichsynthesis then takes place.
While we and the restof the NLP community continue to debate the natureof an adequate pivot language (i.e., the nature ofdeep semantic models and the processing theyentail), we can hopefully proceed to construct ausable system capable of progressive enhancementas linguistic theory becomes able to supportdeeper  mode ls .G.
A t tached  Trans la t ion  P roceduresE.
Indexed TransformationsWe employ a t rans format iona l  component ,dur ing  both the ana lys i s  phase and the  t rans la t ionphase.
The transformations, however, are indexedto specific syntax rules rather than loosely keyedOur Transfer procedures (which effect theactual translation of SL into TL) are tightlyhound to nodes in the analysis (parse tree)structure \[Paxton, 1977\].
They are, in effect,suspended procedures -- the same procedures thatconstructed the corresponding parse tree nodes tobegin with.
This is to be preferred over a more168genera l ,  loose assoc ia t ion  based on syntact i cconst ruc ts  because,  as ide from i t s  advantage insheer computat ional  e f f i c iency ,  i t  e l im inates  theposs ib i l i ty  that  the '~rong"  procedure can beappl ied to a const ruc t .
The only real  argumentaga ins t  th i s  techn ique,  as we see i t ,  i s  based onspace cons iderat ions :  to the extent  that  d i f fe rentconst ruc ts  share the same t rans fer  operat ions ,rep l i ca t ion  of the procedures chat /~plemenc sa idoperat ions  (and ed i t ing  e f fo r t  to modify them) i sposs ib le .
We have not not iced th i s  to be aproblem.
For a whi le ,  our system load-upprocedure searched fo r  dup l i ca tes  of th i s  natureand e l iminated  them; however, the ga ins  turned outto be minimal N d i f fe rent  const ruc ts  typ ica l ly  dorequ i re  d i f fe rent  operet ions .llI COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES ~qFLOYEDAgain, our separat ion  of " l ingu is t i c "  from"computat ional"  techniques i s  somewhat a r t i f i c ia l .but never the less  use fu l .
In th i s  sec t ion  wepresent  the reasons for  our use of the fo l lowingcmaputat ion~l techn iques :  (a) an a l l -paths ,bottom-up parser ;  (b) assoc ia ted  ru le-bodyprocedures;  (c) spe l l ing  cor rec t ion ;  (d) anotherfa i l - so f t  ana lys i s  technique;  and (e) recurs lvepars ing  of parenthet i ca l  express ions .A.
A l l -paths ,  Bottom-up PerserAmong a l l  our choices of computat ionaltechn iques ,  the use of an a l l -paths ,  bottom-upparser  i s  probably the most cont rovers ia l .
I ta lso  rece ived our g reates t  exper imental  sc ru t iny .We have co l lec ted  ?
substant ia l  body of empir ica levidence re la t ing  Co pars ing  techn iques .
Sincethe evidence and conc lus ions  requ i re  lengthyd i scuss ion ,  and are presented elsewhere \[Slocum,1981\], we w i l l  only b r ie f ly  s~r i ze  the resu l t s .The evidence ind icates  that  our use of ana l l -paths  bottom-up parser  i s  jus t i f i ed ,  g iven thecurrent state of the art in ComputationalLinguistics.
Our reasons are the following:first, the dreaded "exponential explosion" ofprocessing time has not appeared (and our sr---~=rand tes t  texts  are among the la rgest  in thewor ld) ,  but ins tead ,  process ing time appears Co bel inear  with sentence length  - -  even though oursystem produces a l l  poss ib le  in terpreta t ions ;second, top-down pars ing methods su f fe r  inherentd isadvantages  in e f f i c iency ,  and bottom-up parserscan be and have been augmented with "top-downfiltering" to restrict the syntax rules applied tothose that an all-paths top-down parser wouldapply; th i rd ,  i t  is  d i f f i cu l t  to persuade atop-down parser  to cont inue the ana lys i s  e f fo r t  tothe end of the sentence,  when i t  blocks somewherein the middle - -  which makes the implementat ion of"fail-soft" techniques that  much more difficult;and lastly, the lack of any strong notion of howto construct a "best-path" parser, coupled withthe raw speed of well-unplemented parsers, impliesthat an all-paths parser which scoresinterpretations and can continue the analysis tothe end of the sentence is best in a practicalapplication such as ours.169B.
Assoc ia ted  Rule-body ProceduresWe assoc ia te  a procedure d i rec t ly  with eachind iv idua l  syntax  ru le ,  and eva luate  i t  as soon asthe parser  determines the ru le  to be (seemingly)app l i cab le  \ [P ra t t ,  1973; Hendrix,  1978\] - -  hencethe term "ru le-body procedure" .
This p rac t i ce  i sequ iva lent  to what i s  done in ATN systems.
Fromthe linguist's point of view, the contents of ourru le-body procedures appear to  const i tu te  a fo rmallanguage dealing with syntecCic and semanticfeatures /va lues  of nodes in the t ree  - -  i .
e .
,  noknovledse of LISP i s  necessary  to code e f fec t iveprocedures .
Since these procedures are compiledin to  LISP, a l l  the power of LISP is  ava i lab le  asnecessary .
The ch ie f  l i ngu is t  on our p ro jec t ,  whohas ?
vague knowledge of LISP, has employed OR andAND operators  to a s ign i f i cant  extent  (we d idn ' tbother  to inc lude them in the spec i f i ca t ions  o fthe formal language,  though we obv ious ly  couldhave) ,  and on rare  occas ions  has resor ted  to us ingCOND.
No other  ca l l s  to t rue LISP funct ions  (asopposed to our formal operators ,  which are few andtyp ica l ly  qu i te  p r imi t ive )  have seemed necessary .nor has th i s  capab i l i ty  been requested ,  to date .The power of our ru le -body procedures eems to l i ein  the choice of features /va lues  that  decorate thenodes, ra ther  than the process in  E capab i l i t i es  ofthe procedures themse lves .C.
Spe l l ing  Correct ionThere are l im i ta t ions  and dansers  to spe l l ingcor rec t ion  in  genera l ,  but we have found i t  to bean indispensable component of an applied system.People do make spe l l ing  and typograph ica l  e r ro rs ,as i s  wel l  known; even in  "po l i shed"  documentsthey appear with surpr i s ing  f requency (about everyother  PaSe, in  our exper ience) .
Arguments by LISPprogrammers ( re :  INTERLISP's DWIM) as ide ,  users  ofappl ied NLP systems d is t inc t ly  d i s l i ke  beingconfronted with requests for clarification -- or,worse, unnecessary ~ailure -- in lieu of automatedspelling correction.
Spelling correction.therefore, is necessary.Luck i ly ,  almost a l l  such er rors  are t reatab lewith simple techn iques :  s ing le - le t te r  add i t ions ,omiss ions ,  and mis takes ,  plus two- or th ree- le t te rt ranspos i t ions  account for  almost a l l  m is takes .Unfor tunate ly ,  i t  i s  not in f requent ly  the casethat there i s  more than one way to "correct" amistake (i.e., resulting in different correctedversions).
Even a human cannot always determinethe correct form in isolation, and for NLP systemsit is even more difficult.
There is yet anotherproblem with automatic spelling correction: howmuch to correct.
Given unlimited rein, any wordcan be "corrected" Co any other.
Clearly theremust be limits, but what are they?Our informal findings concerning how much onemay safely "correct" in an application such asours are these: the few errors chat simpletechniques ha~e not handled are almost alwaysbizarre (e.g., repeated syllables or largerportions of words) or highly unusual (e.g., blanksinserted within words); correction of more than aone er ror  in  a word i s  dangerous  ( i t  i s  bet te r  tot reat  the  word as unknown, hence a noun) ;  and"cor rec t ion"  of  e r ro rs  wh ich  have conver ted  oneword in to  another  (va l id  in  i so la t ion)  shou ld  notbe t r ied .D.
Fail-soft Gr~-m-tical AnalysisIn  the  event  of  fa i lu re  to ach ieve  acomprehens ive  ana lys i s  of  the  sentence ,  a sys temsuch  as ours  -- which i s  to  be app l ied  to  hundredsof thousands  of  pages  of  text  - -  cannot  indu lge  inthe  luxury  of s imp ly  rep ly ing  w i th  an er rormessage  s ta t ing  Chat the  sentence  cannot  bein terpreted .
Such behav io r  i s  a s ign i f i cantprob lem,  one which  the  NLP commuuity has  fa i led  tocome to gr ips  w i th  in  any coherent  fash ion .
Therehave ,  a t  leas t ,  been some fo rays .
We ishede l  andBlack \[1980\] discusa techniques for interactingwith the  linguist/developer to identifyinsufficiencies in the grammar.
This is fine fordeve lopment  purposes .
But ,  of  course ,  in  anapp l ied  sys tem the  user  w i l l  be ne i ther  thedeve loper  nor  a l ingu is t ,  so th i s  approach  has  nova lue  in  the  f ie ld .
Rayes and Mourad lan \[1981\]d i scuss  ways of  a l low ing  the  parser  to  cope w i thungr - - - - - t i ca l  u t te rances ;  th i s  work is i n  i t sin fancy ,  but  i t  i s  s t imu la t ing  nonethe less .
Welook forward to  experimenting with similartechniques in our system.What we requ i re  now, however ,  i s  a means ofdea l ing  w i th  "ungrammat ica l "  input  (whetherth rough the  human's  e r ro r  or the  shor tcomings  ofour own ru les )  that  i s  h igh ly  e f f i c ient ,su f f i c ient ly  genera l  to account  fo r  a la rge ,unknown range  of  such er rors  on i t s  f i r s t  out ing ,and which  can be implemented in  a shor t  per iod  oft ime.
We found jus t  such a techn ique  three  yearsago:  a spec ia l  p rocedure  ( invoked when theana lys i s  e f fo r t  has  been car r ied  th rough to theend of the  sentence)  searches  th rough the  parser ' schar t  to f ind  the  shor tes t  path  from one end tothe  o ther ;  th i s  path  represents  the  fewest ,l ongest -spann ing  phrases  which were const ruc teddur inE  the  ana lys i s .
T ies  a re  broken  by use  ofthe  s tandard  scor ing  mechanism that  p rw ides  eachphrase in the analysis with a score, orplausibility measure (discussed earlier).
We callthis procedure "phrasal analysis'.Our phrasa l  ana lys i s  techn ique  has  proven tobe use fu l  fo r  both  the  deve lopers  and theend-user ,  in  our  app l i ca t ion :  the  sys temt rans la tes  each phrase  ind iv idua l ly ,  when acomprehens ive  sentence  ana lys i s  i s  not  ava i lab le .The linguists use the results to pin-point missing(or faulty) rules.
The users (who areprofessional translators, editing the MT system'soutput) have available the best  translationposs ib le  under  the  c i rcumstances ,  ra ther  than  nousab le  output  of  any k ind .
To our  knowledge,  noo ther  NLP sys tem re l ies  on a such  a genera ltechn ique  fo r  search ing  the  parser ' s  char t  when anana lys i s  e f fo r t  has  fa i led .

We dea l  w i th  th i s  phenomenon in  thefo l low ing  way: ra ther  than  t reat ing  parentheses  aslexical items, we make use of LISP's naturaltreatment of them as list delimiters, and treatthe  resu l t ing  sub l ia ts  as  ind iv idua l  "words" inthe  sentence ;  these  '~ords" are  "lexicallyana lyzed"  v ia  recurs ive  ca l l s  to  the  parser .As ide  from the  e legance  of the  t reatment ,  th i s  hasthe  advantage  that  "ungra - - -a t i ca l "  parenthet i ca lexpressions may undergo phrasal analysis and thusbecome single-phrase entities as far as theanalysis of the encompassing sentence isconcerned;  thus ,  ungr - - - -a t i ca l  parenthet i ca lexpress ions  need not  resu l t  in  ungrammat ica l(hence  poor ly  hand led)  sentences .IV CURRENT STATUSA.

It s tands  to reason  that ,  to get  themost t rus twor thy  f igures :  the  sys tem shou ld  beapp l ied  Co such var ie t ies  of  text  as ic i sin tended to hand le  ( in  the  near  term, at  leas t ) ;the  texts  shou ld  be chosen by the  user ,  and notd ivu lged  to the  vendor  be forehand except  perhapsin  the  form of a l i s t  of words or  techn ica l  terms(in root form) which appear therein -- and that.for not too ion S a period of time before the test.With the  reader  bear ing  a l l  of the  above inmind,  we repor t  the  fo l low ing  qua l i tymeasurements: during the last two years.
LRCpersonnel have measured the quality oftranslations produced by the L~C MT system interms of the percentage of sentences (actually.
"translation units', since isolated words andphrases appear frequently) which were translatedfrom German into acceptable English; if any changeto the translated unit was necessary, howeverslight, the translation was considered incorrect;the  test runs were made once or twice for eachtext -- once, before the text was ever seen by theLRC staff (a "blind" run), and once more, after afew months of system enhancement based in part onthe previous results (a "follow-up" run); theproject sponsor always provided the LRC with a171l i s t  of the words and techn ica l  terms sa id  to beemployed in  the text  ( the  l i s t  was sometimesincomplete ,  as one would expect  of humancompi la t ions  of the vocabu lary  in a la rgedocument) .
The f i r s t  run,  on a 50-page text ,  wasperformed only a f te r  the text  had been s tud ied  fo rsome t ime;  the second and th i rd  runs ,  on an80-page text ,  were performed both ways ( 'b l ind"and " fo l low-up ' ) ;  the four th  tes t  was a b l ind  runon a 200-page text .
The f igures  so measuredvar ied  from 55% to 85% depending on the text ,  andon whet~er the tes t  was a b l ind  or  fo l low-up  run .A f i f th  tes t  - -  a fo l low-up  run on the text  usedin  the four th  tes t  - -  has a l ready  been per formed,but the qua l i ta t ive  resu l t s  a re  not ava i lab le  atth i s  wr i t ing .
The resu l t s  of th i s  run and twomore b l ind  runs  on ~wo very  d i f fe rent  textsto ta l l ing  160 pages should be ava i lab le  when theconference  convenes;  these  qua l i ta t ive  resu l t s  a rea l l  to be measured by pro fess iona l  techn ica lt rans la tors  employed by the pro jec t  sponsor .D.
Interpretation of the ResultsAny pos i t ive  conc lus ions  we might  draw basedon such data  w i l l  be sub jec t  to cer ta inob jec t ions .
I t  has been argued that ,  un less  an MTsystem const i tu tes  an a lmost  per fec t  t rans la tor ,i t  w i l l  be use less  in  any pract i ca l  se t t ing  \[Kay,1980\].
As we in terpret  i t ,  the argument proceedssomething like this:(I) there are classical problems in CemputationalLinguistics that remain unsolved to this day(e.g., anaphora, quantifiers, conjunctions);(2) these problems will, in any practical setting,compound on one another so as to result in avery low probability that any given sentencewill be correctly translated;(3) it is not in principle possible for a systemsuffering from malady (1) above to reliablyidentify and mark its probable errors;(4) if the human post-editor has to check everysentence to determine if it has been correctlytranslated, then the translation is useless.We accept claims (i) and (3) without question.
Weconsider claim (2) to be a matter for empiricalvalidation -- surely not a very controversialcontention.
As it happens, the substantial bodyof empirical evidence gathered by the LRC to dateargues against this claim.
By the time theconference convenes, we will have more definitivedata to present ,  der ived  by the pro jec t  sponsor .Regarding (4 ) ,  we embrace the asaumpt ion thata human post -ed i to r  w i l l  have to check the ent i ret rans la t ion ,  sentence-by-sentence ;  but  we arguethat  Kay"s conc lus ion  ( " then  the t rans la t ion  i suse less" )  i s  again  proper ly  a mat ter  fo r  empi r i ca lva l idat ion .
Meanwhile, we are operat ing  under theassumpt ion  that  th i s  conc lus ion  i s  patent ly  fa l se-- after all, where translation is takenseriously, human translations are routinely editedvia exhaustive review, but no one claims that theyare use less lE.
Overa l l  PerformanceIn th i s  sect ion  we advance a mean ingfu l .more -or - less  ob jec t ive  metr i c  by which any MTsystem can and should  be judged:  overa l l(man/machine) t rans la t ion  per fo rmance .
The ideai s  s imp le .
The MT system must ach ieve  twos imul taneous  goa ls :  first, the sys tem's  outputmust be acceptab le  to the t rans la tor /ed i to r  fo rthe purpose of rev is ion ;  second,  the cost  of theto ta l  e f fo r t  ( inc lud ing  amort i za t ion  andmaintenance of the hardware and so f tware)  must beless  than the cur rent  a l te rnat ive  fo r  l i kematerial -- human translation followed bypost-editing.There may be a s ign i f i cant  problem wi th  there l iab i l i ty  of human rev isors"  judgements (whichare  never the less  the best  ava i lab le ) :  the wr i te rhas been to ld  by pro fess iona l  techn ica l  ed i to rs /t rans la tors  (potent ia l  users  of the LRC HT system)that  they look forward to ed i t ing  our machinet rans la t ions  "because the machine doesn ' t  care"\ [p r ivate  communicat ion\ ] .
(That i s ,  they wouldchange more in  a machine t rans la t ion  than in asupposed ly  equ iva lent  human t rans la t ion  becausethey would not  have to worry about insu l t ing  theor ig ina l  t rans la tor  w i th  what s /he  might  cons ider"petty" changes.)
Thus, the "correctness"s tandards  to be app l ied  to MT will very likelydiffer from those applied to human translation,simply due to the translation source.
Since theer rors  committed by an MT system seldom resembleer rors  made by human t rans la tors ,  the poss ib i l i tyof a "Tur ing  tes t "  fo r  an MT system does not  ex is ta t  the cur rent  t ime.When the conference convenes, we will presentsuch data as we have, bearing on the issue ofoverall performance using our system.
Preliminarydata from at least one outside assessment shouldbe available.
This information will tend coindicate the readiness of our system for use in aproduction translation enviroement.V DISCUSSIONWe have commented on the relative merits inlarge-scale application of several linguistictechn iques :  (a) a phrase-s t ructure  grammar; (b)syntact i c  features ;  (c) semant ic  features ;  (d)scored in terpretat ions ;  (e) t rans format ionsindexed to specific ~ules; (f) a transfercomponent; and (g) attached procedures to effecttranslation.
We also have presented our findingsconcerning the practical merits of severalcomputational techniques: (a) a bottom-up, all-paths parser; (b) associated rule-body procedures;(c) spelling correction; (d) chart searching incase of analysis failures; and (e) recursiveparsing of parenthetical expressions.
We believethese findings constitute useful information aboutthe state of the art in Computational Linguistics.172We wi l l  not have any f im empir ica l  evidenceconcerning overa l l  performance unt i l  l a te r  in1983, when the LEt )iT system wi l l  have been usedin-house by our sponsor,  for  very - la rge-sca letranslation experiments.
However, we will havesome pre l iminary  data from our sponsor source thatcan be adduced as a bas is  fo r  ext rapo la t ion .
(Oursponsor w i l l  indeed be using the data fo r  jus tsuch a purpose.)
