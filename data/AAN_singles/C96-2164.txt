A Method for Abstracting Newspaper Articles by Using Surface CluesHideo WatanabeIBM Research, Tokyo Research Laboratory1623-14, Shimotsuruma, Yamato-shi, Kanagawa-ken 242, JAPANwatanabe@trl.ibm.co.j pAbst ractThis paper describes a system which automaticallycreates an abstract of a newspaper article by selectingimportant sentences of a given text.
To determine theimportance of a sentence, several superficial featuresare considered, and weights for features are determinedby multiple-regression a alysis of a hand processed cor-pus.1 In t roduct ionThe rapid expansion of the Internet enables us toeasily access a lot of information sources in the world.The ability to browse information quickly is therefore avery important feature of an information retrieval andnavigation system.
Abstraction of a document is oneuseful tool for quick browsing of textual information.Generally, an abstract can be considered to be a con-cise text giving an outline of the original text.
Creat-ing an abstract requires deep semantic processing withbroad knowledge, and the strategy for generating anabstract depends on the type of target text.
Abstractscreated by humans tend to differ according to theircreators' background knowledge and interests.
Fur-thermore, as stated in \[6\], the same person is likelyto create different abstracts of the same text at dif-ferent times.
Simulating this human process is clearlyoutside the area that can be dealt with by current com-putational linguistics.
There are, however, some casesin which an abstract can be created by using surfaceclues to make conjectures as to which portions are themost important without using deep semantic process-ing.The most practical way to create an abstract is thusto determine the most important portions by using sur-face clues.
There are two lines of research based on thisapproach: one analyzes ome aspects of a text's struc-ture, such as the rhetorical structure \[7\], and selectssome sentences according to this structure \[5, 3\]; theother analyzes urface features for each sentence in agiven text and selects the most important sentencesaccording to some heuristics \[6, 1, 9\].
In methods offormer type, the rhetorical structure is appropriate fora relatively small set of sentences such as a paragraph,but it does not give enough information to create anabstract for a large set of sentences.
In methods of thelatter type, the validity of the heuristics is uncertainwhen the target text is changed.
Therefore, this paperproposes a method for selecting important sentences byusing an equation based on surface features and theirweights, and a method for determining these weightsby multiple-regression a alysis of abstracts created byhumans.
The target texts of this method are Japanesenewspaper articles.2 Sur face  Features  o f  a Sen-tenceThe proposed method is to create an abstract bydetermining important sentences according to featuresextracted from each sentence.
For each sentence ina given Japanese newspaper article, the following fea-tures 1 are analyzed:?
Important Keywords:An important keyword is defined as a keywordthat appears in another sentence or in a title.
Thenumber of points for this feature is tile total num-ber of occurrences of impot'tant keywords.?
Tense:The tense of a sentence is analyzed as past orpresent.
This feature gives 1 point for present,and 0 for past.l blest of these features were proposed in the previous tudies.Keywords were proposed in \[6\], sentence location was proposedin \[1\], sentence type was proposed in \[1, 9\], etc., and rhetori-ca\] relations were proposed in studies using rhetorical structuressud, as \[a\].974?
Type of a Sentence:Sentence types are fact, conjecture, or insistence.This feature gives 0 points for fact, 1 for conjec-ture, and 2 for insistence.?
Rhetorical Relation:The rhetorical relations to the preceding contextis analyzed as example, adverse, parallel, compar-ison, or connection.
This feature gives 1 point forreason, 2 for example, and 0 for others.?
Distance from the beginning of a text:In general, sentences located near the beginning ofa text tend to be important.
Therefore, sentencesin the first paragraph are given 5 points for thisfeature, sentences in the next paragraph 4, and soon.?
Distance from the end of a text:Sentences located near the ending of a text alsotend to be important.
Therefore, sentences in thelast paragraph are given 5 points for this feature,sentences in the previous paragraph 4, and so on.The tense of a sentence is simply determined to bepast if it has "ta" (an inflection for the past tense) inthe last phr~e3 The reason why tense is used is thatsentences tating about the current fact seem to bemore important han ones about the past fact in thecontext of editorial articles.The sentence type is determined by checking specialexpressions in the last phrase, a For instance, if the fi-nal phrase contains "bekida" ("should") or "nakereba-naranai" ("must"), then its sentence type is insistence;if it contains "darou" ("probably ..."), then its type isconjecture; otherwise, its type is fact.
Examples of spe-cial expressions used to determine sentence type are asfollows:?
Conjecture: kamosirenal (may), kanenai (be capa-ble of), souda (likely to), youda (likely to), darou(probably), etc.?
Insistence: tai (want to do), hosii (want someoneto do), bekida (should), nakereba-naranai (must),taisetu-dearu (important), hituyouda (necessary),etc.2 In this method,  past does not imply the past tense lit a str ictsense but rather ;the sentence is not in the present tense.
InJapanese, "ta" implies the past tense, completion, and so on.Most cases are actual instances of the past tense.nit is sufficient to check in fire last phrase for Japanese sen-tences, because a predicative phrase is always located at the endof a Japanese senteltce.
Therefore, another strategy is neededfor languages in which a predicative phrase may be located inthe middle of a sentence.The rhetorical relation is determined by checkingspecial expressions both in the first phrase and in thelast phrase of a sentence.
For instance, if "sitakarada" 4is found in the last phrase, then the rhetorical relationis reason, and if the conjunction "sikasi" ("but") isfound, then the rhetorical relation is adverse.
5 Exam-ples of special expressions used to determine rhetoricalrelations are listed below:?
Example: tatoeba (for instance), nado (etc.
), etc.?
Adverse: sikasi (but), tokoroga (however), etc.?
Comparison: koreni-taisi (while), etc.?
Parallel: mata (further), sarani (in addition), etc.?
Reason: karada (because), tameda (because), etc.3 Process  of Creat ing  an Ab-s t rac tThe basic method for creating an abstract in mostprevious tudies has been to analyze the sentences of atext in terms of some surface features, and a heuristicto determine the most important sentences on the basisof these features.The method proposed in this paper formalizes theabove approach so that the importance of each sentenceis calculated as the sum of feature points multiplied bytheir feature weights.
The most important sentencesare then extracted as an abstract.
The importance Sof a sentence is calculated as follows:r~i=twhere a is a constant, P/ is the number of points as-signed to the i-th feature, which is normalized to bebetween 0 and 1, and Wi is the weight assigned to thei-th feature.The steps in creating an abstract are as follows:1.
For each sentence, calculate the importance.2.
Select he sentence that has the highest impor-tance value among the unselected sentences.3.
If the selected sentence sl has another sentences2 in the previous context hat is related to st byany rhetorical structure, then s2 is also selectedand marked.41n English, this expression corresponds to "because" in thefirst phrase.5These checking of sentence types and rhetorical relations arebased on \[10\].9754.
If the ratio of the number of selected sentences tothe number of sentences in the text exceeds thespecified one, then terminate this process; other-wise, goto 2.These steps select sentences on the basis of theirimportance value, but they also respect the rhetori-cal structure to some extent (step 3), because if therhetorical structure is totally ignored, the output textwill be awkward to read.4 A Method  for Determin ingthe Weights of FeaturesMost previous systems can be considered to deter-mine the weights of features according to human intu-ition.
On the other hand, this paper proposes a methodfor determining the wieghts of features by multiple-regression analysis of correct examples, which are ab-stracts created by testers.
A tester selects importantsentences that should be included in an abstract.
Theimportance value of a sentence is defined as the numberof supporters (testers who selected it as an importantone) divided by the total number of testers.
Let thisimportance value be S; we then get the following equa-tion for each sentence:S=a+LWI*Piimlwhere, a is a constant, Pi is the number of points as-signed to the i-th featnre which is normalized to bebetween 0 to l, and Wi is the weight assigned to thei-th feature.In this equation, Wi is the only variable.
There-fore, the feature weight Wi is calculated by multiple-regression analysis.5 Exper imentWe conducted an experiment to check the validity ofthe proposed method.The testers were divided into two groups, A and B,each consisting 10 people.
Those in group A selectedimportant sentences (about 1/3 of the article) in 5 ed-itorials and 3 general articles from the Nikkei News-paper.
Those in group B selected important sentences(about 1/3 of the article) in 3 editorials and 3 generalarticles, which were different from those used for groupA.

In each of these figures, the first numberis a sentence number, the second number is the numberof supporters in group B, and the last part is a roughEnglish translation.
GTable 1 shows two weight sets; weight set 1 was cre-ated by the author in such a way that sentences locatednear the beginning and end are regarded as important,sentence importance is not proportional to points forrhetorical relation, and the importance of insistence-type sentences i higher in editorials than in generalarticles\] Weight set 2, on the other hand, was calcu-lated from the results obtained from group A by themethod described in the previous section.
Weight set2 for general articles implies that sentences near thebeginning are more important han ones near the end,and insistence-type sentences are less important, andso on.
On the other hand, weight set 2 for editori-als implies that sentences both near the beginning andnear the end are important, and that insistence-typesentences are important, sTo check the validity of these weight sets, we com-pared the abstracts created by the system, using weightset 1 and 2, from the articles supplied to group B, with6This translation was made by the author, and is not autho-rized by Nikkei Newspaper K.K.7This weight set 1 corresponds to the way used in previ-ous studies, where weights are determined according to humanintuition.8The weight set calculated in this method can be used as basicmateriM for creating a practical system, because it is difficult oask enough people to do this experiment to ensure that the resultis statistically meaningful.
However, the generM tendency canbe extracted, and the weight set is determined on the basis ofthis experiment.976the abstracts created by group B.
For the general arti-cle in Figure 1 (a), the three most important sentences(roughly 1/3 of the article) determined by using theweight sets 1 and 2 are listed in Figures 1 (b) and (c),respectively.
In this case, the three most importantsentences selected by grou t) B were 0, 2, and 3.
Like-wise, for the editorial in Figure 2 (a), the eight mostiml)ortant sentences (roughly 1/a of the article) deter-mined by using weight sets l attd 2 are listed in Figures2 (b) and (c), respectively, in this case, the eight mostimportant sentences selected by grou I) 11 are 0, 2, 3, 12,15, 20, 21, 22.
Here, we introduce the following metricof estrangement to check which abstract is most similarto the result of group B:Estrangement = ~., ,(the number of supporters of asentence si) - ~_~.</(the number of Sul)porters of asentence s j)where s{ is a sentence that is included in an abstract bygroup B but not in an abstract created by the system,and s./ is a sentence that is not included in an abstractby group B but is included in an abstract created bythe system.The estrangements of the articles in Figures 1 and 2are as follows: From this result, the weight set 2 calcu-1413Weight Set 1 Weight Set 2612to adjust these heuristics for the given text.
This pa-per proposed a method for this adjustment; that is,a method for determining weights of surface featuresby multiple-regression a alysis of abstracts created byhuman.
By using this method, a system can have anability to be applied to a variety of texts.7 Conc lus ionThis paper has proposed a method for creating anabstract by using surface features and their weightsto select important sentences, and a method for de-termining these \[eature weights by multiple-regressionanalysis of abstracts created by humans.
By using theproposed method to calculate feature weight, this sys-tem can be applied to other types of texts, and givesresults ntore similar to those of a human process thana set of weights based on human intuition.This abstract creation system is currently used in aninformatioll navigation assistance system \[8\] as a toolfor quickly viewing the contents of newspaper articles.References\[1\]\[2\]\[,3\]luted by multiple-regression a alysis is more similar tothe human selection than the weight set 1 created ac-cording to the author's intuition.
For the other general \[4\]articles used with group B, the estrangement values ofweight set 2 are also better than those of weight set \[q1.
In the other editorials, the estrangement values arccomparable.
This implies that the weight set I is notsuch a bad estimate for editorials.
