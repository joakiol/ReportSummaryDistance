Itenables us to select a concise set ofreading texts (from a target corpus) thatcontains all the target vocabulary to belearned.
We used a specialized vocab-ulary for an English certification test asthe target vocabulary and used EnglishWikipedia, a free-content encyclopedia, asthe target corpus.
The organized readingmaterials would enable learners not onlyto study the target vocabulary efficientlybut also to gain a variety of knowledgethrough reading.
The reading materialsare available on our web site.1 IntroductionEFL (English as a foreign language) learners andteachers can easily access a wide range of Englishreading materials on the Internet.
For example, cur-rent news stories can be read on web sites such asthose for CNN,1 TIME,2 or the BBC.3 Specializedreading materials for EFL learners are also providedon web sites like EFL Reading.4This situation, however, does not mean that EFLlearners and teachers can easily select proper textssuited to their specific purposes, for example, learn-ing vocabulary through reading.
On the contrary,1http://www.cnn.com/2http://www.time.com/time/3http://www.bbc.co.uk/4http://www.gradedreading.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/EFL teachers have to carefully select texts, if theywant their students to learn a specialized vocabularythrough reading in a particular discipline such asmedicine, engineering, or economics.
However, it isproblematic for teachers to select materials for learn-ing a target vocabulary with short authentic texts.It is possible to automate this selection processgiven the target vocabulary to be learned and the tar-get corpus from which texts are gathered (Utiyamaet al, 2004).
In this research (Utiyama et al, 2004),we used a specialized vocabulary for an Englishcertification test as the target vocabulary and usednewspaper articles from The Daily Yomiuri as thetarget corpus.
We then organized a set of readingmaterials, which we called courseware5, using thealgorithm in Section 2.
The courseware consistedof 116 articles and contained all the target vocabu-lary.
We used the courseware in university Englishclasses from May 2004 to January 2005.
We foundthat the courseware was effective in learning vocab-ulary (Tanimura and Utiyama, in preparation).Based on the promising results, our next goal isto distribute courseware (produced with our algo-rithm) to EFL teachers and learners so that we canreceive wider feedback.
To this end, the course-ware we constructed (Utiyama et al, 2004) is inade-quate because it was prepared from The Daily Yomi-uri, which is copyrighted.
We therefore replacedThe Daily Yomiuri with English Wikipedia,6 a free-content encyclopedia, and developed new course-5Courseware usually includes software in addition to othermaterials.
However, in this paper, the term courseware is usedto refer to the reading materials only.6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main Page117ware.
It is available on our web site.7In the following, will we first summarize our al-gorithm and then describe details on the coursewarewe constructed from English Wikipedia.2 AlgorithmWe want to prepare efficient courseware for learninga target vocabulary.
We defined efficiency in termsof the amount of reading materials that must be readto learn a required vocabulary.
That is, efficientcourseware is as short as possible, while containingthe required vocabulary.
We used a greedy methodto develop the efficient courseware (Utiyama et al,2004).Let C be the courseware under development andV be the target vocabulary to be learned.
We iter-atively select a document (from the target corpus)that has the largest number of new types8 (types con-tained in V but not in C) and put it into C until Ccovering all of V .
?C covers all of V ?
means thateach word in V occurs at least once in a documentin C.More concretely, let Vtodo be the part of V notcovered by C, and let Vdone be V ?Vtodo.
We iter-atively put document d into C that maximizes G(?
),G(d|?, Vtodo, Vdone)= ?g(d|Vtodo) + (1?
?
)g(d|Vdone), (1)until C covers all of V .
We then define g(?)
asg(d|Vx)= k1 + 1k1((1?
b) + b |W (d)|E(|W (?
)|) ) + 1|W (d) ?
Vx|, (2)where W (d) is the set of types in d, E(|W (?
)|) isthe average for |W (?
)| over the whole corpus, andk1 and b are parameters that depend on the corpus.We set k1 as 1.5 and b as 0.75. g(d|Vx) takes a largevalue when there is a large number of common typesbetween W (d) and Vx and d is short.
These effectsare due to |W (d)?Vx| and |W (d)|E(|W (?
)|) respectively.
Asg(?)
is based on the Okapi BM25 function (Robert-son and Walker, 2000), which has been shown to bequite efficient in information retrieval,9 we expected7http://www.kotonoba.net/?mutiyama/vocabridge/8A type refers to a unique word, while a token refers to eachoccurrence of a type.9BM25 and its variants have been proven to be quite effi-cient in information retrieval.
Readers are referred to papers bythe Text REtrieval Conference (TREC, http://trec.nist.gov/), forexample.g(?)
to be effective in retrieving documents relevantto the target vocabulary.In Eq.
(1), ?
is used to combine the scores ofdocument d, which are obtained by using Vtodo andVdone.
It is defined as?
= |Vdone|1 + |Vdone|(3)This implies that even if |W (d) ?
Vtodo| is 1, it isas important as |W (d) ?
Vdone| = |Vdone|.
Con-sequently, G(?)
uses documents that have new typesof the given vocabulary in preference to documentsthat have covered types.To summarize, efficient courseware is constructedby putting document d with maximum G(?)
into Cuntil C covers all of V .
This allows us to constructefficient courseware because G(?)
takes a large valuewhen a document has a large number of new typesand is short.3 ExperimentThis section describes how the courseware was con-structed by applying the method described in theprevious section.
We will first describe the vocab-ulary and corpus used to construct the coursewareand then present the statistics for the courseware.3.1 VocabularyWe used the specialized vocabulary used in theTest of English for International Communication(TOEIC) because it is one of the most popular En-glish certification tests in Japan.
The vocabulary wascompiled by Chujo (2003) and Chujo et al (2004),who confirmed that the vocabulary was useful inpreparing for the TOEIC test.
The vocabulary had640 entries and we used 638 words from it that oc-curred at least once in the corpus as the target vocab-ulary.3.2 CorpusWe used articles from English Wikipedia as the tar-get corpus, which is a free-content encyclopedia thatanyone can edit.
The version we used in this studyhad 478,611 articles.
From these, we first discardedstub and other non-normal articles.
We also dis-carded short articles of less than 150 words.
We thenselected 60,498 articles that were referred to (linked)by more than 15 articles.
This 15-link threshold was118set empirically to screen out noisy articles.
Finally,we extracted a 150-word excerpt from the lead partof each of these 60,498 articles to prepare the targetcorpus.
We set 150-word limit on an empirical basisto reduce the burden imposed on learners.
In short,the target corpus consisted of 60,498 excerpts fromthe English Wikipedia.
In the rest of the paper, wewill use the term an article to refer to an excerpt thatwas extracted according to this procedure.3.3 Example articleFigure 1 has an example of the articles in the course-ware.
It was the first article obtained with the al-gorithm.
It shares 27 types and 49 tokens with thetarget vocabulary.
These words are printed in bold.Corporate financeCorporate finance is the specific area of finance dealing with the fi-nancial decisions corporations make, and the tools and analysis usedto make the decisions.
The discipline as a whole may be divided betweenlong-term and short-term decisions and techniques.
Both share the samegoal of enhancing firm value by ensuring that return on capital exceedscost of capital.
Capital investment decisions comprise the long-termchoices about which projects receive investment, whether to finance thatinvestment with equity or debt, and when or whether to pay dividends toshareholders.
Short-term corporate finance decisions are called workingcapital management and deal with balance of current assets and cur-rent liabilities by managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowingand lending (e.g., the credit terms extended to customers).
Corporate fi-nance is closely related to managerial finance, which is slightly broader inscope, describing the financial techniques available to all forms of busi-ness ...

Eacharticle was 150 words long because only excerptswere used.
The average number of tokens per ar-ticle shared with the vocabulary (?num.
of com-mon tokens?
in the Table) was 18.4 and that oftypes (?num.
of common types?)
was 12.4.
About12.3%(= 18.4150 ?
100) of the tokens in each articlewere covered by the vocabulary.
Each article in the10On our web site, we prepared 10 sets of article sets calledcourse-1 to course-10.
These 10 courses were obtained by re-peatedly applying our algorithm to the English Wikipedia re-moving articles included in earlier courses.
The statistics pre-sented in this paper were calculated from the first courseware,course-1.courseware was referred to by 70.7 articles on av-erage as can be seen from the bottom row.
Table1 indicates that articles in the courseware includedmany target words and were heavily referred to byother articles.3.4.2 Distribution of covered typesFigure 2 plots the increase in the number of cov-ered types against the order (ranking) of articles thatwere put into the courseware.
The horizontal axisrepresents the ranking of articles.
The vertical axisindicates the number of covered types.
The increasewas sharpest when the ranking value was lowest (leftof figure).
The dotted horizontal lines indicate 50%and 90% of the target vocabulary.
These lines crossthe curved solid line at the 22nd and 83rd articles,i.e., 16.8% and 63.4% of the courseware, respec-tively.
This means that learners can learn most of thetarget vocabulary from the beginning of the course-ware.
This is desirable because learners sometimesdo not have enough time to read all the courseware.01002003004005006007000 20 40 60 80 100 120 140num.oftypes article ranking90%50%Figure 2: Increase in the number of covered types3.4.3 Document frequency distributionFigure 3 has target words that occurred in eight ar-ticles or more.
The numbers in parentheses indicatethe document frequencies (DFs) of the words, wherethe DF of a word is the number of articles in whichthe word occurred.
These words were the most ba-sic words in the target vocabulary with respect to thecourseware.Table 2 lists the distribution of DFs.
The firstcolumn lists the different DFs of the target words.The values in the ?#DF?

As wecan see from Table 2, more than 50% of the targetwords occurred in multiple articles.

We have pro-posed a method of automating this preparation pro-cess (Utiyama et al, 2004).
We have found that ourreading materials prepared from The Daily Yomiuriwere effective in vocabulary learning (Tanimura andUtiyama, in preparation).Our next goal is to distribute courseware (pro-duced with our algorithm) to EFL teachers andlearners so that we can receive wider feedback.
Tothis end, we replaced The Daily Yomiuri, whichis copyrighted, with the English Wikipedia, whichis a free-content encyclopedia, and developed newcourseware whose statistics were presented and dis-cussed in this paper.
This courseware, which isavailable on our web site, can be used to supplementclassroom learning activities as well as self-study.We hope it will help EFL learners to learn and teach-ers to teach a broader range of vocabulary.ReferencesK.
