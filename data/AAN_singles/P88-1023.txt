Ass ign ing  In tonat iona l  Features  in  Synthes ized  Spoken D i rec t ions  ?James Raymond DavisThe Media LaboratoryMIT E15-325Cambridge MA 02139Julia HirschbergAT&T Bell Laboratories2D-450600 Mountain AvenueMurray Hill N3 07974Abst rac tSpeakers convey much of the information hearers use tointerpret discourse by varying prosodic features uch asPHRASING, PITCH ACCENT placement, TUNE, and PITCHP.ANGE.
The ability to emulate such variation is crucialto effective (synthetic) speech generation.
While text-to-speech synthesis must rely primarily upon structural in-formation to determine appropriate intonational features,speech synthesized from an abstract representation f themessage to be conveyed may employ much richer sources.The implementation f an intonation assignment compo-nent for Direction Assistance, a program which generatesspoken directions, provides a first approximation of howrecent models of discourse structure can be used to controlintonational variation in ways that build upon recent re-search in intonational meaning.
The implementation fur-ther suggests ways in which these discourse models mighthe augmented to permit the assignment of appropriateintonational features.IntroductionDIRECTION ASSISTANCE !
was written to provide spo-ken directions for driving between any two points in theBoston areal7\] over the telephone.
Callers specify theirorigin and destination via touch-tone input.
The programfinds a route and synthesizes a spoken description of thatroute.
Earlier versions of Direction Assistance xhibitednotable deficiencies in prosody when a simple text-to-speech system was used to produce such descriptions\[6\],because prosody depends in part on discourse-level phe-nomena such as topic structure and information statuswhich are not generally inferrable from text, and thus*The inton~tion,d component described here was completed atAT&T Bell Laboratories in the summcT of 1987.
We th~nk JanetPie~Tehtunbert and Gregory Ward for valuable discussions.1 Direction Assistance was originally developed by Jim Davis andTom Trobaugh in 1985 at the Thinking Maf_~ines Corporation ofCambridge.cannot be correctly produced by the text to speech sys-tem.To alleviate some of these problems, we modified Direc-tion Assistance to make both attentional and intentionalinformation about the route description available for theassignment of intonational features.
With this informa-tion, we generate spoken directions using the Bell Labo~ratories Text-to-Speech System\[21\] in which pitch range,accent placement, phrasing, and tune can be varied tocommunicate attentional and intentional structure.
Theimplementation f this intonation assignment componentprovides a first approximation of how recent models ofdiscourse structure can be used to control intonationalvariation in ways that build upon recent research in into-national meaning.
Additionally, it suggests ways in whichthese discourse models must be enhanced in order to per-mlt the assignment of appropriate intonational features.In this paper, we first discuss some previous attemptsto synthesize speech from representations other than sim-ple text.
We next discuss the work on discourse structure,on English phonology, and on intonational meaning whichwe assume for this study.
We then give a brief overviewof Direction Assistance.
Next we describe how DirectionAssistance represents discourse structures and uses themto generate appropriate prosody.Previous StudiesOnly a few voice interactive systems have attempted toexploit intonation in the interaction.
The Telephone En-quiry Service (TES) \[19\] was designed as a frameworkfor applications uch as database inquiries, games, andcalculator functions.
Application programmers specifiedtext by phonetic symbols and intonation by a code whichextended Halliday's\[ll\] intonation scheme.
While TESgave programmers a high-level means of varying prosody,it made no attempt o derive prosody automatically froman abstract representation.187Young and Fallside's\[20\] Speech Synthesis from Con-cept (SSC) system first demonstrated the gains to be hadby providing more than simple text as input to a speechsynthesizer.
SSC passed a network representation f syn-tactic structure to the synthesizer.
Syntactic informationcould thus inform accenting and phrasing decisions.
How-ever, structural information alone is insufficient to deter-mine intonational features\[10\], and SSC does not use se-mantic or pragmatic/discourse information.Discourse and IntonationThe theoretical foundations of the current work are three:Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, Pierre-humbert's theory of English intonation, and Hirschbergand Pierrehumbert's studies of intonation and discourse.ing a discourse is reconstructing the DP, DSPs and rela-tions among them.Attentional structure in this model is an abstractionof 'focus of attention', in which the set of salient entitieschanges as the discourse unfolds.
2 A given discourse'sattentional structure is represented as a stack of FOCUSSPACES, which contain representations of entities refer-enced in a given DS, such as 'flywheel' or 'allen-headscrews', as well as the DS's DSP.
The accessibility of anentity m as, for pronominal reference m depends uponthe depth of its containing focus space.
Deeper spaces areless accessible.
Entities may be made inaccessible if theirfocus space is popped from the stack.I n tonat iona l  Features  and  the i r  In terpre -ta t ionMode l ing  D iscourse  S t ructureGrosz and Sidner\[9\] propose that discourse be understoodin terms of the purposes that underly it (INTENTIONALSTRUCTURE) and the entities and attributes which aresalient during it (ATTENTIONAL STRUCTURE).
Ill this ac-count, discourses are analyzed as hierarchies of segments,each of which has an underlying Discourse SegmentPurpose  (DSP) intended by the speaker.
All DSPs con-tribute to the overall D iscourse Purpose  (DP) of thediscourse.
For example, a discourse might have as itsDP something like 'intend that Hearer put together anair compressor', while individual segments might have ascontributing DSP's 'intend that Hearer remove the fly-wheel' or 'intend that Hearer attach the conduit o  themotor'.
Such DSP's may in turn be r.epresented as hier-archies of intentions, such as 'intend that a hearer loosenthe allen-head screws', and 'intend that Hearer locate thewheel-puller'.
DSPs a and b may be related to one an-other in two ways: a may DOMINATE b if the DSP ofa is partially fulfilled by the DSP of b (equivalently, bCONTRIBUTES TO a).
So, 'intend that Hearer removethe flywheel' dominates 'intend that Hearer loosen theallen-head screws', and the latter contributes to the for-mer.
Segment a SATISFACTION-PRECEDES b if the DSPof a must be achieved in order for the DSP of b to besuccessful. '
Intend that Hearer locate the wheel-puller'satisfaction-precedes 'intend that Hearer use the wheel-puller', and so on.
Such intentional structure has beenstudied most extensively in task-oriented domains, suchas instruction in assembling machinery, where speaker in-tentions appear to follow the structure of the task to someextent.
In Grosz and Sidner's model, part of understand-This model of discourse is employed for expositorypurposes by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert\[12\] in theirwork on the relationship between intonational and dis-course features.
In Pierrehumbert's theory of Englishphonolog~v\[16\], intonational contours are represented assequences of high (H) and low (L) tones (local max-ima and minima) in the FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (f0).Pitch accents fall on the stressed syllables of some lexicalitems, and may be simple H or L tones or complex tones.The four bitonal accents in English (H*-}-L, H-I-L*,L*-I-H, L-I-H*) differ in the order of tones and in whichtone is aligned with the stressed syllable of the accentedi tem- -  the asterisk indicates alignment with stress.
Pitchaccents mark items as intonationally prominent and con-vey the relative 'newness' or 'salience' of items in the dis-course.
For example, in (la), right is accented (as 'new'),while in (lb) it is deaccented (as 'old').
(I) a.
Take a right, onto Concord Avenue.b.
Take another right, onto Magazine Street.Different pitch accents convey different meanings: For ex-ample, a L-t-H* on right in (la) may convey 'contrastive-ness', as after the query So, you take a left ontoConcord?.A simple H* is more likely when the direction of the turnhas not been questioned.
A L*~H,  however, can conveyincredulity or uncertainty about the direction.INTERMEDIATE PHRASES are composed of one or morepitch accents, plus an additional PHRASE ACCENT (H orL), which controls the pitch from the last pitch accent to~See \[1\] and \[3\] for earlier AI work on global and local focus.188the end of the phrase.
INTONATIONAL PHRASES consistof one or more intermediate phrases, plus a BOUNDARYTONE, also H or L, which falls at the edge of the phrase;we indicate boundary tones with an '%',  as H%.
Phraseboundaries are marked by lengthened final syllables and(perhaps) a pause - -  as well as by tones.
Variations inphrasing may convey structural relationships among el-ements of a phrase.
For example, (2) uttered as twophrases favors a non-restrictive r ading in which the firstright happens to be onto Central Park.
(2) Take the first right \[,\] onto Central Park.Uttered as a single phrase, (2) favors the restrictive read-ing, instructing the driver to find the first right whichgoes onto Central Park.TUNES, or intonational contours, have as their domainthe intonational phrase.
While the meaning of tunes ap-pears to be compositional w from the meanings of theirpitch accents, phrase accents, and boundary tones\[15\],certain broad generalizations may be made about par-ticular tunes in English.
Phrases ending in L H% ap-pear to convey some sense that the phrase is to be com-pleted by another phrase.
Phrases ending in L L% ap-pear more 'declarative' than 'interrogative' phrases end-ing in H H%.
Phrases composed of sequences of H*-I-Laccents are often used didactically.The PITCH RANGE of a phrase is (roughly) the distancebetween the maximum f0 value in the phrase (modulosegmental effects and FINAL LOWERING effects) and thespeaker's BASELINE, defined for each speaker as the low-est point reached in normal speech over all utterances.Variation in pitch range can communicate he topic struc-ture of a discourse\[12, 18\]; increasing the pitch range of aphrase over prior phrases can convey the introduction ofa new topic, and decreasing the pitch range over a priorphrase can convey the continuation of a subtopic.
Afterany bitonal pitch accent pitch range is compressed.
Thiscompression, called catathesls ,  or downstep,  extends tothe nearest phrase boundary.
Another process, called FI-NAL LOWEP~NG, involves a compression of the pitch rangeduring the last half second or so of a 'declarative' utter-ances.
The amount of final lowering present for utteranceappears to correlate with the amount of 'finality' to beconveyed by the utterance.
That is, utterances that endtopics appear to exhibit more final lowering, while utter-ances within a topic segment may have little or none.In tonat ion  in D i rec t ion -G iv ingTo identify potential genre-specific ntonational charac-teristics of direction-giving, we performed informal pro-duction studies, with speakers reading sample texts ofdirections similar to those generated by Direction As-sistance.
From acoustic analysis of this data, we notedfirst that speakers tended to use H*+L accents quitefrequently, in utterances like that whose pitch track ap-pears in Figure 1.
The use of such contours has beenassociated in the literature with 'didactic' or 'pedantic'contexts.
Hence, the propensity for using this contour ingiving directions eems not inappropriate to emulate.We also noted tendencies for subjects to vary pitchrange in ways similar to proposals mentioned abovethat is, to indicate large topic shifts by increasing pitchrange and to use smaller pitch ranges where utterancesappeared to 'continue' a previous topic.
And we notedvariation in pausal duration which was consistent withthe notion that speakers produce longer pauses at majortopic boundaries than before an utterance that contin-ues a topic.
However, these informal studies were simplyintended to produce guidelines.In the intonation assignment component we added toDirection Assistance, pitch accent placement, phrasing,tune, and pitch range and final lowering are varied asnoted above to convey information status, structuralinformation, relationships among utterances, and topicstructure.
We will now describe how Direction Assistanceworks in general, and, in particular, how it uses this com-ponent in generating spoken directions.Direction AssistanceDirection Assistance has four major components.
TheLocat ion F inder  queries the user to obtain the originand destination of the route.
The Route  F inder  thenfinds a 'best' route, in terms of drivability and describabil-ity.
Once a route is determined, the Descr iber  generatesa text describing the route, which the Nar ra tor  reads tothe user.
In the work reported here, we modified theDescriber to generate an abstract representation of theroute description and replaced the Narrator with a newcomponent, he Talker, which computes prosodic valuesfrom these structures and passes text augmented withcommands controlling prosodic variation to the speechsynthesizer.189lO01501|$1007 5=.

L,Figure 1: Pitch Track of Subject Reading DirectionsGenerat ing  text  and  d iscourse  s t ruc turesThe Describer's representation f a route is called a tour .A tour is a sequence of acts  to be taken in following theroute.
Acts represent something the driver must do infollowing the route.
Act types include s tar t  and stop,  forthe beginning and ending of the tour, and various kindsof turns.
A rich classification of turns is required in orderto generate natural text.
A 'fork' should be describeddifferently from a 'T '  and from a highway exit.
Turningacts include enter  and exit  from a limited access road,merge,  fork, u - turn ,  and ro tary .For each act type, there is a corresponding descriptiveschema to produce text describing that act.
Text gen-eration also involves selecting an appropriate cue for theact.
There are four types of cues: Action cues signalwhen to perform an act, such as "When you reach theend of the road, do x ' .
Confirmatory cues are indica-tors that one is successfully following the route, such as"You'll cross x" or "You'll see y ' .
Warning cues cautionthe driver about possible mistakes.
Failure cues to de-scribe the consequences of mistakes (e.g.
"If you see x,you have gone too far ' )  have not yet been implemented.In general, there will be several different items potentiallyuseful as action or confirmatory cues.
The Describer se-lects the one which is most easily recognized (e.g.
a bridgecrossing) sad which is close to the act for which it is acue .Descriptive schemas are internally organized into syn-tactic constituents.
Some constituents are constant, andothers, e.g.
street names and direction of turns, axe slotsto be filled by the Describer from the tour.
Constituentsaxe further grouped into one or more (potential) intona-tional phrases.
Each phrase will have a pitch range, a pre-ceding pause duration, a phrase accent, and a boundarytone assigned by the Talker.
Phrases that end utteranceswill also have a final lowering percentage.
Where schemasinclude more than one intonational phrase, relationshipsamong these phrases are documented in the schema tem-plate so that they may be preserved when intonationalfeatures are assigned.Intentional structure is also represented at the level ofthe intonational phrase.
Unlike in Grosz and Sidner'smodel, a single phrase may represent a discourse seg-ment.
This departure stems from our belief that, follow-ing \[12, 15\], certain intonational contours can communi-cate relationships among DSP's.
3 Certain relationships3It is possible that  the intermedla~e phrase my prove an evenbetty" u~t  for discourse segmentation.190among DSP's are specified within schemas; others are de-termined from the general task structure indicated by thedomain and the particular task structure indicated by thecurrent path.Constituents may be annotated with semantic infor-mation to be used in determining information status.
Se-mantic annotations include the type of the object anda pointer (to the internal representation for the objectdesignated).
For each type of object, there is a predicatewhich can test two objects of that type for co-designation.For example, for purposes of reference or accenting wemay want to treat 'street' and 'avenue' as similar.Each DS has associated with it a focus space.
Following\[2\], a focus space consists of a set of FORWARD-LOOKINGCENTERS, potentially salient discourse ntities and mod-ifiers.
Focus spaces are pushed and popped from the FO-CUS STACK as the description is generated, according tothe relationships among their associated DS's.As an example, the generator for the rotary act ap-pears in figure 2.
This schema generates two sentences,second of which is a conjunction.
One slot in thisschema is taken by an NP constituent for the rotary.The make-np-const i tuent  routine handles agreementbetween the article and the noun.
A second slot is filledwith an expression giving the approximate angular dis-tance traveled around the rotary.
The actual value de-pends upon the specifics of the act.
A third slot in thisschema is filled by the name of the street reached aftertaking the rotary.
The choice of referring expression forthe street name depends upon the type of street.
Nocues are generated here, on the grounds that a rotary isunmistakable.Assigning Intonational FeaturesThe TAlicer employes variation in pitch range, pausal du-ration, and final lowering ratio to reflect he topic struc-ture of the description, or, the relationship among DS's asreflected in the relationship among DSP's.
Following theproposals of \[12\], we implement this variation by assignedeach DS an embeddedness level, which is just the depthof the DS within the discourse tree.
Pitch range decreaseswith embeddedness.
In Grosz and Sidner's terms, for ex-ample, for DS1 and DS2, with DSPz dominating DSP2,we assign DS1 a larger pitch range than DS2.
Similarly, ifDSP2 dominates DSP3, DSs will have a still smaller pitchrange than DS2.
Sibling DS's will thus share a commonpitch range.
Pitch variation is perceived logarithmically,so pitch range decreases as a constant fraction (.9) at each(defun d isc -seg- ro tary  (act)( l i s t(make-sentence"You ' l l "  "come" " to"(make-np-constil;uenl; ' ( " ro tary" ):article :indefinite))(make-conjunction-sentence(make-sentence"Go" (rotary-angle-amount(get - in fo  act  ' ro tary -ang le ) )"eay .

Also following \[12\], we vary final lowering toindicate the level of embeddedness of the segment com-pleted by the current utterance.
We largely suspend finallowering for the current utterance when it is followed byan utterance with greater embedding, to produce a senseof topic continuity.
Where the subsequent u terance has alesser degree of embedding than the current utterance, weincrease final lowering proportionally.
So, for example, ifthe current utterance were followed by an utterance withembedding level 0 (i.e., no embedding, indicating amajortopic shift), we would give the current utterance maxi-mal final lowering (here, .87).
Pansal duration is greatest(here, 800 msec) between segments at the least embeddedlevel, and decreases by 200 msec for each level of embed-ding, to a minimum of 100 msec between phrases.
Ofcourse, the actual values assigned in the current applica-tion are somewhat arbitrary.
In assigning final lowering,as pitch range and intervening pausal duration, it is therelative differences that are important.Accent placement is determined according to relativesalience and 'newness' of the mentioned item.\[12, 14, 5\](We employ Prince's\[17\] Givens, or given-salient notionhere to distinguish 'given' from 'new' information.
How-ever, it would be possible to extend this to include hi-erarchically related items evoked in a discourse as alsogiven, or 'Chafe-given'\[17\], were such possibilities presentin our domain.)
Certain object types and modifier typesin the domain have been declared to be potentially salient.When such an item is to be mentioned in the path descrip-tion, it is first sought in the current focus space and itsancestors.
In general, if it is found, it is deaccented; oth-erwise it receives a pitch accent.
If the object is not a191potentially salient type, then, if it is a function word, itis deaccented, otherwise it is taken to be a miscellaneouscontent word and receives an accent by default.
In somecases, we found that -- contra current theories of focus-- items should remain deaccentable even when the focusspaces containing them have been popped from the focusstack.
In particular, items in the current focus space'spreceding sibling appear to retain their 'givenness'.
Re-analysis to place both occurrences in the same segmentor to ensure that the first is in a parent segment seemedto lack independent justification.
So, we decided to allowitems to remain 'given' across sibling segment boundaries,and extended our deaccenting possibilities accordingly.We vary phrasing primarily to convey structural infor-mation.
Structural distinctions uch as those presentedby example (2) are accomplished in this way.Intentional structure is conveyed by varying intona-tional contour as well as pitch range, final lowering, andpausal duration.
A phrase which required 'completion' byanother phrase is assigned a low phrase accent and a highboundary tone (this combination is commonly known asCONTINUATION RISE).\[15\] For example, since we gener-ate VP conjunctions primarily to indicate temporal orcausal relationship (e.g Stay on Main Street for aboutninety yards, and cross the Longfellow Bridge.
), we usecontinuation rise in such cases on the first phrase.The sample text in Figure 3 ia generated by the sys-tem.
Note that commands to the speech synthesizer havebeen simplified for readability as follows: 'T '  indicatesthe topline of the current intonational phrase; 'F '  indi-cates the amount of final lowering; 'D '  corresponds to theduration of pause between phrases; 'N* '  indicates a pitchaccent of type N; other words are not accented.
Phraseaccents are represented by simple H or L, and boundarytones are indicated by %.
The topic structure of the textis indicated by indentation.Note that pitch range, final lowering, and pauses be-tween phrases are manipulated to enforce the desiredtopic structure of the text.
Pitch range is decreased to re-fleet the beginning of a subtopic; phrases that continue atopic retain the pitch range of the preceding phrase.
Finallowering is increased to mark the end of topics; for exam-ple, the large amount of final lowering produced on thelast phrase conveys the end of the discourse, while lesseramounts of lowering within the text enhance the sense ofconnection between its parts.
Pauses between clauses arealso manipulated so that lesser pauses separate clauseswhich are to be interpreted as more closely related to oneanother.

Wehave tested these ideas by modifying the text genera-tion component of Direction Assistance to produce an ab-stract representation f the information to be conveyed.This 'message-to-speech' approach to speech synthesishas clear advantages over simple text-to-speech synthe-sis, since the generator 'knows' the meanings to be con-veyed.
This application, while over-simplifying the rela-tionship between discourse information and intonationalfeatures to some extent, nonetheless demonstrates that itshould be possible to assign more appropriate prosodic192features automatically from an abstract representation fthe meaning of a text.
Further research in intonationalmeaning and in the relationship of that meaning to as-pects of discourse structure should facilitate progress to-ward this goal.References\[1\] Barbara Grosz.
