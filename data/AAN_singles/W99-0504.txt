With regard to the representation ofinformation, NLP oriented formalisms usuallyInclude reformation about the subcategonzatmnreqmred by the verb It can be shown bydeclaring the list of structures m which the verbparticipates (Sager 1981), or these structures canalso be generated from one frame as is the caseof the LFG (Kaplan & Bresnan 1982), GPSG(Gazdar et al1985), and HPSG (Pollard & Sag1987)We propose that given a type hierarchy ofverb entries, the rules that account for syntacticbehavior regarding alternations have to beassociated to the representative type of a verbgroup m order to express interesting hngmst~cgenerahzatlons In these types, the participationof a set of verbs m a particular alternation andthe mechanism required to express ~t must bespemhed Works carried out along these linesare those of Sanfillppo (1990) and Taul6 (1995)w~thm the Acqmlex project2 Model of lexicai entryOur initial hypothesis ~s that the syntax andthe semantics of lexlcal ~tems are Interrelated(Levm & Pinker 1991, Levm 1993, Levm &Rappaport 1995) These authors consider that2:3verbs can be semantically classified based on themeaning they share The hypothesis is that theverbs of a semant\[c class will share the samesyntactic behavior Hence, each semantic lass isassocmted w~th the constructions m which theverbs of that group participateIn our approach, we consider that relevantsemantic information can be deduced from thesyntactic behavior Thus, our semantic analysisincludes a syntactic study of thesubcategonzation frames m which differentverbs can be found For this reason, m contrastto the above mentioned authors, we do not Infersyntactic behavior from the semanticcharacterization but rather it is syntax that helpsus to complete this semantic description Wealso conslder that this relation can beformahzed, and that it is essential for thecharactenzatlon f the entriesThe three elements around which theinformation that makes up the verbal lex~calentry is organized are meaning components,event structure and diathesis alternations W~thregard to meanmg components, we drawprincipally from Talmy (1985) Accordmg tothis author, these components play a central rolein defining verbal semantic lassesIn our approach we have defined a smallgroup of semantic components that we haveorganized into several levels The levels rangefrom the mole general to the more specific Thehrst level is common to all the predicates andaccounts for Entity The second level serves usto distinguish events from states 0nly the firstones can have an Imttator At a third level wespecify those components relevant for groupingverbs into semantic classes Change, Attitude,Tranaference, tc The components considered ata more specific level allow us to characterizepledicates, but not to define new classeshzstrument, etc From the standpoint ofleahzatlon, they can be expressed ,,a the le-_calitem' (e g La pared se desplom6 / The wallcrashed) or else syntagmattcally (eg Elplfnclpe se transform6 en rana / The princeturned mto a frog)As concerns event structure, we followParsons' (1990) and Pustelovsky's (1995)\] By IlledOS o f  \[e'~tcdhz,ltlol't Int.orporatloN or  e\[qe It t.:ln beundel stoodworks These authors consider that an event canbe decomposed into a subatomic structure mwhxch the temporal relatJons establishedbetween the subevents and the partlclpants aredescnbed In this sense, several patterns ofeventual behavior have been established Theymteract with the other elements that constituteour modelFinally, our model ptesents mfotmat~onabout diathesis alternations This is the ~ublectof this paper and acts as the basis for the vetbclasslficat~on we present here We haveformalized this reformation in the PlrdptdesLextcal Knowledge Base (PLKB) m the form otmodules In It, the types corresponding to eachone of the modules that form the entry have beenmade explicit Also, the dmthesls alternationshave been dealt with as lex~cal rules An extramodule, FORLOG, has been defined to accountfor the relation between semantics and syntax,connecting all the mformatton to be found3 Concept of Diathesis AlternationsOur starting point for the study ofalternations i Levm's (1993) work Unlike thisauthor, we think that it Is important to take mtoaccount only those very general alternations(middle, causative-mchoatlve ), that explainrelevant syntactic behavior and that leallyhighlight the relation between syntax andsemantxcs Those constructxons that are veryspecific and m which veiy few velbs pattlclpate,such as Obhgarotw Adverb (8 5), have been leftasideIn our proposal we understand tatheses asone of the syntagmatlc expressions of a semanticopposmon Dlathesis alternations are thus pairsof structures (or diatheses) related to each otherby one of these oppositionsWith this concept m mind we haveconsidered the existence of three possibleoppositions depending on whether there is achange of focus m the participants (Change offocus and Underspecificatlon) or there Is achange m the event structure (AspectualOpposition) For example, the sentences(1) a Elena cerr6 la puerta (Elena closed the dool )b La puerta se cerr6 (The door closed)are related by a change of focus oppositionwhereas in (a) the cause that provokes the event23is expressed, m (b) the change undertaken by theentity is focahzed On the other hand, sentencessuch as(2) a Juan coml6 pescado (Juan ate fish)b Juan coral6 (Juan ate)are related by means of an underspeclficat~onopposition of (b) with respect o (a) Lastly, theaspectual opposmon ~s illustrated in thefollowing examples in which an event (a) isrelated w~th a state (b)(3) a Sara pinta un retrato (S as painting a portraat)b Sara pinta muy bten (Sara paints very well)We start from the hypothes~s that theseoppositions are general and mterhngulstlc innature and that, therefore, the correspondingsyntagmatlc realizations m each language haveto be defined It ~s thus possible to estabhshtranslation relations between the languages at asemantic level and for each meaning opposmonit wdl thereby be feasible to predict he syntacticstructures that can express it (Fermindez andMartf 98)For example, Basque incorporates the causeby means of a morphological process as can beseen m the examples below(4) a Kanpalak.lo du (The bell rang)b Apalzak kanpalarl joarazl &o (The priesttang the bell)Whereas in other languages, such asSpamsh and Catalan, we need a causativeauxdmry verb to express the same mformat~on(5) a La campana son6 (Sp) /La campana va sonar (Cat)b El cura htzo sonar la campana (Sp) /El capellh vafet sonar la campana (Cat)Conversely, m Enghsh nelther themorphological process nor the auxiliary verb aleneededDmthes\]s alternations m our approach canbe expressed m three ways in the same lex~calatem (cut, break), by means of morphologicalprocesses (aburru/aburttr~e) Ol by composition(bore/get bored) In the following section, wepresent our typology of opposmons m greaterdetad They are grouped mto two classes In thefirst one, subsectlon 4 1, the opposition ~sbetween two event~ve structures whde m thesecond, subsection 42,  the opposition isbetween an event and a state4 Typology of Diathesis Alternations4.1 Opposition event-eventIn this opposition, there ~s an alternationbetween two eventlve constructions We havedefined two main types change of focus andunderspeclficatlon In the former, we includethose alternations m which a ddfetentparticipant becomes the topic of the sentence,thus occupying the subject position In the latter,we group those constructaons an which anelement ~s omitted but the topic of the sentenceremains the same4 1.1 Change of focusThis opposmon lmphes a change ofperspective m the subcategonzed lements -' Thefirst subtype (a) is an alternation between theexpression or the non-expression of the causeThe second (b) is an opposmon m which there Isan interchange of arguments at a syntactic levelwithout any loss of semantic reformationFinally, in the third subgroup (c) there is achange in the focalization of the components ofa single argument which is semanticallycomplexa) Cause one of the alternating structures ~scausative, \ [e  the cause ~s expressed m theconstituent that occupies the subject posmon Inthe other structure, the ant~causat~ve, thechangeundertaken by the entity ~s focahzed and ztmoves to the subject position, the cause ~usually left unexpressed In th~s type ofopposmon, a s~mdar change occurs m thefocahzat~on of the event head m the causatwestructure the process ~s focahzed and ~n theant~causatwe it ~s the resulting

we referto an opposition between a structure thatpresents an entity as a whole and anotherconstruction in which th e emphasis Is placed onone of its consututwe parts We understand thistype of metonymlcal relauon In a broad sense,including as parts the instruments, the means,the properties, the contents, etcIn this case, the possible combinations ofthe syntactic alternatmns ~s considerable Theswitch can be within the verb phrase or withinthe subject and complement positions Theremight be either a loss of mformauon or only achange in the dlstrlbutlon of the participantsNext we observe

examples (6) thele isno switch and we are predicating about aproperty of the first argument(6) a Maria danced the tango (event)b Marfa dances the tango (very well) (state)It seems-that  all the events can betransformed into a state when the conditionspreviously mentioned are fulfilledThe constluction known as middle isincluded in this group too Th~s structure Ispamc~pated by those tiansmve predicates that25allow argument sw~tch and that reqmre anadverbial modifier to express the manner mwhich a property of the enmy IS being affected(7) a My mother cut the meat (event)b This meat cuts easdy (state)Lastly, the construction known as adjecttvalpassive estar+partlc~ple combines with atransitive construction to express the same sortof opposition(8) a El ratio ha roto el juguete / The child hasbroken the toy (event)b El juguete est~i roto / The toy is broken(state)In short, our proposal for dlatheslsalternations is based on estabhshmggenerahzat~ons that allow us to characterizegroups of syntactic onstructions that providesemantic riteria for verb analysis We havepresented m this section three semanticalternations that we have considered so farchange of focus (cause, mverse and hohstlc),underspecificat~on a d aspectual oppositionThis proposal has allowed us to classify verbsinto semantic lasses according to the semanticopposition m which they pamclpate Also, theycan be further subclasslfied according to criteriaregarding event structure and subcategorlzatlonIn the next section we present the result of suchgrouping5 Resulting classesWe have grouped about 4 000 velbs (1 350in each language approximately) 4 This groupinghas been made according to the sharedcharacteristics which define the behavior of thepredicates The classes defined so far arePredicates of Change (800 predicates),Predicates o f  Attitude (200 predicates) andPredicates of Transference (350 predicates) Notall the verbs behave homogenously within eachgroup This Is the reason why we have furthersubdivided them according to protobehavlors(see appendix)Thin approach shows a more general andconsistent classification More general because4 We have available an LDB containing the translationequivalences m Catalan Spanish and Engh,,h for all these veibshnkmg them to Levm s semantic lasses and to the new classes wepropose in this paperwe have grouped 1 350 verbs belonging to 20Levm classes into just three classes, moreconsistent m the sense that we have apphed the.same criteria in defining all of them As can beseen in table 1 (see Appendix), classes hare thesame meaning components, two of which, thelmtlator and the entity, are also shared by themembers of the three groups since all of themdenote an event Furthermore, ach class canpresent he same event structure and the samebasic dmthesas altemauons a wellAs we have mentioned, these groups aresubdwlded according to more specific syntacticand/or semantic criteria In the tables mAppendix we prowde for each class thedistractive features, the subclasses with theirdefining elements, and the actual predicates todlustrate themIn the case of the verbs of change, two basictypes are observed (change 1 and change 2)depending on whether the expression ot thecomponent change ts made lexlcally or it ~sexpressed as a different constituent (see table 2)In the case of verbs that express an atmudeor feeling (see table 3), two groups are alsoobserved (amtudel-2 and attitude 3) if we takeinto account he subcategorlzatlon and the kindof reahzatlon of the meanmg component specificto the class If we consider event structure thefirst group sphts into two (attitude 1and attitude2)The type of event expressed by the verbsthat we ale dealing with can also be simple orcomplex The verbs of atmude that have acomplex event structure xpress two processesWe thus differentiate between verbs that expressa simple mental process (de~ear-dea,re) florathose that also denote another action (complexevents) Thls other action can be of acommumcatwe type (c~tttcar-crtttctze) or of adifferent kind (reir de-laugh at)Finally, when dealing with vetbs oftransference we find that their subcategonzat~onpresents a wide range of poss~bdltltes Itdepends on whether the verb can expresssyntactically the points of the trajectory (tr detin sttto a otro-go from one place to another) oronly one of them (ponet una cosa en un ~ttto*(deade otro) - put somethmg m a place (floraanother)), or ~f it can express a transferencecarried out autonomously b  the entity (correr-26run) or it cannot (dar-gtve) The combmanon ofthese factors g~ve rise to four subgroups that westate m table 46 Implementat ionThe generalizations obtained at a theoretlcallevel, both for the classes as well as for thesubgroups defined according to the observedbehavmrs, have been reflected m an LKB Tothat end, we have designed a type h~erarchy totake into account he umverse that we want todescribeEach verb is ascribed to a type that containsmformatmn shared by the group This allows thetask of entering data to be economized w~thoutany loss of mformanon and takes into accountthe characteristics shared by sets of verbsThe hierarchy contains two basic typesuttles and entry Uttles ubsumes all the objectsthat are used for the descnptlon of the basicelements m the entry meaning components,dmthesxs alternatmns, and event structure Ineach case, the basic elements are declared thethree types of dmthests altematmns, the hst ofcomponents and the types of events (thetemporal relation estabhshed between them andthe head)Entry includes two subtypes to account forthe simple and complex structures declared and,for each case, subtypes are defined for the verbalclasses (entry-type-change 1, entry-type-change2 ) In these types, the syntact~c-semantic mformauon shared is declared Thus,for instance, the veib sorprender (to surprise)that belongs to the class of verbs of change 1 isassigned the type entry-t3,pe-changelsorprenderentry-type-change 1<morf>="sorprend-/M3"<syntax subcat compl semref>=all<syntax subcat restcomp compl semref>=ammFtgure 1As can be seen in figure 1, at the lexlcallevel only idiosyncratic mformatmn is specified,l e morphology and selectlonal restrictions,whereas the data about meaning components,event structure and alternations ~s obtainedthrough mechanisms of inheritance from theassigned typeIn the specification of the alternations (seefigure 2), an attribute is included for each one(DIATVAL) It serves to indicate whether theverb pamc~pates in the constructmn a d when ~tdoes it expresses the procedure reqmred by theverb to convey the meaning (lex~cal, syntacuc ormorphological) From this reformation a lexlcalrule can be apphed and a new entry

Enghsh Showdifferent mechamsms for the expression of themeaning conveyed by the alternationsThe study of alternations, together w~th themeaning components and event structure, haspermitted us to group
