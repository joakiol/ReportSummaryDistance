This situ-ation has important negative consequences for naturallanguage processing (NLP): since the spoken dialectsare not officially written and do not have standardorthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate cor-pora to use for training NLP tools.
Furthermore, thereare almost no parallel corpora involving TD andMSA.
In this paper, we describe the creation of Tuni-sian dialect text corpus as well as a method for build-ing a bilingual dictionary, in order to create languagemodel for speech recognition system for the TunisianBroadcast News.
So, we use explicit knowledge aboutthe relation between TD and MSA.1 IntroductionRecently, due to the political changes thathave occurred in the Arab world, we noticed anew remarkable diversity in the media.
Arabicdialects used in daily life have became progres-sively used and represented in interviews, newsand debate programs instead of Modern StandardArabic (MSA).
In Tunisia for example, the revo-lution has affected not only the people but alsothe media.
Since that, the media programs havebeen changed:  television channels, political de-bates and broadcasts news have been multiplied.Therefore, this gave birth to a new kind of lan-guage.
Indeed, the majority of speech is no long-er on MSA but alternating between MSA anddialect.
Thus, we can distinguish in the samespeech, MSA words, TD words and MSA-TDwords such as a word with an MSA component(stem) and dialectal affixes.
This situation posessignificant challenges to NLP, in fact applyingNLP tools designed for MSA directly to TDyields significantly lower performance, making itimperative to direct the research to building re-sources and tools to process this kind of lan-guage.
In our case we aim to convert this newlanguage to text, but this process presents a se-ries of linguistic and computational challengessome of these relate to language modeling: stud-ying large amounts of text to learn about patternsof words in a language.
This task is complicatedbecause of the total lack of TD-MSA resources,whether parallel text or paper dictionaries.
In thispaper, we describe a method to create TunisianDialect (TD) text corpora and the associated lex-ical resources as well as building bilingual dic-tionary MSA-TD.2 Related workSpoken languages which have no written formcan be classified as limited-resources languages.Therefore, several studies has attempted to over-come the problems of computerization of theselanguages.
(Scherrer, 2008) in order to computer-ize the existing dialect in Switzerland, developeda translation system: standard German to anyvariety of the dialect continuum of German-speaking Switzerland.
Moreover, (Shaalan et al2007) proposed a system of translation MSA-Egyptian dialect.
For this, they tried to build aparallel corpus between Egyptian dialect andMSA-based on mapping rules EGY-MSA.
Be-sides dialects, there are several languages fromthe group of limited-resources languages that donot have a relation with a well-resourced lan-guage.
Indeed, (Nimaan et al 2006) presentedseveral scenarios to collect corpora in order to88process the Somali language: Collecting corpusfrom the web, automatic synthesis of texts andmachine translation French-Somali.
(SENG,2010) selected news sites in Khmer to collectdata in order to solicit the lack of resources inKhmer.The literature shows that there is little work thatdealt with the Tunisian Arabic, the target lan-guage of this work.
(Graja et al2011), for ex-ample, treated the Tunisian Dialect for under-standing speech.
To train their system, research-ers relied on manual transcripts of conversationsbetween agents at the train station and travelers.However, a limited vocabulary is a problem ifwe want to model a language model for a systemof recognition of television's programs with awide and varied vocabulary.3 Method to create Tunisian DialectCorporaIn Arabic there are almost no parallel corporainvolving TD and MSA.
Therefore, MachineTranslation (MT) is not easy, especially whenthere are no MT resources available such as natu-rally occurring parallel text or transfer lexicon.So, to deal with this problem, we proposed toleverage the large available annotated MSA re-sources by exploiting MSA/dialect similaritiesand addressing known differences.
Our approachconsists first on studying the morphological, syn-tactic and lexical difference by exploiting thePenn Arabic Treebank.
Second, presenting thesedifferences by developing rules and building dia-lectal concepts.
Finally, storing these transfor-mations into dictionaries.3.1 Penn Arabic TreeBank corpora to cre-ate bilingual lexicon MSA-TDTreebanks, are an important resources that al-lows for important research in general NLP ap-plications.
In the case of Arabic, two importanttreebanking efforts exist: the Penn Arabic Tree-bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al 2004; Maamouriet al 2009) and the Prague Arabic DependencyTreebank (PADT) (Smr?
and Haji, 2007; Smr?
etal., 2008).
The PATB not only provides tokeni-zation, complex POS tags, and syntactic struc-ture; it also provides empty categories,diacritizations, lemma choices.
The PATB con-sists of 23,611 parse-annotated sentences (Biesand Maamouri, 2003; Maamouri and Bies, 2004)from Arabic newswire text in MSA.
The PATBannotation scheme involves 497 different POS-tags with morphological information.
In thiswork we attempted to mitigate the genredifferences by transforming the MSA-ATB tolook like TD-ATB.
This will allow us to create intandem a bilingual lexicon with differentdialectal concept (Figure1).
For this, we adopteda transformation method based on the parts ofspeech of ATB's word.Figure1- Methodology for creating TDresources3.2 Modeling verbal lexical entries for thebilingual dictionaryAs we aim to adapt MSA tools to TD, we tried tobuild for TD verbs the same concepts as those inMSA.
Therefore, we focused in this work on thestudy of correspondence that may exist amongthe concepts of MSA verbs and dialect verbs.
InArabic there are three principal verbal concepts:1-Root: It is the basic source of all forms of Ara-bic verb.
The root is not a real word rather it is asequence of three consonants that can be foundin all words that are related to it.
Most roots arecomposed of three letters, very few are of four orfive consonants.2-Pattern: In MSA, patterns are models with dif-ferent structures that are applied to the root tocreate a lemma.
For example, for the root ?
?
?
:xrj, we can apply different patterns, which givedifferent lemmas with different meaningsRoot1: xrj/ ?
??
/ C1C2C3+ verbal pattern1:AistaC1oC2a3 =lemma1  ??????????
?/ to extractRoot1: xrj/??
?/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern2FoEaL(FaEal)=lemma2   ??????
/ to go out .Root1: xrj ( ?
??
)/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern3>aC1oC2aC3=lemma3  ????????
/ to eject2-Lemma: The lemma is a fundamental conceptin the processing of texts in at least some lan-guages.
Arabic words can be analyzed as consist-ing of a root inserted into a pattern.TD-lemma building: Verbs in the PATB corpusare presented in their inflected forms.
So, we ex-tracted lemmas and their roots using the morpho-logical analyzer developed by Elexir FM (Smrz,2007).
As we are native speakers of TD, we as-sociate to each MSA-Lemma a TUN-Lemma.
Asa result, we found that 60% of verbs change to-tally by passing from MSA to TD.
As we have1500 TD-Lemmas, and starting from the fact that89MSA verbs have patterns describing their mor-phological behavior during conjugation, we triedto assign, if possible, to each TD-Lemma a TD-Pattern.TD-pattern building: The challenge on buildingTD-pattern was to find patterns similar to thosein MSA.
Thus, by studying the morphology ofTD-lemmas, we remarked  that it's possible toassign to TD-lemmas the same pattern as thoseon MSA but with defining other patterns that willbe sub-patterns to these patterns.
In fact, thisprocess has allowed distinguishing 32 patternsfor dialect verbs while there were 15 in MSA.This was due to the morphological richness andthe frequent change of vowel within TD-lemmas.For example:In MSA $Arak/yu$Arik/to participate anddAfaE/yudAFiE/to defend belongs to thepatternII: CACaC(perfectiveform)/yiCACiC(imperfectiveform).
In TD the model of thesetow verbs remains CACVC/yVCACVC but thevowel of the second consonant of the pattern(vowel letter ?
/ E) change.
The mark of thisvowel is a fundamental criterion for classifying averb in MSA (Ouerhani, 2009), that's why weproposed to define tow sub-pattern for the pat-tern II,  by dividing the pattern-II to II-i:CACiC/yVCACiC and II-a:CACaC/yVCACaC.As consequence, $Arak/yu$Arik/ becomes in TD$Arik/yi$Arik/ belongs to CACiC/yVCACiC anddAfaE/yudAFiE becomes in TD dAfaE/yidAFaEbelongs to CACaC/yiVCACaC.Therefore, by adopting this reasoning, we suc-ceeded with the ATB's verbs to define pattern forthe TD verb.
Thus, knowing these new patterns,we will be able to assign a pattern for all TDverbs.TD-root building: In Tunisian dialect, there isno standard definition for the root.
For this, con-struction of root dialect was not obvious, espe-cially when the root verb changes completelythrough the MSA to the dialect.
In fact, to definea root for TD verbs, we have adopted a deductivemethod.
Indeed, in MSA, the rule says: root +pattern= Lemma (1).
In our case, we have al-ready defined the TD-lemma and the TD-pattern.Following rule (1), the extraction of the root isthen made easy.
For example, we classified thelemma ?????
/Aistan ~ aY/Wait in the patternAistaCCaC then root(?)
+ AistaCCaC= ?????
/ ~YAistana~Following (1), the root for the verb  ?????
/Aistan~ aY/Wait is "???"
[NNY].
In fact, we can say thatthe definition of roots is a problematic issuewhich could allow more discussion.
Accordingto (1), it was like we have forced the roots to be[NNY].
However, if we classified Aistann ~ aYunder the pattern AiCCaCal, the root in this casemust be snn.
The root can also be quadrilateral????
/ snnY if we classified Aistann~ aY under thepattern AiCCaCaC.
But as there's no standard,we have done in our best to be the most logicalpossible to define dialectal root.3.3 Structure of verbal lexicon entriesDifferent verbal transformations described aboveare modeled and stored at a dictionary of verb asfollows: to each MSA verbal block containingMSA-lemma, MSA-pattern and MSA-root willcorrespond TD- block which containing TD-lemma, TD-root and TD-pattern.
So, knowingthe pattern and the root we will able to generateautomatically various inflected forms of the TUNverbs.
That?s why we stored in our dictionary theactive and the passive form of the TD-lemma inperfective and imperfective tense.
We also storethe inflected forms in the imperative (CV).
Fig-ure 2 shows the structure that we have definedfor the dictionary to present the TD-verbal con-cepts (in section 4 we will explain how we willautomate the enrichment of this dictionary).<DIC_TUN_VERBS_FORM><LEXICAL-ENTRY POS="VERB"><VERB ID-VERB="48"><MSA-LEMMA><Headword-sa> ???????</Headword-MSA<Pattern>????</Pattern><Root-Msa>??

It has a90large amount in the Treebank and all MSA-texts.However, their transformation was not trivial andrequired, for each tool a study of its differentcontext.
In our approach, we defined two kindsof transformations.
The first requires the study ofdifferent context of a tool word.
In fact, the sameword may have different translations dependingon its context.
Thus, to deal with the variation ofcontext, we developed mapping rules.
Note thatamong these contexts, there are those that causea change in the syntactic order of words by pass-ing to the dialect.
The second transformation isdirect, the word remains unchanged whatever thecontext.3.5 Context dependent transformationWe mean by transformation-based context, thepassage MSA-DT which is based on transfor-mation rules.
Indeed given a word W, we saythat the transformation of W is based on contextif it gives a new translation whenever it changeson context.
RT :  X + W + Y = TDkX =?mj=POSjWj1:; Y = ?n=iPOSiWi1:; k var-ies from 1 to z ;RTk: transformation rules n?k ; POS : Part ofspeech ; W :word tool, TDk: Translation n?kThe transformation of a tool word may depend tothe words that it precedes (X), or the followingword (Y), or both.
If none of the contexts is pre-sented, then a default translation will be assignedto the word tool.
For example, For the tool word"???"
[hatY]/So that  which have the POS: Prep-osition, we developed three different  mappingrules depending to the context in the ATB corpo-ra.1- ?????
/ HatY + verb = ???
(TUN-particle) +TUN_verb2-    ????
?/ HatY + NEG_PART = ???
(TUN-particle)+ TUN_NEG_PARTotherwise3- ????
?/HatY = ?????
/HatYIn total, we developed 316 rules for the ATB'stools words.
Figure 3 shows how we present atransformation rule in the dictionary.
For eachtool word we have defined a set of contexts, eachcontext contains one or more configurations.
Theconfiguration describes the position and the partof speech of the words of context.
Each contextcorresponds to a new translation of the toolword.<PREP-MSA ID="9"><MSA-LEMMA>????

However, the canonical word or-der in Tunisian verbal sentences is SVO (Sub-ject-Verb-Object) (Baccouche , 2004).
In con-trast, MSA word order can have the followingthree forms: SVO / VSO / VOS (2).
(1) TD:  ????????
???????
??????
/AlTfol ktib aldars/the childwrote the lesson: SVO(2) MSA: ?????
???
????
?/ktib Altfol Ald~ars/wrotethe boy the lesson: VSO.This opposition bestween the MSA and the dia-lect is clearer in the case of proper names.
Infact, MSA order is VSO (3) while the order inTD is SVO.

????
/ Alqit >akal Alfi>rAn /Catseat ratsThere are other types of simple dialect sentencesnamed nominal sentences which do not contain averb.
They have the same order in both Tunisianand MSA.
For example:MSA: ?????
???
/TaKs HAr/ weather is hotTD:  ????????
???????
/ TaKs sxuwn/ weather is hotIn our work, we discussed the syntactic level atsome nominal groups.
The word order is general-ly reversed by passing to TD.

This tool works according tothe following steps:1-Morphosyntactic annotation of MSA texts:TDT annotate each MSA textmorphosyntactically by using MADA analyzer(Morphological Analyser and disambiguisator ofArabic) (Habash, 2010).
MADA is a toolkit that,given a raw MSA text, adds as much lexical andmorphological information as possible by disam-biguating in one operation part-of-speech tags,lexemes, diacritizations and full morphologicalanalyses.2-Exploiting MSA-TD Dictionaries: Based oneach part of speech of the MSA-word, TDT pro-pose for each MSA structure the correspondingTD translation by exploiting the MSA-TD dic-tionaries.3-Enriching lexicon:  As the lexical databasedoes not cover all Arabic words, texts resultingfrom the previous step are not totally translated.Therefore, in order to improve the quality oftranslation and to enrich our dictionaries to bewell used even in other NLP application, weadded to TDT a semi-automatic enrichmentmodule.
This module filters first all MSA wordsfor which a translation has not been provided.Then, TDT assigned for them theircorresponding MSA-lemmas and POS, the userproposes, if the POS is verb or noun, a TD-rootand a TD-pattern (described in subsection 3.2)and the TDT proposes automatically theappropriate Tunisian lemma and it's inflectedforms.5 EvaluationTo evaluate different translations of the verbsdictionary, we asked 47 judges (native speakers)to translate a sample containing 10% of verbs inthe dictionary.
The evaluation consists in com-paring what we have proposed as a translation oflexical items taken from the ATB with the pro-posals of judges who are native speakers of Tu-nisian dialect.
The percentages calculated reflectthe percentage of agreement for each verb trans-lations between judges and the translation pro-posed in our lexicon.
Table 1 shows the obtainedresults.Table 1- Evaluation of verb translationFor the same context, an MSA-Verb may havemany translations.
The agreement decreases forchanged verbs because the judges may propose avalid translation different from what we haveproposed in the dictionary.
Moreover, as thetranslation of the majority of tool words dependson context, we asked 5 judges to translate 89sentences containing 133 words tools.
In thissample, we made some tools words repeated inthe same sentence but in different context.

The variation inpercentage is due to the fact that for some words,judges do not agree among themselves.
The tablealso shows the percentage of disagreementbetween judges and dictionaries.2juges3juges4juges5jugesAgree-ment72,69%74,53%71,34%71,23%Dis-greement18,79%15,03%14,28%.12,03%Table 2- Evaluation of   tool word translationIn fact, the disagreement arises when no judgegives translation similar to the translationproposed in the dictionaries.
But, by increasingthe number of judges, the disagreementdecreases which proves that our dictionaries areable to give acceptable translations by severaljudges6 ConclusionThis paper presented an effort to create resourcesand translation tool for Tunisian dialect.To deal with the total lack of written resource inTunisian dialect, we described first a methodolo-gy that allowed the creation of bilingual diction-aries with in tandem TD-ATB.
In fact, TD-ATBwill serve as a source of insight on the phenome-na that need to be addressed and as corpora totrain TD-NLP tools.
We focused second on de-scribing TDT a tool to generate automaticallyTD corpora and to enrich semi-automatically thedictionaries we have built.We plan to continue working on improving theTD-resources by studying the transformation ofnouns.
We also plan to validate our approach bymeasuring the ability of a language model, builton a corpus translated by our TDT tool, to modeltranscriptions of Tunisian broadcast news.Experiments in progress showed that the integra-tion of translated data improves significantly lex-ical coverage and perplexity of language models.ReferencesBies Ann.
