We find that the quality oftranslation alignments and the domain of thebitext are important.
In some settings thesefactors are more critical than corpus size.
Wealso show that judicious choice of tokeniza-tion can reduce the amount of bitext requiredto obtain good bilingual retrieval performance.1 IntroductionLarge parallel corpora are an increasingly availablecommodity.
Such texts are the fuel of statisticalmachine translation systems and are used in appli-cations such as cross-language information retrieval(CLIR).
Several beliefs are commonly held regard-ing the relationship between parallel text quality andsize for CLIR.
It is thought that larger texts shouldbe better, because the problems of data sparsenessand untranslatable terms are reduced.
Similarly, par-allel text from a domain more closely related to adocument collection should lead to better bilingualretrieval performance, again because better lexicaltranslations are available.We compared four sources of parallel text us-ing CLEF document collections in eight languages(Braschler and Peters, 2004).
English topic setsfrom 2000 to 2007 were used.
Corpus-based trans-lation of query terms was performed and documentswere ranked using a statistical language model ap-proach to retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998).
Exper-iments were conducted using unlemmatized wordsand character 5-grams.
No use was made of pre-translation query expansion or automated relevancefeedback.2 Translation CorporaInformation about the four parallel texts used in ourexperiments is provided in Table 1.
We restrictedour focus to Dutch (NL), English (EN), Finnish (FI),French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Portuguese(PT), Spanish (ES), and Swedish (SV).
These lan-guages are covered by each parallel corpus.2.1 BibleThe bible corpus is based on the 66 books in the Oldand New Testaments.
Alignments at the verse levelwere used; there are 31103 verses in the English text.2.2 JRC-Acquis v3This parallel text is based on EU laws comprising theAcquis Communautaire and translations are avail-able in 22 languages.
The English portion of theacquis data includes 1.2 million aligned passagescontaining over 32 million words, which is approxi-mately 40 times larger than the Biblical text.
Align-ments were provided with the corpus and were pro-duced by the Vanilla algorithm.1 The alignments areat roughly the sentence level, but only 85% corre-spond to a single sentence in both languages.2.3 Europarl v3The Europarl corpus was assembled to support ex-periments in statistical machine translation (Koehn,2005).
The documents consist of transcribed dia-logue from the official proceedings of the EuropeanParliament.
We used the precomputed alignmentsthat are provided with the corpus, and which arebased on the algorithm by Gale and Church (1991).The alignments are believed to be of high quality.1Available from http://nl.ijs.si/telri/vanilla/25Name Words Wrds/doc Alignments Genre Sourcebible 785k 25.3 Near Perfect Religious http://unbound.biola.edu/acquis 32M 26.3 Good EU law (1958 to 2006) http://wt.jrc.it/lt/acquis/europarl 33M 25.5 Very Good Parliamentary oration(1996 to 2006)http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ojeu 84M 34.5 Fair Governmental affairs(1998 to 2004)Derived from documents athttp://europea.eu.int/Table 1: Parallel texts used in experiments.2.4 Official Journal of the EUThe Official Journal of the European Union covers awide range of topics such as agriculture, trade, andforeign relations.
We constructed this parallel cor-pus by downloading documents dating from January1998 through April 2004 and converting the textsfrom Adobe?s Portable Document Format (PDF) toISO-8859-1 encoded text using pdftotext.
The doc-uments were segmented into pages and into para-graphs consisting of a small number of sentences(typically 1 to 3); however this process was compli-cated by the fact that many documents have outlineor tabular formatting.
Alignments were producedusing Church?s char align software (1993).Due to complexities of decoding the PDF, some ofthe accented characters were not extracted properly,but this is a problem mostly for the earlier materialin the collection.
In total about 85 million words oftext per language was obtained, which is over twicethe size of either the acquis or europarl collections.3 TranslationUsing the pairwise-aligned corpora described above,parallel indexes for each corpus were created usingwords and 5-grams.
Query translation was accom-plished as follows.
For each query term s, sourcelanguage documents from the aligned collection thatcontain s are identified.
If no document contains thisterm, then it is left untranslated.
Each target lan-guage term t appearing in the corresponding docu-ments is scored:Score(t) = (Fl(t)?
Fc(t))?
IDF (t)1.25 (1)where Fl and Fc are relative document frequenciesbased on local subset of documents and the wholecorpus.
IDF (t) is the inverse document frequency,or log2( Ndf(t)).
The candidate translation with thehighest score replaced the original query term andthe transformed query vector is used for retrievalagainst the target language collection.This is a straightforward approach to query trans-lation.
More sophisticated methods have been pro-posed, including bidirectional translation (Wang andOard, 2006) and use of more than one translationcandidate per query term (Pirkola et al, 2003).Subword translation, the direct translation ofcharacter n-grams, offers several advantages overtranslating words (McNamee and Mayfield, 2005).N-grams provide morphological normalization,translations of multiword expressions are suggestedby translation of word-spanning n-grams, and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words can be be partly trans-lated with n-gram fragments.
Additionally, there arefew OOV n-grams, at least for n = 4 and n = 5.4 Experimental ResultsWe describe two experiments.
The first examinesthe efficacy of the different translation resources andthe second measures the relationship between cor-pus size and retrieval effectiveness.
English was thesole source language.4.1 Translation ResourcesFirst the relationship between translation source andbilingual retrieval effectiveness is studied.
Table 2reports mean average precision when word-based to-kenization and translation was performed for eachof the target collections.
For comparison the cor-responding performance using topics in the targetlanguage (mono) is also given.
As expected, thesmallest bitext, bible, performs the worst.
Averagedacross the eight languages only 39% relative effec-tiveness is seen compared to monolingual perfor-mance.
Reports advocating the use of religious textsfor general purpose CLIR may have been overly op-timistic (Chew et al, 2006).

Though nearly twice the size, ojeufails to outperform europarl and just barely beatsacquis.
Likely reasons for this include difficultiesproperly converting the ojeu data to text, problem-atic alignments, and the substantially greater lengthof the aligned passages.The same observations can be seen from Table 3where 5-grams were used for tokenization and trans-lation instead of words.
The level of performancewith 5-grams is higher and these improvements arestatistically significant with p < 0.01 (t-test).2 Av-eraged across the eight languages gains from 30% to47% were seen using 5-grams, depending on the re-source.
As a translation resource europarl still out-performs the other sources in each of the eight lan-guages and the relative ordering of {europarl, ojeu,acquis, bible} is the same in both cases.2Except in four cases: mono: In ES & IT p < 0.05; bible:5-grams were not significantly different than words in FI & SV4.2 Size of Parallel TextTo investigate how corpus size effects bilingualretrieval we subsampled europarl and used thesesmaller subcorpora for translation.
The entire cor-pus is 33 million words in size, and samples of 1%,2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% were madebased on counting documents, which for europarlis equivalent to counting sentences.
Samples weretaken by processing the data in chronological order.In Figure 1 (a-d) the effect of using larger parallelcorpora is plotted for four languages.
Mean averageprecision is on the vertical axes, and for visual effectthe chart for each language pair uses the same scale.The general shape of the curves is to rise quickly asincreasing subsets from 1% to 10% are used and toflatten as size increases further.
Curves for the otherfour languages (not shown) are quite similar.
Thedeceleration of improvement with increasing cor-pus size can be explained by Heap?s Law.
Similarresults have been obtained in the few studies thathave sought to quantify bilingual retrieval perfor-mance as a function of translation resource size (Xuand Weischedel, 2000; Demner-Fushman and Oard,2003).
In the higher complexity languages such asGerman and Finnish, n-grams appear to be gaininga slight improvement even when the entire corpus isused; vocabulary size is greater in those languages.The data for the 0% condition were based oncognate matches for words and ?cognate n-grams?that require no translation.
The figure reveals thateven very small amounts of parallel text quickly im-prove performance.
The 2% condition is roughly thesize of bible, but is higher performing, likely dueto a better domain match.3 Using a subsample ofonly 5% of available data from the highest perform-ing translation resource, europarl, 5-grams outper-formed plain words using any amount of bitext.5 ConclusionWe examined issues in corpus-based bilingual re-trieval, including the importance of parallel corpusselection and size, and the relative effectiveness ofalternative tokenization methods.
Size is not theonly important factor in corpus-based bilingual re-3For example, the Biblical text does not contain the wordsnuclear or energy and thus is greatly disadvantaged for a topicabout nuclear power.27(a) German (b) Spanish(c) Finnish (d) French?????????????????????????????

Large relative improvements(over 30%) were observed with 5-grams, and whenonly limited parallel data is available for translation,n-grams are markedly more effective than words.Future work could address some limitations of thepresent study by using bidirectional translation mod-els, considering other language families and sourcelanguages other than English, and applying queryexpansion techniques.ReferencesMartin Braschler and Carol Peters.
