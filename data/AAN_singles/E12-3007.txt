Uni-, bi- and trigrams were usedon four 19th century French short stories byMaupassant.
For high-dimensional embed-dings, power transformations on the chi-squared distances between clauses were ex-plored.
Preliminary results show that high-dimensional embeddings improve the qual-ity of clustering, contrasting the use of bi-and trigrams whose performance is disap-pointing, possibly because of feature spacesparsity.1 IntroductionThe aim of this research is to cluster textual se-quence types (named here discourse types)1, suchas narrative, descriptive, argumentative and so onin French texts, and especially in short storieswhich could contain all types.For this purpose, texts were segmented intoclauses (section 2.1).
To cluster the latter, n-gramPOS (part-of-speech) tag profiles were extracted(section 2.3).
POS-tags were chosen because oftheir expected relation to discourse types.Several authors have used POS-tags amongother features for various text classification tasks,such as Biber (1988) for text type detection, Karl-gren and Cutting (1994) and Malrieu and Rastier1Sequence type is an appropriate name, because it refersto text passage type.
However, it will be further mentionedas discourse types, a frequent French term.
In English, astandard term is: discourse modes.
(2001) for genre classification, and Palmer et al(2007) for situation entity classification.
The lat-ter is an essential component of English discoursemodes (Smith, 2009).
Moreover, previous work indiscourse type detection has shown a dependencybetween POS-tags and these types (Cocco et al,2011).In this paper, K-means algorithm with high-dimensional embeddings and fuzzy clustering al-gorithm were applied on uni-, bi- and trigramPOS-tag profiles (section 2.4) and results wereevaluated (section 2.5).
Finally, results are givenin section 3.2 Method2.1 Expert assessmentThe human expert, a graduate student in Frenchlinguistics, annotated 19th century French shortstories by Maupassant, using XML tags.
Eachtext was first segmented into clauses, whoselength is typically shorter than sentences.
Then,texts were annotated retaining the following sixdiscourse types: narrative, argumentative, de-scriptive, explicative, dialogal and injunctive.2They resulted from an adaptation of the work ofAdam (2008a; 2008b) in text and discourse analy-sis, as well as Bronckart (1996) in psycholinguis-tics, concerning textual sequence types.
The for-mer does not consider the injunctive type.Let us briefly describe these types (Adam,2008a; Adam, 2008b; Bronckart, 1996), togetherwith the criteria finally adopted by the human ex-pert for this time-consuming task.2Regarding English, there are five discourse modes ac-cording to Smith (2009): narrative, description, report, in-formation and argument.55Narrative type corresponds to told narrative.One of the principal linguistic markers of thistype is the presence of past historic tense.
How-ever, when referring to repeated actions, imperfecttense is generally used.
Argumentative type cor-responds to texts whose aim is to convince some-body of an argument.
An important linguisticmarker of this type is the presence of argumen-tative connectors such as mais ?but?, cependant?however?, pourtant ?yet?
and so on.
Explica-tive type aims to explain something unknown,such as encyclopaedic knowledge, and answersto the question ?Why??.
A typical linguisticmarker of this type is the presence of phraseo-logical phrases, such as (si)...c?est parce que/c?estpour que ?
(if)...it is because/in order to?.
De-scriptive type represents textual parts where thetime of the story stops and where characteristicproperties of a subject, animated or not, are at-tributed.
Several linguistic markers are relevantfor this type: use of imperfect tense (except whenthe narrative part is in present tense); a large num-ber of adjectives; spatio-temporal organizers; andstative verbs.
Dialogal type is a verbal exchange.However, in this project, direct speech is consid-ered as dialogal too.
Typical linguistic markersof this type are quotes, strong punctuation andchange of spatio-temporal frame.
Finally, injunc-tive type is an incentive for action.
This type haslinguistic markers such as use of imperative tenseand exclamation marks.
In our corpus, this type isalways included in a dialogal segment.Discourse types are generally nested insideeach other resulting in a hierarchical structure.For instance, an injunctive sequence of one clauselength can be included in a dialogal sequence,which can in turn be included in a longer nar-rative sequence matching the entire text.
In thesimplified treatment attempted here, the problemis linearized: only the leaves of the hierarchicalstructure will be considered.2.2 CorpusThe corpus consists of four 19th century Frenchshort stories by Maupassant: ?L?Orient?
, ?LeVoleur?, ?Un Fou??
and ?Un Fou?.
Descriptivestatistics about these texts are given in table 1.These values are based on unigram counts.
Forbigram and trigram counts, clauses shorter thantwo and three words respectively were removed.For the first text, ?L?Orient?, three clauses wereremoved for trigrams; for ?Le Voleur?, one clausewas removed for trigrams; and for ?Un Fou?
?,thirteen clauses for trigrams.
An extra step wasmade for ?Un Fou?, because of its very differentstructure w.r.t.
the three other texts.
Indeed, themajority of this text is written as a diary.
Dates,which could not be attributed to a discourse type,were consequently removed, reducing the numberof clauses from 401 to 376 for unigrams.
Then,two clauses were removed for bigrams becausethey were too short, and again ten for trigrams.2.3 PreprocessingBefore applying clustering algorithms, annotatedtexts were preprocessed to obtain a suitablecontingency table, and dissimilarities betweenclauses were computed.
Firstly, each text wasPOS-tagged with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) ex-cluding XML tags.
Secondly, using the manualclause segmentation made by the human expert,distributions over POS-tag n-grams were obtainedfor each clause, resulting in a contingency table.Then, chi-squared distances between clauseswere computed.
In order to accomplish this, co-ordinates of the contingency table (with nik de-noting the number of objects common to clausei and POS-tag n-gram k, ni?
=?k nik andn?k =?i nik) are transformed in this manner:yik =eikfi??k??
?k (1)where eik = nik/n are the relative counts, fi =ei?
= ni?/n (row weights) and ?k = e?k =n?k/n (column weights) are the margin counts.Finally, the squared Euclidean distances betweenthese new coordinatesDij =?k(yik ?
yjk)2 (2)define the chi-squared distances.2.4 AlgorithmsTwo algorithms were applied on these distances.K-means with high-dimensional embeddingFirstly, the well-known K-means (see e.g.
Man-ning and Schu?tze (1999)) was performed in aweighted version (i.e.
longer clauses are more im-portant than shorter ones), by iterating the follow-ing pair of equations:zgi ={1 if g = argminhDhi0 else.

The last columns give the percentage of clauses for each discourse type (arg =argumentative, descr = descriptive, dial = dialogal, expl = explicative, inj = injunctive, nar = narrative).Dgi =?jfgj Dij ?
?g (4)where zgi is the membership of clause i in groupg and Dgi is the chi-squared distance betweenthe clause i and the group g as resulting fromthe Huygens principle.
In the equation 4, fgj =(fizig)/?g = p(i|g), Dij is the chi-squared dis-tances between clauses given by the equation 2and ?g = 1/2?jk fgj fgkDjk is the inertia ofgroup g. In addition, ?g =?i fizig = p(g) isthe relative weight of group g.At the outset, the membership matrix Z waschosen randomly, and then the iterations werecomputed until stabilisation of the matrix Z or anumber of maximum iterations Nmax.Besides the K-means algorithm, Schoenbergtransformations ?
(D) were also operated.
Theytransform the original squared Euclidean dis-tances D into new squared Euclidean distances?
(D) (Bavaud, 2011) and perform a high-dimensional embedding of data, similar to thoseused in Machine Learning.
Among all Schoen-berg transformations, the simple componentwisepower transformation was used, i.e.?
(Dij) = (Dij)q (5)where 0 < q ?
1.In a nutshell, the K-means algorithm was ap-plied on the four texts, for uni-, bi- and trigramsPOS-tags, with q in equation 5 varying from 0.1to 1 with steps of 0.05.
Given that the aim wasto find the six groups annotated by the human ex-pert, the K-means algorithm was computed with anumber of groupsm = 6.
Moreover, Nmax = 400and for each q, calculations were run 300 times,and then the averages of the relevant quantities(see section 2.5) were computed.Fuzzy clusteringSecondly, the same algorithm which was used ina previous work (Cocco et al, 2011) was appliedhere, i.e.
the fuzzy clustering algorithm.In brief, it consists of iterating, as for the K-means, the membership zgi of clause i in group gdefined in the following way (Rose et al, 1990;Bavaud, 2009):zgi =?g exp(?
?Dgi )m?h=1?h exp(?
?Dhi )(6)until stabilisation of the membership matrix Z(randomly chosen at the beginning as uniformlydistributed over the m groups) or after Nmax itera-tions.
Dgi is given by equation 4 and ?g is the rela-tive weight of group g. Moreover, it turns out con-venient to set ?
:= 1/(trel??
), the ?inverse tem-perature?
parameter, where ?
:= 12?ij fifjDijis the inertia and trel is the relative temperaturewhich must be fixed in advance.The values of ?
controls for the bandwidthof the clustering, i.e.
the number of groups: thehigher ?, the larger the final number of groupsM (see figure 9).
As a matter of fact, depend-ing of ?
values, group profiles are more or lesssimilar.
Also, group whose profiles are simi-lar enough are aggregated, reducing the num-ber of groups from m (initial number of groupschosen at the beginning) to M .
This aggrega-tion is made by adding memberships of clauses:z[g?h]i = zgi + zhi .
Two groups are consideredsimilar enough if ?gh/?
?gg?hh ?
1?10?5, with?gh =?ni=1 fizgi zhi which measures the overlapbetween g and h (Bavaud, 2010).
Finally, eachclause is attributed to the most probable group.For the application in this project, fuzzy clus-tering algorithm was computed on the four texts,57for uni- bi- and trigrams POS-tags.
At the outset,the initial number of groups m was equal to thenumber of clauses for each text (see table 1 andsection 2.2), with a relative temperature trel from0.022 to 0.3 with steps of 0.001 (except for thetext ?Un Fou?
with trel min = 0.02, trel max = 0.3and trel step = 0.01).
Besides this, Nmax = 400and for each trel, algorithm was run 20 times, andfinally the averages of the relevant quantities (seesection 2.5) were computed.2.5 Evaluation criteriaThe clustering obtained by the two algorithms(K-means with high-dimensional embedding andfuzzy clustering) were compared to the classifi-cation made by the human expert.
As clusteringinduces anonymous partitions, traditional indicessuch as precision, recall and Cohen?s Kappa can-not be computed.Among the numerous similarity indices be-tween partitions, we have examined the Jaccardindex (Den?ud and Gue?noche, 2006; Younessand Saporta, 2004):J = rr + u + v (7)whose values vary between 0 and 1, and thecorrected Rand index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985;Den?ud and Gue?noche, 2006):RC = r ?
Exp(r)Max(r)?
Exp(r) (8)whose the maximal value is 1.
When this indexequals 0, it means that similarities between par-titions stem from chance.
However, it can alsotake negative values when number of similaritiesis lower than the expectation (i.e.
chance).Both indices are based upon the contingencytable nij , defined by the number of objects at-tributed simultaneously to group i (w.r.t.
thefirst partition) and to group j (w.r.t.
the sec-ond partition).
Moreover, in both indices, r =12?ij nij(nij ?

?ij n2ij) (respectively v = 12(?i n2i??

1).3 ResultsOn the one hand, results obtained with the K-means algorithm and power (q) transformationsfor uni-, bi- and trigrams are presented in figures1 to 8.
On the other hand, results obtained withfuzzy clustering for uni- bi- and trigrams are onlyshown for the text ?Le Voleur?
in figures 9 to 13.For the three other texts, results will be discussedbelow.0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.000.010.020.030.040.05Power (q)Corrected Rand IndexFigure 1: ?L?Orient?

The standarddeviation is approximatively constant across q rangingfrom a minimum of 0.018 and a maximum of 0.024(unigrams); 0.0099 and 0.015 (bigrams); 0.0077 and0.013 (trigrams).A first remark is that corrected Rand index andJaccard index behave differently in general.
Thisdifference is a consequence of the fact that Jac-card index does not take into account the numberof pairs simultaneously separated in the two par-titions, a fact criticised by Milligan and Cooper(1986).Regarding the texts ?L?Orient?, ?Le Voleur?and ?Un Fou??
with K-means algorithm and thecorrected Rand index (figures 1, 3 and 5), un-igrams give the best results.
Moreover, powertransformations (equation 5) tend to improvethem.
For instance, for the text ?L?Orient?
(figure1), the best result is RC = 0.048 with q = 0.55,and for the text ?Un Fou??

num-ber of groups decreases when relative tempera-ture increases.

The same phenomenon appears with thetext ?Un Fou?

Besides,for these two texts, corrected Rand index takesnegative values, especially for ?Un Fou?.
Whilethe reason for these different behaviours is notknown, it should be noted that the structure ofthese texts is different from that of the two othertexts.
Indeed, ?Un Fou?

contains several longmonologues mainly using the present tense too.On figure 12, it appears that Jaccard index isconstant when one group remains, and the samephenomenon appears for all texts.
Indeed, fromthe distribution of table 2, one finds from equa-tion 7: r = 8939, u = 0 and v = 12 589, imply-ing J = 0.415.Overall, it is clear that results differ depend-ing on texts, no matter which algorithm or eval-uation criterion is used.
Furthermore, they arealways better for ?Le Voleur?
than for the three61arg descr dial expl inj nar10 25 29 10 6 128Table 2: Types distribution for the text ?Le Voleur?.other texts.Finally, in most case, unigrams give betterresults than bi- and tri-grams.
The relativelydisappointing performance of bi- and trigrams(w.r.t.
unigrams) could be accounted for by thesparsity of the feature space and the well-knownassociated ?curse of dimensionality?, in particularin clustering (see e.g.
Houle et al (2010)).
Resultsare clearly different for ?Un Fou?, and the reasonof this difference still needs to be investigated.Certainly, as the sample is small and there is aunique annotator, all these results must be consid-ered with caution.4 Conclusion and further developmentA first conclusion is that the use of POS-tag n-grams does not seem to improve the solution ofthe problem exposed here.
In contrast, high-dimensional embedding seems to improve results.Concerning evaluation criteria, results clearlyvary according to the selected index, which makesit difficult to compare methods.
Another point isthat even choosing only short stories of one au-thor, text structures can be very different and cer-tainly do not give the same results.These results are interesting and in general bet-ter than those found in a previous work (Coccoet al, 2011), but this is still work in progress,with much room for improvement.
A next stepwould be to combine fuzzy clustering with high-dimensional embedding, which can both improveresults.
Moreover, it could be interesting to addtypical linguistic markers, such as those men-tioned in section 2.1, or stylistic features.
It wouldalso be possible to use lemmas instead of or withPOS-tags, if more data could be added to the cor-pus.
Besides, Cordial Analyseur 3 could be usedinstead of TreeTagger, because it provides morefine-grained POS-tags.
However, as for n-grams,it could imply a sparsity of the feature space.
An-other idea would be to perform a supervised clas-sification with cross-validation.
In this case, it3http://www.synapse-fr.com/Cordial_Analyseur/Presentation_Cordial_Analyseur.htmwould be interesting to investigate feature selec-tion (see e.g.
Yang and Pedersen (1997)).
Also,the hierarchical structure of texts (cf.
section 2.1)should be explored.
Only the leaves were con-sidered here, but in reality, one clause belongs toseveral types depending on the hierarchical levelexamined.
Therefore, it could be relevant to con-sider the dominant discourse type instead of theleaf discourse type.
Similarly, since in our cor-pus, injunctive type is always included in dialo-gal type, the former could be removed to obtaina larger dialogal class.
In addition, it would beuseful to find a better adapted measure of sim-ilarity between partitions.
Finally, an importantimprovement would be to obtain more annotatedtexts, which should improve results, and a secondhuman expert, which would permit us to assessthe difficulty of the task.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Franc?ois Bavaud and ArisXanthos for helpful comments and useful discus-sions; Guillaume Guex for his help with techni-cal matters; and Raphae?l Pittier for annotating thegold standard.ReferencesJean-Michel Adam.
