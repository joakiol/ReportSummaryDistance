The framework we propose offers a varietyof subtle parameters on which scalable textsummarlzahon can be based1 In t roduct ionFrom its very begmmng, the development of textunderstanding systems has been mhmately trod tothe field of knowledge representahon a d reasoningmethods (Schank ~ Abelson 77) ThLs close rela-tionship was justtfied by the observation that anyadequate form of text understanding ot only re-qmres grammatical knowledge about the particularlanguage, but also, among others, has to incorporateknowledge about the dommn the text deals withThus, the referencing capabdltms of knowledge rep-resentation languages were conmdered crucial for anyadequate design of text understanding systemsOut of thLs tradlhon a series of knowledge-basedtext summarizahon systems evolved, the method-ology of whlch was almost exclnslvely based on.the Schanklan-type of Conceptual Dependency (CD)representations (e g, (Culhngford 78, Lehnert 81,DeJong 82, Dyer.
83, Trot 85, Alterman 86)) CDrepresentations, however, are formally underspecl-fled representation devices lacking any serious formalfoundatlon According to thin, the summanzahonoperatlons these first-generatlon systems provide useonly informal heurlshcs to determine the sahent top-Ics from the text representahon structures for thepurpose of summanzatlon A second generahon ofsummarlzahon systems then adapted a more ma-ture knowledge representahon approach, one basedon the evolvlng methodolo~cM framework of hy-brid, dasslficatlon-based knowledge representahonlanguages (cf (Woods & Schmolze 92) for a survey)Among these systems count SUSY (Fum et al85),SC ISOR (Ran 87), and TOP IC  (Rennet & Hahn88), but even m these frameworks no attempt wasmade to properly integrate the text summarlzahonprocessmto the formal reasomag mechanmms of theunderlying knowledge representahon languageThin m where our interest comes in We proposehere.
a model of text summarlzatlon that m entirelyembedded m the framework of a clasmficatlon-basedmodel of termmologlcal reasoning Text summa-rlzahon m conmdered a formally gulded transfor-mation process on knowledge representahon struc-tures, the so-called text knowledge base, as derivedby a natural language text parser The transforma-hons revolved inherit the formal rigor of the underly-Ing knowledge representatlon model, as correspond-mg summarlzahon operators bmld on that modelThus, our work describes a methodologlcally coher-ent, representahon-theory-based approach to textsummarlzahon that has been lacking m the htera-ture so far (for a survey cf (Hutchms 87)) Asidefrom these purely representahonal conslderahons,the terminological reasoning framework for the sum-manzatlon model we propose offers a variety of sub-tle parameters on whlch scalable summarization pro-cesses can be based Thin contrasts, m particular,wlth those approaches to text summanzahon whlchalmost entlrely rely upon bmlt-m features of frameand scrlpt-based representatlons and, consequently,97provide rather mmpie reduction heunstxcs m order toproduce text summarms (e g ,  (DeJong 82, YoungHayes 85)) The formal model we present has beentested m TOPIC  (Re!met & Hahn 88), a text sum-manzat~an system Which has been apphed to expos-~tory texts m the domain of computer eqmpment aswell as to various kinds of texts dealing with legallssUes (company regulations, adwsory texts, etc )This paper m organized as follows In Section 2 welay down a description of the syntax and semanticsof the terminological logic which serves as the formalbackbone for the specification of condensation oper-ators on (text) knowledge bases From thin formaldescnptmn we then turn to the formal model of textsummarization m Section 32 The Terminological KnowledgeRepresentation ModelIn the following, we describe a subset of a termi-nological logic (for an introduction to ~ts underlyingbasic notatlonal conventions, cf (Woods & Schmolze92)) Sectmn 2 1 considers the terminological com-ponent, whde Section 2 2 deals with appropriate ex-tensions for representing text-specific knowledge2.1 .The Basic Terminological ComponentWe dmtmgmsh two kinds of relations, namely prop-erttes and conceptual relationships A property de-notes a relation between individuals and string orinteger values A conceptual relatsonshsp denotes arelation between two mchv~duals The concept de-scription language prowdes constructs to formulatenecessary (and possibly sufllcmnt) conditions on theproperties and conceptual relationships every ele-ment of a concept class m reqmred to have Thesyntax of thin language m given m Fig 1Oe,m,~oto~) = (~onc- , .~o)"(co~ ,~tro) = (co.~ .am~) < (~'~Pd(c-ezpr) ---- (and (c-ezpr)++) l (conc-name) \[(all-p (prop-name) (prop-range)) \[(all-r (rel-name) (conc-name) + I "(exlst-v (prop-name) (value)) \[(exlst-c (rel-name ) .

In the course of text analysm, theparser extends thin dommn knowledge incrementallyby new concept definltlons In order to dlstmgumh.between prior dommn knowledge and newly acqmredtext knowledge we extend our basic terminologicallanguage wlth the constructs specified m Fig 3 Theoperator _~T mdlcates a pnmltlve concept originatemg from the text analysm Only a Im~ited numberof constructs can be used for such a concept defim-tlon - they correspond to the kinds of knowledge theparser can extract from a text (see Fig 5)?
A new concept can only be acquired when thetext makes a reference to a superordmate con-cept already known m the domain knowledgeThus, the concept expression on the right-handside of the _(T construct must comprme a ref-erence to a superordmate concept, as expressed98IIIIIII?
