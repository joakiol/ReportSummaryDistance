Thus, we take a different ap-proach; an instructor corrects the contents and itscorrection is embedded into the contents in an XMLformat called KeML.
The key/mouse operations ofthe user are also embedded as annotations.
Thus,the contents can be incomplete at the initial stageand become solid gradually as being utilized.
Wehave implemented an e-learning system of group dis-cussion for a foreign language class, which is demon-strated at the workshop.1 IntroductionMany old e-learning systems asked the user to clickthe button or to type a unique answer.
The domainsof the e-learning systems were limited by their ap-proaches and their contents were fixed.
This paperintroduces a new approach to expand the domain.Namely, the user himself annotates the contents inaddition to the instructor.Annotated contents can be used for further learn-ing such as example-based learning and group learn-ing.
The burden of building e-learning contents areso heavy that this ?annotated contents become othercontents?
scheme is important for practical applica-tions.
Annotations are attached in an XML format.This project can be considered as another applica-tion of XML technologies, like MATE [1] [2] or Anvil[3] to name a few.
The principal difference is thatsome annotations are implicitly attached and usedfor NLP.2 System OverviewHere we consider the debate discussion for a for-eign language class as an example.
This course wasoriginally taught in a regular classroom and throughan electronic chatting board supervised by a humaninstructor.
One student posts his/her thought inEnglish and others express positive or negative re-sponses to it.
Since this is a foreign language appre-hension class, the instructor corrects the students?English if necessary.
Since students express variousopinions, we cannot prepare for them in advance.The instructor was occupied with correcting syntac-tic errors, therefore, the instructor could not thor-oughly pay attention to the flow of the debate or towhether students had appropriately expressed theiropinions.In Figure 1 example debate submissions are shownon the topic ?English should be taught at an elemen-tary school.?
#n indicates the submitted order andP1, P2, ... stand for the identifier of the debaters.
(We will further explain Figure 1 later.
)Our system is designed for multi-user discussion,not for self-learning.
Thus, we divide the systeminto the server and the client machines as shown inFigure 2 (only one client machine is drawn in thefigure).
The server machine manages the contentsand handles computationally heavy NLP, while eachclient machine is responsible for user interface.We have developed an e-learning system which of-fers the process above.
Here we describe five impor-tant modules:?
Sentence analysis module: In this module theinput sentences are parsed and tagged syntac-tically and semantically in the GDA (GlobalDocument Annotation) [4] format.
We haveadopted the Charniak parser [5], which is cus-tomized so that the head word is identified be-cause the GDA tagging requires the attachmentdirection between phrases.
The GDA taggerconsults the WordNet [6] to find the root formof a word.
GDA tags can be utilized for suchfurther NLP as high quality summarization orinformation retrieval [7].?
KWIC module: Novice English learners of-ten make such mistakes in collocations and inphrasal verbs.
These word-usage mistakes canbe effectively resolved by looking at examplesentences rather than by consulting a regulardictionary.
This module presents the corpussentences in the KWIC (KeyWord in Context)format in which the specified words are in-cluded.
Although any corpus will do for KWIC,we have chosen the EDR English corpus [8]which consists of 125,820 tagged sentences.
Be-cause the root form of each word is described asa tag, conjugated forms are also searched.?
Annotation module: The instructor corrects thewrong usages of the students?

Preserving the originals is ef-fective for education; it can prevent other stu-dents from making the similar mistakes.

Interface module: This module enables the userto type in sentences, specify what part he isarguing about, express his/her attitude, etc, ef-ficiently.
This module displays the contents ef-fectively according to the needs of the user withthe help of annotations.
Our current interfacesnapshot is shown in Figure 3.?
Debate Flow moduleIt is important to know the debate flow whenone expresses his/her opinion.
Since the rela-tions among statements are annotated, preciseanalysis of the debate flow is possible.In the following sections, the annotation moduleis explained deeply.3 Annotation by the Instructor andStudentsWhen a student expresses his/her opinion in re-sponse to someone else?s, he can specify and denotewhat part he is arguing about.
This linkage is an-notated by the user and recorded in the contents.The corrections/comments by the instructor are alsostored in the learning contents as annotations.
Ar-rows in Figure 1 show the relation of statements,where a dotted line expresses the linkage denoted bythe instructor, and solid lines mean that the debaterspecified those relations.4 The Tag Set for DebateWe have defined a tag set for annotating debatesin an XML format called KeML (Keio e-learningMarkup Language).
Here we describe our tag setalong with how each tag is attached through opera-tions by the instructor or students.<debate> encloses the whole debate and is at-tached when a new debate starts.
No at-tribute is allowed.
Possible child-nodes are one<proposition> and zero or more <statement>s.<proposition> is attached when a new propositionis submitted.
Its mandatory attribute is ?id?and whose value is always ?0?.
Its child-nodeis <su> of GDA.
The instructor or studentsshould remark the proposition as pros or cons.<statement> This tag is attached when a state-ment to a proposition or other statements issubmitted by the instructor or students.
Itsmandatory attributes are ?attitude?
whose valuewould be pro or con, ?person?
whose value in-dicates who submitted that statement, ?time?which indicates when that statement was given,and ?id?
number (an integer).
The values of thefirst two attributes are given by the user explic-itly, while those of the last two are filled by thesystem.
Its optional attributes are ?approval?,?refutation?, ?supplement?, ?summary?, ?ques-tion?, and ?answer?
(some of those attributes ap-pear in Figure 1).
They are expressed as ?ap-proval=target id?
for example.
Its child-node is<su> of GDA.Such tags below the <su> level as <np> or <v>are attached by the parser according to theGDA specifications.
Every tag must have ?id?attribute and its value is filled automatically bythe server.Appendix shows the annotated contents of the de-bate example in Figure 1.5 Preserving Corrected ContentsIn order that a novice student could observe mis-takes by other students, our system preserves theoriginal contents and shows them effectively whenneeded.
While some mistakes are obvious, othersare not.
Only the instructor can correct or commentthose errors and KeML offers two levels of correctionpreservation.
Obvious mistakes are stored as thevalue of ?original?
attribute; ?<np original=?tought?..>taught</np>?
for instance.
Unobvious mistakesare commented in the value of ?comment?
attribute;?<su comment=?This is a comment for this sen-tence.?
....</su>?
for example.
When further cor-rection is made against already corrected contents,only the very first version is preserved.
Our currentimplementation allows the correction/comments un-der <su> nodes.6 ConclusionsWe have implemented an e-learning system which fa-cilitates group-discussion for second language learn-ing.
Plain texts become solid as being used becauseof the embedded explicit and implicit annotations bythe instructor and students.
Accumulated contentswill be a good resource for statistical analysis andexample-based learning.References[1] MATE Workbench Homepage:http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/?
