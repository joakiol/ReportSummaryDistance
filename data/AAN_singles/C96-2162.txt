jpAbstractThis paper presents a unified theory ofverbal irony tbr developing a computa-tional model of irony.
The theory claimsthat an ironic utterance implicitly com-municates the fact that its utterance sit-uation is surrounded by ironic environ-ment which has three properties, buthearers can assume an utterance to beironic even when they recognize thatit implicitly communicates only two ofthe three properties.
Implicit commu-nication of three properties is accom-plished in such a way that an utterancealludes to the speaker's expectation, vi-olates pragmatic principles, and impliesthe speaker's emotional attitude.
Thispaper also describes a method for com-putationally formalizing ironic environ-ment and its implicit communication us-ing situation theory with action theory.1 Introduct ionAlthough non-literal anguage such as metaphorhas become a popular topic in computational lin-guistics (Fass et al, 1991), no attention has beengiven to ironic uses of language.
One reason forthis imbalance is that traditional accounts of irony- and even default logic forlnalization (Perrault,1990) - assume that irony communicates the op-posite of the literal meaning.
This assumptionleads to the misconception that irony is governedonly by a simple inversion mechanism, and thus ithas no theoretical interest.
Another reason is thatstudies of irony have been regarded as of no prac-tical use for NLP systems.
However, recent ac-counts denying the meaning-inversion assumptionhave revealed that irony is a more complicatedpragmatic phenomenon governed by several men-tal processes (Kumon-Nakamnra et al, 1995), anddmt irony offers an effective way of accomplishingw~rious communication goals that are diff\]cult oconvey literally (Roberts and Kreuz, \]994).The aim of this paper is to propose a unifiedtheory of irony that answers to three crucial ques-tions in an unequivocal manner: (Q1) what areproperties that distinguish irony from non-ironicutterances, (Q2) how do hearers recognize utter-ances to be ironic, and (Q3) what do ironic ut-terances convey to he~rers?
Our theory providesa computationally feasible framework of irony asthe first, step toward a full-fledged computationalmodel of irony, and it can account for several em-pirical findings fi'om psycholinguistics.
The essen-tial idea underlying our theory is that an ironicutterance implicitly displays ironic environment,a special situation which has three properties forbeing ironic, but the hearer does not have to see allthe three properties implicitly communicated inorder to recognize the utterance to be ironic.
Notethat this paper focuses only on verbal irony, andthus situational irony I (i.e., situations are ironic)is beyond the scope of our theory.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2discusses the problems of previous irony theories.Section 3 presents our unified theory of irony thatcan cope with the problems, and its computationalformalization.
Finally, Section 4 suggests that ourtheory agrees well with several empirical findings.2 Prev ious  theories of ironySeveral irony theories have been proposed in thelast few decades, but all the theories, as we willexplain, make the same mistake in that they con-fuse the two difl'erent questions (Q1) and (Q2).The traditional pragmatic theory (Grice, 1975;Haverkate, 1990) assumes that, an utterance isrecognized to be ironic when tile hearer becomesaware of an apparent violation of some pragmaticprinciples (e.g,, the maxim of quality or the sincer-ity conditions for speech acts), and as a result itconveys the opposite of the literal meaning.
Thistheory, howew,~r, colnpletely fails to explain manyironic utterances.
First, irony can be comnmni-cared by various expressions that do not includesuch violation: true assertions uch as (2a) in Fig-ure 1, understatements such as (2c), and echoicutterances uch as (5a).
Moreover, Candy's hus-band of Example i can t)erceive Candy's ~ttter-ances ( la )~( le)  as ironic even under the situationwhere he does not know or is careless of Candy'sexpectation of satisfy her hunger, in other words,where he is not aware of the viQlation.
This im-1Situational irony can be indicated by metarefer-ential expressions such as "It is ironic that...", butverbal irony is incomt)atible with such expressions.962Example  1: Candy baked a pizza to satisilg herhunger.
When she was dishing it, uI), her hus-band entered t;he kitchen and gobbled up thewhole pizza.
Candy said to her huslmnd:(1) a. I 'm not hungry at all.b.
Have you seen my pizza on the table?c.
I'll gel; to sleep.d.
I 'm really satisfied to (',at the pizza.e.
How about another small slice of pizza?Exmnple  2: A mother asked her son to (;lea.it up hismessy room, but he did a slol)py , half-heartedjob.
Alter a while, she discovered that his roomis still messy, and said to her son:(2) 2.
I love children who keep their rooms clean,in(leed.I/.
Would you mind if I asked you to clean upyour room, please?c.
This room may 1)e slightly messy.Example  3: l'eter broke his wife's favorite tea(:ul)when he washed the dishes awkwardly.
I,ookingat the broken cup, his wife said:(3) a.
Thank you fur washing my cup carefully.b.
Thank you for (:rashing my treasure.Example  4: Nancy and Jane were l)lamfing a tripto the beach, but that day was a coht and stormyone.
As she looked out the window, Nancy slid:(4) a.
()It, the weather is really ni(:e.b.
Mayl)e the 1)each is crowded with people.Example  5: Just after his colleague Jesse said tohim "Pd be promoted before you", Peter replied:(5) a.
You'd be promoted before ine, huh7b.
You'd better work harder.Figure 1: Five examples of ironic utterancesplies that violation of pragmatic principh'.s is notan answer to (Q2).
Secondly, it is not  an answer to(Q1) because of its incompetence to discriminateirony from other non-literal utterances (e.g., a lie)in which the.
maxim of quality is tlouted.
Finally,the notion of "the opt)osite of the literal mean-ing" is problematic because it, is aplflicable onlyto declarative assertions hut many ironic utter-ances can take non-declarative forms: questionssuch as (lb); requests uch as (2b); offerings sucha.s (le); and expressives uch as (3a).Other recent theories e.g., mention theory(Wilson and Sperber, 1992) and echoic remindertheory (Kreuz and Ghmksberg, 1989) share acommon view that by mentioning or alluding tosomeone's thought, utterance, expectation or (:nl-tural norm, an ironic utterance communicates aspeaker's att itude toward a discrepancy betweenwhat actually is and what, has heen expected.This view may be essential to irony, but thesetheories ark still incomplete as a comprehensiveframework h)r irony for at least three reasons.First, their concepts of mention/al lusion Sper-her and Wilson's echoic interpretation and Kreuzand Glueksberg's echoic reminder are too nar-row to capture the allusive llattn'e of irony (e.g.,(lb), (le), (41))), and they are not clear enoughto be formalized in a computable fashion, l,brexample, Nancy's utterance (4a) in Fignre 1 ix anechoic interpretation of Nancy's expectation of thefine, weather, bttt (4b) does not interpretively echoany states of affairs: (4b) is an implication derivedfrom the failed expectation.
Second, they implic-itly assume that the properties that characterizeirony can be at)plied to recognition of ironic utter-ances as they stand or they do not focus oil howhearers recoglfize utterances to },)(; ironi(-.
Thilsthey cannot also explain a certain kind of ironi(:utterances in which hearers are not aware of anypragmatic violation.
Finally, these theories pro-vide no plausible explanation of how irony is dis-criminated flom non-ironic echoic utterances.Allusional pretense theory (Kumon-Nakamuraet al, 1995) is the most powerflll one in that it canexplain ironic utterances of five speech act classesusing the two crucial notions of allusion (includ-ing echoic interpretation and reminder) and prag-matic insincerity.
They (:laimed that all ironic ut-terances allude to a failed e, xpe, ctation and vio-late one of the felicity conditions for well-ibrmedspeech acts.
However, allusional pretense the-ory still sut\[ers Dora the same disadvantage asother theories: their notion of allusion is not clearenough, and it does not focus on how hearers rec-Ogllize lltt, eral lt;es t;o be  ironic.3 A un i f ied  theory  o f  i rony3.1 I ron ic  Env i rontnent  and  Its In lp l ic i tDisp layOur unitied theory of irony claims as an mmwer to(Q1) that irony is a figure of Sl)eeeh that inq)lie-itly displays the fact that its utteraime situation issurrounded by ironic environment.
To make this(:lailn realizable, we must explain two importantnotions: ironic eilvironment and implicit display.In order for an utterance to be ironic, a speakernmst utter in a situation sm'rounded by ironic en-vironmeut.
Given two temporal oeatkms to andtt such that to temporally precedes t,, the utter-ante situation where an utterance is given is sur-rounded by ironic, envir(mmcnt if and only if itsatisfies the following three conditions:1.
The speake, r has an expe(:tation E at t~).2.
The speaker's expectation E fails at h .3.
As a result, the speaker has a negative emo-tional att itude toward the incongruity be-tween what is expected and what actually is.Note that our notion of speaker's expectaions sub-sumes cultually expected norms and rules.
Fur-thermore previous theories assume echoic ironylike (5a) to allude to other person's thoughts or963Example  1Instantiated Causal Relations:Sl ~ (< aeecssiltle, x, It )) A (( log, a, It )> A (( eatable, a >) : \[eat(x, a)\] => Su ~ (( hungry, x; 0 }> A (( loc, a, lx >)X Ah,~y,  o >> A (< loe, a, 1,, >> s ,  > << aecessible, > l,.

For example, thespeaker's expectation of (5a) is that Jesse knowshe cannot be promoted betbre Peter.Ironic environment can be classified into the fol-lowing tbur types.?
a speaker's expectation E can be caused byan action A performed by intentional agents- E failed because A failed or cannot t)e per-formed by another action B (type-l)- E failed because A was not performe(t(type-2)?
a speaker's expectation E is not normallycaused by any intentional actionsE failed by an action I3 (type-3)- E accidentally failed (type-4)For example, ironic environment of Example1falls in type-l: Candy's expectation of staying herhunger can be realized by an action of eating apizza, but her husband's action of eating tile wholepizza hindered her expected action.
In the sameway, ironic environments of Examples 2-4 fall intype-2~type-4, respectively, and that of Example 5falls in type-3.An utternace implicitly displays all the threeconditions for ironic environment when it1.
alludes to the speaker's expectation E,2.
includes pragmatic insincerity by intention-ally violating one of pragmatic principles, and3.
implies the speaker's emotional attitude to-ward the failure of E.For example, utterances (2(1) and (2e) tbr Exam-pie 2 are not ironic even when they are given in thesituation surrounded by ironic environment: (2(1)and (2e) directly express the speaker's expectationand tile st)eaker's emotional attitude, rest)ectively,and both do not include pragmatic insincerity.
(2) d. I've expected a clean room.e.
I'm disat)t)ointed with the messy room.On the other hand, all the utterances of Figure 1are ironic because they implicitly express the threecomt)onents of ironic enviromnent, as we will showin Sections a.a-a.s.3.2 Represent ing  I ronic  Env i ronmentIn order to formalize ironic utterances and ironicenviromnent ill a coint)utational fashion, we usesituation theory (Barwise, 1.989) and situation cal-culus.
Our representational scheme includes dis-crete items of intbrmation called infons, s ituationscapable of making infons true (i.e., supt)orting in-fons), and actions.
For example, information thatCandy eats the pizza is represented as the infon(( eat, x, a )> in which x and a denote "Candy" and"the pizza", and its negation as (( ca*,,x,a; 0)).A fact/event hat Candy eats dm pizza is rep-resented as t ~ (( eat, x, a )) where the situationt expresses the spatiotemporal location of thatevent.
Ail action of eating the pizza performedby Candy is expressed by tile predicate at(x,  a)and its negation (i.e., an action of not perfbrm-ing eat (x ,a ) )  by =~;at(x,a).
The state of allah'sthat an action A is perfbrmed is expressed by(( did, A}}.
Also, a proi)osition p expressing theclaim that Candy eats the pizza is written as(t ~ ((eat, x ,a)}) .

\[n many (:ases anironic utterance is praglnatical ly insincere ill thesense that  it intentionally violates one of the pre-conditions in Figure 3 (i.e., sincerity, preparatoryand proposit ional conditions) that  need to holdbefore its i l locutionary act is accomplished, butpragmatic  insincerity also oecurs when an  utter-anee violates other praglnatic l)rineiples.
Re.questsoften I)ecolne il~sincere when they are over-polite,like (2t)) since they violate the t)olitene.ss princi-ple (althougtl (2t)) also becomes insincere whenl,he lnother no hmger intends her son to clean ut)his room).
Understatenmnts like (2c) are also in-sincere since they do not provide as inuch illfor-ulation as re.quired.
The true assertion (2a) vio-lates the princit)le of relevance in that  it does notyie.\]d ally conl;extual implication.
An mentionedearlier, the last three cases have been proi)lenlaticfor all the, previous theories of irony 1)ecause noneof these theories recognized a wide varie, ty of prin-ciples violated by ironic utterances.
Although thist)aper does not describe how these praglnatic t)rin-ciples shouhl l)e formalized, they should be takeninto account for the next steps of our study.965Table 1: Allusion of ironic utterances in Figure 1Conditions for allusion Utterances atisfying the condition1.

for implic-itly communicating their emotional attitude.
Theuse of the interjection "Oh" with a special toneof voice in (4a) offers one typical example of this.Implicit communication can also be accomplishedby utterances explicitly referring to the pleasedemotion that speakers would experience if theirfailed expectation became true.
For example, theutterance (3a) explicitly expresses speaker's coun-terfactual emotion.At the same time, many ironic utterances makeemotion-elieiting rules for the speaker's attitude(some of which are shown in Figure 4) accessibleby the 'hearers by alluding to one of premises ofthe rule.
In the case of (3a), it alludes to Peter'saction of washing the dishes so that the rule for"angry~t" emotion becomes more accessible.3.6 Recognizing and Interpreting IronyIn many cases, all the three components for im-plicit communication of ironic environment areeasily recognized by the hearer.
As we mentionedin Section 2, however, there are also many casessuch as Example 1 that an utterance can be iron-ically interpreted even though all the three com-ponents cannot be recognized by the hearer be-cause the hearer's mental situation differs fromthe speaker's one.
Furthermore, in the case of(5a), after recognizing the utterance to be ironicJesse turns out to know that the speaker Peterthinks Jesse cannot be promoted before Peter.Hence we propose the following condition forrecognizing irony as an answer to (Q2):Hearers can assu Ino  an  ut terance  to  heironic (with high possibility) if they canrecognize that the utterance implicitlydisplays at least two of the three compo-nents for ironic environment, and if theutterance situation does not rule out thepossibility of including tile unrecognizedcomponents, if any}This "2-of-3" criterion makes it possible that hear-ers can recognize utterances as ironic even thoughspeakers do not intend their utterances to be un-derstood as irony.
It, provides empirical evidenceof ()lit' theory since such unintentional irony hasbeen found in a number of psychological experi-ments (Gibbs and O'Brien, 1991).By recognizing an utterance to be ironic, thehearer becomes aware of an illocutionary act ofirony, that of conveying the fact that the utter-ance situation is surrounded by ironic environ-ment (i.e., all the three components for ironic en-vironment hoht in a current situation).
That isan answer to (Q3), and then the hearer inter-prets/understands the ironic utterance by addingthat information to his/her mental situation.
In2Practically speaking, whether an utterance isironic is a matter of degree.
Thus the degree of ironic-ity might t)e a better criterion for recognizing irony.If we can quantitatively evaluate, though do ,tot inthis paper, to what degree an utterance alludes to thespeaker's expectation, towhat degree it includes prag-matic insincerity, and to what degree it implies thespeaker's emotional attitude, we think the proposedcondition for recognizing irony can also be quantita-tively defined.966many cases, sin(:e the hearer already knows thefact that the three components hold in the sit-us\]ion, interpretation of irony results in confir-mation of the mosl; uncertain information, thatis, the speaker's emotional attitude.
However,when the hearer does not recognize all compo-nents, he/she also ol)tains new information thatthe unrecognize.d component holds in a current sit-uation.
Therefore, our the.ory includes many pre-vious theories claiming that irony (:ommunicatesan ironist's emotional attitude.
For example, inthe.
case of (5a), after recognizing Peter's utter-ance (5a) to be iron\](', Jesse turns out to know thatPeter drinks Jesse's t)receding uttermme is absurd,and tries to confirm Peter's emotional attitudeby interpreting (5a) ironically.
Furthermore, aswe mentioned in Section 1, nil ironic utteranceachieves various (:olmnunieation goals held t)y thesl)eaker e.g., to be huinorous, to enq)hasize aI)oint, to clarify as I)erlocutionary acts.4 hnplications of the TheoryDist inct ion  between ironic and non- i ron icut terances :  Our theory ('an disl;inguish iron\]("utterances from non-iron\](; ones.
For exmnple,lies and other non-ironic utt(wances violating thepragmatic principle do not allude to any an-tecedent exi)ectation and/or (lo not offer cues fi)rreasoning about the si)e.aker's emotional attitude.Non-ironic echo\](: utterances do not include prag-matic insincerity and/or do not irnplicitly commu-nicate the speaker's attitude.I ron ic  cues: Some theories assmne that ironycan be identified by special cues tTor irony, but theempirical finding in psychology shows that peoplecan interpret iron\](: statements without any sI)e-cial intonational cues (Gibbs and O'Brien, 1991).Our theory agrees with this finding: such kind ofcues is only a l)art of Component 3 as we describedin Section 3.5, and thus iron\](" ul;teranees withoutthese cues can t)e recognized as ironic.V ic t ims of i rony: Several irony studies, e.g.,(Clark and Gerrig, 1984), have t)ointed out thatirony generally has victims.
Our \[theory suggesl, sth;~t ironic ul;l;eranc('.s have potential vi(:tims whentheir iroific environments fall in one.
of types-l,2,3:in the ease of type-1 or type-3 an agent of 13 I)e-comes a victim, and i,l the case of type-2 an agentof A becomes a victiin.Sarcasm and i rony:  We argue that explicitvictims and disl)lay of the speaker's counterfac-tual pleased emotion described in Section 3.5 m'edist;inctive prop(~rties of sarcasm.
Thus \],he ut-t(,ran(:es (a~) and lab) are sar,:a,~ti(: 1,e,:anse theyhave an ext)licit victim, Peter, and they refer 1;()the wife's comltert'a(:tual l)hmse(t emotion.
\]n par-ti(:ular, an utteran(:e "Thanks a lot!"
for Exam-i)le 3 is non-ironic sar(;asln silt(:(', it does not alludeto any exp(;etation.5 ConclusionIn this paper we have proposed a unified theoryof irony that overcomes several difficulties of pre-vious irony theories.
