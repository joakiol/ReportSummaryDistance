I t  has always ha~ as i t sprime aim a demonst ra t~n of the pract i cab i l i ty  o f  t rans la t ion  bycomputer of  Russian sc ient i f i c  texts  into En@lish.
In  order  totes t  how fa r  th i s  aim has been fu l f i l l ed  and fu r ther ,  to prov ideevidence to 6~i~e a potent ia l  agency in teres te~ in  givin~ a machinet rans la t ion  serv ice ,  we he .car r ied  out an eva luat ion  experimenton our translations, the conditions of which as far as possibleemulated those of a translations service.The resu l t s  of th i s  experiment are presented in th i s  paper ,together  with a statuary of the t rans la t ion  methods used.
Thepaper as a whole will thus give an independent presentation of "whatmethods produced what results".
For a comprehensive account of theNFL translation techniques, see reference I.Evaluation of TranslationsWe have been concerned with the translation of scientificRussian texts only.
In considering how we might evaluate theresults of our work, the context of use of scientific translationsimposed two main constraints.
Thus, firstly, in the vast m~jorityof cases we woul~ expect readers of translations to be themselvesexperts in the subject matter of the material translated, i.e.
theywould be reading the translations because these reflect their mainprofessional responsibilities.
We may then expect that the inherentbackground knowledge of such readers will ensure a hiKh impetus totheir comprehension of translations and help them through syntacticawkwardnesses and multiple-meshing choices.
We would also expectthat only a small peroenta6e of these readers would have anycompetence in Russian.
Secondly, the items of translation beingread by the above typical readers will normally be whole infor.~tionunits (journal article, chapter of book, abstract, review, &c.), andthey will have the freedom to ignore unimportant sections of suchunits an& to use sentence or paragraph context (or even remoterreferences) to help elucidate obscure sections.
More specifically,a particular sentence may be poorly translate~, but because thereader can see that this is not an important sentence or becausethe context of (hopefUlly, better-translated) neighbourin6 sentencesclarifies its meaning, that sentence may not affect at all anadequate comprehension of the whole.Both these const ra in ts  are re f lec ted  in our eva luat ionexperiment.
We ensured that  our eva luators  were expert  in  the- I  -f i e ld  of  the mater ia l  they were eva luat ing ,  and a l so  that  theycommented on the adequacy of an in format ion  uni t  as a whole, noton ind iv idua l  sentences .We have inc luded in  th i s  paper (F I~.

However, the fu l lt rans la t ion  w i l l  be ava i lab le  fo r  inspect ion  a t  the presentat ionof  the paper, or  the fu l l  t rans la t ion  of  another  paper can beexamined in  re ference  1,The eva luat ion  experimentIn  o rder  to  fu l f i l  the f i r s t  const ra in t  above, we inv i tedpract i s ing  sc ient i s ts  to send in  Russian papers ,  re f lec t i~  the i rp ro fess iona l  spec ia l i ty  and pre ferab ly  in  the f ie lds  of genera lphys ics ,  e lec t ron ics ,  or  e lec t r i ca l  eng ineer ing .

3even of these were dis-regarded for various reasonc 2, and the remaining 21 were includedin  the eva luat ion .38 comments were received on 19 of these 21 papers.
Of thesetwo were rejected for vagueness, az~ three brief comments from onegroup were treated as one, so in all the experiment produced 3@comments on 19 papers.1The other  t6 are  accounted fo r  as fo l lows:  I was on a remotesubject; 2 were deferred since we had already translated threepapers for the same 'customer'; @ were withdrawn; 3 weretranslated only in part; and 6 were not reached by the date ourcomputer was sorapped~23 were on inappropr ia te  sub jec ts ;ear l ie r  vers ion  of  the program;fo r  inc lus ion .2 were t rans la ted  only by anand 2 were t rans la ted  too la te-2 -We had decided to give our evaluators a free han~ in dis-cussing the usefulness to them of translations of this quality.This meant that a scale had to be devised by which their commentscould then be graded by us.
A scale recently published in theU.S.A.
(reference 2) was considered but not adopted since we feltthat for our purposes more space should be given to the middlerange of the scale.
The following wording was adopted~Fully adequate.
Meaning immediately clear, even thoughnot always conventionally expressed.Mostly very good.
A few sentences obscure, so that some-thing essential may be lost, but normally clear enough.Fa i r .
Takes a good deal  of t ime to ext rac t  meaning andeven then there  i s  no great  conf idence in  i t ,  resu l t ing  in  apartial understanding.Poor.
Could only be use fu l  to  someone prepared  to s t rugg lehard, and even he would o f ten  be d i sappo inted .Useless.
Although some semblance of meaning may appearoccasionally, it would never be worth the trouble of findingit.The wording of this scale is not derived on ar~ scientific basis,but it has proved useful in practice, since when four of us cameto grade the comments by it independently, there was a good agree-ment between our markings.
Our four individual ratings for eachcomment were reduced to a single rating (normally the mean) afterdiscussion.
The range of scores is shown in FIG.
I ; the meanscore is 5.6.The spread i s  no doubt due to  a rea l  var ia t ion  in  the qua l i tyof the t rans la t ions  combined with the pre jud ices  and degrees ofpatience of the evaluators.
The lowest scores thus come fromimpatient professional translators dealing with a poorer-than-average text, while the highest ones are perhaps over-enthusiasticsupporters dealing with a better-than-average text.The consensus though, is that there is a real demand fortranslations of this quality, and this result provides, we feel,ample justification for mounting a broader evaluation exercise,over a wider range of potential readers of such translations, tostrengthen, if possible, this verdict and make it possible to-3 -FIG.

We are able to commentourselves on some of these points from the pos i t ion  of  havingdone considerable aevelopment work, jus t  short of fu l l  imple-mentation, on techniques designed to overcome the par t i cu la rt rans la t ion  fau l t s .
Yul l  deta i ls  of th i s  fu r ther  work are givenin  reference 1, an& spec i f i c  points of  re ference are given below.Most of these criticisms can be classified into three groups,concerning respectively: (i) the English equivalents offere~(ii) the syntactic resolution and (iii) the wor@ order.A frequent criticism concerned missing or inappropriateequivalents.
In addition to fully justified remarks of thiskind there were also cases in which the meaning proposed, or pre-ferre~ by the rea~er, was uncommon.
Its absence from thedictionary was the result of a preferential choice having beenmade, a compromise between completeness and simplicity.
The otheralternative, including all possible equivalents, would of coursedrastically impair readability.
The particular solution is oftenvery difficult and can only be achieved to a satisfactory degreeafter lon~ experience.In other oases there is no obvious preference an& the problemis further aggravated by the very high frequency of occurrence ofthe word.
Here belong some special classes, for example allprepositions and some very common words such as w , a , an~~ro .
Prepositions can and should be resolved by consideringthem together with either the governin~ word or the governed com-plemsnt (nominal or otherwise)1.
(For example, yBe~T~.
.
~a..,' to increase .... by .... ' ).
For the awkward common wordsspecific syntactic sub-routines should be devised~ in practical~yall cases the solution is unique (see reference ~).Only two evaluators complained about the necess i ty  ofse lec t ion  among two or three equiva lents .
This is a matter ofpreference, but it seems to us that for a bona lids reader anadditional possibility of meaning (if it is not carried too far)is more an asset than a disadvantage, even if it impairs to some1On the l ines  a l ready used for  the reoo~mition of  idioms,expanded to include non-adjacent words; see below in thesummary of  methods.-5 -extent  smooth reading I .
Unt i l  a semantic ana lys is  can beachieved, mult ip le equivalents are bound to stay in  M~.A minor point ,  but  nevertheless worth a t tent ion ,  was to thee f fec t  that  when mult ip le equivalents fol lowed each other ,  thed i f f i cu l ty  in  understanding increased out of  proport ion.
Forexample, c~yqaeTcN nt~ appears as: 'occurs  in  ' when theresu l t s  withactual meaning is often 'results in'.
This was undoubtedly areal problem, which could perhaps be helped by using a longerspace between sets of multiple equivalents in the output.Complaints concerning un-idiomatic translations (e.g.
'periodof work' instead of ' life-time' ) would be allayed by more workspent on our idiom list, which contained only about 5@0 items,whereas 1,500 would be a more realistic figure.Complaints about inadequate syntactic analysis, leadimg toobscurities, ambiguities, and wrong resolutions, would have beenconsiderably reduce& by a full implementation of the syntacticroutines described in reference I.
One of the minor butannoying ambiguities, which ha~ been resolved theoretically, butonly partially implemented, was that of adver~short adjective.Order of clause components was a frequent subject of criticism;of course they can be re-arranged according to the English usageonly after a complete analysis has been made.Among other things criticized was an inadequate treatmentof abbreviations and abbreviated units, some of which were cover@dby dictionary entries, while others were not, and this led to somemisunderstandiu~s.
Obviously this again is a matter for a morecomplete dictionary'.
The most difficult case is "nonce"abbreviations (we met, for instance, He~Tp.
for He~TpO~HN~and produced 'non-itr.
', which helped no one') Here we see noprospect of a solution.Our "anglicizing" routine was criticized (while appreciatingthe general idea) for unorthodox transliteration, which made itmore difficult to identify the word in a standard dictionary, ifnecessary3.
A partial solution may be to exclude certain word1Much can be said on th is  po int .
Readsrs, no aoubt, w i l l  rea l i sehow a ve lvet  smoothness of  t rans la t ion  may hide ready a grievousfault.~ith  a few except ions,  however.
Thus'B'  may be very t roub le -some, as regards the choice between the prepos i t ion  and theabbreviated unit ("volt"), without a special syntactic sub-routine.3This criticism clearly implied some knowle~e of Russian.-6 -c lasses ,  e .g .
acror~ymic abbrev ia t ions ,  which are obv ious ly  notsuitable objects for the routine (they can be automaticallyreoo~xized as clusters of capital letters).
Also, in ourpre f ix - recogn iz ing  rout ine  there  i s  an inherent  &anger that  a"not - in -d ic t ionary"  word may have a par t  of the stem ident ica lwith an accepted pre f ix .
This app l ies  in  par t i cu la r  to  shor tp re f ixes ,  l i ke  He- ,  in  the above example of He~Tp.
.
There i sno genera l  way of  deal ing with such words.
The best  so lu t ion ,in  respect  of  both rout ines ,  seems to be,  however, to  inc lude inthe output both the or ig ina l  ( in  Cyr i l l i c ,  i f  poss ib le )  and thesynthet ic  equ iva lent  fo r  a l l  "not - in -d ic t ionary"  words.A few comments contained bouquets rather than brickbats.One evaluator commented that the translation became easier toread as he got used to the unusual 'style'; and another foundan instance where a slip in the published human translation hadreversed the intended meaning; our version of the passag~whilenot perfect by ar~ means, was certainly not misleading in thisway.F ina l ly ,  severa l  eva luators  commented that  machine t rans -la t ions  would need to show advantages in  cost  and speed overhuman t rans la t ions  in  o rder  fo r  them to be a t t rac t ive  as wel l  asacceptab le ,  and these  are indeed c r i te r ia  that  we would ourse lvesput forward without  fear  of  cont rad ic t ion .
V~e have not inc ludeda s tuds  of cos t  and speed w i th in  th i s  eva luat ion  experiment,  aswe do not have the market data  to prepare a t rans la t ion  serv icespec i f i ca t ion  that  we could then re fer  such a study to .

Each entry containsgrammatical ~ata and English equivalents of the Rus~ian~The stem and suffix organisation ~eman&e~ that we create asystem of splitting Russian words consistently into stem an~suffix, fully dssoribed in Davies & Day, (1961).
The split ismade at the point determined by the maximum number of letterswhich together form a Russian suffix or string of suffixes.The maximum split technique sometimes causes too mar~ lettersto be treated as part of the suffix, in other words, the splitis made too early in the worm.
Such words are provided with acress-reference dictionary entry which directs the search to anentry in which the full information for the word is contained~The dictionary is recorded on two reels of ma6netio tape,theentries being arra~6e& in alphabetical ordsr.
Time ofconsultation of the full d/otionary is from 12 minutes upwards,depending on the number of entries being sought.A text  fo r  t rans la t ion  is  f i r s t  punched on cards by anoperator  who reco~mizes Cyr i l l i c  characters ,  though she cannotread Russian.
Symbols, punctuation marks and Cyr i l l i ccharacters  are represented by one card column per character .Provision is made for indloatin 6. a space to be lef~ in the textwhere an equation or group of symbols occurs.
These will beinserted in the translation by han~.
The cards are treated asa continuous medium, card boundaries being ignored,.
By thismeans quite a long paper can he encoded on a relatively smallnumber of punohed cards.The text ,  now on cards,  is  fed into the computer.
Thef i r s t  computing process gives a ser ia l  number to each text  wordand then sp l i t s  the word into stem and su f f i x .
When a l l  textwords have been subjected to th is  process,  they are then sor tedin to  a lphabet ica l  order.
This is  essent ia l  fo r  optimum speedof  look-up in our ser ia l l y  organised d ic t ionary .The next programme in the t rans la t ion  sequence, the look -up programme, scans s imultaneously through the d ic t ionary  andthe sorted text ,  seeking d ic t ionary  ent r ies  corresponding to thetext  words.
The programme allows fo r  the occurrence of stemhomographs and for  the cor rec t  handling of c ross - re ferenceent r ies .
The output of the programme (which we ca l l ,  fo l lowingHarvard, the augmented text )  cons is ts  of the text  words eachwith the relevant dictionary entries appended.Having obtained a set of augmented text entries, thetranslation sequence then sorts these back to text order, usingthe text serial number originally allocated to each text wor~- t0  -The result of this series of operations is a text in theoriginal ordsrj with dictionary entries appended to all but afew of the items.
Symbols and punctuation marks do not, ofcourse, have corresponding d ic t ionary  ent r ies ,  and there maybe words in the text  which are not represented in  the computerd ic t ionary .
The la t te r  are given specia l  treatment in thesyntact i c  rout ines and t rans la t ion  output.Provision is made in the dictionary for the representationof idioms, using a m~thod analogous to that used in an ord inaryd ic t ionary .
A "key word" is  chosen in the idiom (normally theleast frequently occurrin6 wor~), the idiom being representedin the dictionary entry of the key word.
The representationincludes a list of the component words of the idiom, using whichthe presence of an id iomatic text  word sequence can be detectedbefore attemptin~ any syntact ic  operat ions on the augmented text .The d ic t ionary  entry  including the idiom contains the pre fer redEngl ish equiva lent .
The d ic t ionary  includes coding fo r  5A0idioms.Words not represented in the d ic t ionary  are given spec ia lt reatment,  as mentioned above.
Al l  tex t  words which commencewith one of  a set of 137 Russian pref ixes  are looked up bothwith and without p re f ix .
I f  the pref ixed form does not occurin  the d /ct ionar~,  but the unpref ixed form is  found, then theentry  fo r  the uupref ixed form is included in the augmented text ,coupled with an En61ish rendering of the Russian prefix.
Despitethis provision, some text words will not intersect with thed ic t ionary .
For these an attempt is  made to determine part  ofspeech, case, number, e tc .

In  the t rans la t ion  output the stem ofthe not - in -d ic t ionary  word is t rans l i te ra ted ,  aJuain6 to ang l i c i zeas far as possible the original word.
A derivations/ suffixis given its English equivalent in the output rendering; anyprefix that was recognised is also given its English rendering.Yrom an augmented text  produced by the foregoing proceduresi t  would be a simple mechanical process to achieve a word- for -word " t rans la t ion" .

The fourth pass, however,seeks to join to existing noun groups any other nouns linke~by coordinat~ conjunctions:-Beauuz .... ~ g "qepHN~nx$pauw ~ C&HO~888HHKecTa - ~ -NO,sanxcx__ _rpaswn._In addition the pass groups together in coordinate groups anysimilar words joined by coordinating conjunctions, whatever theirpart of speech.
Intervening punctuation prevents the formationof coordinate groups.
The coordinate group, when formed, isgiven the grammatical significance of its component parts.- 15  -The f i f th  analys is  pass has l i t t le  e f feot  on our samplesentence.

(No instances occurin the sample sentence).
For example, if one of the ambiguouspersons/ /possess ive pronouns is  encounterea, ~ check is made tosee whether the fo l lowing sentence element is  nominal.

I f  i ti s ,  then the pronoun is  jo ined in  the element as a modifier~ andthe pronoun is treated as possessive.

iH~wing completed the sixth pass, no further analysis of theRussian sentence is  undertaken.
The se~tenee s t ruc ture-16  -delineate& by the analysis passes is not complete, since noattempt is made to set up a clause strusture.
