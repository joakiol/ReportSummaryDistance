A Practical Nonmonotonic Theoryfor Reasoning about Speech ActsDouglas Appel t ,  Kur t  Konol igeArtif icial Intel l igence Center  andCenter  for the S tudy  of Language and In format ionSRI  In ternat iona lMenlo  Park,  Cal i forniaAbstractA prerequisite to a theory of the way agents un-derstand speech acts is a theory of how their be-liefs and intentions are revised as a consequenceof events.
This process of attitude revision isan interesting domain for the application of non-monotonic reasoning because speech acts have aconventional aspect that is readily represented bydefaults, but that interacts with an agent's be-liefs and intentions in many complex ways thatmay override the defaults.
Perrault has devel-oped a theory of speech acts, based on Rieter'sdefault logic, that captures the conventional as-pect; it does not, however, adequately account forcertain easily observed facts about attitude revi-sion resulting from speech acts.
A natural the-ory of attitude revision seems to require a methodof stating preferences among competing defaults.We present here a speech act theory, formalizedin hierarchic autoepistemic logic (a refinement ofMoore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision ofboth the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can beadequately described.
As a collateral benefit, effi-cient automatic reasoning methods for the formal-ism exist.
The theory has been implemented andis now being employed by an utterance-planningsystem.1 IntroductionThe general idea of utterance planning has beenat the focus of much NL processing research forthe last ten years.
The central thesis of this170approach is that utterances are actions that areplanned to satisfy particular speaker goals.
Thishas led researchers to formalize speech acts in away that would permit them to be used as op-erators in a planning system \[1,2\].
The centralproblem in formalizing speech acts is to correctlycapture the pertinent facts about the revision ofthe speaker's and hearer's attitudes that ensuesas a consequence of the act.
This turns out to bequite difficult bemuse the results of the attituderevision are highly conditional upon the context ofthe utterance.To consider just a small number of the contin-gencies that may arise, consider a speaker S utter-ing a declarative sentence with propositional con-tent P to hearer H. One is inclined to say that,if H believes S is sincere, H will believe P. How-ever, if H believes -~P initially, he may not beconvinced, even if he thinks S is sincere.
On theother hand, he may change his beliefs, or he maysuspend belief as to whether P is true.
H maynot believe --P, but simply believe that S is neitercompetent nor sincere, and so may not come tobelieve P. The problem one is then faced withis this: How does one describe the effect of ut-tering the declarative sentence so that given theappropriate contextual elements, any one of thesepossibilities can follow from the description?One possible approach to this problem would beto find some fundamental, context-independent f-fect of informing that is true every time a declara-tive sentence is uttered.
If one's general theory ofthe world and of rational behavior were sufficientlystrong and detailed, any of the consequences ofattitude revision would be derivable from the ba-sic effect in combination with the elaborate theoryof rationality.
The initial efforts made along thispath \[3,5\] entailed the axiomatization the effectsof speech acts as producing in the hearer the be-lief that the speaker wants him to recognize thelatter's intention to hold some other belief.
Theeffects were characterized by nestings of Goal andBel operators, as inBel(H, Goal(S, Bel(H, P))).If the right conditions for attitude revision ob-tained, the conclusion BeI(H,P) would followfrom the above assumption.This general approach proved inadequate be-cause there is in fact no such statement about b.e-liefs about goals about beliefs that is true in everyperformance of a speech act.
It is possible to con-struct a counterexample contradicting any such ef-fect that might be postulated.
In addition, longand complicated chains of reasoning are requiredto derive the simplest, most basic consequences ofan utterance in situations in which all of the "nor-real" conditions obtain - -  a consequence that runscounter to one's intuitive expectations.Cohen and Levesque \[4\] developed a speech acttheory in a monotonic modal logic that incorpo-rates context-dependent preconditions in the ax-ioms that state the effects of a speech act.
Theirapproach overcomes the theoretical difficulties ofearlier context-independent at empts; however, ifone desires to apply their theory in a practicalcomputational system for reasoning about speechacts, one is faced with serious difficulties.
Someof the context-dependent conditions that deter-mine the effects of a speech act, according to theirtheory, involve statements about what an agentdoes no~ believe, as well as what he does believe.This means that for conclusions about the effect ofspeech acts to follow from the theory, it must in-clude an explicit representation f an agent's igno-rance as well as of his knowledge, which in practiceis difficult or even impossible to achieve.A further complication arises from the type ofreasoning necessary for adequate characterizationof the attitude revision process.
A theory based onmonotonic reasoning can only distinguish betweenbelief and lack thereof, whereas one based on non-monotonic reasoning can distinguish between be-171lief (or its absence) as a consequence of knownfacts, and belief that follows as a default becausemore specific information is absent.
To the extentthat such a distinction plays a role in the attituderevision process, it argues for a formalization witha nonmonotonic character.Our research is therefore motivated by the fol-lowing observations: (1) earlier work demonstratesconvincingly that any adequate speech-act theorymust relate the effects of a speech act to context-dependent preconditions; (2) these preconditionsmust depend on the ignorance as well as on theknowledge of the relevant agents; (3 )any  prac-tical system for reasoning about ignorance mustbe based on nonmonotonic reasoning; (4) existingspeech act theories based on nonmonotonic rea-soning cannot account for the facts of attitude re-vision resulting from the performance of speechacts.2 Perrault's Default Theoryof Speech ActsAs an alternative to monotonic theories, Perraulthas proposed a theory of speech acts, based on anextension of Reiter's default logic \[11\] extendedto include-defanlt-rule schemata.
We shall sum-marize Perrault's theory briefly as it relates to in-forming and belief.
The notation p =~ q is intendedas an abbreviation of the default rule of inference,p:MqqDefault theories of this form are called normal.Every normal default theory has at least one ex-tension, i.e., a mutually consistent set of sentencessanctioned by the theory.The operator Bz,t represents Agent z's beliefs attime t and is assumed to posess all the propertiesof the modal system weak $5 (that is, $5 withoutthe schema Bz,t~ D ~b), plus the following axioms:Persistence:B~,t+IB~,~P D B~,~+IPMemory:(1)B~,~P D B~,t+IB~,~P (2)Observability:Do~,,a ^ D%,,(Obs(Do~,,(a)))B.,,+lDo.,,(a)Belief Transfer:(3)B~,tBy,~P =~ B,,tP (4)Declarative:Do~,t(Utter(P)) =~ Bz,,P (5)In addition, there is a default-rule schema stat-ing that, if p =~ q is a default rule, then so isB~,~p =~ Bx,tq for any agent z and time t.Perrault could demonstrate hat, given his the-ory, there is an extension containing all of thedesired conclusions regarding the beliefs of thespeaker and hearer, starting from the fact thata speaker utters a declarative sentence and thehearer observes him uttering it.
Furthermore, thetheory can make correct predictions in cases inwhich the usual preconditions of the speech actdo not obtain.
For example, if the speaker is ly-ing, but the hearer does not recognize the lie, thenthe heater's beliefs are exactly the same as whenthe speaker tells the truth; moreover the speaker'sbeliefs about mutual belief are the same, but hestill does not believe the proposition he uttered mthat is, he fails to be convinced by his own lie.3 Prob lems w i th  Perrault 'sTheoryA serious problem arises with Perrault's theoryconcerning reasoning about an agent's ignorance.His theory predicts that a speaker can convincehimself of any unsupported proposition simply byasserting it, which is clearly at odds with our in-tuitions.
Suppose that it is true of speaker s that~Bs,tP.
Suppose furthermore that, for whateverreason, s utters P. In the absence of any furtherinformation about the speaker's and hearer's be-liefs, it is a consequence of axioms (1)-(5) thatBs,~+IBh,~+IP.
From this consequence and thebelief transfer rule (4) it is possible to concludeB,,~+IP.
The strongest conclusion that can bederived about s's beliefs at t + 1 without using172this default rule is B,,t+I"~B,,~P, which is not suf-ficient to override the default.This problem does not admit of any simple fixes.One clearly does not want an axiom or default ruleof the form that asserts what amounts to "igno-rance persists" to defeat conclusions drawn fromspeech acts.
In that case, one could never con-clude that anyone ever learns anything as a resultof a speech act.
The alternative is to weaken theconditions under which the default rules can bedefeated.
However, by adopting this strategy weare giving up the advantage of using normal de-faults.
In general, nonnormal default theories donot necessarily have extensions, nor is there anyproof procedure for such logics.Perrault has intentionally left open the questionof how a speech act theory should be integratedwith a general theory of action and belief revision.He finesses this problem by introducing the per-sistence axiom, which states that beliefs alwayspersist across changes in state.
Clearly this is nottrue in general, because actions typically changeour beliefs about what is true of the world.
Evenif one considers only speech acts, in some cases ?one can get an agent to change his beliefs by say-ing something, and in other cases not.
Whetherone can or not, however, depends on what be-lief revision strategy is adopted by the respectiveagents in a given situation.
The problem cannotbe solved by simply adding a few more axiomsand default rules to the theory.
Any theory thatallows for the possibility of describing belief revi-sion must of necessity confront he problem of in-consistent extensions.
This means that, if a hearerinitially believes -~p, the default theory will have(at least) one extension for the case in which hisbelief that -~p persists, and one extension in whichhe changes his mind and believes p. Perhaps itwill even have an extension in which he suspendsbelief as to whether p.The source of the difficulties urrounding Per-ranlt's theory is that the default logic h e adoptsis unable to describe the attitude revision that oc-curs in consequence of a speech act.
It is not ourpurpose here to state what an agent's belief re-vision strategy should be.
Rather we introduce aframework within which a variety of belief revisionstrategies can be accomodated efficiently, and wedemonstrate hat this framework can be applied ina way that eliminates the problems with Perranlt'stheory.Finally, there is a serious practical problemfaced by anyone who wishes to implement Per-fault's theory in a system that reasons aboutspeech acts.
There is no way the belief transferrule can be used efficiently by a reasoning sys-tem; even if it is assumed that its application isrestricted to the speaker and hearer, with no otheragents in the domain involved.
If it is used in abackward irection, it applies to its own result.
In-voking the rule in a forward direction is also prob-lematic, because in general one agent will have avery large number of beliefs (even an infinite num-ber, if introspection is taken into account) aboutanother agent's beliefs, most of which will be ir-relevant o the problem at hand.4 Hierarchic AutoepistemicLogicAutoepistemic (AE) logic was developed by Moore\[I0\] as a reconstruction of McDermott's nonmono-tonic logic \[9\].
An autoepistemic logic is based ona first-order language augmented by a modal op-erator L, which is interpreted intuitively as selfbelief.
A stable zpansio, (analogous to an exten-sion of a default theory) of an autoepistemic baseset A is a set of formulas T satisfying the followingconditions:1.
T contains all the sentences of the base the-ory A2.
T is closed under first-order consequence3.
If ~b E T, then L~b E T4.
If ?
~ T, then --L~b 6 THierarchic autoepistemic logic (HAEL) was de-veloped in response to two deficiences of autoepis-temic logic, when the latter is viewed as a logicfor automated nonmonotonic reasoning.
The firstis a representational problem: how to incorporatepreferences among default inferences in a naturalway within the logic.
Such preferences arise inmany disparate settings in nonmonotonic reason-ing - -  for example, in taxonomic hierarchies \[6\]or in reasoning about events over time \[12\].
Tosome extent, preferences among defaults can be173encoded in AE logic by introducing auxiliary in-formation into the statements of the defaults, butthis method does not always accord satisfactorilywith our intuitions.
The most natural statementof preferences i with respect o the multiple ex-pansions of a particular base set, that is, we pre-fer certain expansions because the defaults used inthem have a higher priority than the ones used inalternative xpansions.The second problem is computational: how totell whether a proposition is contained within thedesired expansion of a base set.
As can be seenfrom the above definition, a stable expansion ofan autoepistemic theory is defined as a fixedpoint;the question of whether a formula belongs to thisfixedpoint is not even semidecidable.
This prob-lem is shared by all of the most popular nonmono-tonic logics.
The usual recourse is to restrict theexpressive power of the language, e.g., normal de-fault theories \[11\] and separable circumscriptivetheories \[8\].
However, as exemplified by the diffi-culties of Perrault's approach, it may not be easyor even possible to express the relevant facts witha restricted language.Hierarchical autoepistemic logic is a modifica-tion of autoepistemic logic that addresses thesetwo considerations.
In HAEL, the primary struc-ture is not a single uniform theory, but a collectionof subtheories linked in a hierarchy.
Snbtheoriesrepresent different sources of information availableto an agent, while the hierarchy expresses the wayin which this information is combined.
For ex-ample, in representing taxonomic defaults, morespecific information would take precedence overgeneral attributes.
HAEL thus permits a naturalexpression of preferences among defaults.
Further-more, given the hierarchical nature of the subthe-ory relation, it is possible to give a constructivesemantics for the autoepistemic operator, in con-trast to the usual self-referential fixedpoints.
Wecan then arrive easily at computational realiza-tions of the logic.The language of HAEL consists of a standardfirst-order language, augmented by a indexed setof unary modal operators Li.
If ~b is any sentence(containing no free variables) of the first-order lan-guage, then L~ is also a sentence.
Note that nei-ther nesting of modal operators nor quantifyinginto a modal context is allowed.
Sentences with-out modal operators are called ordinary.An HAEL structure r consists of an indexedset of subtheories rl, together with a partial orderon the set.
We write r~ -< rj if r~ precedes rj inthe order.
Associated with every subtheory rl is abase set Ai, the initial sentences of the structure.Within A~, the occurrence of Lj is restricted bythe following condition:If Lj occurs positively (negatively) in (6)Ai, then rj _ r~ (rj -< ri).This restriction prevents the modal operator fromreferring to subtheories that succeed it in the hier-archy, since Lj~b is intended to mean that ~b is anelement of the subtheory rj.
The distinction be-tween positive and negative occurrences i simplythat a subtheory may represent (using L) whichsentences it contains, but is forbidden from repre-senting what it does not contain.A complez stable e~pansion f an HAEL struc-ture r is a set of sets of sentences 2~ correspondingto the subtheories of r. It obeys the following con-ditions (~b is an ordinary sentence):1.
Each T~ contains Ai2.
Each Ti is closed under first-order conse-quence3.
If eE l ,  and ~'j ~ rl, then Lj~b E~4.
If ?
~ ~,  and rj -< rl, then -,Lj ~b E5.
If ~ E Tj, and rj -< vi, then ~bE~.These conditions are similar to those for AE sta-ble expansions.
Note that, in (3) and (4), 2~ con-tains modal atoms describing the contents of sub-theories beneath it in the hierarchy.
In addition,according to (5) it also inherits all the ordinarysentences of preceeding subtheories.Unlike AE base sets, which may have morethan one stable expansion, HAEL structures havea unique minimal complex stable expansion (seeKonolige \[7\]).
So we are justified in speaking of"the" theory of an HAEL structure and, from thispoint on, we shall identify the subtheory r~ of astructure with the set of sentences in the complexstable expansion for that subtheory.Here is a simple example, which can be inter-preted as the standard "typically birds fly" defaulti74scenario by letting F(z) be "z flies," B(z) be "zis a bird," and P(z) be "z is a penguin.
"Ao -- {P(a), B(a)}AI - {LIP(a) A",LoF(a) D -,F(a)}A2 -" {L2B(a) A ",LI-,F(a) D F(a)}(7)Theory r0 contains all of the first-order con-sequences of P(a), B(a), LoP(a), and LoB(a).-~LoF(a) is not in r0, hut it is in rl, as is LoP(a),-LooP(a), etc.
Note that P(a) is inherited byrl; hence L1P(a) is in rl.
Given this, by first-order closure ",F(a) is in rl and, by inheritance,LI",F(a) is in r2, so that F(a) cannot be derivedthere.
On the other hand, r2 inherits ",F(a) fromrl.Note from this example that informationpresent in the lowest subtheories of the hierarchypercolates to its top.
More specific evidence, orpreferred efaults, should be placed lower in thehierarchy, so that their effects will block the actionof higher-placed evidence or defaults.HAEL can be given a constructive semanticsthat is in accord with the closure conditions.W'hen the inference procedure of each subtheoryis decidable, an obvious decidable proof methodfor the logic exists.
The details of this develop-ment are too complicated to be included here, butare described by Konolige \[7\].
For the rest of thispaper, we shall use a propositional base language;the derivations can be readily checked.5 A HAEL Theory of SpeechActsWe demonstrate here how to construct a hierarchicautoepistemic theory of speech acts.
We assumethat there is a hierarchy of autoepisternic subthe-ories as illustrated in Figure i.
The lowest subthe-ory, ~'0, contains the strongest evidence about thespeaker's and hearer's mental states.
For exam-ple, if it is known to the hearer that the speakeris lying, this information goes into r0.In subtheory vl, defaults are collected about theeffects of the speech act on the beliefs of bothhearer and speaker.
These defaults can be over-ridden by the particular evidence of r0.
Togetherr0 and rl constitute the first level of reasoningabout the speech act.
At Level 2, the beliefs ofthe speaker and hearer that can be deduced inrl are used as evidence to guide defaults aboutnested beliefs, that is, the speaker's beliefs aboutthe heater's beliefs, and vice versa.
These resultsare collected in r2.
In a similar manner, successivelevels contain the result of one agent's reflectionupon his and his interlocutor's beliefs and inten-tions at the next lower level.
We shall discuss herehow Levels r0 and rl of the HAEL theory are ax-iomatized, and shall extend the axiomatization tothe higher theories by means of axiom schemata.An agent's belief revision strategy is representedby two features of the model.
The position ofthe speech act theory in the general hierarchy oftheories determines the way in which conclusionsdrawn in those theories can defeat conclusions thatfollow from speech acts.
In our model, the speechact defaults will go into the subtheory rl, whileevidence that will be used to defeat hese defaultswill go in r0.
In addition, the axioms that relaterl to r0 determine precisely what each agent iswilling to accept from 1"0 as evidence against hedefault conclusions of the speech act theory.It is easy to duplicate the details of Perrault'sanalysis within this framework.
Theory r0 wouldcontain all the agents' beliefs prior to the speechact, while the defaults of rl would state that anagent believed the utterance P if he did not be-lieve its negation in r0.
As we have noted, thisanalysis does not allow for the situation in whichthe speaker utters P without believing either itor its opposite, and then becomes convinced of itstruth by the very fact of having uttered it m nordoes it allow the hearer to change his belief in -~Pas a result of the utterance.We choose a more complicated and realistic ex-pression of belief revision.
Specifically, we allowan agent to believe P (in rl) by virtue of the ut-terance of P only if he does not have any evidence(in r0) against believing it.
Using this scheme,we can accommodate he hearer's change of be-lief, and show that the speaker is not convincedby his own efforts.We now present he axioms of the HAEL theoryfor the declarative utterance of the proposition P.The language we use is a propositional modal one175for the beliefs of the speaker and hearer.
Agents sand h represent the speaker and hearer; the sub-scripts i and f represent the initial situation andthe situation resulting from the utterance, respec-tively.
There are two operators: \[a\] for a's beliefand {a} for a's goals.
The formula \[hI\]c~, for exam-ple, means that the hearer believes ~b in the finalsituation, while {si}?
means that the speaker in-tended ~b in the initial situation.
In addition, weuse a phantom agent u to represent the content ofthe utterance and certain assumptions about thespeaker's intentions.
We do not argue here as towhat constitutes the correct logic of these opera-tors; a convenient one is weak $5.The following axioms are assumed to hold in allsubtheories.\[u\]P, P the propositional content of ut- (8)terance\[~\]?
D \[~\]{s~}\[hA?
(9)\[a\]{a}?
~.
{a}?, where a is any (10)agent in any sit-uat ion .The contents of the u theory are essentially thesame for all types of speech acts.
The precise ef-fects upon the speaker's and heater's mental statesis determined by the propositional content of theutterance and its mood.
We assume here that thespeaker utters, a simple declarative sentence, (Ax-iom 8), although a similar analysis could be donefor other types of sentences, given a suitable repre-sentation of their propositional content.
Proposi-tions that are true in u generally become believedby the speaker and hearer in rl, provided thatthese propositions bear the proper relationship totheir beliefs in r0.
Finally, the speaker in$ends tobring about each of the beliefs the hearer acquiresin rl, also subject o the caveat hat it is consistentwith his beliefs in to.Relation between subtheories:ro -~ n (11)Speaker's beliefs as a consequence of the speechact:in AI: \[u\]?

The intuition behind these axioms is thata speech act should never change the speaker'smental attitudes with regard to the propositionhe utters.
If he utters a sentence, regardless ofwhether he is lying, or in any other way insincere,he should believe P after the utterance if and onlyif he believed it before.
However, in the bearer'scase, whether he believes P depends not only onhis prior mental state with respect o P, but alsoon whether he believes that the speaker is beingsincere.
~ iom 13 states that a hearer is willing tobelieve what a speaker says if it does not conflictwith his own beliefs in ~,  and if the utterance doesnot conflict with what the hearer believes aboutthe speaker's mental state, (i.e., that the speakeris not lying), and if he believes that believing Pis consistent with his beliefs about the speaker'sprior intentions (i.e., that the speaker is using theutterance with communicative intent, as distinctfrom, say, testing a microphone).As a first example of the use of the theory, con-sider the normal case in which A0 contains no evi-dence about the speaker's and bearer's beliefs afterthe speech act.
In this event, A0 is empty and A1contains Axioms 8-1b.
By the inheritance condi-tions, 1"1 contains -~L0-,\[sl\]P , and so must contain\[s/\]P by axiom 12.
Similarly, from Axiom 13 it fol-lows that \[h/\]P is in rl.
Further derivations leadto {sl}\[hl\]P , {si}\[hl\]{si}\[hy\]P , and so on.As a second example, consider the case in whichthe speaker utters P, perhaps to convince thehearer of it, but does not himself believe eitherP or its negation.
In this case, 1"0 contains -~\[sf\]Pand -~\[sl\]-~P , and ~'1 must contain Louis tiP bythe inheritance condition.
Hence, the applicationof Axiom 12 will be blocked, and so we cannotconclude in ~'1 that the speaker believes P. Onthe other hand, since none of the antecedents ofAxiom 13 are affected, the hearer does come tobelieve it.Finally, consider belief revision on the part ofthe hearer.
The precise path belief revision takesdepends on the contents of r0.
If we consider thehearer's belief to be stronger evidence than that ofthe utterance, we would transfer the heater's ini-tial belief \[hl\]~P to \[h/\]'-,P in ~'0, and block the de-fault Axiom 13.
But suppose the hearer does notbelieve --P strongly in the initial situation.
Then176we would transfer (by default) the belief \[h\]\]~Pto a subtheory higher than rl, since the evidencefurnished by the utterance ismeant o override theinitial beliefi Thus, by making the proper choicesregarding the transfer of initial beliefs in varioussubtheories, it becomes possible to represent, therevision of the hearer's beliefs.This theory of speech acts has been presentedwith respect o declarative sentences and repre-sentative speech acts.
To analyze imperative sen-tences and directive speech acts, it is clear inwhat direction one should proceed, although therequired augmentation to the theory is quite com-plex.
The change in the utterance theory that isbrought about by an imperative sentence is theaddition of the belief that the speaker intends thehearer to bring about the propositional content ofthe utterance.
That would entail substituting thefollowing effect for that stated by Axiom 8:\[u\]{s/}P, P the propositional con- (14)tent of utteranceOne then needs to axiomatize a theory of intentionrevision as well as belief revision, which entails de-scribing how agents adopt and abandon intentions,and how these intentions are related to their be-liefs about one another.
Cohen and Levesque haveadvanced an excellent proposal for such a theory\[4\], but any discussion of it is far beyond the scopeof this article.6 Reflecting on the TheoryWhen agents perform speech acts, not only aretheir beliefs about the uttered proposition af-fected, but also their beliefs about one another,to arbitrayr levels of reflection.If a speaker reflects on what a hearer believesabout the speaker's own beliefs, he takes into ac-count not only the beliefs themselves, but alsowhat he believes to be the hearer's belief revi-sion strategy, which, according to our theory, isreflected in the hierarchical relationship among thetheories.
Therefore, reflection on the speech-act-understanding process takes place at higher levelsof the hierarchy illustrated in Figure 1.
For exam-ple, if Level 1 represents the speaker's reasoningabout what the hearer believes, then Level 2 rep-177resents the speaker's reasoning about the heater'sbeliefs about what the speaker' believes.In general, agents may have quite complicatedtheories about how other agents apply defaults.The simplest assumption we can make is that theyreason in a uniform manner, exactly the same asthe way we axiomatized Level 1.
Therefore, we ex-tend the analysis just presented to arbitrary reflec-tion of agents on one another's belief by proposingaxiom schemata for the speaker's and heater's be-liefs at each level, of which Axioms 12 and 13 arethe Level 1 instances.
We introduce a schematicoperator \[(s, h)n\] which can be thought of as n lev-els of alternation of s's and h's beliefs about eachother.
This is stated more precisely as\[(8, h),,\]?
(is)n timesThen, for example, Axiom 12 can be restated asthe general schemain An+l :(\[,\]~ ^ (16)"L.\[(hl, 8I).\]'\[8j\]~)\[(hi, 81),\] \[81\]~.7 ConclusionA theory of speech acts based on default reasoningis elegant and desirable.
Unfortunately, the onlyexisting proposal that explains how this should bedone suffers from three serious pioblems: (1) thetheory makes some incorrect predictions; (2) thetheory cannot be integrated easily with a theoryof action; (3) there seems to be no efficient imple-mentation strategy.
The problems are stem fromthe theory's formulation in normal default logic.We have demonstrated how these difficulties canbe overcome by formulating the theory instead ina version of autoepistemic logic that is designed tocombine reasoning about belief with autoepistemicreasoning.
Such a logic makes it possible to for-realize a description of the agents' belief revisionprocesses that can capture observed facts aboutattitude revision correctly in response to speechacts.
This theory has been tested and imple-mented as a central component of the GENESYSutterance-planning system.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in part by a contractwith the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Cor-poration, in part by the Office of Naval Researchunder Contract N00014-85-C-0251, and in partunder subcontract with Stanford University un-der Contract N00039-84-C-0211 with the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency.
