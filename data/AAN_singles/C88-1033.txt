Partial Orderings and Aktionsarten in Discourse Representation TheorylOtrt EBERLEInstitut for Maschinelle SpraehverarbeitungUniversit~it StuttgartKeplerstr.177000 StuttgartWest GermanyAbstractThis paper presents an approach to deal with the underspecification ofAktionsarten i German sentences.
In German the difference between anaccomplishment and the associated progressive state is often not markedon the sentence level.
This distinction is important for correctlyinterpreting texts and for translation into languages which providemorphological markings of Aktionsarten.
To maintain compositionality wesuggest a two-step analysis of a text with respect o the temporal relationsand the classification as events or states.
This analysis is guided by theDiscourse Representation Theory developed by Kamp and makes use ofworld knowledge and an inference component.The problem of classification can be reformulated as the problem offinding an embedding function f from the representational entities ontothe domain of a model.
The models we use are structures built fromintervals of time, events and individuals.
Considering intensional models ofthis type will allow us to give truth-conditions for progressive states relatedto corresponding accomplishments.
We restrict ourselves to progressivestates of intentional actions and use the beliefs of the agent.1) Introduction:The influence of the criterion "Aktionsart" with respect o the temporalrelations of temporal entities often seems to be overemphasized.
On theone hand the correct dassiftcation is a problem, on the other hand, itseems that in more cases than assumed the influence of world knowledgeis necessary to disambiguate he temporal relations.In this paper an approach is preseuted based on a two-step anal~Ls of atext.
The first step consists in constructing a partial ordering on the basisof an approximate classification of the temporal units on sentence level,using the framework of D(iscourse) R(epresentatlon) T(heory)/cf.Kamp1981a/.
In the second step we try to obtain possible linear readings, usingbackground-information, provided by a database, and an inferencecomponent that.
is an extended version of the "event-calculus"/cf.Kowalski,Sergot/.The subdivision into two steps enables the temporal resolutioncomponent to work without a great number of inferencing processes.
Thiscontributes to a more modular-like structuring of the natural anguageprocessing-system.
The goal is to represent ambiguous readings as such.The progressive state reading of an accomplishment leads to the problemcalled "imperfeetive paradox".
Using the beliefs of the agent we try to givea solution for the subclass of intentional actions.
The problem here is todeal with the time dependency of the content of someone's belief.1602) Partial Event-StructuresThe starting point of this paper is the conviction, following Kamp andothers, that within the temporal units, events are primordial, and time isabstracted from them.
The construction of pure temporal units can bebased on the ultra-filter-construction ntroduced by Wiener /cf.Kamp1979,1981b,van Benthem/: In order to model the naturalunderspecification f human perception, only the relations < , o(temporally smaller or overlap) are given within the event-structures in/Kamp 1979/along with the following axioms:A1 V el,e 2 e I < c 2 - > ~ e 2 < e 1A2 Vel,e 2 e 1 <e 2 & e 2< e 3 -> e I < e 3A3 Vel,e 2 e lee  2 -> e 2oe  1A4 V e 1 e I o e 1A5 Vel,e 2 e I <e  2 -~.
~e lee  2A6 Vel,e2,e3,e 4 e l<  e 2 & e 2oe  3 & e 3< e 4 -> e 1 < e 4Including the axiom of linearityA7 Vel,e 2 e l<  e 2 ; e lee  2 ; e 2< e Iother relations llke "subset" or "temporal equivalence" can be defined outof these basic relations.
This shows the fundamental significance of therelations < and o.The addition of new events can allow a more accurate statement o~ thetemporal relations.
If we start with an uttered relation o f  vaguesimultaneity between two events e I and e 2 expressed by e 1 o % and if itbecomes clear from later passages of the text that there are events e 3 ande 4 with e 3 < e 2 < e 4 and e 3 o e 1 and e 4 o e 1 we can deduce by the Wienerconstruction, that the event et, seen as punctual at the beginning, consistsof at least three moments of time tl, t2, ty Thus the internal structure ofsuch events can become more elaborate as the text proceeds.
In additionwe can specify with greater precision the relation between events.
In thecase of e I and e 2 we are now able to conclude, that the overlap of thebeginning has to be understood as a subset-relation between e2 and e 1.In the following we will make use of this conception within the definitionof our models for representations of texts.The Akfionsarten, redefined by Vandler, have frequently served ascriterion to correctly construct lme-structures from natural anguage-texts./cf.Dowty 1986,Hiurichs,Par tcc/.The opinion is not tenable however that telic events (accomplishments,achievements), in the absence of temporal adverbials, hift the referencetime for new temporal units forward, and that activities, or so-called atelicevents, and states do not.
This is often argued in the literature.Exampte 1 :(e O) John I,~rote a program.
(e 1) Ite togged in,(e z) opened his f i l e  and(e 3) began writing and correcting by using his papers.ExampLe 2:(e O) Yesterday a tot of things happened.
(e 1) John bought a bicycte,(e 2) Mary den~tished Stantey's microwave oven.In example 1, el,...,e 3are internally ordered subevents of e 0.
In example 2,no obvious ordering between eI and e 2 exists.Without infereneing and using a detailed analysis of discourse fimctionsas "continuatiolf' or "elaboration" we can not establish the right orderingrelations for =:uch cases.It is ewm harder to state correctly temporal relations within acompositions t approach:Exar%t~ \[e 3:(e O) John took the ptane to Frankfurt.
(e 1) Then he took the tra in to Stuttgart.
(s 1) As he'd had nothing to eat since breakfast(e 2) he bought e sandt~ieh at the station.e)(e\] )  Then he bordered the t ra in .b)(e 3) Then he 19aoned his uife to say that he=d arrived,(e 4) before tsking the tram horle.Only when p,'ocessing the fourth sentence of example 3 (lo we discoverthat e 2 is an elaboration of e 1 in the case of a), whereas in b) e 2 is acontinuation ~)f e 1.Thus what we should do in the first step of the analysis is to construct anunderspecified ordering hoping that in the second step, on the basis of therepresentation* of the whole text, we can refine the conditions.
We restrictourselves to cases as in example 1 and 3, becansc here it suffices that onereference point is provided by the representation f the preceding text.To repret;ent the ambiguity between continuation and elaboration weneed a relation "not-before".
However to define "not-before" as a transitiverelation the disjunction of < and o (< ; o) is not sufficient.
This becomesclear from e:mmples 1 and 3 which would then be expressed by thefollowing:%0 (<;o) e 1 (<;o) e 2 (<;o) e3" (e 3 not-before  2 not-before l... )Because o is not transitive, for an admitted reading "e 0 o e 1 o e 2 o e3"(which would be true in cases where e 1 is a subevent of Co, e x a subeventof e 1 and so on) one cannot exclude the possibility that "e 3 < el" , which issurely not the case for such episodic readings.Exempt e 4: e 3-- e 2e 1Thus we have to require:V el,e 2 ( e 2 not-before  1<->e l<e 2 ; (e  lee  2a(Ve  s e s<e 1 ->e 3<%)) ) .This suffices for transitivity as easily can be shown.Nevertheless we intend to tackle the problem in a second way; firstbecause we want to be able to state a relation of isomorphy between eventstructures and Allen's interval structures /cf.Allen/, and second, becausewe want to make use of the eveut calculus of Kowalski and Sergot withinour inference component.
In their approach events are fike points.
To thisend we need extensions of pure event structures.It has been proposed, by Moens and Steedman among others/cf.Moens,Steedman/, partly with the intention of making Kowalski andSergot's event calculus available for natural language systems, to representthe extent of structured events, i.e.
accomplishments and activities, therebyconceding them starting and final events Cstart-events" and "stop"- or"culminafion-events").
This method is also adopted within our approach.In combination with the Wiener method of constructing pure time units,this finer granulation allows us to conceive the o-relation as artequivalence relation for so-called secondary events, which, as we will see,is another way of solving the problem of "not-before".The model for DRS's used here is an extended version of the point-event-structure model with a domain of individuals proposed by Kamp.The version in this paper is a continuation of the modcl in/Reylc/ .An extended point-event s ructure with a domain of individuals i  given by:<E, 'l;,d, U,&b, <,o, start, end, F, G >where Ihe following is the case:* E is tile set of events and is subdivided into primary and secondaryevents: Primer, Seeev.
* Primer is subdivided into Acc (accomplishments), Act (activities) andAch (achievements).
* start, end are partial functions over the primary events with values in thedomain of the secondary events such that each element of thisdomain is a value of one of these fimctions.
* Secev is subdivided into the subclasses Start (start-event), Stop (stop-event) and (htl (culmination-event).
* S is the set of states.
* P(T) stands for the set of periods which can be formed from theelements in T, which is the set of atomic, purely temporal units,whereby* T contains all atomic elements which arc constructed out of E and Sthrough the Wiener constrnction.
* d is a (<,o)-homomorphism, which relates the events in E and the statesin S to the corresponding purely temporal entities in P(T).
*// is the set of individuals* The following holds:every accomplishment x is assigned exactly one start-event x I and eitherone stop-event x 2 or one cul-event x2,every activity x is assigned exactly one start-event x I and one stop-event ~,every achievement x is assigned exactly one cul-event x2,whereby tile assignment of secondary events to primary events, incombination with conditions about the relations <,o can be graphicallyillustrated as follows:xx 6 Acc, or x 6 Act: .

In the case ofexample 2 we assume an indicing which does not allow an internalordering.An advantage of this representation, using secondary events, forunderspecified texts, over a representation with differentiated orderingrelations, such as Allen's interval structures/eft.
l ien/,  is, for example, itsnotational efficiency:If el,e 2 E Ace, then the following holds:start(el) <p start(e2) is equivalent to e 1 (= ;< ;o;s;siBdi;fi) e 2162Using the further estrictionV e EAch, e 2 ESecev:end(e) = e2-> (VyEEUsUP(T) :  y < e 2 <-> y < e)one can show easily that within the event substructure of the extendedpoint-event structure the relations that Allen uses can be defined in termsof o and < such that a relation of isomorphy holds between such extendedevent structures and Allen's interval structures.
(In general this is not thecase for the original event structures).
13) The imperfectlve paradox and the ambiguity o f  the Aktionsarten inGermanNo attempts to solve the paradox that I an~ familiar with have been ableto reduce the validity of a sentence in the progressive form to the validityof the same sentence without a progressive, which was the intent.
2Moens and Steedman, with their aspectual net, have proposed a solutionin which progressives are only generated from the activity readings ofevents.
I will adopt this view to a certain extent, but will take it one stepfurther, by bringing in beliefs, in order to create the possibility ofreestablishing a direct relation at least for some kinds of accomplishments.The basic idea is that it is often only on the level of a text that the hearercan decide whether or not the culmination of an accomplishment, whichhas been introduced by a progressive, has actually been reached.
Sometexts will leave this decision open, others will force the existence of aculmination, and still others will force ihe nonexistence of a culmination.Especially in this last case, it is necessary to question the justification ofthe use of the progressive state for an accomplishment: how do we knowthe goal of an action if it is not attained?
These possible characteristics ofa text should be reflected by the different possibilities of assigning anembedding function relative to a DRS in a model M.We therefore require for a function f, which maps discourse referents ofa DRS K onto entities in an expanded point-event s ructure with a domainof individuals, in addition to the usual features/eL Reyle/, the following:M I=f, K start(e) < end(e) iff startM(f(e)) <M endM(f(e)) and eitherendM(f(e)) E Stop M or endM(f(e)) E Cul MIn addition the DRS construction algorithm ust contain the rule:For all e E Ace, e' E E U S U P(T) : end(e) <p e' -> end(e) ~ CnlIf one requires, as in the correlation principle, that every stateintroduced by the progressive of an accomplishment verb be contained byan event, then the question whether e has a culmination (that is,represents a true accomplishment) or just a stop-point (that is ,corresponds to the activity reading of an accomplishment), is transformedinto the question of the existence of the corresponding f.Compat~ tothis end the analogous approach in/Schulz/.
In a subsequent paper we wantto generalize the result with respect to the whole temporal substructure of an extendedpoint-event structure.2 Dowty's attempt using ~i~tcrtia worlds ~ seen'~s to lead to difficulties with respect to thecorrect non-subjective definition of the notion of an inertia world/el.Dowry 1970\].On the other hand, the question whether a corresponding expression inGerman is to bc read as the progressive of an accomplishment or as a realaccomplishment will not necessarily be decided on tiae sentence level.
Weenter start(e) < end(e) and make the interpretation of end(e) depend onthe possibility oi?

endt e4)Incorporating a spatial-temporal inference component (ill the second stepof the analysis) which uses rules that deal with presuppositions andresltltiug state,,, with respect o events and states, one would get, in psetulo-prolog notation:loe(stort (e l ) ,h ,s idel (street) )end(e 1) G Cut -> loc(endtel),h,side2(street))I oct end(e3), h, i n(st reet))i oc(end(e4), h, i n(st reet))term(e4,exists(h))t rue(end(el ), exi st s(h))On the basis of these facts one can conclude that no linear ordering ofthe secondary events can exist if end(el) C Cul lmlds.
Therefore we makeuse of an extended version of the event-calculus by introducing for eachfinear reading which is to be tested "auxiliary" events to get endpoints forthe introduced states if needed.
If such events contradict with respect o astory an assumption wtfid~ one could call the relevance-principle, theproposed linear reading is rejected.
This relevance-principle for instancewould predict that in a story in which the agent crosses the street but isnevertheless later located in the street, an event of reentering the streetshould be mentioned.Tiros, every embedding function f, on the basis of the appropriateaxioms, must map end(ca) onto an element from Stop M. e I is interpretedas a non-real accomplishment and this part of the text is no longerambignous.
When translating this representation i to a natural language,the corresponding state-marker and not the corresponding twent-markermust be considered 3.~A technical vm'iant of this alethod (with different embedding conditions) assigns everyaccomplishnleat a culmination point.
The CuJlllillation points of accolnplishn'tetus whichcannot be assigned a linear reading call be undel~tood asentrance points to an inertiaworld /cf.
Dowry ~970/.
For the sake of completeness, one would then have to generateadditional stop l~fiats for such e's anti label them as norl-real acconxplishtllents~ as ill thefirst variant.4) luteusionul model of a DRSAlthough the correlation principle implies a relation between a sentencewilh tire progressive form and the same sentence without, it also makesdependent on f the question of whether the corresponding event to aprogressive form of an accomplishment can be read as a realaccomplishment or not.If not, one must ask according to which criteria the specialdeterminability of assertions about accomplishments is justified, sincewithout the possibility of checking the result, the descriptions ofprogressives such as:Exampte 6:a) "Hans war dabei auf don gerggipfel zu kLettern"b) "lions ~al' dabei auf die Iluette unterhaib des Gipfels zu klettern.
",in case the corrcspondiug events are not completed, collapse into thedescription of a perception of an activity: "Hans klctterte".What are the criteria for considering one state to be fulfilled at time tand the other not?
It seems to me that one possibility of cwthtating suchcases could consist in referring to beliefs.
Thcrc is no doubt that not allaccomplishments inw}lve agency, and even in the case of agency there isnot always intcntionality by the agent (cf.
Dowty's nolion of"controllahility").
But on thc one hand intentionality and associated activitycan serve as a sufficient condition for the validity of a progressive state.On the other hand, in other cases, the introduction of beliefs can serve torepresent expectations of the speaker or mentioned protagonistsconnected to tire introduction of such progressive states.
Thus we get atleast a further instrument to represent ambiguous readings.
Our aim is uotto provide the correct truth-conditions for nonintentkmal cases.
Herefurther research is needed.
Wc restrict ourselves to the description ofcases as in example 6 and we will concentrate on the notion of belief in aframework where time comes into play.For cases as in example 6 we require that:"Hans ist dabei attf den Berggipfel zu klettern" be true at tifan activity e of climbing by Hans in the direction of the peak exists wheretce .andif Iqans has the intention of climbing the motmtain at t, i.e.
in the"belief state" of l laus at t there exists an (:vent e wlfich he wants toaccomplish.A DRS-Notation:IHans(tOI Berg(v)Is: JProg ktettern_auf(u,v) II s ' : l  pI Jbet ieve(u,p)\[ IP:" i r e nI le: Iktettern_auf(i, r )J JAc~te) Cut(end(e))I l:t:rtv (?)

.ig3For the interpretation f such DRS's it is useful to expand the concept of aDRS model.
Extending the model of/Asher/, we define:Intensional point-event s ructure with a domain of individuals:< w,n,// /cc// //r>The following holds:* Wis a set of worlds*D=U(Dw:WEW )* Dw = < <E,T,d,U, <,o, start, end, S,b>w,K,K',K">For every w E W <E,T,d,U, <,o, start, end, S,b > w is a point-event s ructurewith a domain of individuals and the corresponding conditions.K is a set of DRSs.K' is a set of "delineated" DRSs.K" is a set of "predicative" DRSs.
(For our porposes K' is of interest.
K and K" m'e mentioned only for thesake of completeness).
* / / / /G  maps every relation R onto a function, which assigns to every wE W an element out of the powerset ofU ~N(~wXUwn U U"  U K" U K'" U K"").
* / / / / F  maps "believe" onto a function which assigns to every w e W afunction which assigns to every i E P(T)w a subset of(U w x powerset(K')),maps "start","end","d" onto functions, which assign to everyw E W a function from E w onto Ew, resp.
from E w onto P(T)w,(b w as b above),maps every relation R onto a function, which assigns to everyw E W a function which assigns to every i E P(T)w a subset ofUw".f is an embedding function of a DRS K in an intensional model iff maps/all individual reference markers of U k onto elements of U Uw,all event reference markers of U k onto elements of U Ew,all state reference markers of U k onto elements of U Sw,all DRS reference markers of U k onto elements of K,all n-place condition reference markers of U k onto n-ary predicativeDRS's in K",all belief reference markers of U k onto sets of "delineated DRS's" in K'.The decisive requirement on a belief-state such as above:ra I =w,e,K s' : IS' (p ~ u(IS'), p:IS E Con(IS'),where U(K0' ) is the universe and Con(is') the set of conditions of K0' )iff3 g ,f ~ g: g(p) = {k r' \[ r' E I} for some set of indices I,andbw(f(s)) = <i,<believe,f(u),g(p)> >such that <f(u),g(p)> ~//bel ieve//F(w)(i)and3 k z' V k r' ~ {kr' I r' ~ I} such that k 2' < k r' (1~' is a proper portion of kr'),such that < f(u),k2'> E//believe//F(w)(i)andV k r' E {kr' I r' ~ I} q i r e i such that < f(u),kr'> E//believe//F(w)(ir)andk 3' < k 2' such that H/0,0,Ug(p),M/(k3' ) ~ H/g,Uk0,0,M/(IS )andH/0,0,Ug(p),M/(k3'* ) $ 0164The essential but simplified principle is to be described as follows:f is, as usual, an embedding function from U k into the domain of apoint-event s ructure, indexed here with w. Beliefs are assigned structures.Since the beliefs of the agent can change within the considered time-interval we require that the value of p be a set of structures, {k r' \[ 1 < r' _<m}.
For the description of the belief - K 0 - to be true it is necessary thatthere is a proper portion - k 2' - that all the different belief-states have incommon.
One part of that portion - k 3' - should be described by K 0.
Westate that the description of the belief - K 0 - is correct when the set ofpossible worlds in which the corresponding part of the portion - k 3' - istrue is contained in the set of possible worlds in which the description istrue.
The treatment of "internal anchors" remains to be integrated.For a more detailed review compare the basic model in lasher~, where,in particular, the function H is defmed along with the remaining truthconditions.5.
Conclusion:The system considered here allows a solely partial ordering of events antistates on the representational level, which can be completed on the basisof world knowledge stored in a data base, with respect to the ordering andthe dassiflcation i to Aktionsarteu.
The compositionality principle for theconstruction of a semantic representation can thereby be maintained.Ambiguous readings are kept as such, impossible readings are rejected.The expansion to an intensional model for DRS's not only would permit ina certain way the restatement of the relation between some kinds ofaccomplishments and the corresponding progressive states , but it alsowould allow, through the use of the belief predicate, an extended versionof the theory to correctly represent ambiguities such as is made clear inthe following examples through the use of different indices.Exampte 7:"Mary saw OswaLd shoot Kennedy"a) Mary saw Oswald/Mary shoot KennedY/Maryso~ooeb) Mary saw /Mary shoot KennedY/MaryOsws ld/speakcra) and b) are to be represented by different instantiatlons of thearguments for the predicate "believe".
A further possible xpansion, alsorelating to incomplete accomplishments, is the incorporation of unfinishedobjects.Bibliography:ASItEILN.
