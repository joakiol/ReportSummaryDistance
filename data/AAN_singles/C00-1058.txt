National Inst itute of hffonnatics2-1.-2 Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-8430 JapanE-Mail: {kyo,akiko} @nii.ac.jptGraduate School of Education, University of Tokyo,7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113 JapanE-Mail: i34188{hn-unix.cc.u-tokyo.ac.jpAbstract;11, this paper, we propose a method of gen-(',rating bilingual keyword eh.lsters or thesaurifrom parallel or comi.m, able bilingual corpora.The method combines nmrphological nd lex-ical processing, bilingual word aligmnent, andgraph-theoretic cluster generation.
An experi-ment shows that the method is promising.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper, we propose a method of auto-matte bilingual thesaurus generation by a com-bination of methods or multiple tiltering.
Theprocedure consists of three modules: (i) a mor-phological and lexical processing module, (it) atranslation pair extraction module, and (iii) acluster generation module.
The method takesparallel or comparable corpora as input, andproduces as outlmt bilingual keyword clusterswith a reasonable computational cost.Our aim is to construct domain-orientedbilingual thesauri, which are much in need bothfor cross-language IR and tbr technical tr~msla-tors.
We assume domain-dependent parallel orcomparM)le corpora as a source of inibrmation,which are.
abundant in case of Japanese and En-glish.The techniques used in each module arereasonably well developed, including statisticalword alignment methods.
Itowever, there re-main at le.ast three problems: (i) ambiguity ofmultiple hNmx combinations ill an aligmnent,which cannot be resolved by purely statisticalmethods, (it) syntagmatie unit mismatches, es-pecially in such cases as English and Jal)anese,and (iii) difficulty ill final cleaning-up 1 .In this paper, we show that the proper com-bination of the above modules can be useful es-pecially for resolving the cleaning-up roblemand can produce good results in bilingual ellis-ter or thesaurus generation.2 MethodThe procedure for thesaurus generation con-sists of the following three main nlodules.
(1) Morphological and lexical processing mod-ule: keyword milts 2 for English and Japaneseare extracted separately.
(2) Translation pair extraction module: statis-tical weighting is applie.d to a corpus which hasbeen through the morl}hological nd lexical pro-cessing module.
The ailn of this stage is not todetermine mdque translation pairs, but to re-strict translation candidates to a reasonable ex-tent.
(3) Cleaning and cluster generation module:a bilingual keyword graph is constructed onthe basis of" the pairs extracted at translationpair extraction module, and a graph-theoreticmethod is applied to the keyword graph, to gen-erate proper keyword clusters by removing er-roneous links.If we want to obtain a clean lexicon, minor trans-lation variations tend to be omitted, while many errorswould be included if we want to retain minor variations.2 The word 'keyword' implies words that are impoftant with respect to documents or domains.
In this pa-per, we use the word for convenience, roughly in the81une se~lse as "content-bearing words".
If necessary, amodule of keyword or terin weighting (e.g.
Fl'antzi $?Ananiadou 1995; Nakagawa & Mort 1998) can be incor-porated easily.3972.1 Morphological gz lexical processingAt this stage, basic lexical units or keywordcandidates are extracted.
We separately extractminimum or shortest units and maxinnlm orlongest complex units as syntagmatic units forkeyword candidates.
So two outputs are pro-duccd from this module, i.e.
a bilingual key-word corpora of minimum units and another ofmaximum units.The processing proceeds as follows:(a) Morphological analysisFirst, the cortms is morphologically anal-ysed and POS-tagged.
Currently, JUMAN3.5(Kurohashi ~z Nagao 1998) is used for Japaneseand LT_POS/LT_CHUNK (Mikheev 1996) isused for English.
(bl) Ext raet lon  of min imum unitsMinimum units in English are simply de-fined as non-flmctional simple words extractedfrom the output of LT_POS.
Minimum mean-ingful units in Japanese are defined as:C_Pref ix* (C_AdvlC_AdjlN) C Suf f ix*where C_ indicates that the unit should consistof either Chinese characters or Katakana 3 .
(b2) Extraction of maximum unitsMaximum complex units for English are theunits extracted by LT_CHUNK, with some ad-hoc modifications.Maximum complex units fin' Japanese aredefined by the following basic pattern,^C_Adj * (C_Affix l C_tdv l C_Adj \[ N) +where ^ C means that the unit should begin witheither Chinese character or Katakana.
The pat-tern remains deliberately coarse, to absorb er-rors by JUMAN.
Coarse patterns with simplecharacter type restrictions produce better re-sults than grammatically well-defined syntag-matic patterns.
A separate stop word list foraffixes is also prepared together with an excep-tional treatment routine, to make the Japaneseunits better corresl)ond to English units 4 .After these processes, two corpora, one con-sisting of minimum units and the other of max-3 In addition, we have made a few ad-hoc rules toscreen out some consistent errors produced by the mor-phological analysers.4 For instance, the Japanese suffix 'Ill' is eliminatedbecause it corresponds inmost cases to the English word'for', which tends to be excluded fi'om chunks made byLT_CHUNK.imum units, are created.Intermediate constituent units are not ex-tracted, because their inter-lingnal unit corre-spondence is less reliable.
Also, many impor-tant intermediate units of longer complex unitsappear themselves as an independent complexunit in a large domain-specific corpus, and, evenif they do not, intermediate units can be ex-tracted on the basis of minimum and maximumtranslation pairs if necessary.2.2 Extraction of translation candidatesThe module for extracting translation can-didate pairs consists of statistical weighting andpostprocessing.
These are applied to the data ofnfinimum units and maximum units separately.After that, the two data are merged to makeinput for the cluster generation module.
(a) Statistical weightingMany methods of extracting lexical transla-tion pairs have been proposed (Daille, Gaussier& Langd 1994; Eijk t993; Fung 1995; Gale ?~Church 1991; Hiemstra 1996; ltull 1998; Ku-piec 1993; Melamed 1996; Smadja, McKeown &Hatzivmssiloglou 1996).
Though it, is ditficult toevaluate the performance of existing methods asthey use ditferent corpora for evaluation 5 , theperformance does not seem to be radically dif-ferent.
We adopted log-likelihood ratio (Dan-ning 1993), which gave the best pertbrmanceamong crude non-iterative methods in our testexperiments 6 .
(b) Postproeessing f i lterAs the output of statistical weighting is sim-ply a weighted list of all English and Japaneseco-occurring pairs, it; is necessary to restricttranslation candidates o that they can be ef-t~ctively used in the graph-theoretic cluster gen-eration module.
In addition to restricting pos-sible translation pairs, it is necessary to deter-mine unique translation pairs for hapax legom-ena.
We use both macro- and micro-filteringheuristics to restrict translation candidates.
'~ A common testbed exists for French-English align-ment (Veronis 1996-99) but not for Japanese-English.6 At the time of writing this paper, we have finished apreliminary comparative xperiments of various meth-ods, among which the method proposed by Melamed(1996) gave by far the best result.
We are thus plan-ning to replace this module with the method proposedby Melamed (1996).398Two macro heuristics, applied to the over-all list of pairs, are defined, i.e.
(i) a propertranslation should have a statistical score higherthan the threshold Xs,  and (ii) a keywordshould have maximal ly Xc translations or Xp  xtoken frequertcy when the frequency is lessthan Xc.Micro heuristics uses the information withineach alignment; we assume that a keyword inone language only has one translation withinan aligninent r .
Selecting unique pairs in eachal ignment is achieved by recursively taking apair with tile highest score within an alignment,ead~ time deleting other pairs which have thesame English or Japanese elements 8 .After this process, the data  of nl ininmmunits and maximum units are merged, whichconstitutes input for the, next stage.2.3  Graph- theoret i c  c lus ter  generat ionUp to this stage, the cooccurrence inforlna-tion used to extract pairs has the depth of onlyone.
In order to el iminate erroneous transla-tions, we re-organise the extracted pairs intograph and use multi-level topological informa-tion by applying tile graph-theoret ic method.For exi)lanation , let us assume that we obtainedthe data  in Table 1 fi'om the previous module~us an input to this module.Firstly, the initial ke!jword graph is con-structed, where each node represents an Englishor JaI)anese keyword, and a link or edge repre-se.nts the pairwise relation of corresponding key-words.
W(' define the capacit~j or strength of alink by the frequency of occurrence of the pairin the corpus, i.e.. the nmnber of al ignmentsin which the pair occurs 9 .
Figure 1 shows theThis is not true for longer alignment units such asfull texts.
However, this will apply to parallel titles andabstracts which are readily available.
Many lexical align-ment methods tarting fi'om sentence-levd aligmnentsassume this or some variations of this.Many maximum unit pairs in fact have the samescore.
We used the arithmetic mean of the constituentminimum units to resolve aligmnent ambiguity.9 The score of likelihood ratio is a possible alternativefor link eai)acity, but the result of a preliminary experi-ment was no better.
In addition, after selecting pairs bythreshold, whether a pair constitutes a proper transla-tion or not is not a matter of weight, because thresholdsetting implies that all pairs above that are regarded ascorrect.
So we adopt simple frequency as the link ca-pacity.
Itowever, we notice a lack of atfinity/)etween theJapanese keywords English keywords frequency- U -- b ~ information retrieval 1g- -- q -- b ?

Example of initial keyword graphThe detect ion algorithm is based on the sim-ple principle that sets of links, which decomposea connected keyword cluster into disjoint sub-clusters when they are removed fronl tile origi-nal cluster, are candidates for improt)er transla-tions.
In graph theory, such a link set is calledan edge cut and the edge cut with the min-imal total  capacity is called a m, inimum edgecut.
A min imum edge cut does not necessarilyimply a single translat ion error.
An efficient al-statistical alignment method we used here and the deft-nition of link cat)acity, which is currently under exami-nation and will be iml)roved by renewing the alignmentmodule.m This approach is radically different fl'om statisti-cally oriented word clustering (Deerwester t. al 1990;Finch 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Schiitze & Pedersen 1997;Strzalkowski 1994); this is why we use the word '(:lustergeneration' instead of 'clustering'.399I~eworU t2~,f%1: kyewo~rd .~)/;/#o;'.

Steps of graph-theoretic cluster generation(c)gorithm exists for minimum edge cut detection(Nagamochi 1993).Our procedure first checks links that shouldnot be eliminated, using the conditions: (i) thefrequency is no less than Na, (ii) the Japaneseand English notations are identical, or (iii) ei-ther of the Japanese or English expressions haveonly one corresponding translation (Figure 2(a); it is assumed that N~ = N/~ = Ne = 3).Secondly, core keywords whose fi'equency is noless than NZ are checked (Figure 2 (b)).
This isused for the restriction that each cluster shouldinclude at le~t one core keyword.
Lastly, edgecuts with a total capacity of less than Ne aredetected and removed (Figure 2 (c)).
This pro-cedure is repeated recursivety until no fllrtherapplication is possible.

Generated clusters3 Exper iment3.1 Settings and proceduresWe applied the method to Japanese andEnglish bilingual parallel corpus consisting of25534 title pairs in the field of computer sci-ence.
Table 2 shows the basic quantitative infor-mation after morphological nd lexical filteringwas applied.Mininmm unitsJapanese Token: 178091 Type: 14938English Token: 154554 Type: 12634Maximum unitsJapanese Token: 89742 Type: 38813English Token: 80018 Type: 41693Table 2.
Basic quantity of the dataIn the pair extraction module, the thresholdXs' was set to 1011 .
The parameter X c w~sset to 10 and Xp to 0.5.
As a result, 28905translation candidate pairs were obtained, with24855 Japanese and 23430 English keywords.Of these, 20071 pairs occurred only once and3581 only twice.
The most frequent pair oc-curred 3196 times in the corpus.
8242 (28.5%)were minimum unit pairs, and 20663 (71.5%)were maximum unit pairs.Table 3 shows the number of keywords whichhad N translations.

Number of translationsix This is purely heuristic.
Minimum units and maxi-mum units are given ditferent scores.
But only 3 pairsbelow this threshold were proper translation pairs in 100random samples of minimum unit pairs, and 5 in 100samples of maxinmn~ units.400Evaluating recall and precision on the ba-sis of 100 randonfly selected title pairs, whichconsisted of 778 keyword token pairs, the pre-cision tokenwise was 84.06% (654 correct trans-lations) and the recall was 87.08% (654 of 751correct pairs).
Typewise precision was 81.65%(543 correct of 665 pairs).The initial keyword graph generated fi'omthese 28905 translation candidates consisted of19527 independent subgraphs, with the largestcluster containing 2701 pairs (i.e.
9.3% of allthe pairs).
The cluster generation method wasapplied with parameters Na =: 4, Ne = 10and N/~ = 1) 2 .
As a result, 893 translationpairs were removed, and 20357 bilingual clus-ters were generated.

Number of chlsters by size3.2 Overal l  evaluationThe result was manually evaluated fi'om twopoints of view, i.e.
consistency of clusters andcocrectness of link removal ~3 .
(1) rib check the internal consistency, clusterswere classified into three groul)S by size, andwere separately evaluated.
2000 'small' clusters,consisting of only one pair, were randomly sam-pled and evaluated as 'correct' (c), 'more or lesscorrect' (m) or ~wrong' (w).
4t}0 medimn sizeclusters consisting of 2-9 pairs and all the 74large clusters consisting of 10 or more pairs wereevaluated as 'consistent' (c: consisting only ofclosely related keywords), 'mostly consistent'(Ill: consisting mostly of related keywords), 'hy-brid' (t1: consisting of two or more different key-word groups: 11) or q)ad' (w).
Table 5 showsthe result of the evaluation.
The general per-formance is very good, with more or less 80% ofthe clusters being meaningflfl.12 This is again determined heuristically.
For an exami-nation of the effect of parameters, ee Aizawa & Kageura(to apl)ear).~3 The evaluation was done by the first author.
Cur-rently no cross-checking has been carried out.For small clusters, the performance was sep-arately evaluated for minimuln and maximulnrefit pairs.
Note that the ratio of maximumunit pairs is comparatively higher in the smallcluster than the overall average.
Most pairsewfluated as partially correct, as well as somewrong pairs, suffered from mismatch of the syn-tagmatic units.c m w totalSmall 1389 370 241 2000(69.5%) (18.5%) (12.1%) (100%)milfimum 288 26 69 383(75.2%) (6.8%) (18.0%) 19.2%maximum 1101 344 172 1617(68.1%) (21.3%) (10.6%) 80.9%c m h wMedium 116 148 32 104(29.0%) (37.0%) (8.0%) (26.0%)Large 8 18 43 5(lo.8%) (24.3%) (58.1%) (&8%)Table 5.
Evaluation of internal consistency73% of tile medium sized clusters were 'cor-reel), 'mostly correct' or 'hybrid'.
Among the'lnostly con'ect' and 'hybrid' clusters, 97 (91and 6 respectively) were mainly caused by themismatch of the units.
For instance, in thecase: { Kid, i~iN'fL, ~i~@, optimization, opti-mal, optimisation, optimum, network optimiza-tion }, the last English keyword has the excessunit 'network'.
Other 'mostly correct' and 'hy-brid' chtsters were due to the l)roblem of corpusfrequencies.Among the large clusters, more than halfwere qlybrid '14 .
Among the hnostly correct'and qlybrid' large (;lusters, only 8 (3--t-5) weredue to unit mismatch, while 53 (15+38) weredue to quantitative factors.
This shows a strik-ing contrast o the medium sized clusters.
Largehybrid clusters tended to include lnany commonword pairs which occur fi'equently.
For instance,in the largest chlster, ' )  x ?
.z, system' (3196),'lJ~l~} development' (1097), '~tki~\] design' (1073),and 'NiL enviromnent' (890) are included dueto indirect associations.

{C6/~tJ/4) -x" ')/overview/outline/summary/smmnarization/overall14 And most of the sub-clusters in these hybrid clustersare 'mostly correct'.401/pattern/patterns/patten/patterm matchingIn the first case, the 'overall' group and the'summary' group are mixed up.
In the sec-ond case, the mismatch of syntagmatic units iscaused by borrowed words.
In fact, many errorscaused by the mismatch of syntagmatic units in-volve borrowed words written in Katakana.
(2) To look at the perfbrmance of graph-theoretic cluster generation, we exanfined theremoved pairs fl'om two points of view, i.e.
thecorrectness of link removal and the internal con-sistency of clusters generated by link remowfl.For the former, we introduced three categoriesfor evaluation: mismatched pairs correctly re-moved (c), proper translation pairs wrongly re-moved (w), and pairs of related meaning re-moved (p).
The consistency of newly generatedclusters were evaluated in the same manner asabove.c p w totalcc 90 (10.1) 53 (5.9) 39 (4.4) 182 (20.4)cm 148 (16.6) 56 (6.6) 32 (3.6) 236 (26.4)ch 96 (10.8) 20 (2.2) 6 (0.7) 122 (13.7)mm 44 (4.9) 29 (3.3) 30 (3.4) 103 (tl.5)mh 52 (5.8) lS (1.5) 5 (0.6) 70 (7.8)hh 30 (3.4) 3 (0.3) 3 (0.3) 36 (4.0)xc 42 (4.7) 9 (1.0) 9 (1.0) 60 (6.7)xm 28 (3.t) 8 (0.9) 20 (2.2) 56 (6.3)xh 8 (0.9) 2 (0.3) 5 (0.6) 15 (1.7)xx 4 (0.5) 1 (0.1) 8 (0.9) 13 (1.5)all 542 (60.7) 194 (21.7) 157 (17.6) 893 (100)Table 6.
Evaluation of removed linksTable 6 shows the result of evaluation of allthe 893 removed pairs.
'c' 'p' and 'w' in the toprow indicate types of removed links, and 'cc','cm' etc.
in the leftmost column indicate inter-nal consistencies of two clusters generated bylink removal.
A total of 157 (17.6%) of the re-moved links were correct links wrongly removed,but among them, 115 links did not produce'bad' clusters.
If we consider them to be toler-able, only 42 removals (4.7%) were fatal errors.By exanfining the renloved links, wc foundthat the links removed at the higher edge capac-ity included more wrongly removed pairs.
Forinstance, among 142 edges removed at capacity4 (which is the maximum deletable value set byN,~), 41 or 28.9% were wrongly removed correcttranslations, while among 288 links removed atcapacity l, only 15 or 5.2 % were correct trans-lations.4 Discuss ionFrom the experiment, we have found somefactors that affect performance.
(1) Many errors were produced at the stage ofextracting keyword milts, by syntagmatic mis-match.
A substantial nmnber of them involvedJapanese Katakana keywords.
Thereibre, in ad-dition to the general refinement of the morpho-logical processing module, the perfbrmance willbe improved if we use string proxinfity informa-tion to determine syntagmatic units 15 .
(2) We expect that some errors produced bystatistical weighting and filtering could be re-moved by applying stemming and orthographicnormalisations, which are not flflly exploited inthe current implementation.
Looking back fromthe cluster generation stage, frequently occur-ring keywords tend to cause problems due toindirect associations.
At the time of writing, weare radically changing the statistical alignmentmodule based on Melamed (1996) and incorpo-rating iterative alignment anchoring routine sothat the method can be applied not only to titlesbut also to abstracts, etc.
Used in conjunctionwith string proximity and stemming inforina-tion, we might be able to retain nfinor va.riationsproperly.
(3) At the cluster generation stage, we observedthat correct links tend to be wrongly removedfor higher capacities of edge cut.
In the cur-rent implementation, the parameter values re-main the same for all the clusters.
Performancewill be improved by introducing a method ofdynamically changing the parameter w-dues ac-cording to the cluster size and the frequenciesof their constituent pairs.5 Conclus ionWe have proposed a method of constructingbilingual thesauri automatically, fl'om parallelor comparable corpora.
The experiment showedthat the performance is fairly good.
We are cur-rently improving the method further, along thelines discussed in the previous ection.
Furtherexperiments are currently being carried out, us-ing the data of narrower domains (e.g.
artificialls This can also be used for resolving hapax ambiguity.402intelligence) as well as abstracts instead of ti-tles.At the next stag(.
', we are 1)lanning to eval-uate the method fi'om the point of view of per-formance of generated clusters in practical ap-plications.
We are currently planning to applythe generated clusters to query expansion anduser navigation in cross-lingual Il ., as well as toon-line dictionary lookup systems used as trans-lation aids.AcknowledgementThis research is a part of the researchproject "A Study on Ubiquitous InformationSystems tbr Utilization of Highly DistributedInformation FLesources", fimded by the JapanSociety for the Promotion of Science.Re ferences\[1\] Aizawa, A.
