PROJECT GOALSThe primary objective of this project is to develop a robust,high-performance, domain-independent spoken languagesystem.
This system, termed HARC (Hear and Respond toContinuous speech), is composed of the BYBLOS speechrecognition system and the DELPHI natural languageunderstanding system.
The goal is to develop systems thatexhibit the following advances: high-accuracy speechunderstanding with a vocabulary of up to 10,000 words; ahighly interactive user interface; adaptability to new users;easy portability to new applications; a system implementablein real-time on cost-effective COTS (commercial, off-the-shelf) hardware.2.
RECENT RESULTSDuring the last year, we have:Designed and developed an initial implementation f, andbegan experimenting with, HUM, a Hidden UnderstandingModel.
HUM is a new statistical model of semantics whichwill enable us to carry out studies in the alignment ofcorpora to semantic interpretations.
The ultimate goal ofHUM is to achieve understanding comparable or superior toother approaches, but using an automatic process tocorrelate words with meanings (instead of depending onhand-crafted semantic rules).Made a number of improvements sin DELPHI, includingexpanding the coverage of the Semantic Linker,improvements to quantif ication module, theimplementation of sub-grammars, improvements in thehandling of conjunctions, and the production ofinterpretations in the language FMRL (Flattened MRL)instead of older-style MRL.?
Ported our ATIS development system to the HP735 machineto allow faster turn-around time for development.?
Collected additional ATIS data for the general community,using our real-time system and the new, expanded atabase.?
Delivered a version of our interactive ATIS system to NISTwhich they subsequently used for successful data collection.Improved the recognition accuracy for new words that werenot in the speech training, and made the speech languagemodel more robust o different phraseology.Made improvements to our real-time ATIS demo system andATIS speech models, to improve usability and robustness.Improved the discourse component of DELPHI, making itbetter able to handle the sorts of task constraints whichspeakers impose in spoken interactions.Participated in discussions aimed at defining anddeveloping semantic evaluation metrics.
We made aproposal for the predicate-argument structure component ofSemEval that is under consideration by the SemEvalcommittee.Made plans to port HARC to a new domain, involving anunclassified database similar to one in use at RomeLaboratory.Participated in the December 1993 ARPA speech, NL, andSLS evaluations.Participated in various APRA committees.3.
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARContinue the development of the Hidden UnderstandingModel.Development of aids to technology transfer.Improvements o search algorithms for speech recognitionwhich allow fighter integration of knowledge sources (suchas higher-order grammars) to improve real-timerecognition accuracy without sacrificing speed.Port HARC to the Rome Laboratory domain.Participate in the planning and development of the ATIS4task and new evaluation methodology.447
