S. A.Abstract: We study the weak generative capacity of a class ofparenthesis-free categorial grammars derived /torn those ofAries and Steedman by varying the set of reduction rules.With forward cancellation as the only rule, the grammars areweakly equivalent o context-free grammars.
When a back-ward combination rule is added, it is no longer possible to oh-lain all the context-free languages.
With suitable restrictionof the forward partial rule, the languages are still context-freeand a push-down automaton can be used for recognition.
Us-ing the unrestricted rule of forward partial combination, acontext-sensitive language is obtained.INTRODUCTIONThe system of categorial grammars, developed ill lnoderntimes from the work of Ajdukiewicz (1935), has recently beenthe attention of renewed interest, hlspired by the use of categori--al notions in Montague gramlnar~ more recent systems, sneh asGPSC, have developed related corlccpts and notations.
This inturn leads to a resurgence of interest in pure catcgorial systems.Classically, a categorial grammar is a quadrupleG(VT,  VA , J ; , F ) ,  where VT is a finite set of morl)hemes ,and VA is a tinite set of atomic categories, one of which is thedistinguished category S. The set CA of categories is formedfrom VA as follows: (1) VAisasubset  of CA, (2) if X and Yare in CA, t.hcJ, (X,"Y) is  I CA The grammar also (:md.ain,~ alexicon F, which is a function from words to finite subsets ofCA.
A categorial grammar lacks rules; instead there is a cancellation ride mq)lieit ill the formalism: if X and Y arecategories, then (X /Y )  Y -' X.The lauguage of a categorial grammar is the set of te rminal strings with corresponding category symbol stringsreducible by cancellation to the sentence symbol S.In \[1\] Ades and Steedman offer a form of categorial grammarin which some of the notations and concepts of the usualcategorial grammar are modified.
The formalism at first appearsto be more powerful, because in addition to tile cancellationrule there are several other metarutes.
IIowever, on closer examination there are other reasons to suspecl, that tile resultinglanguage class (lifters sharply from that of the traditionalgrammars.
Among the new rules, the forward partial rule (FI)rule) is most interesting, since one may immediately conchlde thatthis rule leads to a very large number of possible parsings of anysentence (almost equal to the number of different binary trees ofn leaves if the length of the sentence is n).
But its effects on thegenerative power of categorial grammar are not really obvious andimmediate.
Ades and Steedman raised the question in the foot-note 7 in \[1\] and left it unanswered.
We will first formally definecategorial grammar and the associated concepts.
Then we analyzethe generative power of the categoriat gralnmars with differentinteresting combinations of the reduction rnles.The categorial gralrnnars considered here consist of both acategorial component and a set of reduction rules.
The categorysymbols differ from the traditional ones hecause they areparenthesis-free.
The categorial component Cmlsists as before ofa set VA of atomic categories including a distinguished symbolS, and a lexical function F mapping words to finite sets ofcategories.
However, the definition of category differs: (1) VA isasubset  of CA, (2) i fX i s in  CA, and A is in  VA, thenX/A isin CA.
Notice that the category symbols arc parenthesis free;the implicit parenthesization is left to right.
Thus the symbol(A / (B /C  )) of traditiolml categorial grammar is excluded,since A/B/C  abbreviates ( (A /B  )/C ).
ltoweve.r, some of therules treat A/B/C  as though it were, in fact, (A / (B /C  )).\ ] )EHNITIONSNotation.
We use A, B, C to denote atomic category symbols,and U, V, X, Y to denote arbitrary (complex) category symbols.The number of occurrences of atomic category symbols in X isI X I' Strings of category symbols are denoted by x, y. Morpheme, s are denoted by a, b; *norpheme strings by u, v, w.A categorial grammar under certain reduction rides is a quadruple G1?

We write: U/A A -* U;{2) (\]i'P Rule) If U/A, A /V  E CA, where A E VA, the stringU/A A~ V can be replaced by U~ V. We write: U/A A.

The single cancellation rule is theforward combination rule.
It is well known that traditionalcategorial grammars are equivalent o context--free grammars.We examine the proof to see that it still goes through forcategorial grammars GR with R = IF}.Theorem The categorial grammars GI~, R = {F}, generateexactly the context free langnages.Proof (1) l,et GR be a eategorial grammar with R = IF}.
Gt~becomes a traditional categorial gralnmar once parentheses arerestored by replacing them from left to right, so that, e.g.,A/B/C  becomes ( (A/B)/C) .
Hence, its language is CF.
(2) To show that every context- free language can be obtained,we begin with the observation that every context free languagehas a grammar in Greibach 2 form, that is, with all rules of thethree forms A ~> aBC, A -> aB, and A -> a, where A,B, Care in VN and a is in VT \[6\].
A corresponding classicalcategorial grammar can be irnmediate\]y constructed:~"(~) ~- I ( (A/C) /B) ,  (A/B), A}.
These are the categoriesA/C/B ,  A/B,  and A of a parenthesis free categorial grammar.The details of the proof can be easily carried out to show that thetwo languages generated are the same.CRAMMARS WITH BACKWARDS CANCELLATION:\['he theorem shows that with R = {F} exactly the contextfree languages are obtained.
What happens when the addi-tional metarules are added?
We examine now parenthesis-freecategorial grammars with R = {F, B} and R = {F, P, s}.
RuleB s is the version adopted in \[11; B is an obvious generalization.
Ineither case we are adding the equivalent of context free rulesto a grammar; the result must therefore still yield a contextfree language.
So one guess might be that categorial gram--mars ol these types will still yield exactly the context freelanguages, perhaps with more structm'es for each sentence.
Analternative conjecture would be that fewer languages are ob-tained, for we have now added some "involuntary"context free rules to every grammar.Example: Consider the standard context free language L 1 = {a" b n \] n>0}.Theea~alestgrammaris S -> aSb, S -> ab.
TheCreibach 2 form grammar is S -> aSH, B ->b, S -> aB.
Theconstructed categorial grammar GI~ then has f (a )= {S/B,S /B /S}  and F (b) = {B }.
If R = IF}, this yields exactly I, vIlowever, with R = {F, B} or R = {F, B s}, here equivalent, GRyields alanguage L2 = {ab, ba, aabb, abab, bbaa, baba, baab, ...}, which contains L1 and other strings as well.
It is thelanguage of the context free grammar with rule set {S ->bC, S-> Cb, C -> aS', C-> Sa, C-> a}.Reversible languages.

{a "b I n >0} is not areversible language.Theorem The languages of categorial grammars GR with R =IF, B} are reversible.Proof if x => *S, then z n => *S by a reduction whose tree isthe mirror image of the one for x in which rules F and B havebeen interchanged.Theorem Let G,~ be a categorial grammar with R contains {F,B} or {l", B s }- R may or may not also contaln some form ofFP rules.
If L (G~) contains any sentence of length greater thanone, then it contains at least one sentence w uv such that vu isalso in L (GR).200Proof Let w be a sentence of L (G n ) of length greater than one.Suppose the final step of the reduction to S uses rule F. Then wu vwhere u -> ~ S /A  and v >* A.
But then v u >*  AS/A  -> Sby  rule B or Bs .
No form of FP can be used a~qthe final step of the reduction to S, so its presence does not affectthe result.Corol lary There are context free languages that cannot beobtained by any categorial grammar G~, where R contains {F,B} or {F, B s}.CATBGORIAL GRAMMAR, IS CONTEXT-FREE 1F THE FPRULE IS RESTRICTEI)Tile method that had been used to construct a context freegrammar G equivalent o a classical categorial grammar can beformally described as following:/~ / Foreaehae VT, i fX~ F(a),then put X -> a in G;For each derivable category X/Y ,  put X ~ X /Y  Y in G.This method remains valid when B s rule is added.
We just needto put an additional rule X -> Y X /Y  in G whenever X is headed by S. But this doesn't work when the FP rule is allowed.
Wemight put in the CF rule U/V  -> U/A A /V  for each derivablecategory U/V  and for each atomic category A, but in case thereis a category like A/B/A ,  then any category symbol headed by Afollowed by B's and ended by A is a derivable category.
There areinfinitely many of them, so by using this construction method, wemight have to put in an infinite number of CF rules.
Therefore,this method does not always find a finite context free grammarequivalent to a category grammar with the FP rule.
As we shallsee, there may be no such context free grammar.Let's now enf'orce some restrictions on the FP rule so that itwon't cause an infinite number of derivable categories.
Actually,using the FP rule sometimes violates the parenthesis convention,e.g.
applying FP ~n 4 'B t?
"(?/D bnplle~ ~hat B/C/D is interpreted as (B/(C/D)) .
tlowever, by the parenthesis convention,B/C/D is the abbreviation of ((B/C)/D).
Notice, however,when the second category symbol ha~ exactly two atomic symbols, i.e., is in form A/B,  the FP rule does not violate the con-vention.
Coincidentally, if the FP rule is accordingly restricted asto FP z, the derivable category set becomes finite.Lemma For a categorial grammar G~(VA,  VT ' ,S ,F ) ,  letR I={F ,FP2},  R2={F,FP2 ,  Bs}; and Rz={F,FPe ,  P,},then DAI~ 1 = DAR2 = DAR3.Proof From the definition ii) of DA, we can see that any newcategory Z added to DA by a form of the B rule can be added bythe F rule.
The lemma follows.\[\]Lemma The derivable category set DA of a eategorial grammarGI~ with R = /F ,  FP 2} is finite and constructible.Sketch of Proof We begin with the observation that none of thereduction rules in R increases the length of category symbols, andthe initial lexical category symbols are all of finite length.
Thisimplies that the length of all the derivable category symbols arebounded.
So there are only finitely many of them.We now give an algorithm for computing DA, to show that, itis constructible.Algorithm: Compute DA of a Gn with R = {F , FP 2}.Input: A categorial grammar G R ( V T ,  VA ,  S,  f' )R ={F,FP2}.Output: DA of Ga.Method:LetDA = U l " (a) ;aEVTRepeatFor all non atomic categories U/A C DA(1) I fA ~ DA Then DA = DA U {U };(2) For all non atomic categories A/B E DAw it hDA = DA tO {U/B };Until DA was not updated m'ing the last iteration.\]Return DA.\[\]Theorem For every categorial grammar G R ( V T , VA  , S ,  F ),with R ={F ,FP2 ,  Bs},  there is a context free grammarG (VT ,  VN,  S ,  P )  such that L (G, t )=L (G).Sketch of Proof Since DA is finite, the method for convertingCC to CFG described in last section works.\[\]Remark  The theorem remains true for R being {F , FP 21 andIF , FP 2, B }, and can be similarly proved.
We chooseR = {F, FP 2, B s} to state the theorem because it is closest oAdes and Steedman's model \[1\].THE FP RULE IS USEFUL ONLY ON S tIEADEDCATEG ORIESNow the next question is what if the I"P rule is not restrictedto U/A  A /B  -~ U/B.
Intuitively, we can see that the applica-tion of the FP rule on a category which is not headed by S is notcrucial in the sense that it carl be replaced by an application ofthe F rule, because whenever U/A  A /V  appears in a validderivation to a sentence, the V part nlust be cancelled out sooneror later, so we can make a new derivation that cancels the V partfirst and get U/A  A on which we can apply the F rule instead ofthe FP rule.
But this doesn't hold if U/A  is headed by S. For example, when we have A S /B  B /A ,  we can't do backward comb|nation on A and S/A  if we don't combine S/B  and B/A  first.
So,~e expect that the weak generative power of categorial grammarwould remain unchanged if the FP rule is restricted t~, bt usedonly on categories which are headed by S. This in fact follows asour next theorem.Lemma Given a categorial grammar Gi?
( VT  , VA , S ,  F ) withR ={F ,FP ,Bs} ,  for any w E CA* and A ~VA,  if there is areduction w - ->*  A, then there is a reduction of w to C using FPrule only on categories which are headed by S.Sketch of Proof Formalize tile idea illustrated abow!.
\[\]As an almost immediate consequence, we have:Theorem The language accepted by categorial grammarGIe(VT ,  VA ,S ,F )  with R = {F ,FP ,Bs}  is the same astImt accepted with R = {F, FP s, B s }.Proof It trivially follows the lermna.
\[\]Coro l lary  FP rule is useless if there is no form of the B rule, i.e.,any GIe (VT ,  VA ,  S ,  F )  with R = {F, FP} will generate thesame language ~us that germrated with R = {F}.A CONTEXT SENSITIVE LANGUAGE GENERATt{D USINGUNRESTRICTED FP RULEThis section gives a categorial grammar with unrestricted FPrule thai.
genera.tes a language which is not context free.
Consider categorial grammar G1 = GIe ( V A , V T , S ,  F ), where V T -{a, b, c }, VA -- {A, C, S},  r (a )  = {A }, F (b )  = {S /A /C /S ,S /A / IU} ,  F(c )  = {C},andR = {F ,Bs ,FP} .C la im 1 a i b i e' ~L (G1) for i > 0.Proof For any i.
> O~ we can find a corresponding categorialstring for a' b' c' : A '  (S /A /C  /S ) i - t (S  /A /C )C '  .
A reduction to S is straightforward.
\[\]Let gb~ (a)  denote the number of occurrences of a in stringw.Cla im 2 For all w ~ V T *, if w E L ( G I) thenCw(a)  = ~ (b) = ~,0 (c).Proof First, it is ea~sy to see that from the lexical categories, wecannot get any complex category headed by either A or C, and wecan get atomic category symbol A or C only directly from thelexicon.Second, each morpheme b would introduce one A and one Cwithin a complex category symbol which must be cancelh~l outsooner or later in order to reduce the whole string to S.  In general, there are two ways for such A and C being cancelled: (1)with an A headed or C headed complex category by the FPrule, which is impossible in this example; (2) with a single atomiccategory A or C by either the F or P, s rule.
We have seen thatsuch single A and C can only be introduced by the morpheme aand c, respectively.
So 4) w (a) ::= q~,0 (b) = ~b w (c).\[\]To show that L (G 1) is not context free, we take its intersection with the regtl\]ar language a*b:~c :~ .
\]?,y claim 1 and 2, the intersection is exactly the laugu;Lge {an b" c ~' \] n > 0} which iswell known to be non context free.
Since the intersection of acontext free language with a regular set must be conte.xt free,L (GI) cannot be context free.tq{OCESSORSA categorial grammar is certainly no worse than contextsensitive.
We can verify this by using a noudctermiuisticlinear bounded auLomatoll to model the reduction process.
Foreven in the case of reduction by the unrestricted l,'P rule, thecategory symbol obtained by reduction is shorter than the cornbiqed length of the two inputs t,o 1he rule.Ades and Steedman \[1\] propose a processor that is a pushdown stack automaton and pushdown stack automata areknown to correspond to the context free languages.
Itow can wereconcile this with the cnntext sensitive example abow~?
Thecontradiction arises because the stack of their processor must beable to contain any derived eal~egory symbol of DA, and thus thesize of the stack symbols is unlimited.
The processor is thus nota pushdowrl autoulaton in the usual sense.Ael~nowh~(lg~;mnt- ~?V~w-,ould like to thank t~amarathnam Venkatesau and Remko Scha for he.lpful discussions o1" lhe material.This work wa.s supported in part by National Science FoundationGrant No.
