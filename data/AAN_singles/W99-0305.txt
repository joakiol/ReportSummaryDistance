de/~mkleinAbst ractThis paper describes the state of the art of codingschemes for dialogue acts and the efforts to estab-lish a standard in this field.
We present a reviewand comparison of currently available schemes andoutline the comparison problems we had due to do-main, task, and language dependencies of schemes.We discuss olution strategies which have in mindthe reusability of corpora.
Reusability is a cru-cial point because production and annotation ofcorpora is very time and cost consuming but thecurrent broad variety of schemes makes reusabilityof annotated corpora very hard.
The work of thispaper takes place in the framework of the Euro-pean Union funded MATE project.
MATE aimsto develop general methodological guidelines forthe creation, annotation, retrieval and analysis ofannotated corpora.INTRODUCTIONOver the last years, corpus based approaches havegained significant importance in the field of natu-ral language processing (NLP).
Large corpora formany different languages are currently being col-lected all over the world, like?
\[British National Corpus\],?
\[The TRAINS Spoken Dialogue Corpus\], or?
\[The Child Language Data\].In order to use this amount of data for training andtesting purposes of NLP systems, corpora have tobe annotated in various ways by adding, for exam-ple, prosodic, syntactic, or dialogue act informa-tion.
This annotation assumes an underlying cod-ing scheme.
The way such schemes are designeddepends on the task, the domain, and the linguis-tic phenomena on which developers focus.
The au-thor's own style and scientific background also hasits effects on the scheme.
So far, standardisation inthe field of dialogue acts is missing and reusabilityof annotated corpora in various projects is com-plicated.
On the other hand reusability is neededto reduce the costs of corpus production and an-notation time.The participating sites of the EU sponsoredproject MATE (Multi level Annotation Tools En-gineering) reviewed the world-wide approaches,available schemes \[Klein et al1998\], and toolson spoken dialogue annotation \[Isard et ai.1998\].The project builds its own workbench of inte-grated tools to support annotation, evaluation,statistical analysis and mapping between differ-ent formats.
MATE also aims to develop a pre-liminary form of standard concerning annotationschemes on various levels to support he reusabil-ity of corpora and schemes.In this paper we focus on the level of dia-logue acts.
We outline the results of the com-parison of the reviewed coding schemes based on\[Klein et al1998\] and discuss best practice tech-niques for annotation of mass data on the levelof dialogue acts.
These techniques are consideredas a first step towards a standard on the level ofdialogue acts.COMPARISON OF CODINGSCHEMESPlenty of research as been done in the field of an-notation schemes and many schemes for differentpurposes exist.
Not all of these schemes can be an-notated reliably and are suitable for reuse.
In thefollowing we state guidelines we have developed forselecting most appropriate schemes and representthe results of our scheme comparison according tothese guidelines.Firstly, it is important for us that there is acoding book provided for a scheme.
Without def-35inition of a tag set, decision trees, and annotationexamples, a scheme is hard to apply.
Also thescheme has to show that it is easy to handle whichmeans it should have been successfully used by areasonable number of annotators on different lev-els of expertise.
For reusability reasons, language,task, and domain independence is required.
Ad-ditionally, it is crucial that the scheme has beenapplied to large corpora.
The annotation of massdata is the best indicator for the usability of ascheme.
Finally, it was judged positive if schemesdirectly proved their reliability by providing a nu-merical evaluation of inter-coder agreement, e.g.the ~-value \[Carletta1996\].Information about schemes was collected fromthe world wide web, from recent proceedings andthrough personal contact.
We compared 16 dif-ferent schemes, developed in the UK, Sweden, theUS, Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany.
Mostof these schemes were applied to English languagedata.
Only three of the reviewed schemes wereannotated in corpora of more than one language,and thus, indicate some language independence.A drawback in reusing schemes for differentpurposes is tailoring them to a certain domain ortask.
Nevertheless, most of the ongoing projects incorpus annotation look at two-agent, ask-orienteddialogues, in which the participants collaborate tosolve some problem.
These facts are also reflectedin the observed schemes which were all designedfor a certain task and/or used in a specific domain.With regard to the evaluation guidelinesstated above we can positively mention that allschemes provide coding books.
Also, all schemeswere applied to corpora of reasonable size (10 K- 16 MB data).
In 14 cases expertised annotatorswere employed to apply the schemes which leadsto the assumption that these schemes are ratherdifficult to use.
The inter-coder agreement, givenby 10 of the schemes, shows intermediate to goodresults.The comparison of tag sets was performeddifferently with regard to higher and lower or-der categories.
The definition of higher ordercategories was mainly driven by the linguistic,e.g.
\[Sacks and Schegloff1973\], and/or philosoph-ical theories, e.g.
\[Searle1969\], the schemes werebased on.
Whereas definitions and descriptionsof lower order categories were influenced by theunderlying task the scheme was designed for, e.g.information retrieval, and the domain of the cor-pus the scheme was applied to, e.g.
conversationbetween children.The only higher order aspect hat was implic-itly or explicitly covered in all schemes was for-ward and backward looking functionality.
Thismeans that a certain dialogue segment is relatedto a previous dialogue part, like a "RESPONSE",or to the following dialogue part, like a "CLAIM"that forces a reaction from the dialogue partner.On the level of lower order tags we could seetags?
with nearly equivalent definitions, e.g.- the dialogue act "REQUEST" definition in D.Traum's scheme:"The speaker aims to get the hearer to per-form some action.
"\[Traum1996\]compared to- the dialogue act "RA" definition in S. Condon& C. Cech's scheme:"Requests for action function to indicatethat the speaker would like the hearer(s)to do something \[...\]"\[Condon and Cech1995\]compared to- the dialogue act "REQUEST" definition inthe VERBMOBIL scheme:"If you realise that the speaker requestssome action from the hearer \[...\] you usethe dialogue act REQUEST"\[Alexandersson et a1.1998\];?
which broadly seem to cover the same featurewith slightly different description facettes, e.g.- the dialogue act "OPEN-OPTION" definitionin the DAMSL scheme:"It suggests a course of action but puts noobligation to the listener.
"\[Allen and Core1997\]compared with the examples above;?
which differ completely from the rest, e.g.- the dialogue act "UPDATE" definition in theLINLIN scheme:"where users provide information to thesystem"\[Dahlb~ck and JSnsson1998\]- -  addressed to human-machine dialogues.Especially the last group can be interpreted ashighly task or domain dependent.3 6HOW TO ACHIEVE ASTANDARDThere are several possibilities, how standardisa-tion on the level of dialogue acts can be achieved.One possibility is to develop a single, very gen-eral scheme.
Our impression is, that such anew scheme which has not proven usability isnot going to be accepted by researchers whowant to look at a certain phenomena of interest.The CHAT scheme used in the CHILDES system\[MacWhinney\], for example, distinguishes 67 dif-ferent dialogue acts - -  it is very unlikely that ageneral scheme would fit all of their requirementsconcerning children's conversation.Another possibility is to provide a set of cod-ing schemes for several purposes.
These alreadyexisting coding schemes must hold the conditionthat they have proven reliability in mass data an-notation.
As there cannot exist a scheme for everypurpose, this approach only serves developers ofnew schemes who want to get an idea how to pro-ceed.
With regard to the problem of standardisa-tion this solution is very unsatisfiable as mappingbetween schemes is often impossible, if schemesdo not have a common ground, like the SLSAscheme that models feedback and own communica-tion management \[Nivre t al.1998\], and the AL-PARON scheme \[van Vark and de Vreught1996\]with the primary objective to analyse the previ-ously mentioned ialogues to model informationtransfer.The Discourse Resource Initiative (DRI)group provided input on a third possibility: De-veloping best practice methods for scheme design,documentation a d annotation.Scheme Des ignWe can classify the existing schemes in two cat-egories: multi-dimensional and single-dimensionalschemes.Multi-dimensional schemes are based onthe assumption that an utterance covers sev-eral different orthogonal aspects, called dimen-sions.
Each dimension can be labeled.
DAMSL\[Allen and Core1997\], for instance, is a schemethat implements a four dimensional hierarchy.These dimensions are tailored to two-agent, ask-oriented, problem-solving dialogues.
Suggested di-mensions are?
Communicative Status which records whetheran utterance is intelligible and whether it was37successfully completed,?
In\]ormation Level which represents the seman-tic content of an utterance on an abstract level,?
Forward Looking Function which describes howan utterance constraints the future beliefs andactions of the participants, and affects the dis-course, and?
Backward Looking Function which characterizeshow an utterance relates to the previous dis-course.Single-dimensional schemes consist of one sin-gle list of possible labels.
Their labels belongbasically to what is called Forward and Back-ward Looking Functions in DAMSL.
Apart fromDAMSL all observed schemes belong to this cate-gory.Comparing both categories, the multi-di-mensional approach is more linguistically moti-vated presenting a clear modeling of theoreti-cal distinctions; but annotation experiments haveshown that it takes more effort to apply them thanit is for single-dimensional schemes.
On  the otherhand, although a single-dimensional scheme is eas-ier to annotate it is hard to judge from outsidewhat kind of phenomena such a scheme tries tomodel as dimensions are merged -- a major dis-advantage if reusability is considered.
An  examplefor a dialogue act that merges DAMSL 's  backwardand forward looking function is the "CHECK"move in the Map Task scheme.
"A CHECK moverequests the partner to confirm information thatthe speaker has some reason to believe, but is notentirely sure about" \[Carletta et al1996\].
This re-flects the forward looking aspect of such a dia-logue act.
"However, CHECK moves are almostalways about some information which the speakerhas been told" \[Carletta et al1996\] -- a descrip-tion that models the backward looking functional-ity of a dialogue act.Our suggestion to tackle the problem of whatkind of scheme is most appropriate, is to usesingle- and multi-dimensional schemes in parallel.The developer of a new scheme is asked to thinkprecisely what kind of phenomena will be exploredand what kind of tags are needed for this pur-pose.
These tags have to be classified with regardto the dimension they belong to.
The theoreticalmulti-dimensional scheme will then be applied tosome test corpora.
The example annotation showswhich tags are less used than others and whichtag combinations often occur together.
Based onthis information the scheme designer can derive aflattened single-dimensional version of the multi-dimensional scheme.
The flattened or mergedscheme is used for mass data-annotation.
A map-ping mechanism has to be provided to convert acorpus from its surface structure, annotated us-ing the single-dimensional scheme to the internalstructure, annotated using the multi-dimensionalscheme.
The multi-dimensional scheme can easilybe reused and extended by adding a new dimen-sion.
Furthermore, the corpus annotated with themulti-dimensional scheme is not any longer taskdependent.Scheme Documentat ionEach coding scheme should provide a coding bookto be applicable.
Such a document is needed tohelp other researchers to understand why a tagset was designed in the way it is.
Therefore theintroduction part of a coding book should statethe purpose, i.e.
task and domain, the scheme isdesigned for, the kind of information that has beenlabeled with regard to the scheme's purpose, andthe theory the scheme is based on.For detailed information about a tag, a tag setdefinition is required.
Following \[Carletta1998\],such a definition should be mutual exclusive andunambiguous sothat the annotator finds it easy toclassify a dialogue segment as a certain dialogueact.
Also the definition should be intention-basedand hence easy to understand and to remember,so that the annotator does not have to consultthe coding book permanently even after using thescheme for quite a while.We suggest, that a coding book should con-tain a decision tree that aims to give an overviewof all possible tags and how they are related toeach other.
Additionally, the decision tree has tobe supplemented by rules that help to navigatethrough the tree.
For each node in the tree thereshould be a question which states the conditionthat has to be fulfilled in order to go to a lowerlayer in the tree.
If no further condition holds, thecurrent node (or leaf) in the tree represents themost appropriate tag.
As an example of a sub-tree plus decision rules see Figure 1, taken from\[Alexandersson et ai.1998\].Decision CONTROL_DIALOGUE:if the segment isused to open a dialogue by greet-ing a dialogue partnerthen label with GREETelse i f  the segment is used to close a dialogueby saying good-bye to a dialogue partner thenlabel with BYE.else i f  the segment contains the introduction ofthe speaker, i.e.
name, title, associated com-pany etc.
label with INTRODUCEelse i f  the segment is used to perform an actionof politeness like asking about the partner'sgood health or formulating compliments labelwith POLITENESS_FORMULAelse if the segment is used to express grati-tude towards the dialogue partner label withTHANKelse i f  the segment is used to gain dialoguetime by thinking aloud or using certain for-mulas label with DELIBERATEelse i f  the segment is used to signal under-standing (i.e.
acknowledging intact commu-nication) label with BACKCHANNELCONTROL_DIALOGUEGREETBYEINTRODUCE/ POLITENESS_FORMULATHANK\ DELIBERATEBACKCHANNELFigure 1Examples should complement the scheme'sdescription.
These examples hould present ordi-nary but also problematic and more difficult casesof annotation.
The difficulties should be brieflyexplained.Experiences have shown that for new coderstag set definitions are most important o get anunderstanding of schemes.
Annotation examplesserve as a starting point to get a feeling for an-notation but to manage the annotation task, deci-sion trees are used until coders are experiencedenough to perform annotation without using acoding book.
This shows how important hesethree components of a coding book are in order to38Jgive new annotators or other scientists best sup-port to understand and apply a coding scheme.To interpret he evaluation results of inter-coder agreement in the right way, the coding pro-cedure that was used for annotation should bementioned.
Such a coding procedure covers, forexample, how segmentation f a corpus is per-formed, if multiple tagging is allowed and if so,is it unlimited or are there just certain combina-tions of tags not allowed, is look ahead permitted,etc..For further information on coding procedureswe want to refer to \[Dybkjmr et al1998\] and forgood examples of coding books see, for example,\[Carletta etal.1996\], \[Alexandersson et al1998\],or \[Thym~-Gobbel and Levin1998\].Annotation SupportAnother criterion which is important o in-crease the effectiveness of annotation is us-ing a user-friendly annotation tool.
Such atool also guarantees consistency, as typing er-rors are avoided and, hence, improves the qual-ity of annotated corpora.
This issue is ad-dressed by the MATE workbench.
Other, al-ready existing tools are the ALEMBIC Workbenchby \[The Mitre Corporation\], NB by \[Flammia\],or FRINGE used in the FESTIVAL system by\[The Centre for Speech Technology Research\].D IALOGUE ACT LEVELREAL ISAT ION IN  MATEThe approach in MATE is to reuse the DAMSLscheme as an example for an internal multi-dimensional scheme and a variant of the SWBD-DAMSL scheme \[Jurafsky et al1997\] as its exam-ple flattened surface counterpart.
SWBD-DAMSLwas derived from the original DAMSL scheme us-ing the techniques described above.
Unfortunatelysome additional tags were added so that an exactmapping from one scheme to the other is not pos-sible any more.
For this reason the MATE SWBD-DAMSL variant omits these additional tags.MATE uses XML \[The W3Ca\], a widely ac-cepted interchange and storage format for struc-tured textual data, to represent the schemes andthe annotated corpora.Stylesheets (a subset of XSL \[The W3Cb\]) areused as a mapping mechanism between corporaannotated with the surface scheme and corporaannotated with the internal scheme.39The choice in MATE to use the W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium) proposals i because XMLis the latest, most flexible data exchange formatcurrently available and strongly supported by in-dustry.
XSL supplements XML insofar that it re-alises the formatting of an XML document.The facilities for dialogue act annotation areembedded in the MATE workbench.
The work-bench is currently being implemented in Java 1.2as a platform independent approach.
This makesthe distribution process of the workbench easierand supports wide-spreading MATE's ideas of bestpractice in annotation.RELATED WORKProjects which are related to MATE's aim to de-velop a preliminary form of standard concerningannotation schemes are the DR/which was startedas an effort to assemble discourse resources tosupport discourse research and application.
Thegoal of this initiative is to develop a standardfor semantic/pragmatic nd discourse features ofannotated corpora \[Carletta etal.1997\].
Anotherproject, LE-EAGLES, also has the goal to pro-vide preliminary guidelines for the representa-tion or annotation of dialogue resources for lan-guage ngineering \[Leech et al1998\].
These guide-lines cover the areas of orthographic transcription,morpho-syntactic, syntactic, prosodic, and prag-matic annotation.
LE-EAGLES describes mostused schemes, markup languages, and systems forannotation rather than proposing standards.CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORKHaving reviewed alarge amount of currently avail-able coding schemes for dialogue acts we pre-sented amethodology how to tackle the standard-isation problem.
We outlined best practice forscheme and coding book design which hopefullywill lead to a better understanding and reusabil-ity of schemes and corpora annotated using theproposed method.Our approach is currently being implementedin the MATE workbench and will be tested andenhanced in the remaining time of the project.
Itwill be applied to the CSELT, Danish DialogueSystem, CHILDES, MAPTASK and VERBMO-BIL corpus to help making it as task, domain andlanguage independent as possible.
Inadequaciesduring the testing phase which are related to theinternal scheme we use will be discussed with themembers ofthe DRI to further improve the schemeor its flattened variant.ACKNOWLEDGMENTI would like to thank the members of the DRIfor stimulating and fruitful discussions and sugges-tions, and Norbert Reithinger, Jan Alexandersson,and Michael Kipp who gave valuable feedback onthis paper.The work described here is part of the Euro-pean Union funded MATE LE Telematics ProjectLE4-8370.References\[Alexandersson et a1.1998\] J.
