ACTIVE  SCHENATAAND THEIR  POLEIN SEMANTIC  PARSINGJ oach im H.Laubsch  D ie tmar  ~.RoesnerIns t i tu t  fuer  In fo rmat ik  Mathemat isches  Ins t i tu t  AUn ivers i taet  S tut tgar tD-7000 Stut tgar tWest  GermanyAbstractIn the past years we have been applying semanticATN-grammars - as introduced by Brown & Burton(1974) - to natural language question-answeringtasks (e.g.
a LISP-Tutor \[Barth, 1977\], squestion-answering system about the micro-worldof soccer \[Rathke & Sonntag, 1979\]).
We foundthat semantic grammars execute efficiently, butbecome large very quickly even with moderatedomains of discourse.
We therefore looked forways to support parsing by domain-dependentknowledge represented in an inheritance network\[Lauhsch,IQTQT.
In this paper we first brieflydescribe our representation language Ohjtalk,and then illustrate how it is used for buildingan understanding system for processing Germannewspaper texts about the jobmarket situation.keywords: newspaper processing, ATN, framessemantic grammar, object-orientedprogramming, 0hj~alkConcepts as active schemataWe have developped an object-orientedrepresentation language called 0bjTalk - inwhich objects are frame-like data structureswhich have behavioral traits and communicatethrough message passing.
The objects (classesand instances) are organized into a (multiple)inheritance hierarchy.
0bjTalk is an extensionto Lisp and was inspired by SMALLTAL~\[Goldberg&~ay, 1976\], VRL \[~oberts&Coldstein,1977\], and KLONE \[Braehman, 1978\].An inheritance net of objects (with the rootclass Object) is constructed by sending themessage NEW: to the class CLASS, i.e.
a conceptdefinition in ObjTalk has the form:(ASK CLASS NEW: <concept-name>SUPERC (<concept-name1>...)GENERIC-PROPERTIES<slot-name>: <filler-description>ME~HODS<method-name>: \[<filter> => <body>\]~RIGCER-ATN<Trigger-keys> ; attached ATN\[<subATN-node> <production>\]...)The effect of sending NEW: to CLASS is to definea class with the given <concept-name> as asubclass of the named superelass(es).
Instancesare made by sending the concept a message thatcauses to fill its slots with fillers whichsatisfy the filler description.
If an objectreceives a message, this will be matched againstthe method-filters.
In case of success thecorresponding method's body will be evaluated.Concepts inherit methods and generic propertiesfro~ their superclass(es) recursively upto theroot node Object (which implements thesystem-defined messages).
Objects may be furtherspecified dynamically by adding slots ormethods, or filling slots.For schema-driven parsing, a semantic suhATNshould be activated whenever a particular wordis found, or concept is expected.
The basicmechanism is to attach trigger-key8 to a schemathat state which words364--which words or concepts make a schema active.Once active it puts the named subATN-nodes in apreferred aetivatable state.
The ATN-machine hasbeen extended to prefer PUSH arcs fromnon-deterministic states if they areactivatable.
This is implemented by primitivesfor activating a subATN, deactivating an activeone, and a test for activation.The suhATNs of the trigger-atn form (or thoseones in filler descriptions) are madeactivatable if(I) a concept has been partially instantiated(an instance of this concept or one lower inthe hierarchy was made, but not all obligatoryroles are filled), or(2) one of the concepts mentioned intrigger-keys has been instantiated, or(5) one of the words mentioned in triggerMys was found by the scanner.Arc actions of the ATN may send messages toconcepts, and thus (partially) instantiate aconcept.Application to newspaperunderstandingWe are currently applying ObjTalk tounderstanding newspaper reports about thejohmarket situation.
Reports of this kind arehighly stereotypical: They describe the presentjobmarket situation in terms of a few attributesand their respective changes.
These indicatorsare interpreted and discussed within theframework of a simple model of jobmarketfluctuations by officials of the issuingorganization.
Sometimes the data are alsocommented upon by political speakers ofdifferent views.Jobmarket reports are prototypical for related"official statistical reports" (e.g.developments of population, crime, stockmarketetc.).
These articles are differing in structureand contents (data, values, changes,explanantions, interpretations) from the more"event"-oriented newspaper-texts of DeJongs~RI~P \[Iq79\] and Cullingfords SAM \[1978\].~he knowledge-baseWe have built a knowledge-base of (ObjTalk-)concepts in order to proess news articles ofthis type.
The design was guided by theprinciple of providing an active schema foreverything that would be considered a "thema" inthe reports.The most global frame is the one for"job-market-situation" (jms).
It combines in itsroles all what would "normally" be reported inour texts and should therefore be expected bythe system: time, region, relevant aspects orindicators - i.e.
jobless-rate, open-jobs, newemployments ... - , explanations for the generalsituation, general predictions.
(Think of ajms-frame as a "snapshot" of thejobmarket-developments; Schankian people maythink of it as analoguous to a script).The relevant aspects are in a sense constitutingthe jms, technically spoken: are in a part-ofrelation to the jms-frame.
Their framesthemselves are combined from frames for thestatic and the dynamic part of thejobmarket-factor,i.e, an index- and anindex-change-frame.
Each concept for anindividual jobmarket-aspect also involvesencoded knowledge for a (specificl evaluation,explanation and prediction.The common traits of the individual jm-indicesare organized in the jm-index-frsme, whichitself inherits knowledge (slots,...) from amore general index-frame that combines theshared traits of all such indices (cf.
above).This organization should later allow easyextension of the system.ExamplesParsing the sentence"DIE ZAHL DER ARBEITSLOSEN YN ENGLAND IST IMMAY UM 14000 AU~ 1,509 MILLIONENZURUECKGEGANGEN"("THE ~MBER OF I~EMPLOYED PERSONS IN ENGLANDHAS DECREASED YN MAY BY 14000 TO 1,509 MILLYON")would cause the following instances to becreated and included into the static and dynamicroles of the resp.
jm-sspect:365-jobless-index-1 = ( a jobless-index withregion: (England)value: (I.~09 million)time: (DATE ~I 5 80)sex: (AND MALE FEMALE)jobtypes: (ALL JOBTYPES)changes: change-jobless-index-1?
, .
)change-jobless-index-1 = ( a change-of-indexwithref.-index: jobless-index-1time-new: (DATE ~I 5 80)time-old: (DATE ~O 4 80)time-interval: (DATE-YNT 5 80)value-new: (~.5Oq million)value-old: (1.52~ million)change-abs: (-14000)change-qual: (DECREASE)evaluation: (POSITIVE)?
.
,  )(The last inference is done by a method of classjobless-index which says that for this indexDECREASE is evaluated positively; this rule doesof course not hold for e.g.
theopen-jobs-index).Schemata for argumentationsStatements about facts are often followed byexplanations given by an official person.
Suchstatements are recognized and dealt with by aschema called "interpretation" which isactivatable e.g.
by verbs like the German"erklaeren" ("declare").The interpretation schema has as roles:fact: (OR (CLASS jm-indicator)(CLASS jm-situation)~speaker:~(CLASS official/person)object: (CLASS explanatory/statement)The object of an interpretation is anexplanatory statement, which has roles for amanifest fact and supporting reasons.
The systemhas an elementary knowledge about (jm-specific)economic dependencies (e.g.
decrease in thejobless rate in the time interval from March toMay may be due to seasonal effects), and usesthis to identify resp.
utterances as reasons inan explanatory statement.Guiding ATN control through schemataThe kernel of our grammar consists of semanticATNs particular to role fillers of (0bjTalk-~concepts.
In general, the parser tries to usethe most specific subATN possible, and onlyfalls back onto a syntactic subnet if noexpectations are active.The semantic subATNs may be rather idiosyncratic(like the one for NP/jobmarket/official/personto handle phrases like "DER PRAESID~NT DERBUNDESANSTALT ~\[~R ARBEIT IN NUERNBERG, JOSEFSTINGL ...") and are organized hierarchically.They may be used by diverse concepts withsimilar slots.
The value returned via the POParc of a subnet may be used directly as fillerfor the triggering slot.
A more generalinterface between the ATN results and the slotsof a schema is provided by the productions inthe trigger-atn form.
The production filters outthose parts of an ATN result that fit asrole-fillers of the concept.Writing semantic ATNs is simplified by thechance to specify only one generic PUSH arc(e.g.
NP) that processes a class, instead of thepossibly large set of more specific ~\[SHes (e.g.NP/PERSON, NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON, NP/JOBMARKET/OFFICIAL/PERSON, ...).If the parser is in the starting state of such ageneric PUSH and a schema is active whose rolesare to be filled by semantic subATNs, then thosestanding in subclass relation to the genericPUSH are preferred.
E.g., if an unfilled slotexpects a N~/0FFICIAL/PERSON, and the parserexpects a NP, then, since NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON isa specialisation of NP, it is activated and - incase of success - the result is used to fillthat slot.In general, several schemata can be active at atime, in the sense that some of their slots areunfilled.
(In other words: There may be several"thematic expectations" looking for furtherinformation in the article).
Then all of theattached subATNs are activatable.
It is possiblethat an expected subATN succeeds but the resultfails to meet a fil ler-restriction (or even doesnot match the production).
This is treated likea failure of the subATN itself.--366--An informal parseThe following example - slightly shortened froma real news note - is intended to give a flavorof how knowledge base and parser processescooperate in analysing a johmarket report:>>DIE ZAHL DER ARBEIT~LOSEN ..(The number of unemployed ..)This triggers the concept for a jobless-indexand, since there is no one active yet,instantiates a jobmarket-situation as contextfor further processing.
Within it, thejobless-index becomes the static part of thereap.
jms-aspect-frame.>> .. VERRINGERTE SICH .. (.. decreased ..)An instance of change-of-index forjobless-index is created (because verbs like"decrease" are attached to index-changes) andidentified as the expected dynamic part of thestill active jms-aspect.>> .. LASSE KEINE KON~JNKTURELLEN AUFTRIEBS-KRAE~TE MEHR ERMENNEN, ..(.. does not show any signs of economicrecovery, ..)Since the manifest fact may be explained byeconomic recovery or other reasons, the intentof this statement is to exclude the formerexplanation.
The exclusion of a reason activatesa more general argumentation schema which nowdemands that a positive explanation must follow(at least in well written texts).>> .. DER RUECKCANC DER ARBEITSLOSICWEIT SEI NURAUF SAISONALE E IN~JESSE ZURUECKZUFUEHREN.(..
the decrease in jobless rate is onlycaused by seasonal influences.
)The first part repeats the manifestation (andis  optional), and the second part claimsseasonal effects as reason for it.
~hisexplanation is confirmed by one of our inferencerules ( time-interval is May ) about therelations between season and changes injobmarket-indices.
This finally allows to fillthe reason slot of the explanatory statement.>> ..
IN MAI i~ 58000 AUF 766000.(..
in may by q8000 to 766000.
)Various unfilled slots in the activejobless-index and change-of-index schemas arefilled by successfully processed particularPP-nets attached to those slots (e.g.PP/TIME-INT for time-intemral), some slots gettheir default values, which reflect newspaperconventions of "what is known without havingbeen said" (e.g.
the region slot gets "westerngermany" ) .>>DER PRAESIDENT DER BI~DESANSTALT FUER ARBEIm,JOSEPH ST!NGL, ERKLAERTE ...(The president of the federal employmentoffice, J.S., declared ...)This leads to the instantiation of aninterpretation frame (which itself will fill theexplanation slot of the jms-aspect) with thenamed official filling the speaker slot, andmakes thus a schema for an explanatory statementactive.
Slots to be filled here are amanifestation and reasons.>> ..
DIE ENTWICKLUNC AM ARBEITSMARZT ..(.. the development on the jobmarket ..)This refers to the previously built change ofjobless-index (as - by default - central aspectof jms-developments and - in this context - only"development" talked about so far\].
