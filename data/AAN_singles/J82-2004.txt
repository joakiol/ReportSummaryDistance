Woods, Bolt, Beranek and Newman3.1 IntroductionThe panel on concept extraction from natural lan-guage text defined a variety of different views on theproblem at issue.
First, we considered what would bethe properties of a very powerful natural languageunderstanding system which would serve as an ulti-mate model for our deliberations, but was clearly notachievable within the five-year time frame specified asthe primary area of interest to the Navy for the pur-poses of this workshop.
However, it could serve as agoal toward which progress could be made in a seriesof approximations, beginning within the next fiveyears and extending beyond.The "ult imate" system we envisioned was a modelfor understanding the text of scientific and technicalliterature in order to discover technological innova-tions, discern evolution of technological trends, andpredict where science and technology will evolve inthe future.
Such a system would consist of two majorcomponents:1.
Natural language understanding expert(s), whosetask would be to read and assimilate the narrativetext of scientific and technical literature.2.
Science and technology analysis expert(s), whosefunction would be to evaluate the content of indi-vidual articles as well as the cumulative contents ofthe collection of scientific and technical materials,and to identify trends and innovations, using mod-els of current developments in science and technol-ogy that define what would constitute an innova-tion, a trend, etc., and that specify a variety ofother rather inexplicit types of knowledge used byhuman experts to evaluate and predict.With this lofty goal somewhat vaguely identified as aHoly Grail for the future, we concentrated our effortson defining approximations to that goal, selecting asour focus the military message analysis and routingproblem presented by NRL personnel as representativeof a particular set of problems the Navy is currentlyattempting to solve.
Within this context, the paneladdressed two types of development issues:1.
How to manage the evolution of a type of systembased on existing message routing technology to araore capable, knowledge-based system within thenext five years.2.
How to manage the evolution of the next genera-tion knowledge- based system for message rout ingfrom the last development s age reached in (1).These two stages of development are discussed in Sec-tions 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.3.2 The Next  Five Yearsl\[n planning the evolutionary development of exist-ing military message routing systems into more capa-ble, knowledge-based systems within the next fiveyears, the panel considered a variety of techniques andapproaches that might be added to existing systems toaugment he current level of capability and "grow" thesystem in the direction of a more powerful naturallanguage processing model.There are two experimental development methodswhich could be used to achieve this goal.
The firstwould be to begin with an actual operational messagerouting system, install some version of this system atNRL as an experimental vehicle 2 and use it as a basisto build on, adding the components which provide theincremental capabilities discussed below, and systemat-ically evaluating the effect of the additional capabili-tie,~.
An alternate approach would be to construct afirst stage experimental message routing system with-out using any existing system as a foundation andproceeding as indicated above.1 For example, the predecessor company of Logicon's Operat-ing System Division - Operating Systems, Inc. (OSI) - built avariety of such systems for several different computer configura-tions.
Since these systems were constructed under governmentcontract, they are available at cost to the government.70 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April- June 1982Christine Montgomery Concept Extraction3.2.1 First Stage: Add State-of-the-Art CLComponentsThe initial stage of improved capabil ity can beachieved by incorporating into the basic message rout-ing system described above several state-of-the artcomputational linguistic components which are almostcharacterizable as "off-the-shelf".
Specifically, theseinclude a spelling corrector, a morphological analyzer,and a synonym generator.
The spelling correctorwould be of a type similar to the capability currentlyavailable under the UNIX operating system, tailoredfor the Navy message routing application (that is, in-cluding a variety of Naval acronyms, relevant propernouns such as place names and ship names, and otherspecial jargon terms).
Intelligent morphological ana-lyzers have been built for a number of natural lan-guage processing systems; these can be supplementedby current non-numeric processing techniques for par-tial match of character strings.+A synonym generator, on the other hand, whilewell within the state of the art, still requires develop-ment of the knowledge base of synonyms in somemanner.
To illustrate, suppose that the system mustautomatically produce for a user all the natural lan-guage synonyms for the terms in a routing profile orretrieval query of a user who wants all messages about"military aircraft in the vicinity of the Red Sea".
Inorder to generate the synonyms for each of thoseterms (which users should then be allowed to prune orsupplement as they prefer), the system must eitherhave been primed beforehand by an extensive develop-ment of a thesaurus-type knowledge base, or the sys-tem must have an ability to acquire such knowledgefrom users in an incremental manner (where the bur-den of developing the knowledge base of synonyms ismainly on the user), or a combination of both (for anillustration of the latter, see Katter and Montgomery1972).
23.2.2 Second Stage: Augment Key Word BasedConcept ExtractionThe second stage of improved capabil ity in thebasic message routing system would be achieved byaugmenting the current key word base content analysiscomponent in several steps.
It should be noted thatthese steps are based on the in-depth analysis of mes-sages and the routing environment described in Section3.3, which should thus be conducted in parallel withthe development of the first stage improvements dis-cussed in the preceding section.2 The operational message routing systems described in foot-note l allow users to develop synonym tables and utilize thoseproduced by others; however, these are not automatically triggeredwhen a routing profile is entered, but must be specifically requestedby the user.Content analysis of messages based on key wordsinvolves a rudimentary identification of concepts, withno attempt to identify relations between concepts.Thus a message reporting on shipments of cotter pinsfrom Cuba to Albania would not be distinguishablefrom a similar one reporting on shipments of cotterpins from Albania to Cuba.
Consequently, the initialstep in augmenting the ability of a message routingsystem to analyze the content of messages and extractconcepts from text would be the introduction of gram-mar rules and a syntactic analysis component.
A se-mantic grammar approach in which the categories ofthe grammar map fairly directly into user informationrequirements ments would constitute a productiveinitial capability.
Such a grammar could be built alongthe lines of the LIFER parser which was incorporatedinto LADDER (Burton 1976) specifically to answerquestions about ships at sea.A second development step in managing the evolu-tion of a key word based concept extraction system toa natural language understanding system involves theconstruction of taxonomic hierachies which providethe system with the knowledge to attempt rudimentaryinference, allow property inheritance, and exercisesome very simple analogic reasoning based on thetaxonomies.
The work of Woods on constructing andexploiting taxonomic hierarchies is illustrative of thistype of capability.
The methodology used by SRI'sNANOKLAUS system for organizing knowledge has asimilar basis (Haas and Hendrix 1980).A further enhacement would involve the utilizationof more general inference about the content of themessage (for example, rule based inference, where theconcept of rule includes frames and scripts as well asproduction rules).
Many messages relate informationabout some particular type of event that has occuredmany times before and will continue to occur, e.g., amissile or space launch.
Knowledge about the entitiesand relations involved in such an event can thereforebe codified in terms of rules or scripts which explicatethe expected contents of a message.
This provides thebasis on which the system can derive informationwhich is not explicity stated in the message and canidentify elements of information which are unexpectedor lacking.
The experimental message understandingsystem described in Silva et al 1979 is an example ofthis type of capability, as is the work of Simmons andChester (to apppear, 1982).The final developmental level deemed to be achiev-able within the next five years differs from the levelspreviously discussed in that it incorporates one type ofmeta-knowledge, that is, knowledge that is not con-cerned with the content of the messages, but with thegoals of the recipient of the message.
For example,the recipient may have gotten the message simply forinformation; on the other hand, the recipient may beAmerican Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April- June 1982 71Christine Montgomery Concept Extractionrequired to take some action on receiving the messagerather than merely filing it away, and the actions hemay take could be quite different depending on thecontent of the message (e.g., information that an ac-tivity has begun, or that an activity which has beengoing on for some time is continuing, or has ceased).Thus the consequences of the natural language under-standing failing to identify the type of content andcausing the message to be misrouted can be quite seri-ous in an operational environment.3.2.3 Third Stage: Provide for Coping with theLimitations of an Augmented Operational/Experimental SystemBefore the augmented message routing systemcould be used even experimental ly by persons otherthan its designers, it must have the means for dealingwith its own inadequancies.
Suppose the lexicallookup encounters a word which is not in the diction-ary, or the parser cannot analyze an input construc-tion, even though all the words are known.
Ap-proaches to solving the problem of unexpected inputsfall into two categories, and a robust system will incor-porate some partial solutions of both types.
The firsttype of approach involves what heuristics and otherreasoning strategies the system can attempt withoutappeal to the user; the second involves user interac-tion.What the system can do without appealing to theuser in the case of an unknown word ranges from:1. very simple heuristics which assume a misspellingand attempt to identify the word by partial matchstrategies, to2.
the complex strategy of utilizing a protype knowl-edge structure to deduce that the unknown wordmust be an entity of type x because it fits an other-wise unsatisfied slot in such a structure that re-quires an entity of type x.Some productive approaches to handling structuresthat are ungrammatical from the system's perspectiveinvolve systematically relaxing some of the grammati-cal constraints built in to the parser (e.g., subject /verbagreement),  as discussed in Weischedel and Black1980.In appealing to the user for assistance, a criticalfactor is supplying not only the right informationabout the particular failure, but the right amount ofinformation presented in words that the user can un-derstand, and with suggested remedial actions that aregeneral from the system perspective, not confusing tothe user, and unlikely to elicit erroneous inputs.
Ac-complishing all this is a non-trivial problem.3.3 The Next  GenerationAssuming that all these thorny problems of themessage routing system to be developed in the nextfive years are solved, the issue of managing the evolu-tion of the last stage of that system into somethingliike the powerful natural language understanding sys-tem described in Section 1 remains to be considered.An important part of this evolution, which wasalluded to above, is the specification of the two majorcomponents of such a system, namelyA.
A Natural  Language Understander,  which will bebased on a model of the universe of discourse rep-resented in the content of the messages;B.
A Message Routing Expert, which will be based ona model of Navy organizational and functionalstructure.\]n the following discussion, Section 3.3.1 describesthe research tasks for component (A), while Section3.3.2 treats the tasks for component (B).3.3.1 Research Tasks for the Natural LanguageUnderstanderIn order to provide for the evolution of the systemdescribed in the preceding section to a next genera-tion, knowledge based message routing system - aswell as to furnish basic information for the develop-ment to be achieved in the next five years - the initialresearch task should begin immediately, and the sec-ond research task should begin as early thereafter asfeasible.
The initial five year development effort doesnot depend on the remaining research tasks, which areaimed at the next generation system.
The researchtasks are described in the sections which follow.Message AnalysisThe initial task consists of an in-depth analysis ofthe domain of Navy messages that the routing systemmust handle.
The objective of the task is to providedetailed data on the content and format of the mes-sages, that is, information about the lexical items, jar-gon terms, classes of lexical items representing con-cepts, the concept hierarchy, the types of relationswhich can exist among concepts, the types of syntacticconstructs that those relations map into, and the dis-course structures of different types of messages.Tractability AnalysisThis research task will define three classes of mes-sages, in terms of their tractability to automated proc-essing, i.e., messages which are1.
Tractable for the initial stage of development(Section 3.2.1);2.
Tractable within the next five years (that is, tracta-ble at least in terms of the stage of system develop-ment described in Section 3.2.3);3.
Tractable in the future.72 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982Christine Montgomery Concept ExtractionSelection of Knowledge RepresentationSince this is one of the most debated aspects ofbuilding knowledge based systems, it seems unneces-sary to discuss it further here.
Any novices to thisissue will find Ron Brachman's SIGART 1980 surveyone of the more interesting recent attempts to docu-ment the thinking of various research groups on thesubject.
Moore's  thoughtful article on a theory oflogical forms for natural language expressions is re-freshing in that it focuses on the content rather thanthe form of knowledge representation (Moore 1981).Development of Knowledge Structures for MessageSubsetThis task involves the development of knowledgestructures for a selected subset of the universe of dis-course represented by the messages.
The task thusincorporates everal subtasks, all of which can be con-sidered as recommended research areas to be pursued.LexiconThe development of a lexicon for the message sub-language is a complex task because of the many acro-nyms and jargon terms used; some of these duplicatecommon English words, but with quite different mean-ings, (e.g.
"sinker",  as in "sub went sinker") and oth-ers must be analyzed in order to furnish appropriateinput to the parser and other system components (e.g.,"center spa 226k hawk 9 mi").
See the report of thePanel on Sublanguages for further details.Conceptual StructuresThis task involves the construction of appropriatehigher level conceptual structures (e.g., propositions,frames, scripts) which embody the intensional andextensional knowledge of the system.Inferential ComponentThe inferential component uses the system's knowl-edge base to derive implicit information, to generalizeand revise beliefs, and to attempt to understand theintentions of the actors whose actions are reported inthe messages.
The last area is an extremely complexone in which little research has been done.
Wilensky'swork on the goal-oriented behavior of actors in storiesis a notable contribution (Wilensky 1978).Discourse Analysis ComponentMost of the relevant issues for the subtask involv-ing definition of this component are covered in thepreceding papers in this article.
To recapitulate theseissues:?
tense/t ime?
anaphoric reference?
focus tracking (updating of short term memory)?
goal analysis (analysis of goals of actors in the mes-sage, goals of the originator of the message, andgoals of the recipient of the message)?
local and global inference, identifying discoursecoherence?
significance assessment (identifying the most impor-tant and/or  most salient concepts in the discourse,from the various goal-oriented perspectives men-tioned above)Integration of Knowledge Sources into a CoherentModelFinally, all the various sources of knowledge allud-ed to above must be integrated into a coherent modelof the message domain, which can be manipulated byanalytical procedures operating autonomously and inparallel, but under integrated control.3.3.2 Research Tasks for the Message RoutingExpertSimultaneously with the initial research task for theNatural Language Understander,  the first task de-scribed below should be initiated.Analysis of Selected Naval CommandAn organizational and functional analysis of a Na-val command selected as initial users for the near term(five year development system) must be performed inorder to understand in general terms the goals of mes-sage originators and recipients.Formalization of Expert Knowledge InvolvedThis task involves the detailed specification of thegoals of message originators and recipients.Relation of Content of Messages to Goals ofMessage UsersThe final task calls for the mapping of messagecontents to user goals and the definition of a mecha-nism to accomplish this routing function, which is thegoal of the systems described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 73
