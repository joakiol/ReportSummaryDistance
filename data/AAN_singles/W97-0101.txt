This use of statistical models was clearly inspired by the use of statisticalmethods for speech recognition, where self-organizing systems based on statistics are nowbeginning to achieve commercial success, and greatly outperform systems which attempt toexplicitly encode linguistic knowledge.
Many of the techniques used in statistical parsing deriverather directly from methods used for speech recognition; this is particularly true of methods fordealing with sparse data.Tiffs progress in parsing accuracy continues; within the last month, several new parsers have beenreported, two developed within the speaker's group at the University of Pennsylvania, which showdistinct improvement over the best parsing results of even a year ago.
Most surprisingly, each ofof these parsers incorporates a very different model, yet they perform similarly.This talk will argue that this progress in parsing, unlike the earlier progress in speech recognition,depends crucially on the combination of explicit linguistic representation and statisticalestimation.
I will claim that the reason these recent systems perform so similarly is that theyexplicitly encode very similar levels of linguistic representation.
Furthermore, ven in the use ofsmoothing techniques to deal with sparse data, paying close attention to underlyingrepresentational issues is often crucial; systems that utilize designer-encoded linguistic knowledgeabout representations currently significantly outperform representation-poor "self-organizing"smoothing methods.PART IIRecently, the executive committe of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) reacheda new vision of the structure and functioning of this organization; this talk will outline both thecurrent activities of the ACL and this new vision.
As part of this new vision, the ACL now seeksa structure that both creates a truly international ACL and that reflects the fact that here are strongregional interests and special circumstances.
To implement this in part, the ACL both will adopt aschedule of future annual meetings and applied natural language processing conferences that givesmuch wider geographic distribution to these meetings and will propose to its membership changesin the composition of the executive committee itself which better reflect the geographicaldistribution of activity in computational linguistics worldwide.
