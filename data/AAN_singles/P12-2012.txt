Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 60?64,Jeju, Republic of Korea, 8-14 July 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsSelf-Disclosure and Relationship Strength in Twitter ConversationsJinYeong Bak, Suin Kim, Alice OhDepartment of Computer ScienceKorea Advanced Institute of Science and TechnologyDaejeon, South Korea{jy.bak, suin.kim}@kaist.ac.kr, alice.oh@kaist.eduAbstractIn social psychology, it is generally acceptedthat one discloses more of his/her personal in-formation to someone in a strong relationship.We present a computational framework for au-tomatically analyzing such self-disclosure be-havior in Twitter conversations.
Our frame-work uses text mining techniques to discovertopics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns,as well as personally identifiable information(PII) and personally embarrassing information(PEI).
Our preliminary results illustrate that inrelationships with high relationship strength,Twitter users show significantly more frequentbehaviors of self-disclosure.1 IntroductionWe often self-disclose, that is, share our emotions,personal information, and secrets, with our friends,family, coworkers, and even strangers.
Social psy-chologists say that the degree of self-disclosure in arelationship depends on the strength of the relation-ship, and strategic self-disclosure can strengthen therelationship (Duck, 2007).
In this paper, we studywhether relationship strength has the same effect onself-disclosure of Twitter users.To do this, we first present a method for compu-tational analysis of self-disclosure in online conver-sations and show promising results.
To accommo-date the largely unannotated nature of online conver-sation data, we take a topic-model based approach(Blei et al, 2003) for discovering latent patterns thatreveal self-disclosure.
A similar approach was ableto discover sentiments (Jo and Oh, 2011) and emo-tions (Kim et al, 2012) from user contents.
Priorwork on self-disclosure for online social networkshas been from communications research (Jiang etal., 2011; Humphreys et al, 2010) which relieson human judgements for analyzing self-disclosure.The limitation of such research is that the data issmall, so our approach of automatic analysis of self-disclosure will be able to show robust results over amuch larger data set.Analyzing relationship strength in online socialnetworks has been done for Facebook and Twitterin (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009; Gilbert, 2012) andfor enterprise SNS (Wu et al, 2010).
In this paper,we estimate relationship strength simply based onthe duration and frequency of interaction.
We thenlook at the correlation between self-disclosure andrelationship strength and present the preliminary re-sults that show a positive and significant correlation.2 Data and MethodologyTwitter is widely used for conversations (Ritter et al,2010), and prior work has looked at Twitter for dif-ferent aspects of conversations (Boyd et al, 2010;Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al, 2011; Ritter et al,2011).
Ours is the first paper to analyze the degreeof self-disclosure in conversational tweets.
In thissection, we describe the details of our Twitter con-versation data and our methodology for analyzingrelationship strength and self-disclosure.2.1 Twitter Conversation DataA Twitter conversation is a chain of tweets wheretwo users are consecutively replying to each other?stweets using the Twitter reply button.
We identifieddyads of English-tweeting users who had at least60three conversations from October, 2011 to Decem-ber, 2011 and collected their tweets for that dura-tion.
To protect users?
privacy, we anonymized thedata to remove all identifying information.
Thisdataset consists of 131,633 users, 2,283,821 chainsand 11,196,397 tweets.2.2 Relationship StrengthResearch in social psychology shows that relation-ship strength is characterized by interaction fre-quency and closeness of a relationship betweentwo people (Granovetter, 1973; Levin and Cross,2004).
Hence, we suggest measuring the relation-ship strength of the conversational dyads via the fol-lowing two metrics.
Chain frequency (CF) mea-sures the number of conversational chains betweenthe dyad averaged per month.
Chain length (CL)measures the length of conversational chains be-tween the dyad averaged per month.
Intuitively, highCF or CL for a dyad means the relationship is strong.2.3 Self-DisclosureSocial psychology literature asserts that self-disclosure consists of personal information and opencommunication composed of the following five ele-ments (Montgomery, 1982).Negative openness is how much disagreementor negative feeling one expresses about a situationor the communicative partner.
In Twitter conver-sations, we analyze sentiment using the aspect andsentiment unification model (ASUM) (Jo and Oh,2011), based on LDA (Blei et al, 2003).
ASUMuses a set of seed words for an unsupervised dis-covery of sentiments.
We use positive and negativeemoticons from Wikipedia.org1.
Nonverbal open-ness includes facial expressions, vocal tone, bod-ily postures or movements.
Since tweets do notshow these, we look at emoticons, ?lol?
(laughingout loud) and ?xxx?
(kisses) for these nonverbal ele-ments.
According to Derks et al (2007), emoticonsare used as substitutes for facial expressions or vocaltones in socio-emotional contexts.
We also considerprofanity as nonverbal openness.
The methodologyused for identifying profanity is described in the nextsection.
Emotional openness is how much one dis-closes his/her feelings and moods.
To measure this,1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of emoticonswe look for tweets that contain words that are iden-tified as the most common expressions of feelings inblogs as found in Harris and Kamvar (2009).
Recep-tive openness and General-style openness are diffi-cult to get from tweets, and they are not defined pre-cisely in the literature, so we do not consider thesehere.2.4 PII, PEI, and ProfanityPII and PEI are also important elements of self-disclosure.
Automatically identifying these is quitedifficult, but there are certain topics that are indica-tive of PII and PEI, such as family, money, sick-ness and location, so we can use a widely-used topicmodel, LDA (Blei et al, 2003) to discover topicsand annotate them using MTurk2 for PII and PEI,and profanity.
We asked the Turkers to read the con-versation chains representing the topics discoveredby LDA and have them mark the conversations thatcontain PII and PEI.
From this annotation, we iden-tified five topics for profanity, ten topics for PII, andeight topics for PEI.
Fleiss kappa of MTurk resultis 0.07 for PEI, and 0.10 for PII, and those numberssignify slight agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).Table 1 shows some of the PII and PEI topics.
Theprofanity words identified this way include nigga,lmao, shit, fuck, lmfao, ass, bitch.PII 1 PII 2 PEI 1 PEI 2 PEI 3san tonight pants teeth familylive time wear doctor brotherstate tomorrow boobs dr sistertexas good naked dentist unclesouth ill wearing tooth cousinTable 1: PII and PEI topics represented by the high-ranked words in each topic.To verify the topic-model based approach to dis-covering PII and PEI, we tried supervised classifi-cation using SVM on document-topic proportions.Precision and recall are 0.23 and 0.21 for PII, and0.30 and 0.23 for PEI.
These results are not quitegood, but this is a difficult task even for humans,and we had a low agreement among the Turkers.
Soour current work is in improving this.2https://www.mturk.com61Sentiment0.260.280.300.320.340.36llll2 3 4l posnegneu Nonverbal openness0.000.050.100.15 llll2 3 4l emoticonlolxxx Emotionalopenness0.000.050.100.150.200.250.30llll2 3 4l joysadnessothersProfanity0.000.020.040.060.080.10llll2 3 4l profanityPII, PEI0.000.010.020.030.04llll2 3 4l PIIPEI(a) Chain FrequencySentiment0.260.280.300.320.340.36llllllll5 10 15 20 25l posnegneu Nonverbal openness0.000.050.100.15llllllll5 10 15 20 25l emoticonlolxxx Emotionalopenness0.000.050.100.150.200.250.30llllllll5 10 15 20 25l joysadnessothersProfanity0.000.020.040.060.080.10llllllll5 10 15 20 25l profanityPII, PEI0.000.010.020.030.04llllllll5 10 15 20 25l PIIPEI(b) Conversation LengthFigure 1: Degree of self-disclosure depending on various relationship strength metrics.
The x axis shows relationshipstrength according to tweeting behavior (chain frequency and chain length), and the y axis shows proportion of self-disclosure in terms of negative openness, emotional openness, profanity, and PII and PEI.3 Results and DiscussionsChain frequency (CF) and chain length (CL) reflectthe dyad?s tweeting behaviors.
In figure 1, we cansee that the two metrics show similar patterns ofself-disclosure.
When two users have stronger rela-tionships, they show more negative openness, non-verbal openness, profanity, and PEI.
These patternsare expected.
However, weaker relationships tendto show more PII and emotions.
A closer look at thedata reveals that PII topics are related to cities wherethey live, time of day, and birthday.
This showsthat the weaker relationships, usually new acquain-tances, use PII to introduce themselves or send triv-ial greetings for birthdays.
Higher emotional open-ness in weaker relationships looks strange at first,but similar to PII, emotion in weak relationships isusually expressed as greetings, reactions to baby orpet photos, or other shallow expressions.It is interesting to look at outliers, dyads with verystrong and very weak relationship groups.
Table 3summarizes the self-disclosure behaviors of theseoutliers.
There is a clear pattern that stronger re-lationships show more nonverbal openness, nega-str1 str2 weak1 weak2 weak3lmao sleep following ill lovelmfao bed thanks sure thanksshit night followers soon cuteass tired welcome better awwsmh awake follow want prettyTable 2: Topics that are most prominent in strong (?str?

In figure 1,emotional openness does not differ for the strongand weak relationship groups.
We can see why thisis when we look at the topics for the strong andweak groups.
Table 2 shows the topics that aremost prominent in the strong relationships, and theyinclude daily greetings, plans, nonverbal emotionssuch as ?lol?, ?omg?, and profanity.
In weak relation-ships, the prominent topics illustrate the prevalenceof initial getting-to-know conversations in Twitter.They welcome and greet each other about kids andpets, and offer sympathies about feeling bad.One interesting way to use our analysis is in iden-62strong weak# relation 5,640 226,116CF 14.56 1.00CL 97.74 3.00Emotion 0.21 0.22Emoticon 0.162 0.134lol 0.105 0.060xxx 0.021 0.006Pos Sent 0.31 0.33Neg Sent 0.32 0.29Neut Sent 0.27 0.29Profanity 0.0615 0.0085PII 0.016 0.019PEI 0.022 0.013Table 3: Comparing the top 1% and the bottom 1% rela-tionships as measured by the combination of CF and CL.From ?Emotion?

We find several such examples,most of which are benign, but some do show signsof risk for one of the parties.
In figure 2, we showan example of a conversation with a high degree ofself-disclosure by a dyad who shares only one con-versation in our dataset spanning two months.4 Conclusion and Future WorkWe looked at the relationship strength in Twitterconversational partners and how much they self-disclose to each other.
We found that people dis-close more to closer friends, confirming the socialpsychology studies, but people show more positivesentiment to weak relationships rather than strongrelationships.
This reflects the social norm towardfirst-time acquaintances on Twitter.
Also, emotionalopenness does not change significantly with rela-tionship strength.
We think this may be due to the in-herent difficulty in truly identifying the emotions onTwitter.
Identifying emotion merely based on key-words captures mostly shallow emotions, and deeperemotional openness either does not occur much onFigure 2: Example of Twitter conversation in a weak re-lationship that shows a high degree of self-disclosure.Twitter or cannot be captures very well.With our automatic analysis, we showed thatwhen Twitter users have conversations, they con-trol self-disclosure depending on the relationshipstrength.
We showed the results of measuring the re-lationship strength of a Twitter conversational dyadwith chain frequency and length.
We also showedthe results of automatically analyzing self-disclosurebehaviors using topic modeling.This is ongoing work, and we are looking to im-prove methods for analyzing relationship strengthand self-disclosure, especially emotions, PII andPEI.
For relationship strength, we will consider notonly interaction frequency, but also network distanceand relationship duration.
For finding emotions, firstwe will adapt existing models (Vaassen and Daele-mans, 2011; Tokuhisa et al, 2008) and suggest anew semi-supervised model.
For finding PII andPEI, we will not only consider the topics, but alsotime, place and the structure of questions and an-swers.
