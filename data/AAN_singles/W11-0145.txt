Extracting Contextual EvaluativityKevin ReschkeUniversity of California, Santa Cruzkreschke@ucsc.eduPranav AnandUniversity of California, Santa Cruzpanand@ucsc.eduAbstractRecent work on evaluativity or sentiment in the language sciences has focused on the contri-butions that lexical items provide.
In this paper, we discuss contextual evaluativity, stance that isinferred from lexical meaning and pragmatic environments.
Focusing on assessor-grounding claimslike We liked him because he so clearly disliked Margaret Thatcher, we build a corpus and construct asystem employing compositional principles of evaluativity calculation to derive that we dislikes Mar-garet Thatcher.
The resulting system has an F-score of 0.90 on our dataset, outperforming reasonablebaselines, and indicating the viability of inferencing in the evaluative domain.1 Contextual EvaluativityA central aim of contemporary research on sentiment or evaluative language is the extraction of eval-uative triples: ?evaluator, target, evaluation?.
To date, both formal (e.g., Martin and White 2005, Potts2005) and computational approaches (e.g., Pang and Lee 2008) have focused on how such triples arelexically encoded (e.g., the negative affect of scoundrel or dislike).
While lexical properties are a keysource of evaluative information, word-based considerations alone can miss pragmatic inferences result-ing from context.
(1), for example, communicates that the referent of we bears not only positive stancetowards the referent of him, but also negative stance towards Margaret Thatcher:(1) We liked him because he so clearly disliked Margaret Thatcher.LEXICAL EVALUATIVITY: ?we, him, +?
; ?he, M.T., -?CONTEXTUAL EVALUATIVITY: ?we, M.T., -?This paper argues for a compositional approach to contextual evaluativity similar to the compositionalmethods adopted for lexical evaluativity in Moilanen and Pulman (2007) and Nasukawa and Yi (2003).At the the heart of the approach is the treatment of verbal predicates (dislike in (1)) as evaluativityfunctors which relate argument/entity-level evaluativity to event-level evaluativity.As discussed in ?2, the utitlity of such a model surfaces in cases where the event-level evaluativityis known from context, and thus new information about the contextual evaluativity of the event partic-ipants (e.g.
Margaret Thatcher) can be inferred.
Consequently, the empirical focus of this paper is onstructures like (1), where the second clause provides grounds for the sentiment encoded in the first, andhence has a predictable event-level evaluation from the first clause?s evaluator.
In ?3 we describe thecollection and annotation of a corpus of such assessment-grounding configurations from large-scale webdata.
This annotated corpus serves as a test bed for experimental evaluation of various implementationsof the proposed compositional approach.
The results of these experiments (?4) strongly support a com-positional approach to contextual evaluativity inference.
A simple compositional algorithm based ona small, manually created evaluativity functor lexicon demonstrated significantly better precision thannon-compositional baselines.
Moreover, a method for automatically expanding coverage to novel predi-cates based on similarity with the manually created lexicon is shown to increase recall dramatically withmodest reduction in precision.2 A Framework For Inferring Contextual PolarityEvaluativity is concerned with determining private states (e.g., judgment or emotion) that a particularevaluator bears towards a target entity, event, or proposition.
This may be represented as a three place370Table 1: Evaluativity functors for verbs of having, withholding, disliking, and likingx y Ehave Elack Ewthhld Edprv Espr Edislike Elike+ + + - - - # - ++ - - + + # + + -- + - + + + # - +- - + - - # - + -x have/lack y a withhold/deprive/spare x of y x dislike/like yrelation, R ?

?DE , where ?
is of variable type and E is the type of evaluative stance, assumedhere to be binary.
Lexical approaches to evaluativity (see Pang and Lee 2008 for a review) have focusedon those relations that are determinable from word-internal meaning alone.
For example, describingan event e as coddling gives rise to two triples: ?AGENT(e), PATIENT(e),+?
and ?SPEAKER, e,?
?.1These lexical inferences then become part of the feature set for classifying phrasal stance (e.g., theauthor?s overall evaluativity in a sentence).
A contrasting line of research (Moilanen and Pulman 2007,Nasukawa and Yi 2003) analyzes phrasal stance as a compositional product of the polarities toward eventparticipants.
For example, the evaluative polarity of the speaker toward the event in (2a) is positivelycorrelated with the polarity toward the subject, and negatively so in (2b).

DE .
Anand and Reschke (2011) argue that evaluativity functors largely group into classes,depending on whether the predicates in question entail final states of possession and/or affectedness.
Forexample, the functors for predicates of withholding, including deprive and spare, are partial cases of thefunctor for lack (partiality reflects lexical idiosyncracies about e.g., deprivation and positive objects), asshown in Table 1.While compositional systems are designed to compute phrasal stances bottom-up, their calculi straight-forwardly allow inference to participant polarities as well, assuming knowledge of the event polarity andall but one participant.
Consider the sentence He disliked Margaret Thatcher.
By the evaluativity con-ditions in Table 1, Edislike is positive iff the evaluator has negative evaluation of Thatcher.
Thus, givenknowledge of the event polarity, we can infer the evaluator?s stance with respect to Thatcher.
In (1), thisinformation is provided by the preceding assessing clause (+, from Elike ).
As the second clause servesas grounds for the assessment in the first clause, the event described in the second clause is predictablyalso assessed as + by the evaluator we.
In our experiments we exploited this construction in particular,but the general procedure does not require it (thus, for example, evaluative adverbs such as fortunatelyand regrettably could provide an additional construction type).
This procedure is sketched for (1) below:(3) We likedelike him because he so clearly dislikededislike Margaret Thatcher.LEXICAL EVALUATIVITY: ?we, him, +?
; ?he, M.T., -?PRAGMATIC INFERENCE: ?we, edislike, +?
(edislike justifies ?we, him, +?
)COMPOSITIONAL INFERENCE: Edislike(+, y) = + iff y = +therefore, y is regarded as +, or ?we, M.T., -?Note that for this application, we may simplify the compositional picture and treat functors as eitherpreservers or reversers of the polarity of the object of interest, as is done in Moilanen and Pulman (2007)and Nasukawa and Yi (2003): preservers (such as verbs of liking) match the object polarity with theevent polarity, and reverses negate it.When the assessing clause evaluator is not affiliated with the speaker, this procedure can producemarkedly different results from lexical markers (which often show speaker evaluativity).
Thus, in (4),the speaker?s assessment of Obama?s cuts (indicated by the lexical much-needed) stands in sharp contrastwith NASA?s (determined by inference):1Here, we simplify regarding potential evaluators outside of the speaker.371(4) NASA got angry at Obama because he imposed some much-needed cuts.LEXICAL EVALUATIVITY: ?NASA, Obama, -?
; ?SPEAKER, some much needed cuts, +?CONTEXTUAL EVALUATIVITY: ?NASA, some much needed cuts, -?The assessment-grounding configuration in (1) and (4) is highly productive.
Behaviorally, implicitcausality predicates (including predicates of assessment, as well as praise and scolding) are frequentlyunderstood by experimental subjects as describing an event involving the assessment target, especiallywhen followed by because (Garvey and Carmazza, 1974; Koornneef and van Berkum, 2006).
In addition,Somasundaran and Weibe (2009) exploited a similar construction to gather reasons for people?s productassessments from online reviews.
These together suggest that such constructions could be simultaneouslyhigh-precision sources for evaluativity inference and easily obtainable from large corpora.3 Data Gathering and AnnotationWe developed a corpus of assessment-grounding excerpts from documents across the web to evaluatethe potential of the framework in ?2.
73 positive and 120 negative assessment predicates (like, adore,hate, loathe, etc.)
were selected from the MPQA subjectivity lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005).
These wereexpanded accross inflectional variants to produce 826 assessment templates, half with explicit because,half without (e.g.
terrified by X because he).
These templates were filled with personal pronouns andthe names of 26 prominent political figures and issued as websearch queries to the Yahoo!
SearchAPI.2 A total of 440,000 webdocument results were downloaded and processed using an 1152 core SunMicrosystems blade cluster.
The relevant sentences from each document were extracted, and those under80 characters in length were parsed using the Stanford Dependency Parser.3This produced 60,000 parsed assessment-grounding sentences, 6,000 of which (excluding duplicates)passed the additional criterion that the grounding clause should contain a verb with a direct object.
Thisrestriction ensured that each item in our corpus had a target for contextual polarity inference.
An addi-tional 3,300 cases were excluded because the target in the grounding clause shared possible coreferencewith the experiencer (subject) of the assessment clause.
We avoided these coreferring cases because,from the perspective of a potential application, inferences about an experiencer?s stance towards himselfare less valuable than inferences about his stance towards others.
Finally, the list was manually short-ened to include only those sentences marked as assessment-grounding configurations according to twoannotators (?
= 0.82); the classification task of whether this pragmatic connection occurs is beyond thescope of this paper.
57% of the data was removed in this pass, 14% from tokens with because and 43%from tokens without.
Implicit causality verbs not followed by because have been shown experimentallyto give rise to a much weaker preference for justification (Au, 1986), and this is confirmed in our corpussearch.
The result of this procedure was a final corpus size of 1,160.The corpus was annotated for inferred contextual polarity.
One of the authors and another annotatorcoded sentences for evaluator stance toward the object (+,-, unknown); agreement was high: ?
= 0.90.The 48 unresolved cases were adjudicated by a third annotator.
27 cases were uniformly judged un-known, involving predicates of change, disclosure (reveal, expose), and understanding (know).
Thesewere removed from the corpus, leaving 1,133 sentences for training and testing.4 System and Experimental ResultsRestricting ourselves to the assessment-grounding configuration discussed above, we treat contextualpolarity inference as a binary classification problem with two inputs: the INPUT EVENT event-levelpolarity (derived from the assessment clause) and the main verb of the grounding clause (henceforthFUNCTOR VERB).
The goal of the classifier is to correctly predict the polarity of the target NP (directobject to the functor verb) given these inputs.2http://developer.yahoo.com/search/3http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml372Table 2: Examples of verbs marked aspreserver/reverser and their sourcesEXAMPLE CLASS SOURCEreward preserver MPQA subj.

First, positively subjective verbs from the MPQA subjectivity lexiconwere marked as preservers and negatively subjective verbs were marked as reversers (1249 verbs total).For example, Edislike is a reverser.
Second, 487 verbs were culled from FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al,2005) based on their membership in six entailment classes: verbs of injury, destruction, lacking, benefit,creation, and having.
Class membership was determined by identifying 124 FrameNet frames aligningwith one or more classes, then manually selecting from these frames verbs whose class membershipwas unambiguous.
Verbs of benefit, creation, and having were marked as preservers.
Verbs of injury,destruction, and lacking were marked as reversers (Table 2).
Our system (SYS) classifies objects incontext as follows: If the functor verb is a preserver, the target NP is assigned the same polarity as theinput event polarity.
If the functor verb is a reverser, the target NP is assigned the opposite of the inputevent polarity.
This procedure is modulated by the presence of negation, as detected by a neg relation inthe dependency parse.
Under negation, a preserver acts like a reverser, and vice versa.We tested the performance of this system (SYS) on our annotated corpus against three baselines.The first baseline (B-Functor) attempts to determine the importance of the input event to the calculation.It thus ignores the preceding context, and attempts to classify the target object from the functor verbdirectly, based on the verb?s polarity in the MPQA subjectivity lexicon.
It has poor precision and recall,4reflecting both the importance of the assessment context for object polarity and the fact that the functorverbs are often not lexically sentiment bearing (e.g., predicates of possession).
The second baseline(B-Input), conversely, ignores the functor verb and uses the input event polarity as listed in the MPQAlexicon (modulo negation) for object classification.
The purpose of this baseline is to approximate aclassifier that predicts target polarity solely from the global/contextual polarity of the preceding clause.This has sharply increased precision, indicating contextual information?s importance.
The third baseline(B-MLE) picked the majority object class (+), and had the highest precision, indicating the general biasin our corpus for positive objects.
Table 3 shows the performance (precision vs. recall) of our systemcompared to the three baselines.
Its precision is significantly higher, but its F-score is limited by the lowercoverage of our manually constructed lexicon.
SYS-MPQA and SYS-Frame show the performance ofthe system when the functor lexicon is limited to the MPQA and Framenet predicates, respectively.
Bothare high precision sources of functor prediction, and pick out somewhat distinct predicates (given therecall gain of combining them).
SYS+Maj and SYS+Sim are attempts to handle the low recall of SYScaused by functor verbs in the test data which aren?t in the system?s lexicon.
SYS+Maj simply assignsthese out-of-vocabulary verbs to the majority class: preservers.
SYS+Sim classifies out-of-vocabularyverbs as preservers or reversers based on their relative similarity to the known preservers and reversersselected from FrameNet ?
an unknown verb is categorized as a preserver if its average similarity topreservers is greater than its average similarity to reversers.
Similarity was determined according to theJiang-Conrath distance measure (Jiang and Conrath, 1997), which based on links in WordNet (Fellbaum,1998).
(Note: this process cannot occur for words not found in WordNet ?
e.g.
misspellings ?
hence the4Low recall occurs when items are left unclassified due to out-of-vocabulary functor verbs.

or vice versa.373less than perfect recall).
These two systems outperform all baselines, but have indistinguishable F-scores(if misspellings are excluded, SYS+Sim has a Recall of 0.99 and F-score of 0.91).Most of the precision errors incurred by our systems were syntactic: incorrect parsing, incorrectextraction of the object, or faulty negation handling (e.g., negative quantifiers or verbs).
26% of errorsare due to word-sense disambiguation.
The verbs spoil and own each have positive and negative uses(own can mean defeat), but only one sense was registered in the lexicon, leading to errors.
The lion?sshare of these errors (22%) were due to the use of hate and similar expressions to convey jealousy (e.g.I was mad at him because he had both Boardwalk and Park Place).
In these scenarios, although theassessment is negative, the event-level polarity of the grounding clause event type is positive (because itis desired), a fact which our current system cannot handle.
One way forward would be to apply WSDtechniques to distinguish jealous from non-jealous uses of predicates of dislike.5 ConclusionWe have described a system for the extraction of what we termed contextual evaluativity ?
evaluationsof objects that arise from the understanding of pragmatic inferences.
This system, once we incorporateprocedures to automatically infer evaluativity functor class, significantly outperforms reasonable base-lines on a corpus of assessor-grounding extracts from web documents.
The system operates by runninga compositional approach to phrasal evaluativity in reverse, and is thus an instance of the potential com-putational value of such treatments of evaluativity.ReferencesAnand, P. and K. Reschke (2011).
