WIDE-RANGE RESTRUCTURING OFREPRESENTATIONS IN MACHINEINTERMEDIATETRANSLATIONTaijiro TsutsumiIBM Research, Tokyo Research LaboratoryIBM Japan, Ltd.5-19, Sanban-cho, Chiyoda-kuTokyo 102JapanThis paper describes a wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations in machine translation,which is necessary for bridging stylistic gaps between source and target languages and for generating naturaltarget sentences.We propose a practical way of designing machine translation systems, based on the transfer method, thatdeal with wide-range restructuring.
The transfer component should be divided into two separate sub-components: the wide-range restructuring sub-component and the basic transfer sub-component.
The firstsub-component deals specifically with global reorganization of intermediate representations in order tobridge the stylistic gaps between source and target languages, and the second performs local and straightfor-ward processing, including lexicai transfer and basic structural transfer.This approach provides us with an effective basis for improving translation quality by systematicallyenhancing the transfer rules without sacrificing the clarity and maintainability of the transfer component.
Italso guarantees that most of the translation process can be based on the augmented Context Free Grammar(CFG) formalism and the so-called compositionality principle, by which we can both systematically expandand maintain linguistic data and design the simplified process control necessary for an efficient machinetranslation system.1 INTRODUCTIONMuch effort has been devoted to research into, and develop-ment of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum1985).
However, the quality of the output sentences pro-duced by most machine translation systems is not highenough to have any marked effect on translation productiv-ity.A machine translation system produces a variety ofexpressions in the target language, including good, fair, andpoor expressions.
In this paper, we define these distinctionsas follows.
"Good" sentences can be easily understood andhave high readability because of their naturalness, "fair"sentences can be understood but their readability is low,and "poor" sentences cannot be understood without refer-ring to the source sentences.To improve the quality of translation, the followingmajor functions hould be implemented:1. selection of equivalents for words;2. reordering of words; and3.
improvement ofsentence styles.A machine translation system that does not have Func-tion 3 often produces "good" output in the case of transla-tion between languages in the same linguistic group ifFunctions 1 and 2 are appropriately achieved.
However,most output will be "fair" or "poor" in the case of transla-tion between languages in different linguistic groups, be-cause of the stylistic gaps between them.
We need toenhance Function 3 as well as Functions 1 and 2 in order tochange "fair" or "poor" sentences to "good" or "fair" ones.Note that in this paper, style means a preferable grammat-ical form that successfully conveys a correct meaning.First, let us consider how to select target languageequivalents for words in the source language.
An appropri-ate part of speech for a word is first determined by thegrammatical constraints provided by the analysis gram-mar.
Nouns and the verb in a simple sentence can then beappropriately translated according to the combinative con-straints between the case frame of the verb and the seman-tic markers of the nouns.
This is a well-known mechanismfor practical semantic processing in machine translation.However, this way of selecting equivalents has the limita-tion that we cannot classify verbs and nouns in sufficientdetail, because of ambiguities in the definitions and usageof words.
Many researchers in machine translation claimthat a much more powerful semantic processing mecha-Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 71Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations inMachine Translationnism with a knowledge base is required for this purpose.This is a long-range research project in the field.Second, there seem to be few critical problems in reorder-ing words if structural transfer is appropriately carried out.In a simple sentence, for example, we can usually reorderwords correctly on the basis of the case frame of the verb.Thus, the improvement of sentence styles is one of thecrucial functions required for further enhancement of thepresent translation quality.
Even when the output is "fair"in quality, it has to be read carefully, because the readabil-ity is often low.
We expect an improvement in sentencestyles to result in an improvement in translation qualityfrom "poor" or "fair" to "good."
Improving sentence stylesseems to be easier than selecting better equivalents forwords, because there are syntactic lues to help us make thestyles more natural.This paper focuses on an approach to the improvement ofsentence styles by wide-range restructuring of intermediaterepresentations.
Wide-range restructuring in this papermeans the global restructuring of intermediate r presenta-tions, usually including the replacement of some classwords (i.e., noun, adjective, verb, and adverb).
Some pa-pers have mentioned limited restructuring of intermediaterepresentations (Bennett and Slocum 1985; Vauquois andBoitet 1985; Isabelle and Bourbeau 1985; Nagao et al1985; McCord 1985; Nomura et al 1986).
For example,LMT (McCord 1985) has a restructuring function afterthe transfer phase, to form a bridge between the basic stylesof English and German.
The Mu system (Nagao et al1985) has two specific restructuring functions, before andafter the transfer phase, mainly to handle exceptionalcases.However, few machine translation systems have so farhad a comprehensive component for wide-range restructur-ing (Slocum 1985), mainly because many systems arepresently designed to produce output hat is at best "fair,"and little effort has been devoted to obtaining "good"output or natural sentences.
As a matter of fact, wide-range restructuring functions are usually scattered over theanalysis, transfer, and generation phases in an ad hoc way.Because of complicated implementations, the systems cometo have low maintainability and efficiency.Few papers so far have systematically discussed thecrucial stylistic gaps between languages, the importance ofwide-range restructuring of intermediate representationsto bridge these gaps, and effective mechanisms for restruc-turing.
A restructuring mechanism is necessary even whena machine translation system is based on the semantic-leveltransfer or pivot method (Carbonell et al 1981).In this paper, we first discuss stylistic gaps betweenlanguages, and the importance of dealing with them effec-tively in order to generate natural target sentences.
Wethen propose a restructuring mechanism that successfullybridges the stylistic gaps and preserves a high maintainabil-ity for the transfer phase of a machine translation system.Last, we discuss the implementation of the wide-rangerestructuring function.2 STYLISTIC GAPS BETWEEN LANGUAGESIn discussions on the stylistic gaps between English andJapanese, it is often said that English is a HAVE-type orDO-type language, whereas Japanese is a BE-type or BE-COME-type language.
This contrast corresponds to thedifferences in the ways people recognize things and expresstheir ideas about them (Nitta 1986), and hence is consid-ered as a difference of viewpoint.
Idioms and metaphors areheavily dependent upon each society and culture, and wesometimes have to reinterpret them to give an appropriatetranslation.
Each language also has its own specific func-tion word constructions, which are used to express pecificmeanings.
These specific constructions cannot be directlytranslated into other languages.We categorize the major stylistic gaps as follows: (1)stylistic gaps in viewpoint, (2) stylistic gaps in idioms andmetaphors, (3) stylistic gaps in specific onstructions u ingfunction words, and (4) others.
We will discuss these gapsin more detail in the case of English-to-Japanese transla-tion by referring to examples extracted from the literature(Bekku 1979; Anzai 1983) and slightly modified for ourpurpose.
In each example, the first sentence is the originalEnglish and the second one is an equivalent or a roughequivalent in Japanese-like English, which will help usrecognize the stylistic gaps, though some of the rewrittenEnglish is not strictly acceptable.2.1 STYLISTIC GAPS IN VIEWPOINTThe following are some examples of stylistic gaps due todifferences of viewpoint.1.
Inanimate noun + transitive verbi) Inanimate noun + have(I-a) The room has two tables.
(l-b) Two tables are in the room.ii) Others(2-a) This chapter contains the explanation.
(2-b) The explanation is contained in this chapter.The meaning of (l-a) is that the room contains twotables.
However, an inanimate subject for the verb have isnot allowed in Japanese.
Japanese usually expresses thesame fact as in (l-b), without using an inanimate subject.
(2-a) and (2-b) show a case in which the voice is changed toavoid an inanimate subject in a Japanese sentence.2.
Gerund (intransitive verb) + of + noun + transitiveverb(3-a) The humming of insects reminded me of autumn.
(3-b) Because insects were humming, it seemed to me itwas autumn.T~:is case is similar to example (I-a) in that the subject of(3-a) is inanimate.
An event or action, which may be thesubject of an English sentence, isusually treated as a causeor reason in a Japanese sentence.
"/2 ,Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations in Machine Translation3.
Inanimate noun + allow + noun + to-infinitive(4-a) The support allows you to write IPL procedures.
(4-b) You can write IPL procedures by using the support.In this case, we can consider the subject as a tool ormethod, as explicitly rewritten in (4-b).4.
Have + adjective + noun (two-place predicate)(5-a) The routine has a relatively low usage rate.
(5-b) The usage rate of the routine is relatively low.The adjective low in the noun phrase low usage rate in(5-a) is removed and used as predicative form in (5-b).Japanese often prefers predicative expressions like this.5.
Adjective + verbal noun + of  + noun(6-a) He is a good speaker of  English.
(6-b) He speaks English well.The noun phrase a good speaker is rewritten to form apredicative phrase.6.
Special verb (do, make, perform, etc.)
+ adjective +verbal noun + of + noun(7-a) The DOS/VSE SCP is designed to make efficientuse of  a hardware system.
(7-b) The DOS/VSE SCP is designed to use a hardwaresystem efficiently.This is also a case in which Japanese prefers a predica-tive phrase.7.
Special determiner (no, few, little, etc.)
+ noun(8-a) I have no French books.
(8-b) I do not have any French books.This is a case in which a special determiner should beremoved from the noun phrase and rewritten as an adverb.If  we translate these English sentences literally intoJapanese, we will have low readability for the Japanesesentences.2.2 STYLISTIC GAPS IN IDIOMS AND METAPHORSIdioms and metaphors should be distinguished from otherphrases in a text, because they have implicit and fixedmeanings.
The following are some examples:(9-a) A car drinks gasoline.
(9-b) A car requires a lot of gasoline.
(10-a) Cigarettes are time bombs.
(10-b) Cigarettes gradually harm us.
(1 l-a) He burned his bridges.
(1 I-b) He destroyed his alternative options.In case (9-a), we will face difficulty in semantic process-ing if we try to translate the sentence directly.
The reason isthat the verb drink usually requires an animate subjectwhereas the noun car is, in most cases, classified as aninanimate thing.We can translate xample (10-a) literally if we want topreserve the humor conveyed by the original sentence.However, this is not often possible because of culturaldifferences.
Example (1 l-a) is a typical case of somethingthat we cannot ranslate literally into Japanese.2.3 STYLISTIC GAPS IN SPECIAL FUNCTION WORDCONSTRUCTIONSThe following are some examples of stylistic gaps due tospecial English constructions using function words.
(12-a) It is required that you specify the assignment.
(12-b) That you specify the assignment is required.
(13-a) The system operation is so impaired that the IPLprocedure has to be repeated.
(13-bl) Because the system operation is impaired verymuch, the IPL procedure has to be repeated.
(13-b2) The system operation is impaired to the extentthat the IPL procedure has to be repeated.
(14-a) The box is too heavy for a child to carry.
(14-bl) Because the box is very heavy, a child cannotcarry it.
(14-b2) The box is very heavy to the extent that a childcannot carry it.There is no direct way to translate the examples givenabove, because the grammatical functions conveyed by thespecial constructions using function words are often ex-pressed in a very different way in a target language.2.4 OTHERSIn addition to the stylistic gaps described above, we oftensee other stylistic gaps based on the meaning of a word.
Forexample, the verb bridge in English should be translated by"hashi (a noun meaning a bridge) wo (a case particlemeaning an object) kakeru (a verb meaning 'install')" inJapanese.
One English verb corresponds to a noun, a caseparticle, and a verb in this case.
A set of consecutive wordsmay have a fixed meaning: for example, a number of can beconsidered as many in most cases.
Differences in tense,aspect, and modality are also related to stylist gaps betweenlanguages, although we do not discuss these in detail here.So far, we have discussed four types of stylistic gaps.Generally, there are larger stylistic gaps between lan-guages belonging to different groups than between lan-guages in the same group.
It is clear that if we can dealadequately with these stylistic gaps, we can further im-prove translation quality.3 How TO DEAL WITH STYLISTIC GAPSThis section discusses a framework for dealing with thestylistic gaps we noted in the previous ection.3.1 THE COMPOSlTIONALITY PRINCIPLE INMACHINE TRANSLATIONMost machine translation systems (Slocum 1985) aimingat practical use employ the transfer method, which dividesComputational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 73Taij iro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations in Machine Translationthe whole process into three phases: analysis of the sourcelanguage, transfer between intermediate r presentations,and generation of the target language.
The basic conceptunderlying current machine translation technology is thecompositionality principle (Nagao 1986).
The originalidea of the principle is that the meaning of a sentence canbe assembled from the meaning of each of its constituentsand, moreover, that the assembling process can be imple-mented by assembling the forms or syntax that convey themeanings.
Montague grammar is one of the theoreticalbases of the principle, and some work applying Montaguegrammar to machine translation has been reported (Lands-bergen 1982; Nishida and Doshita 1983).
If the composi-tionality principle is applied to machine translation, weexpect hat it will be possible to translate a whole sentenceby translating each word individually and then appropri-ately composing all the translated words.For example, let us consider the following two sentences,which have the same meaning.S: I drink water.
(English)JS: watashi ha mizu wo nomu.
(Japanese)(I) (water) (drink)Let us assume that the above sentences have the syntac-tic structures shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), based on thegrammars shown in (c) and (d), respectively.
Note that theparentheses in the right-hand side of the last rule in (d)denote a condition that must be met in applying the rule.These structures are also considered to be the intermediatestructures (i.e.
the source structure and target structure) inthe transfer phase of machine translation.The ideal machine translation based on the composition-ality principle ensures that structure (a) is successfullytransferred to structure (b) by applying the transfer ules,as shown in Figure 2.In Figure 2, the transfer ules are symbolized for conve-nience.
The left-hand sides of the rules consist of matchingpatterns that correspond to the grammar of the EnglishS JS\[ .

The Transfer Rules.sentence, and the right-hand sides consist of target patternsthat correspond to the grammar of the target Japanesesentence.The steps of the transfer process using these transferrules are shown in Figure 3.
This transfer process is doneentirely in a bottom-up and left-to-right manner by usingthe transfer ules, and is based on the compositionalityprinciple.
The process is simple, easy to control, and easy toimplement efficiently.Let us consider the stylistic gaps mentioned in the previ-ous section.
To bridge such gaps, we need to replace somewords with new words and perform restructuring widely.
Itis important to recognize that the words involved in therephtcement are class words (i.e.
noun, adjective, verb, andadverb) rather than function words (i.e.
preposition, auxil-iary verb, conjunction, relative pronoun, particle, etc.
), asshown in the examples of types 2.1 and 2.2.
For example, incases (6-a) and (6-b), good is replaced by well and speakeris replaced by speaks.
In cases (10-a) and (10-b), are timebombs is replaced by gradually harm us.
On the otherhand, most words involved in the replacement are functionwords in the examples of type 2.3.
For example, in cases(13-a) and (13-bl), so and that are replaced by becauseand very much.The above-mentioned framework based on the composi-tionality principle cannot provide appropriate treatmentfor stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and 2.2, because wide-rangestructure handling, as well as the replacement of some classwords, is necessary instead of the local and bottom-upstructure handling that includes ome treatment of func-tion words.

It is not difficult o handlegaps of type 2.4 except for those caused by tense, aspect,and modality, because they can be bridged only by localtreatment of constituents instead of wide-range restructur-ing.
For example, if a system finds the consecutive words anumber of in a sentence, the system can exceptionally treatit as one word meaning many in the previous framework.
Itis normally translated by replacing it with a target-language quivalent.3.2 TWO-STEP TRANSFER METHODTo deal with stylistic gaps effectively in a system based onthe transfer method, we propose the incorporation of aspecific sub-component for wide-range restructuring of theintermediate structures inthe transfer component, as shownin Figure 4.
This gives an example of a system configura-tion for English-to-Japanese machine translation.
The ba-sic transfer consists of lexical transfer and reordering ofwords.The wide-range restructuring should be done after anal-ysis of the input sentence and before the basic transfer.
Wetake advantage of syntactic lues given in the intermediaterepresentation for effective restructuring after analysis ofthe input.
The wide-range restructuring, which changes theglobal structure as well as some class words of the sentence,should be performed not after but before the basic transfer,for the following reasons.1.
The restructuring makes the basic transfer easier and italso reduces the transfer ules, because it often contrib-utes to standardization r limitation of English sentencestyles, as discussed in more detail in Section 3.32.
The restructuring is not affected by transfer errors,which often occur because of the complexity of thetransfer process.By means of this restructuring sub-component, the inter-mediate representation f the input sentence istransformedor reinterpreted from a source-dependent xpression i to atarget-dependent o e. We can define augmented CFGs foranalysis and generation i this framework.

A Machine Translation SystemIncorporating a Wide-Range RestructuringSub-Component.rule appropriately and control for the wide-range restruc-turing sub-component, the output structures of both thesub-component and the basic transfer sub-component canbe defined by using augmented CFGs that deal with condi-tions for rule applications.
In other words, the basic trans-fer sub-component can specialize in transfer from oneaugmented CFG system to another, as illustrated in Figure2.Because wide-range restructuring, which does not suitthe compositionality principle, can be performed entirely inthe restructuring sub-component, and because the basictransfer can be simplified and specialized in local andbottom-up treatments of structures based on the aug-mented CFG formalism, as mentioned above, all the pro-cesses of machine translation except wide-range restructur-ing can be based on the augmented CFG formalism or thecompositionality principle.
This approach makes the wholesystem simple, easy to control, and efficient.If a machine translation system uses analysis-tree struc-tures as intermediate structures (Lehmann et al 1981;Nitta et al 1982), wide-range restructuring can be intro-duced appropriately at the surface level.
If the systemperforms deep analysis of the input sentence and creates asemantic representation such as a frame-like structure or asemantic network as an intermediate r presentation, wide-range restructuring may be required at the deep level.
Thisis true whenever we handle stylistic gaps of types 2.1 and2.2.
However, gaps of type 2.3 can be handled by analysis,and no wide-range restructuring is required from the sys-tem that performs deep analysis of the input sentence.3.3 ADVANTAGE OF THE TWO-STEP TRANSFERMETHOD OVER THE SINGLE-STEP TRANSFER METHODLet us discuss the advantage of this approach over theconventional single-step transfer method from the stand-point of maintainability.Technical documents contain many variants of sentencepatterns.
The examples in Section 2 are regarded as vari-ants from the viewpoint of English-to-Japanese translation.As a matter of fact, several different English sentences inan English technical document can often be translated bythe same Japanese sentence.
In other words, a wide varietyof expression i  English can be reduced to some extent inJapanese, because the most important concern in technicaldocuments i that each sentence should convey technicalinformation correctly.
Therefore, we may standardize orcontrol styles of English sentences for the sake of English-to-Japanese translation.The two-step transfer method including wide-range re-structuring is an appropriate way to take advantage of thisphenomenon.
If we encounter a new variant of a sentencepattern in English, we only have to write an Englishrestructuring rule in the case of the two-step transfermethod.
On the other hand, a whole transfer ule, which isusually harder to write, is needed in the single-transfermethod.
If we want to modify a target Japanese sentencethat corresponds tosome English sentences, we only have toComputational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 75Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations i  Machine Translationmodify the corresponding basic transfer ule, instead ofmodifying all the transfer rules for these English sentences.Consequently, it is easier to maintain the transfer rules ifthe system is based on the two-step transfer method, espe-cially in translating technical documents.4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WIDE-RANGERESTRUCTURING FUNCTIONA prototype English-to-Japanese machine translation sys-tem, SHALT (Tsutsumi 1986), is based on the two-steptransfer method described in Section 3.2.
So far we havedeveloped about 500 wide-range restructuring rules to copewith the stylistic gaps exemplified inSection 2, and we haveconfirmed the effectiveness of the restructuring throughtest translation of a few IBM computer manuals.In this section, we discuss the details of the rules for thewide-range restructuring and their applications inSHALT,as an example.
SHALT is implemented in LISP, and theEnglish and Japanese intermediate r presentations are syn-tactic-analysis tree structures.4.1 WIDE-RANGE RESTRUCTURING RULESAND THEIR APPLICATIONSA wide-range restructuring rule consists of a pair of amatching pattern and a target pattern.
If an input Englishtree structure matches a matching pattern, then a targetJapanese-like English tree structure isgenerated accordingto specifications in a target pattern.
A matching pattern isdefined as follows.
Note that * allows repetition of specifica-tions.\ [ (STRUCTURE - (MATCHING -ELEMENT"  ))" \]whereSTRUCTURE:  MATCHING-VARIABLE  or 0MATCHING-ELEMENT:  MATCHING-VARIABLE or(MATCHING-VARIABLE MATCHING-CONDIT ION*)MATCHING-CONDIT ION:  (L ISP -FUNCTION-NAMEARGUMENT' )STRUCTURE specifies the tree structure to be checked.If 0 is specified, the whole input structure is treated.
IfMATCHING-VARIABLE is specified, its value (i.e.
partof a structure), which has already been set by MATCH-ING-ELEMENTs in an earlier matching process, is atarget for checking.
A sequence of MATCHING-ELE-MENTs checks a sequence of daughter tree structures.
Ifspecified MATCHING-CONDITIONs match a structure,a specified MATCHING-VARIABLE is set to the struc-ture.
If a MATCHING-ELEMENT is a mere MATCH-ING-VARIABLE, any structure or nil can be set for thevariable.
MATCHING-CONDITION specifies a LISPfunction and its arguments.
LISP functions check parts ofspeech, terminal symbols, or other information of a struc-ture.
All specifications in a matching pattern form ANDconditions, except arguments of LISP functions, whichform OR conditions.A target pattern specifies the required output structureby using MATCHING-VARIABLEs where structures arealready set and by adding new structures.Figure 5 shows an example of a wide-range restructuringrule and its application.
Figure 5 (a) shows the output ofEnglish analysis, which is the input for wide-range restruc-turing.
Figure 5 (b) shows a wide-range restructuring ruleand (c) gives the output of the restructuring.The left-hand side of the restructuring rule is a matchingpattern, and the right-hand side of the rule is a targetpattern in Figure 5 (b).
Numbers preceded by *, such as * 1,?
2, and *3, denote MATCHING-VARIABLEs.
There arefour specifications of (STRUCTURE-  (MATCHING-ELEMENT*))  in the matching pattern, such as (0- (*1( '2  (T" i t " ) )  *3 .
.
.
*7))  and ( '6 -  (*8 (*9(P AD, J)) .
.
.
*11)).
A MATCHING-CONDIT ION(T "it'") in the matching pattern denotes that the terminalsymbol of the tree should be "it."
(P ADJ) denotes that thepart of speech of the root node should be ADJ (i.e.,adjective).
T and P are the LISP function ames to performthese specific hecks.The target pattern in Figure 5 (b) specifies that thevalue.s of MATCHING-VARIABLEs * 1, * 14, * 19, *3, *5,F .......NPI VERB1IPRONit isS.

"B J-important" in Figure 5 (c) meansthat "important" inthis case should be treated as a predica-tive adjective.These specifications for the wide-range restructuringrules were found to be user-friendly in our experience ofdeveloping a practically sized rule set.The wide-range restructuring rules are categorized intoabout 20 groups according to their functions.
This categori-zation is more detailed than the one described in Section 2.These groups and rules in each group are arranged sequen-tially so that more specific and local rules can come earlierwhen they are checked.
Checking and application of theserules are done along an input tree in top-down and left-to-right manner.
If one of the rules in a group has successfullybeen applied to an input tree, then the rest of the rules inthe same group are no longer checked, and the process goesto the next rule group.
After all the groups have beenchecked and applied to the input tree, the process goes tothe next daughter tree of the input tree.
When the processgoes to a new tree, the system checks the category name ofits root node and thus avoids useless checking of the tree.Because all the rules are used in a fixed sequence, they canbe easily maintained.Figure 6 shows the output of the basic transfer thatfollows the process of the wide-range restructuring.
As wecompare the output of the wide-range restructuring, whichis the input of the basic transfer, in Figure 5 (c) with thetree structure in Figure 6, we can see how the basic transferis done.
For example, sub-trees COMPL, NP3, VERB2,NP2, VP, and VERB3 in Figure 5 (c) are transferred tosub-trees JANOUN, JNPPART3, JVP2, JNPPART2,JNC, and JVP3 in Figure 6, respectively.
This exampleshows that the basic transfer is more straightforward andlocalized than the wide-range restructuring.J Sr .

Output of the Basic Transfer.4.2 FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON IMPLEMENTATIONLet us discuss example (5-a) in Section 2.
The wide-rangerestructuring rule is as follows.
If the main verb is have andthe head noun (rate) of the object is a two-place predicateand there is an adjective (low) that modifies the head noun,then restructure it as shown in (5-b).
If the head noun ofthe object is classified as "ATTRIBUTE," the restructur-ing is obligatory.
Otherwise, translation without his restruc-turing is not very good, but acceptable.The restructuring rule for case (l-a) in Section 2 isslightly complicated because we need richer information,such as (room contains table), so as to restructure (l-a)into the form 'NP1 be in NP2.'
If the input is The table hasfour legs, it will be restructured differently into the formFour legs exist for the table because of the above con-straint.
This is not standard English, but it is very similar inform to Japanese.We have not yet implemented a way of using semanticinformation, such as (room contains table), as constraint,because the desired restructuring can be done on the basisof syntactic restrictions in the field of IBM computermanuals.
However, the approach proposed in this paper canbe augmented tohandle semantic information without anycrucial problems, if we prepare a knowledge base.5 CONCLUSIONSIn this paper, we discuss the importance of treating stylisticgaps between languages and methods of doing so.
A compre-hensive wide-range restructuring that can cope with stylis-tic gaps is indispensable for improving the quality of trans-lation, especially between languages from different linguisticgroups, such as English and Japanese.We propose a practical way of designing machine trans-lation systems.
The transfer component should be dividedinto two separate sub-components: he wide-range restruc-turing sub-component and the basic transfer sub-compo-nent.
Because the first of these deals with global reorganiza-tion of the intermediate r presentations, u ually includingthe replacement of some class words, the second only has todo local, straightforward processing.
This approach makesthe transfer component much clearer and more maintain-able than the conventional single-step transfer method.
Italso guarantees that, except for the wide-range restructur-ing sub-component, all of the translation process can bebased on the augmented CFG formalism and the composi-tionality principle.
The ease of controlling the processmakes the system efficient, which is crucial for the develop-ment of a practical machine translation system.As a future direction, it will be necessary for us to pursuea thorough contrastive study of several languages, in termsof semantics as well as syntax.
This will enable us to buildmore effective rules for restructuring that will furtherimprove the quality of machine translation.Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 77Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations i  Machine Translation6 ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI am grateful to D.
