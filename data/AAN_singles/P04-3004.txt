TotalRecall is a bilingualconcordancer that support search query inEnglish or Chinese for relevant sentences andtranslations.
Although initially intended forlearners of English as Foreign Language (EFL)in Taiwan, it is a gold mine of texts in Englishor Mandarin Chinese.
TotalRecall isparticularly useful for those who write in ortranslate into a foreign language.
We exploitedand structured existing high-qualitytranslations from bilingual corpora from aTaiwan-based Sinorama Magazine andOfficial Records of Hong Kong LegislativeCouncil to build a bilingual concordance.Novel approaches were taken to provide high-precision bilingual alignment on thesubsentential and lexical levels.
A browser-based user interface was developed for ease ofaccess over the Internet.
Users can search forword, phrase or expression in English orMandarin.
The Web-based user interfacefacilitates the recording of the user actions toprovide data for further research.1 IntroductionTranslation memory has been found to be moreeffective alternative to machine translation fortranslators, especially when working with batchesof similar texts.
That is particularly true with so-called delta translation of the next versions forpublications that need continuous revision such asan encyclopaedia or user?s manual.
On anotherarea of language study, researchers on EnglishLanguage Teaching (ELT) have increasinglylooked to concordancer of very large corpora as anew re-source for translation and language learning.Concordancers have been indispensable forlexicographers.
But now language teachers andstudents also embrace the concordancer to fosterdata-driven, student-centered learning.A bilingual concordance, in a way, meets theneeds of both communities, the computer assistedtranslation (CAT) and computer assisted languagelearning (CALL).
A bilingual concordancer is likea monolingual concordance, except that eachsentence is followed by its translation counterpartin a second language.
?Existing translationscontain more solutions to more translationproblems than any other existing resource.?
(Isabelle 1993).
The same can be argued forlanguage learning; existing texts offer moreanswers for the learner than any teacher orreference work do.However, it is important to provide easy accessfor translators and learning writers alike to find therelevant and informative citations quickly.
For in-stance, the English-French concordance system,TransSearch provides a familiar interface for theusers (Macklovitch et al 2000).
The user type inthe expression in question, a list of citations willcome up and it is easy to scroll down until onefinds translation that is useful much like using asearch engine.
TransSearch exploits sentencealignment techniques (Brown et al1990; Gale andChurch 1990) to facilitate bilingual search at thegranularity level of sentences.In this paper, we describe a bilingualconcordancer which facilitate search andvisualization with fine granularity.
TotalRecallexploits subsentential and word alignment toprovide a new kind of bilingual concordancer.Through the interactive interface and clustering ofshort subsentential bi-lingual citations, it helpstranslators and non-native speakers find ways totranslate or express them-selves in a foreignlanguage.2 Aligning the corpusCentral to TotalRecall is a bilingual corpus and aset of programs that provide the bilingual analysesto yield a translation memory database out of thebilingual corpus.
Currently, we are working withA: Database selection B: English query C: Chinese query D: Number of items per pageE: Normal view F: Clustered summary according to translation G: Order by counts or lengthsH: Submit bottom I: Help file J: Page index K: English citation L: Chinese citation M: Date and titleN: All citations in the cluster O: Full text context P: Side-by-side sentence alignmentFigure 2.
The results of searching for ?hard?bilingual corpora from a Taiwan-based SinoramaMagazine and Official Records of Hong KongLegislative Council.
A large bilingual collection ofStudio Classroom English lessons will be providedin the near future.
That would allow us to offerbilingual texts in both translation directions andwith different levels of difficulty.
Currently, thearticles from Sinorama seems to be quite usefullyby its own, covering a wide range of topics,reflecting the personalities, places, and events inTaiwan for the past three decades.The concordance database is composed of bi-lingual sentence pairs, which are mutual translation.In addition, there are also tables to recordadditional information, including the source ofeach sentence pairs, metadata, and the informationon phrase and word level alignment.
With thatadditional information, TotalRecall providesvarious functions, including 1. viewing of the fulltext of the source with a simple click.
2.highlighted translation counterpart of the queryword or phrase.
3. ranking that is pedagogicallyuseful for translation and language learning.We are currently running an operational systemwith Sinorama Magazine articles and HK LEGCOrecords.
These bilingual texts that go intoTotalRecall must be rearranged and structured.
Wedescribe the main steps below:2.1 Subsentential alignmentWhile the length-based approach (Church andGale 1991) to sentence alignment produces verygood results for close language pairs such asFrench and English at success rates well over 96%,it does not fair as well for disparate language pairssuch as English and Mandarin Chinese.
Alsosentence alignment tends to produce pairs of a longChinese sentence and several English sentences.Such pairs of mutual translation make it difficultfor the user to read and grasp the answersembedded in the retrieved citations.We develop a new approach to aligning Englishand Mandarin texts at sub-sentential level inparallel corpora based on length and punctuationmarks.The subsentential alignment starts with parsingeach article from corpora and putting them into thedatabase.
Subsequently articles are segmented intosubsentential segments.
Finally, segments in thetwo languages which are mutual translation arealigned.Sentences and subsentenial phrases and clausesare broken up by various types of punctuation inthe two languages.
For fragments much shorterthan sentences, the variances of length ratio arelarger leading to unacceptably low precision ratefor alignment.
We combine length-based andpunctuation-based approach to cope with thedifficulties in subsentential alignment.Punctuations in one language translate more or lessconsistently into punctuations in the other language.Therefore the information is useful incompensating for the weakness of length-basedapproach.
In addition, we seek to further improvethe accuracy rates by employing cognates andlexical information.
We experimented with animplementation of the pro-posed method on a verylarge Mandarin-English parallel corpus of recordsof Hong Kong Legislative Council withsatisfactory results.
Experiment results show thatthe punctuation-based approach outperforms thelength-based approach with precision ratesapproaching 98%.Figure 1  The result of subsentential alignmentand collocation alignment.2.2 Word and Collocation AlignmentAfter sentences and their translation counterpartsare identified, we proceeded to carry out finer-grained alignment on the word level.
We employedthe Competitive Linking Algorithm (Melamed2000) produce high precision word alignment.
Wealso extract English collocations and their transla-tion equivalent based on the result of word align-ment.
These alignment results were subsequentlyused to cluster citations and highlight translationequivalents of the query.3 Aligning the corpusTotalRecall allows a user to look for instances ofspecific words or expressions and its translationcounterpart.
For this purpose, the system opens uptwo text boxes for the user to enter queries in anyor both of the two languages involved.
We offersome special expressions for users to specify thefollowing queries:?
Single or multi-word query ?
spaces be-tween words in a query are considered as ?and.
?For disjunctive query, use ?||?
to de-note ?or.??
Every word in the query will be expandedto all surface forms for search.
That includessingular and plural forms, and various tense of theverbs.?
TotalRecall automatically ignore high fre-quency words in a stoplist such as ?the,?
?to,?
and?of.??
It is also possible to ask for exact match bysubmitting query in quotes.
Any word within thequotes will not be ignored.
It is useful forsearching named entities.Once a query is submitted, TotalRecall displaysthe results on Web pages.
Each result appears as apair of segments in English and Chinese, in side-by-side format.
A ?context?
hypertext link is in-cluded for each citation.
If this link is selected, anew page appears displaying the original documentof the pair.
If the user so wishes, she can scrollthrough the following or preceding pages of con-text in the original document.
TotalRecall presentthe results in a way that makes it easy for the userto grasp the information returned to her:?
When operating in the monolingual mode,TotalRecall presents the citation according tolengths.?
When operating in the bilingual mode, To-talRecall clusters the citations according to thetranslation counterparts and presents the user witha summary page of one example each for differenttranslations.
The query words and translationcounterparts are high-lighted.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we describe a bilingualconcordance designed as a computer assistedtranslation and language learning tool.
Currently,TotalRecll uses Sinorama Magazine andHKLEGCO corpora as the databases of translationmemory.
We have already put a beta version online and experimented with a focus group ofsecond language learners.
Novel features ofTotalRecall include highlighting of query andcorresponding translations, clustering and rankingof search results according translation andfrequency.TotalRecall enable the non-native speaker who islooking for a way to express an idea in English orMandarin.
We are also adding on the basic func-tions to include a log of user activities, which willrecord the users?
query behavior and their back-ground.
We could then analyze the data and finduseful information for future research.Subsentential alignment resultsFrom 1983 to 1991, the average rate of wage growth for all tradesand industries was only 1.6%.????????????????????
