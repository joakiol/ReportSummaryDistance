SRA:DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLOMON SYSTEM AS USED FOR.MUC- 5Chinatsu Aone, Sharon Flank, Doug McKee, Paul Kraus eSystems Research and Applications (SRA )2000 15th Street Nort hArlington, VA 2220 1aonecQ sra .coinBACKGROUN DSRA used a language-independent, domain-independent, multipurpose text understanding system as the coreof the MUC-5 system for extraction from English and Japanese joint venture texts .
SRA's NLP core system ,SOLOMON, has been under development since 1986 .
It has been used for a variety of domains, and wa saimed from the start to be language-independent, domain-independent, and application-independent .
Morerecently, SOLOMON has been extended to be multilingual, beginning with Spanish in 1990 and Japanese i n1991 .
The Spanish-Japanese text understanding system that uses SOLOMON was developed for a dornai nvery different from the MUC-5 joint venture domain (cf .
Aone, et al.
[2]) .SOLOMON's principal applications have been in data extraction, but it is also used in a prototyp emachine translation system (cf.
Aone and McKee [5]) .
The domain areas in which SOLOMON application shave been developed are : financial, terrorism, medical, and the MUC-5 joint-venture domain .
SRA hassignificantly enhanced its capability to add new domains and languages by developing new strategies fo rdata acquisition using both statistical techniques and a variety of user-friendly tools .MUC-5 SYSTEM ARCHITECTUR ESOLOMON employs a modular, data-driven architecture to achieve its language- and domain-independence .The MUC-5 system, which uses SOLOMON as a core engine, consists of seven processing modules an dcorresponding data modules, as shown in Figure 1, which will be described in the following sections .Message ZonerThe Message Zoner uploads the SGML-annotated text file into the data extraction system .
Input files areassumed to have been proprocessed so that they contain only "rigorous markup" (cf.
Goldfarb [8]) SGM Ltags and text ; however, we do not require sentences or paragraphs to be tagged.
Japanese text is assume dto be encoded in EUC, but tags must be ASCII .All input, including tags, is tokenized using a simple, language-independent, regular expression recognizer .The (multi-word) tokens are parsed into sentences, paragraphs, headers and documents using a simpl eoperator-precendence grammar (cf.
Aho, Sethi and Ullman [1]) operating on punctuation and tags .
Thetokenizer and parser are written entirely in lex .207Figure 1 : MUC-5 System ArchitectureSentence and paragraph boundries are inferred using a conservative algorithm and marked as inferred .Inference is not performed if sentences and paragraphs are rigorously marked .
The output is piped to apost-processor, which does a fast lookup of each word in a btree gazetteer, and includes entry informationin the tokens of place names .PreprocessingPreprocessing consists of two processors, the morphological analyzer and the pattern matcher, and associate ddata in the form of morphological data, lexicons, and patterns for each language.
Its input is a tokenizedmessage, and its output is a series of lexical entries with syntactic and semantic attributes .Declarative morphological data for inflection-rich Japanese and Spanish is compiled into finite-stat emachines .
The English domain lexicon was derived from development texts automatically, using a statistica ltechnique (cf.
McKee and Maloney [10]) .
This derived lexicon also contains automatically acquired domain -specific subcategorization frames and predicate-argument mapping rules called situation types (cf.
Aone an dMcKee [3]), as shown in Figure 2 .Pattern recognition handles a wide range of phenomena, including multi-words, numbers, acronyms ,money, date, person names, locations, and organizations .
We extended the Pattern matcher to handle multi-level pattern recognition .
The pattern data are divided into ordered multiple groups called priority groups,and the patterns in each group are fired sequentially, avoiding recursive applications as much as possible .This extension speeded up the performance of Preprocessing significantly .Syntactic AnalysisThe processor for Syntactic Analysis is a parser based on Tomita 's algorithm (cf.
Tomita [11]), with modifi-cations for disambiguation during parsing .
Syntactic Analysis data consist of X-bar based phrase structur egrammars and preparse patterns for each of the three languages, English, Japanese, and Spanish .
Syntacti cAnalysis outputs F-structures (grammatical relations), along the lines of Lexical-Functional Grammar (cf .Bresnan [7]), as shown in Figure 3 .
The Semantic Interpretation module is interleaved for disambiguatio n208(SWIM((CATEGORY .

by pattern matching, and sending these to the parse ras chunks .
These preparse chunks are parsed prior to main parsing using the same grammars, and thei routput consists of F-structures as well .?

PP's : start production [in january 1990] with production of 20,000 iro nIn order to test the progress of grammar development and pinpoint trouble spots, automatic evaluatio nof grammars was used .
SRA adapted the community-wide program Parseval (cf.
Black, et al.
[6]) for usein Japanese in addition to English .
Testing on Japanese was limited, since there are not many brackete dJapanese texts to use as answer keys .Semantic InterpretationSemantic Interpretation uses a language-independent processing module, and its data are predicate-argumen tmapping rules for each verb, plus both core and domain knowledge bases .

It outputs semantic structures, i .e .predicate-argument and modification relations, as shown in Figure 4 .
The predicate-argument mapping rule s(i .e .
rules which map F-structures to semantic structures) are acquired automatically (cf .
Aone and McKee[3]) .
Domain knowledge bases, on the other hand, were acquired manually .
However, a new rapid knowledg eacquisition tool called KATooI was used to link a lexical entry to its corresponding semantic concept in th eknowledge bases (cf.
Figure 5) .If a full parse cannot be created, SOLOMON uses a fragment combination strategy .
Debris Parsingand its subsequent process, Debris Semantics, work together to obtain the best interpretation from sentencefragments .
They use as data the grammars and knowledge bases, and they output semantic structures jus tlike when a full parse is created .
Debris Parsing retrieves the largest and most preferred constituents fromthe parse stack .
It then reparses the rest of the input, and creates debris F-structures with the best fragmen tconstituents .
Debris Semantics relies on the semantic interpreter to process each fragment, and then fit sfragments together using semantic constraints on unfilled slots .Discourse AnalysisDiscourse Analysis, which was redesigned and implemented this year (cf .
Aone and McKee [4]), performsreference resolution .
Discourse Analysis uses a data-driven architecture to achieve language-independence ,domain-independence, and extensibility .
It employs a single language-independent, domain-independen tprocessor, and several discourse knowledge bases, some of which are shared among different languages .
Theoutput, of Discourse Analysis is a set of semantic structures with coreference links added, i .e .
File Cards(cf.
Heim [9]) .
Discourse phenomena handled for the joint venture domain include name anaphora (e .g .

and definite NP's such as "THE NE W('OMPAN lThe system traces for English and Japanese walkthrough examples are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 .In the English example, the two instances of name anaphora for "Bridgestone Sports Co." are recognized ,while in the Japanese example, all the references to "Tokyo Kaijou Kasai Hoken, " including appositives, ar eresolved .Pragmatic Inferencin gPragmatic Inferencing performs reasoning in order to derive implicit information from the text, using aforward chainer and inference rules .
Pragmatic Inferencing outputs semantic structures, with inferred infor-inat ion added .
It infers additional information from "literal" meanings as required for application domains .For instance, in the walkthrough example, in order to infer "THE TAIWAN UNIT " is a joint venturecompany frorr, the phrase "THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TAIWAN UNIT" the following rule is used .
(defrule rule-0009 ((?event) (?event) ):example ("PNI and SRA established a new company ."
):if (and (establish ?event )(theme ?event ?x )(company ?x) ):then (and (tie-up-event ?event )(joint-venture-company ?x )(joint-venture-company ?event ?x )(in-jv-event ?x ?event)))212It is easy for developers to add, change or remove inferred information due to the declarative nature o fthe inference rules .
For instance, to get an additional tie-up from "Company A and Company B tied wit hCompany C " , in ,t, ty-000''2, we just, had to add another rule to infer that.
when companies "tie," they form atie-up .
(defrule rule-0017b ((?event) (?event) ):example ("PNI tied with SRA"):if (and (tie-event ?event )(not (theme ?event ?z) )(agent ?event ?x )(company ?x )(co-theme ?event ?y )(company ?y) ):then (tie-up-event ?event) )ExtractThe Extract module performs template generation, translating the domain-relevant portions of our language -independent semantic structures into database records .
We maintain a strong distinction between processin gand data even in template generation .
Thus, we use the same processing module to output in differen tlanguages and to several database schemata, including to a flat template-style schema as in MUC-4 and t oa more object-oriented schema as in MUC-5 .To do the actual template filling, we rely on Extract data made up of kb-object/slot to db-table/fiel dmapping rules and conversion functions for the individual values (e .g .
set fills, string fills) .
For example, th e#nationality slot of an #ORGANIZATION object in our knowledge base corresponds to the Nationalit yfield of the Entity object in the MUC-5 template .REUSABILITY OF THE SYSTE MSOLOMON is designed for reusability .
Each processing module is data-driven and reusable in other lan-guages and other domains, as well as in applications other than data extraction (e .g .
machine translation ,abstracting, summarization) .
A large portion of the data is also reusable in :?
Other languages and domains- Core knowledge bases?
Other domains- Morphological data-General lexiconsGeneral pattern data (e .g .
date, location, personal name, organization name )GrammarsSome of the discourse knowledge sources?
Other language s- Domain knowledge bases213Figure 8 : Reusability of SRA ' s MUC-5 System?

Extract (template generation) dat aThe data acquisition tools and techniques are also reusable in other languages and domains .
The statis-tical techniques used to derive lexical information can be reused for other domains .
LEXTooI, the lexiconacquisition tool, is multilingual and relies on system data files for category and morphological informa-tion.
KBTooI, the knowledge base acquisition tool, is language-independent just as the knowledge bases ar elanguage-independent .
KATool, the knowledge acquisition tool that links lexicon entries with the appropri-ate knowledge base concepts, is entirely data-driven as well, and is therefore completely reusable .
Figure 8summarizes the reusability of SRA ' s MUC-5 system .TEST RESULTS AND ANALYSISOur MUC-5 results for the English and Japanese joint-venture domain task are shown in Table 1 .
We spen t10 .55 person-months for this task, most of which were devoted to data development for both languages (se eTable 2) .
The "other" category includes time spent on developing language-independent data such as ajoint-venture domain knowledge base, pragmatic inference rules, and Extract data for template generation .We believe that the results do not indicate the potential of our system, since the system performance fo rboth languages was still improving after five months of development.
Much of the work we did resulted inlong-term improvements to our overall text understanding capability, all of which will ensure a stronger basesystem for future applications .
This implies that although the development cycle for data extraction systemusing a text understanding system may be slower in its current maturity stage, the potential for such a syste mis still unknown and represents a most promising avenue for development .
We are particularly pleased wit hthe success of our Japanese system : no other Japanese MUC-5 site is using the full understanding approach ,but we did as well and our performance continues to improve )Staff time was the major limiting factor .
We needed more time to perform more testing and evaluationl In the 18-month Tipster evaluation, the highest JJV F-measure was about 40 .214Englis hERR UND OVG SUB REC PREALL OBJECTSMATCHED ONLYTEXT F ILTERIN(.8048-662 8252 687342 3-2 25 6744 97 19 3I'&R 2I'&R I'&2H.F-MEASURE 30 .80 39 .56 25 .22JapaneseERR UND OVG SUB REC PREALL OBJECT SMATCHED ONLYTEXT FILTERING7043-5 32 8634912 01 4-386 1_945 27898P&R 2P&R P&2RF-MEASURE 43 .92 48 .74 39 .97Table 1 : SRA 's Scores for the English and Japanese Joint Venture Domai ntask person-monthsEJV 3 .

We discoveredwe were hampered by formatting errors, and in addition considerable information was "understood" by th esystem all the way through, but was not extracted by the template generator .
Since the discourse modul ewas new, it would have been helpful to have additional time to test and expand it .
In addition, we neede dmore time to fill the OWNERSHIP, REVENUE, and TIME objects, which we simply did not output .CONCLUSIONOverall, the data-driven architecture in SOLOMON allowed for minimum work on processing modules whe nworking on different languages and domains.
We ported the system to Spanish in a week for the demonstra-tion given, at the MUC-5 conference .Although we successfully acquired large amounts of domain data from domain texts in both languages ,using both statistical methods and newly developed user-friendly knowledge acquisition tools, we recogniz ethe need to move even more quickly to new domains and languages .
We plan to continue our work onautomatic acquisition of lexicons, knowledge bases, and links between them in multiple languages .Tuning performance of each module (e .g.
parsing, discourse analysis) as well as the' performance o fthe whole system to a particular task more rapidly is another research issue we identified .
We believe thatdeveloping automatic evaluation and training algorithms for such automated module/system tuning is crucia lto develop a data extraction system that produces optimal results .21 5ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe are indebted to Rajeev Agarwal, Debbie Sanders, and Vera Zlatarski for their hard work and dedicatio nin data development, module testing, and more .
