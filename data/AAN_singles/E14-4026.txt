Proceedings of the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 133?137,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 26-30 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsChinese Temporal Tagging with HeidelTimeHui Li and Jannik Str?otgen and Julian Zell and Michael GertzInstitute of Computer Science, Heidelberg UniversityIm Neuenheimer Feld 348, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany{hui.li,stroetgen,zell,gertz}@informatik.uni-heidelberg.deAbstractTemporal information is important formany NLP tasks, and there has been ex-tensive research on temporal tagging witha particular focus on English texts.
Re-cently, other languages have also been ad-dressed, e.g., HeidelTime was extended toprocess eight languages.
Chinese temporaltagging has achieved less attention, and noChinese temporal tagger is publicly avail-able.
In this paper, we address the full taskof Chinese temporal tagging (extractionand normalization) by developing ChineseHeidelTime resources.
Our evaluation ona publicly available corpus ?
which wealso partially re-annotated due to its ratherlow quality ?
demonstrates the effective-ness of our approach, and we outperforma recent approach to normalize temporalexpressions.
The Chinese HeidelTime re-source as well as the corrected corpus aremade publicly available.1 IntroductionTemporal information plays a crucial role in manydocuments, and temporal tagging, i.e., the extrac-tion of temporal expressions and their normaliza-tion to some standard format, is crucial for sev-eral NLP tasks.
So far, research on temporal in-formation extraction mostly focused on westernlanguages, especially English.
In contrast, easternlanguages, e.g., Chinese, are less explored.
Nev-ertheless, there is research on Chinese temporaltagging.
While some works addressed either theextraction or the normalization subtask, a few fulltemporal taggers exist, e.g., CTEMP (Wu et al.,2005b) and CTAT (Jing et al., 2008), but none ofthem is publicly available.In contrast, some temporal taggers were re-cently made available, e.g., DANTE (Mazur andDale, 2009), TipSem (Llorens et al., 2010), andHeidelTime (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013).
Further-more, Str?otgen et al.
(2013) showed that Hei-delTime can be extended to further languagesby developing language-specific resources with-out modifying the source code.
Thus, when de-veloping temporal tagging capabilities for an ad-ditional language, one is faced with the questionof whether to develop a new temporal tagger orto extend an existing one.
We decided to extendHeidelTime for Chinese for the following reasons:(i) HeidelTime was the best temporal tagger inthe TempEval-2 (English) and TempEval-3 (En-glish and Spanish) competitions (Verhagen et al.,2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), (ii) it already sup-ports eight languages, and (iii) it is the only multi-lingual temporal tagger for cross-domain temporaltagging, e.g., news- and narrative-style documentscan be processed with high quality.2 Related WorkFor Chinese temporal tagging, machine learningand rule-based approaches have been employed.Wu et al.
(2005a) and Wu (2010) report that ma-chine learning techniques do not achieve as goodresults as rule-based approaches when processingChinese.
Thus, it is reasonable to extend a rule-based system such as HeidelTime to Chinese.In general, temporal tagging approaches per-form the extraction, the normalization, or both,and create TIDES TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) orTimeML?s TIMEX3 (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) an-notations.
For development and evaluation, thereare two Chinese temporally annotated corpora,the ACE 2005 training corpus and TempEval-2(c.f.
Section 3).
Table 1 lists approaches to Chi-nese temporal tagging with some further infor-mation.
The most recent work is the learning-based language-independent discriminative pars-ing approach for normalizing temporal expres-sions by Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).133approach tasks method standard evaluation details system availableAngeli and Uszkoreit (2013) N ML TIMEX3 TempEval-2 (N) noWu (2010)#E rules TIMEX2 ACE 2007 (E) noWen (2010)#N rules TIMEX2 own corpus (N) noHe (2009)#E ML+rules TIMEX2 ACE 2005 (E) noPan (2008)#E ML+rules TIMEX2 ACE 2005 (E) noJing et al.

ATEL E ML+rules TIMEX2 TERN 2004 (E) noTable 1: Information on related work addressing Chinese temporal tagging (#available in Chinese only).There are also (semi-)automatic approaches toport a temporal tagger from one language to an-other.
For instance, TERSEO (Negri et al., 2006;Saquete et al., 2006) has been extended fromSpanish to English and Italian by automatic rule-translation and automatically developed parallelcorpora.
However, the normalization quality ofthis approach was rather low compared to a rule-based tagger manually developed for the specificlanguage (Negri, 2007).
This finding encour-aged us to manually create Chinese HeidelTimeresources instead of trying automatic methods.3 The TempEval-2 Chinese CorpusThere are two Chinese temporally annotated cor-pora available: While the Chinese part of the ACE2005 multilingual training corpus (Walker et al.,2006) has been used by some approaches (c.f.
Ta-ble 1), it only contains TIMEX2 extent annota-tions.
In contrast, the TempEval-2 Chinese datasets (Verhagen et al., 2010) contain TIMEX3 an-notations with extent and normalization informa-tion.
However, no TempEval-2 participants ad-dressed Chinese and only Angeli and Uszkoreit(2013) report evaluation results on this corpus.Since HeidelTime is TIMEX3-compliant, and weaddress the extraction and normalization subtasks,we use the TempEval-2 corpus in our work.3.1 Annotation Standard TimeMLFor temporal expressions, TimeML (Pustejovskyet al., 2005) contains TIMEX3 tags with severalattributes.
The two most important ones ?
alsoannotated in the TempEval-2 data ?
are type andvalue.
Type specifies if an expression is a date,time, duration, or set (set of times), and value con-tains the normalized meaning in standard format.3.2 Original TempEval-2 CorpusThe Chinese training and test sets consist of 44 and15 documents with 746 and 190 temporal expres-sions, respectively.
However, several expressionshave no normalized value information (85 in thetraining and 47 in the test set), others no type.1This issue was also reported by Angeli andUszkoreit (2013).
Thus, they report evaluation re-sults on two versions of the data sets, the originalversion and a cleaned version, in which all expres-sions without value information were removed.3.3 Re-annotation of the TempEval-2 CorpusDue to the significant amount of temporal expres-sions with undefined value attributes, we decidedto manually assign normalized values to these ex-pressions instead of excluding them.
During thisprocess, we recognized that the corpus containedseveral more errors, e.g., some expressions wereannotated as dates although they refer to durations.Thus, instead of only substituting undefined val-ues, we checked all annotations in the two datasets and corrected errors.
For this, one Chinese na-tive and two further TimeML experts discussed allmodified annotations.
Although there were sev-eral difficult expressions and not all normaliza-tions were straightforward, we significantly im-proved the annotation quality.
After our modifi-cation, the improved training and test sets contain765 and 193 temporal expressions with value in-formation, respectively.
In Table 2, statistics aboutthe three versions of the data sets are provided.4 Chinese HeidelTime ResourcesHeidelTime is a cross-domain, multilingual tem-poral tagger that strictly separates the sourcecode and language-dependent resources (Str?otgenand Gertz, 2013).
While the implementationtakes care of domain-dependent normalization is-sues, language-dependent resources contain pat-tern, normalization, and rule files.
We had to de-velop such Chinese resources to perform Chinesetemporal tagging with HeidelTime.1Note that the TempEval-2 corpus developers stated thatthe annotations of the non-English documents are rather ex-perimental (Verhagen, 2011).134temp.

For most of thesupported languages, HeidelTime uses a UIMAwrapper of the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
Sincethere is also a Chinese model for the TreeTaggeravailable, we rely on the TreeTagger for Chineselinguistic preprocessing.24.2 Resource Development ProcessTo develop Chinese HeidelTime resources, wefollowed the strategy applied by Str?otgen et al.
(2013) for Spanish: Using HeidelTime?s Englishresources as starting point, we translated the pat-tern files, the normalization files, and the rules forextracting and normalizing temporal expressions.More details on these steps are provided next.Pattern & Normalization Resources.
Englishpatterns in the pattern files, which also exist inChinese in a similar form, were directly trans-lated.
For instance, there are Chinese expressionsfor names of months and weekdays.
Patterns ex-isting in English but not used in Chinese were re-moved, e.g., there are no abbreviations of monthnames in Chinese.
In contrast, for other patternsfrequently used in Chinese, additional pattern fileswere created.
Examples are Chinese numerals.Based on the pattern files, we built the normal-ization files.
Here, the normalized values of thepatterns are stored.
An example of the Chineseresources is as follows: The three patterns ????
?, ????
?, and ????
can all be trans-lated as Tuesday and are thus part of the Weekdaypattern resource.
Since weekdays are internallyhandled by HeidelTime with their English names,the normalization file for Chinese weekdays con-tains ????,Tuesday?
????,Tuesday?
and??
?,Tuesday?.2http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/tools/zh/.Chinese Rule Development.
HeidelTime?srules contain three components, a name, an ex-traction and a normalization part.
The extractionmainly makes use of regular expressions and thepattern resources, and in the normalization part,the matched expressions are normalized using thenormalization resources.3To develop the rules,we again followed Str?otgen et al.
(2013) andapplied the following strategy:(i) A few simple Chinese rules were createdbased on the English rules.
(ii) We reviewed ex-tracted temporal expressions in the training set andimproved the extraction and normalization parts ofthe rules.
(iii) We checked the training texts forundetected expressions and created rules to matchthem.
In parallel, we adapted the Chinese patternand normalization resources when necessary.
(iv)We translated more complex English rules to alsocover valid expressions not occurring in the Chi-nese training documents.
(v) Steps (ii) to (iv) wereiteratively performed until the results on the train-ing set could not be improved further.4.3 Chinese ChallengesChinese is an isolating language without inflectionand depends on word order and function wordsto represent grammatical relations.
Although weonly consider modern Mandarin as it is the mostwidely used variety of Chinese in contemporarytexts, many challenges occurred during the re-source development process.
Some examples are:Polysemous words: Many Chinese words havemore than one meaning, e.g., dynasty names suchas ???
(Tang) or ???
(Song) can refer to a certaintime period, but also appear as family names.Further ambiguities: There are many ambigu-ous expressions in Chinese, e.g., the temporal ex-pression ?????
has two meanings: ?before the5th day of a certain month?
and also ?5 days ago??
depending on the context.Calendars: There are various calendars in Chi-nese culture and thus also in Chinese texts, suchas the lunar calendar and the 24 solar terms, whichare different from the Gregorian calendar and thusvery difficult to normalize.
Besides, Taiwan hasa different calendar, which numbers the year fromthe founding year of the Republic of China (1911).3For more details about HeidelTime?s system architectureand rule syntax, we refer to Str?otgen and Gertz (2013).135training set P R F value typeoriginal 96.1 92.7 94.4 80 93AU13-clean 80.7 95.1 87.3 91 95improved 97.6 94.4 96.0 92 95test set P R F value typeoriginal 93.4 82.0 87.3 70 93AU13-clean 63.5 88.0 73.8 89 96improved 95.5 83.8 89.3 87 96Table 3: Evaluation results for extraction and nor-malization (TempEval-2 training and test sets).5 EvaluationIn this section, we present evaluation results of ournewly developed Chinese HeidelTime resources.In addition, we compare our results for the normal-ization sub-task to Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).5.1 Evaluation SetupCorpus: We use three versions of the TempEval-2 training and test sets: (i) the original versions,(ii) the improved versions described in Section 3.3,and (iii) the cleaned versions also used by Angeliand Uszkoreit (2013) in which temporal expres-sions without value information are removed.Setting: Since the TempEval-2 data already con-tains sentence and token information, we onlyhad to perform part-of-speech tagging as linguisticpreprocessing step.
For this, we used the TreeTag-ger (Schmid, 1994) with its Chinese model.Measures: We use the official TempEval-2 eval-uation script.
For the extraction, precision, recall,and f-score are calculated on the token-level.
Forthe normalization, accuracy for the attributes typeand value are calculated on the expression-level.Note that the use of accuracy makes it difficult tocompare systems having a different recall in theextraction, as will be explained below.5.2 Evaluation ResultsTable 3 (top) shows the evaluation results on thetraining set.
Extraction and normalization qualityare high, and value accuracies of over 90% on thecleaned and improved versions are promising.4The results on the test sets (Table 3, bottom) arelower than on the training sets.
However, value ac-curacies of almost 90% with a recall of more than80% are valuable and comparable to state-of-the-art systems in other languages.
A first error anal-ysis revealed that while the training documents4Note that the lower value accuracy on the original setis due to expressions without value information in the goldstandard, and that the low extraction precision in the cleanversion is due to some of those expressions being (correctly)extracted by the system but removed from the gold standard.original AU13-clean # correcttraining set value type value type valueAU13 65% 95% 73% 97% 4845HeidelTime 80% 93% 91% 95% 574original AU13-clean # correcttest set value type value type valueAU13 48% 87% 60% 97% 865HeidelTime 70% 93% 89% 96% 121Table 4: Normalization only ?
comparison toAU13 (Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013).are written in modern Mandarin, some test doc-uments contain Taiwan-specific expressions (c.f.Section 4.3) not covered by our rules yet.Finally, we compare the normalization qualityof our approach to the multilingual parsing ap-proach of Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013).
How-ever, their approach performs only the normaliza-tion subtask assuming that the extents of temporalexpressions are provided.
For this, they used goldextents for evaluation.
HeidelTime only normal-izes those expressions that it knows how to extract.Thus, we run HeidelTime performing the extrac-tion and the normalization.
However, since theaccuracy measure used by the TempEval-2 scriptcalculates the ratio of correctly normalized expres-sions to all extracted expressions and not to allexpressions in the gold standard, we additionallypresent the raw numbers of correctly normalizedexpressions for the two systems.
Table 4 shows thecomparison between our approach and the one byAngeli and Uszkoreit (2013).
We outperform theirapproach not only with respect to the accuracy butalso with respect to the numbers of correctly nor-malized expressions (574 vs. 4845and 121 vs. 865on the training and test sets, respectively) ?
despitethe fact that we perform the full task of temporaltagging and not only the normalization.6 Conclusions & Ongoing WorkIn this paper, we addressed Chinese temporaltagging by developing Chinese HeidelTime re-sources.
These make HeidelTime the first publiclyavailable Chinese temporal tagger.
Our evaluationshowed the high quality of the new HeidelTime re-sources, and we outperform a recent normalizationapproach.
Furthermore, the re-annotated ChineseTempEval-2 data sets will also be made available.Currently, we are performing a detailed erroranalysis and hope to gain insights to further im-prove HeidelTime?s Chinese resources.5Number of correct value normalizations calculated basedon value accuracy and number of expressions in the data sets.136ReferencesGabor Angeli and Jakob Uszkoreit.
