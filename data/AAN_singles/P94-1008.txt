COMMON TOPICS  AND COHERENT S ITUAT IONS:INTERPRET ING ELL IPS IS  IN THE CONTEXT OFD ISCOURSE INFERENCEAndrew Keh lerHarvard UniversityAiken Computat ion  Laboratory33 Oxford StreetCambridge,  MA 02138kehler@das.harvard.eduAbst rac tIt is claimed that a variety of facts concerning ellip-sis, event reference, and interclausal coherence can beexplained by two features of the linguistic form in ques-tion: (1) whether the form leaves behind an emptyconstituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the formis anaphoric in the semantics.
It is proposed that thesefeatures interact with one of two types of discourse in-ference, namely Common Topic inference and CoherentSituation inference.
The differing ways in which thesetypes of inference utilize syntactic and semantic repre-sentations predicts phenomena for which it is otherwisedifficult o account.In t roduct ionEllipsis is pervasive in natural language, and hence hasreceived much attention within both computational andtheoretical linguistics.
However, the conditions underwhich a representation f an utterance may serve asa suitable basis for interpreting subsequent ellipticalforms remain poorly understood; specifically, past at-tempts to characterize these processes within a singletraditional module of language processing (e.g., consid-ering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation)have failed to account for all of the data.
In this paper,we claim that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis res-olution, event reference, and interclausal coherence canbe explained by the interaction between the syntacticand semantic properties of the form in question and thetype of discourse inference operative in establishing thecoherence of the antecedent and elided clauses.In the next section, we introduce the facts concerninggapping, VP-ellipsis, and non-elliptical event referencethat we seek to explain.
In Section 3, we categorizeelliptical and event referential forms according to twofeatures: (1) whether the expression leaves behind anempty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether theexpression is anaphoric in the semantics.
In Section 4we describe two types of discourse inference, namelyCommon Topic inference and Coherent Situation in-ference, and make a specific proposal concerning theinterface between these and the syntactic and seman-tic representations they utilize.
In Section 5, we showhow this proposal accounts for the data presented inSection 2.
We contrast he account with relevant pastwork in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.E l l ips i s  and  In terc lausa l  CoherenceIt has been noted in previous work that the felicity ofcertain forms of ellipsis is dependent on the type of co-herence relationship extant between the antecedent andelided clauses (Levin and Prince, 1982; Kehler, 1993b).In this section we review the relevant facts for two suchforms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, andalso compare these with facts concerning non-ellipticalevent reference.Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence(henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision ofall but two constituents (and in limited circumstances,more than two constituents) in one or more subsequenttarget sentences, as exemplified in sentence (1):(1) Bill became upset, and Hillary angry.We are concerned here with a particular fact about gap-ping noticed by Levin and Prince (1982), namely thatgapping is acceptable only with the purely conjunc-tive symmetric meaning of and conjoining the clauses,and not with its causal asymmetric meaning (para-phraseable by "and as a result").
That is, while eitherof sentences (1) or (2) can have the purely conjunctivereading, only sentence (2) can be understood to meanthat Hillary's becoming angry was caused by or cameas a result of Bill's becoming upset.
(2) Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry.This can be seen by embedding each of these examplesin a context hat reinforces one of the meanings.
Forinstance, gapping is felicitous in passage (3), where con-text supports the symmetric reading, but is infelicitousin passage (4) under the intended causal meaning ofand.
11This behavior is not limited to the conjunction and; asimilar distinction holds between symmetric and asymmet-ric uses of or and but.
See Kehler (1994) for further discus-sion.50(3) The Clintons want to get the national debate fo-cussed on health care, and are getting annoyedbecause the media is preoccupied with Whitewa-ter.
When a reporter ecently asked a Whitewaterquestion at a health care rally, Bill became upset,and Hillary became/0 angry.
(4) Hillary has been getting annoyed at Bill for his in-ability to deflect controversy and do damage con-trol.
She has repeatedly told him that the wayto deal with Whitewater is to play it down andnot to overreact.
When a reporter ecently askeda Whitewater question at a health care rally, Billbecame upset, and (as a result) Hillary became/#angry.The common stipulation within the literature statingthat gapping applies to coordinate structures and notto subordinate ones does not account for why any co-ordinated cases are unacceptable.VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sen-tence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bareauxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase:(5) Bill became upset, and Hillary did too.The distribution of VP-ellipsis has also been shownto be sensitive to the coherence relationship extant be-tween the source and target clauses, but in a differ-ent respect.
In a previous paper (Kehler, 1993b), fivecontexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determinewhether the representations retrieved are syntactic orsemantic in nature.
Evidence was given that VP-ellipsiscopies syntactic representations in what was termedparallelconstructions (predicting the unacceptability ofthe voice mismatch in example (6) and nominalizedsource in example (8)), but copies semantic represen-tations in non-parallel constructions (predicting the ac-ceptability of the voice mismatch in example (7) andthe nominalized source in example (9)): 2(6) # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and theICC did too.

\[ reverse the decision \]An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference mustaccount for this distinction.In sum, the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsisappears to be dependent on the type of coherence re-lation extant between the source and target clauses.Pronominal event reference, on the other hand, appearsnot to display this dependence.
We seek to account forthese facts in the sections that follow.Syntax  and  Semant ics  o f  E l l ips i s  andEvent  ReferenceIn this section we characterize the forms being ad-dressed in terms of two features: (1) whether the formleaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and(2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics.
Insubsequent sections, we show how the distinct mecha-nisms for recovering these types of missing informationinteract with two types of discourse inference to predictthe phenomena noted in the previous ection.We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semanticproperties of these forms using the version of Catego-rial Semantics described in Pereira (1990).
In the Mon-tagovian tradition, semantic representations are com-positionaUy generated in correspondence with the con-stituent modification relationships manifest in the syn-tax; predicates are curried.
Traces are associated withassumptions which are subsequently discharged by asuitable construction.
Figure 1 shows the representa-tions for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serveas the initial source clause representation for the exam-ples that follow.
3For our analysis of gapping, we follow Sag (1976) inhypothesizing that a post-surface-structure level of syn-tactic representation is used as the basis for interpreta-tion.
In source clauses of gapping constructions, con-stituents in the source that are parallel to the overt con-stituents in the target are abstracted out of the clauserepresentation.
4 For simplicity, we will assume that3We will ignore the tense of the predicates for ease ofexposition.4It has been noted that in gapping constructions, con-trastive accent is generally placed on parallel elements in51S: become '(upset ')(Bill')NP: Bill' VP: beeome'(upset')Bill: Bill' V: become' AP: upset'I Ibec~ame: b cx~me' upset: upset'Figure 1: Syntactic and Semantic Representations forBill became upset.this abstraction is achieved by fronting the constituentsin the post-surface-structure, although nothing muchhinges on this; our analysis is compatible with severalpossible mechanisms.
The syntactic and semantic rep-resentations for the source clause of example (1) afterfronting are shown in Figure 2; the fronting leaves traceassumptions behind that are discharged when combinedwith their antecedents.S: bccomc'(upsct'XBill') \[tracc-abs\]hiP: Bill' S: beeome'(upset'X t o \[trae~abs\]Bill: Bill' ~ :  upset' S: become'(tuX tb)upset: upset' NP:t b \[~'ace-licl VP: become'(tu)t6 V: become' AP:t u \[Iraee-lic\]I Ibee~me: become' 6Figure 2: Syntactic and Semantic Representations forBill became upset after fronting.Target clauses in gapping constructions are thereforerepresented with the overt constituents fronted out ofan elided sentence node; for instance the representationof the target clause in example (1) is shown in Figure 3both the target and the source clauses, and that abstractingthese elements results in an "open proposition" that bothclauses share (Sag, 1976; Prince, 1986; Steedman, 1990).This proposition needs to be presupposed (or accommo-dated) for the gapping to be felicitous, for instance, it wouldbe infelicitous to open a conversation with sentence such as(1), whereas it is perfectly felicitous in response to the ques-tion How did the Clintons react?.
Gapping resolution canbe characterized asthe restoration of this open propositionin the gapped clause.

The empty con-s:NP: Hillary' S:HiUary: Hinary' AP: angry' S:I Iangry: angry' ~5Figure 3: Syntactic and Semantic Representations forHillary angry.stituent is reconstructed by copying the embedded sen-tence from the source to the target clause, along withparallel trace assumptions which are to be bound withinthe target.
The semantics for this embedded sentenceis the open proposition that the two clauses hare.
Thissemantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copyingthe syntax, as gapping does not result in an indepen-dently anaphoric expression in the semantics.
~ In fact,as can be seen from Figure 3, before copying takes placethere is no sentence-level semantics for gapped clausesat all.Like gapping, VP-ellipsis results in an empty con-stituent in the syntax, in this case, a verb phrase.
How-ever, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an inde-pendently anaphoric form in the semantics.

For instance, unlike VP-ellipsis and overt pro-nouns, gapping cannot be cataphoric, and can only obtainits antecedent from the immediately preceding clause.6Unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis patterns with other types ofanaphora, for instance it can be cataphoric and can locateantecedents from clauses other than the most immediateone .52one of two ways.
The syntactic VP could be copieddown with its corresponding semantics, from which thesemantics for the complete sentence can be derived.
Inthis case, the anaphoric expression is constrained tohave the same semantics as the copied constituent.
Al-ternatively, the anaphoric expression could be resolvedpurely semantically, resulting in the discharge of theanaphoric assumption P. The higher-order unificationmethod eveloped by Dalrymple t al.
(1991) could beused for this purpose; in this case the sentence-levelsemantics i recovered without copying any syntacticrepresentations.Event referential forms such as do it, do tha~, and doso constitute full verb phrases in the syntax.
It has beenoften noted (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, inter alia) thatit is the main verb do that is operative in these formsof anaphora, in contrast o the auxiliary do operativein VP-ellipsis/ It is the pronoun in event referentialforms that is anaphoric; the fact that the pronouns referto events results from the type constraints imposed bythe main verb do.
Therefore, such forms are anaphoricin the semantics, but do not leave behind an emptyconstituent in the syntax.To summarize this section, we have characterized theforms being addressed according to two features, a sum-mary of which appears in Table 1.
Whereas anaphoricForm Empty Node Anaphoric \[\[in Syntax in Semantics IIGapping ~/VP-Ellipsis ~/ V /Event Reference ~/Table l: Common Topic Relationsforms in the semantics for these forms are indepen-dently resolved, empty syntactic onstituents in and ofthemselves are not anaphoric, and thus may only berestored when some independently-motivated processnecessitates it.
In the section that follows we outlinetwo types of discourse inference, one of which requiressuch copying of empty constituents.D iscourse  In fe renceTo be coherent, utterances within a discourse segmentrequire more than is embodied in their individual syn-tactic and semantic representations alone; additionalrFor instance, other auxiliaries can appear in elidedforms but cannot be followed by it, tt, at, or so as in ex-ample (11), and a pronominal object to the main verb docannot refer to a state as VP-ellipsis can as in example (12).

Here we de-scribe two types of inference used to enforce the con-straints that are imposed by coherence relations.
Ineach case, arguments to coherence relations take theform of semantic representations retrieved by way oftheir corresponding node(s) in the syntax; the oper-ations performed on these representations are dictatedby the nature of the constraints imposed.
The two typesof inference are distinguished by the level in the syntaxfrom which these arguments are retrieved, sCommon Topic In fe renceUnderstanding segments of utterances standing in aCommon Topic relation requires the determinationof points of commonality (parallelism) and departure(contrast) between sets of corresponding entities andproperties within the utterances.
This process is relianton performing comparison and generalization opera-tions on the corresponding representations (Scha andPolanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993).Table 2 sketches definitions for some Common Topicrelations, some taken from and others adapted fromHobbs (1990).
In each case, the hearer is to understandthe relation by inferring po(al, .
.
.
,  a , )  from sentence Soand inferring p1(bl, ..., bn) from sentence $1 under thelisted constraints.
9 In order to meet these constraints,the identification ofp0 and Pl may require arbitrary lev-els of generalization from the relations explicitly statedin the utterances.Examples of these relations are given in sentences(13a-d).
(13) a. John organized rallies for Clinton, and Freddistributed pamphlets for him.
(Parallel)b. John supported Clinton, but Mary supportedBush.
(Contrast)c. Young aspiring politicians usually supporttheir party's presidential candidate.
For in-stance, John campaigned hard for Clinton in1992.
(Exemplification)d. A young aspiring politician was arrested inTexas today.
John Smith, 34, was nabbed ina Houston law firm while attempting to em-bezzle funds for his campaign.
(Elaboration)Passage (13a), for instance, is coherent under the un-derstanding that John and Fred have a common prop-SHobbs (1990), following Hume (1748), suggests a clas-sification of coherence r lations into three broad cate-gories, namely Resemblance, Cause or Effect, and Contiguity(Hume's terminology).
Here, Resemblance r lations appearto pattern well with those employing our Common Topicinference, and likewise Cause or effect and Contiguity withour Coherent Situation inference.9Following Hobbs, by al and bi being similar we meanthat for some salient property qi, qi(ai) and qi(b,) holds.Likewise by dissimilar we mean that for some qi, q,(al) and"~qi (bi ) holds.53Constraints Conjunctions \[I RelationParallelContrastExemplificationElaborationPo = Pl, ai and bi are similar(1) Po = -~Pl, ai and bi are similar(2) P0 = Pl, ai and bi are dissimilar for some iPo =P l  ;bl Ea io r  b iCa iPO = pl  , ai ---- biandbutfor example 'in other wordsTable 2: Common Topic Relationserty, namely having done something to support Clin-ton.
Passage (13c) is likewise coherent by virtue of theinferences resulting from identifying parallel elementsand properties, including that John is a young aspiringpolitician and that he's a Democrat (since Clinton isidentified with his party's candidate).
The character-istic that Common Topic relations share is that theyrequire the identification of parallel entities (i.e., the aland bi) and relations (P0 and Px) as arguments to theconstraints.
We posit that the syntactic representationis used both to guide the identification of parallel ele-ments and to retrieve their semantic representations.Coherent  S i tuat ion  In fe renceUnderstanding utterances tanding in a Coherent Sit-uation relation requires that hearers convince them-selves that the utterances describe a coherent situationgiven their knowledge of the world.
This process re-quires that a path of inference be established betweenthe situations (i.e., events or states) described in theparticipating utterances as a whole, without regard toany constraints on parMlelism between sub-sententiMconstituents.
Four such relations are summarized inTable 3. l?
In all four cases, the hearer is to infer Afrom sentence $1 and B from sentence $2 under theconstraint hat the presuppositions listed be abduced(ttobbs et al, 1993): 11Relation Presuppose ConjunctionsResultExplanationViolated ExpectationDenial of PreventerA- .

(14) a.
Bill is a politician, and therefore he's dishon-est.
(Result)1?These relations are what Hume might have termedCause or Effect.11We are using implication in a very loose sense here, asif to mean "could plausibly follow from".b.
Bill is dishonest because he's a politician.(Explanation)c.
Bill is a politician, but he's honest.
(Violated Expectation)d. Bill is honest, even though he's a politician.
(Denial of Preventer)Beyond what is asserted by the two clauses individually,understanding each of these sentences requires the pre-supposition that being a politician implies being dishon-est.
Inferring this is only reliant on the sentential-levelsemantics for the clauses as a whole; there are no p, ai,or bi to be independently identified.
The same is truefor what Hume called Contiguity relations (perhaps in-eluding Hobbs' Occasion and Figure-ground relations);for the purpose of this paper we will consider these asweaker cases of Cause or Effect.To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topicinference utilizes the syntactic structure in identify-ing the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents toserve as arguments to the coherence constraints.
Incontrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only thesentential-level semantic forms as is required for ab-ducing a coherent situation.
The question then arisesas to what happens when constituents in the syntaxfor an utterance are empty.
Given that the discourseinference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms throughnodes in the syntax, this syntax will have to be recov-ered when a node being accessed is missing.
Therefore,we posit that missing constituents are recovered as aby-product of Common Topic inference, to allow theparallel properties and entities serving as arguments tothe coherence relation to be accessed from within the re-constructed structure.
On the other hand, such copyingis not triggered in Coherent Situation inference, sincethe arguments are retrieved only from the top-level sen-tence node, which is always present.
In the next section,we show how this difference accounts for the data givenin Section 2.App ly ing  the  Ana lys i sIn previous sections, we have classified several ellip-tical and event referential forms as to whether theyleave behind an empty constituent in the syntax andwhether they are anaphoric in the semantics.
Empty.constituents in the syntax are not in themselves refer-ential, but are recovered uring Common Topic infer-54ence.
Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are inde-pendently referential and are resolved through purelysemantic means regardless of the type of discourse in-ference.
In this section we show how the phenomenapresented in Section 2 follow from these properties.Local  El l ipsisRecall from Section 2 that gapping constructions suchas (15) are only felicitous with the symmetric (i.e.,Common Topic) meaning of and:(15) Bill became upset, and Hillary angry.This fact is predicted by our account in the followingway.
In the case of Common Topic constructions, themissing sentence in the target will be copied from thesource, the sentential semantics may be derived, and thearguments o the coherence relations can be identifiedand reasoning carried out, predicting felicity.
In thecase of Coherent Situation relations, no such recoveryof the syntax takes place.
Since a gapped clause in andof itself has no sentence-level semantics, the gappingfails to be felicitous in these cases.This account also explains imilar differences in fe-licity for other coordinating conjunctions as discussedin Kehler (1994), as well as why gapping is infelicitousin constructions with subordinating conjunctions indi-cating Coherent Situation relations, as exemplified in(16).
(16) # Bill became upset,{ because }even though Hillary angry.despite the fact thatThe stripping construction is similar to gapping ex-cept that there is only one bare constituent in the tar-get (also generally receiving contrastive accent); unlikeVP-ellipsis there is no stranded auxiliary.
We thereforemight predict hat stripping is also acceptable in Com-mon Topic constructions but not in Coherent Situationconstructions, which appears to be the case: 12(17) Bill became upset,but not# and (as a result)# because Hillary.# even though# despite the fact thatIn summary, gapping and related constructions areinfelicitous in those cases where Coherent Situation in-ference is employed, as there is no mechanism for re-covering the sentential semantics of the elided clause.12Stripping is also possible in comparative deletion con-structions.
A comprehensive analysis of stripping, pseudo-gapping, and VP-ellipsis in such cases requires an articula-tion of a syntax and semantics for these constructions, whichwill be carried out in future work.VP-E l l ips isRecall from Section 2 that only in Coherent Situationconstructions can VP-ellipsis obtain purely semanticantecedents without regard to constraints on structuralparallelism, as exemplified by the voice mismatches insentences (18) and (19).
(18) # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and theICC did too.
\[ reverse the decision \](19) In March, four fireworks manufacturers a kedthat the decision be reversed, and on Monday theICC did.
\[ reverse the decision \]These facts are also predicted by our account.
In thecase of Common Topic constructions, a suitable syn-tactic antecedent must be reconstructed at the site ofthe empty VP node, with the result that the anaphoricexpression takes on its accompanying semantics.
There-fore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syn-tactic antecedent in these scenarios.
In Coherent Sit-uation constructions, the empty VP node is not re-constructed.
In these cases the anaphoric expressionis resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constrained to having a suitable semanticantecedent.The analysis accounts for the range of data given inKehler (1993b), although one point of departure xistsbetween that account and the current one with respectto clauses conjoined with but.
In the previous accountthese cases are all classified as non-parallel, resulting inthe prediction that they only require semantic sourcerepresentations.
In our analysis, we expect cases of purecontrast to pattern with the parallel class since these areCommon Topic constructions; this is opposed to the vi-olated expectation use of but which indicates a CoherentSituation relation.
The current account makes the cor-rect predictions; examples (20) and (21), where but hasthe contrast meaning, appear to be markedly less ac-ceptable than examples (22) and (23), where but hasthe violated expectation meaning: 13(20) ??
Clinton was introduced by John, but Marydidn't.
\[ introduce Clinton \](21) ??
This letter provoked a response from Bush,but Clinton didn't.
\[ respond \](22) Clinton was to have been introduced by someone,but obviously nobody did.
\[ introduce Clinton \](23) This letter deserves a response, but before you do,... \[ respond \]To summarize thus far, the data presented in the ear-lier account as well as examples that conflict with thatanalysis are all predicted by the account given here.As a final note, we consider the interaction betweenVP-ellipsis and gapping.
The following pair of examplesare adapted from those of Sag (1976, pg.
291):lZThese examples have been adapted from several inKehler (1993b).55(24) :Iohn supports Clinton, and Mary $ Bush, al-though she doesn't know why she does.
(25) ??
John supports Clinton, and Mary 0 Bush, andFred does too.Sag defines an alphabeiic variance condition that cor-rectly predicts that sentence (25) is infelicitous, but in-correctly predicts that sentence (24) is also.
Sag thensuggests a weakening of his condition, with the resultthat both of the above examples are incorrectly pre-dicted to be acceptable; he doesn't consider a solutionpredicting the judgements as stated.The felicity of sentence (24) and the infelicity of sen-tence (25) are exactly what our account predicts.
Inexample (25), the third clause is in a Common Topicrelationship with the second (as well as the first) andtherefore requires that the VP be reconstructed at thetarget site.
However, the VP is not in a suitable form,as the object has been abstracted out of it (yieldinga trace assumption).
Therefore, the subsequent VP-ellipsis fails to be felicitous.
In contrast, the conjunc-tion alfhough used before the third clause in example(24) indicates a Coherent Situation relation.
Therefore,the VP in the third clause need not be reconstructed,and the subsequent semantically-based r solution of theanaphoric form succeeds.
Thus, the apparent paradoxbetween examples (24) and (25) is just what we wouldexpect.Event  ReferenceRecall that Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that whereaselliptical sentences such as (26a) are unacceptable dueto a voice mismatch, similar examples with event ref-erential forms are much more acceptable as exemplifiedby sentence (26b): 14(26) a.
# The decision was reversed by the FBI, andthe ICC did too.
\[ reverse the decision \]b.
The decision was reversed by the FBI, and theICC did it too.
\[ reverse the decision \]As stated earlier, forms such as do it are anaphoric, butleave no empty constituents in the syntax.
Therefore,it follows under the present account hat such referenceis successful without regard to the type of discourseinference mployed.Re la t ionsh ip  to  Pas t  WorkThe literature on ellipsis and event reference is volumi-nous, and so we will not attempt a comprehensive com-parison here.
Instead, we briefly compare the currentwork to three previous tudies that explicitly tie ellipsis14Sag and Hankamer claim that all such cases of VP-ellipsis require syntactic antecedents, whereas we suggestthat in Coherent Situation relations VP-eUipsis operatesmore like their Model-Interpretive Anaphora, of which doit is an example.resolution to an account of discourse structure and co-herence, namely our previous account (Kehler, 1993b)and the accounts of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993).In Kehler (1993b), we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distinguished between two types of rela-tionship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel.
Anarchitecture was presented whereby utterances wereparsed into propositional representations which weresubsequently integrated into a discourse model.
It wasposited that VP-ellipsis could access either proposi-tional or discourse model representations: in the case ofparallel constructions, the source resided in the propo-sitional representation; i  the case of non-parallel con-structions, the source had been integrated into the dis-course model.
In Kehler (1994), we showed how thisarchitecture also accounted for the facts that Levin andPrince noted about gapping.The current work improves upon that analysis in sev-eral respects.
First, it no longer needs to be positedthat syntactic representations disappear when inte-grated into the discourse model; 15 instead, syntacticand semantic representations co-exist.
Second, variousissues with regard to the interpretation of propositionalrepresentations are now rendered moot.
Third, there isno longer a dichotomy with respect o the level of repre-sentation from which VP-ellipsis locates and copies an-tecedents.
Instead, two distinct factors have been sepa-rated out: the resolution of missing constituents underCommon Topic inference is purely syntactic whereasthe resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases ispurely semantic; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsisdata arises out of the interaction between these differentphenomena.
Finally, the current approach more read-ily scales up to more complex cases.
For instance, itwas not clear in the previous account how non-parallelconstructions embedded within parallel constructionswould be handled, as in sentences (27a-b):(27) a. Clinton was introduced by John because Maryhad refused to, and Gore was too.
\[ introducedby John because Mary had refused to \]b.
# Clinton was introduced by John becauseMary had refused to, and Fred did too.
\[ in-troduced Clinton because Mary had refusedto \]The current approach accounts for these cases.The works of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993) pro-vide analyses of VP-ellipsis 16 in the context of anaccount of discourse structure and coherence.
Withl~This claim could be dispensed with in the treatmentof VP-eUipsis, perhaps at the cost of some degree of the-oretical inelegance.
However, this aspect was crucial forhandling the gapping data, since the infelicity of gapping innon-parallel constructions hinged on there no longer beinga propositional representation available as a source.16In addition, Prfist addresses gapping, and Asher ad-dresses event reference.56Priist utilizing a mixed representation (called syntac-tic/semantic structures) and Asher utilizing DiscourseRepresentation Theory constructs, each defines mecha-nisms for determining relations uch as parallelism andcontrast, and gives constraints on resolving VP-ellipsisand related forms within their more general frame-works.
However, each essentially follows Sag in requir-ing that elided VP representations be alphabetic vari-ants of their referents.
This constraint rules out caseswhere VP-ellipsis obtains yntactically mismatched an-tecedents, uch as example (19) and other non-parallelcases given in Kehler (1993b).
It also appears that nei-ther approach can account for the infelicity of mixedgapping/VP-ellipsis cases such as sentence (25).Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have categorized several forms of el-lipsis and event reference according to two features: (1)whether the form leaves behind an empty constituentin the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoricin the semantics.
We have also described two forms ofdiscourse inference, namely Common Topic inferenceand Coherent Situation inference.
The interaction be-tween the two features and the two types of discourseinference predicts facts concerning apping, VP-ellipsis,event reference, and interclausal coherence for which itis otherwise difficult to account.
In future work we willaddress other forms of ellipsis and event reference, aswell as integrate a previous account of strict and sloppyambiguity into this framework (Kehler, 1993a).AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by National ScienceFoundation Grant IRI-9009018, National Science Foun-dation Grant IRI-9350192, and a grant from the XeroxCorporation.
