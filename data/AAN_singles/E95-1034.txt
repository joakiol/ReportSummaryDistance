I n tegrat ing  "Free" Word  Order  Syntaxand  In fo rmat ion  S t ructureBeryl Hoffman*Dept.
of Computer and Information ScienceUniversity of Pennsylvania(hoffman@linc.cis.upenn.edu)AbstractMultiset-CCG is a combinatory catego-rial formalism that can capture the syn-tax and interpretation of "free" word or-der in languages uch as Turkish.
Theformalism compositionally derives thepredicate-argument structure and the in-formation structure (e.g.
topic, focus)of a sentence, and uniformly handlesword order variation among argumentsand adjuncts within a clause, as wellas in complex clauses and across clauseboundaries.1 IntroductionIn this paper, I present a categorial formalism,Multiset CCG (based on Combinatory CategorialGrammars (Steedman, 1985; Steedman, 1991)),that captures the syntax and context-dependentinterpretation of "free" word order in languagessuch as Turkish.
Word order variation in rela-tively free word order languages, such as Czech,Finnish, German, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, isused to convey distinctions in meaning that gobeyond traditional propositional semantics.
Theword order in these languages erves to structurethe information being conveyed to the hearer, e.g.by indicating what is the topic and the focus of thesentence (as will be defined in the next section).
Infixed word order languages uch as English, theseare indicated largely through intonation and stressrather than word order.The context-appropriate use of "free" word or-der is of considerable importance in developingpractical applications in natural language gener-ation, machine translation, and machine-assistedtranslation.
I have implemented a database querysystem in Prolog, described in (Hoffman, 1994),which uses Multiset CCG to interpret and gen:crate Turkish sentences with context-appropriateword orders.
Here, I concentrate on further devel-*I would like to thank Mark Steedman, EllenPrince, and the support of NSF Grant SBR 8920230.oping the formalism, especially to handle complexsentences.There have been other formalisms that inte-grate information structure into the grammar for"free" word order languages, e.g.
(Sgall et al1986; Engdahl/Vallduvi, 1994; Steinberger, 1994).However, I believe my approach is the first totackle complex sentences with embedded infor-mation structures and discontinuous constituents.Multiset CCG can handle free word order amongarguments and adjuncts in all clauses, as wellas word order variation across clause boundaries,i.e.
long distance scrambling.
The advantageof using a combinatory categorial formalism isthat it provides a compositional nd flexible sur-face structure, which allows syntactic onstituentsto easily correspond with information structureunits.
A novel characteristic of this approachis that the context-appropriate use of word or-der is captured by compositionally building thepredicate-argument structure (AS) and the infor-mation structure (IS) of a sentence in parallel.After presenting the motivating Turkish datain Section 2, I present a competence grammar forTurkish in Section 3 that captures the basic syn-tactic and semantic relationships between predi-cates and their arguments or adjuncts while al-lowing "free" word order.
This grammar, whichderives the predicate-argument structure is thenintegrated with the information structure in Sec-tion 4.
In Section 5, the formalism is extended toaccount for complex sentences and long distancescrambling.2 The Turkish DataThe arguments of a verb in Turkish (as wellas many other "free" word order languages) donot have to occur in a fixed word order.
Forinstance, all six permutations of the transitivesentence below are possible, since case-marking,rather than word order, serves to differentiate thearguments, aaThe accusative, dative, genitive, ablative, andlocative cases are associated with specific morphemes245(1) a.

GSrdfi Ahmet'i Fatma.f.
GSrdii Fatma Ahmet'i.Although all the permutations have the samepropositional interpretation, see(Fatma, Ahmet),each word order conveys a different discoursemeaning only appropriate to a specific dis-course situation.
We can generally associate thesentence-initial position with the topic, the im-mediately preverbal position with the focus whichreceives the primary stress in the sentence, andpostverbal positions with backgrounded informa-tion (Erguvanli, 1984).
The post-verbal positionsare influenced by the given/new status of enti-ties within the discourse; postverbal elements arealways evoked discourse ntities or are inferrablefrom entities already evoked in the previous dis-course, and thus, help to ground the sentence inthe current context.I define topic and focus according to their infor-mational status.
A sentence can be divided into atopic and a comment, where the topic is the mainelement hat the sentence is about, and the com-ment is the main information we want to conveyabout this topic.
Assuming the heater's discoursemodel or knowledge store is organized by topics,the sentence topic can be seen as specifying an"address" in the heater's knowledge store (Rein-hart, 1982; Vallduvi, 1990).
The informationalfocus is the most information-bearing constituentin the sentence, (Vallduvi, 1990); it is the newor important information in the sentence (withinthe comment), and receives prosodic prominencein speech.
These information structure compo-nents are successful in describing the context-appropriate answer to database queries.
In thisdomain, the focus is the new or important part ofthe answer to a wh-question, while the topic is themain entity that the question and answer are bothabout, that can be paraphrased using the clause"As for X".
In other domains, finding the topicand focus of sentences according to the contextmay be more complicated.We can now explain why certain word ordersare appropriate or inappropriate in a certain con-text, in this case database queries.
For example, aspeaker may use the SOV order in (2b) to answerthe wh-question in (2a) because the speaker wantsto focus the new object, Ahmet, and so places itin the immediately preverbal position.
However,given a different wh-question in (3), the subject,(and their vowel-harmony variants) which attach tothe noun; nominative case and subject-verb agreementfor third person singular are unmarked.Fatma, is the focus of the answer, while Ahmet isthe topic, a link to the previous context, and thusthe OSV word order is used.

"Adjuncts can also occur in different sentencepositions in Turkish sentences depending on thecontext.
The different positions of the sententialadjunct "yesterday" in the following sentences re-sult in different discourse meanings, much as inEnglish.

"Clausal arguments, just like simple NP argu-ments, can occur anywhere in the matrix sentenceas long as they are case-marked, (5)a and b. Sub-ordinate verbs in Turkish resemble gerunds in En-glish; they take a genitive marked subject and arecase-marked like NPs, but they assign structuralcase to the rest of their arguments like verbs.
Thearguments and adjuncts within most embeddedclause can occur in any word order, also seen in(5)a and b.
In addition, elements from the embed-ded clause can occur in matrix clause positions,i.e.
long distance scrambling, (5c).
As indicatedby the translations, word order variation in com-plex sentences also affects the interpretation.

In addition,to capture the context-appropriate use of wordorder, the formalism must associate informationstructure components such as topic and focus withthe appropriate sentence positions, regardless ofthe predicate-argument structure of the sentence,and be able to handle the information structureof complex sentences.
In the next sections I willpresent a combinatory categorial formalism whichcan handle these characteristics of "free" word or-der languages.3 "Free" Word Order SyntaxIn Multiset-CCG 3, we capture the syntax of free.argument order within a clause by relaxing thesubcategorization requirements of a verb so thatit does not specify the linear order of its argu-ments.
Each verb is assigned a function categoryin the lexicon which subcategorizes for a multi-set of arguments, without linear order restrictions.For instance, a transitive verb has the categorySI{Nn , Wa},  a function looking for a set of ar-guments, a nominative case noun phrase (Nn) andan accusative case noun phrase (Na), and result-ing in the category S, a complete sentence, onceit has found these arguments in any order.The syntactic ategory for verbs provides no hi-erarchical or precedence information.
However, itis associated with a propositional interpretationthat does express the hierarchical ranking of thearguments.
For example, the verb "see" is as-signed the lexical category S :  see(X, Y ) \ ]{Nn:X, Na  : Y},  and the noun "Fatma" is assignedNn : Farina, where the semantic interpretationis separated from the syntactic representation bya colon.
These categories are a shorthand for themany syntactic and semantic features associatedwith each lexical item.
The verbal functions canalso specify a direction feature for each of their ar-guments, notated in the rules as an arrow abovethe argument.
Thus, verb-final anguages uch asKorean can be modeled by using this directionfeature in verbal categories, e.g.
S\]{ffn, ffa).Multiset-CCG contains a small set of rules thatcombine these categories into larger constituents.The following application rules allow a function3A preliminary version of the syntactic omponentof the grammar was presented in (Hoffman, 1992).such as a verbal category to' combine with one ofits arguments to its right (>) or left (<).
Weassume that a category X I0 where there are noarguments left in the multiset rewrites by a clean-up rule to just X.
(6) a.
Forward  App l i ca t ion  (>):Xl(ArgsUW}) Y ~ XlArgsb.
Backward  App l i ca t ion  (<):Y Xl(Args U {\]~}) =~ X\[ArgsUsing these application rules, a verb can ap-ply to its arguments in any order.
For exam-ple, the following is a derivation of a transi-tive sentence with the word order Object-Subject-Verb; variables in the semantic interpretations areitalicized .4(7)Ahmet' i  Fatma g6rdfi.Ahmet-Acc Fatma saw.Na:Ahmet Nn:Fatma S: see(X,Y)I{Nn:X, Na:Y )<S:see(Fatma, Y)\[ {Na: Y}<S: see(Fatma, Ahmet)In fact, all six permutations of this sentence canbe derived by the Multiset-CCG rules, and allare assigned the same propositional interpreta-tion, see(Fatma, Ahmet).The following composition rules combine twofunctions-with set-valued arguments, e.g.
twoverbal categories, a verbal category and an ad-junct.
(8) a.
Forward Composition (> B):X I (Argsx U {Y}) Y\] Argsy ==~ X I (ArgsxU Argsy)b. Backward Composition (< B):rl Argsy X I (Argsx U {Y}) ==~ X I (ArgsxU Argsy)c. Restriction: Y ~ NP.Through the use of the composition rules,Multiset-CCGs can handle the free word orderof sentential adjuncts.
Adjuncts are assigned afunction category SI{S } that can combine withany function that will also result in S, a completesentence.
The same composition rules allow twoverbs to compose together to handle complex sen-tences with embedded clauses.
This will be dis-cussed further in section 5.The restriction Y ~ NP on the Multiset-CCG composition rules prevents the categories forverbs, SI{NP}, and for adjectives, NP\]{\]~P),from combining together before combining witha bare noun.
This captures the fact that simpleNPs must be continuous and head-final in Turk-ish.
Multiset CCG is flexible enough to handle4In my implementation of this grammar, DAG-unificatiomis used in the rules.
To improve the effi-ciency of unification and parsing, the arguments of thecategories represented as DAGS are associated withfeature labels that indicate their category and case.247"free" word order languages that are freer thanTurkish, such as Warlpiri, through the use of un-restricted composition rules, but it can also han-dle languages more restrictive in word order suchsuch as Korean by restricting the categories thatcan take part in the composition rules.4 The Discourse Meaning of"Free" Word OrderWord order variation in Turkish and other "free"word order languages i  used to express the infor-mation structure of a sentence.
The grammar pre-sented in the last section determines the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, regardless ofword order.
In this section, I add the orderingcomponent of the grammar where the informa-tion structure of a sentence is determined.
Thesimple compositional interface described below al-lows the AS and the IS of a sentence to be derivedin parallel.
This interface is very similar to Steed-man's approach in integrating prosody and syntaxin CCGs for English (Steedman, 1991).A.
Each Multiset-CCG category encoding syn-tactic and semantic properties in the AS isassociated with an Ordering Category whichencodes the ordering of IS components.B.
Two constituents can combine if and only ifi.
their syntactic/semantic categories cancombine using the Multiset-CCG appli-cation and composition rules,ii.
and their Ordering Categories can com-bine using the rules below:S imple  Forward  App l i ca t ion  (>):X/Y  Y :::> X.S imple  Backward  App l i ca t ion  (<)"Y x \Y  ~x .I dent i ty  (=):  X X ~ XEvery verbal category in Multiset-CCG is asso-ciated with an ordering category, which serves asa template for the IS.
The ordering category in (9)is a function that specifies the components whichmust be found to complete a possible IS.
The for-ward and backward slashes in the category indi-cate the direction in which the arguments must befound, and the parentheses around arguments in-dicate optionality.
The variables T, F, G1, G2 willbe unified with the interpretations of the properconstituents in the sentence during the deriva-tion.
(9)I/(Ground: G2)\Topic: T \  (Ground: G1)\ Focus: Fwhere I =Topic: T \]Comment : \[ Focus : F \]\[ Ground:  \[verb,Cl, C$1,The function above can use the simple applicationrules to first combine with a focused constituenton its left, then a ground constituent on its left,then a topic constituent on its left, and a groundconstituent on its right.
This function will resultin a complete IS only if it finds the obligatorysentence-initial topic and the immediately prever-bal focus constituent; its other arguments (theground) are optional and can be skipped duringthe derivation through a category rewriting rule,XI(Y ) :::> X, that may apply after the applica-tion rules.
5Nonverbal elements are associated with simplerordering categories, often just a variable whichcan unify with the topic, focus, or any other com-ponent in the IS template during the derivation.The identity rule allows two constituents with thesame discourse function (often variables) to com-bine.
These simpler ordering categories also con-tain a feature which indicates whether they rep-resent given or new information in the discoursemodel, which is dynamically checked during thederivation.
Restrictions (such that elements to theright of the verb have to be discourse-old informa-tion in Turkish) are expressed as features on thearguments of the verbal ordering functions.What is novel about this formalism is that thepredicate-argument structure and the informationstructure of a sentence are built in parallel in acompositional way.
For example, given the fol-lowing question, we may answer in a word orderwhich indicates that "today" is the topic of thesentence, and "Little Ahmet" is the focus.
Thederivation for this answer is seen in Figure 1.
(10) a. Bugiin kimi gSrecek Fatma?Today who-Acc see-Fut Fatma?
"As for today, who will Fatma see?
"b.Bugiin kii~iik Ahmet'i g6recek Fatma.Today little Ahmet-Acc see-Fut Fatma.
"Today, she, Fatma, will see Little AHMET.
"In Figure 1, every word in the sentence is associ-ated with a lexical category right below it, which isthen assoc{ated with an ordering category in thenext line.
Parallel lines indicate the applicationof rules to combine two constituents ogether; thefirst line is for combining the syntactic ategories,and the second line is foe combining the orderingcategories of the two constituents.
The syntac-tic constituents are allowed to combine to form alarger constituent, only if their pragmatic oun-terparts (the ordering categories) can also com-bine.
Thus, the derivation reflects the single sur-face structure for the sentence, while composition-ally building the AS and the IS of the sentence in5Another IS is available where the topic componentis marked as "inferrable', for those cases where thetopic is a zero pronoun instead of an element which isrealized in the sentence.
After the derivation is com-plete, further discourse processing infers the identityof the unrealized topic from among the salient entitiesin the discourse model.248(11)BugiinTodayKii~iik Ahmet'i gSrd/ilittle Ahmet-Acc sawS:today(P)l{S:P } Nx:little(Z)/Nx:Z Na:AhmetX:today Y:little Z:Ahmet.>BAS = Na:little(Ahmet)IS = Y: \[little,Ahmet\]S: see(X, Y)I{Nn:X, Na:Y}I / (Grnd2) \Top\ (Grnd l ) \Foc<<,skipAS = S:see(X, little(Ahmet)) \] { Nn:X)IS = \[Focus:\[little,Ahmet\],Ground:see\]/(Grnd2)\ Top> BAS = S: today(see(X,little(Ahmet))) \] { Nn:X}IS ---- \[Topic: today, Focus:\[little,Ahmet\], Ground:see\]/(Grnd2)Fatma.Fatma.Nn:FatmaWgiv~n:+ Fatma-->AS = S: today(see(Fatma, little(Ahmet)))IS = \[Topic: today, Focus: \[little,Ahmet\], Ground: \[see,Fatma\]\]Figure 1: Deriving the Predicate-Argument and Information Structure for a Simple Sentence.parallel.Using this formalism, I have implementeda database query system (Hoffman, !994)which generates Turkish sentences with context-appropriate word orders, in answer to databasequeries.
In generation, the same topic foundin the database query is maintained in the an-swer.
For wh-questions, the information that isretrieved from the database to answer the ques-tion becomes the focus of the answer.
I have ex-tended the system to also handle yes-no questionsinvolving the question morpheme "mi", which isplaced next to whatever element is being ques-tioned in the sentence.
If the verb is being ques-tioned, this is a cue that the assertion or nega-tion of the verb will be the focus of the answer:(12) a. Ahmet'i Fatma gSrdii mii?Ahmet-Acc Fatma see-Past Quest.
"As for Ahmet; did Fatma SEE him?"b.
Haylr, Ahmet'iT Fatma \[GC)Rmedi\]r.No, Ahmet-Acc Farina see-Neg-Past.
"No, (as for Ahmet) Farina did NOT see him.
"In most Turkish sentences, the immediately pre-verbal position is prosodically prominent, and thiscorresponds with the informational focus.
How-ever, verbs can be focused in Turkish by placingthe primary stress of the sentence on the verb in-stead of immediately preverbal position and bylexical cues such as the placement of the questionmorpheme.
Thus, we must have more than oneIS available for verbs, where verbs can be in thefocus or the ground component of the IS.
In ad-dition, it is possible to focus the whole VP or thewhole sentence, which can be determined by thecontext, in this case the database query:(13) a. Bugiin Fatma ne yapacak?Today Fatma what do-Fut?
"What's Fatma going to do today?
"b.Bug/in Fatma \[kitap okuyacak\]r.Today Fatma book read-fut.
"Today, Fatma is going to \[read a BOOKIEIn yes/no questions, if a non-verbal element isbeing focused by the question morpheme and theanswer is no, the system provides a more natu-ral and helpful answer by replacing the focus ofthe question with a variable and searching thedatabase for an alternate ntity that satisfies therest of the question.Thus, Multiset CCG allows certain pragmaticdistinctions to influence the syntactic onstructionof the sentence using a lexicalized compositionalmethod.
In addition, it provides a uniform ap-proach to handle word order variation among ar-guments and adjuncts, and as we will see in thenext section, across clause boundaries.5 Complex Sentences5.1  Embedded In format ion  St ructuresAs in matrix clauses, arguments and adjunctsin embedded clauses can occur in any order.To capture the interpretation of the word orderwithin embedded clauses, my formalism allows forembedded information structures.
Subordinate249verbs, just like matrix verbs, are associated withan ordering category which determines the infor-mation structure for the clause.
When the sub-ordinate clause syntactically combines with thematrix clause, the IS of the subordinate clauseis embedded into the IS of the matrix clause.
Forexample, in the complex sentence and its IS be-low, the embedded clause is the topic of the matrixclause since it occurs in the sentence-initial posi-tion of the matrix clause.
The word order vari-ation within the embedded clause indicates thestructure of the IS that is embedded under topic.
(14) a.
\[D/in Fatma'nin gitti~ini\] Ay~e biliyor.Multiset-CCG can recover the appropriatepredicate-argument relations of the embeddedclause and the matrix clause even when the ar-guments occur out of the domain of the subordi-nate verb.
The composition rules allow two verbcategories with multisets of arguments o combinetogether.
As the two verbs combine, their argu-ments collapse into one argument set in the syn-tactic representation.
As seen in the derivationbelow, we compose the verbs together to form acomplex verbM function, which can then apply tothe arguments of both verbs in any order.(16)\[Yest.
Fatma-Gen go-Ger-Acc\] Ay~e knows, gitti~ini _"It's AY~E who knows that yesterday, FATMA left."
go-gerund-acc\[Topic : yesterdayTopic : !
Comment : \[Focus : Fatma \[ \[ Ground : go\ [Comment  : \[Focus : Ay~e 1\[ Ground : knowJTo ensure that the embedded.IS is complete be-fore it is placed into the matrix clause's IS, we re-strict the application rules (e.g.
X/Y  Y => X)in the ordering component of Multiset-CCG; westipulate that the argument Y must not be a func-tion (with arguments left to find).
The restrictionensures that the ordering category for the embed-ded verb is no longer a function, that it has foundall o f  its obligatory components and skipped allthe optional ones before combining with the ma-trix verb's ordering category.5.2 Long Distance ScramblingIn Turkish complex sentences with clausal ar-guments, elements of the embedded clauses canoccur in matrix clause positions, i.e.
long dis-tance scrambling.
However, speakers only uselong distance scrambling for specific pragmaticfunctions.
Generally, an element from the em-bedded clause can occur in the sentence initialtopic position of the matrix clause (e.g.
(15)b) orto the right of the matrix verb as backgroundedinformation (e.g.
(15)d), but cannot occur inthe stressed immediately preverbal position (e.g.(15)c).
This long distance dependency is sim-ilar to the English topicalization construction.

The propositional interpretation of thesubordinate clause is embedded into the interpre-tation of the matrix clause.The syntactic component of Multiset-CCGscorrectly rules out long distance scrambling to theimmediately preverbal matrix position, becauseelements from the embedded clause cannot com-bine with the matrix verb before the matrix verbhas combined with the embedded verb.
(17)*\[Gitti~ini\] Ay~e Fatma'nin biliyor.
*\[Go-Ger-Acc\] Ay~e Fatma-Gen know-Pres.SN~I{Ng,Na } Nn Ng SI{Nn, SN~}XXX-Long distance scrambling to the sentence initialposition and post-verbal position in the matrixclause is handled through the composition of theverbs, as seen in Figure 2.The ordering component of Multiset CCG al-lows individual elements from subordinate clausesto be components in the IS of the matrix clause.This is because the ordering category for a ma-trix verb does not specify that its components bearguments in its AS.
In the sentence in Figure 2,"Fatma", an argument of the embedded clause,has been scrambled into the topic position of thematrix clause.
The derivation with both compo-nents of the grammar working in parallel is shownin Figure 2.
The embedded verb must first com-plete its IS (IS2); then, the two verbs compose to-gether, and the subordinate IS is embedded intothe matrix IS (/SI).
The complex verbal con-stituent can then combine with the rest of thearguments of both verbs in any order.
The lin-ear order of the two NP arguments will determinewhich components of the matrix IS each fill.
Notethat "Fatma" is an argument in the interpretationof the embedded verb "go", not the matrix verb"know", but it plays the role of topic in the matrix250Fatma'nin Ay~eFatma-Gen Ay~e\[d/in gitti~ini\]\[yesterday go-Ger-Acc\]biliyor.know-Pres.Ng:Fatma Nn:Ay?eX:Fatma Y:Ay~eIS\]S:yest(P)I{S:P} SNa: go(X) I{ Ng:X }W:yesterday IS2/(Grnd2)\(Top)\(Grndl)\Foc>B<,skip3AS = SNa: yesterday(go(X)) \[ { ig :X}IS2 = \[Topic:inferrable, Focus:yesterday, Ground:go\]S: know(Y,Z) I { Nn:r ,  SNa : Z}IS1/(Grnd2)\Top\(Grndl )\Foc<B< IT?pie\[ \[ Topic : inferrableFocus : IS2 Comment : Focus : yest.l Comment : Ground : go\[ Ground : know, Grndl, Grnd2\]AS = S: know(Y, yesterday(go(X))) I { Nn:Y, Ng:X}Top/(Gtnd2)\Top\(Grndl)<<AS = S: know(Ay~e,yesterday(go(X))) I{ Ng:X}IS = IS1/(Grnd2)\Top<<IS =AS = S: know(Ay~e,yesterday(go(Fatma)))I Topic :Comment :FatmaFocus  :Ground :Topic :Comment :\[Ay~e, know \]inferrable J \]\[ Focus : yesterday \]\[ Ground : goFigure 2: Derivation for the AS and IS of a Complex Sentence.verb's IS.
Thus, adjuncts and elements from em-bedded clauses can play a role in the informationstructure of the matrix clause, although they donot belong to the same predicate-argument struc-ture.5.3 Is landsThe syntactic component of Multiset-CCGs canderive a string of any number of scram-bled NPs followed by a string of verbs:(NP1 ...NPm)scrambled Vm ... Vl, where each verb,V/, subcategorizes for NPi.
The more one scram-bles things, the harder the sentence is to process,but there is no clear cut-off point in which thescrambled sentences become ungrammatical fornative speakers.
Thus, I claim that processinglimitations and pragmatic purposes, rather thansyntactic ompetence, restrict such scrambling.However, in some "free" word order languages,some clauses act as islands that strictly do not al-low long distance scrambling.
However, in someother "free" word order languages, uch as Turk-ish, it is very hard to find island effects.
As seenin the first example in Figure 3, even elementsfrom relative clauses can be extracted.
However,it is harder to extract elements from some adjunctclauses which do not have close semantic links tothe matrix clause.
To account for clauses exhibit-ing island behaviour, we can assign the head ofthe clause a category such as SISI{Nn , Na} whichmakes certain that the head combines with all ofits NP arguments before combining with the ma-trix clause, S. As demonstrated in (19)c in Fig-ure 3, long distance scrambling out of such an ad-junct clause is thus prohibited.In contrast, heads of adjunct clauses whichare not islands are assigned categories uch asSI{S , Nn, Na}.
Since this category can combinewith the matrix verb even before it has combinedwith all of its arguments, it allows long distancescrambling of its arguments.
This lexical controlof the behaviour is very advantageous for captur-ing Turkish, since not every adjunct clause is anisland in Turkish.
However, further research is251(18) Ankara'dani sen \[ei diin gelen\] adam1 tamyor musun?Ankara-Abli you \[ei yest.

Thesyntactic omponent of Multiset CCG is flexibleenough to derive the predicate-argument structureof simple and complex sentences without relyingon word order, and it is expressive nough to cap-ture syntactic restrictions on word order in dif-ferent languages uch as languages with NP orclausal islands or languages which allow discon-tinuous NPs or clauses.
Word order is used inthe ordering component of Multiset CCG to de-termine the information structure of a sentence.Every Multiset CCG category encoding syntac-tic and semantic properties i  associated with anordering category which encodes the ordering ofinformation structure components such as topicand focus; two syntactic/semantic categories areallowed to combine to form a larger constituentonly if their ordering categories can also combine.The formalism has been implemented within adatabase query task in Quintus Prolog, to inter-pret and generate simple and complex sentenceswith context-appropriate word orders.Multiset CCG captures the context-appropriateuse of word order by compositionally deriving thepredicate-argument structure and the informationstructure of a sentence in parallel.
It allows ad-juncts and elements from embedded clauses totake part in the information structure of the ma-trix clause, even though they do not take part inits predicate-argument structure.
Thus, this for-malism provides a uniform approach in capturingthe syntactic and pragmatic aspects of word or-der variation among arguments and adjuncts, andacross clause boundaries.ReferencesElisabet Engdahl and Enric Vallduvi.
