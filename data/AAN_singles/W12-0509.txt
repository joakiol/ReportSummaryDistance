A qualitative assessment of the conversion between the two annotation schemes was performed toverify the applicability of the new ISO standard using authentic transcribed speech.
The results show that in addition to a major part ofthe SWBD-DAMSL tag set that can be converted to the ISO DA scheme automatically, some problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags stillneed to be handled manually.
We shall report the evaluation of such an application based on the preliminary results from automaticmapping via machine learning techniques.

IntroductionThis article describes the collaborative work on applyingthe newly proposed ISO standard for dialogue actannotation to the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA)Corpus, as part of our on-going effort to promoteinteroperability of standardized linguistic annotationswith the ultimate goal of developing shared and openlanguage resources.Dialogue acts (DA) play a key role in theinterpretation of the communicative behaviour ofdialogue participants and offer valuable insight into thedesign of human-machine dialogue systems (Bunt et al,2010).
More recently, the emerging ISO DIS 24617-2(2010) standard for dialogue act annotation definesdialogue acts as the ?communicative activity of aparticipant in dialogue interpreted as having a certaincommunicative function and semantic content, andpossibly also having certain functional dependencerelations, rhetorical relations and feedback dependencerelations?
(p. 3).
The semantic content specifies theobjects, relations, events, etc.
that the dialogue act isabout; the communicative function can be viewed as aspecification of the way an addressee uses the semanticcontent to update his or her information state when he orshe understands the corresponding stretch of dialogue.Continuing efforts have been made to identify andclassify the dialogue acts expressed in dialogue utterancestaking into account the empirically provenmultifunctionality of utterances, i.e., the fact thatutterances often express more than one dialogue act (seeBunt, 2009 and 2011).
In other words, an utterance indialogue typically serves several functions.
See Example(1) taken from the SWBD-DA Corpus(sw_0097_3798.utt).
(1) A: Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh,funding for AIDS research?
Do you?B:   Well, uh, uh, that?s something I?ve thought a lotabout.With the first utterance, Speaker A performs twodialogue acts: he (a) assigns the next turn to theparticipant Michael, and (b) formulates an open question.Speaker B, in his response, (a) accepts the turn, (b) stallsfor time, and (c) answers the question by making astatement.Our concern in this paper is to explore theapplicability of the new ISO Standard to the existingSwitchboard corpus with joint efforts of automatic andmanual mapping.
In the rest of the paper, we shall firstdescribe the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA)Corpus and its annotation scheme (i.e.
SWBD-DAMSL).We shall then describe the new ISO Standard and explainour mapping of SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO DIS 24617-2DA tag set.
In addition, machine learning techniques areemployed for automatic DA classification on the basis oflexical features to evaluate the application of the new ISODA scheme using authentic transcribed speech.
We shallthen introduce the user interface designed for manualmapping and explain the annotation guidelines.
Finally,the paper will conclude with discussions and suggestionsfor future work.2.
Corpus ResourceThis study uses the Switchboard Dialog Act (SWBD-DA)Corpus as the corpus resource, which is available onlinefrom the Linguistic Data Consortium 1 .
The corpus1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/61contains 1,155 5-minute conversations2, orthographicallytranscribed in about 1.5 million word tokens.
It should benoted that the minimal unit of utterances for DAannotation in the SWBD Corpus is the so called ?slashunit?
(Meteer and Taylor, 1995), defined as ?maximally asentence but can be smaller unit?
(p. 16), and ?slash-unitsbelow the sentence level correspond to those parts of thenarrative which are not sentential but which the annotatorinterprets as complete?
(p. 16).
See Table 1 for the basicstatistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus.Table 1: Basic Statistics of the SWBD-DA CorpusAltogether, the corpus comprises 223,606 slash-units andeach is annotated for its communicative functionaccording to a set of dialogue acts specified in theSWBD-DAMSL scheme (Jurafsky et al, 1997) andassigned a DA tag.
See Example (2) taken fromsw_0002_4330.utt, where qy is the DA tag for yes/noquestions.
(2) qy   A.1 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } does the companyyou work for test for drugs?
/A total of 303 different DA tags are identified throughoutthe corpus, which is different from the total number of220 tags mentioned in Jurafsky et al (1997: 3).
To ensureenough instances for the different DA tags, we alsoconflated the DA tags together with their secondarycarat-dimensions, and yet we did not use the seven specialgroupings by Jurafsky et al (1997) as we kept them asseparate DA types (see Section 4 for further explanations).In the end, the 303 tags were clustered into 60 differentindividual communicative functions.
See Table 2 for thebasic statistics of the 60 DA clusters.According to Table 2, we observe that the 60 DAclusters range from 780,570 word tokens for thetop-ranking statement-non-opinion to only 4 word2 Past studies (e.g.
Stolcke et al, 2000; Jurafsky et al,1997; Jurafsky et al, 1998a; Jurafsky et al, 1998b) havebeen focused on only 1115 conversations in theSWBD-DA Corpus as the training set.
As there is no cleardescription which 40 conversations have been used as thetesting set or for future use, we use all the 1155conversations.tokens for you?re-welcome.
In Table 2, the Token %column lists the relative importance of DA typesmeasured as the proportion of the word tokens in theSWBD-DA corpus as whole.
It can be observed that, asyet another example to illustrate the uneven use of DAtypes, statement-opinion accounts for 21.04% of thetotal number of word tokens in the corpus.60 DAs Tokens Token % Cum %Statement-non-opinion 780,570 51.79 51.79Statement-opinion 317,021 21.04 72.83Segment-(multi-utterance) 135,632 9.00 81.83Acknowledge-(backchannel) 40,696 2.70 84.53Abandoned 35,214 2.34 86.87Yes-no-question 34,817 2.31 89.18Accept 20,670 1.37 90.55Statement-expanding-y/n-answer 14,479 0.96 91.51Wh-question 14,207 0.94 92.45Appreciation 13,957 0.93 93.38Declarative-yes-no-question 10,062 0.67 94.05Conventional-closing 9,017 0.60 94.65Quoted-material 7,591 0.50 95.15Summarize/reformulate 6,750 0.45 95.60Action-directive 5,860 0.39 95.99Rhetorical-questions 5,759 0.38 96.37Hedge 5,636 0.37 96.74Open-question 4,884 0.32 97.06Affirmative-non-yes-answers 4,199 0.28 97.34Uninterpretable 4,138 0.27 97.61Yes-answers 3,512 0.23 97.84Completion 2,906 0.19 98.03Hold-before-answer/agreement 2,860 0.19 98.22Or-question 2,589 0.17 98.39Backchannel-in-question-form 2,384 0.16 98.55Acknowledge-answer 2,038 0.14 98.69Negative-non-no-answers 1,828 0.12 98.81Other-answers 1,727 0.11 98.92No-answers 1,632 0.11 99.03Or-clause 1,623 0.11 99.14Other 1,578 0.10 99.24Dispreferred-answers 1,531 0.10 99.34Repeat-phrase 1,410 0.09 99.43Reject 891 0.06 99.49Transcription-errors:-slash-units 873 0.06 99.55Declarative-wh-question 855 0.06 99.61Signal-non-understanding 770 0.05 99.66Self-talk 605 0.04 99.70Offer 522 0.03 99.73Conventional-opening 521 0.03 99.763rd-party-talk 458 0.03 99.79Accept-part 399 0.03 99.82Downplayer 341 0.02 99.84Apology 316 0.02 99.86Exclamation 274 0.02 99.88Commit 267 0.02 99.90Thanking 213 0.01 99.91Double-quote 183 0.01 99.92Reject-part 164 0.01 99.93Tag-question 143 0.01 99.94Maybe 140 0.01 99.95Sympathy 80 0.01 99.96Explicit-performative 78 0.01 99.97Open-option 76 0.01 99.98Other-forward-function 42 0.00 99.98Correct-misspeaking 37 0.00 99.98No-plus-expansion 26 0.00 99.98Yes-plus-expansion 22 0.00 99.98You?re-welcome 4 0.00 99.98Double-labels 2 0.00 100.00Total 1,507,079 100.00 100.00Table 2: Basic Statistics of the 60 DAsIf the cumulative proportion (Cum%) is considered, weFolder# ofConversations# ofSlash-units# ofTokenssw00  99 14,277 103,045sw01 100 17,430 119,864sw02 100 20,032 132,889sw03 100 18,514 127,050sw04 100 19,592 132,553sw05 100 20,056 131,783sw06 100 19,696 135,588sw07 100 20,345 136,630sw08 100 19,970 134,802sw09 100 20,159 133,676sw10 100 22,230 143,205sw11  16   3,213   20,493sw12  11   2,773   18,164sw13  29   5,319   37,337Total      1,155   223,606 1,507,07962see that the top 10 DA types alone account for 93.38% ofthe whole corpus, suggesting again the uneven occurrenceof DA types in the corpus and hence the disproportionaluse of communication functions in conversationaldiscourse.It is particularly worth mentioning thatsegment-(multi-utterance) is not really a DA typeindicating communicative function and yet it is the thirdmost frequent DA tag in SWBD-DAMSL.
As a matter offact, the SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme containsquite a number of such non-communicative DA tags, suchas abandoned, and quoted-material.3.
ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010)A basic premise of the emerging ISO standard fordialogue act annotation, i.e., ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010), isthat utterances in dialogue are often multifunctional;hence the standard supports so-called ?multidimensionaltagging?, i.e., the tagging of utterances with multiple DAtags.
It does so in two ways: First of all, it defines ninedimensions to which a dialogue act can belong:?
Task?
Auto-Feedback?
Allo-Feedback?
Turn Management?
Time Management?
Discourse Structuring?
Social Obligations Management?
Own Communication Management?
Partner Communication ManagementSecondly, it takes a so-called ?functional segment?
asthe unit in dialogue to be tagged with DA information,defined as a ?minimal stretch of communicative behaviorthat has one or more communicative functions?
(Bunt etal., 2010).
A functional segment is allowed to bediscontinuous, and to overlap with or be included inanother functional segment.
A functional segment may betagged with at most one DA tag for each dimension.Another important feature is that an ISO DA tagconsists not only of a communicative function encoding,but also of a dimension indication, with optional attributesfor representing certainty, conditionality, sentiment, andlinks to other dialogue units expressing semantic,rhetorical and feedback relations.Thus, two broad differences can be observed betweenSWBD-DAMSL and ISO.
The first concerns thetreatment of the basic unit of analysis.
While inSWBD-DAMSL this is the slash-unit, ISO DIS 24617-2(2010) employs the functional segment, which serves wellto emphasise the multifunctionality of dialogue utterances.An important difference here is that the ISO schemeidentifies multiple DAs per segment and assigns multipletags via the stand-off annotation mechanism.The second difference is that each slash-unit (orutterance) in the SWBD-DA Corpus is annotated with oneSWBD-DAMSL label, while each DA tag in the ISOscheme is additionally associated with a dimension tagand, when appropriate, with function qualifiers andrelations to other dialogue units.
See the followingexample taken from the Schiphol Corpus.
(3) A: I?m most grateful for your helpWhile the utterance in Example (3) would be annotatedwith only a functional tag in SWBD-DAMSL, it isannotated to contain the communicative function ?inform?and in addition the dimension of social obligationmanagement:communicativeFunction = ?inform?dimension = ?socialObligationManagement?4.
Mapping SWBD-DAMSL to ISO4.1 Data Pre-processingFor the benefit of the current study and potentialfollow-up work, the banners between folders wereremoved and each slash-unit was extracted to create a setof files.
See Example (4), the tenth slash-unit taken fromthe file sw_0052_4378.utt in the folder sw00.
(4) sd     B.7 utt1: {C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we?vedone <sigh> lots to it.
/The following set of files is created:sw00-0052-0010-B007-01.txt  the original utterancesw00-0052-0010-B007-01-S.da  SWBD-DAMSL tagIn the .txt file, there is the original utterance:{C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we?vedone <sigh> lots to it.
/While the *-S.da file only contains the DA label: sd^t.Still another one or more files (depending on the numberof dimensions) will be added to this set after convertingthe SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO tag sets.
Take Example (4)for instance.
Two more files will be created, namely,sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-0.da  ISO DA tagsw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-1.da  ISO DA tagThe *-ISO-0.da file will contain in this case:communicativeFunction = ?inform?dimension = ?task?3and the *-ISO-1.da file will contain4:communicativeFunction = ?stalling?dimension = ?timeManagement?3 The same function Inform have been observed to occurin different dimensions.
See ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) fordetailed description.4 See Section 4.2 for more explanation of the multi-layerannotations in ISO standard.634.2 Assessment of the ConversionWhen mapping SWBD-DAMSL tags to functional ISOtags, it is achieved in terms of semantic contents ratherthan the surface labels.
To be more exact, four situationswere identified in the matching process.The first is what is named as ?exact matches?.
It isworth mentioning that since we are not matching thelabels in the two annotation schemes, even for the exactmatches, the naming in SWBD-DAMSL is not always thesame as that in the ISO scheme, but they have the same orvery similar meaning.
Table 3 lists the exact matches.SWBD-DAMSL ISOOpen-question QuestionDispreferred answers DisconfirmOffer OfferCommit PromiseOpen-option SuggestHold before answer/ agreement StallingCompletion CompletionCorrect-misspeaking CorrectMisspeakingApology ApologyDownplayer AcceptApologyThanking ThankingYou?re-welcome AcceptThankingSignal-non-understanding AutoNegativeConventional-closing InitialGoodbyeTable 3: Exact MatchesIt can also be noted that in the previous study on the 42DA types in SWBD-DAMSL, open-option (oo),offer (co), commit (cc) are treated as one DA type.
Inthe current study, they are treated as individual DA types,which makes more sense especially when mapping to theISO DA tag sets since each of them corresponds to adifferent ISO tag, suggest, offer, and promiserespectively.
The same is also true for theyou?re-welcome (fw) and correct-misspeaking(bc), which are combined together in SWBD-DAMSLand correspond to different ISO DA label.SWBD-DAMSL ISOWh-question; Declarative wh-question SetQuestionOr-question; Or-clause ChoiceQuestionYes-no-question;Backchannel in question form PropositionalQuestionTag-question;Declarative Yes-no-question CheckQuestionStatement-non-opinion;Statement-opinion;Rhetorical-question;Statement expanding y/n answer; HedgeInformMaybe; Yes-answer;Affirmative non-yes answers;Yes plus expansion; No-answer;Negative non-no answers;No plus expansionAnswerAcknowledge (backchannel);Acknowledge answer; Appreciation;Sympathy; Summarize/reformulate;Repeat-phraseAutoPositiveAccept-part; Reject-part CorrectionTable 4: Many-to-one MatchesThe second situation is where more than oneSWBD-DAMSL tags can be matched to the one ISO DAtype, as defined as many-to-one matches.
Table 4 showsthe many-to-one matches.
Such matches occur becausesemantically identical functions are sometimes givendifferent names in SWBD-DAMSL in order to distinguishdifferences in lexical or syntactic form.
For example, anaffirmative non-yes answer is defined as anaffirmative answer that does not contain the word yes orone of its variants (like yeah and yep).The most complex issue is with the one-to-manymatches, where a DA function in SWBD-DAMSL is toogeneral and corresponds to a set of different DAs in theISO scheme.
Consider the DA type of accept inSWBD-DAMSL.
It is a broad function applicable to arange of different situations.
For instance, acceptannotated as aa in Example (5) taken fromsw_0005_4646.utt corresponds to Agreement in ISODIS 24617-2 (2010).
(5) sd    A.25 utt1: {C Or } people send you there as alast resort.
/aa     B.26 utt1: Right,  /However, accept (aa) in Example (6) taken fromsw_0098_3830.utt actually corresponds toacceptOffer in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).
(6) co    B.26 utt1: I can tell you my last job or --/aa    A.27 utt1: Okay,  /As a matter of fact, accept in SWBD-DAMSL maycorrespond to several different DAs in the ISO tag setsuch as:?
Agreement?
AcceptRequest (addressRequest)?
AccpetSuggestion (addressSuggestion)?
AcceptOffer (addressOffer)?
etc.Other cases include reject, action-directive andother answers.Finally, the remaining tags are unique toSWBD-DAMSL, including?
quoted material?
uninterpretable?
abandoned?
self-talk?
3rd-party-talk?
double labels?
explicit-performative?
exclamation?
other-forward-functionIt is not difficult to notice that 6 out of the 9 DA typesmainly concern the marking up of other phenomena thandialogue acts.
The last three unique DA types onlyaccount for a marginal portion of the whole set, about0.03% all together (See Table 2).64In addition, multi-layer annotations of ISO can beadded to the original markup of SWBD (Meteer andTaylor 1995), especially in cases such as Stalling andSelf-Correction.
See Example (7) taken fromsw_0052_4378.utt.
(7) sd   A.12  utt2 : [ I, + {F uh, } two months ago I ]went to Massachusetts -- /According to Meteer and Taylor (1995), the {F ?}
isused to mark up ?filler?
in utterances, which correspondsto Stalling in ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010).
In addition, themarkup of [ ?
+ ?]
indicates the repairs (Meteer andTaylor, 1995), which suits well the definition ofSelf-correction in the ISO standard.
As a result, theutterance in Example (7) is thus annotated in threedimensions:communicativeFunction = ?inform?dimension = ?task?communicativeFunction = ?stalling?dimension = ?timeManagement?communicativeFunction = ?self-correction?dimension = ?ownCommManagement?4.3 Mapping PrinciplesGiven the four setting of the matching, there majorprinciples were made:1) Cases in both ?exact matches?
and ?many-to-onematches?
can be automatically mapped to ISO tags byprogramming.2) Tags that are unique to SWBD-DAMSL would notbe considered at the current stage due to the absence ofISO counterparts and their marginal proportion.3) Cases in ?one-to-many matches?
are more complexand call for manual mapping, which will be furtherdiscussed in Section 6.4) Different DA dimensions will be also automaticallyadded accordingly to each utterance in the format ofstand-off annotation.5.
Application VerificationTo evaluate the applicability of mapping SWBD-DAMSLtag set to the new ISO standard (ISO DIS 24617-2, 2010),machine learning techniques are employed, based on thepreliminary results from the automatic mapping, to seehow well the SWBD-ISO DA tags can be automaticallyidentified and classified based on lexical features.
Theresult is also compared with that obtained from theTop-15 SWBD-DAMSL tags.
It will be particularlyinteresting to find out whether the emerging ISO DAannotation standard will produce better automaticprediction accuracy.
In this paper, we evaluate theperformance of automatic DA classification in the two DAannotation schemes by employing the unigrams as thefeature set.Two classification tasks were then identifiedaccording to the two DA annotation schemes.
Task 1 is toautomatically classify the DA types in theSWBD-DAMSL.
Based on the observations mentionedabove, it was decided to use the top 15 DA types toinvestigate the distribution of word types in order toascertain the lexical characteristics of DAs.
Furthermore,since segment-(multi-utterance), abandoned, andquoted-material do not relate to dialogue acts per se,these three were replaced with rhetorical-questions,open-question andaffirmative-non-yes-answers.
We thus deriveTable 6 below, showing that the revised list of top 15 DAtypes account for 85.13% of the SWBD corpus.
The DAtypes are arranged according to Token% in descendingorder.Top-15 SWBD-DAMSL DAs Tokens Token % Cum %Statement-non-opinion 780,570 51.79 51.79Statement-opinion 317,021 21.04 72.83Acknowledge-(backchannel) 40,696 2.70 75.53Yes-no-question 34,817 2.31 77.84Accept 20,670 1.37 79.21Statement-expanding-y/n-answer 14,479 0.96 80.17Wh-question 14,207 0.94 81.11Appreciation 13,957 0.93 82.04Declarative-yes-no-question 10,062 0.67 82.71Conventional-closing 9,017 0.60 83.31Summarize/reformulate 6,750 0.45 83.76Action-directive 5,860 0.39 84.15Rhetorical-questions 5,759 0.38 84.53Open-question 4,884 0.32 84.85Affirmative-non-yes-answers 4,199 0.28 85.13Total 1,282,948 85.13Table 6: Top-15 SWBD-DAMSL DA typesNext, accordingly, task 2 is to classify the top 15 ISODAs based on the results from the automatic mapping.

The DAInitialGoodbye has the highest precision, of about97%, whereas Inform has the highest recall of over 98%.Similar to the results obtained in Task 1, the last four typesof DAs in Task 2 also cannot be classified with theF-score of 0%.Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, when the data sizefor each DA type is taken into consideration, Task 2 maybe more challenging than Task 1 in that 6 out of the 15SWBD-ISO DA types has a total number of word tokensfewer than 4,000 whereas all the 15 SWBD-DAMSL DAtypes has a total number of over 4,000.
Therefore, themuch higher average F-score suggests that the applicationof ISO standard DA scheme could lead to betterclassification performance, suggesting that the ISO DAstandard represents a better option for automatic DAclassification.To sum up, with a comparable version of theSWBD-DA Corpus, results from the automatic DAclassification tasks show that the ISO DA annotationscheme produces better automatic prediction accuracy,which encourages the completion of the manual mapping.6.
Manual Mapping6.1 Analysis of Problematic DA TypesAs mentioned earlier, there are mainly four problematicSWBD-DAMSL tags, namely, accept (aa), reject(ar), action-directive (ad) and other answers(no).
They are problematic in that they carry a broadfunction applicable to a range of different situationsaccording to the new ISO standard, as evidenced in thecase of accept discussed in Section 4.2.
Consequently, tomap the problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags to the ISO tagscalls for manual manipulation.A close look into those four types shows that themapping could be further divided into two setting.
Again,take accept (aa) for example.
In the first setting, asub-division of accept (aa) can also be automaticallymatched according to the previous utterance by the otherspeaker in the adjacent pair.
See Example (8) taken fromsw_0001_4325.utt.
(8) sv     A.49 utt3: take a long time to find the rightplace /x      A.49 utt4: <laughter>.aa     B.50 utt1: Yeah,  /Here accept (aa) corresponds to Agreement because ofthe DA type in A.49 utt3 but not the immediate previousDA as in A.49 utt4.
With this principle, the particularsub-groups for automatic mapping were identified foraccept (aa).
See Table 10.SWBD-DAMSLISOPrevious DA Current DAStatement-non-opinion;Statement-opinion; HedgeRhetorical-question;Statement expanding y/n answer,acceptAgreementOffer AcceptOfferOpen-option AcceptRequestThanking AcceptThankingApology AcceptApologyTable 10: Sub-groups of accept for Auto MappingThe remaining cases, in the second setting, call formanual annotation.
For instance, when the previous DAtype is also a problematic one, annotators need to decide66the corresponding ISO DA tag for the previousSWBD-DAMSL one before converting the accept (aa).See Example (9) taken from sw_0423_3325.utt.
(9) ad    B.128 utt2: {C so } we'll just wait.
/aa    A.129 utt1: Okay,  /Here, action-directive (ad) is first decided as asuggestion, and therefore accept (aa) turns out toactually correspond to acceptSuggestion(addressSuggestion) in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).6.2 Design of a User InterfaceGiven the analysis of those four DA tags, a user-friendlyinterface was then designed to assist annotators tomaximize the inter-annotator agreement.
See Figure 1.Figure 1: User InterfaceFigure 1 shows the screenshot when the targetedSWBD-DAMSL type is accept (aa).
As can be notedabove, the basic functional bars have been designed,including:?
Input: the path of the input?
Automatch: to filter out the sub-groups that can beautomatically matched?
DA Tag: the targeted problematic DAs, namely,?
aa (accept)?
ar (reject)?
ad (action-directive) and?
no (other answers)?
Previous: to go back to the previous instance of thetargeted DA type?
Next: to move on to the next instance of the targetedDA type?
Current: the extraction of the adjacent turns?
Previous5T: the extraction of the previous five turnswhen necessary?
PreviousAll: the extraction of all the previous turnswhen necessary?
MatchInfo: Bars for mapping information with fiveoptions:?
Four pre-defined ISO DA types?
Other: a user-defined mapping with atwo-fold function: for user defined ISO DAtype and for extra pre-defined ISO DA types(since the pre-defined DA types differ forthe four targeted SWBD-DAMSL types).?
Output: the path of the output?
Result: export the results to the chosen pathWith this computer-aided interface, three annotators areinvited to carry out the manual mapping.
They are allpostgraduates with linguistic background.
After a monthof training on the understanding of the two annotationschemes (in process), they will work on theSWBD-DAMSL DA instances from 115 randomly chosenfiles, and map them into ISO DA tags independently.
Thekappa value will be calculated to measure theinter-annotator agreement.7.
ConclusionIn this paper, we reported our efforts in applying theISO-standardized dialogue act annotations to theSwitchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) Corpus.
Inparticular, the SWBD-DAMSL tags employed in theSWBD-DA Corpus were analyzed and mapped onto theISO DA tag set (ISO DIS 24617-2 2010) according totheir communicative functions and semantic contents.Such a conversion is a collaborative process involvingboth automatic mapping and manual manipulation.
Withthe results from the automatic mapping, machine learningtechniques were employed to evaluate the applicability ofthe new ISO standard for dialogue act annotation inpractice.
With the encouraging results from the evaluation,the manual mapping was carried out.
A user-friendlyinterface was designed to assist annotators.
Theimmediate future work would be finish the manualmapping and thus to  produce a comparable version of theSWBD-DA Corpus was produced so that the twoannotation schemes (i.e.
SWBD-DAMSL vs. SWBD-ISO)can be effectively compared on the basis of empirical data.Furthermore, with the newly built resource, i.e.,SWBD-ISO, we plan to examine the effect ofgrammatical and syntactic cues on the performance of DAclassification, with a specific view on whether dialogueacts exhibit differentiating preferences for grammaticaland syntactic constructions that have been overlookedbefore.8.
