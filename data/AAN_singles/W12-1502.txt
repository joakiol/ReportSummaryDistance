James LesterNorth Carolina State UniversityExpressive NLG for Next-Generation Learning Environments: Language, Affect, andNarrativeAbstractRecent years have seen the appearance of adaptive learning technologies that offer significant potentialfor bringing about fundamental improvements in education.
A promising development in this arena is theemergence of  narrative-centered learning environments,  which integrate  the inferential  capabilities ofintelligent  tutoring  systems  with  the  rich  gameplay  supported  by  commercial  game  engines.
Whilenarrative-centered learning environments have demonstrated effectiveness in both student learning andengagement,  their  capabilities  will  increase  dramatically  with  expressive  NLG.
In  this  talk  we  willintroduce the principles motivating the design of narrative-centered learning environments, discuss therole of NLG in narrative-centered learning, consider the interaction of NLG, affect, and learning, andexplore how next-generation learning environments will push the envelope in expressive NLG.BiographyDr.
