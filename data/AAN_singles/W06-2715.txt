Regarding theXML representation this approach is sim-ilar to standoff annotation.
A second topicis the use of heterogeneous linguistic re-sources (e.g., XML annotated documents,taggers, lexical nets) as a source for semi-automatic multi-dimensional markup toresolve typical linguistic issues, dealingwith anaphora resolution as a case study.11 Introduction ?
Why (and how) to useheterogeneous linguistic resourcesA large and diverse amount of linguistic resources(audio and video recodings, textual recordings)has been piled up during various projects all overthe world.
A reasonable subset of these resourcesconsists of machine-readable structured linguis-tic documents (often XML annotated), dictionar-ies, grammars or ontologies.
Sometimes theseare available to the public on the Web, cf.
Si-mons (2004).
The availability allows for the so-phisticated examination of linguistic questions andthe reuse of existing linguistic material.
Espe-cially corpora annotated for discourse-related phe-nomena have become an important source for var-ious linguistic studies.
Besides annotated corporaexternal knowledge bases like lexical nets (e.g.,WordNet, GermaNet) and grammars, can be usedto support several linguistic processes.Although XML has recently established itselfas the technology and format of choice the be-fore mentioned resources remain heterogeneous1The work presented in this paper is part of the project A2Sekimo of the Research Group Text-technological modellingof information funded by the German Research Foundation.in respect of the data format (i.e., the underlyingschema) or the functionality provided.
A simpleapproach to make use of different resources is touse them one by one, starting with raw text data (orannotated XML) as input and providing the outputof the first process (e.g., a tagger) as input for thenext step (e.g., a parser).
However, this methodmay lead to several problems.
One possible prob-lem of this method is that the output format of oneprocessing resource can be unemployable as inputformat for the next.
Another potential problem ofusing XML annotated documents is overlappingannotation.
And finally it is sometimes necessary(or desirable) to process only parts of the inputdocument.The structure of the paper is as follows: In Sec-tion 2 our approach of representing multiple anno-tations is desribed, in Section 3 the use of multi-root trees for the representation of heterogeneousressources is presented.
As a case study, the res-olution of anaphoric relations is described in Sec-tion 4.2 Multiple annotationsRepresenting data corresponding to different lev-els of annotation is a fundamental problem of text-technological research.
Renear et al (1996) dis-cuss the OHCO-Thesis2 as one of the basic as-sumptions about the structure of text and show thatthis assumption cannot be upheld consistently.
Be-ing based on the OHCO-Thesis most markup lan-guages (including SGML and XML) are designedin principle to represent one structure per docu-ment.
Options to resolve this problem are dis-cussed in Barnard et al (1995) and several other2The OHCO-Thesis, first presented in DeRose et al(1990) states ?that text is best represented as an ordered hier-archy of content object (OHCO).?85proposals.
To avoid drawbacks of the above men-tioned approaches Witt (2002; 2004) discusses anXML based solution which is used in our project.2.1 RepresentationWe address the issue of overlapping markup byusing separate annotations of relevant phenomena(e.g., syntactic information, POS, document struc-ture) according to different document grammars,i.e., the same textual data is encoded several times(in separate files).
One advantage of this multipleannotation is that the modeling of information ona level A is not dependent in any way on a levelB (in contrast to the standoff annotation modeldescribed by Thompson and McKelvie (1997),where a primary modeling level is needed).
Addi-tional annotation layers can be added easily with-out any changes to the layers already established.The primary data (i.e., the text which will be an-notated) is separated from the markup and servesas key element for establishing relations betweenthe annotation tiers.
Witt et al (2005) describe aknowledge representation format (in the program-ming language Prolog3) which can be used to drawinferences between separate levels of annotationsand in which the parts of text (the PCDATA inXML terms) are used as an absolute reference sys-tem and as link between the levels of annotation(cf.
Bayerl et al (2003)).This representation format allows us to use var-ious linguistic resources.
A Python script con-verts the different annotation layers (XML Docu-ments) to the above mentioned Prolog representa-tion which serves as input for the unification pro-cess.
The elements, attributes and text of all an-notation layers are stored as Prolog predicates.
Asa requirement all files must be identical with re-spect to their underlying character data, what wecall identity of primary data.2.2 UnificationFigure 1 shows the architecture used for the uni-fication process.
Different annotation layers areunified, i.e., merged into one output fact base.A script reconverts the Prolog representation intoone well-formed XML document containing theannotations from the layers plus the textual con-tent.
In case of overlapping elements (which maybe the result of the unification), it converts those3An additional representation format integrates the repre-sentation of multi-rooted trees developed in the NITE-Project(cf.
Carletta et al (2003)).elements to milestones or fragments (cf.
TEIGuidelines (2004)) according to parameter op-tions.
A Java-based GUI is available to ease theuse of the above mentioned framework.3 Multi-rooted treesBased on the before mentioned architecture wenow focus on the usage of heterogeneous linguis-tic resources (as described in in Section 1) in or-der to semi-automatically add layers of markup tovarious XML (or plain text) documents.
We pre-fer the term multi-rooted trees in favor of multi-ple annotations, i.e., different layers of annotationare stored in a single representation (based on theabove mentioned architecture).
The input docu-ment is separated into the textual information andthe annotation tree (if there is any).
Both of theseare provided as input for linguistic resources.
Theoutput of this process (typically an XML anno-tated document) is again separated into text andmarkup and serves as input for another resource.Figure 2 gives an overview over the process.4 Heterogeneous linguistic resources foranaphora resolution: a case studyWe use multi-rooted trees in order to annotate andmodel coreferential phenomena and anaphoric re-lations (cf.
Sasaki et al(2002)).
Base for theresolution of anaphoric relations (both pronomi-nal anaphora and definite description anaphora) isa small test corpus containing German newspaperarticles and scientific articles in German and En-glish.
Figure 3 shows an excerpt of a Germannewspaper article taken from ?Die Zeit?.
In thisexample the first linguistic resource to apply isa parser (in our case Machinese Syntax by Con-nexor Oy).
As a second step an XSLT script usesthe input document and the parser output and tagsdiscourse entities (see element de in Figure 3) byjudging several syntactic criteria provided by theparser.
The discourse entities mark the startingpoint to determine anaphora-antecedent-relationsbetween pairs of discourse entities.In order to resolve bridging relations (e.g.,?door?
as a meronym of ?room?
), WordNet (Ger-maNet for German texts) is used as a linguisticresource to establish relationships between dis-course entities according to the information storedin the synsets4.
By now, we use an Open Source4A synset represents a concept and consists of a set of oneor more synonyms.86Figure 1: Overview of the architectureFigure 2: Using heterogeneous linguistic resources1 <doc_article>2 <doc_sect1>3 <doc_title/>4 <doc_para>5 <chs_sentence id="s22">6 <chs_de deLemma="rolf" deID="de_n_078" deType="nom">Marie Rolfs</chs_de> ist <chs_de deLemma="jahr" deID="de_n_079" deType="nom">vier Jahre</chs_de> alt.7 </chs_sentence>8 <chs_sentence id="s23">9 Mit <chs_de deLemma="petra" deID="de_n_080" deType="nom">ihrerZwillingsschwester Petra</chs_de>, <chs_de deLemma="bruder" deID="de_n_081"deType="nom">ihrem achtja?hrigen Bruder</chs_de> und <chs_de deLemma="mutter"deID="de_n_082" deType="nom">ihrer Mutter Sabine</chs_de> wohnt <chs_de deLemma="sie" deID="de_n_083" deType="nom">sie</chs_de> in <chs_de deLemma="dreizimmerwohnung" deID="de_n_084" deType="nom">einer Dreizimmerwohnung in <chs_de deLemma="rahlstedt" deID="de_n_085" deType="nom">Rahlstedt a<chs_dedeLemma="stadt#rand" deID="de_n_086" deType="nom">m o?stlichen HamburgerStadtrand</chs_de> </chs_de> </chs_de>.10 </chs_sentence>11 <chs_semRel>12 <chs_cospecLink relType="poss" phorIDRef="de_n_080" antecedentIDRefs="de_n_078"/>13 <chs_cospecLink relType="poss" phorIDRef="de_n_081" antecedentIDRefs="de_n_078"/>14 <chs_cospecLink relType="poss" phorIDRef="de_n_082" antecedentIDRefs="de_n_078"/>15 <chs_cospecLink relType="ident" phorIDRef="de_n_083" antecedentIDRefs="de_n_078"/>16 </chs_semRel>17 </doc_para>18 </doc_sect1>19 </doc_article>Figure 3: An extract of a German newspaper article marked up by several linguistic resources87native XML database5 as test tool for querying theGermaNet data6.
Resolving synonymous or hy-peronymous anaphoric relations is done by usingXPath or XQuery queries on pairs of discourse en-tities.
Bridging relations are harder to track downand will be focused on in the near future.Figure 3 shows the shortened and manually re-vised output of the anaphora resolution.
In thisexample two annotation layers have been merged:the logical document structure (in our case a mod-dified version of DocBook, doc) and the levelof semantic relations (chs).
The logical docu-ment structure describes the organisation of thetext document in terms of chapters, sections, para-graphs, and the like.
The level of semantic re-lations describes discourse entities and relationsbetween them.
Corpus investigations give rise tothe supposition that the logical text structure in-fluences the search scope of candidates for an-tecedents.
Anaphoric relations are annotated witha cospecLink element (lines 12 to 15).
Theattribute relType holds the type of relation be-tween two discourse entities.
Line 15 is an exam-ple of an identity relation between discourse entityde n 078 (?Marie Rolfs?, line 6) and discourseentity de n 083 (?sie?, line 9) whereby the firstis marked as antecedent.5 ConclusionThe architecture shown in this paper provides ac-cess to multiple layers of linguistic annotation andallows for the reuse and integration of existing lin-guistic resources.
The resulting additional annota-tion layers are extremely useful for solving com-plex linguistic issues like anaphora resolution.
Itis our goal to enable a semi-automatic anaphoraresolution by the end of the project life-span.ReferencesBarnard, David, Burnard, Lou, Gaspart, Jean-PierreGaspart, Price, Lynne A., Spergerg-McQueen, C. M.and Giovanni Battista Varile.
