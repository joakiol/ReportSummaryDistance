A Pro ject  Report  on NP:  an Assumpt ion .basedNL Plan Inference System that uses Feature StructuresJohn K. MyersATR Interpreting Telephony Research LaboratoriesSanpeidani, Inuidani, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto 619-02, Japanmyers@atr-la.atr.co.jpAbst rac tThis paper presents a project report on NP, a working Naturallanguage Plan inference system that uses feature structuresand is based on assumptions.
Input to the system is in theform of feature structures, which can be taken directly fromthe output of a semantic parser.
Plan actions are representedby feature-structure plan schemata with preconditions, hier-arclfical decompositions, and effects.
Output is in the form ofa network of believed assertions represented in a knowledgebase, and can be reported, used to answer generation-systemqueries, or drive side-effecting demons.
The plan inferencecomponent is implemented using a feature-structure-based in-ference ngine and models of plan recognition, prediction, andinference.
The inference ngine is implemented using a rewrit-ing system for patteru-matctfing, and an Assumption-basedTruth Maintenance System (ATMS) for conjunctions.
TheArMS allows pre-instantiation f hypothetically known as-sertions and implications, which can significantly reduce pro-cessing time.
The ATMS also permits imultaneous consider-ation of multiple possible inputs or multiple possible inferredplan outputs; these can be mutually conflicting or supportive.This capability will be important for disambiguation.
The NPsystem is used to infer dialog- and domaln-level p ans, amongother types.Original contributions include: a plan inference systemthat works directly from feature structures; a plan inferencesystem that uses an ATMS and plan schema ctions with pre-conditions and effects to infer hierarchical nd chained plans;and, an inference ngine that works with multiple feature-structure assertions and rules.Project  Goal.
This project is aimed towarda dialog understanding system that can be used aspart of an automatic interpreting telephone system.Interpretation will be performed by parsing, trans-ferring, and generating utterances.
Thus, dialog un-derstanding will be used to recognize speech acts andillocutionary acts, resolve ellipses, and provide re-quired missing information, among other tasks.
Theunderstanding system will use the output of the se-mantic parser, and provide information to the trans-fer module and generation system.
Therefore, fea-ture structures hould be used as the basic datarepresentation scheme.
Dialog understanding re-quires a general-purpose plan inference ngine thatcan work with dialog plans, domain plans, common-sense knowledge plans, and so forth.
The systemmust also in the future be able to perform disam-biguation of possible utterances.Background: Assumptions.
The plans, in-tentions, beliefs, etc., of a human are menial con-cepts which cannot be perceived irectly', they areunobservable\[Mye88\].
There is insufficient infor-mation to represent these concepts with certainty.Therefore, the system must be able to represent con-cepts in an uncertain manner, using assumptions.Communication between two people is inherentlyan assumption-based process.
Since it is never corn-pletely possible to directly know the concepts of an-other person, it is necessary in the course of a con-versation to take a stance and rely on assumptionsabout the other person's thoughts \[Den87\].
Thus, ina dialog understanding system, there are at least wokinds of assumptions that must be represented: as-sumptions that the two speakers make, which mustbe modeled by the system, and assumptions that thesystem makes about he situation, 1 the two speakersand their plans, intentions, etc.Design.
Plan inference and other knowledge-based reasoning tasks require that multiple conjunc-tive implications be matched against large sets ofunordered assertions.
The system will have a cat-alog of world knowledge, common-sense knowledge,and assertions which are believed by the speakers.These must be accessed non-sequentially and usedfor reasoning.
In other words, language understand-ing should be done by using an "expert system" in-ference ngine,Computer languages should be used according totheir strengths and weaknesses.
Feature-structuresystems are strong in representing complex, incom-plete, or underspecified information, and in perform-ing unification.
However, they are extremely ineffi-cient at list processing and numeric alculations (e.g.for evidential reasoning), and don't represent multi-ple possible worlds.
Lisp and other languages canfulfil these needs.One solution is to build a hybrid system.
Aninference ngine was built which uses a feature-structure language fo r representation a d pattern-matching tasks, while using an ATMS to per-form conjunctive implications, represent assump-tions, represent possible worlds, and maintain thetruth of derived belief networks when nonmonotonicchanges occur.
The ATMS allows the system to rep-resent, and reason with, all consistent possibilitiesat the same time-not just the current best choice.In particular, this permits multiple possible inferredplans to be output, and multiple possible observa-tions to be input.
This capability will become im-portant for possible utterance disambiguation.The system interprets the results of the ATMSby using a five-valued uncertainty logic consisting ofthe uncertain belief values ACTUAL, POSSIBLE, HY-POTHETICAL, INCONSISTENT, or NULL.
Each  asser-1 Currently, most dialog understanding systems tart withthe assumptions that the hearer and speaker always under-stand each other perfectly, that they automatically want tocooperate as much as possible, and that they have absolutelyno other commitments outside of the conversation.
Clearlysome of these assumptions can occasionally be incorrect.428 \]\ [ \ [ac t ion  \[\[RELN t thor t -antsuor -nogat ivo -sot -1 \ ]  .

The instruction rules arefed to the nonmonotonic rewriting system \[Has89\]and used as rewriting rules.Preinstantiation assertions are input to therewriting system.
One assertion may match sev-eral instruction rule patterns.
The recognized con-sequents consist of instructions with instantiatedvariables.
These are fed to the instruction inter-preter, which follows the instructions and instan-tiates hypothetical nodes and implications in theATMS corresponding to instantiated components ofthe plan schema.
The resulting action and effect as-sertions are fed back to the rewriting system as morehypothetical input, to instantiate whole networksbottom-up from single input facts.
Since the ATMSuses "uniquification" and never reinstantiates xist-ing assertions, this process eventually terminates.Run-time utterances are submitted to a feature-structure hash test which checks to see whether theyhave identically been instantiated in the ATMS be-fore (e.g., hypothetically, etc.).
If they have, nofurther pattern matching is required, and the corre-sponding node is asserted.
Otherwise, the input ut-terance is submitted to the rewriting system for pat-tern matching and hypothetical instantiation propa-gation, as before.
Following this, the correspondingnode is asserted as possible or actual.
Assertion trig-gers a fast spreading activation in the truth mainte-nance network (using bitvectors) which maintains allconsistent "possible worlds".
A demon attached toa particular node fires when that node first becomespossible or actual.
Demons can reset themselves bydeleting support node flags.Cur rent  Status.
NP version 2.0, reported here,has been finished and demonstrated.
Currentlyinstantiation is done in a bottom-up fashion.
Agraphic output program allows display of the ATMSnetwork.
Nodes can be moused for input or exami-nation.
A browsing editor needs to be improved toallow relevant parts of the network to be examined.The system currently works stand-alone and is readyto be integrated with a parser, a transfer system, anda language generator when they have been finished.Appl icat ions.
The plan inference system un-derstands ongoing task-oriented conversations be-tween two people, on the subject of registering for aconference.
The system serially processes the utter-ances, maintaining a representation f the currentlybelieved concepts as the conversation progresses.Currently, input to the system is a corpus of fiveconversations (20 utterances each, on average) repre-senting the expected feature-structure output of theATR parsing system, as generated by the parsingresearchers.
To date, 53 plan schemata have beenwritten, dealing with conversation opening and clos-ing sequences, "inform-if" (yes/no) questions andanswers, short answers to questions, ability utter-ances, inferred knowledge, wants and intentions, do-main plans, idioms, and common-sense knowledge.The system understands portions of all five conversa-tions.
Research is ongoing in this area.
In addition, aseparate set of 46 plans duplicating the "four-layer"recognition model \[AI89\] in feature structures hasbeen implemented and used to understand an en-tire surface-speech-act-level input conversation with20 speech-acts ( ee Figure 2); 232 feature-structureassertions were instantiated.Future  Work.
A manual is being written.
Theinstantiation method must be improved, l~epresent-ing multiple possible nonmonotonic plans is beingresearched.
It will also be necessary to representand infer plans containing conditional branches, forinformation-gathering plans in the sample dialogs 4.However, the main fimlre research deals with the de-sign of a disambiguation system.
Disambiguation isan evidential reasoning problem, and will probablyrequire that a causal reasoning system be built andintegrated with the multiple-world ATMS.Naturally, parallel research in illocutionary andperlocutionary force is also continuing.
One of thefirst things that must be done is to build a modulethat uses possible plans to resolve zero pronouns.Lack of a fully resolved utterance is hindering planrecognition.
Other work involves representing andreasoning with intentions found in a dialog.Coneluslon.
A working plan inference systemthat uses feature structures has been d,.scribed.
Thesystem can represent and reasou with assumptions,multiple possible inputs, and multiple possible re-sults.
Preinstantiation f hypothetical ssertions al-lows inference by fast spreading activation.
The re-sulting system can be used to infer plans directlyfrom the output of a s?.naantic~, parser, and provideinformation directly to a transfer or generation sys-tem, as part of an automatic interpretation system.References\[AI89\] Hidekazu Arita and Hitoshi Iida.
