We represent per-formance with two metrics: user satis-faction and student learning.
We trainand test predictive models of these met-rics in our tutoring system corpora.
Wepredict user satisfaction with 2 parametertypes: 1) system-generic, and 2) tutoring-specific.
To predict student learning, wealso use a third type: 3) user affect.
Al-hough generic parameters are useful pre-dictors of user satisfaction in other PAR-ADISE applications, overall our parame-ters produce less useful user satisfactionmodels in our system.
However, genericand tutoring-specific parameters do pro-duce useful models of student learning inour system.
User affect parameters can in-crease the usefulness of these models.1 IntroductionIn recent years the development of spoken dialoguetutoring systems has become more prevalent, in anattempt to close the performance gap between hu-man and computer tutors (Mostow and Aist, 2001;Pon-Barry et al, 2004; Litman et al, 2006).
Studentlearning is a primary metric for evaluating the per-formance of these systems; it can be measured, e.g.,by comparing student pretests taken prior to systemuse with posttests taken after system use.In other types of spoken dialogue systems, theuser?s subjective judgments about using the systemare often considered a primary system performancemetric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measuredvia surveys which ask users to rate systems duringuse along dimensions such as task ease, speech in-put/output quality, user expectations and expertise,and user future use (Mo?ller, 2005b; Walker et al,2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al, 2000; Walker et al,2000; Shriberg et al, 1992).
However, it is expen-sive to run experiments over large numbers of usersto obtain reliable system performance measures.The PARADISE model (Walker et al, 1997) pro-poses instead to predict system performance, usingparameters representing interaction costs and bene-fits between system and user, including task success,dialogue efficiency, and dialogue quality.
More for-mally, a set of interaction parameters are measuredin a spoken dialogue system corpus, then used ina multivariate linear regression to predict the targetperformance variable.
The resulting model is de-scribed by the formula below, where there are n in-teraction parameters, pi, each weighted by the anal-ysis with a coefficient, wi, which will be negativeor positive, depending on whether the model treatspi as a cost or benefit, respectively.
The model canthen be used to estimate performance during systemdesign, with the design goals of minimizing costsand maximizing benefits.System Performance = ?ni=1 wi * piWe investigate using PARADISE to develop pre-dictive models of performance in our spoken dia-logue tutoring system.

We thus use 2 metrics to representperformance: 1) a generic metric of user satisfactioncomputed via user survey, 2) a tutoring-specific met-ric of student learning computed via student pretestand posttest scores.
We train and test predictivemodels of these metrics on multiple system corpora.To predict user satisfaction, we use 2 types of in-teraction parameters: 1) system-generic parameterssuch as used in other PARADISE applications, e.g.speech recognition performance, and 2) tutoring-specific parameters, e.g.
student correctness.
Topredict student learning, we also use a third type ofparameter: 3) manually annotated user affect.
Al-though prior PARADISE applications have tended touse system-generic parameters, we hypothesize thattask-specific and user affect parameters may alsoprove useful.
We emphasize that user affect parame-ters are still system-generic; user affect has been an-notated and/or automatically predicted in other typesof spoken dialogue systems, e.g.
as in (Lee et al,2002; Ang et al, 2002; Batliner et al, 2003).Our results show that, although generic param-eters were useful predictors of user satisfaction inother PARADISE applications, overall our parame-ters produce less useful user satisfaction models inour tutoring system.
However, generic and tutoring-specific parameters do produce useful models of stu-dent learning in our system.
Generic user affect pa-rameters increase the usefulness of these models.2 Spoken Dialogue Tutoring CorporaITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialoguesystem) (Litman et al, 2006) is a speech-enabled tu-tor built on top of the text-based Why2-Atlas con-ceptual physics tutor (VanLehn et al, 2002).
InITSPOKE, a student first types an essay into aweb-based interface answering a qualitative physicsproblem.
ITSPOKE then analyzes the essay and en-gages the student in spoken dialogue to correct mis-conceptions and elicit more complete explanations.Student speech is digitized from the microphone in-put and sent to the Sphinx2 recognizer.
Sphinx2?smost probable ?transcription?
is then sent to Why2-Atlas for syntactic, semantic and dialogue analy-sis.
Finally, the text response produced by Why2-Atlas is converted to speech as described below, thenplayed in the student?s headphones and displayed onthe interface.
After the dialogue, the student revisesthe essay, thereby ending the tutoring or causing an-other round of tutoring/essay revision.For this study, we used 3 ITSPOKE corpora,shown in Table 1.1 The SYN03 corpus was col-lected in 2003 for an evaluation comparing learn-ing in typed and spoken human and computer tu-toring (Litman et al, 2006).
ITSPOKE?s voice wassynthesized with the Cepstral text-to-speech system,and its speech recognizer was trained from pilot IT-SPOKE studies and Why2-Atlas evaluations.
ThePR05 and SYN05 corpora were collected in 2005,to evaluate the impact of tutor voice quality (Forbes-Riley et al, 2006).
For these 2 corpora, ITSPOKEused an updated speech recognizer further trainedon the SYN03 corpus.
For the SYN05 corpus, IT-SPOKE used the synthesized tutor voice from theSYN03 corpus; for the PR05 corpus, ITSPOKEused a pre-recorded tutor voice from a paid voicetalent.
Figure 1 gives an annotated (Section 3) PR05excerpt (ASR shows what ITSPOKE heard).The same experimental procedure was used tocollect all 3 ITSPOKE corpora: college studentswho had taken no college physics: 1) read asmall document of background material, 2) tooka pretest measuring initial physics knowledge, 3)work through a set of 5 problems (dialogues) withITSPOKE, 4) took a posttest similar to the pretest.1The user populations of the 2005 corpora and 2003 corpusare different, due to variation in year and recruitment method.265Subjects in the PR05 and SYN05 corpora alsocompleted a survey probing user satisfaction aftertaking the posttest (SYN03 corpus subjects did not).Our survey, shown in Figure 2, is essentially thesame as the one used in the DARPA Communicatormulti-site evaluation (Walker et al, 2002).
Althoughtailored lexically for a tutoring system, these state-ments are generally applicable to spoken dialoguesystems.
Students rated their degree of agreementwith each statement on a scale of 1 to 5.PHYSICS PROBLEM: Suppose a lightweight car and a mas-sive truck hit a patch of frictionless ice and have a head-on col-lision.

word error rate), measures of dialoguecommunication and efficiency (e.g.
total turns andelapsed time), and measures of task completion (e.g.a binary representation of whether the task was com-pleted) (Mo?ller, 2005a; Mo?ller, 2005b; Walker et al,2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al, 2000; Walker et al,2000; Walker et al, 1997).
In this prior work, eachdialogue between user and system represents a sin-gle ?task?
(e.g., booking airline travel), thus thesemeasures are calculated on a per-dialogue basis.In our work, the entire tutoring session representsa single ?task?, and every student in our corporacompleted this task.
Thus we extract 13 system-generic parameters on a per-student basis, i.e.
overthe 5 dialogues for each user, yielding a single pa-rameter value for each student in our 3 corpora.First, we extracted 9 parameters representing dia-logue communication and efficiency.
Of these pa-rameters, 7 were used in prior PARADISE appli-cations: Time on Task, Total ITSPOKE Turns andWords, Total User Turns and Words, Average IT-SPOKE Words/Turn, and Average User Words/Turn.Our 2 additional ?communication-related?
(Mo?ller,2005a) parameters measure system-user interactiv-ity, but were not used in prior work (to our knowl-edge): Ratio of User Words to ITSPOKE Words, Ra-tio of User Turns to ITSPOKE Turns.Second, we extracted 4 parameters representingspeech recognition quality, which have also beenused in prior work: Word Error Rate, Concept Ac-curacy, Total Timeouts, Total Rejections2 .3.2 Tutoring-Specific ParametersAlthough prior PARADISE applications tend touse system-generic parameters, we hypothesize thattask-specific parameters may also prove useful forpredicting performance.
We extract 12 tutoring-specific parameters over the 5 dialogues for each stu-dent, yielding a single parameter value per student,for each student in our 3 corpora.
Although these pa-rameters are specific to our tutoring system, similarparameters are available in other tutoring systems.First, we hypothesize that the correctness of thestudents?
turns with respect to the tutoring topic2A Timeout occurs when ITSPOKE does not hear speechby a pre-specified time interval.
A Rejection occurs when IT-SPOKE?s confidence score for its ASR output is too low.266(physics, in our case) may play a role in predictingsystem performance.
Each of our student turns isautomatically labeled with 1 of 3 ?Correctness?
la-bels by the ITSPOKE semantic understanding com-ponent: Correct, Incorrect, Partially Correct.
La-beled examples are shown in Figure 1.
From these3 Correctness labels, we derive 9 parameters: a To-tal and a Percent for each label, and a Ratio of eachlabel to every other label (e.g.
Correct/Incorrect).Second, students write and then may modify theirphysics essay at least once during each dialogue withITSPOKE.
We thus hypothesize that like ?Correct-ness?, the total number of essays per student mayplay a role in predicting system performance.Finally, although student test scores before/afterusing ITSPOKE will be used as our student learningmetric, we hypothesize that these scores may alsoplay a role in predicting user satisfaction.3.3 User Affect ParametersWe hypothesize that user affect plays a role in pre-dicting user satisfaction and student learning.
Al-though affect parameters have not been used in otherPARADISE studies (to our knowledge), they aregeneric; for example, in various spoken dialoguesystems, user affect has been annotated and automat-ically predicted from e.g., acoustic-prosodic and lex-ical features (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b; Leeet al, 2002; Ang et al, 2002; Batliner et al, 2003).As part of a larger investigation into emotionadaptation, we are manually annotating the stu-dent turns in our corpora for affective state.
Cur-rently, we are labeling 1 of 4 states of ?Certain-ness?
: certain, uncertain, neutral, mixed (certainand uncertain), and we are separately labeling 1of 2 states of ?Frustration/Anger?
: frustrated/angry,non-frustrated/angry.
These affective states3 werefound in pilot studies to be most prevalent in our tu-toring dialogues4 , and are also of interest in otherdialogue research, e.g.
tutoring (Bhatt et al, 2004;Moore et al, 2004; Pon-Barry et al, 2004) and spo-ken dialogue (Ang et al, 2002).
Labeled examplesare shown in Figure 1.5 To date, one paid annotator3We use ?affect?
and ?affective state?
loosely to cover stu-dent emotions and attitudes believed to be relevant for tutoring.4For a full list of affective states identified in these pilot stud-ies, see (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004a).5Annotations were performed from both audio and tran-has labeled all student turns in our SYN03 corpus,and all the turns of 17 students in our PR05 corpus.6From these labels, we derived 25 User Affect pa-rameters per student, over the 5 dialogues for thatstudent.
First, for each Certainness label, we com-puted a Total, a Percent, and a Ratio to each other la-bel.
We also computed a Total for each sequence ofidentical Certainness labels (e.g.
Certain:Certain),hypothesizing that states maintained over multipleturns may have more impact on performance thansingle occurrences.
Second, we computed the sameparameters for each Frustration/Anger label.4 Prediction ModelsIn this section, we first investigate the usefulness ofour system-generic and tutoring-specific parametersfor training models of user satisfaction and studentlearning in our tutoring corpora with the PARADISEframework.
We use the SPSS statistical packagewith a stepwise multivariate linear regression pro-cedure7 to automatically determine parameter inclu-sion in the model.
We then investigate how wellthese models generalize across different user-systemconfigurations, by testing the models in differentcorpora and corpus subsets.
Finally, we investigatewhether generic user affect parameters increase theusefulness of our student learning models.4.1 Prediction Models of User SatisfactionOnly subjects in the PR05 and SYN05 corpora com-pleted a user survey (Table 1).
Each student?s re-sponses were summed to yield a single user satis-faction total per student, ranging from 9 to 24 acrosscorpora (the possible range is 5 to 25), with no dif-ference between corpora (p = .46).
This total wasused as our user satisfaction metric, as in (Mo?ller,2005b; Walker et al, 2002; Walker et al, 2000).8scription within a speech processing tool.6In a preliminary agreement study, a second annotator la-beled the entire SYN03 corpus for uncertain versus other, yield-ing 90% inter-annotator agreement (0.68 Kappa).7At each step, the parameter with the highest partial correla-tion with the target predicted variable, controlled for all previ-ously entered parameters, is entered in the equation, until the re-maining parameters do not increase R2 by a significant amountor do not yield a significant model.8Researchers have also used average score (Mo?ller, 2005b;Walker et al, 1997); single survey statements can also beused (Walker et al, 1997).
We tried these variations, and ourR2 results were similar, indicating robustness across variations.267Training Data R2 Predictors Testing Data R2PR05 .274 INCORRECTS, ESSAYS SYN05 .001SYN05 .068 TUT WDS/TRN PR05 .018PR05:half1 .335 PARTCORS/INCORS PR05:half2 .137PR05:half2 .443 STU TRNS PR05:half1 .079SYN05:half1 .455 STU TRNS/TUT TRNS SYN05:half2 .051SYN05:half2 .685 TUT WDS/TRN, STU WDS/TRN, CORRECTS SYN05:half1 .227Table 2: Testing the Predictive Power of User Satisfaction ModelsWe trained a user satisfaction model on each cor-pus, then tested it on the other corpus.
In addition,we split each corpus in half randomly, then traineda user satisfaction model on each half, and testedit on the other half.
We hypothesized that despitethe decrease in the dataset size, models trained andtested in the same corpus would have higher gen-eralizability than models trained on one corpus andtested on the other, due to the increased data homo-geneity within each corpus, since each corpus used adifferent ITSPOKE version.
As predictors, we usedonly the 13 system-generic and 12 tutoring-specificparameters that were available for all subjects.Results are shown in Table 2.
The first and fourthcolumns show the training and test data, respec-tively.
The second and fifth columns show the usersatisfaction variance accounted for by the trainedmodel in the training and test data, respectively.
Thethird column shows the parameters that were se-lected as predictors of user satisfaction in the trainedmodel, ordered by degree of contribution9 .For example, as shown in the first row, the modeltrained on the PR05 corpus uses Total Incorrect stu-dent turns as the strongest predictor of user satis-faction, followed by Total Essays; these parametersare not highly correlated10 .
This model accounts for27.4% of the user satisfaction variance in the PR05corpus.
When tested on the SYN05 corpus, it ac-counts for 0.1% of the user satisfaction variance.The low R2 values for both training and testingin the first two rows show that neither corpus yields9The ordering reflects the standardized coefficients (betaweights), which are computed in SPSS based on scaling ofthe input parameters, to enable an assessment of the predictivepower of each parameter relative to the others in a model.10Hereafter, predictors in a model are not highly correlated(R ?

Linear regression does not assume thatpredictors are independent, only that they are not highly corre-lated.
Because correlations above R =.70 can affect the coeffi-cients, deletion of redundant predictors may be advisable.a very powerful model of user satisfaction even inthe training corpus, and this model does not gener-alize very well to the test corpus.
As hypothesized,training and testing in a single corpus yields higherR2 values for testing, as shown in the last four rows,although these models still account for less than aquarter of the variance in the test data.
The increasedR2 values for training here may indicate over-fitting.Across all 6 experiments, there is almost no overlapof parameters used to predict user satisfaction.Overall, these results show that this method ofdeveloping an ITSPOKE user satisfaction modelis very sensitive to changes in training data;this was also found in other PARADISE applica-tions (Mo?ller, 2005b; Walker et al, 2000).
Someapplications have also reported similarly low R2 val-ues for testing both within a corpus (Mo?ller, 2005b)and also when a model trained on one system cor-pus is tested on another system corpus (Walker etal., 2000).
However, most PARADISE applicationshave yielded higher R2 values than ours for train-ing (Mo?ller, 2005b; Walker et al, 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al, 2000; Walker et al, 2000).We hypothesize two reasons for why our exper-iments did not yield more useful user satisfactionmodels.
First, in prior PARADISE applications,users completed a survey after every dialogue withthe system.
In our case, subjects completed only onesurvey, at the end of the experiment (5 dialogues).
Itmay be that this ?per-student?
unit for user satisfac-tion is too large to yield a very powerful model; i.e.,this measure is not fine-grained enough.
In addi-tion, tutoring systems are not designed to maximizeuser satisfaction, but rather, their design goal is tomaximize student learning.
Moreover, prior tutor-ing studies have shown that certain features corre-lated with student learning do not have the same re-lationship to user satisfaction (e.g.
are not predictive268Training Data R2 Predictors Testing Data R2PR05 .556 PRE, %CORRECT SYN05 .636SYN05 .736 PRE, INCORS/CORS, STU WDS/TRN PR05 .472PR05:half1 .840 PRE, PARTCORRECTS PR05:half2 .128PR05:half2 .575 PARTCORS/INCORS, PRE PR05:half1 .485SYN05:half1 .580 PRE, STU WDS/TRN SYN05:half2 .556SYN05:half2 .855 PRE, TIMEOUTS SYN05:half1 .384PR05+SYN03 .413 PRE, TIME SYN05 .586PR05+SYN05 .621 PRE, INCORS/CORS SYN03 .237SYN05+SYN03 .590 INCORS/CORS, PR05 .244%INCORRECT, PRE, TIMETable 3: Testing the Predictive Power of Student Learning Models with the Same Datasetsor have an opposite relationship) (Pon-Barry et al,2004).
In fact, it may be that user satisfaction is nota metric of primary relevance in our application.4.2 Prediction Models of Student LearningAs in other tutoring research, e.g.
(Chi et al, 2001;Litman et al, 2006), we use posttest score (POST)controlled for pretest score (PRE) as our target stu-dent learning prediction metric, such that POST isour target variable and PRE is always a parameterin the final model, although it is not necessarily thestrongest predictor.11 In this way, we measure stu-dent learning gains, not just final test score.As shown in Table 1, all subjects in our 3 corporatook the pretest and posttest.
However, in order tocompare our student learning models with our usersatisfaction models, our first experiments predictingstudent learning used the same training and testingdatasets that were used to predict user satisfaction inSection 4.1 (i.e.
we ran the same experiments exceptwe predicted POST controlled for PRE instead ofuser satisfaction).
Results are shown in the first 6rows of Table 3.As shown, these 6 models all account for morethan 50% of the POST variance in the training data.Furthermore, most of them account for close to, ormore than, 50% of the POST variance in the testdata.
Although again we hypothesized that trainingand testing in one corpus would yield higher R2 val-ues for testing, this is not consistently the case; twoof these models had the highest R2 values for train-11In SPSS, we regress two independent variable blocks.
Thefirst block contains PRE, which is regressed with POST usingthe ?enter?
method, forcing inclusion of PRE in the final model.The second block contains all remaining independent variables,which are regressed using the stepwise method.ing and the lowest R2 values for testing (PR05:half1and SYN05:half2), suggesting over-fitting.Overall, these results show that this is an effec-tive method of developing a prediction model of stu-dent learning for ITSPOKE, and is less sensitive tochanges in training data than it was for user satis-faction.
Moreover, there is more overlap in these6 models of parameters that are useful for predict-ing student learning (besides PRE); ?Correctness?parameters and dialogue communication and effi-ciency parameters appear to be most useful overall.Our next 3 experiments investigated how our stu-dent learning models are impacted by including ourthird SYN03 corpus.
Using the same 25 parame-ters, we trained a learning model on each set of twocombined corpora, then tested it on the other corpus.Results are shown in the last 3 rows of Table 3.As shown, these models still account for closeto, or more than, 50% of the student learning vari-ance in the training data.12 The model trainedon PR05+SYN03 accounts for the most studentlearning variance in the test data, showing that thetraining data that is most similar to the test datawill yield the highest generalizability.
That is,the combined PR05+SYN03 corpora contains sub-jects drawn from the same subject pool (2005) asthe SYN05 test data, and also contains subjectswho interacted with the same tutor voice (synthe-sized) as this test data.
In contrast, the combinedPR05+SYN05 corpora did not overlap in user pop-ulation with the SYN03 test data, and the combinedSYN05+SYN03 corpora did not share a tutor voicewith the PR05 test data.

As shown in Table 1,all 20 subjects in our SYN03 corpus were annotatedfor user affect, and 17 subjects in our PR05 corpuswere annotated for user affect.
We trained a modelof student learning on each of these datasets, thentested it on the other dataset.13 As predictors, weincluded our 25 user affect parameters along withthe 13 system-generic and 12 tutoring-specific inter-action parameters.
These results are shown in thefirst two rows of Table 4.
We also reran these ex-periments without user affect parameters, to gaugethe impact of the user affect parameters.
These re-sults are shown in the last two rows of Table 4.
Wehypothesized that user affect parameters would pro-duce more useful models, because prior tutoring re-search has shown correlations between user affectand student learning (e.g.
(Craig et al, 2004)).As shown in the first two rows, user affect predic-tors appear in both models where these parameterswere included.
The models trained on SYN03 usepretest score and Total Time on Task as predictors;when affect parameters are included, ?Neutral Cer-tainness?
is added as a predictor, which increases theR2 values for both training and testing.
However,the two models trained on PR05:17 show no predic-tor overlap (besides PRE).
Moreover, the PR05:17model that includes an affect predictor (Total Se-quence of 2 Non-Frustrated/Angry turns) has thehighest training R2, but the lowest testing R2 value.13As only 17 subjects have both user affect annotation anduser surveys, there is not enough data currently to train and testa user satisfaction model including user affect parameters.5 Conclusions and Current DirectionsPrior work in the tutoring community has focused oncorrelations of single features with learning; our re-sults suggest that PARADISE is an effective methodof extending these analyses.
For the dialogue com-munity, our results suggest that as spoken dialoguesystems move into new applications not optimizedfor user satisfaction, such as tutoring systems, othermeasures of performance may be more relevant, andgeneric user affect parameters may be useful.Our experiments used many of the same system-generic parameters as prior studies, and some ofthese parameters predicted user satisfaction both inour models and in prior studies?
models (e.g., sys-tem words/turn (Walker et al, 2002)).
Nonetheless,overall our user satisfaction models were not verypowerful even for training, were sensitive to trainingdata changes, showed little predictor overlap, anddid not generalize well to test data.
Our user sat-isfaction metric may not be fine-grained enough; inother PARADISE studies, users took a survey afterevery dialogue with the system.
In addition, tutoringsystems are not designed to maximize user satisfac-tion; their goal is to maximize student learning.Our student learning models were much morepowerful and less sensitive to changes in trainingdata.
Our best models explained over 50% of the stu-dent learning variance for training and testing, andboth student ?Correctness?
parameters and dialoguecommunication and efficiency parameters were of-ten useful predictors.
User affect parameters furtherimproved the predictive power of one student learn-ing model for both training and testing.Once our user affect annotations are complete,we can further investigate their use to predict stu-dent learning and user satisfaction.
Unlike ourother parameters, these annotations are not currentlyavailable, although they can be predicted automati-cally (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b), in our sys-270tem.
However, as in (Batliner et al, 2003), our priorwork suggests that linguistic features reflective of af-fective states can replace affect annotation (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2005).
In future work we will usesuch features in our prediction models.
Finally, weare also annotating tutor and student dialogue actsand automating the tutor act annotations; when com-plete we can investigate their usefulness in our pre-diction models; dialogue acts have also been used inprior PARADISE applications (Mo?ller, 2005a).AcknowledgementsNSF (0325034 & 0328431) supports this research.We thank Pam Jordan and the NLP Group.ReferencesJ.
