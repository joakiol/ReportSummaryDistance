Seventeams submitted final results to the EPI task inthe shared task, with the highest-performingsystem achieving 53% F-score in the full taskand 69% F-score in the extraction of a simpli-fied set of core event arguments.1 IntroductionThe Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifica-tions (EPI) task is a shared task on event extrac-tion from biomedical domain scientific publications,first introduced as a main task in the BioNLP SharedTask 2011 (Kim et al, 2011a).The EPI task focuses on events relating to epige-netic change, including DNA methylation and hi-stone methylation and acetylation (see e.g.
(Hol-liday, 1987; Jaenisch and Bird, 2003)), as wellas other common protein post-translational modi-fications (PTMs) (Witze et al, 2007).
PTMs arechemical modifications of the amino acid residuesof proteins, and DNA methylation a parallel mod-ification of the nucleotides on DNA.
While thesemodifications are chemically simple reactions andcan thus be straightforwardly represented in full de-tail, they have a crucial role in the regulation ofgene expression and protein function: the modifi-cations can alter the conformation of DNA or pro-teins and thus control their ability to associate withother molecules, making PTMs key steps in proteinbiosynthesis for introducing the full range of proteinfunctions.
For instance, protein phosphorylation ?the attachment of phosphate ?
is a common mecha-nism for activating or inactivating enzymes by alter-ing the conformation of protein active sites (Stocket al, 1989; Barford et al, 1998), and protein ubiq-uitination ?
the post-translational attachment of thesmall protein ubiquitin ?
is the first step of a majormechanism for the destruction (breakdown) of manyproteins (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002).Many of the PTMs targeted in the EPI task in-volve modification of histone, a core protein thatforms an octameric complex that has a crucial role inpackaging chromosomal DNA.
The level of methy-lation and acetylation of histones controls the tight-ness of the chromatin structure, and only ?unwound?chromatin exposes the gene packed around the hi-stone core to the transcriptional machinery.
Sincehistone modification is of substantial current inter-est in epigenetics, we designed aspects of the EPItask to capture the full detail in which histone mod-ification events are stated in text.
Finally, the DNAmethylation of gene regulatory elements controls theexpression of the gene by altering the affinity withwhich DNA-binding proteins (including transcrip-tion factors) bind, and highly methylated genes arenot transcribed at all (Riggs, 1975; Holliday andPugh, 1975).
DNA methylation can thus ?switchoff?
genes, ?removing?
them from the genome in away that is reversible through DNA demethylation.16Figure 1: Three views of protein methylation.
a)chemical formula b) event representation c) modificationdatabase entry.The BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Extrac-tion (Kim et al, 2009), the first task in the presentshared task series, involved the extraction of nineevent types including one PTM type, PHOSPHORY-LATION.
The results of the shared task showed thisPTM event to be the single most reliably extractedevent type in the task, with the best-performingsystem for the type achieving 91% precision and76% recall (83% F-score) in its extraction (Buykoet al, 2009).
The results suggest both that theevent representation is well applicable to PTM ex-traction and that current extraction methods are ca-pable of reliable PTM extraction.
The EPI taskfollows up on these opportunities, introducing spe-cific, strongly biologically motivated extraction tar-gets that are expected to be both feasible for high-accuracy event extraction, relevant to the needs ofpresent-day molecular biology, and closely appli-cable to biomolecular database curation needs (seeFigure 1) (Ohta et al, 2010a).2 Task SettingThe EPI task is an event extraction task in the sensepopularized by a number of recent domain resourcesand challenges (e.g.
(Pyysalo et al, 2007; Kim et al,2008; Thompson et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2009; Ana-niadou et al, 2010)).
In broad outline, the task fo-cuses on the extraction of information on statementsregarding change in the state or properties of (physi-cal) entities, modeled using an event representation.Figure 2: Illustration of the event representation.
Anevent of type METHYLATION (expressed through the text?methylation?)
with two participants of the types PRO-TEIN (?histone H3?)
and ENTITY (?Lys9?
), participatingin the event in Theme and Site roles, respectively.In this representation, events are typed n-ary asso-ciations of participants (entities or other events) inspecific roles.
Events are bound to specific expres-sions in text (the event trigger or text binding) andare primary objects of annotation, allowing them tobe marked in turn e.g.
as negated or as participantsin other events.
Figure 2 illustrates these concepts.In its specific formulation, EPI broadly followsthe definition of the BioNLP?09 shared task on eventextraction.
Basic modification events are definedsimilarly to the PHOSPHORYLATION event type tar-geted in the ?09 and the 2011 GE and ID tasks (Kimet al, 2011b; Pyysalo et al, 2011b), with the fulltask extending previously defined arguments withtwo additional ones, Sidechain and Contextgene.2.1 EntitiesThe EPI task follows the general policy of theBioNLP Shared Task in isolating the basic task ofnamed entity recognition from the event extractiontask by providing task participants with manuallyannotated gene and gene product entities as a start-ing point for extraction.
The entity types follow theBioNLP?09 Shared Task scheme, where genes andtheir products are simply marked as PROTEIN.1In addition to the given PROTEIN entities, someevents involve other entities, such as the modifica-tion Site.
These entities are not given and must thusbe identified by systems targeting the full task (seeSection 4).
In part to reduce the demands of thisentity recognition component of the task, these ad-ditional entities are not given specific types but aregenerically marked as ENTITY.1While most of the modifications targeted in the task involveproteins, this naming is somewhat inaccurate for the Themes ofDNA METHYLATION and DNA DEMETHYLATION events andfor Contextgene arguments, which refer to genes.
Despite thisinaccuracy, we chose to follow this naming scheme for consis-tency with other tasks.17Type Core arguments Additional argumentsHYDROXYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY)PHOSPHORYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY)UBIQUITINATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY)DNA METHYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY)GLYCOSYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY), Sidechain(ENTITY)ACETYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY), Contextgene(PROTEIN)METHYLATION Theme(PROTEIN) Site(ENTITY), Contextgene(PROTEIN)CATALYSIS Theme(Event), Cause(PROTEIN)Table 1: Event types and their arguments.
The type of entity allowed as argument is specified in parenthesis.
For eachevent type except CATALYSIS, the reverse reaction (e.g.
DEACETYLATION for ACETYLATION) is also defined, withidentical arguments.
The total number of event types in the task is thus 15.2.2 RelationsThe EPI task does not define any explicit relationextraction targets.
However, the task annotation in-volves one relation type, EQUIV.
This is a binary,symmetric, transitive relation between entities thatdefines two entities to be equivalent (Hoehndorf etal., 2010).
The relation is used in the gold annota-tion to mark local aliases such as the full and abbre-viated forms of a protein name as referring to thesame real-world entity.
While the ?09 task only rec-ognized equivalent PROTEIN entities, EPI extendson the scope of EQUIV annotations in allowing enti-ties of any type to be marked equivalent.
In evalua-tion, references to any of a set of equivalent entitiesare treated identically.2.3 EventsWhile the EPI task entity definition closely followsthat of the previous shared task, the task introducesconsiderable novelty in the targeted events, adding atotal of 14 novel event types and two new participantroles.
Table 1 summarizes the targeted event typesand their arguments.As in the BioNLP?09 shared task, Theme argu-ments identify the entity that the event is about, suchas the protein that is acetylated in an acetylationevent.
A Theme is always mandatory for all EPI taskevents.
Site arguments identify the modification siteon the Theme entity, such as a specific residue on amodified protein or a specific region on a methylatedgene.
The Sidechain argument, specific to GLYCO-SYLATION and DEGLYCOSYLATION among the tar-geted events, identifies the moiety attached or re-moved in the event (in glycosylation, the sugar).2 Fi-nally, the Contextgene argument, specific to ACETY-LATION and METHYLATION events and their re-verse reactions, identifies the gene whose expressionis controlled by these modifications.
This argumentapplies specifically for histone protein modification:the modification of the histones that form the nu-cleosomes that structure DNA are key to the epige-netic control of gene expression.
The Site, Sidechainand Contextgene arguments are not mandatory, andshould only be extracted when explicitly stated.For CATALYSIS events, representing the cataly-sis of protein or DNA modification by another pro-tein, both Theme and Cause are mandatory.
WhileCATALYSIS is a new event type, it is related tothe ?09 POSITIVE REGULATION type by a class-subclass relation: any CATALYSIS event is a POS-ITIVE REGULATION event in the ?09 task terms (butnot vice versa).2.4 Event modificationsIn addition to events, the EPI task defines twoevent modification extraction targets: NEGATIONand SPECULATION.
Both are represented as simplebinary ?flags?
that apply to events, marking them asbeing explicitly negated (e.g.
H2A is not methylated)or stated in a speculative context (e.g.
H2A may bemethylated).
Events may be both negated and spec-ulated.2Note that while arguments similar to Sidechain could bedefined for other event types also, their extraction would pro-vide no additional information: the attached molecule is alwaysacetyl in acetylation, methyl in methylation, etc.183 DataThe primary EPI task data were annotated specifi-cally for the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 and are notbased on any previously released resource.
Beforestarting this annotation effort, we performed twopreparatory studies using in part previously releasedrelated datasets: in (Ohta et al, 2010a) we consid-ered the extraction of four protein post-translationalmodifications event types with reference to annota-tions originally created for the Protein InformationResource3 (PIR) (Wu et al, 2003), and in (Ohta etal., 2010b) we studied the annotation and extractionof DNA methylation events with reference to anno-tations created for the PubMeth4 (Ongenaert et al,2008) database.
The corpus text selection and anno-tation scheme were then defined following the un-derstanding formed in these studies.3.1 Document selectionThe texts for the EPI task corpus were drawn fromPubMed abstracts.
In selecting the primary cor-pus texts, we aimed to gather a representative sam-ple of all PubMed documents relevant to selectedmodification events, avoiding bias toward, for ex-ample, specific genes/proteins, species, forms ofevent expression, or subdomains.
We primarily tar-geted DNA methylation and the ?prominent PTMtypes?
identified in (Ohta et al, 2010a).
We de-fined the following document selection protocol: foreach of the targeted event types, 1) Select a ran-dom sample of PubMed abstracts annotated with theMeSH term corresponding to the target event (e.g.Acetylation) 2) Automatically tag protein/geneentities in the selected abstracts, removing oneswhere fewer than a specific cutoff are found 3) Per-form manual filtering removing documents not rele-vant to the targeted topic (optional).MeSH is a controlled vocabulary of over 25,000terms that is used to manually annotate each docu-ment in PubMed.
By performing initial documentretrieval using MeSH terms it is possible to se-lect relevant documents without bias toward specificexpressions in text.
While search for documentstagged with e.g.
the Acetylation MeSH term issufficient to select documents relevant to the modi-3http://pir.georgetown.edu4http://www.pubmeth.org/fication, not all such documents necessarily concernspecifically protein modification, necessitating a fil-tering step.
Following preliminary experiments, wechose to apply the BANNER named entity tagger(Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) trained on the GENE-TAG corpus (Tanabe et al, 2005) and to filter docu-ments where fewer than five entities were identified.Finally, for some modification types this protocol se-lected also a substantial number of non-relevant doc-uments.
In these cases a manual filtering step wasperformed prior to full annotation to avoid markinglarge numbers of non-relevant abstracts.This primary corpus text selection protocol doesnot explicitly target reverse reactions such asdeacetylation, and the total number of these eventsin the resulting corpus was low for many types.
Tobe able to measure the extraction performance forthese types, we defined a secondary selection pro-tocol that augmented the primary protocol with aregular expression-based filter removing documentsthat did not (likely) contain mentions of reverse re-actions.
This protocol was used to select a secondaryset of test abstracts enriched in mentions of reversereactions.
Performance on this secondary test setwas also evaluated, but is not part of the primary taskevaluation.
Due to space considerations, we onlypresent the primary test set results in this paper, re-ferring to the shared task website for the secondaryresults.3.2 AnnotationAnnotation was performed manually.
Thegene/protein entities automatically detected inthe document selection step were provided toannotators for reference for creating PROTEINannotations, but all entity annotations were checkedand revised to conform to the specific guidelines forthe task.5 For the annotation of PROTEIN entities,we adopted the GENIA gene/gene product (GGP)annotation guidelines (Ohta et al, 2009), addingone specific exception: while the primary guidelinesrequire that only specific individual gene or geneproduct names are annotated, we allowed also theannotation of mentions of groups of histones or5This revision was substantial: only approximately 65% offinal PROTEIN annotations exactly match an automatically pre-dicted one due to differences in annotation criteria (Wang et al,2009).19the entire histone protein family to capture histonemodification events also in cases where only thegroup is mentioned.All event annotations were created from scratchwithout automatic support to avoid bias toward spe-cific automatic extraction methods or approaches.The event annotation follows the GENIA event cor-pus annotation guidelines (Kim et al, 2008) as theyapply to protein modifications, with CATALYSIS be-ing annotated following the criteria for the POSI-TIVE REGULATION event type with the additionalconstraints that the Cause of the event is a gene orgene product entity and the form of regulation iscatalysis of a modification reaction.The manual annotation was performed by threeexperienced annotators with a molecular biologybackground, with one chief annotator with extensiveexperience in domain event annotation organizingand supervising the annotator training and the over-all process.
After completion of primary annotation,we performed a final check targeting simple humanerrors using an automatic extraction system.6 Thiscorrection process resulted in the revision of approx-imately 2% of the event annotations.
To evaluate theconsistency of the annotation, we performed inde-pendent event annotation (taking PROTEIN annota-tions as given) for a random sample of 10% of thecorpus documents.
Comparison of the two manuallycreated sets of event annotations under the primarytask evaluation criteria gave an F-score of 82% forthe full task and 89% for the core task.7 We foundthat CATALYSIS events were particularly challeng-ing, showing just 65% agreement for the core task.Table 2 shows the statistics of the primary taskdata.
We note that while the corpus is broadly com-parable in size to the BioNLP?09 shared task dataset(Kim et al, 2009) in terms of the number of ab-stracts and annotated entities, the number of anno-tated events in the EPI corpus is approximately 20%of that in the ?09 dataset, reflecting the more focusedevent types.6High-confidence system predictions differing from goldannotations were provided to a human annotator, not used di-rectly to change corpus data.
To further reduce the risk of bias,we only informed the annotator of the entities involved, not ofthe predicted event structure.7Due to symmetry of precision/recall and the applied crite-ria, this score was not affected by the choice of which set ofannotations to consider as ?gold?
for the comparison.Item Training Devel TestAbstract 600 200 400Word 127,312 43,497 82,819Protein 7,595 2,499 5,096Event 1,852 601 1,261Modification 173 79 117Table 2: Statistics of the EPI corpus.
Test set statisticsshown only for the primary test data.4 EvaluationEvaluation is instance- and event-oriented and basedon the standard precision/recall/F-score8 metrics.The primary evaluation criteria are the same as in theBioNLP?09 shared task, incorporating the ?approx-imate span matching?
and ?approximate recursivematching?
variants to strict matching.
In brief, un-der these criteria text-bound annotations (event trig-gers and entities) in a submission are considered tomatch a corresponding gold annotation if their spanis contained within the (mildly extended) span ofthe gold annotation, and events that refer to otherevents as arguments are considered to match if theTheme arguments of the recursively referred eventsmatch, that is, non-Theme arguments are ignored inrecursively referred events.
For a detailed descrip-tion of these evaluation criteria, we refer to (Kim etal., 2009).In addition to the primary evaluation criteria, weintroduced a new relaxed evaluation criterion weterm single partial penalty.
Under the primary cri-teria, when a predicted event matches a gold eventin some of its arguments but lacks one or more ar-guments of the gold event, the submission is ar-guably given a double penalty: the predicted eventis counted as a false positive (FP), and the goldevent is counted as a false negative (FN).
Under thesingle partial penalty evaluation criterion, predictedevents that match a gold event in all their argumentsare not counted as FP, although the correspondinggold event still counts as FN (the ?single penalty?
).Analogously, gold events that partially match a pre-dicted event are not counted as FN, although the cor-responding predicted event with ?extra?
argumentscounts as FP.
This criterion can give a more nuancedview of performance for partially correctly predictedevents.8Specifically F1.

The EPI taskdoes not include explicit subtasks.
However, wespecifies minimal core extraction targets in additionto the full task targets.
Results are reported sepa-rately for core targets and full task, allowing partic-ipants to choose to only extract core targets.
Thefull task results are considered the primary evalua-tion for the task e.g.
for the purposes of determiningthe ranking of participating systems.5 Results5.1 ParticipationTable 3 summarizes the participating groups and thefeatures of their extraction systems.
We note that,similarly to the ?09 task, machine learning-basedsystems remain dominant overall, although there isconsiderable divergence in the specific methods ap-plied.
In addition to domain mainstays such as sup-port vector machines and maximum entropy mod-els, we find increased application of joint models(Riedel et al, 2011; McClosky et al, 2011; Riedeland McCallum, 2011) as opposed to pure pipelinesystems (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011; Quirk et al,2011) .
Remarkably, the application of full pars-ing together with dependency-based representationsof syntactic analyses is adopted by all participants,with the parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005) withthe biomedical domain model of McClosky (2009)is applied in all but one system (Liu et al, 2011) andthe Stanford Dependency representation (de Marn-effe et al, 2006) in all.
These choices may be mo-tivated in part by the success of systems using thetools in the previous shared task and the availabilityof the analyses as supporting resources (Stenetorp etal., 2011).Despite the availability of PTM and DNA methy-lation resources other than those specifically intro-duced for the task and the PHOSPHORYLATION an-notations in the GE task (Kim et al, 2011b), no par-ticipant chose to apply other corpora for training.With the exception of externally acquired unlabeleddata such as PubMed-derived word clusters appliedby three groups, the task results thus reflect a closedtask setting in which only the given data is used fortraining.5.2 Evaluation resultsTable 4 presents a the primary results by event type,and Table 5 summarizes these results.
We notethat only two teams, UTurku (Bjo?rne and Salakoski,2011) and ConcordU (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011),predicted event modifications, and only UTurku pre-dicted additional (non-core) event arguments (datanot shown).

For the full task, this differ-ence in approach is reflected in the substantial per-formance advantage for the UTurku system, whichexhibits highest performance overall as well as formost individual event types.Extraction performance for simple events tak-ing only Theme and Site arguments is consistentlyhigher than for other event types, with absolute F-score differences of over 10% points for many sys-tems.
Similar notable performance differences areseen between the addition events, for which am-ple training data was available, and the removaltypes for which data was limited.
This effect isparticularly noticeable for DEPHOSPHORYLATION,DNA DEMETHYLATION and DEMETHYLATION,for which the clear majority of systems failed to pre-dict any correct events.
Extraction performance forCATALYSIS events is very low despite a relativelylarge set of training examples, indicating that theextraction of nested event structures remains verychallenging.
This low performance may also be re-lated to the fact that CATALYSIS events are oftentriggered by the same word as the catalysed mod-ification (e.g.
Figure 1b), requiring the assignmentof multiple event labels to a single word in typicalsystem architectures.Table 6 summarizes the full task results with theaddition of the single partial penalty criterion.

These re-sults provide new perspective deserving further de-tailed study into the question of what are the mostmeaningful criteria for event extraction system eval-uation.Table 7 summarizes the core task results.
Whileall systems show notably higher performance thanfor the full task, high-ranking participants focusingon the core task gain most dramatically, with theFAUST system core task F-score essentially match-ing that of the top system (UTurku).
For the coretask, all participants achieve F-scores over 50% ?a result achieved by only a single system in the ?09task ?
and the top four participants average over 65%F-score.
These results confirm that current eventextraction technology is well applicable to the corePTM extraction task even when the number of tar-geted event types is relatively high and may be readyto address the challenges of exhaustive PTM extrac-tion (Pyysalo et al, 2011a).
The best core tasks re-sults, approaching 70% F-score, are particularly en-couraging as the level of performance is comparableto or better than state-of-the-art results for many ref-erence resources for protein-protein interaction ex-traction (see e.g.
Tikk et al (2010))) using the simpleuntyped entity pair representation, a standard taskthat has been extensively studied in the domain.6 Discussion and ConclusionsThis paper has presented the preparation, resources,results and analysis of the BioNLP Shared TaskTeam recall prec.

The results demonstrate thatthe core extraction target of identifying statementsof 14 different modification types with the modifiedgene or gene product can be reliably addressed bycurrent event extraction methods, with two systemsapproaching 70% F-score at this task.
Nevertheless,challenges remain in detecting statements regardingthe catalysis of these events as well as in resolvingthe full detail of such modification events, a task at-tempted by only one participant and at which perfor-mance remains at somewhat above 50% in F-score.Detailed evaluation showed that the highly com-petitive participating systems differ substantially intheir relative strengths, indicating potential for fur-ther development at protein and DNA modificationevent detection.
The task results are available infull detail from the shared task webpage, http://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/.In the future, we will follow the example of theBioNLP?09 shared task in making the data and re-sources of the EPI task open to all interested par-ties to encourage further study of event extractionfor epigenetics and post-translational modificationevents, to facilitate system comparison on a well-defined standard task, and to support the develop-ment of further applications of event extraction tech-nology in this important area of biomolecular sci-ence.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Yoshiro Okuda and Yo Shi-dahara of NalaPro Technologies for their efforts inproducing the EPI task annotation.
