It is a complicated problem sincetemporal expressions often have the ambiguity ofsyntactic roles.
This t)al)er discusses two problenm:(1) representing and identiflying the temporal expres-sion (2) distinguishing the syntactic tim(lion of thetemporal exI)ression in case it has a dual syntac-tic role.
In this paper, temporal expressions andthe context for disambiguation which is called localcontext are represented using lexical data extractedfiom corlms and the finite state transducer.
By ex-periments, it; turns out that the method is eflimtivefor temporal expression analysis.
In particular, oural)t)roach shows the corI)us-based work could makea promising result for the t)roblem in a restricteddomain in t, hat we can eflbctievely deal with a, largesize of lexical data.1 In t roduct ionAccurate analysis of the temporal expression is cru-cial tbr text processing aplflications uch as informa-tion extraction and for chunking for efficient syntac-tic analysis.
In information extraction, a user mightwant to get a piece of information about an event.Typically, the event is related with (late or time,,which is represented by temporal expression.Chunking is helpflfl for efficient syntactic analy-sis by removing irrelevant intermediate constituentsgenerated through parsing.
It involves the task todivide sentences into non-overlatli)ing segments.
Asa result of chunking, parsing would be a problem ofanalysis inside chunks and between chunks (Yoon, etal., 1999).
Chunking prevents the parser fl'om pro-ducing intermediate structures irrelevant o a finaloutput, which makes the parser etticient without los-ing accuracy.
Thus, it turns out that chunking is anessential stage tbr the application system like MTthat should pursue both efficiency and precision.Korean, an agglutinative language, has well-developed flmctional words such as postpositionand ending by which the grammatical fimction ofa phrase is decisively determined.
Besides, becauseit is a head final language and so the head alwaysfollows its complement, the chunking is relativelyeasy.
However, we are also faced with an mnbiguityproblem in chunking, which is often due to the tem-poral expression.
This is because inany temporalnouns are used as the modifier of noun and vert) ina sentence.
Let us consider the tbllowing examI)les:\[Example\]la  jinan(last) :l\]('oFd'll,'llt(SlllillIler)-+lbuv i - t teun(we/NOM) hamgge(together) san-c(to moun-tain) .qassda( went )\;Ve went to the mountain together last sum-Incr.j inan(last ) yeorr;um(summer) banghag-c(in va-92acation) 'uri-neun(we/NOM) hamgge(together)san-c( to mountain) gassda( went )We, went to the mountain together in the last;SUllllller Va(;atioIl.i0 weol(October) 0 il(9th)jeo'nyeo.q(evening)-+2b"7 sit7 o'clock) daetong'ryeong-yi (presi-dent/OEN) damh,'wa-ga(talk/NOM) issda(be)The president will give a talk at 7:00pro inOct.

77Ill the examples, each temporal expression plays asyntactically different role used as noun phrase oradverbial phrase (The undeJ'lined is a phrase) al-though they comprise the same phrasal fornls.
Tiletemporal expressions in la  and 2a of the exampleserve as tile temporal adverb to modify predicates.On the other hand, the temporal expressions iu lband 2b are used as the modifier of other nouns.
Thatis, as a temporal noun either contributes to construc-tion of a noun compound or modifies a predicate, it;causes a structural aml)iguity.One sohltion might be that the POS tagger as-signs a different ag to each temporal noun e.g.
NN954mid ADV'.

The temporal expression was repre-sented with loc~l grammar in his work, where it, wasclaimed that the formalism of finite automata couldbe easily used to represent them.3 Acquiring Co-occurrence ofTemporal Expression3.1 Categorizing Temporal NounsSince many words have in common a similar mean-ing and flmction, they can be categorized by theirfeatures.
So do temporal nouns.
That is, we say that'Sunday' and 'Monday' have the same features andso would take the similar behavior patterns uch asco-occurring with the similar words in a sentence orphrase.
Hence, in the frst  place we categorize tem-poral nouns according to their meaning and func-tion.
We first select 259 temporal nouns and dividethem into 26 classes as shown in Table 1.
Amongthem, some temporal words have syntactic dualityand others play one syntactic role.
Thus, the dis-ambiguation process would be applied only to thewords with dual syntactic functions.3.2 Acquisition of Temporal Expressionsf rom CorpusTemporal words would be combined with each otherin order to be made reference to time, which is calledtemporal expression.

Ill tile practical system, however, weare confronted with a complicated problenl in treat-ing teml)oral expressions since many temporal wordshave a functional ambiguity used as both a nominaland predicate modifier.
For instance, a temporalnoun oneul(today) could play a different role in thesimilar situation as shown in Figure 2.
In the firstand the second path, the words to follow oneul are allnoun, but the roles (dependency rela;ions) of onculare different.Accurate classitication of their syntactic flmctionsis crucial for the application system since great dif-ference would be made according to accuracy of thedependency result.

From the re-sult in the table we see that the method is very effec-t, ive in that it very accurately identifies all tile tem-poral expressions aim assigns them syntactic tags.And, Table 2 shows the reduction resulted fromchunking after temporal expression identification.We take into consideration the average numl)cr ofhead candidates for each word since our parser isdependency based one.
The test was conducted onthe tirst file (about 800 sentences) of KAIST tree-bank (Choict  al.
, 1994).
The number was reducedby 51% in candidates compared to the system withno chunking, whMl makes pa.rsing efficient.Most of errors were caused by tile case where tein-poral words have different syntactic roles under thesame context.
In this case, the global context such asthe whole sentence or intcrscnt;cntial infornlation orsometimes very soi)histicated processing ixneeded toresolve the prol)lem, l~br instance, '82 ~tycoTt(year)h, yco'njac-yi(now/Gl;N)' could be used two-.way.
Ifthe speech time is the year 1982, then h, yeou(fl, e-yi areconlbined with 82 nycon to represent time.
Other-wise, 82 does not ino(til~y hycordac-yi, wlfich cannotbe recognized only with the local context.
Neverthe-less, the system is promising in that generally it canilnprove e\[flciency without losing accuracy which iscrucial for the pracl;ical system.6 Conclusionshi this paper, we presented a method for identifi-cation of temporal exi)ressions and their syntacticfunctions based on FST aim lexical data extractedfl:om corpus.
Since tenlporal words have the syntac-tic ambiguity when used in a sentence, it; is impo>tant to identify the syntactic functioll as well as thetemporal expression itself.For the purpose, we manually extracted lexical c(>occurrences t?om large corpus aim it was possible asthe number of temporal nouns is tractable noughto manipulate lexical data t)y hand.
As shown intile result, lexical co-occurrences are crucial for dis-mnbiguating the syntactic flmction of the tenlporalexpression.
Besides, the finite state approach pro-vide(l an eftieient model for temporal expression pro-cessing.
Combined with the clmnker, it helped re-nmrkably lessen, by 1)runing irrelewmt candidates,intermediate structures generated while parsing.ReferencesAlmey, S. 199t.
