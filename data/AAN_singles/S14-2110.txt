Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 624?627,Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014.Team Z: Wiktionary as a L2 Writing AssistantAnubhav GuptaUFR SLHSUniversit?e de Franche-Comt?eanubhav.gupta@edu.univ-fcomte.frAbstractThis paper presents a word-for-word trans-lation approach using Wiktionary forSemEval-2014 Task 5.
The languagepairs attempted for this task were English-Spanish and English-German.
Since thisapproach did not take context into account,it performed poorly.1 IntroductionThe objective of SemEval-2014 Task 5 is to trans-late a few words or a phrase from one language(L1) into another (L2).
More specifically, a sen-tence containing primarily L2 and a few L1 wordsis provided, and the task is to translate the L1words into the L2.
This task is similar to the previ-ous cross-linguistic SemEval tasks involving lexi-cal substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010) and word-sense disambiguation (Lefever and Hoste, 2013).For example, consider the following sentence,written entirely in German except for one Englishword: Aber auf diesem Schiff wollen wir auchRuderer sein, wir sitzen im selben Boot und wollenmit Ihnen row.
Here, the word row is polysemousand can be translated as the verb rudern or as thenoun Reihe depending on context.
The words tobe translated can also form an idiomatic expres-sion, such as in exchange in die 1967 erobertenarabischen Gebiete in exchange gegen Frieden.These examples reveal that this is not a straightfor-ward task, as word-for-word translation may giveinaccurate results.Wiktionary is a multilingual dictionary con-taining word-sense, examples, sample quotations,collocations, usage notes, proverbs and transla-tions (Torsten et al., 2008; Meyer and Gurevych,2012).

However, thetranslation approach was word-for-word and ig-nored the target language (L2) context, i.e., thecontext in which the text fragment to be trans-lated is found.
The Wiktionary-based solutionis for English-to-Spanish and English-to-Germanlanguage translation though four language pairswere provided in this shared task.2 WiktionaryFor a given word, the English version of Wik-tionary gives not only its definition but also possi-ble translations.
The translations are divided basedon part of speech (PoS) and word sense and attimes also encode gender and number informa-tion.
For example, the German and Spanish trans-lations for the English word book are stored inWiktionary as follows:====Noun===={{en-noun}}=====Translations====={{trans-top|collection of sheetsof paper bound togethercontaining printed or writtenmaterial}}*German: {{t+|de|Buch|n}}*Spanish: {{t+|es|libro|m}}{{trans-top|record of betting}}*German: {{t|de|Wettliste|f}}{{trans-top|convenient collectionof small paper items, such asstamps}}*German: {{t+|de|Album|n}}*Spanish: {{t+|es|?album|m}}{{trans-top|major division ofa published work, larger than624a chapter}}{{trans-top|script of a musical}}*Spanish: {{t+|es|libreto|m}}{{trans-top|usually in plural:records of the accounts ofa business}}*German: {{t+|de|B?ucher|n-p}}{{trans-top|ebook}}*German: {{t+|de|E-Book|n}}====Verb===={{en-verb}}=====Translations====={{trans-top|to reserve}}*German: {{t+|de|buchen}},{{t+|de|reservieren}}*Spanish: {{t|es|reservar}}{{trans-top|to write down,register, record}}*German: {{t+|de|notieren}},{{t+|de|schreiben}}*Spanish: {{t+|es|anotar}}{{trans-top|to record the detailsof}}*{{ttbc|de}}: {{t+|de|bestrafen}}{{trans-top|sports: to issue witha caution}}{{trans-top|slang: to travelvery fast}}*German: {{t+|de|rasen}}*{{ttbc|es}}: {{t|es|multar}}The Wiktionary dump1is an XML file contain-ing the word in the <title> tag and its descrip-tion under the <text> tag.
The translation of theword is indicated by {{t| or {{t+| followed bytwo letters to denote the target language (es forSpanish and de for German).
This is followed bythe translation and gender information in the caseof nouns.The information in Wiktionary was convertedinto a multidimensional hash table consisting ofEnglish words as key and PoS and translations in1For this task the 17 Dec 2013 version was used.Spanish and German as the values.
This table wasused to look up the translations for the task.Wiktionary also contains lists of the 10000 mostfrequent words in Spanish and of the 2000 mostfrequent words in German.
This information wasused to sort the target language words in the hashtable in decreasing order of frequency.
The trans-lations absent from these frequency lists were keptin the hash table in the order that they were ex-tracted from Wiktionary.3 TranslationTreeTagger PoS Wiktionary PoSDT Determiner, ArticleNC, NN, NNS NounIN, TO PrepositionVB, VBG,VBZ, MD VerbRB, RBR, RP, WRB AdverbCD NumeralCC ConjunctionPP, PRP, WP PronounJJ, JJS AdjectiveTable 1: PoS MappingThe TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) was used toparse the English (L1) phrases to obtain the PoS ofeach word along with the lemma.
The PoS tags re-turned by the TreeTagger were mapped to the PoSused in Wiktionary as shown in Table 1.
The wordand its PoS were searched for in the hash table.
Ifthe translation was not found, then the lemma andits PoS were looked up.
If the lemma lookup alsofailed then the phrase was not translated.Once the L2 words were obtained for all the L1words in the phrase, the L2 words were matchedbased on the gender and number information pro-vided.
For example, for the phrase this ques-tion, Wiktionary offered este|m and esta|f asSpanish translations of this, and interrogante|mpregunta|f duda|f cuesti?on|f inc?ognita|f forquestion.
The translations were paired based ongender agreement rules (e.g.
este interrogante,where both are masculine, and esta pregunta,where both are feminine) and provided as solu-tions.3.1 Rules for English-to-Spanish TranslationWiktionary only provides translations for the cita-tion form of a word (even though other forms ex-ist in WIktionary as valid entries), which is prob-625Language Pair Dataset Approach Evaluation Accuracy Word Accuracy Recallen-esTrialWord-by-WordBest 0.278 0.372 0.876Oof 0.382 0.471 0.876Word-by-Word Best 0.340 0.434 0.844+ Rules Oof 0.444 0.535 0.844TestWord-by-WordBest 0.200 0.308 0.785Oof 0.246 0.356 0.785Word-by-Word Best 0.223 0.333 0.751+ Rules Oof 0.277 0.386 0.751en-deTrial Word-by-WordBest 0.210 0.306 0.900Oof 0.316 0.422 0.900Test Word-by-WordBest 0.218 0.293 0.851Oof 0.307 0.385 0.851Table 2: Performance of the System.lematic when translating plural nouns or conju-gated (finite) verbs.
Lack of this inflectional infor-mation degraded the overall performance of bothEnglish-to-Spanish and English-to-German trans-lations.
Two rules were included in an attempt toimprove the English-to-Spanish translations: (1)plural nouns and adjectives were formed by adding-s or -es, and (2) where a noun was preceded byan adjective in a L1 phrase, after the translation,the positions of the noun and the adjective wereswitched to respect the noun-adjective word orderthat is more commonly found in Spanish.4 Results and ConclusionsTable 2 shows the performance of the systemfor the English-to-Spanish and English-to-Germantranslations.
The approach in bold was submit-ted for evaluation.
The accuracy refers to the per-centage of the fragments that were predicted accu-rately, whereas word accuracy measures the par-tially correct solutions.
For each fragment, up to5 translations could be submitted with one consid-ered as the best answer and the rest regarded asalternatives.
The best evaluation considered onlythe best answers.
On the other hand, oof (out-of-five) evaluation considered the alternative answersto calculate the scores if the best answer was in-correct.A context-independent, word-for-word transla-tion approach to L2 Writing Assistant was pro-posed.
The mediocre performance was due tothe fact the approach was very basic.
The sys-tem can be significantly improved by using theSpanish and German versions of Wiktionary tomake up for the translations missing from theEnglish version and by considering the L2 con-text provided.
One such example in the GermanWiktionary is the {{CharakteristischeWortkombinationen}} tag, which refers tothe possible collocations.
For example, one ofthe translations of the English word exchange inGerman is Austausch, which is most often col-located with im or als.
Also, using a tool likeJWKTL2would improve the quality of informa-tion extracted from Wiktionary.ReferencesEls Lefever and V?eronique Hoste.
