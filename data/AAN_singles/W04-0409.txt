In addition tothe fairly standard set of lexicalized collocationsand multi-word expressions such as named-entities,Turkish uses a quite wide range of semi-lexicalizedand non-lexicalized collocations.
After an overviewof relevant aspects of Turkish, we present a descrip-tion of the multi-word expressions we handle.
Wethen summarize the computational setting in whichwe employ a series of components for tokenization,morphological analysis, and multi-word expressionextraction.
We finally present results from runs overa large corpus and a small gold-standard corpus.1 IntroductionMulti-word expression extraction is an importantcomponent in language processing that aims toidentify segments of input text where the syntacticstructure and the semantics of a sequence of words(possibly not contiguous) are usually not composi-tional.
Idiomatic forms, support verbs, verbs withspecific particle or pre/post-position uses, morpho-logical derivations via partial or full word duplica-tions are some examples of multi-word expressions.Further, expressions such as time-date expressionsor proper nouns which can be described with sim-ple (usually finite state) grammars, and whose inter-nal structure is of no real importance to the overallanalysis of the sentence, can also be considered un-der this heading.
Marking multi-word expressionsin text usually reduces (though not significantly)the number of actual tokens that further processingmodules use as input, although this reduction maydepend on the domain the text comes from.
It canalso reduce the multiplicative ambiguity as morpho-logical interpretations of tokens are reduced whenthey are coalesced into multi-word expressions withusually a single interpretation.Turkish presents some interesting issues for multi-word expression processing as it makes substan-tial use of support verbs with lexicalized direct oroblique objects subject to various morphologicalconstraints.
It also uses partial and full reduplica-tion of forms of various parts-of-speech, across theirwhole domain to form what we call non-lexicalizedcollocations, where it is the duplication and contrastof certain morphological patterns that signal a col-location rather than the specific root words used.In this paper, we describe a multi-word expressionprocessor for preprocessing Turkish text for vari-ous language engineering applications.
In the nextsection after a very short overview of relevant as-pects of Turkish, we present a rather comprehen-sive description of the multi-word expressions wehandle.
We then summarize the structure of themulti-word expression processor which employs aseries of components for tokenization, morpholog-ical analysis, conservative non-statistical morpho-logical disambiguation, and multi-word expressionextraction.
We finally present results from runs overa large corpus and a small gold-standard corpus.1.1 Related WorkRecent work on multi-word expression extraction,use three basic approaches: statistical, rule-based,and hybrid.
Statistical approaches require a corpusthat contains significant numbers of occurrences ofmulti-word expressions.
But even if the corpus con-sists of millions of words, usually, the frequenciesof multi-word expressions are too low for statisti-cal extraction.
Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002)indicate that ?two-thirds of verb-particle construc-tions occur at most three times in the overall corpus,meaning that any extraction method must be ableto handle extremely sparse data.?
They use a rule-based method to extract multi-word expressions inthe form of a head verb and a single obligatorypreposition employing a tagger augmented with anSecond ACL Workshop on Multiword Expressions: Integrating Processing, July 2004, pp.
64-71existing chunking system with which they first iden-tify the particle chunked and then turn back for theverb part of the construction.Piao et al (2003) employ their semantic field an-notator USAS, containing 37,000 words and a tem-plate list of 16,000 multi-word units, all constructedmanually from various resources, in order to extractmulti-word expressions.
The evaluation indicates ahigh precision (over 90%) but the estimated recall isabout 40%.
Deeper investigation on the corpus hasindicated that two-thirds of the multi-word expres-sions occur in the corpus once or twice, verifyingthe fact that the statistical methods filtering low fre-quencies would fail.Urizar et al (2000) describe a Basque terminol-ogy extraction system which covered multi-wordterm extraction as a subset.
As Basque is a highlyinflected agglutinative language like Turkish, mor-phological information is exploited to better definemulti-word patterns.
Their lemmatizer/tagger EU-SLEM, consists of a tokenizer followed by two sub-systems for the treatment of single word and multi-word expressions, and a disambiguator.
The pro-posed term extraction tool uses the tagged input asthe input of a shallow parsing phase which consistsof regular expressions representing morphosyntac-tic patterns.
The final step uses statistical measuresto eliminate incorrect candidates.The basic disadvantages of rule-based approachesare that they usually lack flexibility, and it is atime-consuming and never ending process to try tocover a high percentage of the multi-word expres-sions in a language with rules and predefined lists.The LINGO group which defines multi-word ex-pressions as ?a pain in the neck for NLP?
(Sag et al,2002), suggests hybrid approaches using rule basedapproaches to identify possible multi-word expres-sions out of a corpus and using statistical methodsto enhance the results obtained.2 Multi-word expressions in TurkishTurkish is an Ural-Altaic language, having aggluti-native word structures with productive inflectionaland derivational processes.
Most derivational phe-nomena take place within a word form, but there arecertain derivations involving partial or full redupli-cations that are best considered under the notion ofmulti-word expressions.Turkish word forms consist of morphemes concate-nated to a root morpheme or to other morphemes,much like beads on a string.
Except for a veryfew exceptional cases, the surface realizations ofthe morphemes are conditioned by various morpho-phonemic processes such as vowel harmony, voweland consonant elisions.
The morphotactics of wordforms can be quite complex when multiple deriva-tions are involved.
For instance, the derived mod-ifier sag?lamlas?t?rd?g?
?m?zdaki1 would berepresented as:2saglam+Adj?DB+Verb+Become?DB+Verb+Caus+Pos?DB+Adj+PastPart+P1sg?DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+Pnon+Loc?DB+AdjThis word starts out with an adjective root and af-ter five derivations, ends up with the final part-of-speech adjective which determines its role in thesentence.Turkish employs multi-word expressions in essen-tially four different forms:1.
Lexicalized Collocations where all compo-nents of the collocations are fixed,2.
Semi-lexicalized Collocations where somecomponents of the collocation are fixed andsome can vary via inflectional and derivationalmorphology processes and the (lexical) seman-tics of the collocation is not compositional,3.
Non-lexicalized Collocations where the collo-cation is mediated by a morphosyntactic pat-tern of duplicated and/or contrasting compo-nents ?
hence the name non-lexicalized, and4.
Multi-word Named-entities which are multi-word proper names for persons, organizations,places, etc.2.1 Lexicalized CollocationsUnder the notion of lexicalized collocations, weconsider the usual fixed multi-word expressions1Literally, ?
(the thing existing) at the time we caused (some-thing) to become strong?.
Obviously this is not a word that onewould use everyday.
Turkish words (excluding noninflectingfrequent words such as conjunctions, clitics, etc.)
found in typ-ical text average about 10 letters in length.2Please refer to the list of morphological features given inAppendix A for the semantics of some of the non-obvious sym-bols used here.whose resulting syntactic function and semanticsare not readily predictable from the structure andthe morphological properties of the constituents.Here are some examples of the multi-word expres-sions that we consider under this grouping:3 ,4(1) hi?
olmazsa?
hi?(never)+Adverbol(be)+Verb+Neg+Aor+Cond+A3sg?
hi?_olmazsa+Adverb?at least?
(literally ?if it never is?
)(2) ipe sapa gelmez?
ip(rope)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Datsap(handle)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Datgel(come)+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg?
ipe_sapa_gelmez+Adj?worthless?
(literally ?
(he) does not come to ropeand handle?
)2.2 Semi-lexicalized CollocationsMulti-word expressions that are considered underthis heading are compound and support verb forma-tions where there are two or more lexical items thelast of which is a verb or is a derivation involvinga verb.
These are formed by a lexically adjacent,direct or oblique object, and a verb, which for thepurposes of syntactic analysis, may be consideredas single lexical item: e.g., sayg dur- (literally tostand (in) respect ?
to pay respect), kafay ye- (lit-erally to eat the head ?
to get mentally deranged),etc.5 Even though the other components can them-selves be inflected, they can be assumed to be fixedfor the purposes of the collocation, and the colloca-tion assumes its morphosyntactic features from thelast verb which itself may undergo any morpholog-ical derivation or inflection process.
For instance in(3) kafay ye-?
kafa(head)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Accye(eat)+Verb...3In every group we first list the morphological features ofall the tokens, one on every line (with the glosses for the roots),and then provide the morphological features of the multi-wordconstruct and then provide glosses and literal meanings.4Please refer to the list of morphological features given inAppendix A for the semantics of some of the non-obvious sym-bols used here.5Here we just show the roots of the verb with - denoting therest of the suffixes for any inflectional and derivational markers.?
kafay_ye+Verb...?get mentally deranged?
( literally ?eat the head?
)the first part of the collocation, the accusativemarked noun kafay, is the fixed part and the partstarting with the verb ye- is the variable part whichmay be inflected and/or derived in myriads of ways.For example the following are some possible formsof the collocation:?
kafay?
yedim ?I got mentally deranged??
kafay?
yiyeceklerdi ?they were about to getmentally deranged??
kafay?
yiyenler ?those who got mentally de-ranged??
kafay?
yedigi ?the fact that (s/he) got mentallyderanged?Under certain circumstances, the ?fixed?
part mayactually vary in a rather controlled manner subjectto certain morphosyntactic constraints, as in the id-iomatic verb:(4) kafa(y) ?ek-?
kafa(head)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Acc?ek(pull)+Verb...?
kafa_?ek+Verb...?consume alcohol?
(but literally ?to pull the head?
)(5) kafalar ?ek-?
kafa+Noun+A3pl+Pnon+Acc?ek+Verb...?
kafa_?ek+Verb...?consume alcohol?
(but literally ?to pull theheads?
)where the fixed part can be in the nominative or theaccusative case, and if it is in the accusative case, itmay be marked plural, in which case the verb has tohave some kind of plural agreement (i.e., first, sec-ond or third person plural), but no possessive agree-ment markers are allowed.In their simplest forms, it is sufficient to recognizea sequence of tokens one of whose morphologi-cal analyses matches the corresponding pattern, andthen coalesce these into a single multi-word expres-sion representation.
However, some or all variantsof these and similar semi-lexicalized collocationspresent further complications brought about by therelative freeness of the constituent order in Turkish,and by the interaction of various clitics with suchcollocations.6When such multi-word expressions are coalescedinto a single morphological entity, the ambiguity inmorphological interpretation is reduced as we see inthe following example:(6) devam etti?
devam(continuation)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom*deva(therapy)+Noun+A3sg+P1sg+Nomet(make)+Verb+Pos+Past+A3sg*et(meat)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?DB+Verb+Past+A3sg?
devam_et+Verb+Pos+Past+A3sg?
(he) continued?
(literally ?made a continuation?
)Here, when this semi-lexicalized collocation is rec-ognized, other morphological interpretations of thecomponents (marked with a * above) can safely beremoved, contributing to overall morphological am-biguity reduction.2.3 Non-lexicalized CollocationsTurkish employs quite a number of non-lexicalizedcollocations where the sentential role of the collo-cation has (almost) nothing to do with the parts-of-speech and the morphological features of the indi-vidual forms involved.
Almost all of these colloca-tions involve partial or full duplications of the formsinvolved and can actually be viewed as morphologi-cal derivational processes mediated by reduplicationacross multiple tokens.The morphological feature representations of suchmulti-word expressions follow one of the patterns:1) ?
?2) ?
Z ?,3) ?
+ X ?
+ Y4) ?1 + X ?2 + Xwhere ?
is the duplicated string comprising theroot, its part-of-speech and possibly some additionalmorphological features encoded by any suffixes.
Xand Y are further duplicated or contrasted morpho-logical patterns and Z is a certain clitic token.
In6The question and the emphasis clitics which are written asseparate tokens, can occasionally intervene between the com-ponents of a semi-lexicalized collocation.
We omit the detailsof these due to space restrictions.duplications of type 4, it is possible that ?1 is dif-ferent from ?2.Below we present list of the more interesting non-lexicalized expressions along with some examplesand issues.?
When a noun appears in duplicate following thefirst pattern above, the collocation behaves like amanner adverb, modifying a verb usually to theright.
Although this pattern does not necessarilyoccur with every possible noun, it may occur withmany (countable) nouns without much of a furthersemantic restriction.
Such a sequence has to be co-alesced into a representation indicating this deriva-tional process as we see below.
(7) ev ev (?
?)?
ev(house)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nomev+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?
ev+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?DB+Adverb+By?house by house?
(literally ?house house?)?
When an adjective appears in duplicate, the col-location behaves like a manner adverb (with the se-mantics of -ly adverbs in English), modifying a verbusually to the right.
Thus such a sequence has tobe coalesced into a representation indicating thisderivational process.
(8) yava?s yava?s (?
?)?
yava?s(slow)+Adjyava?s+Adj?
yava?s+Adj?DB+Adverb+Ly?slowly?
(literally ?slow slow?
)This kind of duplication can also occur when theadjective is a derived adjective as in(9) hzl hzl (?
?)?
hz(speed)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?DB+Adj+Withhz+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?DB+Adj+With?
hz+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom?DB+Adj+With?DB+Adverb+Ly?rapidly?
(literally ?with-speed with-speed?)?
Turkish has a fairly large set of onomatopoeicwords which always appear in duplicate and func-tion as manner adverbs.
The words by themselveshave no other usage and literal meaning, and mildlyresemble sounds produced by natural or artificialobjects.
In these cases, the root word almost al-ways is reduplicated but need not be, but both wordsshould be of the part-of-speech category +Dup thatwe use to mark such roots.
(10) harl hurul (?1 + X ?2 + X )?
harl+Duphurul+Dup?
harl_hurul+Adverb+Resemble?making rough noises?
(no literal meaning)?
Duplicated verbs with optative mood and thirdperson singular agreement function as manner ad-verbs, indicating that another verb is executed in amanner indicated by the duplicated verb:(11) ko?sa ko?sa (?
?)?
ko?s(run)+Verb+Pos+Opt+A3sgko?s(run)+Verb+Pos+Opt+A3sg?
ko?s+Verb+Pos+?DB+Adverb+ByDoingSo?by running?
(literally ?let him run let him run?)?
Duplicated verbs in aorist mood with third personagreement and first positive then negative polarity,function as temporal adverbs with the semantics ?assoon as one has verbed?
(12) uyur uyumaz (?
+ X ?
+ Y )?
uyu+Verb+Pos+Aor+A3sguyu+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg?
uyu+Verb+Pos+?DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs?as soon as (he) sleeps?
( literally ?
(he) sleeps (he)does not sleep?
)It should be noted that for most of the non-lexicalized collocations involving verbs (like (11)and (12) above), the verbal portion before the in-flectional marking mood can have additional deriva-tional markers and all such markers have to dupli-cate.
(13) saglamla?strr saglamla?strmaz (?+X ?+Y )?
saglam+Adj?DB+Verb+Become?DB+Verb+Caus?DB+Verb+Pos+Aor+A3sgsaglam+Adj?DB+Verb+Become?DB+Verb+Caus?DB+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg?
saglam+Adj?DB+Verb+Become+?DB+Verb+Caus+Pos?DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs?as soon as (he) fortifies (causes to become strong)?Another interesting point is that non-lexicalized col-locations can interact with semi-lexicalized collo-cations since they both usually involve verbs.
Forinstance, when the verb of the semi-lexicalized col-location example in (5) is duplicated in the form ofthe non-lexicalized collocation in (12), we get(14) kafalar?
?eker ?ekmezIn this case, first the non-lexicalized collocation hasto be coalesced into(15) kafalar?
?ek+Verb+Pos?DB+Adverb+AsSoonAsand then the semi-lexicalized collocation kicks in,to give(16) kafa_?ek+Verb+Pos?DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs(?as soon as (we/you/they) get drunk?
)Finally, the following non-lexicalized collocationinvolving adjectival forms involving duplication anda question clitic is an example of the last type ofnon-lexicalized collocation.
(17) g?zel mi g?zel (?
Z ?)?
g?zel+Adjmi+Quesg?zel+Adj?
g?zel+Adj+Very?very beautiful?
(literally ?beautiful (is it?)
beauti-ful?
)2.4 Named-entitiesAnother class of multi-word expressions that weprocess is the class of multi-word named-entitiesdenoting persons, organizations and locations.
Weessentially treat these just like the semi-lexicalizedcollocation discussed earlier, in that, when suchnamed-entities are used in text, all but the last com-ponent are fixed and the last component will usuallyundergo certain morphological processes demandedby the syntactic context as inFigure 1: The architecture of the multi-word expres-sion extraction processor(18) T?rkiye B?y?k Millet Meclisi?nde ....7Here, the last component is case marked and thisrepresents a case marking on the whole named-entity.
We package this as(19) T?rkiye_B?y?k_Millet_Meclisi+Noun+Prop+A3sg+Pnon+LocTo recognize these named entities we use a rathersimple approach employing a rather extensivedatabase of person, organization and place names,developed in the context of a previous project, in-stead of using a more sophisticated named-entityextraction scheme.3 The Structure of the Multi-wordExpression ProcessorOur multi-word expression processor is a multi-stage system as depicted in Figure 1.
The firstcomponent is a standard tokenizer which splits in-put text into constituent tokens.
These then go into7In the Turkish Grand National Assembly.a wide-coverage morphological analyzer (Oflazer,1994) implemented using Xerox finite state technol-ogy (Karttunen et al, 1997), which generates, for alltokens, all possible morphological analyses.
Thismodule also performs unknown processing by pos-tulating possible noun roots and then trying to parsethe rest of a word as a sequence of possible Turk-ish suffixes.
The morphological analysis stage alsoperforms a very conservative non-statistical mor-phological disambiguation to remove some very un-likely parses based on unambiguous contexts.
Fig-ure 2 shows a sample Turkish text that comes out ofmorphological processing, about to go into multi-word expression extraction.Kistin kist+Noun+A3sg+P2sg+Nomkist+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Gensaglgm saglk+Noun+A3sg+P1sg+Accsag+Adj?DB+Noun+Ness+A3sg+P1sg+Accskntya sknt+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Datsokacak sok+Verb+Pos+Fut+A3sgsok+Verb+Pos?DB+Adj+FutPart+Pnonherhangi herhangi+Adjbir bir+Detbir+Num+Cardbir+Adjbir+Adverbetkisi etki+Noun+A3sg+P3sg+Noms?z s?z+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nomkonusu konu+Noun+A3sg+P3sg+Nomdegil deg+Verb?DB+Verb+Pass+Pos+Imp+A2sgdegil+Conjdegil+Verb+Pres+A3sg.
.+PuncFigure 2: Output of the morphological analyzerThe multi-word expression extraction processor hasthree stages with the output of one stage feeding intothe next stage:1.
The first stage handles lexicalized collocationsand multi-word named entities.2.
The second stage handles non-lexicalized col-locations.3.
The third stage handles semi-lexicalized col-locations.
The reason semi-lexicalized collo-cations are handled last, is that any duplicateverb formations have to be processed beforecompound verbs are combined with their lexi-calized complements (cf.

Once such rules were extracted, we testedour processor on this corpus, and on a small corpusof about 4200 words to measure precision and re-call.

When we consider all classesexcept named-entities, we have a recall of 60.1%and a precision of 100%.
An analysis of the er-rors and missed multi-word expressions indicatesthat the test corpus had a certain variant of a com-pound verb construction that we had failed to ex-tract from the larger corpus we used for compil-ing rules.
Failing to extract the multi-word expres-sions for that compound verb accounted for mostof the drop in recall.
Since we are currently usinga rather naive named-entity extraction scheme,9 re-8Since this is a very large corpus, we have no easy way ofobtaining accurate precision and recall figures.9As opposed to a general purpose statistical NE extractorthat we have developed earlier (T?r et al, 2003).call is rather low as there are quite a number of for-eign multi-word named-entities (persons and orga-nizations mostly) that do not exist in our databaseof named-entities.
On the other hand, since named-entity extraction for English is a relatively maturetechnology, we can easily integrate an existing toolto improve our recall.5 ConclusionsThis paper has described a multi-word expressionextraction system for Turkish for handling vari-ous types of multi-word expressions such as semi-lexicalized and non-lexicalized collocations whichdepend on the recognition of certain morphologi-cal patterns across tokens.
Our results indicate thatwith about 1100 rules (most of which were extractedfrom a large ?training corpus?
searching for patternsinvolving a certain small set of support verbs), wewere able get alost 100% precision and around60% recall on a small ?test?
corpus.
We expect thatwith additional rules from dictionaries and othersources we will improve recall significantly.6 AcknowledgmentsWe thank Orhan Bilgin for helping us compile themulti-word expressions.ReferencesTimothy Baldwin and Aline Villavicencio.
