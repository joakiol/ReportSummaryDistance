Institut AJoachim H.LaubschInstitut f. InformatikUniversitaet StuttgartD-7ooo StuttgartWest GermanyThe paper discusses the role of argumentation schemata andtheir interaction with other knowledge sources within acomputer model for in-depth understanding of newspapertexts about jobmarket developments.
Some of these schemataare presented; the "ALTHOUGH ..."-argumentation (German:"TROTZ ...") and its formalization are discussed indetail.1.
IntroductionReading newspapers may be seen as an "everyday cognitive task".
Therefore it isnot astonishing that some work in Artificial Intelligence aims at the simulationof aspects of the understanding processes of newspaper readers \[Eisenstadt 1977;Rosenberg 1977\].
There have even been pioneering system~: the Script ~0plierMechanism \[Cullingford 1978\] demonstrated careful reading of "event~--oriented newsstories about earthquakes, vehicle accidents, plane crashes and so on, whereasFRUMP \[DeJong 1979\] si~Jlated skimming abilities using texts about the samethemes.We are working with texts about jobmarket developments taken from West Germannewspapers \[Laubsch&Roesner 1980\].
An important aspect of our texts is that theydeal with argtm~ntations about reported data and their respective changes.
In thispaper we describe our (not yet implemented) conceptual approach for processingsuch structures.2.
Understanding ar~nentstionIn our view, argtm~ntation schemata in general work on a kind of "theory" of thedomain of discourse, i.e.
on a structure that encodes knowledge about domain-specific dependencies.
We use a dependency-network in order to represent theaverage reader's expertise and qualitative reasonin@ ability about the jobmarket.Our representation is influenced by ideas from \[Sussman&Steele 1980\].In some sense, one may interpret an argtm~ntation schema as a function that takespropositions (<PROP>s) as arguments.
In case of coherent or correct use, thesepropositions have to fulfill certain constraints that are defined with reference_ to the "theory" of the specific domain of discourse.Thus, wundersta~ir~" ~tat i (m~ in terms of these schemata can be seen asestablishing the constraint relations between given propositions by an inferencemechanism that operates on the dependency net of the domain.
This always involvestesting on discourse coherence (if it is assumed to have a correct "theory")and/or checking the "theory" (if it is assumed to have correct texts).325326 D.F.

Explanation schemataExplanation schemata deal with reasons - in cur domain these are mostly reasonsfor the jobmarket fluctuations under discussion.
Although we use German surface-oriented labels (which we transcribe into ~glish), we are discussing all of thefollowing examples as deep structures that may be underlying to diverse surfaceconstructs.~ i >  <PR~a-2>': (~-OF  <PROP-l> <PROP-2>)This is a general explanation schema.
If used correctly, then <PRUP-I> givesreason(s) for <PROP-2> : If <PROP-l> is a "simple" fact in our theory, then theremust be an inference path in the dependency net alng cause-effect links leadingfrom <PROP-l> to <PROP-2>.
If <PROP-I> is a conjunction of two (or more) "simple"facts, then inference paths starting from those points must interfere in such away that they finally lead to <PRDP-2>.Among German surface triggers for the BECAUSE-OF-schema are: "WEGEN ...", "WL "...", "DA ...", "DURCH ...", "AUFCAqD%D %~N ...", "INFDLGE DES ...", but also moreelaborate ones like " ... DARAUF ~ E N  DASS ..." or "... DAMIT ~ E NDASS "<PROP>': (MOREOVER <PROP>)This schema may be used if we are discussing a complex situation whereconsequences of several factors interfere and where the already mentioned (orderived) propositions are not sufficient to explain a given result.
<PROP> mustsatisfy the constraint that it gives additional supportive reason for anunexplained effect, i.e.
<PROP> opens a new inference-path in the dependency netsuch that interference with previous i~ le te  paths is possible in a way whichfinally produces the explanation that is searched for.<PR~*-I> <PR~*-2>': (ALTH0\[K~ <PROP-l> <PROP-2>)This sch~na deals with expectations and their non-fulfillment.
Other surfacemanifestations are constructs like "O~90HL <PROP-l> <PROP-2>", "UNGEACHTET <PROP-i> <PR0P-2>" or "ZWAR <PROP-l> D~k%X3CR <PROP-2>".The relation between <PROP-l> and <PROP-2> in an ALTB0t~H-schema involves a thirdproposition <PROP-2'>, whose constraints are:a) <PROP-2'> is in a contradictive relation (e.g.
negation) to <PROP-2>b) <PROP-2'> could be expected as a (default) conm ~uence of <PROP-l> (or inother words: (BECAUSE-OF <PROP-l> <PROP-2'>) could be verified).In coherent texts the contradiction between expected and actual development givenwith an ALTH0t~R-schema will demand further explanation.
~0~@exsta~ing"~ l a m a t / c m  thus involves answering the following questions:AI: ~lat was the unfulfilled expectation <PROP-2'> contrary to <PROP-2>?I%2: Why did the expectstion~s) <PROP-2'> fail?A3: ~at  caused the fact(s) of <PROP-2> to happen?Until we cannot sufficiently re=.x)Ive these explanation tasks, the ALTH0t~B-sche~awill keep active and guide the processing of further input.4.
A detailed exampleIn order to clarify our _approach, let us trace the processing of the flow ofargumentation in an actual newspaper article (taken from "StbttgarterNachrichten", March 7, 1979).ARGUMENTATION STRUCTURES IN NEWSPAPER TEXTS 327S~_= TRDTZ DES ANHALT~-NDEN ~ IST IN DER BUNDESREPUBLI K DIEAK~EITSLOS~ZAHL IM FEBRUAR LEICHT Z~KG~GANGEN.
(Englo : In spite of continuingwinter weather the numbe~ of une~@loyed in the FRG decreased slightly infebruary.
)Input to the inference machine is vmitten in a surface-oriented frame notation(~-~hich could e.g.
be produced by a semantic ATN-grammar).

)The first step in processing AL~THOL~JH-I is to construct PROP-2' as a negation ofPROP-2.In this case, the "subject" of PIRDP-2 is "CHANGE-I N R - ~  (IN ~ FIRG INFEBRUARY ..)", whereas the "predicate" is the filler of the VALUE-slot, i?eoSLIGHT-DECREASE.
The procedure for generating a candidate PROP-2' preserves the"subject", but negates the "predicate".What is the negation of a SLIGHT-DBCREASE?
For pur~s  of qualitative reasoning,we take VALUEs for CHANGEs frcm a five point scale from "++" (~- INCRFASE)  to"~"  (~-DECRFASE) ,  i.e.
"-~ corresponds to SLIGHT-DECREASE.
Interpretingnegation of SLIGHT-DECREASE as simply taking the complement of {-} with respect tot/~e set of all VALUES = {++, +, 0, -, --} would yield I~-DECREASE L%ICHANGI~)SL IO}Ff -~ ~- INCREASE\ ] ,  but a constraint for surface constructs allows usto exclu61e IARGE-DECI%EASE in this case.If a larger value had been expected (and not the opposite direction of change),then this would have been indicated by a modifier like "NUR" (EngI.
"ONLY") as in:TIIOTZ DER S A I ~ E  IM OK"rOBER STIES DIE ARBEIT~LOSEN~ IN DEM MZX~IAT NUR IIM0oi AUF 3.3 PROZENT AN (from "Stuttgarter Nachrichten", Nov. 7, 1979).
