Users may make errors when theyare typing in Chinese words.
In this paper, weare concerned with the reasons that cause theerrors.
Inspired by the observation that press-ing backspace is one of the most common us-er behaviors to modify the errors, we collect54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a real-world data set that contains 2, 277, 786 user-s via backspace operations.
In addition, wepresent a comparative analysis of the data toachieve a better understanding of users?
inputbehaviors.
Comparisons with English typossuggest that some language-specific propertiesresult in a part of Chinese input errors.1 IntroductionUnlike western languages, Chinese is unique dueto its logographic writing system.
Chinese userscannot directly type in Chinese words using a QW-ERTY keyboard.
Pinyin is the official system totranscribe Chinese characters into the Latin alpha-bet.
Based on this transcription system, Pinyin inputmethods have been proposed to assist users to typein Chinese words (Chen, 1997).The typical way to type in Chinese words isin a sequential manner (Wang et al, 2001).
As-sume users want to type in the Chinese word ???(what)?.
First, they mentally generate and typein corresponding Pinyin ?shenme?.
Then, a ChinesePinyin input method displays a list of Chinese wordswhich share that Pinyin, as shown in Fig.
1.
UsersFigure 1: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for acorrect Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin).Figure 2: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for amistyped Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin).visually search the target word from candidates andselect numeric key ?1?
to get the result.
The last t-wo steps do not exist in typing process of Englishwords, which indicates that it is more complicatedfor Chinese users to type in Chinese words.Chinese users may make errors when they are typ-ing in Chinese words.
As shown in Fig.
2, a usermay mistype ?shenme?
as ?shenem?.
Typical Chi-nese Pinyin input method can not return the rightword.
Users may not realize that an error occurs andselect the first candidate word ?????
(a mean-ingless word) as the result.
This greatly limits us-er experience since users have to identify errors andmodify them, or cannot get the right word.In this paper, we analyze the reasons that causeerrors in Chinese Pinyin input method.
This analy-sis is helpful in enhancing the user experience andthe performance of Chinese Pinyin input method.
Inpractice, users press backspace on the keyboard tomodify the errors, they delete the mistyped word andre-type in the correct word.
Motivated by this ob-485servation, we can extract error-correction pairs frombackspace operations.
These error-correction pairsare of great importance in Chinese spelling correc-tion task which generally relies on sets of confusingwords.We extract 54, 309, 334 error-correction pairsfrom user input behaviors and further study them.Our comparative analysis of Chinese and English ty-pos suggests that some language-specific propertiesof Chinese lead to a part of input errors.
To the bestof our knowledge, this paper is the first one whichanalyzes user input behaviors in Chinese Pinyin in-put method.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 discusses related works.
Section 3 intro-duces how we collect errors in Chinese Pinyin inputmethod.
In Section 4, we investigate the reasons thatresult in these errors.
Section 5 concludes the wholepaper and discusses future work.2 Previous WorkFor English spelling correction (Kukich, 1992;Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005; Chen et al, 2007;Whitelaw et al, 2009; Gao et al, 2010), most ap-proaches make use of a lexicon which contains a listof well-spelled words (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005;Islam and Inkpen, 2009).
Context features (Ro-zovskaya and Roth, 2010) of words provide usefulevidences for spelling correction.
These featuresare usually represented by an n-gram language mod-el (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Wilcox-O?Hearn etal., 2010).
Phonetic features (Toutanova and Moore,2002; Atkinson, 2008) are proved to be useful in En-glish spelling correction.
A spelling correction sys-tem is trained using these features by a noisy channelmodel (Kernighan et al, 1990; Ristad et al, 1998;Brill and Moore, 2000).Chang (1994) first proposes a representative ap-proach for Chinese spelling correction, which re-lies on sets of confusing characters.
Zhang et al(2000) propose an approximate word-matching al-gorithm for Chinese to solve Chinese spell detec-tion and correction task.
Zhang et al (1999) presenta winnow-based approach for Chinese spelling cor-rection which takes both local language features andwide-scope semantic features into account.
Lin andYu (2004) use Chinese frequent strings and reportan accuracy of 87.32%.
Liu et al (2009) show thatabout 80% of the errors are related to pronunciation-s.
Visual and phonological features are used in Chi-nese spelling correction (Liu et al, 2010).Instead of proposing a method for spelling cor-rection, we mainly investigate the reasons that causetyping errors in both English and Chinese.
Someerrors are caused by specific properties in Chinesesuch as the phonetic difference between Mandarinand dialects spoken in southern China.
Meanwhile,confusion sets of Chinese words play an importan-t role in Chinese spelling correction.
We extract alarge scale of error-correction pairs from real userinput behaviors.
These pairs contain important ev-idence about confusing Pinyins and Chinese wordswhich are helpful in Chinese spelling correction.3 User Input Behaviors AnalysisWe analyze user input behaviors from anonymoususer typing records in a Chinese input method.
Dataset used in this paper is extracted from Sogou Chi-nese Pinyin input method1.
It contains 2, 277, 786users?
typing records in 15 days.
The numbers ofChinese words and characters are 3, 042, 637, 537and 5, 083, 231, 392, respectively.
We show someuser typing records in Fig.

WINWORD.exeFigure 3: Backspace in user typing records.From Fig.
3, we can see the typing process of aChinese sentence ??????
(What is this).
Eachline represents an input segment or a backspace op-eration.
For example, word ????
(what) is type-d in using Pinyin ?shenme?
with numeric selection?1?
at 11:10am in Microsoft Word application.The user made a mistake to type in the thirdPinyin (?shenme?
is mistyped as ?shenem?).
Then,he/she pressed the backspace to modify the errorshe has made.
the word ?????
is deleted and re-placed with the correct word ????
using Pinyin1Sogou Chinese Pinyin input method, can be accessed fromhttp://pinyin.sogou.com/486?shenme?.
As a result, we compare the typed-in Pinyins before and after backspace operations.We can find the Pinyin-correction pairs ?shenem-shenme?, since their edit distance is less than athreshold.
Threshold is set to 2 in this paper, asDamerau (1964) shows that about 80% of typos arecaused by a single edit operation.
Therefore, using athreshold of 2, we should be able to find most of thetypos.
Furthermore, we can extract correspondingChinese word-correction pairs ????-???
fromthis typing record.Using heuristic rules discussed above, we extrac-t 54, 309, 334 Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs.
We list some examples of extractedPinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairsin Table 1.

(return)Table 1: Typical Pinyin-correction and Chineseword-correction pairs.We want to evaluate the precision and recall ofour extraction method.
For precision aspect, we ran-domly select 1, 000 pairs and ask five native speak-ers to annotate them as correct or wrong.
Annota-tion results show that the precision of our method isabout 75.8%.
Some correct Pinyins are labeled aserrors because we only take edit distance into con-sideration.
We should consider context features aswell, which will be left as our future work.We choose 15 typical mistyped Pinyins to evalu-ate the recall of our method.
The total occurrencesof these mistyped Pinyins are 259, 051.
We success-fully retrieve 144, 020 of them, which indicates therecall of our method is about 55.6%.
Some errorsare not found because sometimes users do not modi-fy the errors, especially when they are using Chineseinput method under instant messenger softwares.4 Comparisons of Pinyin typos andEnglish TyposIn this section, we compare the Pinyin typos and En-glish typos.
As shown in (Cooper, 1983), typing er-rors can be classified into four categories: deletions,insertions, substitutions, and transpositions.
We aimat studying the reasons that result in these four kindsof typing errors in Chinese Pinyin and English, re-spectively.For English typos, we generate mistyped word-correction pairs from Wikipedia2 and SpellGood.3,which contain 4, 206 and 10, 084 common mis-spellings in English, respectively.
As shown in Ta-ble 2, we reach the first conclusion: about halfof the typing errors in Pinyin and English arecaused by deletions, which indicates that users aremore possible to omit some letters than other threeedit operations.Deletions Insertions Substitutions TranspositionsPinyin 47.06% 28.17% 19.04% 7.46%English 43.38% 18.89% 17.32% 18.70%Table 2: Different errors in Pinyin and English.Table 3 and Table 4 list Top 5 letters that producedeletion errors (users forget to type in some letters)and insertion errors (users type in extra letters) inPinyin and English.Pinyin Examples English Examplesi xianza-xianzai e achive-achieveg yingai-yinggai i abilties-abilitiese shenm-shenme c acomplish-accomplishu pengyo-pengyou a agin-againh senme-shenme t admited-admittedTable 3: Deletion errors in Pinyin and English.Pinyin Examples English Examplesg yingwei-yinwei e analogeous-analogousi tiebie-tebie r arround-arounda xiahuan-xihuan s asside-asideo huijiao-huijia i aisian-asianh shuibian-suibian n abandonned-abandonedTable 4: Insertion errors in Pinyin and English.2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines3http://www.spellgood.net/487We can see from Table 3 and Table 4 that: (1)vowels (a, o, e, i, u) are deleted or inserted more fre-quently than consonants in Pinyin.
(2) some specificproperties in Chinese lead to insertion and deletionerrors.
Many users in southern China cannot dis-tinguish the front and the back nasal sound (?ang?
-?an?, ?ing?
- ?in?, ?eng?
- ?en?)
as well as the retroflexand the blade-alveolar (?zh?
- ?z?, ?sh?
- ?s?, ?ch?
-?c?).
They are confused about whether they shouldadd letter ?g?
or ?h?
under these situations.
(3) thesame letters can occur continuously in English, suchas ?acomplish-accomplish?
and ?admited-admitted?in our examples.
English users sometimes make in-sertion or deletion errors in these cases.
We alsoobserve this kind of errors in Chinese Pinyin, suchas ?yingai-yinggai?, ?liange-liangge?
and ?dianao-diannao?.For transposition errors, Table 5 lists Top 10 pat-terns that produce transposition errors in Pinyin andEnglish.
Our running example ?shenem-shenme?belongs to this kind of errors.
We classify the let-ters of the keyboard into two categories, i.e.
?left?and ?right?, according to their positions on the key-board.
Letter ?e?
is controlled by left hand while ?m?is controlled by right hand.
Users mistype ?shenme?as ?shenem?
because they mistake the typing orderof ?m?
and ?e?.Fig.
4 is a graphic representation, in which we adda link between ?m?
and ?e?.
The rest patterns in Ta-ble 5 can be done in the same manner.
Interestingly,from Fig.
4, we reach the second conclusion: mostof the transposition errors are caused by mistak-ing the typing orders across left and right hands.For instance, users intend to type in a letter (?m?
)controlled by right hand.
But they type in a letter(?e?)
controlled by left hand instead.Pinyin Examples English Examplesai xaing-xiang ei acheive-achievena xinag-xiang ra clera-clearem shenem-shenme re vrey-veryia xianzia-xianzai na wnat-wantne zneme-zenme ie hieght-heightoa zhidoa-zhidao er befoer-beforeei jiejei-jiejie it esitmated-estimatedhs haihsi-haishi ne scinece-scienceah sahng-shang el littel-littleou rugou-ruguo si epsiode-episodeTable 5: Transpositions errors in Pinyin and English.Letters Controlledby Left HandLetters Controlledby Right Handr aestinmohluFigure 4: Transpositions errors on the keyboard.For substitution errors, we study the reason whyusers mistype one letter for another.
In the Pinyin-correction pairs, users always mistype ?a?
as ?e?
andvice versa.
The reason is that they have similar pro-nunciations in Chinese.
As a result, we add two di-rected edges ?a?
and ?e?
in Fig.
5.
Some letters aremistyped for each other because they are adjacenton the keyboard although they do not share similarpronunciations, such as ?g?
and ?f?.We summarize the substitution errors in Englishin Fig.
6. Letters ?q?, ?k?
and ?c?
are often mixed upwith each other because they sound alike in Englishalthough they are apart on the keyboard.
However,the three letters are not connected in Fig.
5, whichindicates that users can easily distinguish them inPinyin.Figure 5: Substitutions errors in Pinyin.488Figure 6: Substitutions errors in English.MistypedletterpairsSimilarpronunciationsin ChineseSimilarpronunciationsin EnglishAdjacentonkeyboard(m,n) X X X(b,p);(d,t) X X ?

XTable 6: Pronunciation properties and keyboard dis-tance in Chinese Pinyin and EnglishWe list some examples in Table 6.
For example,letters ?m?
and ?n?
have similar pronunciations inboth Chinese and English.
Moreover, they are adja-cent on the keyboard, which leads to interferences orconfusion in both Chinese and English.
Letters ?j?,?q?
and ?x?
are far from each other on the keyboard.But they sound alike in Chinese, which makes themconnected in Fig.
5.
In Fig.
6, letters ?b?
and ?p?are connected to each other because they have simi-lar pronunciations in English, although they are notadjacent on the keyboard.Finally, we summarize the third conclusion: sub-stitution errors are caused by language specificsimilarities (similar pronunciations) or keyboardneighborhood (adjacent on the keyboard).All in all, we generally classify typing errors inEnglish and Chinese into four categories and investi-gate the reasons that result in these errors respective-ly.
Some language specific properties, such as pro-nunciations in English and Chinese, lead to substitu-tion, insertion and deletion errors.
Keyboard layoutsplay an important role in transposition errors, whichare language-independent.5 Conclusions and Future WorksIn this paper, we study user input behaviors in Chi-nese Pinyin input method from backspace opera-tions.
We aim at analyzing the reasons that causethese errors.
Users signal that they are very likelyto make errors if they press backspace on the key-board.
Then they modify the errors and type in thecorrect words they want.
Different from the previousresearch, we extract abundant Pinyin-correction andChinese word-correction pairs from backspace op-erations.
Compared with English typos, we observesome language-specific properties in Chinese haveimpact on errors.
All in all, user behaviors (Zhenget al, 2009; Zheng et al, 2010; Zheng et al, 2011b)in Chinese Pinyin input method provide novel per-spectives for natural language processing tasks.Below we sketch three possible directions for thefuture work: (1) we should consider position fea-tures in analyzing Pinyin errors.
For example, it isless likely that users make errors in the first letterof an input Pinyin.
(2) we aim at designing a self-adaptive input method that provide error-tolerantfeatures (Chen and Lee, 2000; Zheng et al, 2011a).
(3) we want to build a Chinese spelling correctionsystem based on extracted error-correction pairs.AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by a Tsinghua-Sogou join-t research project and the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China under Grant No.
