Generating Interlanguage Syllabification in Optimality Theory"Hyouk-Keun KimDepartment of LinguisticsGeorgetown University37 th & O St. NW, Washington, DC 20057, USAkimhk@epsilon3.georgetown.eduAbst ractThis paper proposes an Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky, 1993) \[OT\]-based generator of theInterlanguage \[IL\] I syllabification of Korean speakers of English.
Basically, I accept he ideas of 'cyclicCON-EVAL loop' and 'locally encoded finite candidate set' proposed by Hammond (1995, 1997b).However, in order to treat some features of Korean accented English such as vowel epenthesis,segment modification (stop voicing, devoicing, nasalization, etc.
), and ambisyllabicity, I suppose thatthe input string of phonemes be linked to two templates of candidate grid sets; one for syllableposition, and the other for (finite) possible output segments for each input segment.
I will also use theALIGN family of constraints o treat he Korean coda neutralization phenomena effectively.1.
IntroductionIn a second language acquisition, one of the mostimportant factors in learner errors is first languagetransfer (Kenworthy, 1987; Major, 1994).
ManyKorean speakers, for example, mispronounce 'pickme up' as \[phi!lmi^p\] (stop nasalization) and 'stopit' as \[swtha_bit\] (vowel epenthesis and voicelessstop voicing), since they tend to transfer Koreanphonology to their English IL.Ellison (1994), Tesar (1995), Eisner (1997),Hammond (1995, 1997b), etc.
propose how toimplement OT.
However, their implementation isusually based on basic syllable structureconstraints such as *PEAK/C, *MARGIN/V,PARSE, FILL, ONSET, NoCoda, *COMPLEX, etc.Accordingly, it is hard for such implementationto cover the syllabification of real language dataproperly, since most languages including IL ofKorean learners of English are not simple enoughto be governed by only such constraints.In the next section, I will present he salientfeatures of Korean phonology and IL phonologyof Korean speakers of English \[IL-K-E\] in termsof OT.
In Section 3, I will propose how toimplement an OT-based generator of IL-K-E. InSections 4, I will mention contribution and futurework of this project.
Section 5 is the conclusion.
* The generator in this paper is a subsystem of my Korean Accented English Pronunciation Simulator\[KAEPS\] system, which is part of the Ph.D. dissertation I am writing.
The KAEPS system is implemented in PERLand deals with pronunciation not only of word-level but also of phrase-level English orthographic representations.The output of the KAEPS is three types of English pronunciations: 1)a phoneme-based English pronunciation, 2)adesirable allophone-based English pronunciation, and 3) one or some possible Korean accented Englishpronunciation(s).
It is run on the Web and its URL is http://epsilon3.georgetown.edu/~kimhk/cgi-bin/kaepsL I amgrateful to Lisa Zsiga and an anonymous reader for their comments on an earlier version of this paper, and to CathyBall and Donna Lardiere for their help and encouragement which aided me in accomplishing this project, and alsoto Michael Hammond for allowing me to try to revise his parser (1995) in order to make it compatible with myKAEPS system.
Of course, all errors or mistakes in this paper are mine,\] Selinker (1969, 1972) proposed and elaborated the term "interlanguage" toexplain the unique utterance ofL2 learners.
It is regarded as a separate linguistic system which results from a learner's attempts o produce a targetlanguage norm.12.
IL Phonology of Korean Speakers ofEngl ish  \ [ IL -K-E\]Korean has three distinctive types of voicelessstops as phonemes: aspirated/ph, t h, kn/, fortis/p*,t*, k*/, and lenis /p, t, k/.
Voiced stops do notexist as phonemes but exist as allophones,because lenis stops become voiced between two(voiced) sonorant sounds.
Thus, unlike English,aspiration is a phonemic feature and voicing instops is an allophonic one in Korean.
ManyKoreans tend to accept English voiceless tops asKorean aspirated stops, so they pronounce schoolas \[stukhul\].
In this project, the input of an Englishvoiceless top is regarded as an aspirated stop.There are three salient features of Koreansyllable structure.
First, consonant clusters are notallowed.
When speaking an English word withconsonant clusters, many Koreans tend to insert avowel as shown below:(1) a. school \[sw.khul\]b. mint \[rain.thin\]In English, *COM should be lower-ranked thanMAX or DEP.In IL-K-E, vowel epenthesis occurs not onlyin consonant clusters but also in syllable-finalfricatives or affricates or even stops preceded bya diphthong (Ahn, 1991; H-B Park, 1992;Broselow & H-B Park, 1995; Tak, 1996) asshown below:(6) a. kiss \[kais_m_\]b. push \[p~uJ'_i\]c. tight \[thaithw\].This is related to the second feature of Koreansyllable structure that only seven consonants \[p, t,k, m, n, q, 11 can occur in the coda position inKorean.
Labial and velar stops are neutralized asa homorganic lenis stop (/ph, p.,  p/ ~ \[p\]; /k h,k*, k/ ~ \[k\]), and all coronal obstruents as \[t\](It h, t*, t, t~ h, ~*, t~, s, s* /~ \[t\]).
To deal with thiscoda neutralization phenomenon, I propose thefollowing Feature Alignment Constraints,revising Hong (1997): 2Let us see how such IL pronunciation is obtainedin terms of OT.
First of all, the following OTconstraints are to be considered:(2) *.
'_COMPLEX \[*COMI (P&S)No more than one C or V may associateto any syllable position node.
(3) MAX (McCarthy, 1995a)Every element of S 1 has a correspondentin $2.
(no deletion of a segment)(7) a. Align-Left (\[stiff vocal folds\], or)~\[A-L(svf, or)\]b. Align-Left (\[+continuant\], ~)\[A-L(cont, cr)\]These constraints force a segment with thecorresponding feature in the syllable-initialposition.
Like Hong, I also adopt IDENT-IO IF\]constraints, which also belong to theCorrespondence Theory family.
(4) DEP (McCarthy, 1995a)Every element of $2 has a correspondentin S 1.
(no insertion of a segment)The constraint ranking seems to be {*COM,MAX} >> DEP as depicted in (5):(5) mint/mintn/minmint hmin.thtu*COM MAX DEP*!
*!2 Adopting McCarthy & Prince's (1993) GeneralAlignment and It6 & Mester's (1994) concept ofCodaCond, Hong (1997) proposes the following:Align-Left (\[larygeal\], G) .This is based on Lombardi's (1995a,b) proposal oflaryngeal neutralization.
That is, laryngeal featuressuch as aspiration or voicing appears only in thesyllable-initial position.
However, the scope of Koreancoda neutralization is not limited only to laryngealneutralization, since alveolar fricatives and alveo-palatal affricates are also neutralized as a plain lenisalveolar stop It/ as described above.
Furthermore, avoiced stop can occur in an ambisyllabic coda positionby means of Lenis Stop Voicing as shown in (19) later.2(8) !DENT-IO \[F\] (McCarthy, 1995a)Correspondent elements in S 1 and $2have identical values for feature \[F\].

However, asshown in (6), English kiss is not pronounced as\[kit\] but \[kistu\], which means ID\[cont\] shouldoutrank DEP in IL-K-E. On the other hand, top isusually pronounced as \[thap\] not as \[#aphtu\],which means DEP outranks ID\[svf\] as shown in(11).
That is, the modification of \[continuant\]feature is severer than that of \[svf\] feature.

Candidates (c, d,e) satisfy both SCC and A-L(cont, o), and violateID\[cont\], ID\[son\] and ID\[vd\].
However,candidates (d, e) violate ID\[lat\] and ID\[place\]respectively, which candidate (c) does notviolate.
So candidate (c) is selected.When Koreans transfer this obstruentnasalization phenomenon to English, pick me upis pronounced as \[phiq.mi.^p\] and big mouse as\[piq.ma.u.stu\].
Resyllabification is also related to3 This corresponds to Murray & Vennemann(1983) and Vennemann's (1988) Syllable ContactLaw, which was based on Hooper (1976).
Davis &Shin (1997) propose such a constraint and Hong(1997) adopts it.3SCC.

Between the two candidates, (c) isjudged optimal since it satisfies the ID\[cont\]constraint, oo, while (d) violates it.However, a compound word wus.os /us.os/'upper garment' is not pronounced as \[u.sot\] but as\[udot\].
This indicates that the coda/s/belongingto the first word wus is neutralized as/ t /and thislenis stop becomes voiced between two vowels.To avoid misjudging \[u.sot\] as optimal, Align-Left (7) is clarified as (16) and another Alignconstraint such as (17) is proposed, followingHong (1997).

However, I will not dealwith them in this paper.s In fact, Is/ becomes palatalized before a highfront vocoid.
But I skip this phenomenon in this paper.The other issue is that ONSET can also play a role fortriggering resyllabification.
However, SCC covers therole of ONSET, i.e., ONSET can be regarded as asubset of SCC.Mester,1994).
Accordingly, (16) does not allowaspirated stops, fortis stops, fricatives, oraffricates to occur in the coda position whetherthey are ambisyllabic or not.
On the other hand,(17) allows the last element of the root word tobecome ambisyllabic, but does not allow it to bedisconnected from the original word.Proposing a Voice constraint (18) to dealwith Korean Lenis Stop Voicing phenomenon, letus consider how to syllabify wus.os.

Syl lable Generat ion  o f  Korean  AccentedEngl ish in OT3.1 ProblemsAccording to Hammond (1997b), the greatestproblem in OT-based implementation is thepossibility of the infinite candidate set whenepenthesis (violation of DEP) or deletion(violation of MAX) are allowed, since Gen canproduce infinitely any candidates.
Even if there isno epenthesis or deletion, assuming that anysegment can be syllabified as an onset, peak,coda or unparsed element, a word with nelements may have 4" possible syllabifications,which is an exponential problem.
In addition,each candidate has to be tested by eachconstraint.
That is, the combination of thenumber of candidates times the number ofconstraints must be considered, which is anarithmetic but still nontrivial problem.To solve these problems, he proposes: I)implementation of syllabification is made by aform of a parser, which does not need to considerepenthesis nor deletion; 2) syllabification isencoded locally; and 3) a cyclic CON-EVAL loopis applied constraint by constraint.The problems of implementation of IL-K-Ein OT are more complicated than those raised byHammond, since ambisyllabicity, epenthesis, andsegment modification should be considered.
Theallow epenthesis, even if the final segment is a voicedstop.
More experimental research is required on thisissue, and I will skip this in this paper.system dealing with such syllabification cannot bea parser but a generator.
73.2 Korean  accented  Eng l i sh  GeneratorI assume that the initial candidate set produced byGen can be predictable and finite, following theprevious researches (Ellison, 1994; Tesar, 1995;Eisner, 1997; Hammond, 1995, 1997b).
I adoptthe concept of local encoding (Hammond, 1995,1997b) developed from the concept of finite stateautomata (Ellison, 1994) and that of dynamicprogramming (Tesar, 1995).
Unlike Hammond,however, since the role of this generator is notonly syllabifying the input segments but alsomodifying them into suitable output segments, Isuppose there are two templates of candidategrids: one representing syllable positions, and theother representing potential segment outputforms.Supposing the input is a phrase like stop it,whose string of phonemes is /s  t h a ph # i th/, thegrids look like below:(22) Grid A (for syllable position)s t h a ph # i t hO O O O O O On n n n n n nnn nn an nn nn nn nnC C C C C C CCO CO CO CO CO CO COon on  on  on  on  on  onU U U U U U U(23) Grid B (for output segments 8)7 Hammond ifferentiates, "The generator wouldstart with an input form, generate candidatesyllabifications, and apply constraints to produce asyllabified output.
A parser would start with anunsyllabified output, generate candidates, and producea syllabified output" (p.6).s In producing candidates for segments, onlythose which may become optimal forms in somesituations are considered.
The number of candidates forS t h a ph # i t hS t h .a ph # i t"t p ~ td b dn m ns w t n w ph w t h wAs shown in (22), each segment can be an onset,a nucleus, two nuclei, 9 a coda, an ambisyllabiccoda-onset, an onset + a nucleus (due toepenthesis), or an unparsed segment.
Deletion isnot considered in the current project.
Constraints(cyclic CON-EVAL) prune away disfavoredcandidates cyclically.
If there is only one memberleft in the candidate set, it should not be prunedaway by any constraint.
Grid A (22) is treatedfirst, and then Grid B (23) is treated.There are constraints such as NUCrequiring a nucleus in a syllable, and*MARGIN/V saying a vowel cannot be an onsetor a coda, and *PEAK/C saying a consonantcannot be a nucleus.
So, if a segment is a vowel,all candidates but 'nn' (for a diphthong) or 'n' (foranother vowel) are removed, and if a consonant,'n' and 'nn' is removed as shown in (24) (theremovable candidate is italicized andunderlined):(24) NUC, *MARGIN/V, *PEAK/Cs t" a p"  # i t"o o _o o o p_ on_ _n n n_ n n _nn n n_.n_ nn nn nn nn nnc c _c c c g cco co c._.Q, co co c._..Q coon  on  o_v_ on  on  o__v_ onu u _u u u _u I usegments depends on the types of segments.
Forexample, a voiceless stop has five candidates:aspirated one, unaspirated one, voiced one, nasal one,and epenthesized one, while a nasal has only onecandidate, itself.9 Many Koreans tend to regard an English6dipthong like/arJ as two distinctive vowels like/a i/.I adopt Hammond's idea of housekeeping,too, and propose the following cases:(25) Housekeepinga.
word-initial coda and coda-onsetb.
word-final onsetc.
phrase-final coda-onsetd.
word-final coda before another wordstarting with a vowele.
no parsing of word boundaryA word cannot start with 'c' or 'co' (a), and cannotend with 'o' (b).
'co' can occur in the word finalposition, but not in the phrase final position (c).
A'c' in a word-final position is deleted if it followsby '#' and 'n' (due to the SCC(13)) (d).
A wordboundary '#' has only 'u' (e).

*COM does not allow a sequence of 'o + o', or 'c+ c'.

footnote 9), but also an obstruentfollowed by it tends to be epenthesized (cf.
6-c), sothat 'c' and 'co' in this position may be deleted.
I thinkthis phenomenon is also related to *COM.

It tries togenerate not only syllable positions but alsomodified output segments.There are some Korean phonologicalphenomena, which are not considered at thecurrent system.
They are palatalization, I l l-/r/alternation, etc.
Next step is dealing with thesephenomena.IL among L2 learners must be differentaccording to the learners, and it is not always thesame even in the same person.
The currentsystem produces only one type of output based onthe transfer of some Korean phonology.
Furtherefforts will be made to generate several possibleIL pronunciations according to the differentlevels of proficiency.4.
Conc lus ionThis paper deals with an OT-based generator forInterlanguage phonology of Korean speakers ofEnglish.
Hammond (1997b) insists that OT-basedsyllabification be made as a parser which doesnot need to consider epenthesis or deletion.However, in order to syllabify Korean accentedEnglish, not only epenthesis but also segmentmodification such as stop voicing/devoicing orstop nasalization should be considered.I adopted the basic ideas proposed byHammond and others: finite candidate set, cyclicCON-EVAL and local encoding.
I proposed twotemplates of candidate sets: one representingsyllable positions (onset, nucleus, two nuclei,coda, ambisyllabic coda-onset, onset +epenthesized vowel, and unparsed position), theother epresenting potential output forms for eachsegment.
Under the basic syllable constraints, theoptimal candidates in the syllable position gridare selected.
The result is used to generate thepotential output segments which can be revisedfrom the original input segments under theconstraints basically applicable to Koreanphonology.9ReferencesAhn, Sang-Cheol.
