QARAB: A Question Answering System to Supportthe Arabic LanguageBassam Hammo  Hani Abu-Salem  Steven LytinenDePaul UniversitySchool of Computer Science, Telecommunications and Information Systems243 S. Wabash Avenue, Chicago IL 60604bhammo@condor.depaul.edu habusalem@cti.depaul.edu lytinen@cs.depaul.eduMartha EvensIllinois Institute of TechnologyComputer Science Department10 West 31st Street, Chicago, IL 60616evens@iit.eduAbstractWe describe the design andimplementation of a question answering(QA) system called QARAB.
It is asystem that takes natural languagequestions expressed in the Arabiclanguage and attempts to provide shortanswers.
The system?s primary sourceof knowledge is a collection of Arabicnewspaper text extracted from Al-Raya,a newspaper published in Qatar.
Duringthe last few years the informationretrieval community has attacked thisproblem for English using standard IRtechniques with only mediocre success.We are tackling this problem for Arabicusing traditional Information Retrieval(IR) techniques coupled with asophisticated Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) approach.
To identifythe answer, we adopt a keywordmatching strategy along with matchingsimple structures extracted from boththe question and the candidatedocuments selected by the IR system.To achieve this goal, we use an existingtagger to identify proper names andother crucial lexical items and buildlexical entries for them on the fly.
Wealso carry out an analysis of Arabicquestion forms and attempt a betterunderstanding of what kinds of answersusers find satisfactory.
The paucity ofstudies of real users has limited resultsin earlier research.1 IntroductionIn recent years, there has been a marked increasein the amount of data available on the Internet.Users often have specific questions in mind, forwhich they hope to get answers.
They would likethe answers to be short and precise, and theyalways prefer to express the questions in theirnative language without being restricted to aspecific query language, query formation rules, oreven a specific knowledge domain.
The newapproach taken to matching the user needs is tocarry out actual analysis of the question from alinguistic point of view and to attempt tounderstand what the user really means.QARAB is the result of coupling traditionalInformation Retrieval (IR) techniques with asophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP)approach.
The approach can be summarized asfollows: the IR system treats the question as aquery in an attempt to identify the candidatedocuments that may contain the answer; then theNLP techniques are used to parse the question andanalyze the top ranked documents returned by theIR system.Natural Language Processing (NLP) in theArabic language is still in its initial stagecompared to the work in the English language,which has already benefited from the extensiveresearch in this field.
There are some aspects thatslow down progress in Arabic Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) compared to theaccomplishments in English and other Europeanlanguages [Al-Daimi & Abdel-Amir, 1994].These aspects include:?
Arabic is highly inflectional and derivational,which makes morphological analysis a verycomplex task.?
The absence of diacritics (which representmost vowels) in the written text createsambiguity and therefore, complexmorphological rules are required to identifythe tokens and parse the text.?
The writing direction is from right-to-left andsome of the characters change their shapesbased on their location in the word.?
Capitalization is not used in Arabic, whichmakes it hard to identify proper names,acronyms, and abbreviations.In addition to the above linguistic issues, thereis also a lack of Arabic corpora, lexicons, andmachine-readable dictionaries, which are essential toadvance research in different areas.2 BackgroundAdvances in natural language processing (NLP),information retrieval techniques (IR), informationextraction (IE), as well as the computer industry,have given QA a strong boost.
Modern question-answering systems have started incorporatingNLP techniques to parse natural languagedocuments, extract entities and relations betweenentities, resolve anaphora, and other languageambiguities [Harabagiu et al, 2000; Vicedo &Ferr?ndez, 2000].Research in Question-Answering (QA) is notnew.
The QA problem has been addressed in theliterature since the beginning of computingmachines.
The AI/NLP communities initiatedtraditional work to address question-answeringusing structural methods.
Early experiments inthis direction implemented systems that operate invery restricted domains (e.g.
SHRDLU[Winogard, 1972] and LUNAR [Woods, 1972]).In the QUALM system, Lehnert [1978] took afurther step, based on the conceptual theories ofSchank & Abelson [1977], to understand thenature of the questions and classify them in a waysimilar to how human beings understand andanswer questions.
SCISOR [Jacobs & Rau 1990]aimed at question answering and text extractionmore than information retrieval.
It combinednatural language processing, knowledgerepresentation, and information retrievaltechniques with lexical analysis and word-basedtext searches.
The MURAX system [Kupiec,1993] used robust linguistic methods to answerclosed-class natural language questions.
Itpresented the user with relevant text in whichnoun phrases are marked.
A less automatedapproach like Ask Jeeves [1996] approached theQA problem by pointing the questioner to Weblinks that might contain information relevant tothe answer to the question.
Ask Jeeves benefitedfrom advanced natural language processingtechniques combined with data mining processingand a huge expanding knowledge base.
Anothersystem, with a different approach, is theFAQFinder system [Burke et al, 1997], whichattempted to solve the question-answeringproblem using a database of question-answer pairsbuilt from existing frequently asked question(FAQ) files.
Two other important systems are theSTART system [Katz, 1997], which is based onannotations from the Web and the Q&A system[Budzik & Hammond, 1999], which is asemiautomatic, natural language question-answering and referral system.
The system isbased on a huge knowledge base and humanexperts who volunteered their time to respond tothe users?
questions.Recently, attention has begun to be focusedon developing question-answering systems that donot rely on a knowledge base and that can fetchanswers from huge unstructured text.
New QAsystems enhanced with NLP and IR techniqueshave been developed to extract textual answers foropen-domain questions and provide a frameworkfor modern information retrieval [TREC-8, 1999;TREC-9, 2000].The overall aim of this QA track was toretrieve small pieces of text that contain the actualanswer to the question rather than the list ofdocuments traditionally returned by retrievalengines [Voorhees & Tice, 2000].
The TREC-8QA track attracted researchers from both industryand academia.
Twenty organizations participatedin this track with different approaches and theirsystems were evaluated.
The participatingsystems were tested on a huge set of unstructureddocuments and a set of fact-based questions.Generally speaking, most of the TREC-8long-string answer (250-bytes) participantsattempted to solve the QA problem from theinformation retrieval (IR) point of view bylocating the most relevant documents from thecollection and then extracting the sentences mostrelevant to the query from the documents justlocated.
The systems relying on this ?bag-of-words?
approach (e.g.
[Allan et al, 1999];[Cormack et al, 1999]; [Lin & Chen, 1999]; [Shinet al, 1999] and the passage-retrieval run ofAT&T [Singhal et al, 1999]) deal with thequestion without considering its grammatical orsemantic characteristics and they applyconventional IR techniques to extract the answer.Even though the ?bag-of-words?
approach wascommonly used in TREC-8, the systems based onthis approach were inadequate to handle the short-string (50-byte) answers.On the contrary, the short string (50-byte)participants (e.g.
[Breck et al, 1999]; [Ferret etal., 1999]; [Hull, 1999]; [Humphreys et al, 1999];[Litkowski, 1999]; [Moldovan et al, 2000]; [Oardet al, 1999]; [Singhal et al, 1999]) agreed on theimportance of applying several natural languageprocessing techniques to solve the problem.Among these techniques are: part-of-speechtagging, shallow parsing, query type identificationand named entity recognition.
Because thenumber of test documents to be analyzed for eachquery was huge, the majority of the systems inthis band used the ?bag-of-words?
approach as aninitial step to retrieve the relevant passages thatcontain the possible answer.
Another approach tothe QA problem combines IR techniques withInformation Extraction (IE) techniques forextracting named entities, e.g., [Ogden et al,1999]; [Takaki, 1999]; and [Srihari & Li, 1999].A detailed description of the track and the resultsare available at [Voorhees & Tice, 1999].It is obvious from the increasing number ofsystems participating in TREC-9 and theworldwide interest in this research area thatQuestion Answering is the most promisingframework for finding answers to naturallanguage questions from a huge amount of textualdata.
Cardie et al [2000] pointed out thatbuilding ?open-ended question answering systemsthat allow users to pose questions of any type andin any language, without domain restrictions, isstill beyond the scope of any QA system today?
(p.180).
Harabagiu et al [2000] indicated thatadvanced tools (such as dialog understanding andtext mining) are essential for the success of futureQA systems.
Until the advanced tools areimplemented, she suggested that we keepapproximating the complexity of QuestionAnswering with NLP enhancements of IR and IEtechniques [Harabagiu et al, 2000].3 QARAB System3.1 OverviewIn the last decade, the volume of Arabictextual data has started growing on the Web andArabic software for browsing the Web isimproving.
Unfortunately, much of the earlierArabic text available on the Web was posted asimages, which makes it unsuitable for search orprocessing.
As of today, there is an increase in theamount of Arabic textual material available on theWeb in the form of news articles and books.The main goal of the QARAB system is toidentify text passages that answer a naturallanguage question.
The task can be summarized asfollows: Given a set of questions expressed inArabic, find answers to the questions under thefollowing assumptions:?
The answer exists in a collection of Arabicnewspaper text extracted from the Al-Rayanewspaper published in Qatar.?
The answer does not span through documents(i.e.
all supporting information for the answerlies in one document)?
The answer is a short passage.The basic QA processing in QARAB iscomposed of three major steps:?
Processing the input question?
Retrieving the candidate documents(paragraphs) containing answers from the IRsystem?
Processing each one of the candidatedocuments (paragraphs) in the same way asthe question is processed and returningsentences that may contain the answer.The QARAB system will be evaluated over awide range of question types provided by Arabicusers during the testing and the final phases.
Thesame users will then assess whether the answersproduced by the system are satisfactory.3.2 QARAB StructureThe complete QARAB system is depicted inFigure 1; it has the following overall structure:3.2.1 The IR SystemThe IR system, which we are implementing fromscratch, is based on Salton?s vector space model[Salton, 1971].
First, it processes the textcollection from the Al-Raya newspaper andconstructs an inverted file system, from which theanswers to the natural language questions will beextracted.
The purpose of the IR system is tosearch the document collection to selectdocuments containing information relevant to theuser?s query.Implementing the Information RetrievalSystemInformation Retrieval (IR) systems can beconstructed in many various ways.
Lundquist etal.
[1999] proposed an Information Retrieval (IR)system that can be constructed using a relationaldatabase management system (RDBMS).
Our IRsystem is depicted in Figure 2 and it contains thefollowing database relations:?
ROOT_TABLE (Root_ID, Root) ?
to store theavailable distinct roots of the terms extractedfrom the Al-Raya document collection (onerow per root).?
STEM_TABLE (Stem_ID, Root_ID, Stem,Document_Frequency, IDF) ?
to store alldistinct stems from the document collection.The stem frequency in the entire documentcollection and the inverse documentfrequency of each stem are calculated andstored (one row per stem).?
POSTING_TABLE (Posting_ID, Stem_ID,Document_ID, Paragraph_ID, Position,Length) ?
to store all the occurrences of thestems extracted from the entire documentcollection (one row per stem).?
DOCUMENT_TABLE (Document_ID,Document_Title, Document_Date,Document_Path) ?
to store documentinformation (one row per document)?
PARAGRAPH_TABLE (Paragraph_ID,Document_ID, Paragraph) ?
to store all theparagraphs extracted from the documentcollection (one row per paragraph).
Thisspeeds up the analysis and the processing ofthe relevant passages that might answer to theuser?s question.?
QUERY_TABLE (Word, Weight) ?
to storequery information.
This includes the originalquery words and the set of expanded words.The set of expanded words is obtained byextracting the available roots of the originalquery words, finding their equivalentRoot_ID?s in the ROOT_TABLE, and thenfinding their corresponding terms stored in theSTEM_TABLE.
The weight of each word iscalculated and stored (one row per word).NLP ToolsLexiconMorphologyAnalyzerSystemTokenizerSystemType FinderSystem &Parsing PNPSystemMainTablePronounTableParticleTableNounTableVerbTableKeywordTableAdjectiveTablePropernounTableCategoryTableProductTableTimeTablePoliticalLocationNaturalLocationPersonalNameEventsTableOrganizationTableFigure 1.
System Components3.2.2 The NLP SystemThe second component of the system (the NLPsystem) shown in Figure 1 was implemented byAbuleil [1999] to experiment in building a largeArabic lexicon.
The NLP system is composed of aset of tools to tokenize and tag Arabic text,identify some features of the tokens and, mostimportant, to identify proper names.
Thefollowing is a description of the overall structureand functionality of the NLP system.Figure 2.
Relational Database InformationRetrieval SystemThe tagger was designed to construct acomprehensive Arabic lexicon.
The system isused to parse Arabic words and determine theirparts of speech (verbs, nouns, particles).
Also it isused to figure out the features of each word(gender, number, person, tense), mark propernouns in the text and determine their types(personal names, locations, organizations, times,dates, etc.
).The NLP system comprises the followingmodules:?
The tokenizer, which is used to extract thetokens.?
The type finder, which is used to assign apart-of-speech to each token.?
The feature finder, which is used to determinethe features of each word.?
The proper noun phrase parser, which is usedto mark proper nouns.The type finder module starts a lexicon lookupprocess for each token.
When there is an unknownword in the text, the system can apply the propernoun phrase parser to tag the word as a propernoun.
The recognition process occurs in multiplestages in which a list of patterns and heuristicsmay be applied to mark the proper noun.
Whenthe word is tagged as a proper noun, it is addedautomatically to the lexicon with all its possiblefeatures.
Being able to identify the proper names,among other actual entities, in the text is animportant step in understanding and using the text.Unfortunately, this is not a straightforward task inArabic as it is in English and most Europeanlanguages since the uppercase/lowercasedistinction does not exist in Arabic text.
Thus, wehave to learn more about the common patterns inwhich these entities occur in Arabic contexts.4 The Basic Outline of Processingin the IR System4.1 Document ProcessingThis step is essential for our system.
First, thenewspaper articles from the Al-Raya newspaperare saved in text format using the Arabic Windows1256 encoding scheme.
This is performed toextract all the html tags and to get the pure textcontents of the articles.
Second, the IR system isconstructed using the relational database model asexplained above.
This step involves tokenization,stop-word removal, root extraction, and termweighting.4.2 Extracting the RootIn general, to extract Arabic roots from theirwords, the stemmer has to process each word inthe following order [Khoja, 1999]:?
Removing the Definite Article ??
?al??
Removing the Conjunction Letter ?
?w??
Removing Suffixes?
Removing Prefixes?
Pattern MatchingThe following example demonstrates thewhole stemming process applied to the Arabicword ?????????
?wlydrsooha?, which is mapped tothe complete English sentence ?and they aregoing to study it?.
The root of this word can beextracted as follows:(w)-(l)-(y)-drs-(oo)-(ha)      )??)(?(???
-)?
( -(?)-(?
)1.
Removing the conjunction letter (w) )?(?
)??)(?
( ???-)?
( -(?)2.
Removing the suffix (ha) )??
( , which indicatesa feminine, singular patient?
)?(???
-)?
(  -(?)3.
Removing the suffix: (oo) )?
( , which indicatesa masculine third person plural agent?
)???
-)?
-(?)4.
Removing the preposition prefix (l) )?(?
)???
-)?5.
Removing the prefix: (y) )?
( , which indicatesa 3rd person, present tense ?
???6.
The pattern ???
F9L has the same length as theword ???
drs.
Then the stemmer detects thatthe word ???
matches the pattern  ???
?, sinceall the letters of the word match those in thepattern (i.e.
??
??
?
)7.
Finally, the stemmer checks the trilateral rootstable and concludes that the root ???
drs (hestudied) is a valid root.5 Question Processing in QARABAchieving question understanding requires deepsemantic processing, which is a non-trivial task ofnatural language processing.
In fact, Arabic NLPdoes not have solid research at the semantic level.Therefore, QARAB uses shallow languageunderstanding to process questions and it does notattempt to understand the content of the questionat a deep, semantic level.QARAB treats the incoming question as a?bag of words?
against which the index file issearched to obtain a list of ranked documents thatpossibly contain the answer.
The questionprocessing begins by performing tokenization toextract individual terms.
Then, the stop-words areremoved.
The remaining words are tagged forpart-of-speech in an attempt to highlight the mainwords that should appear in the hypothesizedanswer.
The greatest effort should be spent onidentifying proper names, as they are our bestguidance to identify the possible answer.
Theinterrogative particles that precede the questionswill determine what types of answers are expectedas shown in Table 1.5.1  Query ExpansionTo achieve better search and retrieval results thequery is expanded to include all the terms (verbsand nouns derived from verbs) that occur in theindex file and have the same roots, which wereextracted from the original query words.
Theresult of the query processing is then passed to theIR system to retrieve a ranked list of documentsthat match the terms of the query.5.2  Query TypeQuestions are classified based on a set of known?question types?.
These question types help us todetermine the type of processing needed toidentify and extract the final answer.
The QARABsystem recognizes the following set of questiontypes (Table1):Table 1.
Question Types Processed by theQARAB SystemQuery Starting with Query Type??
Who, Whose Person???
When Date, Time?????
??
What, Which Organization, Product,Event???
Where Location (natural,                 political)??
How Much, How ManyNumber, QuantityThere are two other types of questionparticles, namely ???
and ?????
(How and Why).Although they will form legitimate querystructures, they require long and proceduralanswers and are beyond the scope of our research.It is worth mentioning that the How and the Whyqueries also caused problems for many TREC-8participants.5.3  Query Keyword IdentificationThe remaining words of the query (after removingpunctuation and stop-words) are tagged for part ofspeech.
This process requires using the Type-Finder  & the Proper Name-Finder systemimplemented by Abuleil [1999].
Verbs, whichalmost always follow clear morphologicalpatterns, are the easiest to identify.
Nouns,especially proper nouns, are considered as ourbest guide to find the expected answer from therelevant documents returned by the IR system.They have to occur within the selected answerpassage and must be in the same order as theyappeared in the original question.
A list ofkeywords to identify personal names,organization names, locations, numbers, moneyand dates, has been constructed for Arabic to helpin identifying proper names.6 Answer Processing in QARABThe input to the QARAB Answer Generatormodule is a natural language question and a smallset of ranked documents.
The question is firstprocessed by tagging all the words.
Then the setof relevant documents that may contain theanswer are retrieved by the IR system.
In theanswer generation process, the passages of therelevant documents that match (are similar to) thequery?s ?bag of words?
closely are collected forfurther processing.
The answer zones usuallyinclude most of the terms appearing in the originalquery in addition to the proper nouns that shouldappear in the final answer.
The followingexample illustrates the whole process taken by theQARAB system to answer a question.The following document extracted from thenewspaper Al-Raya published in Qatar wasprocessed by the IR system:???

?.7  ConclusionWe have described an approach to questionanswering system that provides short answers toquestions expressed in the Arabic language.
Thesystem utilizes techniques from IR and NLP toprocess a collection of Arabic text documents asits primary source of knowledge.
An actualsystem named QARAB is implemented and aninitial ad-hoc analysis seems to be promising.
Theoverall success of the system is limited to theamount of available tools developed for theArabic language.
Work is undergoing to getretrieval integrated into the system and to extendthe functionality of the NLP system by developingmore sophisticated algorithms to produce aconcise answer in a timely manner.ReferencesAbuleil, S., and Evens, M., 1998.
