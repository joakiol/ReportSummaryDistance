Inference in Computational Semantics ICoS-5Buxton, EnglandApril 20?21, 2006Workshop ProceedingsJohan Bos and Alexander Koller (Eds.
)About ICoSNatural Language Processing has reached a stage where the exploration and development ofinference is one of its most pressing tasks.
On the theoretical side, it is clear that inferenceplays a key role in such areas as semantic construction and the management of discourseand dialogue.
On the practical side, the use of sophisticated inference methods is expectedto play a crucial role in such application areas as natural language generation, automaticquestion answering, and spoken dialogue systems.
At the same time, inference tools andresources have matured to the point that they can become useful for actual applications.Automated theorem provers and other inference tools are becoming increasingly robust andefficient.
And the world knowledge bottleneck is being addressed from different angles, bythe manual development of knowledge resources, the merging of existing such resources,and the automated extraction of world knowledge from corpora.The Inference in Computational Semantics (ICoS) workshops are intended to bringtogether researchers from areas such as Computational Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science, Formal Semantics, and Logic, to discuss approaches to, and applica-tions of, inference in natural language semantics.
ICoS-1 took place in Amsterdam, theNetherlands, on August 15, 1999.
ICoS-2 was organised in Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, onJuly 29?30, 2000.
ICoS-3 was co-located with the International Joint Conference on Au-tomated Reasoning (IJCAR 2001), which took place on June 18?23, 2001 at Siena, Italy.ICoS-4 took place in Nancy, France, on September 25?26, 2003.Welcome to ICoS-5ICoS-5 is organised as a two-day event at the University of Derby College, Buxton, Eng-land, taking place on April 20?21.
The programme features three invited presentations(by Christian Ebert, Patrick Pantel, and Stephen Pulman).
In addition, we have selectedtwelve regular papers from 24 submissions, which span topics ranging from the use of infer-ence techniques for formal and computational semantics, over new methods for knowledgeextraction from corpora, to NLP applications that use inference tools.We have accepted six of the remaining submissions as ?short papers?.
These paperswill be presented as posters and demos at the workshop, and we believe that this newformat will be a worthwhile experience both for authors and for participants.We would like to thank the members of the programme committee, who produced highlyinformative reviews and made it possible to set up the broad and strong program for ICoS-5.
Finally, we are very grateful to the local organisers, Ian Pratt-Hartmann and AllanRamsay, who did a flawless job of preparing what promises to be a wonderful workshoplocation for us.Rome and Saarbru?cken, March 2006Johan Bos & Alexander Koller (co-chairs)iiiivWorkshop OrganizationProgramme CommitteeCarlos Areces INRIA LorrainePeter Baumgartner National ICT AustraliaChristoph Benzmueller University of the SaarlandRaffaella Bernardi Free University of Bozen-BolzanoPatrick Blackburn INRIA LorraineJohan Bos (co-chair) University of Roma ?La Sapienza?Harry Bunt Tilburg UniversityAnn Copestake University of CambridgeDick Crouch PARCIdo Dagan Bar Ilan UniversityKees van Deemter University of AberdeenNissim Francez TechnionClaire Gardent CNRS/LORIAAlexander Koller (co-chair) University of the SaarlandShalom Lappin King?s College LondonAlex Lascarides University of EdinburghBernardo Magnini ITC-IrstKatja Markert University of LeedsDan Moldovan University of Texas at DallasJeff Pelletier Simon Fraser UniversityMaarten de Rijke University of AmsterdamMichael Schiehlen University of StuttgartMatthew Stone RutgersBonnie Webber University of EdinburghLocal OrganizersIan Pratt-Hartmann School of Computer Science, University of ManchesterAllan Ramsay School of Informatics, University of ManchestervviTable of ContentsAbstracts of Invited TalksExpressive Power and Complexity of Underspecified Representations .

157Paul PiwekviiiExpressive Power and Complexityof Underspecified RepresentationsChristian EbertFakulta?t fu?r Linguistik und LiteraturwissenschaftUniversita?t BielefeldMy talk will be about two requirements on Underspecified Representation Formalisms inthe context of underspecification of scope.
The requirement on partial disambiguation,stating that partially disambiguated ambiguities need to be represented, does not carrymuch content unless it has become clear, exactly what those ambiguities are.
In line withKo?nig and Reyle [1999], I will argue that all theoretically possible patterns of ambiguity,i.e.
subsets of readings, can occur in natural language, in particular when underspeci-fied representations are assumed to represent patterns of ambiguity that arise throughdisambiguation by discourse or even by world knowledge.
Therefore an underspecifiedrepresentation formalism can only be regarded as expressively complete, if it provides rep-resentations for all potential subsets of readings.
Taking a closer look at recent prominentapproaches to scope underspecification, namely Hole Semantics [Bos, 2002], Minimal Re-cursion Semantics [Copestake et al, 1999], and Normal Dominance Constraints [Koller,2004], it turns out that none of these formalisms is expressively complete.
Furthermore,these incompleteness results allow for a straightforward comparison of the discussed ap-proaches with respect to expressive power.The second requirement is the avoidance of combinatorial explosion.
I will argue thatthe decisive process that determines the efficiency of an underspecification approach isthe construction phase of the representations and not so much the check for satisfiabilityor enumeration of readings.
Thus the desired avoidance of combinatorial explosion comesdown to a requirement on a feasible construction procedure and hence to a requirement onthe maximal ?size?
of the representations, which can only be fulfilled if the involved repre-sentations are in some sense more compact than the mere listing of the available readings.Unfortunately it turns out that due to the rapid growth of the number of potential patternsof ambiguity, the two requirements of compactness and expressive completeness cannot befulfilled at the same time.
In other words, I will show that any underspecified representa-tion formalism must necessarily miss out on some of the potential patterns of ambiguityor run into the combinatorial explosion problem [Ebert, 2005].ReferencesJohan Bos.

Kluwer, 1999.12Knowledge Harvesting and Fusion from Small and Large CorporaPatrick PantelISI, University of Southern CaliforniaInferencing requires large collections of axioms and knowledge bases of interrelatedconcepts and instances.
In the past decade, researchers have explored many approaches toautomatically learn such knowledge from textual corpora.
In this two-part talk, we willdiscuss the challenges of harvesting knowledge from various corpus sizes and we willlook at some recent attempts at fusing the knowledge into a single semantic repository.On the harvesting front, we will focus on the challenges posed by three types of corpora:i) the Web (order of 1012 words) ?
pattern learning algorithms, models of reliability, andscalable computing; ii) large corpora such as newswire collections (order of 109 words) ?amenable to complex natural language processing and clustering; and iii) small corporasuch as college textbooks (order of 105 words) ?
in which low redundancy requiresleveraging external resources such as the Web and ontologies.This multitude of harvested knowledge inevitably overlaps and is partially inconsistentand incompatible since information can be expressed across data sources in so manyways.
However, little effort has been spent on fusing such harvested knowledge into anoverarching consistent semantic repository.
We will present a recent algorithm for linkingsemantic resources using grammatical templates.
We will also present an algorithm toautomatically induce conceptual relations between mid-level ontological concepts andthen disambiguate instances with regard to the most appropriate senses in the ontology,using the induced conceptual relations.34Bridging the gap between formal and computational semanticsStephen PulmanComputational Linguistics Group, Oxford University.The literature in formal linguistic semantics contains a wealth of fine grainedand detailed analyses of many linguistic phenomena.
But very little of this workhas found its way into implementations, despite a widespread feeling (amonglinguists at least) that this can?t be very difficult in principle: you just fix agrammar to produce the right logical forms and hook them up to a theoremprover, don?t you?
In this talk I take a representative analysis of adjectivalcomparatives and ask what steps one might actually have to go through so as touse this analysis in a realistic question-answering setting.
I then try to identifysome general conclusions that can be drawn from this exercise.5
