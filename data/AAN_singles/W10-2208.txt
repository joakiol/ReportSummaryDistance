Proceedings of the 11th Meeting of the ACL-SIGMORPHON, ACL 2010, pages 63?71,Uppsala, Sweden, 15 July 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsToward a Totally Unsupervised, Language-Independent Method for theSyllabification of Written TextsThomas MayerDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of Konstanz, Germanythomas.mayer@uni-konstanz.deAbstractUnsupervised algorithms for the inductionof linguistic knowledge should at best re-quire as few basic assumptions as pos-sible and at the same time in principleyield good results for any language.
How-ever, most of the time such algorithms areonly tested on a few (closely related) lan-guages.
In this paper, an approach is pre-sented that takes into account typologicalknowledge in order to induce syllabic di-visions in a fully automatic manner basedon reasonably-sized written texts.
Our ap-proach is able to account for syllable struc-tures of languages where other approacheswould fail, thereby raising the questionwhether computational methods can reallybe claimed to be language-universal whenthey are not tested on the variety of struc-tures that are found in the languages of theworld.1 IntroductionMany approaches developed in the field of com-putational linguistics are only tested and optimizedfor one language (mostly English) or a small set ofclosely related languages, but at the same time areoften claimed to be applicable to any natural lan-guage, cf.
Bender (2009).
Our aim is to stress theimportance of having a more varied sample of lan-guages that include the different types that can befound in the languages of the world in order to dojustice to the range of variation in linguistic struc-tures across languages.
Furthermore, we want topoint to the usefulness of using typological knowl-edge for a language-universal approach.In this paper, we present an unsupervised,language-independent syllabification methodbased on raw unannotated texts in a phonemictranscription.
The methods and procedurespresented in this work rest upon insights fromtypological work and do not need any additionallanguage-dependent information.
The main pur-pose of this paper is not to present an improvementon already established statistical approaches tothe problem of syllabification of an individuallanguage, but to introduce data from languagesthat might constitute a problem for many syl-labification methods that have been optimizedon languages like English and therefore make itnecessary to integrate an additional componentthat is able to handle such cases.The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-lows.
First, it is argued in Section 2 that ortho-graphic texts (in any alphabetic script) can be usedfor the induction of phonological patterns if thespelling system is reasonably close to a phonemictranscription.
The syllabification process can bedivided into two steps.
In Section 3, we presentand evaluate an algorithm for an unsupervisedclassification of all symbols in the input texts intovowels and consonants.
Based on this classifica-tion, a syllabification procedure is discussed thatmakes use of distributional information of clus-ters in order to break up vowel and consonant se-quences into syllables (Section 4).
Finally, weconclude with a discussion of the advantages anddisadvantages of the present approach and its im-plications for future research.2 Learning phonological patterns on thebasis of written texts?Most studies that are based on original texts areconcerned with research questions that do notmake use of phonological knowledge that hasbeen extracted from the texts.
The reason forthis is obvious.
The orthographies of many well-studied modern languages contain many idiosyn-cratic rules and exceptions that would make it dif-ficult to use them for dealing with phonologicalaspects of the languages under consideration.
On63the other hand, in order to be able to use distribu-tional information for phonological problems thereare not enough reasonably-sized phonetically tran-scribed corpora, especially for a wider range oflanguages.However, many spelling systems do not sufferfrom these shortcomings and thus can be used forthese purposes.
When looking at languages whoseorthographies have been conceived or standard-ized only recently it can be noted thatmany of themare pretty close to a phonemic transcription.
Pro-vided the size of the corpus is big enough, smallerinconsistencies in the spelling system can be con-sidered to be noise in the data.Phonemic orthographies as they are usually de-vised for a new spelling system also show an ad-vantage that phonetic transcriptions lack, namelythat they already group together those symbolsthat represent the same phoneme in the language.1Moreover, obligatory phonological processes suchas final devoicing are mostly not represented in thewritten form (Turkish being a notable exception),thereby providing a sort of underlying representa-tion that is useful to induce which sequences canbe grouped together to morphemes.For these reasons written texts can in our viewalso be used for the induction of phonologicalknowledge for languages with phonemic spellingsystems, even though their results have to be ana-lyzed with great care.3 Sukhotin?s algorithmSukhotin?s algorithm (Sukhotin, 1962, 1973) is atotally unsupervised method to discriminate vow-els from consonants on the basis of a phonemictranscription.
The approach relies on two fun-damental assumptions that are grounded on typo-logical insights.
First, vowels and consonants inwords tend to alternate rather than being groupedtogether.
Second, the most frequent symbol in thecorpus is a vowel.
The latter assumption is usedto initialize the classification step by claiming thatthe most frequent symbol is the first member ofthe vowel class, with the rest of the symbols ini-tially all classified as consonants.
With the help ofthe first assumption the other vowels are then clas-sified by iteratively checking which symbol is less1In the remainder of this paper we will use the term ?sym-bol?
as a more neutral expression for all letters in the writtentexts in order not to be explicit whether the spelling systemreally lives up to the goal of representing phonemes by let-ters.frequently adjacent to the already detected vowels.3.1 Typological basisIt has been noticed in the typological literature atleast since Jakobson and Halle (1956) that there isa tendency in the languages of the world for hav-ing CV as the basic syllable structure.
Of course,languages differ as to the number and types of syl-lables; there are languages that allow a huge vari-ety of consonant (or vowel) clusters whereas othersare stricter in their phonotactic possibilities.
How-ever, all languages seem to obey the universal lawthat CV is more basic than other syllable types andthat ?CV is the only universal model of the sylla-ble.?
Evidence for this comes from different ar-eas of linguistics, including the observation thatno matter how small the number of syllable typesin a language is, it always includes CV.
This isalso reflected in the Onset Maximization Princi-ple (OMP), which states that an intervocalic con-sonant is attributed to the following syllable and isassumed to be a language-universal principle forsyllabification.We are not aware of any cross-linguistic studythat investigated the token frequency of phonemesin larger samples of texts.
Hence, the second as-sumption that the most frequent symbol in a textis always a vowel cannot be backed up by typo-logical knowledge.
However, this claim can besupported indirectly.
In his study on consonant-vowel ratios in 563 languages, Maddieson (2008)states that the ratio ranges between 1.11 and 29.The lowest value has been calculated for the isolatelanguage Andoke, which has 10 consonants and9 vowels.
The mean value is 4.25, though.
Pro-vided that it is always the case that languages havemore consonants than vowel types, it can be arguedthat the fewer vowels have higher token frequen-cies in order to be able to contribute their share tothe make-up of syllables.2 Yet this generalizationis untested and could be wrong for some languages(or rather corpora of those languages).
In our sam-ple of texts in different languages, nevertheless themost frequent symbol is always a vowel.3.2 Description of the algorithmSukhotin?s algorithm is computationally simpleand can even be illustrated with a small toy cor-2In the French corpus that Goldsmith and Xanthos (2009)used in their studies, the most frequent phoneme turned out tobe a consonant.
However, the rest of the classification was notaffected and all remaining phonemes were labelled correctly.64pus.3 Given a corpus with the inventory of n sym-bols S := {s1, .

?The main diagonal, i.e., the self-succession ofsymbols, is ignored by setting all its values tozero.
For instance, given a sample corpus C ={saat, salat, tal, last, stall, lese, seele} we ob-tain the following 5 ?
5 matrix (for ease of un-derstanding the symbols have been put in front ofthe cells of the matrix and the row sums in the lastcolumn):M =???????
?s a t l e Sums 0 3 2 0 3 8a 3 0 3 4 0 10t 2 3 0 0 2 7l 0 4 0 0 3 7e 3 0 2 3 0 8???????
?Sukhotin?s algorithm initially considers all sym-bols to be consonants before it enters an interativephase.
In each cycle of the phase, the symbol withthe highest row sum greater than zero is detectedand classified as a vowel.
The row sum for anysymbol sais calculated by adding up all occur-rences of the symbol saas a first or second mem-ber in a sequence?ni=1mai.
After a new vowelhas been detected, its row sum is set to zero andall other row sums are updated by subtracting fromthe sum of the row of each remaining symbol twicethe number of times it occurs next to the new-foundvowel.
This process is repeated until nomore sym-bols with positive row sums are left.
In our exam-ple, the vectors of row sums (RSum) for all sym-bols in the individual steps of the iteration phaselook as follows:RSum1=(s a t l e8 10 7 7 8)RSum2=(s a t l e2 0 1 ?1 8)3More detailed descriptions can be found in Guy (1991)and Goldsmith and Xanthos (2009).RSum3=(s a t l e?4 0 ?3 ?7 0)The rationale behind this algorithm with respectto its basic assumptions is as follows.
The fact thatinitially the symbol with the highest sum is consid-ered to be a vowel reflects the idea that the mostfrequent symbol in the corpus has to be a vowel.What the row sums after each step actually con-tain is the difference between the number of timesa symbol is found next to a consonant and the num-ber of times it is found next to a vowel.
When-ever a new vowel has been detected all occurrencesof this vowel have to be subtracted from the othersymbols because this symbol is no longer consid-ered to be a consonant.3.3 EvaluationTo the best of our knowledge, the algorithm hasnever been tested on a larger cross-linguistic sam-ple.
There are results for a number of languagesin Sukhotin?s original papers, in Sassoon (1992)and in Goldsmith and Xanthos (2009), yet alostall languages in those samples belong to the Indo-European family (except for Georgian, Hungar-ian and Finnish) or do not fulfill the criterion ofa phonemic transcription (Hebrew).
It thereforestill needs to be tested on a more cross-linguisticsample of languages.
In particular, it is an inter-esting question to see if the algorithm works evenfor those languages that are notorious for havingmany consonant clusters.
On the basis of his sam-ple of five languages, Sassoon (1992) comes tothe conclusion that it works very well on thoselanguages that have only few consonant clustersbut has problems when more complex clusters areinvolved.
However, he also notices that this ef-fect disappears with larger text samples.
Table 1provides an evaluation of Sukhotin?s algorithm onthe basis of Bible texts (NT) in our sample of 39languages.
The size of the corpora in Sassoon?ssample range from 1641 to 3781 characters whilethe Bible texts contain more than 100,000 char-acters (e.g., English has 716,301 characters).
Onaverage, Sukhotin?s algorithm classifies 95.66%of the symbols correctly.
However, this percent-age also includes those languages which do notfulfill the criterion of having a suitable phonemicwriting system (e.g., Russian, English, German,French).
When looking only at those languageswhose spelling systems are close to a phonemictranscription (or where the digraphs have been sub-65stituted by single symbols), the results are evenbetter.Misclassified symbols are either very infrequentand happen to occur next to symbols of the sameclass or are part of one of the digraphs used in thespelling system of the language.
In the Maltesecase, the symbol ?
is classified as a consonant be-cause it only occurs twice in the corpus in the wordelo?
where it stands next to a symbol that is clearlya vowel.
For some languages, minor modificationsto the original texts have been made in order to re-place the most frequent digraphs.
In Swahili, forinstance, with the official orthography the symbolc is classified as a vowel because it only occursin the digraph ch.
After the digraph has been re-placed by a single symbol, the classification is cor-rect in all cases.
Sometimes a symbol (e.g., h inWarlpiri) is misclassified because it does not occurin the writing system of the language but is part ofa digraph in foreign words (mostly proper namesof people or locations in the Bible texts).
Anotherproblem of the approach is with orthographies thatuse the same symbol for both vowels and conso-nants.
Since the classification is global, symbolslike English y, which is a consonant in yoghurtand a vowel in lady, are always treated as either avowel or a consonant for the whole language inde-pendent of the context where they occur.
There-fore symbols in the input text should always beable to be classified to one or the other category.As the discussion of misclassified symbolsshows, the main errors in the results are not due tothe algorithm itself, but a problem of the spellingsystems of the texts at hand.
Our results confirmthe findings of Sassoon (1992) that the algorithmis sensitive to the corpus size and the frequency ofoccurrence of individual symbols.
Larger corpora,such as Bible texts, yield much better results forthese languages.
Even those languages with manyand very complex consonant clusters (e.g., Geor-gian, Croatian and Czech) get an almost perfectclassification.
It is remarkable that the overall dis-tribution of the symbols makes up for those caseswhere consonants frequently occur in clusters.
Ex-periments with smaller corpus sizes also revealedthat one of the first symbols that get wrongly clas-sified is the sibilant s. This might be another indi-cator for the exceptional status of sibilants with re-spect to syllabification and their occurrence in con-sonant sequences where they can violate the sonor-ity principle (e.g., in the sequence str in words likestring the consonant s is to the left of the consonantt although higher in sonority).4 Unsupervised syllabificationBased the classification of input symbols into vow-els and consonants, the syllabification procedurecan then be applied.
Knowledge of syllable struc-ture is not only relevant for a better understand-ing of the procedures and representations that areinvolved in both computer and human languagelearning but also interesting from an engineeringstandpoint, e.g., for the correct pronunciation ofunknown words in text-to-speech systems or as anintermediate step for morphology induction.Several methods have been proposed in the lit-erature for an unsupervised language-independentsyllabification (see Vogel, 1977 for an overviewand Goldsmith and Larson, 1990 for an imple-mentation of a more recent approach based onthe sonority hierarchy).
Some methods that havebeen suggested in the literature (going back toHerodotus, who observed this for Ancient Greek;cf.
Kury?owicz, 1948) rely on the observationthat word-medial tautosyllabic consonant clustersmostly constitute a subset of word-peripheral clus-ters.
Intervocalic consonant clusters can thereforebe divided up into a word-final and word-initialcluster.
Theoretically, two types of problems canbe encountered.
First, those where more than onedivision is possible and second, those in which nodivision is possible.Several approaches have been suggested to re-solve the first problem, i.e., word-medial conso-nant sequences where there are several possible di-visions based on the occurrence of word-initial andword-final clusters.
O?Connor and Trim (1953)and Arnold (1956) suggest that in cases of ambigu-ous word-medial clusters the preference for onesyllable division over another can be determinedby the frequency of occurrence of different types ofword-initial and word-final clusters.
For this pur-pose, they determine the frequency of occurrenceof word-initial and word-final CV, VC, etc.
sylla-ble patterns.
Based on these frequencies they cal-culate the probabilities of dividing a word-medialsequence by summing up the values established forthe different word-peripheral syllable types.
Thecandidate syllabification with the highest sum isthen chosen as the optimal division.The approach taken here is a slight modificationof the proposal in O?Connor and Trim (1953) and66Language Vowels ConsonantsAfrikaans a c* e i o u y ?

All symbols of the inputBible texts for the respective languages are listed even if they are very infrequent.
For those languagesmarked as revised the most frequent digraphs have been replaced by a single symbol.
Wrongly classifiedsymbols are marked with an asterisk.
Languages with spelling systems which notoriously contain manyidiosyncratic rules are shaded.
We decided to include them as a reference where the problems occur withthese systems.67Arnold (1956).
Instead of counting the frequencyof occurrence of syllable types, the actual sylla-bles are counted in order to determine the best splitof word-medial consonant sequences.
An examplecalculation for the German word fasten ?to abstainfrom food?
is given in Table 2.a) fa st142]en [fast.en] sum: 142b) fa s528] [216t en [fas.ten] sum: 744c) fa[176st en [fa.sten] sum: 176Table 2: Example calculations for the word-medialcluster in the German word fasten.The example calculations in Table 2 show thatthe candidate syllabification in b) yields the high-est sum and is therefore chosen as the correct syl-labification of the word.
One of the advantagesof this approach (as well as the one proposed byO?Connor and Trim and Arnold) is that OMP fol-lows from the fact that word-initial CV sequencesare more frequent than word-final VC sequencesand does not have to be stipulated independently.The claim that CV is the unmarked syllablestructure for all languages of the world (andOMP auniversal principle) has been challenged by someAustralian languages that seem to behave differ-ently with respect to syllabification of VCV se-quences (Breen and Pensalfini, 1999).
In thoselanguages VCV sequences are syllabified as VC.Vinstead of V.CV, as OMP would predict.
Theauthors provide evidence from a number of pro-cesses in these languages (reduplication, languagegames) as well as historical and comparative evi-dence that support the analysis that VC seems to bemore accurate as the basic syllable type for thoselanguages.4For cases where word-medial clusters cannot bebroken up by sequences that are found at wordedges (bad clusters), we decided to go back to theoriginal method used by O?Connor and Trim andArnold and calculate the frequency of occurrenceof syllable types.
However, bad clusters are notvery frequent compared to the overall data in ourexperiments.One additional problem when working withwritten texts5 rather than transcribed corpora is the4Note that this does not invalidate one of the basic assump-tions of Sukhotin?s algorithm, since C and V still alternateeven though in the reverse order.5Some linguists also believe that stress can lead to a vio-lation of OMP by attracting an intervocalic consonant to thecoda of the previous stressed syllable.

for a subset of the lan-guages in the sample (in brackets the frequency ofadjacent occurrence).fact that diphthongs are not clearly distinguishedfrom sequences of monophthongs.
Yet this is vi-tal for a correct syllabification procedure since thenumber of syllables of the word is different de-pending on this choice.
In order to retrieve thediphthongs of the language from the distributionof vowel sequences in the corpus the following ap-proach has been used.6 For each bigram vowel se-quence the number of times the first vowel v1isdirectly followed by the second vowel v2is com-pared with the number of times both vowels areseparated by one consonant.
If the frequency ofdirect adjacency is higher than the frequency ofv1cv2the sequence is considered to be a ?diph-thong?
; if not, the sequence is considered to be acase of hiatus and both vowels are attributed to dif-ferent syllables.
Similar to Sukhotin?s algorithmthe present syllabification algorithm is also globalin the sense that the diphthong/monophthong dis-tinction is always used in the same way no matterin which environment the sequence occurs.7 Ta-ble 3 gives a list of the diphthongs extracted fromthe corpus for a number of languages in our samplebased on this method.4.1 The problem of evaluating syllabificationmethodsThere are several reasons why a gold standardfor syllabification, with which the syllabificationmethods are compared, is difficult to establish.not reflected in most orthographies, we do not consider thisoption here.6We thank Bernhard W?lchli (p.c.)
for drawing our atten-tion to this idea.7In German, for instance, the vowel sequence eu can eitherbe tautosyllabic and in that case constitute a diphthong as inheute ?today?
; or it can be a case of hiatus and therefore bebroken up by a syllable boundary as in Museum ?museum?.68Duanmu (2009) states that even for well-describedlanguages like English linguists do not agree on thecorrect syllabification of comparatively straight-forward cases.
For the English word happy, for in-stance, four different analyses have been proposed:[h?.pi] Hayes (1995), Halle (1998), Guss-mann (2002)[h?p.i] Selkirk (1982), Hammond (1999)[h?pi] Kahn (1976), Giegerich (1992),Kreidler (2004)[h?p.pi] Burzio (1994)Table 4: Analyses of happy (cited from Duanmu,2009).
Underlined consonants are ambisyllabic.The correct syllabification of a word can bestbe established when there is some operation in thelanguage that takes recourse on the syllable struc-ture of the word.
In the case of the Australianlanguages with no syllable onsets, Breen and Pen-salfini (1999:6f) provide evidence from reduplica-tion processes in Arrernte to support their analysis.If the Arrernte syllable shape is VC(C), rather than(C)CV, reduplication is most straightforwardly de-scribed in terms of syllables.
The attenuative pre-fix is formed by /-elp/ preceded by the first syl-lable of the base if VC(C) syllabification is as-sumed.
The attenuative form of the base empwa?
?to make?
is therefore empwelpempwa?.8 A simi-lar argumentation can be put forward for languagesthat show phonological operations that are basedon the structure of syllables, e.g., syllable-final de-voicing.
If a voiced obstruent is realized unvoiced,the syllabification might suggest its position to bein the coda.Besides disagreement on the correct syllabifi-cation of words, another crucial aspect of eval-uating syllabification methods is the question ofwhether the test set should consist of a randomsample of words of the language or whether thereshould be any constraints on the composition ofthe evaluation data.
If the evaluation consists ofa huge number of monosyllabic words, the resultsare much better than with polysyllabic words be-cause no consonant clusters have to be broken up.8As one reviewer remarked, reduplication patterns areusually described in terms of a CV-template rather than sylla-ble structures.
However, in the case of Arrernte, a descriptionin terms of syllables rather than VC(C) shapes would be moreelegant and at the same time account for other operations aswell.For the evaluation of their syllabification methods,Goldwater and Johnson (2005) distinguish wordswith any number of syllables from words with atleast two syllables.
Depending on the method thatthey test the differences in the percentage of cor-rectly syllabified words range from a few to almost30%.
It is therefore easier to get better results whenapplying the syllabification methods to languageswith a large number of monosyllabic words andfewer consonant clusters, like Mandarin Chinese,for instance.4.2 Discussion and evaluationOne of the problems of a cross-linguistic inves-tigation is the availability of gold standards forevaluation.
Thus, instead of providing a compara-tive evaluation, we want to discuss the advantagesand disadvantages of the procedure with respectto the more common sonority-based syllabifica-tion method.
We tested our method on a manuallycreated gold standard of 1,000 randomly selectedwords in Latin.
The precision is 92.50% and the re-call 94.96% (F-Score 0.94) for each transition fromone symbol to another.
Most misplaced syllableboundaries are due to the vowel cluster io, whichhas been treated as a diphthong by our method.The most interesting aspect of our approach isthat it is able to account for those languages whereintervocalic consonants are better be analyzed asbelonging to the previous syllable, thereby violat-ing OMP.
Approaches relying on the Onset Max-imization Principle would get al of these syllableboundaries wrong.
Breen and Pensalfini (1999)note that Arrernte also has only VC in word-initialposition.
Consequently, an approach that is basedon word-peripheral clusters can predict the lack ofword-medial onsets correctly.
The importance ofword-peripheral clusters is also supported by find-ings in Goldwater and Johnson (2005) where a bi-gram model improves after training with Expec-tation Maximization whereas a positional modeldoes not, which might be due to the fact that a bi-gram model (unlike the positional model) can gen-eralize whatever it learns about clusters no matterif they occur at word edges or word-medially.Moreover, the influence of word-peripheralclusters on the syllabification of word-medial con-sonant sequences is not restricted to syllable typesonly, but sometimes also holds solely for individ-ual consonants.
In Chamorro, for instance, Top-ping (1973) describes the syllabification of inter-vocalic consonants as observing OMP.
However,69this does not apply if the consonant is the glottalstop /?/, in which case the syllable division occursafter the consonant, leading to the syllabification/na?.i/ ?to give?.
The interesting observation in thisrespect is that the glottal stop phonologically neveroccurs at the beginning of a word in Chamorrowhereas all other consonants (with the exceptionof /w/) do occur word-initially,9 which leads to thecorrect syllabification results with our approach.Another advantage of the present method is thatclusters with sibilant consonants that do not con-form to the sonority principle (see the example ofstr in Section 3.3) do not have to be treated dif-ferently.
They merely follow from the fact thatthese clusters are particularly frequent in word-peripheral position.
The biggest disadvantage isthe fact that the method is sensitive to frequen-cies of individual clusters and thereby sometimesbreaks up clusters that should be tautosyllabic(one of the few examples in our Latin corpus wasteneb.rae).5 Conclusions and future workA complete model of syllabification involves morethan what has been presented in this paper.
Themethod proposed here is restricted to single wordsand does not take into account resyllabificationacross word boundaries as well as some other crite-ria thatmight influence the actual syllable structureof words such as stress and morphological bound-aries.
Nevertheless, the discussion of our approachshows that expanding the range of languages toother families and areas of the world can challengesome of the well-established findings that are usedfor inferring linguistic knowledge.The results of Sukhotin?s algorithm show thatthe distinction between vowels and consonants,which is vital for any syllabification method, canbe induced from raw texts on the basis of the sim-ple assumptions that vowels and consonants tendto alternate and that a vowel is the most frequentsymbol in a corpus.
In contrast to previous stud-ies of the algorithm (Sassoon, 1992), our resultsdo not suffer from the fact that the input text is tooshort and therefore yield better results.Based on the classifications of symbols intovowels and consonants with Sukhotin?s algorithmour unsupervised syllabification method deter-9Topping notes that phonetically there is a glottal stop pre-ceding every word-initial vowel, yet this is totally predictablein this position and therefore not phonemic.mines syllable boundaries on distributional infor-mation.
In contrast to other unsupervised ap-proaches to syllabification that are grounded on at-tributing a sonority value to each consonant andOMP, our procedure breaks up word-medial con-sonant sequences by considering the frequenciesof all possible word-peripheral clusters in order toget the most probable division.
We did not pro-vide a comparative evaluation of our procedure butonly discussed the problems that can be encoun-tered when looking at a wider variety of languagesand how they can be solved by our approach.
Thequestion that this paper wants to raise is thereforeif it is more important to optimize a procedure ona single language (mostly English or related Euro-pean languages) or whether it should be capable ofdealing with the variety of structures that can befound in the languages of the world.For future work we want to apply the presentmethods on phonetically transcribed corpora inorder to be able to compare the results for thewell-studied European languages to other meth-ods.
There are still some challenges remaining fora universal syllabification procedure, one of thembeing the detection of syllabic consonants.
Ulti-mately, we also want to integrate a sonority hier-archy of the input symbols to combine the advan-tages of both approaches and to create a gradualvalue for syllabification that is able to account forthe difference between clear-cut syllable bound-aries and ambisyllabic consonants or other caseswhere a syllable boundary is harder to establish.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been funded by the research ini-tiative ?Computational Analysis of Linguistic De-velopment?
