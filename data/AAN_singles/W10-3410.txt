minimar@ilsp.grAbstractWe report on a user needs investigation carried out in the framework of the pro-ject EKFRASIS1 that developed a plat-form for supporting authoring work in Modern Greek.
The platform had as a backbone a conceptually organised dic-tionary enhanced with rich lexicographic and morphosyntactic information.
Or-ganisation of information and encoding drew on Semantic Web technologies (on-tologies).
Users were all professional au-thors (of literature, editors, translators, journalists) working for well-established firms.
They were all familiar with printed conceptually organized dictionar-ies while most of them used a computer.
They were asked to specify how the plat-form would be helpful to them when they searched for a word for which they had only vague or few clues, a situation that was familiar to all of them.
Users preferred to have, in a first step, easy ac-cess to limited but to-the-point lexical in-formation while access to rich semantic information should be provided at a sec-ond step.
They were interested in rich lexical material although they were not really able to identify the relations that would help them retrieve it.
They strongly preferred an organization of ma-terial by concept and PoS and appreci-                                                 1 EKFRASIS  http://www.ilsp.gr/ekfrasi_eng.html was funded by the General Secretariat of Research and Technology / Greece.ated easy access to normative informa-tion.1 IntroductionWe present an investigation of user needs that was conducted in the process of developing a platform for supporting authoring work in Mod-ern Greek.
One main component of this platform is the dictionary ?EKFRASIS?
(literally ?expres-sion?).
EKFRASIS exploits technology and ideas developed for the Semantic Web (Guarino and Welty, 2002) to encode a conceptually organized dictionary enriched with translations as well as a wealth of lexicographic and morphosyntactic information.
The overall organisation of the dic-tionary and, partially of the platform, aims at helping the user who needs a word but has few clues or just guesses about it and about its way of use.
The interviewed users were all professionals: journalists, translators, editors and authors of literature.
In this survey, we aimed to map user expecta-tions concerning interaction with the dictionary rather than to look for appropriate ways for populating it.
Of course, some of the conclusions reached here may be useful for collecting lin-guistic material as well.2 The ?recollection problem?Authors (of any type of text) often find them-selves in the uncomfortable position whereby they remember or feel that the ?right?
word ex-ists but they can not recall it.
Here, we will call this situation the ?recollection problem?.
Alpha-betically organised dictionaries are of little help66in such situations.
Of course, the recollection problem is a well known one (for a discussion, see Zock and Bilac, 2004; Zock and Schwab, 2008).
Works with an international reputation have tried to face it and, of course, Roget?s The-saurus, a printed dictionary, and WordNet and EuroWordNet, both digital ones, spring easily to mind.
An interesting difference between the two dictionaries is exactly about the interaction with the user: while in Roget?s lexical relations are left implicit and material is explicit, in WordNet one has to go via lexical relations such as ?hy-ponymy?
and ?sister term?
to find the material.
In short, in Roget?s one is given the material di-rectly and no previous familiarity with taxono-mies is required while in WordNet one has to guess what taxonomic labels can offer in each case.
Furthermore, just finding a word is often not enough to guarantee confidence in its usage, so information provided by an assortment of rele-vant sources is indispensable.
Of course, printed dictionaries would expand to unmanageable vol-ume if they accommodated all necessary infor-mation, but digital dictionaries are not subject to such limitations.
For instance, Roget?s does not provide syntactic information but WordNet does.
Digital lexica that have been compiled for NLP purposes such as Acquilex (Briscoe et al, 1993) and Simple have tried to accommodate semantic, syntactic, morphological and pragmatic informa-tion structured in a principled way and make it available to machines.
In the Semantic Web era, efforts to better axiomatise the established re-sources have been made (Gangemi et al, 200; Old, 2004) as well as to combine detailed lin-guistic with ontological information for the pur-poses of Machine Translation (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004).
Such efforts were oriented to NLP mainly.
As regards human users, Roget?s success suggests that while wealth of material and good organisation of it matters, it is not necessary to present explicitly the relations among words in a ?concept?2 in order to provide a good solution to the recollection problem.
On the other hand, humans do instinctively look for words on the2 We use the term concept to define a set of words that are conceptually related.
Such sets are defined in Roget?s Thesaurus and the ?Onomasticon?.basis of domain relations several of which can be argued to mirror (aspects of) human cognition (Gaume et al, 2003; Kremer et al, 2008).
Fur-thermore, the data we will present here indicate that searching for a word is also a matter of habit and training, having a lot to do with one?s pro-fession and familiarity with certain types of dic-tionary.
As already said, we report on a user require-ment survey that was conducted in the frame-work of the project EKFRASIS.
Our aim was primarily to see how the lexicographic material should be presented to the user; however, we were also interested in fine-tuning our ideas about the nature of the material required.
We start with a brief presentation of the main ideas behind the dictionary EKFRASIS.
Next, we talk about how we organized the survey.
For each group of questions addressed to the users, we present and comment their responses.
Finally, we present our conclusions and decisions as re-gards the architecture of the dictionary EKFRA-SIS.3 About EKFRASISA few words about the dictionary EKFRASIS are in order to set the context of the survey dis-cussed in this paper.
EKFRASIS is a digital lexicon of Modern Greek (MG).
3  MG market makes available mainly alphabetically ordered printed dictionar-ies and, more recently, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms.
There is no dictionary of MG that combines lexicographic with semantic and mor-phosyntactic information.
There is one excellent thesaurus of Modern Greek, the ?Onomasticon?
by Theofilos Vostantzoglou, published back in 1962.
?Ono-masticon?
enjoys great reputation among Greek intellectuals.
T. Vostantzoglou drew a lot on Ro-get?s Thesaurus.
His material is organized in concepts and each concept is further structured into smaller groups of words.
Notably, he intro-duced certain innovations of his own: contrastive presentation of concepts, eg ?Joking?
and ?Speaking seriously?
are presented contrastively on the same page using a special format, short definition of groups of words that form a con-cept and information on style.
In addition, spe-3 It comprises 6000 entries at the moment.67cial attention is given to expressions and prov-erbs.
Links between concepts exist at lexical level introducing, in this way, relations among words in different concepts.
There is no actual typology of these relations which remain im-plicit to the user.
Very much like Roget?s, all the words in the conceptually organized part of the Onomasticon are also listed in alphabetical order in the second half of the book.
Each word is in-dexed for the set of concepts it belongs.
In EKFRASIS we understand ?conceptual?
organization as the result of the interplay of a set of domain relations.
In addition, EKFRASIS is planned to help with the usage of words by pro-viding definition of concepts, glosses and trans-lation of words, usage examples and full mor-phosyntactic information.
In our survey, we ex-posed the users to large amounts of information organized in more than one ways and asked them whether such a tool would be useful to them in their professional lives.
Throughout the present discussion, we ask the reader to keep in mind that we aim at developing a resource that would be of use to a wide audience.4 The SurveyAlthough the project EKFRASIS is addressed to anyone who writes in Modern Greek, we thought that professionals would have a clearer view of the authoring procedure and its needs.
Table 1.
Composition of the user group  Table 1 shows the composition of the user group.
Each group of professionals works under different conditions and has different require-ments.
In general, journalists and translators work under time pressure while authors of litera-ture and editors are more concerned with linguis-tic and aesthetic quality.
In the user group, au-thors, literature translators and editors are well known intellectuals of the country publishing with the publishing house ?Kastaniotis?
(http://www.
kastaniotis.com/), industrial translators work for a medium size firm ( http://www.orco.gr/ loc/frameset-gr.html?navbar-gr.html&0) and journalists work for the prestigious daily newspaper ?I Kathimerini?
(http://www.kathimerini.gr/).
Users were interviewed by teams of research-ers and?
each of the literature authors and editors were interviewed personally?
industrial translators and journalists were interviewed in groups according to their own requirement.To each person or group a presentation of the aims of the project was given and then, a spe-cially developed mock-up of a couple of usage cases of the authoring tool was presented.
We used a different mock-up (.ppt file) for each au-thor and editor and for each of the journalist and translator groups because EKFRASIS is a novel application by Modern Greek standards and, since no user had some relevant experience, ver-bal description would not help at all.
The presen-tations were followed by discussion and an in-terview that was taped and, finally, the users were asked to fill a questionnaire.
Each user (au-thor, editor, translator, journalist) filled in a separate questionnaire.
For the first part of the mock-up, pieces of text produced by each one of the authors, a piece of Greek translation from the site of Nokia and a piece from ?I Kathimerini?
were selected to de-velop the presentation that relied on the follow-ing scenario: hypothetically, when they devel-oped the particular text, the authors experienced the recollection problem and used EKFRASIS to find a couple of words.
They started their search with an input word of somehow related meaning to the intended one but not necessarily of the same PoS.
We present as an example extracts from the mock-up developed for one of the au-thors of literature.
In Figure 1 the author uses the noun mania as an input word.
EKFRASIS returns the names and definitions of all the concepts where the in-put word occurs (gray area on the left).
The con-cepts are not necessarily related to each other.
Here, the first one corresponds to ?proclivity, propensity?, the second to ?urge?, the third to ?mania?
as a disorder, the fourth to ?mania, pas-sion?, the fifth to ?fury?, the sixth to ?wrath?
and the seventh to ?love?.

This PoS comprises only one concept, so the system shows the box with the lexical material.
There is plenty of lexical material so the indica-tion ?more?
guides the user who would require access to more information.
Two series of user responses were elicited -- one with the questionnaire and one with the in-terviews.
The results of the interviews were not directly measurable but they greatly helped to clarify the picture.
In what follows we will pre-sent the measurable results but in the conclu-sions, we will draw on the interviews as well.
The questionnaire included different types of question (multiple choice questions, questions with graded answers, open questions).
In this report we are interested in the parts of the ques-69tionnaire on (i) the contribution of dictionaries and spelling checkers to authoring work (ii) how authors experience the recollection problem and (iii) efficient searching for words.5 Questioning the users5.1 Contribution of technology and dic-tionaries to authoring workWe first asked if professionals used computers and authoring aids.
Nearly 100% of users worked on a computer.
All users with the exception of journalists used general language dictionaries or specialized ones including dictionaries of synonyms (Table 2).
Journalists, on the other hand, seemed to pay attention mainly in word spelling.
Au-thors Edi-tors  Translators  Jour-nalists  To-tal Diction-aries (printed, digital)5 2 6 1 14Special diction-aries5 2 4 0 11Spelling checkers 0 0 2 4 6Table 2.
Usage of authoring aids  Why do users use dictionaries and spelling checkers?
We asked the users to give a yes/no answer to two contradictory statements.
So, to the statement ?I can find easily what I look for in dictionaries and spelling checkers?
all other us-ers and 2 journalists answered ?yes?.
However, to the opposite statement ?I can not find easily what I look for in dictionaries and spelling checkers?
no journalists replied while one editor and 3 authors replied ?yes?.
So, the picture is somehow messed up but in the overall it shows that people have formed expectations about dic-tionaries and look for certain types of informa-tion that they more or less find.
In addition, 1 editor, 4 translators, 3 authors and 4 journalists stated that dictionaries and spelling checkers speed up their work.
So, there is some kind of information in the dictionaries and the spelling checkers that helps and speeds up authoring work.
Certainly, these resources provide little help with the recollection problem.
So, in the next parts of the question-naire we set out to make clear what kind of in-formation users considered useful in the diction-aries and  what else they would like to find and how.
Mock-up presentations were of crucial help in this task.5.2 Experiencing the recollection problemWe asked how often and in which way users ex-perienced the recollection problem.
Users turned out to be quite familiar with experiences such as the following: (i) looking for a synonym (ii) en-tertaining the belief that a word exists but not being able to identify it (iii) having a general notion in mind but not being able to find words that ground it properly (Table 3).Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  TotalSynonym 1 2 6 5 14Heard in the past 0 2 6 5 13 General notion  4 1 6 5 16Other 0 0 0 3 3Table 3.
The recollection problem  It is clear that professional demands influence authoring behavior at work: authors of literature, editors and translators are more into searching for the appropriate word than journalists.
Ac-cording to the users, two are the main motives for searching words: (i) precision (ii) aesthetics (the example put forward by the users was the repetition of a word).
It is also interesting that the answers already point to some important lexical relations, namely synonymy and hypernymy / hyponymy,   which can be used for both constructing and navigating a resource (and have been used in many diction-aries, for instance in WordNet).5.3 Searching for lexical informationDespite the fact that answers such as ?heard in the past?
and ?general notion?
(Table 3) indicate that a variety of semantic relations can be used for searching for a word, it was not easy for the users to imagine which those relations would be.
This became obvious because?
users were able to fill in the part of the questionnaire on searching only after they70had seen the mock-up that presented them with searching strategies other than al-phabetical listing?
although they had twice in the question-naire the opportunity to describe some way of searching for words other than the ones suggested in the mock-up (see be-low) they did not do it ?despite the fact that interviews lasted for about 2.00 hours each on the average.Although they did not identify alternative searching strategies, they in the overall wel-comed the possibility of using morphologically (Table 4) and pragmatically (Table 5) related words for dealing with the recollection problem.
The example given to the users for illustrating morphologically related words was the triple adopt->adoption->adopted.
The users were asked whether they would like the dictionary to ensure that such sequences would be automati-cally offered.Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total YES 2 2 8 2 14 NO 4 0 0 2 6 Table 4.
Morphological relations    A similar question was asked about domain relations with the following example: ?if you type in sell or seller or offer would you like to be given automatic access to buyer, client, con-sumer.
?Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total YES 5 2 6 4 17 NO 1 0 0 0 1 Table 5.
Domain relations  Of the relations named explicitly in the ques-tionnaire, synonymy turned out to be the most likely one to be used for helping with the recol-lection problem (Table 6).
Hypernymy/hyponymy (Table 7) and an-tonymy (Table 8) were in the overall considered less useful for the recollection problem than synonymy, but still a high percentage voted for them.Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total Often 2 2 8 3 15 Occa-sionally 4 0 0 2 6 Rarely 0 0 0 0 0 Never 0 0 0 0 0 Table 6.

Antonymy  Next, users were asked how they would like to see information presented (Table 9).
They were offered mock-ups of the following four choices:Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total ?
4 0 0 1 5 ?
0 1 2 1 4 C 2 1 4 1 8 D 0 0 2  2 4 Table 9.
Presentation of information (a)?
A.
All linguistic material pops up in strict alphabetical order only (no PoS or seman-tic classification)?
B.
Only the linguistic material in the same PoS as the input word pops up in alpha-betical order71?
C. All linguistic material pops up in the form of a semantic tree4 together with PoS information?the tree reflects the concep-tual organization of the dictionary?
D. Only the part of the tree that belongs to the PoS of the input word pops upIn fact, options A and C are opposed to op-tions B and D in that the first pair offers imme-diate access to the whole lot of the related lexical material while the second pair only to the se-mantically related words in the same PoS with the input word---practically, its synonyms.
In Table 9.a.
we sum the answers according to this division.
While the A&C option was preferred by 62% of the users, the fact that a good 38% has chosen the B&D option had to be taken into account.Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total ?&C 6 1 4 2 13 ?&D 0 1 4 3 8 Table 9.a.
Presentation of information (b)  A compromising solution to this split of re-quirements is to present first the minimal neces-sary information, practically the synonyms of the input word, and then allow users navigate through the whole lot of it.
Organisation of information in the form of a ?semantic tree?
seems more popular than simple alphabetical presentation of material.
Still, some users prefer information to be pre-sented as it always had, in alphabetical order, without any other complication.5.4 More information of interestJour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total Often 1 2 2 4 9 Occ/ly 1 0 4 0 5 Rarely 4 0 2 1 7 Never 0 0 0 0 0 Table 10.
Expressions4 ?Semantic tree?
is a description of the situation in Figure 2 where words are organized in concepts indi-cated with the labels on the left hand column).The recollection problem concerns both one word units and expressions or collocates as is clearly indicated in Table 10 and Table 11.
The question asked here was ?How often do you look for an expression / a collocate??.
We must note here that, ahead of its time, Onomasticon puts special emphasis on both types of information.
Usage examples (Table 12) were requested mainly by translators and authors while glosses (Table 13) turned out to be of me-dium interest.Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total Often 1 1 6 3 11 Occ/ly 5 1 0 0 6 Rarely 0 0 2 2 4 Never 0 0 0 0 0 Table 11.

Glosses  On the other hand, users were interested in in-flection (Table 14) and spelling (Table 15) in-formation, as well as ?the right context of usage?
(Table 16) of words or expressions.Jour-nalists  Edi-tors  Trans-lators  Au-thors  Total Often 4 1 4 4 13 Occ/ly 0 0 2 1 3 Rarely 2 1 2 0 5 Never 0 0 0 0 0 Table 14.
Inflection72This comes as no surprise because Modern Greek reflects the long history of the language in several, often confusing ways:?
by providing more than one spellings for a word, eg ??????
/ ?????
(mixture)?
by being heavily inflected with many types for the same set of PoS and gram-matical features, eg??????
?, ?????
?, ???????
eat ?
3rd, plural, past continuous  Furthermore, the different forms are related with different styles, for instance in the example above the first form is considered the standard and the last the colloquial one.Jour-nalistsEdi-tors %Trans-lators  Au-thorsTotalOften 3 0 6 1 10 Occ/ly 1 0 0 1 2 Rarely 1 2 2 2 7 Never 0 0 0 0 0 Table 15.

Right context of usage  Naturally, editors need the particular facilities less than the other groups given their specialty.6 Conclusions and decisionsThe professional occupation of the users seemed to determine the kind of available au-thoring aids they preferred.
This may be due to the fact that they work under serious time pres-sure.
However, they too experienced the recol-lection problem and would take advantage of domain relations to solve it.
Editors require the least normative and usage information.
Authors and translators seem to appreciate all types of information.
Translators also stressed that effi-cient presentation of information is important, probably because they use translation aids regu-larly.On the basis of the questionnaire and the inter-views, we conclude that the features of the dic-tionary that would be attractive to the majority of users are:?
Easy access to limited but to-the-point lexical information: the most usable synonyms and the most useful derivatives?
Access to rich semantic information must be provided to those interested, al-though at a second step.
Users are more interested in the lexical material than the labeling of semantic relations?
Categorisation of lexical material by PoS.
The PoS of the input word pops up first but all the other PoS in the same con-cept are available?
Easy access to normative information given the particularities of Modern Greek in morphology and syntaxOn the basis of the above general conclusions, EKFRASIS interface design would satisfy the following minimum requirements:?
All concepts to which an input word be-longs are shown at the first step of the search,  together with the synonyms of the word in each concept?
Once a concept is selected, all existing sub-concepts are presented?
If no sub-concepts exist, all PoS in a con-cept are made available to the user who sees the concept definition and the set of synonyms for each PoS (if they exist)?
Once a word is selected all material about it pops up: gloss, example of usage, lexi-cal relations, inflection, syntactic proper-ties, collocations, translationFigure 5 is an extract from a mock-up where the hypothetical user has retrieved the multiword expression ?????

?bring to light?.
In-formation given includes: gloss, synonyms (?present?, ?give away?, ?make something visi-ble?, ?make something obvious?
),  inflection in-formation (concerning tense formation) and hints on its the usage.
Users agreed that for each word an exhaustive summary of its properties should be provided.73??????????
