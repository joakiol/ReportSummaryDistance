ON THE SPATIAL USES OF PREPOSITIONSAnnette HerskovltsL ingu is t i cs  Department, Stanford UniversityAt f i r s t  glance, the spat ia l  uses of prepositions seemto const i tu te  a good semantic domain for  acomputat ional  approach.
One expects such uses w i l lre fe r  more or less s t r i c t ly  to a closed, exp l i c i t ,  andprec i se  chunk of world knowledge.
Such an at t i tude  Isexpressed in the fo l lowing statement:"Given descr ip t ions  of the shape of two objects, giventhe i r  l ocat ion  ( for  example, by means ox coordinates inSome system of reference),  and, In some cases, thelocat ion  of  an observer, one can select an appropriateprepos i t ion .
"This paper shows the fa l lacy  of this claim.
Itaddresses the problem of interpret ing and generating" locat ive  pred icat ions"  (expressions made up of twonoun-phrases governed by a preposit ion used spat ia l ly ) .It i dent i f ies  and describes a number of ob jectcharacter i s t i cs  beyond shape (section I) and contextualfac tors  (sect ion 2) which bear on these processes.Drawing on these descr ipt ions,  the th i rd  sectionproposes core meanings for two categories ofp repos i t ions ,  and describes some of the t rans for~t tonsthese core meanings are subject to in context.
The lastsec t ion  out l ines  the main d i rect ions of Inquirysuggested by the examples and observations in thepaper.1.
~BJECT CHARACTERISTIC~Throughout the paper, I use the term "object ~, meaning,s t r i c t ly  speaking, the object together with somelextca l  label .
In e f fec t ,  the choice of preposit iondepends on the l ex ica l  category  associated with theob jec t  by the noun-phrase used to refer to I t .
And sucha category  i s  not un ique ly  defined.
There are d i f fe rentl eve ls  In the categor i za t ion  hierarchy (e.g.
"endtab le" ,  " tab le" ,  "p iece  of fu rn i tu re ' ) ,  but a l sod i f fe rent  perspect ives  on the object .
Consider thep ic ture  below.,~, , ~ ,That patch of  grass could be referred to a l ternate ly  asa front.yard, a larun, grass, a patch of pass, etc.
(to assumethat  these phrases re fe r  to the sane object, one mustsee the grass as a metonymlc subst i tu te  for  tMs patcA ofgrass, and the front.yard as some "area" ra ther  than a"s l i ce"  lnc lud ln~ a i r  above and ground under; neitherview is unreasonable).
The permissible prepositions,and the i r  in terpreta t ion ,  vary with each re fe r r ingphrase: compare in/on the ~ass, ~nion tA~ patcA of ~as~, inK*on)tan front.~:rd, onl(*~n) the /reran \ [F i l lmore 1971\].
With thiswarn ing ,  I w i l l  go on speaking of "objectcharacter i s t i cs ' ,  "object  ident i ty" ,  etc.Some of  the ob ject  character i s t i cs  used in productionand in terpreta t ion  can be computed from the shape ofthe ob jec ts  - -  the axes of symmetry (needed for across tanroad and along tan ro~d), the "top sur face"  (on t&e label), the~out l lne"  (tA, #ird in t~ tree), etc.
(for a descr ip t ion  ofsome of these characteristics, and of their role Incomprehension, see \[Boggess 1979\]).Other character i s t i cs  are not deducible from shape.These include:1.
1, ALTERNATE GEOM~'I'RIC DESCRIPTIONSObjects  ident i ca l  in shape may be "conceived md i f fe rent ly ,  for  instance as surface or as enclosure.This may be a choice avai lable to the speaker toemphasize cer ta in  aspects (inlon t~$e rug), or I t  may bedetermined for  the category of the reference object (ontAe football f ield).In under t/te aJater, the water stands for tAe upper free surfaceof tAn ruater; in in the water, i t  .is conceived as a volume.
Awhole category of objects fol lows this rule: see(undtr l ln)  tan (snowllakeloceanlsan41.).
Such objects tend to beviewed only as volumes with "underneath': undcrn~A fatlake i s  genera l ly  interpreted as meaning "under thelower surface of that  body of water'.In tan crack In tan 6~wl, the crack Is In the volume definedby the normal surface of the bowl in I ts  uncrackeds ta te .
In tan milk in tat bowl ,  the milk Is In the volumeenclosed by the bowl and l imited upward by a plonethrough the rim.1.2.
FUNCTIONOne says in ran disk and on the tray though these objects uybe essent ia l l y  Ident ica l  in shape.
One w i l l  noto rd inar i l y  say tan cat Is in :At t~e,  but un~r tan t~e,  evenw i th  the cage- l i ke  table below./oAn is et X Often means that  John Is using I as onenormal ly  uses i t  (JoAn is at his desk).
I f  normal useimp l ies  being on or m X, then at Is not used (John is inor on the bed, but not at).
And to the right of the chadr Isde f ined  by reference to a typical  user of the chair.1.3.
TYPICAl, PHYSICAl, OR GEOMETRICAL CONTEXTWhen using in with areas, i t  Is not su f f i c ient  that there ference object  be two-dimensional; that object mustbe par t  of  a surface divided into cel ls .
One does notdraw a l ine  in a blackboard; but in tat nlargin is acceptable,because the margin is a subdivision of a page.
In thesame fashion, ' geograph ica l  areas (England, tat county,etc . )
are sect ions of a divided surface.
Some objectsare exc lus ive ly  conceptualized as parts of a "cel ls t ruc ture"  and cannot then fol low at (*at his room, *atEngland).
Other  objects can be conceptualized both aselements of a ce l l  s t ructure (in the village), or as one ofa set of  separate  places (at tat ~illage).
Or consider ~ard:when 1~ is a part  of the grounds of a house, one isres t r i c ted  to In.
But of somebody working In a Junkyard,one could say he is at the )?rd, re f lect ing  a view of theyard  as one of  a set of separate locations.I f  a door is in i t s  typical  context, i .e.
part of awal l ,  then in terpretat ion  of  m tk~ right of Me d~r must bebased on the door ' s  own axes.
Otherwise ( In a hardwares tore  fo r  example) an observer ' s  l ine  of s ight  myover r ide  the door ' s  c ross -ax is .1.4.
RELATIVE MOBILITYThe mob i l i ty  of  the reference ob ject  re la t ive  to thelocated  ob jec t  in f luences  the order of the nominalsa round the prepos i t ion :  the more mobile ob ject  normal lyprecedes  the prepos i t ion .
One wi l l  not say t/ur ~&,n~ bot~ti~ tam one in a cap, but tke one ~dk a ~p on it.
Following Tally(1978a\ ] ,  I will call the l ocated  object  the "F igure" ,and the  re ference  ob jec t  the "Ground", when discuss ingthe  order  of  the nominals.Human beings tend to  p lay  havoc wi th  the re la t ivemob i l i ty  ru le ,  e i ther  because  they  are  the pre fer redtop ic  (flee man i~ a Nu~ coat), or - -  as center of  theun iverse  - -  p re fer red  reference ob ject  (tke EmpOe 3t~ebuilding i~ in front of me).Typ ica l i ty  p lays  an i lpor tant  ro le  in deter l ln lng  anappropr ia te  locat ive  pred icat ion  (and no doubt othertypes  o f  express ions) .
The choice of  expression tendsto  depend not on par t i cu la r  (non prototyp ica I )a t t r ibutes  of  the ob jects  considered, but rather  ontyp ica l  a t t r ibutes  of  the  category to  which they areass igned by the l ingu is t i c  expression.
I f  typ ica lcond i t ions  do not  obta in ,  they tend to be ignored,un less  one has so le specia l  reason to br ing a t tent ionto  the a typ ica l  cond i t ions .

VARYING V|EWPO\[NT ON THE OBJECTMa in ly  th i s  Invo lves  the cont ras t  between a close-upand a remote view of  the ob jects .
Most of ten ,  th i s  isnot  a Bat ter  o f  ac tua l  d is tance,  but s way of  viewingan ob jec t  fo r  a g iven purpose: one Jay choose to ignoreone or  more dimensions, or ln terna l  character i s t i cs  ofthe  ob jec t .
For example, a road uy  be seen as a s t r ip(a truck On tke ro?d), or a l i ne  (a oUlateon Mr ro~L~don) .Normal ly  beMnd tar kouJt v i i i  be based on the house's ownaxes.
But  when l ook ing  from some distance,  one My useone 's  l ine  of  s ight  as  ax is .Another  aspect  o f  v iewpo int ,  is the bounded/unboundedd is t inc t ion .
Compare w~ng f~rougk versus across the ~at~\[Talmy 1978b\]:  in the former the boundaries of the bodyo f  water  are  Ignored,  but in the la t te r ,  the extensiono f  the body of  water  from one end to another isi nvo lved .2 .4 .

I f  funct ion  is there levant  aspect ,  i t  Is  of  no In teres t  to d i s t ingu ishbetween s i tuat ions  where bulb and socket are as above,and the i r  ups ide down vers ions.

And cer ta in ly  adequate lOdels oflanguage should account for  th is  poss ib i l i ty .A locat ive  expression may describe the generalin tent ion  of a per}on over some time, rather than hisp rec i se  locat ion  at the tlme of speaking.
I could sayL~nn is.at.t~e store even if l knew .Lynn might still be onher way.
But th is  may not be appropriate (e.g.
i f  Iknow the addressee is at the s tore ) .Relevance is important for Grlcean inferences.
Forinstance, from /on is near his desk, one can generally inferi on  t~ not at his desk.
I f  however I asked a fr iend on thephone "are you near your desk?
could you look up theaddress .

,  an appropriate answer is "yes", even if myf r iend  is at  h is /her  desk.
In ~hls context proximity isthe re levant  aspect, and "near" becomes appropriate.2.5.
SALIENCEThe book below le f t  is on the table, the l id  (r ight) isnot,  because the intervening re lat ion between the l idand the jar is salient.
Such salience Is not primarilya umtter  of the size of some intervening object.~#.book  ~5 ' l~ l idOne genera l ly  says that  X is tn eke field and in the ~mi,whenever field or bowl contain X.
One ~ay however saythe dust on the ~ml, and the fertilizer on the ~eid.

HIGHLIGHTING SOME BACKGROUND ELEMENTThe choice between expressions is often a matter ofb r ing ing  attention to some.
background element ratherthan s igna l l ing  d i f ferences of fact.
Thus to tke right, ascont ras ted  with on the rigM, tends to highl ight thed i s tance  between the two objects, and to evoke travelaway from the reference object; the contrast cannotalways be described in terms of objective dif ferencesin the situations ( i t  sometimes is: thus i f  a th i rdob jec t  of the same kind Is between the two considered,only  to the right is appropriate).
And on the right side of thebu~lW~ng as contrasted with on the rigkt ~ the b~l~ng bringsat tent ion  to the wal l .
Consider also Bogota is melon theequator; "a t "  will be preferred I f  one wishes to signalthe presence of some transverse l ine (e.g.

INDETERMINACYMost spat ia l  re la t ions  are true given a certa into lerance.
The tolerance has a lower l im i t  defined bythe nature of the objects; i t s  e f fect ive  value dependson one's purpose, and the precision of one's knowledge.Thus, the angular precis ion with which ~r~tly to the ~gMi s  def ined var ies with si lverware on the table, chesspieces on a board, or houses on a block.2.8.
CONTRAST"Po lar  concepts", i .e.
terms like to the ngkG may behavel lke imp l i c i t  comparatives.
In some sense, to the right isbet ter  rea l i zed  the closer the located object is to the" r ight  axis".
Thus, i f  I said put the ckair to the righ!
of tkedesk, I would expect you to put it more or less on ther lght  ax is  of the desk.
And, in the f igure below, A ls totAe right of B only in the absence of C. The location of Amust be contrasted with that of similar objects in there levant  part of space.
(One could however say here: A ls to the right and behind B, orA is ~agonally to the right of B.
This suggests that even inthe presence of C, A is to the algae of B is true, but"uncooperat ive"  \[Grice 1974\].
However, It is"uncooperative" precisely because of some intrinsicproper ty  of the concept to the right - -  l .e.
because".closer to the axis" is in some sense a better way tOrea l i ze  to the right.
Even I f  one grants some usefulness tothe semantic/pragmatic distinction, i t  does not neatlyapply here.
)A similar use of contrast  can be seen with the ch.,~r is Inthe corner in the f igure below.
I t  is not appropriateunless the armchair be removed.,@.-.cha i rThe concept of a "corner" has bu i l t  In that In the cornerbecomes less appropr iate as one gets further from thevertex itself,2.

(~THERSMany uses of  the preposit ions cannot be explained interms of any of the above factors.
One then needs adescr ip t ion  of the context of use at a rather specif icleve l .
Consider for  example the contexts in which onewill say Suzy is at the playground versus in the playp'ound.
Inwould be ( i )  preferred i f  the  speaker can see Suzy,( i l )  required I f  the addressee expects Suzy to be Justouts ide  the playground, ( t i t )  required i f  the speakerher /h imse l f  Is in the playground (an analogous contrastex i s ts  between at the be~k and on the beach).
Thesecond i t ions  "suggest" a close-up view, and that thespeaker 's  knowledge is precise; by contrast, "at"suggests  a remote view, and imprecise knowledge.
But" to  suggest" is not to imply: one cannot infer thesecond i t ions  of use from the ideas of a remote versus ac lose-up view.3.
COR~ MEANIN~With most of the examples given, the explanationsuggested fo r  the choice of a preposition assumes theex is tence  of  a "core meaning".
This core meaning isbas ica l ly  a geometrical relat ionship betweengeometr ica l  ent i t ies .
Thus, in a given context,"geometr i ca l  descr ipt ions"  (say a point, l ine, surface,volume, lamina, etc . )
are mapped onto the subject andobject of the preposition.
Strictly speaking, the coremeanings are -- at best -- true only of these geometricdescr ip t ions .
In fact ,  they may not even hold for anysuch geometric descr ipt ion - -  see the pear in ?
~mlexample above, assuming the natural core meaning for" lne ,  i .e .  "
inc lus ion" .
Yet, the core meaning is thenpresent  as "prototype".Here are informal de f in i t ions  of the core meanings fortwo categories of prepositions, designated as" topo log ica l "  (at.
on.
in),  and "project ive"  (to the right,be~nd, etc . )
.Topo log ica l  prepos i t ions:in: par t ia l  inc lus ion  of a geometr i ca l  construct in avo lume,  an area ,  or a l ine .on: cont igu i ty ,  ad jacency  of a geometr i ca l  const ructw i th  a sur face ,  or a l ine .~:  co inc idence  of  a po in t  with a po int  in space.In actua l  context ,  inc lus ion,  cont igu i ty ,  andco inc idence  need not be true.
Thus the book on top of ap i le  of  books on the table  can be said on tie ta~e, andMar~ ts eJ the gate when very close to It.
But the re la t ionsrepresent  the " idea l "  around which par t i cu la r  instancesgrav l ' ta te .
Thus at Impl ies the c losest  reasonablere la t ionsh ip  between two objects,  and coincidence wheresens ib le  (tie cent~oftke drclems attkeint~s~t~onoftke axe).
Ofcourse,  the core meanings are not su f f i c ient  todetermine  the cond i t ions  of use of a given preposi t ion:one must a lso  know prec ise ly  which deviat ions from theidea l  are permit ted.
One pr inc ipa l  process Jed lat tngbetween core meanings and actual condit ions of use Isthe  mapping o f  ob jects  onto points,  surfaces, andvolumes.I am not  saying that  the core meanings presented hereare  the only  poss ib le  ones.
Only when core meanings areIncorporated  in a global  explanatory system wi l l  I t  beposs ib le  to make r igorous arguments for  a l te rnatecho ices .
Those proposed here represent a good s tar t ingpo in t .P ro jec t ive  prepos i t ions :Each o f  these prepos i t ions  involves - -  through fact ,suppos i t ion ,  or metaphor - -  a "po int  of observat ion ' ,  kpo in t  of  observat ion  consists of two vectors, oneInd icat ing  the intrinsic ver t i ca l  of the observer  (itwi l l  not  be the grav i ta t iona l  ver t i ca l  I f  the observerI s  l y ing  down, or  not In the grav i ta t iona l  f ie ld ) ,  andthe o ther  orthogonal  to the f i r s t  along the l ine  ofs ight .
These two vectors completely speci fy fourcop lanar  or tho$ona l  ha l f - l ine  axes associated with thepo in t  o f  observat ion :  the " f ront" ,  " r ight" ,  "back", and" le f t "  axes ,  in c lockwise  order .In the core meaning de f in i t ion  of these preposit ions,re fe rence  and located objects  are points.
Given a po into f  observat ion ,  one can speci fy  axes aSSOCiated withthe re ference  ob ject  - -  the "base axes" ( r ight ,  l e f t ,front, and back) by re ference  to which to the ri~w,kt, be~nd,etc .
,  w i l l  be def ined.
These axes or ig inate  at there fe rence  ob ject .
If the point  of observation (PObs)co inc ides  w i th  the reference object  (PRef) ( f igure Abe low) ,  the base axes are Ident ica l  to those of  thepo in t  o f  observat ion .
I f  the point  of observation Isaway from the reference object  ( f igure B), the baseaxes  are  a mi r ro r  iMge  of those of the po int  ofobservat ion  - -  the  mtzror  p lane being the b i sector  ofthe  segment jo in ing  point of observation to referenceob jec t .f rom/pRef!e f t4=' i l~ '~ r ightbmCk~pot~ sba~//P"" fDef t@r ightfr?ntBThere are thus two poss ib le orders of the base axes, asshown In A and B.I wl l l  def ine  the core meaning of each pro jec t iveprepos i t ion  as fo l lows:  given a punctual referenceob jec t  (PRef), punctual located object  (PLoc), and apo in t  o f  observat ion ,  base axes can be constructedaccord ing  to the procedure out l ined above: PLoc Is to tieleft.
of  PRef i f f  i t  i s  located  on the le f t  base ax is .Analogous d~f in i t ions  for  the other preposit ions areeasy  to fo rmulate .A few examples w i l l  help understand how these co'remeanings are  man i fes t  in the actua l  uses of theprepos i t ions .In in fremt of a r~ling st~me, the point of observation Is"vlrtual"-- l.e.
It Is an hypothetical locatlon anddirection for vlewlng: the location is coincident withthe stone,, and the direction Is the direction ofmovement.
One must of course assume - -  as with theob jec ts  In tit= examples that fo l low - -  that the stoneI s  as lmi la ted  to a point.In to tie ~gkt of tle char, the base axes may be spec i f ied asthose in t r ins ic  to the cha i r  -o I .e .
by reference to atyp ica l  user.
The point  of observation is thenco inc ident  w i th  the reference object  o- namely thecha i r .
Coincidence may be the case when the base axesare  not  In t r ins ic  to the reference object:  for  Instanceon the ri\[M of the sto0/ lay be def ined with respect tosomebody s i t t ing  on i t ,  given a round stool with noin t r ins ic  f ront  ax is .Reference ob jec t  and po int  of observation are separatedIn  the moon ~kind the clou~\[.
They can also be separated whenthe  base  axes  are  in t r ins ic  to the re ference  ob jec t :wlth on t~ r i \ [kt side of tle closet, the point  of observation Isde f ined  by a typ ica l  user facing the c loset .Again,  one might def ine  the core meanings d i f fe rent ly .In .par t i cu la r  one could def ine  the core meaning of " tothe  r ight"  say, as implying locat ion  In the wholer ight -hand ha l f - space  instead of on the axis.
Thecho ice  adopted here re f lec ts  the fact  noted In ear l ie rexamples that  the " idea l "  rea l i za t ion  of to the ngkt iswith the located ob jec t  on the right base axis.Processes o ther  than the mapping of objects onto pointsmay mediate between core meanings and actual condit ionso f  use.

SOME CONCLUS|( .
'SHere are the main problels and directions of inquirysuggested by the examples in this paper.One cannot fu l l y  expla in the use of a locat ivepred icat ion  in a given s i tuat ion  in terms of the coremeanings together  wi th  some inferences from generalp r inc ip les  invo lv ing  ob ject  knowledge, sal ience,re levance ,  the  prec is ion  des i red ,  etc.
There w111always remain uses involving some degree ofarbitrariness (most uses are "motivated", I f  not"compositional" \[Flllmore Ig?9\] -- i.e.
the morphemescomposing the appropriate expression are normallyselected from "reasonable" candidates).
Even where suchprinciples are at play, they may operate not at thecomprehens ion/product ion  l eve l ,  but ra ther  a t  thephy logenet ic  leve l .
To sort pr incipled aspects of usefrom arb i t ra ry  ones, and to understand exactly wheresuch pr inc ip les  operate, one must of course f i r s testab l i sh  the i r  existence and nature.In te rms  o f  knowledge of the  phys ica l  world, I be l ieveone importan~ step.

That is ,I t  is  not enough - -  or even always necessary - -  to knowwhere what objects are; one must also consider how muchf i t s  in to  one f ie ld  of view, how th ings "appear" asopposed, to how they "are",  how this changes withviewing distance, v i s ib i l i ty ,  obstruction, etc.General p r inc ip les  of salience should ue studied: howsome ob ject  parts or re lat ions  are selected as mostimportant  - -  e i ther  in a l l  imaginable contexts, or insome contexts .
Salience underlies many Instances ofmetonymy (in at t~e front of tAe t~atre, "theatre" actua l lyre fe rs  to the part  occupied by the audience).Many'quest ions revolve around the issue of "relevance"- -  of "what matters, to whom, in what circumstances"ra ther  than the t rad i t iona l  concern with what is true.A l l  ex i s t ing  ar t i f i c ia l  Inte l l igence programs haveignored th i s  problem by using a l imited vocabulary In al im i ted  domain, so that the question of selectingre levant  utterances never arises.Relevance is l inked to the speaker's purpose, as unyo f  the contextual  factors  described in this paper - -indeterminacy,  Gricean inferences, highl ighting ofbackground elements, determination of the Figure/Groundre la t ionsh ip ,  etc.
The set of "expressible" 8oals isconst ra ined  by the "potent ia l "  of the language, i .e .
bya semantic system with f in i te ly  many options.
One canonly  want to say what can be said, and said in areasonab le  amount of time.
Clear ly ,  "planning" fornatura l  language process ing  is  a very Importantproblem.Purpose however, w i l l  not explain everything one says.Simple assoc ia t ive  mechanisms must sometimes berespons ib le  for  what one says.
For instance, somebackground element may be highlighted - -  provided Somel inguist ic  means to do so exists  - -  only because somepassive assoc ia t ive  l ink has brought i t  to attent ion.Once general pr inc ip les  are better understood, I t  Is anopen quest ion whether they are used by speakers, orwhether the i r  explanatory power Is at the phyiogenettcleve l  (and w i l l  thus be only Impl ic i t  in the structureo f  the knowledge representation).
For instance,a l though there is a general pr inc io le  that  the locatedob jec t  should be more mobile than the reference object,product ion may not proceed by inferences from thisgeneral  p r inc ip le  together with scenarios Involving thetwo objects .
The l ingu is t i c  expression (or pattern forexpressions)  may be attached to some representation ofa "s i tuat ion  type" invo lv ing  the two objects (or twosuperord inate  objects) .
And although "at" generallyimpl ies  the c losest  reasonable relat ionship between twoob jec ts ,  such a de f in i t ion  may never be used by aspeaker - -  or used only In the creation orunderstanding of novel types of expressions, metaphors,w i t t i c i sms ,  etc.What speakers do, and what conputer models ofcomprehension and production processes should be madeto do, are two d i f fe rent  things: the la t te r  depends onthe const ructer ' s  goals, which should be subjected tosome scrut iny .A computational treatment of the use of prepositionsw i l l  require much greater sophist icat ion than naiverepresentat ion  theory would lead us to expect.REFERENCESBoggess, Lois C. 1979.
