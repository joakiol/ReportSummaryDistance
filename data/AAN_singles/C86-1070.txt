LINGUISTIC DEVELOPNENTB IN EUROTRA SINCE 1983.Lieven OaspaertKatholieke Universiteit  Leaven (Belgium)I wish to put the theory and metatheory currentlyadopted in the Eurotra project (ArnoO6) into ahistor ical  perspective, indicating where and whychanges to i ts  basic design for a transfer-based MT(TBMT) system have been made.Let T. be some theory of representation, inducingsets of representations R~ and Rt for languages L,,and L~ (seen as sets of texts), respectively.Transfer-based translation is described as follows:ANTRFR~ ~ .

L~TRAwhere AN, BEN and TRF are binary relations, and TRAis the composition of AN, TRF and GEN, i.e.interpretation was to be expressed as an orberedtree with complex property l i s t s  on the nodes, whichwas manipulated by two basic operations, viz.
treetransformations and lexical substitut ion.
The BETApreoccupation with robustness, on the other hand,made them require that all linguistic informationabout texts should be merged into one single gds.
Onfailure to compute parts of a deeper linguisticdimension, the intuition went, some clever algorithmcould be used to extract from the gds an equivalentpiece of representation on the next less pretentiousdimension.
The logical extreme of this reasoning wasthat, if all else failed, it should be possible torecover the original text from the gds.Grenoble, however, had perceived the usefulness ofdependency theory (DT) for TBNT.
"\[here is a sense inwhich DT is a lex ica l ly  oriented theory of language,and, in the end, translation is a question ofgetting the right translation for words.Nevertheless, the marriage between DT and the gdsdesign led to (I) procrustinated linguistics, and(2) a formalism with untractable semantics.
(i) AN ~ L~ x R,~, GEN ~ R~ x L~, TRF s R~ x R~( i i )  TRA = AN o TRF o GENWe also need to introduce two parameters, viz.hypotheses about T .. A theory (e.g.
for the ANrelation) is m ultistratal when It consists of a setof subtheories {tl,t2,...,tn}, each characterising aset of representation R,, such thati.i.

Rather, thewhole burden of modularising the relation betweentext and representation was put on the translationof the relation into a procedure: discussions aboutnever brought to hear.

xOtherwise, a theory is monostratal,A theory T is mult!_dim_ebsional when descriptions oflinguistic objects along several linguisticdimensions are merged into one singlerepresentational mbject.
The notion of linguisticdimension is meant to correspond to some organisingprinciple for a theory of representation (e.g.constituency, grammatical relat ions, logicalsemantics, ate.l.
Otherwise, a theory ismonodimensional.In what follows we describe the various Eurotraapproaches to TBMT in terms of this basi~ model,Initially, due to i t s  BETA inheritance, Eurotraadhered to a monostratal multidimensional model forTBMT.
Computationally, it was based on the Grenobleformalism of the g~n~E~ateu_r d~._stEuctur~s (g.ds).L inguist ica l ly ,  i t  advocated a diluted form ofdependency theory as a basis for TBMT.The observation that theoretical linguistics hadbeen incapable of providing a practically applicablebasis for translation had led GrenoOle to buildalmost no linguistic commitment into the gdsformalism.
Every possible form of l inguist ic294.\]he innovation of \[Arno83\] was i ts  attempt to deriverequirements on T. from a set of more abstractprinciples, seen as a theory of MT providing aframework within which possible substantive theoriesfor TBMT could be devised and compared.
The weaknessof the framework was to seek to motivate the toolsinherited from BETA a-posteriori.
Its merit was tobe a partial theory of TBMT, independent of theinheritance.I ts major concern was directed at elucidating thedivision of labour between AN, TRF and OEN, and atderiving implications on T. from this understanding.The pivotal principles of the framework that havesurvived the many face lifts of the Eurotra modelare i soduidy_ and Q-d~E~D~.g!2 .The principle of isoduiy allowed for a principleddef in i t ion ,  in terms of properties of T,., of thedomain of the GEN relation of some language in termsof the nodomain of the AN relation for that samelanguage, thus indirectly defining .the TRF relation.The principle of O-differentiation required that T.should be su f f i c ient ly  expressive to ensure that allmeaning aspects of text that are relevant fortranslation (called 'Q') be represented in membersof R. The two principles together" provided a basisfor designing a transfer device that was (i)developmentally simple, and (2) Q-preserving.
Theseare necessary features of any multilingual TBMTsystem striving for good-quality translation.1.2.
~lultidimensior, al.Despite i ts  success in providing an in i t ia lframework for Eurotra, lame83\] fai led dismally wheni t  came to deriving from i t  a substantive l inguist icrepresentation theory.
The failure was not unrelatedto the absence of motivation for the GETA vestiges.The gds comprised a flat geometry and a richdecoration on the nodes.
Given the requirement ofmerging, th~ geometry for all dimensions (textstring, morphology, surface syntax, deep syntax,semantics) had to be very similar: this was onlypossible by making the geometry quite meaningless,and by put t ing  the whole expressive burden on thelabelling of nodes.
The need to preserve surfaceword order (robustness) gave geometry its onlyinteresting task: the representation of word orderthrough the ordering of sister nodes, Within amerged approach, this requirement led to thearbitrary interdependence of the subtheorios for thevarious linguistic dimensions.
The problem was mosttangible in the design of a subtheory of \]',, for asemantic dimension.
T~, became unnecessarily complexand inconsistent.
Given the absence of linguistic~ommitments built into the tools and the failure ofthe framework to answer substantive linguisticquestions, debates about the relative merits ofparticular representational choices woreinconclusive.We give an example of linguistic procrustination,Surface word order being represented by the order ofsister nodes in the merged tree (the gds), treegeometry was seen as ordered.
Tins geometry ofdependency representations, on the ether hand, arenormally unordered, Tile way out was a refashioningof DT as a compromise between DT and X-theory with asingle bar: a subset of the information about thegoverning node was lowered into the mdbtreerepresenting its dependents and to require that  thesubtree he ordered conforming to the position o~elements in the input text, lbi~ worked badly withall sorts of difficult linguistic phenomena:exocentr i ( :  constructions (e.g.
~onjuection),gapoing, discontinuity, long-distance dependencies,etc.
Much of the linguistic research, then, wasaimed at overcoming these problems in a principledway by means of a theory of empty elements.
Althoughthe latter was intuitively consistent, it causedsuch an increase in the complexity of the formalismthat the latter defied any coherent formalcharacterisation.The first design was, amongst other things, unableto flesh out the problem of robustness, Combining amuitidimensienal representation with a b~sically allpaths combinatorial algoritbm led to the inabi l i tyto rely on the actual computation of combinations ofinformation required by the safety net alorithm.The second deuign (which was never formally acceptedby the project) purported to solve this problem,without eliminating multidimeneion-alitv.
I t  wasmultistratal and multidimensional.2.1 .
Ru l t i s t r~ta l .It was observed that the representations induced byT,, had to meet two (possibly confl ict ing)requirements: (i) they had to have suff ic ientexpressive power to allow for adequate translationvia simple transfer, and (2) their computation hadto be feasible.
As a consequence, T. was split intotwo subtheories, T~ and T~, were the former wasdirected at the needs of adequacy for simpletransfer and the latter to the reliability ofpresence of a consistent representation from whicheither the more pretentious T~ representation wasreached or, alternatively, translation via less.-simple transfer was possible.
The model that emergedwas the following:TRF~AN~ I TRFF I GEN~AN R./ f  ............................... R~:zf GENAN~ I I GENFTRAThe motivation .\[or this design hinged on (i) thefact that the f-stratum could make use of know-howin computational linguistics, (2) the f-stratum wasa good starting point for innovative research onwhat T~.
stlould be for multilingoal TBMT, (3) themodel gave content to the notion of safety nets(rmbostness), (4) developmental issues,The claim made was that with a monolithic l .
,  theformulation of safety nets is hindered hy thehybridity prohlem~ their' input domain coold be anyunpredictable mombination of feasibly computable andadequate information on several dimensions in thegds.
\]he new design provided the f-stratum as a morereliable basis for' safe safety nets.2.2 .
Hul t id i~ns io~aI .This feature of the design did not change, Insteadof one multidimensional representation, we now hadtwo, No further attempt was mmde, however, tojust i fy  the use of multidimensional representations.Given the rejection of theoretical modularity on thebasis of considerations of reliability ofcomputation, the only course to take seemed to be toabandon the multidimensional view itself and to letthe strata themselves v, epresenh linguisticdimensions.
The new model became multistratal andmonodimensional,3.1.
khlltistratal.T,, was described as a sot of iodependently definedsubtheories for" representing normalised text (no),morphology (me), surface syntax (ss), deep syntax(dm) and semantics (sem), They were concogtumllyrelated to each other, however, by being based on acommon central notion of dependency defined in termsof slotfilling and modification, A strength of thismove is that linguistics in Eurotra could now profitfrom l inguist ic work in the outside world,The proposal suffered, l'lowever~ from the absence ofa clear view on what sorts of dedicated operationswere needed to actually map between arb i t ra r i l ydifferent dependency trees.
Nor were considerationsof the computational complexity of arbitrary tree-transformation formalisms taken into account in thedefinit ion of the levelo, A proposal to relate allthese levels to each other by giving them all alex ica l i s t  underpinning was rejected by the C,E.C.Finally, a stratificatienal strategy was imposed onthe makers of the design, with the (unjustified)intuition that it would provide a basis for theincorporation of safety nets into the model.295The model now roughly looked as follows (withquestion marks indicating undefined parts):TRF .

LtTRA3.2.
Monodimensional.Representations ref lect  only one l inguist icdimension: the gds approach was completelyabandoned.The theories identif ied described the representationof normalised text strings, the internal structureof words, the surface dependency, the canonicaldependency and the semantic dependency of the inputtexts.4.
The #resent desi~_LCde~T85jA\[!oB6\]?The properties of the current Eurotra designconstitute the topic of Arnold & des Tombe's paperin this volume.
Here, I merely relate i t  to previoushypotheses about the Eurotra translation model,The design is multistrata\] and monodimensional andcan be depicted as follows:ANGm/nt G~/mo ~/cm ~m/r~ G*X~emtext .
<-> nt.
<-> me.
<-> cs.
<-> re.
(-> sem.TRFtext,  <-> nt~ <-> mo~ <-> cst <-> rs~ <-) sem~t t t t tGt/nt S t /me Gt/c.
Gt/r~ G~/=~mGEN4.1.
Multistratal.Each stratum corresponds to an autonomous generatingdevice for a representation language, Each generatorconsists of a set of atoms and a set of constructorsthat together allow for the generation of L(8), aset of formally well-formed derivation trees.
Thela t ter  are then evaluated (by unif ication) to a setof meaningfull representations, R(G).The intuit ion underlying this model is thattranslation between atural language texts can bespl i t  up into a sequence of more IE~Y~_translations between elements of adjacentgenerators.
Adjacent generators must be devised sothat the primitive translations that obtain are a lsosimll_e, This is taken to mean that  primitivetranslations must be (i) compositional and (2) one-shot.
The jus t i f i cat ion  for compositionality is theintuit ion that the translation of some expression E296is a straightforward function of the translation ofE's parts and of the way these parts ere puttogether, The lat ter  is required to restrain thecomplexity of this function: the codomain of aprimitive translation must always be well-formed interms of the target generator, This forbids internalstrategy inside translators.The project is examining various hypotheses aboutparticular instantiations of this core model: e.g.translators could perform any one of the followingfour mappings: (i} derivation to derivation, ( i i )derivation to representation, ( i i i )  representationto derivation and (iv) representation torepresentation.
Possibi l i ty (i) was found to be toorest r ic t ive .
We now study possibi l i ty  ( i i i ) .
Notethe similarity between (iv) and the structuralcorrespondence approach adopted in LFG for mappingbetween information structures of a differentnature.4.2.
Monodi~ensional.The current strata envisaged are normalised text,morphology, configurational surface syntax,relational surface syntax and semantics.
Morphologyis based on work on word grammar as independent ofphrase structure grammar.
Configurational syntaxdraws from the X-theory l i terature.
Relationalsyntax representations resemble LFG f-structures.The semantic stratum, f ina l ly ,  is not yet fu l lyspecified: this has to do with the very specialrequirements that translation by means o~ simpletransfer puts on e semantic representation theory.The point is, however, that the non-semantic levelsare claimed to be feasible (cfr.
f-stratum in 2) andthat they can thus provide a basis for researching atranslation-oriented semantic theory,5.
Conclusion.I hope to have s l ight ly  l i f ted  the veil that hashidden the Eurotra project from the sc ient i f iccommunity for a number of years.
I t  has becomeclear, hopefully, that the Eurotra design has becomemore homogeneous and that i t  constitutes a valuablestep towards a better understanding of the problemof machine translation.REFERE~ICES.\[ArnoB3\]: Arnold, laspaert & des Tombs, LAEgujst~clArnoB4a\]: Arnold, Jaspaert & des Tombs, \[T_L~:3_FiEaiRe~prt, C,E,C,, 1984.\[ArnoB4b\]: Arnold, Oaspaert & des Tombs, \[T~I\[._.F.~.\[~~2\ [~,  C.E.C., 1984.\[ArnoBSa\]: Arnold, Jaspaert & des Tombs, ~!t~_@\[Arne86\]: Arnold & des lombe, Basic Theory and~ethodology in Eurotra, to appear in: 8.
