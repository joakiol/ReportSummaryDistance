Overview of the1994 ARPA Human Language Technology WorkshopClifford J. Weinstein, Chair, EditorMIT Lincoln LaboratoryLexington, MA 021731.
INTRODUCTIONThis volume presents papers, session summaries,and project summaries from the Second ARPAHuman Language Technology Workshop, whichwas held at the Merrill Lynch Conference Centerin Plainsboro, NJ, March 8-11, 1994.
TheWorkshop was actually the seventh in a series ofARPA workshops which began in 1988; the firstfive were called the DARPA Speech and NaturalLanguage Workshops, and the name was changedto the ARPA Human Language Technology(HLT) Workshop in 1993 to reflect he broadenedfocus and increasing unification of ARPA-sponsored research in spoken and writtenlanguage.
In addition, the "D" was dropped fromDARPA in 1993, reflecting a broadening of itscharter.
The Proceedings of the sevenWorkshops, all of which have been published byMorgan-Kaufmann, represent a rich source ofinformation on the rapid progress in spoken andwritten language technology which has beenachieved over the past decade, due in no smallmeasure to the leadership of the ARPA ProgramManagers.2.
THE 1994 ARPA HUMANLANGUAGE TECHNOLOGYWORKSHOPAs with past workshops, the 1994 HLTWorkshop provided a forum where researcherswere able to share information about very recenttechnical progress in a highly interactive setting.The scope included all areas of spoken andwritten language research under ARPA's HLTprogram, including speech recognition, speechunderstanding, text understanding, informationretrieval, and machine translation, with anemphasis on topics of particular current interestsuch as evaluation of language understandingsystems, and statistical and learning methods.The majority of the workshop participantsreceive funding under ARPA's HLT program.Other participants included: governmentresearchers and users of the technology;researchers not funded by ARPA who participatevoluntarily in these programs; and selectedvisitors from both inside and outside the UnitedStates.
Non-U.S. participation was particularlystrong in 1994, with 30 attendees representing 9countries; many of these non-U.S, attendeesparticipated irectly and voluntarily in the variousformal evaluations of human language systems.In all, there were 230 attendees at the 1994Workshop, consisting of approximately 150from ARPA sites, 30 U.S. governmentrepresentatives, 30 non-U.S, participants, and 20non-ARPA attendees from the U.S.For the first time, this HLT Workshop directlyfollowed an ARPA Spoken LanguageTechnology (SLT) Workshop which was held atthe same location on March 6-8.
This allowedthe detailed reporting and discussion of the latestevaluations of speech recognition and spokenlanguage systems to be held at the SLTWorkshop, allowing time for broader coverage oftechnical topics at the HLT Workshop.
It alsofacilitated the attendance atboth Workshops ofthe non-U.S, participants in these evaluations.The SLT Workshop was chaired by Richard Stemof Carnegie Mellon University and attractedapproximately 125 attendees.
A separate SLTWorkshop Proceedings is being published byMorgan Kaufmann.3.
HUMAN LANGUAGETECHNOLOGY PROGRAMOVERVIEWGeorge Doddington, ARPA Program Manager forHuman Language Technology, began theWorkshop with an overview of the program'smotivation, mission, theme areas,accomplishments, and future directions.Doddington emphasized the key role of HumanLanguage Technology in providing people withthe ability to effectively use the NationalInformation Infrastructure.
He stated a three-partHuman Language Technology Program Mission,to:develop Human Language Technologies ofkey importance;3, demonstrate Human Language Technologiesin compelling application contexts; and?
transfer Human Language Technologies intoproductive use.Doddington emphasized the dual roles ofILechnology R&D and technology transfer inserving this mission.
In the ARPA HLTProgram, R&D progress is driven byestablishing formal technical challenge tasks inthe theme areas including speech recognition,speech understanding, document retrieval,information extraction from text, and machinetranslation, and by providing infrastructuresupport including corpus development andregular, formal evaluations of the technology.Technology transfer is driven by identifyingcritical needs and technology transfer champions,and supporting the transfer with focussed R&D.Doddington summarized and highlighted recentprogress in; spoken language understanding inthe Air Travel Information System (ATIS) task;large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition;document detection; and machine translation.With regard to new technical directions, hehighlighted the current investigation of a task-independent evaluation of understanding, referredto as Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), whichconstituted a major topic of discussion later inthe Workshop.4.
HIGHLIGHTS OF THEWORKSHOP SESSIONSThe Workshop was comprised of 14 sessions,including a government panel session and ademonstration session.
For a good overview ofthe technical content of the workshop, the readeris encouraged to first read the Session Chairs'summaries which precede the collected papersfrom each of the sessions.
These summariesprovide perspective on the research reported aswell as outlining the key points in each set ofpapers.A few of the highlights of the Workshopincluded:The impressive progress reported by theLinguistic Data Consortium (three papers inSession 1) in collecting and disseminatinglexicons, text resources, and speech corporawhich are supporting the advancement ofHuman Language Technology worldwide.?
The new hub and spoke paradigm for large-vocabulary continuous peech recognition(CSR) evaluation, which has successfullybalanced common evaluation and diverseresearch goals.The Human Language Evaluation Session,which included many diverse views on theevaluation of language understanding and aspirited discussion of the SemanticEvaluation (SemEval) approaches currentlybeing explored in the ARPA HLTcommunity.A strong Machine Translation Session,including a report on a very substantialrecent evaluation which included 19participants; the fact that all but three ofthese participants were volunteers notsupported by ARPA is indicative of ARPA'sworld leadership role in this area.A Demonstration Session, organized andchaired by Victor Abrash, which includeddemonstrations of HLT for command andcontrol data access, spoken languagetranslation, access to data sources on theinformation highway, text retrieval andunderstanding, and reading education.A double-length session on Statistical andLearning Methods, highlighting thecontinuing progress in corpus-basedapproaches totext understanding.A Government Panel, organized and chairedby Oscar Garcia, which included both U.S.and international views on the directions ofHuman Language Technology.A New Directions Session, highlighted by apresentation by a Canadian astronaut andspeech researcher, Julie Payette, onapplications of speech recognition i  space,and also including two papers describingways in which speech recognitiontechnology has been applied to the automaticrecognition of handwritten text.5.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe success of this Workshop was due to thehard work of many people.
