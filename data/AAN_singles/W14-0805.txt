RICmarks@ilsp.athena-innovation.grAbstractWe report on the first, still on-going effort tointegrate verb MWEs in an LFG grammar ofModern Greek (MG).
Text is lemmatized andtagged with the ILSP FBT Tagger and is fedto a MWE filter that marksWords_With_Spaces in MWEs.
The output isthen formatted to feed an LFG/XLE grammarthat has been developed independently.
So farwe have identified and classified about 2500MWEs, and have processed 40% of them bymanipulating only the lexicon and not therules of the grammar.Research on MG MWEs (indicatively,Anastasiadi-Simeonidi, 1986; Fotopoulou, 1993;Mini et al., 2011) has developed collections ofMWEs and discussed classification, syntax andsemantics issues.
To the best of our knowledge,this is the first attempt to obtain deep parses of awide range of types of MG verb MWEs with richsyntactic structure.1 The parsing systemWe take advantage of the mature ILSP FBTTagger (Papageorgiou et al., 2000) that is anadaptation of the Brill tagger trained on MG text.It uses a PAROLE compatible tagset of 584 tags.The tagger works on the output of a sentencedetection and tokenisation tool and assigns alemma and a set of tags corresponding to anexhaustive morphological analysis of tokens(Fig.
1).
The tagger is a black box for our systemand allows for no preprocessing of MWEs, as itwould be possible if the XFST/XLE componentwas used (Attia, 2006).
We have been workingon a system that aims to move as much aspossible of the parsing burden from theLFG/XLE component to a MWE recognizer (the?filter?)
at the same time allowing for ?natural?LFG analyses.
Oflazer et al.
(2004) discuss asimilar preprocessing step but they focus on theretrieval and not on the deep parsing of verbMWEs.
Our filter, implemented in Perl, scans theoutput of the tagger for strings containing verbMWEs and feeds a script (?formatter?)
that yieldsa format readable by an LFG/XLE grammar.1.1 The filter lexiconThe filter consults the ?filter lexicon?
where eachverb MWE entry is specified for the following:1.
Compositionality.
Certain verb MWEs cantake a compositional interpretation.
For instance,the free subject, flexible (Sag et al, 2001) verbal33MWE ????
?????
?????
??
??
??
(9) has nocompositional interpretation while the semi-fixedMWE ???_??????
(2) ?to be beaten up?, can takethe compositional interpretation ?grab/stealthem-FEM?.
The filter lexicon specifies whichMWEs will be eventually assigned both MWEand compositional XLE parses.2.
The lemmatized form of Words_With_Spaces(WWS) whether they are independent fixedMWEs or substrings of a MWE.
For instance, thelemmatised WWS ??????_????
would be storedfor WWS ?????
?????
of the MWE (9).3.
PoS of the WWS.
For instance, we haveclassified the WWS ????-???-?????????
?penniless and calm?
(6) as adjective; however,only the second conjunct (?????????
?calm?)
isan adjective while the first conjunct ????
is anindeclinable non-Greek word that occurs withthis type of MWE only.
Regarding distribution,the conjunction behaves as an adjective.
Ingeneral, we have relied on distribution criteria inorder to assign PoS to WWSs.4.
Morphological constraints on the lemmatizedconstituents of a WWS that uniquely identifyfixed or semi-fixed MWE substrings.
Forinstance, for the adjective ?????
in the WWS?????
?????
(9) the lemma of the adjective??????
is stored together with the tags adjective-plural-accusative-neutral-basic.5.
Multiple WWSs if different word orders of thesame WWS occur, for instance ?????
[??
????
??????????
]WWS [gloss: drink the blood of people]and ?????
[???
???????
??
????
]WWS ?takes a lotof money from people by applying force?.1.2 The filterThe filter, implemented in Perl, reads the taggedsentence from an xml file (the output of thetagger), checks it for MWEs and feeds it to theformatter if no MWE or a MWE that can take acompositional interpretation is found.
Stringscontaining MWEs are preprocessed by the filter:their fixed parts are replaced with thecorresponding WWS and morphologicalconstraints and the resulting new string is sent tothe formatter.
The filter can identify all wordpermutations available to a listed MWE.2 An outline of the LFG analysisThe output of the formatter is parsed with anLFG grammar of MG.
The grammar includessublexical rules that parse the output of thetagger and ensure information flow from thetagger to XLE.
The sub-lexical trees can be seenin the c-structure of Fig.
1.
MG MWEs are richin syntactic structure despite any simplificationsthat might result from the usage of WWSs.
Inagreement with Gross (1998a; 1998b) and Miniet al.
(2011) who argue that MWEs andcompositional structures can be treated withmore or less the same grammar, we have so farmanipulated only the lexicon  but not thegrammar rules.
Identification of phrasalconstituents within the MWEs relies on possiblepermutations and the ability of XPs to intervenebetween two words, thus indicating the borderbetween two constituents.
Grammatical functionsare identified with diagnostics that apply tocompositional expressions such as morphologicalmarking and WH questions.
The types ofsyntactic structure we have treated thus far are:1.
Fixed verb WWS (Table 1:1): no inflection orword permutation.
(1)  ????
????
?take-2-sg-IMP    five-numeral?You are silly.?2.
Free subject-verb (Table 1:2): inflecting,SV/VS word order.
(2) O     ??????
???
?????
?the Peter-nom CL-pl-fem-acc grab-3-sg-past?Petros was beaten up.?3&4.
Impersonal verb-complement: inflecting,fixed object (Table 1:3) or saturated sententialsubject (Table 1:4), intervening XPs between theverb and its object or subject, VO/OV wordorder (but not VS/SV).
(3) ?????
?????????????
???
?.pour-3-sg-past chair-legs          yesterday?It rained cats and dogs yesterday.?
(4) ????

?????
?.have-3-sg-pres gusto-noun to rain?Don?t tell me that it might rain.

?The transitive verb ?????
?throw?
(8) is used asa control verb only in (8).
An alternative analysisthat would insure identity of subjects could treatthe exemplified MWE as a coordinationstructure.
We opted for the control approach anddefined a special entry of the verb ?????
?throw?because the particle ??
typically introduces35(probably controlled) subordinated clauses andthe constraints on verbal forms are those of ?
?-subordination and not of coordination.10.

?3 Conclusions and future researchThis is ongoing work but up to this point, naturalanalyses of the verb MWEs are possible with thestanding rule component of our LFG grammar ofMG.
On the other hand, the entries of the twolexica we have developed, namely the filter andthe XLE lexicon, provide a rich resource forstudying the features of the idiomaticity thatverb MWEs bring into ?normal?
MG(indicatively, see discussion of (8)).
In theimmediate future, we will use the samemethodology to parse the remaining types ofMWE in our collection and will draw on theaccumulated evidence to study the linguisticphenomena observed in verb MWEs againstmore general semasio-syntactic properties ofMG, for instance the role of controlconstructions and of animacy in this language.We will consider a more sophisticated design ofthe filter.
Last, we plan to investigate the issue ofsemantic representation of MWEs.Fig.
