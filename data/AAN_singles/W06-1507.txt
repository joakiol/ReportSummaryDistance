Analysesformulated in Tree Adjoining Grammarand Combinatorial Categorial Grammarare compared, with the conclusion that aperspicuous analysis of the the intricaciesof the data requires aspects of both for-malisms; in particular, the TAG notion ofthe extended domain of locality and theCCG notion of flexible constituency.1 Palestinian Arabic Negative ConcordIn Palestinian Arabic (PA), negative concord oc-curs with the determiner wEla ?
(not) even one,?where negative concord describes the failure of anexpression which expresses negation in some sen-tences to do so in others.
Phrases formed withwEla (?wEla-phrases?)
are interpreted either asnegative quantifiers (?NQ-wEla)?
or as polarity-sensitive indefinites (?NPI-wEla?).
wEla-phraseshave an NQ-interpretation preceding the finiteverb or verb complex in a clause (1-2) or in frag-ment answers (3-4):(1) wElanot.evenh?adaone.MSfi:-hUmin-thems??
:f-ni.saw.3ms-me?Not even ONE of them saw me!?
(2) wElanot.evenyo:mdayQag?abnipleased.3ms-mel-Ek?l.the-food?There wasn?t even one day the food pleased me!?
(3) Q: s?uwhatk?al-l-ak?said.3ms-to-youA: wElanot.evenis?i.thing?What did he say to you?
Nothing at all.?
(4) Q: mi:nwhos?Ufti?saw.2fsA: wElanot.evens?u:s?chick?bnsonyome:n.two-days?Who did you see?
Not even a two-day old chick!
?A preverbal wEla-phrase preceding a sententialnegation marker causes the sentence to have adouble-negation reading (5: compare with 2):(5) wElanot.evenyo:mdayma-Qag?abninot-pleased.3ms-mel-Ek?l.the-food?There wasn?t one day the food didn?t please me!?
?The food pleased me every day.
?NQ-wEla never occurs within the scope of nega-tion but does occur in post-verbal positions whichare not ?thematically entailed?
by the verb (6-7)1:(6) huwwahewElanot.evenis?i!thing?He is NOTHING!?
(7) hiyyashemag?ru:raconceited.fsQalauponwElanot.evenis?i.thing?She is conceited for absolutely NO reason!
?The NPI-interpretation is only available within thescope of antimorphic operators (Zwarts, 1993),like sentential negation or b?du:n ?without?
(8-9):(8) t?l?Qtileft.2fsb?du:n-mawithout-thattk?u:lisay.2fswElaevenis?i.thing?You left without saying even one thing!?
(9) la-s-sEnnato-the-yearma-baQt?i:-hUmnot-give.1s-themwEllaevenlUk?mibiteEkl.food?Up to a year I don?t give them even a bite of[solid] food.
?More than one wEla-phrase can have the NPI-interpretation at a time:(10) ma-k?Ultnot-said.1swElaevenis?ithingwElato-evenla-h?adaonefi:-hUm.in-them?I didn?t give anything at all to even one of them.
?It follows from the distributions of NQ- and NPI-wEla that wEla-phrases are blocked from post-verbal argument positions which are thematicallyentailed and which are not within the scope of anantimorphic operator.1Following (Herburger, 2001), ?thematically entailed?means that the meaning of the verb entails the existence ofan entity filling the thematic role in question.491.1 Negative Concord and LocalityPA negative concord is generally subject to strictlocality constraints: a wEla-phrase must be con-tained within the smallest inflected clause contain-ing its licensor.
It cannot be separated from its li-censor by the boundary of either an indicative (11)or a subjunctive/irrealis (12) complement:(11) * ma-waQattnot-promised.1s[ Eh?kitalkwElaevenmaQwithh?adaonefi:-hUmin-them].
(12) * batwak?k?aQ-?s?believe.1s-neg[ ?nnh?that.3fsb?th?
?bblikes.3fswElaevenh?adaone].Similar sentences with weaker polarity items suchas h?ada or Paiy h?ada ?anyone?
are acceptable:(13) ma-waQattnot-promised.1sEh?kitalkmaQwith( Paiyany) h?adaonefi:-hUm.in-them?I didn?t promise to talk with any of them.?
(14) batwak?k?aQ-?s?believe.1s-neg?nnh?that.3fsb?th?
?bblikes.3fs( Paiyany) h?ada.one?I don?t think that she likes ANY one.
?This suggests that negative concord is a strictlybounded dependency like agreement marking, ar-gument realization, or reflexive binding.However, there are exceptions to this general-ization.
?Long-distance?
negative concord is pos-sible between a matrix negation morpheme andwEla-phrases inside the complements of a smallclass of verbs, including b?dd- ?want?
(15), Xalla?to allow?
(16), h?a:wal ?to try?
(17, 25 below) orQ?r?f ?to know how to, to be able to?
(18 below):(15) ma-b?ddnanot-want.1snXallileave.1pwElaevenzElami.fellow?We don?t want to leave even one man.?
(16) ma-Xallu:-ni:-s?not-allowed.3mp-me-neg?
:kOleat.1swElaevenlUk?mibite?They wouldn?t let me eat even one bite!
?The embedding can be recursive, provided thatonly verbs in this class are used (17).
(17) b?ddi:-s?want.1s-negah?a:w?ltry.1sEh?kispeak.1swElaevenmaQwithh?ada.one?I don?t want try to talk with anyone at all.
?These verbs correspond to verbs found in manyother languages which trigger a process often re-ferred to as restructuring or clause union.
I fol-low (Aissen and Perlmutter, 1983) in calling themtrigger verbs.
Restructuring involves the ?stretch-ing?
of the domain of locality for certain kinds ofbounded dependencies from the complement of atrigger verb to include the clause that it heads.At present no other phenomena have been iden-tified in PA which independently confirm that ithas restructuring.
However, long-distance nega-tive concord is identified as a restructuring phe-nomenon in several languages such as West Flem-ish (Haegeman and Zanuttini, 1996), Polish (Dzi-wirek, 1998), and Serbian (Progovac, 2000).
Assuch, I assume for now that long-distance negativeconcord in PA is a form of restructuring as well.2 A TAG AnalysisRestructuring involves a seeming paradox involv-ing a dependency which is non-local in the hier-archical structure of a sentence but local in its se-mantics.
Tree Adjoining Grammars are well suitedfor analyzing restructuring because the distinctionbetween a derived tree and the derivation tree asso-ciated with it provides two notions of locality.
Re-structuring phenomena which have been analyzedwith TAGs include clitic-climbing in Spanish andItalian (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000), long-distancescrambling in German (Rambow, 1994), and long-distance agreement in Tsez (Frank, 2006).
It there-fore is natural to explore a TAG analysis for long-distance negative concord in PA.To illustrate with a simple example, the nega-tive concord dependency in (18) is licensed withinan initial tree headed by Ekt?b ?write,?
and isthen ?stretched?
by adjunction of the auxiliary treeheaded by Q?r?ft ?I was able to?
(19):(18) ma-Q?r?ftnot-knew.1sEkt?bwrite.1swElaevenk?lmi.word?I wasn?t able to write even one word.?
(19) ?:IP00?
:IPma:- IP*?:IP00?
:IPQ?r?ft IP*?
:IP00Ekt?b NP?02?
:NPwEla k?lmiThe locality constraint on negative concord canthen be expressed as a generalization about thederivation tree (20): a wEla-phrase and its licen-sor must be sisters:(20) ??
(02) ?
(00) ?
(00)However, several properties of negative concordin PA preclude a simple analysis like this.502.1 Clause-local DependenciesThe first property is the domain of locality of thenegative concord dependency.
In a simple TAG,syntactic dependencies are licensed within an ele-mentary tree: they are tree-local.
However, nega-tive concord in PA is clause-local, because wEla-phrases are not licensed within the immediate treeto which they are attached, but instead within theimmediate clausal tree containing them.
For ex-ample, wEla-phrases can be inside prepositionalphrases attached to a negative clause (21-22):(21) ma-kaQattnot-sat.1s[PP g?an?bnext.towElaevenh?adaonefi:-hUmin-them]?I didn?t sit next to even one of them.?
(22) b?tXall?fu:-s?disagree.2mp-negQan-nafrom-us[PP bi-wElawith-evenis?ithing].
?You don?t disagree with us about even one thing.
?In a simple TAG analysis, the wEla-phrase firstsubstitutes into the initial tree headed by thepreposition, which is then attached to the clausaltree.
The relationship between the wEla-phraseand its licensor would therefore not be tree-local.Clause-locality can be modeled with what Irefer to as ?Scope TAG?
(Kallmeyer and Joshi,2003), a multi-component TAG (MC-TAG) inwhich quantificational NPs are tree sets containingtwo parts: a ?defective?
auxiliary tree IP* whichspecifies the scope of the quantifier, and an NP-tree which specifies its restriction.
I refer to suchtree sets as ?scope sets.
?While Kallmeyer & Joshi?s proposal is intendedto capture the semantic scope of quantifiers, it canalso be used to express clause locality by assigningPPs to scope sets as well, and by stipulating thatscope sets can combine with each other by meansof set-local adjunction.
The IP*-node in the scope-set of a wEla-phrase can then adjoin to the IP*-node in the PP scope set, which in turn adjoins tothe IP-node of the initial tree.For example, (21) above can be analyzed withthe elementary trees in (23) (trees are in abbrevi-ated form), producing the derivation tree in (24):(23) a. ?
:{?1 : IP* , ?2 : NPwEla h?ada}b. ?

?n?b NP?02}c.
?
: IPma:- IP*?
: IP00IkaQattPP?02(24) ??1(00)?1(00)?
(00) ?2(02)?2(02)However, given (24) it is still not possible to statea generalization about negative concord locality interms of sisterhood in the derivation tree.This can be remedied by adopting the ?node-sharing?
relation proposed by (Kallmeyer, 2005).Informally, two nodes ?
and ?
are in a node-sharing relation in a derivation tree T iff theyare either in a mother-daughter relation in T ata node address A, or there is a sequence S ofnodes N1 .
.
.
Nn which is the transitive closure ofa mother-daughter relation in T in which the nodepairs are related in terms of the root node or footnode in an auxiliary tree.On this basis, the negative concord locality gen-eralization is that a wEla-phrase and its licensorare ?shared-node sisters?
in the derivation tree,where shared-node sisters are two nodes A and Bwhich are each in a shared-node relation with asingle node C .
For example, in (24) ?
is a shared-node parent of both ?1 and ?.
Accordingly, ?1and ?
are shared-node sisters with respect to ?.2.2 Trigger Verbs and Complement TypeThe second property of PA long-distance negativeconcord that complicates a TAG analysis has todo with the kinds of complement that they take.TAG approaches to restructuring exploit ?reducedcomplement?
analyses in which trigger verbs take?smaller?
complements than other kinds of sub-ordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000).However, PA trigger verbs are mixed in terms ofthe types of complements they take: h?a:wal ?tryto?
or k?
?d?r ?be able to?
optionally allow a com-plementizer P?nn- (25-26), while b?dd- ?want?
orQ?r?f ?know to, be able to?
exclude it (27-28):(25) ma-h?a:waltnot-tried.1s( ?nnithat.1s) Eh?kispeak.1swElaevenmaQwithh?ada.one?I didn?t try to talk with even one of them.?
(26) ma-k?
?d?rtnot-could.1s( ?nnithat.1s) Eh?kispeak.1swElaevenmaQwithh?ada.one?I wasn?t able to speak with even one of them.?
(27) ma-b?dd-i:-?s?not-want.1s-neg( *?nnithat.1s) as?u:fsee.1swElaevenh?ada.one?I don?t want to see even ONE of them.?
(28) ma-Q?r?ftnot-knww.1s( *?nnithat.1s) Ekt?bwrite.1swElaevenk?lmi.word?I wan?t able to write even one word.
?51Assuming that the presence of a complementizerindicates a CP category, and that the presence ofagreement marking on the verb indicates an IP cat-egory, what these data show is that some triggerverbs allow either CP or IP complements, whileothers allow only IP complements.
It follows thatcomplement category cannot be exploited as a wayto distinguish trigger verbs from non-trigger verbs.This is an essential distinction because restruc-turing is not the only phenomenon which in-volves adjunction.
For example, long-distance A-dependencies are analyzed in TAG as involvingadjunction of auxiliary trees.
(29-30) show thatthe same verbs which block long-distance nega-tive concord allow long-distance A-dependencies,indicating that they must also be analyzed as auxil-iary trees.
Moreover, (30) can include the comple-mentizer P?nn-, indicating that it takes the samekinds of complements as do trigger verbs likek?
?d?r ?be able?
and h?a:wal ?try?
:(29) mi:nwhob?t?twak?k?aQbelieve.2msyah?salget.3msQalauponk?:scup?l-Q?

(30) s?uwhatwaQattpromised.2ms( ?nnakthat.2ms) taQt?i:-h?
?give.2ms-her?What did you promise to give her?
?A failure to distinguish between trigger verbs andnon-trigger verbs will over-predict the availabilityof long-distance negative concord.To make this distinction, I use Dowty?s (Dowty,1994) analysis of negative concord licensing.Dowty models negative concord with a ?polarity?feature which takes ?+?
or ?-?
values.
When a neg-ative concord item combines with a clausal cate-gory it specifies (by unification) the clause as hav-ing a negative value for this feature.
In addition,Dowty assumes that root clauses must have a pos-itive value for the feature: I refer to this as the rootclause polarity constraint.
Negation morphemes(as well as b?du:n ?without?)
take a complementspecified as POL- and return a constituent with aPOL+ feature.
A root clause containing a negativeconcord item and lacking a negation morphemewill have a POL- feature for its root node and vio-late the root clause polarity constraint.
This de-rives the requirement that wEla phrases in rootclauses be ?roofed?
by a negation morpheme.Turning to long-distance negative concord, trig-ger verbs can be distinguished from non-triggerverbs by stipulating that non-trigger verbs takePOL+ complements, while trigger verbs (and aux-iliary verbs) impose no polarity specification andinstead inherit the polarity feature with which theircomplement is specified2.
An analysis of this kindapplied to (18) would result in a derived tree (32)which satisfies the root clause polarity constraint.

-?
appears to be a second-positionattaching to the first word-sized constituent in thestring produced by an IP-constituent, provided thatthe word contains a morpheme expressing personfeatures (Awwad, 1987; Eid, 1993).The most frequent distribution has -?
attachedto the leftmost verb stem in a clause, which maybe the main verb in a mono-verbal predicate (33),or to the leftmost auxiliary in a clause with com-pound tense-aspect-mood marking (34-35):(33) ma-n?mt-?s?not-slept.1s-negfi-l-le:l.in-the-night?I didn?t sleep last night.?

?2This is similar to Frank?s (Frank, 2006) proposal for an-alyzing long-distance agreement in Tsez.52In other kinds of sentences, -?
attaches to a varietyof non-verbal expressions, including the indefinitepronoun h?ada ?(any)one?
(36), the existential par-ticle fi: (37), inflected prepositions (38), and theadverb QUmr ?ever?
(39):(36) ma-h?ada:-s?not-one.ms-negk?:nwas.3msy?Qg?

?What these expressions all have in common withverb stems is that they occur as the first constituentin the clause and that they all contain a morphemeexpressing person features.
It follows that -?
isconstrained to occur in the second position at-tached to a word that is inflected for person.The cases in which -?
attaches to a verb can bemodeled by assuming that ma:- and -?
are part ofa tree set and that -?
adjoins to right of an I-node:(40){?1 : IPma:- IP*, ?2 : II -?
}(41) IPIPma:- IP*IPI PPfi-l-le:lII* -?In?mtThe cases with -?
attached to a non-verbal expres-sion require a second analysis.
One possibility isto assume a second tree for -?
like the first, exceptwith -?
preceding the foot node.
This requires stip-ulating a morphological output filter that affixes -?to the preceding word and blocks use of ?2 in (40):(42){?1 : IPma:- IP*, ?2 : I-?

:nThis is still not adaquate for (35), in which -?
isattached to a ?serial auxiliary?
(Hussein, 1990),one of a small set of verb stems which functionas aspectual adverbs and which ?agree?
with themain verb in aspectual form and agreement mark-ing.
Serial auxiliaries are plausibly analyzed asadverbial IP-auxiliary trees as in (44):(44) IPIQadIP*IPIPIk?al-l-iCP?The structure resulting from (44) has two I-nodes,and another constraint would have to be stipulatedforcing -?
to adjoin to the leftmost of the two.To sum up, a TAG analysis can be formulatedfor PA long-distance negative concord which al-lows the locality of negative concord licensing tobe stated as a generalization about shared-nodederivation trees.
However, the analysis requiresbrute force stipulations to capture the morpholog-ical expression of negation in PA negative sen-tences.
Moreover, the TAG analysis does not pro-vide a way to express the simple morphologicalgeneralization that -?
falls in the second positionin the string generated by the clause.3 A CCG AnalysisThe TAG analysis has difficulty accommodatingthe distribution of -?
because TAG trees are phrasestructures, making it difficult to state constraintson strings of words rather than on hierarchicalstructure.
Categorial Grammar, on the other hand,is a string calculus, and its operations result instring concatenation rather than structure expan-sion.
For this reason, a CG can be constrained tonot generate particular kinds of strings, rather than53particular trees.
A CG therefore provides a way tostate constraints on the distribution of -?
more di-rectly than a phrase-structure grammar does.I assume a Combinatory Categorial Gram-mar (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000b;Baldridge, 2002).
The basis of the CCG analysisis that npI-wEla-phrases are treated as type-raisedcategories which look for an s category to theirleft.
I continue following Dowty in assuming theroot clause polarity principle and in assumingthat wEla-phrases specify a POL- feature onthe s-headed category that they combine with.NQ-wEla phrases, on the other hand, are treated asnegative quantifiers which look for their s-headedargument to the right:(45) NQ-wEla :- (Spol+$/(Spol+\$/NP))/NP :?P?Q.
?x[P (x) & Q(x)](46) NPI-wEla :- (Spol?$\(Spol?$/NP))/NP :?P?Q.?
?x[P (x) & Q(x)]The negation morphemes are treated as follows (-?is semantically vacuous):(47) ma:- :- Spol+$/Spol?$ : ?P st .
?P (e)(48) -?
:- Spol?$\?Spol?$Verbs have the following types3:(49) ?Uft :- S\NP/NP : ?y.?x.
[x saw y](50) h?a:walt :- S\NP/(s\NP) : ?x.
?P st .
[x tries P (x)]The -?
morpheme fixes a clause with a POL-feature, while ma:- takes the POL- clausal cate-gory and changes its value for the polarity featureto POL+, satisfying the root clause polarity con-straint.
This works much as the TAG analysis did.The slash in the type for -?
is marked with the?crossed composition?
modality.
This allows -?
tocombine with a preceding s-headed category whilereturning a category looking for its arguments tothe right (Figures 1-2)4.Turning to long-distance negative concord, aCCG analysis, like the TAG analysis above, hasto account for the distinction between triggerverbs and non-trigger verbs.
The CCG analog ofauxiliary-tree adjunction is function composition.The long-distance negative concord dependencytherefore involves a specific kind of compositionsubject to stricter constraints than is the more gen-eral kind which produces A-dependencies.In order to model this, I adapt Hepple?s (Hep-ple, 1990) approach to modeling island constraints3The type assignments ignore the representation of VSword order and pro-drop sentences.4Logical forms are surpressed in the derivations.in Categorial Type Logic.
In brief, Hepple?s ap-proach is to assign unary modalities to the argu-ments of clausal categories (such as subordinat-ing verbs or relative pronouns) as well as to thenominal argument of a type-raised extracted cate-gory (such as a question word or topicalized nounphrase).
The former are referred to as ?boundingmodalities,?
and the latter as ?penetrative modal-ities.?
Interaction axioms require the penetrativemodality of an extraction category to be compati-ble with the bounding category of its argument interms of a type hierarchy defined over modalities.The unary modalities in CTL can be duplicatedin CCG as features on category labels, so to ap-proximate Hepple?s proposal, I define a feature hi-erarchy as follows:(51) hg cEach pair of sisters in the hierarchy consists of a?penetrative feature?
and the ?bounding feature?which blocks it (following Hepple?s terminology).The feature c is an penetrative feature which isblocked by the g feature, and h is the most gen-eral or permissive bounding feature.The idea is that categories which participate inrestructuring dependencies are marked with the cpenetrative feature, which is spread across all thearguments of a complex type:(52) wEla h?ada :- Sc$\(Sc$/NPc)Trigger verbs impose the h bounding feature ontheir complements, while non-trigger embeddingverbs impose the g feature:(53) b?dd- ?want,?
Q?r?f ?be able to,?
h?a:wal ?try to?
:-S\NP/(Sh\NPh)(54) waQad-yu:Q?d ?promise to?
:- S\NP/(Sg\NPg)According to (51), categories marked with fea-ture h are compatible with categories marked withfeature c, while categories marked with feature gclash with it.
The clash between g and c expressesthe restriction on restructuring dependencies.For example, in an analysis of (18), wEla k?lmiapplies to the composed constituent, Q?r?ft Ekt?b.This is possible because the penetrative featurec on the wEla-phrase is compatible with the hbounding feature which Q?r?ft passes to its com-plement (Figure 3).Long-distance negative concord is blocked intwo ways.
A wide-scope derivation (in which thewEla-phrase combines with the composition of the54matrix and embedded verbs) is blocked by a fea-ture clash between the g and c features (Figure4).
A narrow scope derivation (in which the wEla-phrase combines with the embedded verb only)is blocked because of a resulting clash in polar-ity features between the embedded clause and thematrix verb (Figure 5).4 Comparison and DiscussionWhile the TAG analysis imposes certain limita-tions on the ordering of morphemes, it does pro-vide a very simple and intuitive way to describerestructuring verbs as a natural class that includesauxiliary verbs, the other kinds of verb stemswhich are ?transparent?
to negative concord.
Incontrast, The CCG analysis has a technical flavor,and it is not clear to what extent it reflects a lin-guistic intuition.
The CCG analysis does, how-ever, capture the distribution of the negation mor-phemes in PA.
It would therefore be interestingto explore further whether the Hepple-style fea-ture/modality approach could be associated withsome linguistic phenomenon.One interesting possibility would be to useSteedman?s theory of intonation (Steedman,2000a) to explore the prosodic properties of re-structuring sentences in Arabic (and in other lan-guages) to see whether the availability of restruc-turing correlates with certain prosodic properties.There has been very little study of sentential into-nation in Arabic, and so very little empirical ba-sis for an investigation.
However, should such aninvestigation bear fruit, it might suggest that Hep-ple?s approach to extraction constraints could berecast as a theory of intonation.
This would allowpowerful generalizations to be stated relating theprosodic properties of sentences in PA and otherlanguages to their syntactic properties.ReferencesJudith Aissen and David Perlmutter.
