Proceedings of the First Workshop on Applying NLP Tools to Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 85?94,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Compilation of a Swiss German Dialect Corpusand its Application to PoS TaggingNora HollensteinUniversity of Zurichhollenstein@cl.uzh.chNo?emi AepliUniversity of Zurichnoemi.aepli@uzh.chAbstractSwiss German is a dialect continuum whose dialects are very different from Standard German,the official language of the German part of Switzerland.
However, dealing with Swiss German innatural language processing, usually the detour through Standard German is taken.
As writing inSwiss German has become more and more popular in recent years, we would like to provide datato serve as a stepping stone to automatically process the dialects.
We compiled NOAH?s Corpusof Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-of-Speech tags.
Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speechtagger and achieved an accuracy of 90.62%.1 IntroductionSwiss German is not an official language of Switzerland, rather it includes dialects of Standard German,which is one of the four official languages.
However, it is different from Standard German in terms ofphonetics, lexicon, morphology and syntax.
Swiss German is not dividable into a few dialects, in fact it isa dialect continuum with a huge variety.
Swiss German is not only a spoken dialect but increasingly usedin written form, especially in less formal text types.
Often, Swiss German speakers write text messages,emails and blogs in Swiss German.
However, in recent years it has become more and more popular andauthors are publishing in their own dialect.
Nonetheless, there is neither a writing standard nor an officialorthography, which increases the variations dramatically due to the fact that people write as they pleasewith their own style.So far, there are almost no natural language processing (NLP) tools for Swiss German (Scherrer andOwen, 2010).
Considering the fact that the major part of communication between Swiss people of theGerman part is in dialect, we would like to start building NLP tools for Swiss German dialects.Furthermore, it is an attempt to deal with dialect varieties directly instead of taking the detour throughthe standard of a language.
Speakers of various dialects increasingly communicate through social mediain their own varieties.
These interactions are relatively easily accessible and could be used as a sourceof data.
However, there is a lack of natural language processing tools for dialects, which need to bedeveloped first in order to process these data automatically.We start with training a model for a Swiss German Part-of-Speech tagger, which is one of the first stepsdealing with the automatic processing of natural language.
Based on a part-of-speech tagged corpus, fur-ther processes like semantical analysis, syntactical parsing or even applications like machine translationcan be conducted.In order to train a PoS tagger we need a corpus annotated with parts-of-speech.
As such data does notexist yet, we compiled NOAH?s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects containing Swiss German texts of dif-ferent genres, and annotated it manually.
This is an iterative process alternating between running/traininga PoS tagger and manually annotating/correcting the output.
The corpus we present in this paper consistsof 73,616 manually annotated tokens covering many dialect variations of the German-speaking part ofSwitzerland.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In section 4 we introduce ourcorpus including the adapted tagset before we present the application of our corpus to the Part-of-Speechtagging task in section 5.2 Related WorkMost natural language processing applications focus on standardised, written language varieties, butfrom a methodological as well as a practical point of view, it is interesting to develop NLP methods forvariational linguistics.
Even though there are no other resources of this size and no studies on PoS taggingfor written Swiss German, there have been a few approaches which share some common aspects with ourwork.
While there are some corpora of spoken texts, such as the Archimob project (Dejung et al., 1999)which comprises transcribed interviews, it is difficult to find resources to build a written Swiss Germancorpus.
One of the rare written resources is the sms4science project (D?urscheid and Stark, 2011), acollection of text messages in all official languages of Switzerland as well as Swiss German dialects.Concerning Part-of-Speech tagging for non-standard dialects, there are some approaches addressinglinguistic varieties in historical texts, Hinrichs and Zastrow (2012) and Rayson et al.
(2007) for Germanand English respectively.
Furthermore, Diab (2009), Habash and Rambow (2009) and Duh and Kirchhoff(2005) worked on PoS tagging for Arabic dialects.
The latter developed a minimally supervised PoStagger for an Egyptian Arabic dialect, which does not have a standard orthography either, without usingany dialect-specific tools.As far as Swiss German NLP goes, there are approaches to dialect identification (Scherrer and Owen,2010), dialect machine translation (Scherrer, 2012) and morphology generation (Scherrer, 2013).3 Swiss GermanSwiss German belongs to the Alemannic group of dialects, a branch of the Germanic language family.This group can be split into three linguistic divisions; Low, High and Highest Alemannic, each of whichcontains a few regions of Switzerland.
There is no strict border between the Swiss German dialects andthe other Alemannic dialects, rather it is referred to as a dialect continuum.
Unlike the continuum amongSwiss German dialects, there is a strict separation between Swiss German and Standard German.
Whenit comes to the dialects of Swiss German, one can find the concept of diglossia.
Diglossia is definedas a situation in which two languages (or two varieties of the same language) are used under differentconditions within a language community.
In the case of the German language, Standard German is usedin Switzerland nearly exclusively in written context while Swiss German is in daily use, mostly in spokenform but also in informal written contexts (Siebenhaar and Wyler, 1997).
However, this distinction isbecoming more and more blurred.
Schools are one of a few environments where Standard Germanis expected to be used in spoken language.
Unlike the situation in other languages, it is standard inSwitzerland to use dialect even in formal situations.
In Swiss media, both TV and radio, Swiss Germanis well represented and commonly used.With the introduction of emails, text messages, blogs and chats, Swiss German is taking over moreand more space in written contexts.
Nowadays, especially for the younger generations, it is completelynormal to write in Swiss German.
However, it is not limited to the private communication.
In fact, itis even becoming a cult status to write and publish in Swiss German.
Many authors, among them forexample Lenz (2013), Schobinger (2014) and Kaiser (2012) write books in their dialect, and newspaperagencies publish newspapers in Swiss German, e.g.
Blick am Abend (Ringier AG, 2013, 2014).
Even theSwiss company Swatch has published their annual report 2012 in addition to Standard German, Frenchand English also Swiss German (The Swatch Group AG, 2012).
This hype does not seem to cease, inthe contrary.
Speaking a certain dialect is part of the identification.
Swiss are proud of their dialect,which makes it possible to identify their home region if they move to another canton.
Despite the bigdifferences, speakers of various dialects usually understand each other, except a few German varieties ofthe canton Valais which others usually have troubles understanding (Keller, 1961).863.1 Differences to Standard GermanSwiss German differs from Standard German in many aspects such as phonetics, lexicon, morphologyand syntax.
One of the most significant differences is the vocabulary, which even introduces a new wordclass not in use in Standard German (see section 4.2).
In Swiss German, the Standard German wordsare sometimes used in a different manner.
For instance, in some cases the genus may change: the wordRadio (radio) as a masculine word (in Swiss German) instead of neutral (in Standard German).
However,there are not merely differences between Swiss and Standard German, but also between the differentdialectal regions.
Scherrer (2011) differs between variations which apply for the whole Swiss Germanspeaking area and differences which appear only in certain dialects and not outside of Allemanic dialects.The differences between the dialects are partly due to the influence from other languages.
For instancedialects closer to the French speaking part of Switzerland use different grammatical constructions thanEastern Swiss dialects.
In this section we describe some examples of disparities between the SwissGerman dialects and Standard German.In Swiss German there is no preterite tense (?Pr?ateritum?)
and the pluperfect (?Plusquamperfekt?
)is used extremely rarely.
Both of them are expressed using the present perfect (?Perfekt?)
or rather aduplication of it (for an example see table 1).
Another difference exists with regards to verb tensesand the use of the auxiliary verbs sein (to be) and haben (to have).
For instance, if you are cold, inSwitzerland you would say Ich ha chalt., where ha is the first person singular of ?to have?.
However, toexpress yourself in this situation in Standard German, the auxilary verb ?to be?
is used: Mir ist kalt.Furthermore, there is more freedom in the order of words of a sentence, especially concerning verbs(for an example see table 1) as well as more possibilities to correctly arrange phrases.
The overt specifi-cation of the subject is another difference.
In Swiss German the subject can be dropped in many cases,the information about the person is then usually given in the conjugation of the verb.
In the questionChunnsch au?
(Swiss German) vs. Kommst du auch?
(Standard German) (Are you coming too?
), thesubject du is not explicitly expressed in the Swiss German version but only in the second person singularconjugation of the verb.Regarding nouns, the four cases of Standard German (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) arenot all in use in the dialects (Siebenhaar and Voegeli, 1997).
Swiss German speakers generally neitherspeak nor write in the genitive case, apart from a few exceptions e.g.
in the dialect of the canton Valais.The genitive is replaced by a possessive dative or a phrase using prepositions.
This means, in order toexpress the German phrase die Ohren des Hasen (the bunny?s ears), either the possessive dative am Haassini Ohr?a or a preposition d Ohr?a vom Haas (where vom is a fusion of an preposition von and an articledem) is used.
Moreover, nominative and accusative forms only differ in personal pronouns, whereas thedative case, if used, is marked with its own determiner and endings for adjectives and nouns.There are many phenomena, which are treated differently not only in regards to Standard Germanbut also in different dialects.
First of all, the lexicon varies a lot.
The variations do not only includedifferent pronunciation but also completely different words.
For instance in some regions of Switzerland,the Standard German word Butter (butter) is used (even though with a masculine article instead of thefeminine one, which is correct in Standard German).
In other regions, however, different words such asAnke are used instead.
Another variation concerns the order of verbs if there is more than one of them ina sentence.
It is often inverted compared to Standard German, but this varies according to the dialect.
Toexpress a final clause with um .
.
.
zu (in order to) for instance, people in eastern Switzerland would usethe concatenation zum.
Closer to the French speaking part though, the construction f?ur .
.
.
z is commonlyused, which marks the similarity to the French pour .
.
.
.The following sentences in table 1 contain examples of both kinds of differences.
On the one hand,there are the Standard German preterite forms liess and hatte, which are expressed in the perfect tenseacross dialects: hat .
.
.
(gehen) lassen and hat gehabt.
On the other hand, the order of the verbs in theperfect construction (het gha vs. gha h?at) as well as the final clause with um .
.
.
zu differs from dialect todialect.Considering the way people write in Swiss German reveals another characteristic.
The aforementionedlack of a spelling standard causes variations not only between different authors but also within texts of87Dialect around Bern Si het ne la ga, w?u er ne gnue G?aud het gha, f ?ur es Billet z?l?ose.Dialect around Zurich Si h?at ihn gah lah, wil er n?od gnueg G?ald gha h?at, zum es Billet l?ose.Standard German Sie liess ihn gehen, weil er nicht genug Geld hatte, um ein Billet zu kaufen.English She let him go because he did not have enough money to buy a ticket.Table 1: Differences between dialects and Standard Germanthe same author.
As people write how they speak, they are not consistent and may spell the same worddifferently in the same sentence.
They are also free to merge any words, which is quite common.
Joiningwords into compounds is not an unseen phenomena in Standard German either.
However, a compoundis a word consisting of more than one stem, which can act as one word with one corresponding part-of-speech (usually the one of the last part), e.g.
Skilift (ski lift).
In Swiss German, the process of mergingwords rather resembles the phenomena of clitics, i.e.
phonologically bound to another word (Loos et al.,2004).
For example g?ommer is Swiss German for gehen wir (we go).
G?ommer can not be split intoverb and pronoun, as the separate occurrences would be g?ond (first person plural of to go) and mir (we).Thus, such merged words are grammatically different words which, however, are phonologically boundand can not stand alone.
One phonological word (realised as one alphabetic string limited by whitespaces) can even contain the subject, an object and the finite verb of the sentence (see section 4.2 for anexample).
This means it can not be assigned to one part-of-speech.
In section 4.2 we present how wedeal with them in the part-of-speech tagging task.To strengthen our argumentation for the necessity of a Swiss German PoS tagger we compare ourresults of the training with our corpus with the performance of a Standard German tagger.
We run theGerman model of the most common tagger for Standard German, the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), on ourSwiss German test set.
The tagger reaches an accuracy of 50.8%, which is significantly lower than theresult after the training with our corpus.As we have shown in this section, the dialects of Swiss German differ in many aspects from StandardGerman.
It is not only a different pronounciation or spelling with some variations in the vocabulary.It also involves syntactic differences and constructions which are ungrammatical when transferred toGerman.
Therefore we argue against a normalisation of Swiss German as a mapping to Standard German,a frequently proposed approach dealing with varieties.4 Corpus CreationWe compiled a Swiss German dialect corpus in order to provide resources to work with Swiss German.Furthermore, we applied the corpus to the basic natural language processing task of Part-of-Speechtagging as a first application.
Therefore, we specified a tagset for Swiss German and annotated thecorpus according to this tagset.4.1 NOAH?s Corpus of Swiss German DialectsWe present NOAH?s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects, a unique resource for Swiss German.
We com-piled a Swiss German corpus containing manually annotated part-of-speech tags of 73,616 tokens.
Asthe first annotated resource for written texts in Swiss German dialects, the goal is to cover various textgenres as well as different dialects from all regions of Switzerland.
NOAH?s Corpus is freely availablefor research.1In NOAH?s Corpus, we include articles from the Alemannic Wikipedia (Wikipedia, The Free Encyclo-pedia, 2011) in five major dialects (Aarau, Basel, Bern, Zurich and the Eastern part of Switzerland) and aSwiss German special edition of the newspaper ?Blick am Abend?
(Ringier AG, 2013), which was pub-lished in 2013.
In addition, we added sections of the Swiss German dialect version of the official annualreport of the Swatch company from 2012 (The Swatch Group AG, 2012).
Furthermore, we incorporatedextracts of novels from the Swiss author Viktor Schobinger (Viktor Schobinger, 2013) which are writtenexclusively in the Zurich dialect.
Finally, we also included three blogs from BlogSpot in various dialectsas a web resource.
The detailed token quantities for each text source are shown in table 2.1http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research/downloads.html88Text source No.

Thus,since the consistency of annotations in natural language corpora is of great importance for PoS taggingperformance, we put great emphasis on the manual annotations.
After the annotation of the corpus bynative speakers, various consistency checks were conducted.
For instance, we checked words with lowprobabilities in the tagging model and we also conducted random checks for cases of difficult tags.4.2 TagsetAs the basic tagset we use the Stuttgart-T?ubingen-TagSet (STTS), which is the standard for German(Schiller et al., 1999).
Because of the differences between German and the Swiss German dialects weadditionally introduced the tag PTKINF as well as the adding of a ?+?-sign to any PoS tag.The newly introduced tag PTKINF represents an infinitive particle suggested by Glaser (2003).
Itis a commonly used and therefore widely analysed phenomenon for Swiss German dialects with nocorresponding word or construction in German.
In Swiss German people say Ich go go poschte.
(I?mgoing shopping.).
The second go corresponds to the finite verb gehen (to go) in the according StandardGerman sentence Ich gehe einkaufen.
The first go, however, does not exist in the Standard Germanversion.
This particle is probably originally derived from gehen.
However, as a particle it exceeds theuse in gehen (Glaser, 2003).
This infinitive particle go (derived from gehen; to go) also comes in otherforms like for instance cho (derived from kommen; to come) and afa (probably derived from anfangen;to begin).
In our corpus we found 37 occurrences of this tag.Furthermore, we introduce special tags for merged words.
Since Swiss German does not have officialspelling rules, words can be freely joined.
Splitting these words in a pre-processing step would be oneapproach to deal with them.
However, it is not always clear where to split them and would result instrange words as the words phonologically assimilate when merged with others (see section 3.1).
AlsoManning (2011) suggests that splitting tags seems to be largely a waste of time for the goal of improvingPoS tagging numbers.Instead of splitting, we identify these merged words by using the corresponding STTS-tag for the firstpart and add a plus sign to show that a given word consists of more than one simple word.
There aresequences of words that are commonly joined, but also less common combinations can appear as it de-pends on the preferences of the writer.
A commonly joined sequence is, for instance, VAFIN+PPER,a personal pronoun attached to a finite auxiliary verb, e.g.
hets for German hat es (there is).
An ex-ample for a less commonly joined sequence would be a concatenation of three different parts of speechVVFIN+PIS+PPER such as bruchtmese for the German words braucht man sie (one uses/needs it).
Fig-ure 3 shows some more examples of the most frequent combinations (e.g.
a verb, a conjunction or aparticle followed by a pronoun).
We found 1008 occurrences of merged words, which represent 1.37%of all tokens in the corpus.The STTS-tagset already contains one tag that is a combination of two, namely the APPRART, con-sisting of a preposition APPR and an article ART.
This is used for words like beim, which is composed ofbei and dem.
However, these are ?normal?
Standard German prepositions.
This is not the case with theword combinations in Swiss German writing habits, where any words of completely different parts-of-speech can be merged together.
Using the approach of simply joining the corresponding part-of-speechtags of the words like the APPRART-case, we would end up with an infinite tagset.
Thus, the approach89PoS tag Swiss German Standard German EnglishVAFIN+ isches ist es is itKOUS+ dasme dass man that oneVMFIN+ chame kann man can onePTKZU+ zfl?ug?a zu fliegen to flyADV+ deetobe dort oben up thereTable 3: PoS tags for compound wordsof adding a plus sign allows us to have a clearly defined tagset.
Another advantage is that it is possibleto identify all the concatenated words easily, looking for PoS tags with a ?+?-sign attached.
Once the listof all occurrences is given, the corresponding tags can still be modified according to one?s requirementsfor further processing in a text or corpus.
Moreover, there is not a huge loss of information due to theomitted part-of-speech information for the other word part(s).
For many combinations it is very clearwhich part of speech follows.
Coming across a PTKZU+ for example, the only possibility for the secondpart is a verb in the infinitive, a fact that can be inferred from the grammar.5 Evaluation of PoS TaggingIn order to achieve the best results we trained different statistical, open source PoS taggers: TreeTagger(Schmid, 1995), hunpos tagger (Hal?acsy et al., 2007), RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), Wapiti CRFTagger (Lavergne et al., 2010), TnT (Trigrams?n?Tags) tagger (Brants, 2000) and BTagger (Gesmundoand Samard?zi?c, 2012).
The BTagger and the TnT tagger reach the best results for our corpus, thereforewe did a more detailed evaluation of the tagging results based on these two taggers.5.1 ResultsWe evaluated the performance of the BTagger and the TnT tagger over our corpus with 10-fold crossvalidation.
The folds we created are non-stratified, i.e.
not contiguous sentences.
This is because ourcorpus consists of diverse kinds of text.
If we train the tagger on the whole corpus with diverse kindsof text and then evaluate only on blogs for instance, we will not get a fair result.
Thus, in order to getbalanced test sets, we chose the sentence for the 10 folds randomly.
With the whole corpus as trainingset, we reach an accuracy of 90.62% with the BTagger and 90.14% with the TnT tagger (see table 4).Considering the 26.36% unknown tokens in average over all test sets, the accuracy for the unknowntokens is surprisingly high.Accuracy BTagger TnT taggerUnknown tokens 77.99% 72.39%Known tokens 93.34% 93.26%Overall 90.62% 90.14%Table 4: Accuracy of taggers over the whole corpusAs stated in section 4.1, our corpus contains texts from different genres.
Therefore we additionallyevaluated the different text genres individually.
The results are shown in table 5.
The Wikipedia articlesscore best with 90.92% accuracy.
This is due to the fact that it is the biggest part of the corpus with20,135 tokens (one third).
In addition, the amount of unknown words is not as high as in other textsbecause the variety of different words is limited to one topic per article.
The literary texts are on thesecond place.
This corpus part is only half of the size of the Wikipedia articles.
However, the texts are allextracted from the criminal novels of Viktor Schobinger.
This means, they are written in one dialect byone person, which reduces the number of orthographic varieties and thus the number of unknown tokens.As table 5 shows, the novels have only 16% of unknown tokens, less than all the other parts.Furthermore, we analysed the relation between the size of the corpus and the accuracy we achieved(see figure 1).
In the case of Swiss German we found that the accuracy increases significantly untilapproximately 40,000 tokens.
Increasing the size of the corpus beyond this amount of tokens is helpful90Accuracy Accuracy Accuracy Number ofText type overall unknown tokens known tokens unknown tokensWikipedia articles 90.92% 75.64% 94.60% 22.7%Literary texts (novels) 89.37% 70.41% 92.89% 16.0%Annual report 88.82% 76.95% 92.72% 24.7%Blogs 88.10% 71.69% 91.73% 18.2%Newspaper articles 87.17% 71.19% 93.15% 27.4%Table 5: Results for the different text genres with the BTaggerto cover a larger amount of orthographic varieties and reducing the number of unknown words, but doesnot considerably improve the accuracy of known tokens.Another fact that stands out in figure 1 is the difference of the tagger performances for a training setof 10,000 tokens.
This is due to the fact that that the BTagger makes use of context information andthus emphasises the transition probability by learning sequences of tags.
Therefore, not a huge amountof data is needed to get a comparably good performance (Gesmundo and Samard?zi?c, 2012).
The TnTtagger, on the other hand, emphasises the emission probability and does not generalise as well.Figure 1: Relation between PoS tagging accuracy and corpus size for the TnT tagger (grey line) and theslightly better results from the BTagger (black line).In section 3.1, discussing the differences between Standard German and Swiss German, we arguethat Standard German tools are not capable of dealing with Swiss German dialects.
As an additionalexperiment we extend our Swiss German corpus with a Standard German corpus to see if the addition ofinformation of Standard German data improves the result.
We combined our Swiss German corpus withthe T?uBa-D/Z German Treebank (Telljohann et al., 2006), which contains more than 1,300,000 tokens.The results on a 10-fold cross validation reached an accuracy of 87.6% which is lower than the resultsfor the Swiss German corpus by itself.
This implies that the addition of Standard German training datato our Swiss German corpus is not helpful for the training of a Swiss German PoS tagger.915.2 Error AnalysisThe most frequent errors were the confusion of nouns (NN) and proper names (NE), which representca.
15% of all errors.
This is also a common problem for Standard German due to the capitalisation ofnouns.
The different kinds of adjectives and the adverbs as well as various types of verbs are also oftenmistaken, but these are confusions inside one part-of-speech category.
Furthermore, there are manymistakes between articles and some types of pronouns, especially personal and demonstrative.
However,this is not surprising as they often have the same form.
For example the German indefinite article ein isoften realised as es in Swiss German, the definite article das as s. The Swiss German es also stands forthe German neutral personal pronoun es if it is not abbreviated to s. This issue is exemplified in table 6.PoS tag Swiss German example Standard German EnglishART (definite) es Buech ein Buch a bookART (indefinite) s Buech das Buch the bookPPER Es isch rot.
Es ist rot.
It is red.PPER S r?agnet.
Es regnet.
It is raining.Table 6: Example of the same types with different PoS tags and meanings5.3 Discussion & Future WorkWe achieved reasonable PoS tagging results for the Swiss German dialects considering the low amountof available resources.
As stated in section 3, we are dealing with a dialect continuum missing an orthog-raphy standard.
We neither select one specific dialect (or region) of Switzerland nor do we normalise thedata in any way.
Thus, our data contains a high amount of hapax legomena, i.e.
words which only appearonce.
This fact explains the considerably lower accuracy for unknown tokens compared to taggers forstandardised languages.
Furthermore, we include different sources and different text genres in one cor-pus, which does not simplify the work for a statistical PoS tagger.
Thus, it is conceivable that accuracyimprovements may be achieved by concentrating on one particular dialect.In future work we will enlarge NOAH?s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects by including more textsper dialect in order to reduce the number of unknown tokens.
Another approach we are pursuing isto develop a procedure based on lexical distance measures and syntactical patterns in order to map thedifferent orthographic version of a token, so that the tagger can benefit from these mappings.
Thisprocedure may also serve as a starting point towards the lemmatisation of Swiss German texts.The goal of improving Part-of-Speech tagging for Swiss German as well as extending the corpus is toenable and facilitate the development of further NLP tasks, such as dependency parsing, opinion miningor deeper dialectology studies.6 ConclusionWe have presented our work on compiling a corpus of Swiss German dialects and its application to thetraining of a Part-of-Speech tagger.
As a first resource, our corpus is a stepping stone for natural languageprocessing for the Swiss German dialect area.
Training the BTagger on our corpus results in an accuracyof 90.62%.
With little post processing effort on the tagger output, a PoS-annotated corpus for SwissGerman can be obtained and thus resources extended.NOAH?s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects contains 73,616 tokens from texts of different genres indifferent dialects, manually annotated with PoS tags.
We are happy to share it with interested parties.The corpus including the PoS tags can be downloaded in XML format.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the Institute of Computational Linguistics of the University of Zurich for their support.We would like to thank Martin Volk and Simon Clematide for valuable comments and suggestions.Furthermore, many thanks to Tanja Samard?zi?c for inputs concerning the PoS taggers and David Klaperfor providing some of the raw data for the corpus.92ReferencesThorsten Brants.
