: ,  ~"<,P.>~ o-~ o ' lSakai & Nagao IABSTRACTGeneration of English sentence is realized in the following three steps.First, the generation of kernel sentence by phrase structure rules; second,the application of transformational rules to the kernel sentence; and fina-lly the completion of a sentence by the morphophonemic modifications.At the first stage of generating kernel sentence, the semantics of wordsare fully utilized.
The method is such that a pair of words in the generat-ion process (subject noun and predicate verb, verb and object or complement,sdJective and modified noun etc.)
is selected in accordance with the seman-tic categories which are attached to each word in the word dictionary.
Thesemantic categories are determined by considering both the meaning of wordsthemselves and also the functioning of words in sentences.At the stage of transformational rules, sentence is considered not as asimple string but as the one having the internal tree structure, and thetransformational rules are applied to this tree structure.
For these twostages the generation process is formalized strictly and is realized in acomputer programming.
We have presented in relation to the transformationalrules a method of sentence generation not from the axiom (from th@ top Gfthe tree) but from any point, from which the whole tree is constructed.We have also proposed that the morphophonemic rules can be presented asa kind of operators operating on words in the neighbourhood of a generatedstring.I.
INTRODUCTIONAt present on behalf of the experience obtained from the research alre-ady done, we have fairly exact knowledge about the real difficulties inthe MT research which are to be solved in the near future.
Among theseproblems the most important ones might be how to construct the syntax ofa language and how to grasp the semantics of sentences of the language.There have been many excellent contributions to the problems of syntax,but there are still few to the problems of semantics and the interrelation-ship between syntax and semantics.
We have tried an investigation in thisarea by the method of generation of English sentence.The first paper ever published concerning the generation of sentencesmight have been that by Prof. V.H.
Yngve of MIT in 1961.
We have adoptedthe method once again from the following points of view.
(i) it acts as a powerful test to the study of sentence structure,(ii) " to the study of semantics,(iii) " to the study of the relationship betweensyntax and semantics in natural language.Generally speaking the sentence generation method, contrary to theanalysis of a given sentence (which is guaranteed to be a correct one),tends to demand the severe construction of syntactic rules and word selec-tion rules.
It may seem at the present level of mechanical translationthat the treatment of the sentence property in its entirety is too diffi-cult to realize.
But if we hope to have the translation as perfect asSakai ~ Nagao 2possible, we are necessarily to confront with this problem.The quality of a linguistic theory of a language may be best examinedby the generation of sentences according to the specified linguistic theory.Especially the effect of the interrelationship between syntax and semanticsseems to be clearly exemplified by this so to speak "crude" test.
Thus thesentence generation method surely responds to this overall treatment of thesentence property.
This may be considered as a step towards the generaltheory of natural language.2.
EVALUATION OF THE GENERATED SENTENCE2.1 Evaluation of the generated sentence -syntax-Several methods are developed for the description of sentence structure.We represent the syntax of English by a phrase structure grammar, transfor-mational grammar, and mophophonemic rules.
The kernel sentence is generatedby the phrase structure grammar, then some proper transformational rulesare applied to it, and then the modification of the sentence by the morpho-phonemic rules produces the final output.These rules should generate "conceivable sentence structures", althoughthe actually used sentence structures have several constraints.
These arefor example,(i) the depth of the sentence structure(ii) the coordination structure(iii) the intrinsic unsymmetry of sentence structure --- progressive struc-ture, top heavy structure etc.In general the rules which are suitable for analysis of a given sentenceseem to differ from the rules which generate good sentences.
The differencebetween these two is the difference between the actual spoken sentences andthe conceivable sentences.
Here we can see man's tendency to the languagestructure.
Therefore it will not be worthless to know the frequency ratiosof the phrases used in the actual sentences.2.2 Evaluation of the generated sentence -semantics-The next question, and the more difficult one than the former, is thedetermination of what is the proper meaningful sentence.
The test for thesemantic sentence anomaly is far more difficult than the test for thegrammaticality of the sentence.
Here we can think of the following threelevels of criteria for the right sentence.
(i) The grammatical sentence which is spoken or written by the averageperson (and the sentence which conveys a concrete concept withoutknowing the circumstances the sentence is spoken).
Here "grammatical"covers the phonology, phonemics, morphology, syntax etc.
These sen-tence which are grammatical but which are contradictory in meaningand which we do not speak are to be rejected.
(ii) The sentences which are incomplete in the word usages, inflexionsand so on but which convey clear understandable concepts.
These arethe so-called corrigible sentences.
(iii) The sentences which are grammatical but carry no concrete meaningSakai & Nagao 3if they are not supplemented by tediously long explanations aboutthe righteousness of the expression.We have here  adopted  the  second c r i te r ion  fo r  our  generat ion  o f  Eng l i shsentences .
That  i s  because  we can t rans form the cor r ig ib le  sentences  in tothe complete  ones comparat ive ly  eas i ly  by check ing  the  concordance o fgender ,  number, case e tc .
Hereaf te r  we are  main ly  concerned  wi th  the  sen-tence  which car r ies  very  de f in i te  concept ,  that  i s  to  say,  the sentence  o fcomplete  semant ic  cons is tency .3.
SENTENCE GENERATION BY SEMANTIC CONCORDANCEWe concentrate our efforts on the generation of the affirmative activedeclarative sentences.
We try to generate this kernel sentence by theexpansion rules.
By the generation of the kernel sentence the attention ison the structural balance of the whole sentence, the influence of the choiceof a word to the other part of the phrase, and their relation to the unifiedconcept of the sentence.
An expansion rule has a main constituent and theother non-main constituents in the expanded part.
The latter symbols maycontain optional elements.When an expansion rule is applied to a non-terminal symbol, to whichthere is already given a concrete word, the word is assigned to the mainconstituent of the expanded part.
The words to the non-main constituentsymbols are selected in relation to the main constituent word.
A verb ora noun is taken as the main constituent of the non-terminal symbol "sentence"(initial symbol).3.

j is attached 1,2,3,.. fromleft to right to the non-main constituents of string ~ .If ~ is  composed of only one symbol, there is no non-mainconstituent.Optional elements in the expansion rules are indicated by a pair ofbrackets attached to the symbols.
An optional element in ~ can not be themain constituent.The type of selection rules:s -*  w or  s ~-~wSemi-terminal derivation:Expansion rules are applied on non-terminal symbols, to the stage wherethere is no symbol to be expanded.
The final string is composed of SWC.A set of the derived main constituents for a symbol z:A set of all the SWC which can be the main constituent of a non-terminalsymbol z or the main constituents of a phrase which is generated by succes-sive expansions of the main constituents of the original z.S(z) = (s,, , s~z ,  ..... )S(s~ ) ~ (s~) is assumed.3.2 The process of generation of a kernel sentence (I)We suppose that a sentence has one central thing or concept to be menti-oned first of all.
This is the main constituent of a sentence.
Then asecond important concept is determined with its grammatical position,referring to the central concept already selected.
Next a third importantone is determined likewise, and so on.
This process is formally representedin the following.
(i) Zo +~ w(s~ (Zo))s~(zo) is an element of S(zo) which is the set of the derived main consti-tuents for zo.
W(SL(Zo)) is a word belonging to the set W(s~(zo)).
Thisshows the process starts from the selection of a word w for the axiomz o , and the sentence is to be constructed with the core word w.(ii) z0 -~ , if s?
(z , )6S(MCZ) )The axiom z o can be expanded into the syntactic unit ~ if and only ifthe already selected s{(zo) at the stage (i) is contained in the set ofthe derived main constituents for M(~) .
(iii) M(~)*-*wCsz(zo))The already selected word w(sL(za)) is assigned to the main constituentM(2~) of the expanded syntactic un i t l .

I.
The double line indicatesthe main constituent of a phrase symbol which is written one line above.Certain semantic conditions are imposed on the pair of phrase names in aphrase, which are underlined.3.4 The process of generation of a kernel sentence (II)The generation process explained in 3.2 is from the axiom.
But there arethe cases where we want to construct a sentence from arbitrary grammaticalpositions and a given word.
For example when we write a complex sentencelike "The old gentleman whom we saw at the theatre was his father.
", themain constituent of the subordinate clause is not "gentleman", but the verb"saw".
So we must generate a sentence from a noun "gentleman" and itsgrammatical position: objective case.The process is that first the start point of generation is given by aword and its part of speech in a sentence.
Next we select a proper rewriti~mrule which contains the part of speech of the word selected Just now.
Thento the remaining elements of the rewritten phrase the proper words areassigned, the semantic categories of which coincide with the one of thealread~ selected word.
This process is continued as far as there remainsno element which can be rewritten by a phrase.
The process is formallyrepresented in the following.
(i) Given z, w, s, where s4-~w, s e S(z)(ii) A tree structure whose top symbol is z is constructed by the methodexplained in 3.2.
(iii) z'--~ ~ , Z = fz,'~ .... z-.. 2z~.A phrase z' is selected which contains z as a component of the expan-sion rule ~ ' -~2.Sakai & Nagao 6(iv) z+~w, Pz :* -~,  i = 1,2, ...... ,nwhere certain conditionis satisfied.A proper word is corresponded to each phrase P~.
(v) Tree structures whose top symbols are Pz~ (i = 1,2, ... ) are const-ructed for all ~ by the method mentioned in 3.2.
(vi) At the stage (iii), z' is newly replaced by z and the same operationsfrom stage (iii) to (v) are performed.
(vii) When z' = zo(axiom) is reached and the steps (iv) to (v) are completed,then the whole tree is accomplished under the axiom z o.An example of this process is illustrated in Fig.
2.
The directionindicates the steps the sentence is constructed.4.
TRANSFORMATIONAL RULES4.1 Representation of the rulesThe transformational rules can explain many sentence structures whichare difficult to treat in an immediate constituent method.
For example inthe sentence "Is he young?
", which is a question form of "He is young","is young" becomes discontinuous, separated by "he".
This is difficult totreat by an immediate constituent method.
It is far more natural to explainthis by the application of a transformational rule concerning question tothe original affirmative sentence.The transformational rules we are now utilizing are classified to threetypes.
The type 1 is unary transformations which may be thought of as con-verting a sentence from one to another, The type 2 is binary transformationswhich combine two sentences to form a third.
And the type 3 is a transfor-mation between two phrases.
In all these cases we can formally representthe transformational rules as the following type.z : XI'X~ ....... X~-~y l" X~,-yI" X~y .......... y~.X~y~+~.
(I)The symbol z which is written on the left side means that this transfor-mational rules should be applied to the phrase z. Xi, Xs, ..... , X~areeither the elements of M or words themselves.
Among them we have a specialsymbol ~, which indicates that for this symbol ~, there might or might notcorrespond some term in a~investigated phrase z ?
That is, ~ expresses anarbitrary term.
Y,, Y:, ..... , Y~i are vacant, some symbols or words whichare not equal to X| , X~, ..... , X,.
XL, , X~,, ...... , X~ are some symbolsamong Xi, XA, ..... , X~.The phrase z may have an internal tree structure, so the transformationalrule is applied to this tree.
An example of this is illustrated in Fig.
3.In this figure a noun phrase "the red books" is transformed to another nounphrase "the books which are red".
This transformation is done by the rule,NPI: ~.AD.NQ ---~@-NQ-WHICH BE.ADThere are problems in the transformational rules such as follows.
(i) We have no definite criteria as to what kind of sentence structure isSakai & Nagao 7to be treated in the scope of phrase structure grammar, and what is in thescope of transformational rules.
(ii) We can name empirically or informally the transformational rules suchas passive, that deletion, compl~ment/obJect transposition, etc., but torepresent these rules formally in the form of (1) without contradiction forall the sentence structures generated from the specified phrase structuregrammar, is difficult.
(iii) Transformations which accompany the changes in the part of speech orthe morphophonemic forms of words are difficult to treat.
(iv) A transformational rule can not be applied unconditionally to thestructure satisfying the rule form, but there are many cases where theapplication of rules depend on the semantics of the sentence.4.2 Application of transformational rulesFor the transformational rules of the type 1, we generate a sentence bythe phrase structure grammar and at the same time memorize the generationsteps of the sentence by the tree structure representation.
Next we applya transformational rule of the type I to this tree.
If the rule is foundto fit to the structure, then another tree is constructed from the originaltree referring to the transformational rule.Examples of this type are:~.NP.VT-NPI.~ --~ 1.4.BE-3.BY-2-5 (passive form)This book emphasized the recent development clearly.--* The recent development be emphasize(d) by this book clearly.~-NP.VI2.NPI.~ --~ I.WHAT-DO-2.3-5-?
(question)Last year John became a doctor of philosophy at thirty.- -*Last  year what do John become at thirty?The application of morphophonemic rules to these transformed sentences areexplained in ?
6.For the transformational rules of the type 2, we generate first a sentenceby the phrase structure grammar, with its internal tree structure.
Then weselect a proper phrase name which is a proper branch point of the tree, withthe word attached to the phrase name.
Next we start the generation of ano-ther sentence starting with the phrase name and the corresponding word, whichare selected just now.
This generation is by the method explained in 3.4.Then the two sentences thus generated have a same word, which is the keypoint in the usual transformational rules of type 2.An example of this type is illustrated in Fig.
4.
This is a combinationof two sentences of Fig.
I and Fig.
2.
The rule applied here is,SS: ~-WT1.NPI-~.CM.
NPI.~ ~ 1.2.3.WHICH-7.4and the generated sentence isSeveral most number computer already precede specialist into trend whichread the paper.This example indicates that a transformational rules can not be applied inevery case, even if the structure satisfies the rule form.
There are manyother examples of this nature.For the transformational rules of the type 3, we have mainly concernedwith the noun phrases which are the results of the application of transfor-mational rules to certain phrases, especially to the sentence form SE.For example,Sakai & Nagao 8NP1.BE.NP1 ~ 1-CM.3-CMKennedy is the president of the U.S.--~ Kennedy, the president of the U.S.,NPI.BE.PP ~ 1-3Scientists are in the dome of the south poleScientists in the dome of the south pole.This type of transformational rules are incorporated in the generation bythe phrase structure grammar.Another important transformational rules are those which accompany thechange in the part of speech of words.For example,VTI.NPI-~ ~ nn -1-PRP-2-3apply computer to the MT researchapplication of computer to the MT researchVT1-NPI.
@ ~ nn-l. BE GIVEN T0.2-3consider the problems of the theory--~ consideration is given to the problems of the theoryWe have not investigated yet this type of transformational rules exceptfew ones, in which the word dictionary should have information about theinterchange of the parts of speech.5.
SEMANTIC CATEGORIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN SYNTACTIC UNITIn the generation process thus defined, each word is determined by theselection rule s~--~ w applied to SWC's.
How this word selection shouldbe done is the semantics here considered.
If the selection is done randomlywithout any semantic restriction, completely anomalous sentence will appear.To prevent this a new word is to be selected compatible with the alreadyselected words which are in the neighborhood.
Such semantic selection ofwords will especially Be important in the syntactic relations such assubject noun & predicate verbsubject noun & predicate verb & complement (or object)adjective modifier & nounnoun & noun !adjective & adjective I (coordination structure)verb & verbetc.Selection of a proper word in relation to the other words will eventuallyrequire the semantic notifications to the words and their mutual relation-ship in a sentence.
In other words the system of semantic categories is tobe set up and the meanings of all the words are to be represented in thesystem.The construction of a system of the semantic categories may be donebest by the replaceability relation among words in sentences.
For example,to the verb "walk", there is a group of words which can be the subject tothe verb "walk".
To the word group thus formed, there will be another wordgroup which can be the predicate and has a verb "walk" as its member.
Thisword classification has not been tried yet on the whole scale, and indeedSakai & Nagao 9this is very difficult to do.
So we have done a slightly different way,although the fundamental attitude of our word categorization is the repla-ceahility of words in sentences.We postulate that all the words might be properly characterized by settingup a number of key concepts.
For example a word "voyage" is categorized asjourney with the additional images such as amusement, time duration, oceanetc.
In fact when we speak we actually construct sentences fully aware ofsuch additional meanings.Thus our aim is to extract such word images and to know how these imagesare mutually connected in such and such sentence structures.
So we havestarted the extraction of semantic categories partly taking into consider-ation the Roget's thesaurus and some other publications.
We have assignedthe following numbers to the semantic categories of the parts of speech.100--299 verb300--499 noun500--699 adjective700--799 adverb900-- prepositionThe ten's digit indicates the rough semantic categories in a part of speechand the one's digit is to the further classifications.
At present thenumber of categories for the verbs ia about 40, for the nouns about 90,for the adjectives about 50, etc.
For the prepositions we have attached anumber to each word.
These semantic categories are shown in table I.Next we have to clarify the connectivity of words in a sentence.
To dothis we have attached several kind of semantic categories to each word inthe following way.Verb:PI:P2:P3:P4:PS:P6:Noun:PI:categories intrinsic to the verb.categories which can modify the verb (additional images of the verb)categories which can stand as subject to the verb.categories which can stand as object or complement to the verb.special prepositions following the verb if any.grammatical indication as to the form of the verb.categories intrinsic to the noun.P2: categories which can modify the noun (additional images of the noun)P3: grammatical indication as to the form of the noun.Adjective:P1 :P2:P3:Adverb:Pl:categories intrinsic to the adjective.categories which can modify the adjective (additional images ofthe adjective)prepositions following the predicative adjective.categories intrinsic to the adverb.This expresses, for example, that a verb can take  a noun for the  subjectwhose semantic c~tegories P1 belong to the P3 of the verb, and can take anoun for the object or complement whose semantic categories PI belong tothe P4 of the verb, etc.
These are the conditions/~ introduced in 3.3.Examples of words having these connectivity informations are shownin table 2.Sakai & Nagao 10The generation process is thus first the selection of a verb, and thenthe determination of subject, object or complement referring to the semanticconcordance mentioned here.
Therefore each expansion rule of the phrasestructure grammar has the indication such asSE- -~NP< P1,P3~.VT__~I.NP1 <P1,P4>-PRP< Pl,P5 >-NPINP--~ ADJ< P1,P2 >-NQInthis example VT1, NQ which are underlined are the main constituents towhich some concrete words are selected.
So for NP, NP1, PRP and ADJ, properwords are to be assigned having the semantic concordance between the pairof categories bracketed by < > .
The first element in < > is the categoryof the phrase to the left of < , and the second element is that of the mainconstituent.
Therefore a word is assigned to NP, whose semantic categoriesP1 have the same term in the P3 of VTI, and so on.But there are many grammatical phrases where we can not tell what kindof semantic relationship are to be established.
We have not attached thesemantic relationship to the phrases like,main verb : adverbial phrases preceded by prepositionmain sentence : subordinate clausenoun : its adjectival clauseetc.It is also difficult to find out the semantic relationship between the nounsof the form,NO + NO, NO + NO + NO, NO of NOsuch as,machine translation, information processing machinegeneration of sentences.However when these phrases are given from suitable transformations ofanother phrases such assolution of a problem .-.solve a problem,generation of sentences.--, generate sentences,we can establish the semantic relationship of these two noun in the phrasebefore the transformation is applied.
In this case we have to know the nounform of a verb or its vice versa.
This information is contained in the worddictionary as P6 for the verb and as P3 for the noun.The semantic relationship here introduced is essentially the connectivitybetween two words in a phrase, so there is a possibility of generating absurdsentences.
To prevent this we have to know more minute mutual influence ofmeanings among words in a sentence.6.
MORPHOPHONEMIC RULESWe want to propose that the morphophonemic rules can be represented bya kind of operators operating on the words in the neighborhood.
We includenegation action, tense, case etc.
to this level.
We take the operatorssuch as follows.
(not), ~r (present tense), ~s (past tense)inf (infinitive), ~ (third person singular), pl (plural)su'~ (subjective casej, ob~ (objective case)Sakai & Nagao 11ing (ing-form of a verb), ed (past participle)nn (nominalization of a verb)~- etc.The functions of these operators are,n + verb ~ do + not + verbmn + aux.
verb---~ aux.
verb + notwpr + verb-- ,  verb (present form)ps + verb --~ verb (past form)ing + verb--~verb (gerund or present participle)ed + verb --.
verb (past participle) etc.Besides these, for the verb BE(R) and HAVE(~), the following three stepsare to be applied in this order.
(I) ~ + ~ + verb---, be + being + e d + verb(2) ~ + verb---, be + in~ + verb(3) h + be --.
have beenFor example in the generation of a sentence shown in Fig.
5, the sentenceobtained initially is# the father sg sub~ ~ enjoy fresh breeze sg obj #Here the following operationsare applied.s_~ oh__/---, ob~ s_~, s_~# ---~ #noun ~ ---.
noun, ~ enjoy ~ be + in~ + enjoyin~ + enjoy---~ enjoying, ~ + be ~ have beenSg sub--~ subs~,  sg have---~ hasnoun sub ~ nounAnd we can get the final form,# the father has been enjoying fresh breeze #These operators can appear both in the phrase structure grammar and inthe transformational rules, but the operations of these are supposed to bedone after the application of transformational rules.
But there occur manycomplicated situations for the sentences after the application of transfor-mational rules and to what extent we can go on this line remains to be seenin the future.7.
EXPERIMENTSWe are doing experiments on sentence generation by a medium size compu-ter KDC-I installed in our university.
The word size is about 450 (verbabout 140, noun about 170, adjective about 80, adverb about 40, etc.)
Thephrase structure rules are about 80 of the form z--~F,.~ .... F~(max.
ofn = 5 at present).
The rules include the optional terms so that effectivelythe number of rules increases.The transformational rules are now only fundamental ones such as,negation, passive transform, several kind of question form, nominalizationof phrases, several kind of binary transformations, etc.We treat the sentences such asS+V+O,+O~S+V+O+Cby the binary transformation from two sentences of the form,Sakai & Nagao 12S + V + X : X z 01 have 02S + V + X : X = 0 be CS+V+Oi+O~S+V+O+CExamples of generated sentences:Working to set for new present-day of area be abroad.To correspond to only research, different monograph work, be above suchits branch of difficulty.To be being between selection invitation to assemble, a completely immensetechnique be to know desirable boundary.Of widely digital elimination of number, view of summary question whicharise to be automatic here satisfy his directly attractivesubject at only impossible reference.We think that this study of sentence generation of English suggestssomething to the translation technique to English from Japanese which hasno sentence structure like English.In parallel to this study we are now experimenting just the reverse pro-cedure of sentence generation.
That is, we are trying to decompose a givensentence into several semantic units or set of kernels.
This process willclarify in a subjective sense the amount of information contained in agiven original sentence.
Moreover this will contribute very much to thefield of information retrieval and also to the clarification of the logicof a discource, such as question-answer problem.(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)REFERENCESV.H.
