The Effect of  P i tch  Accent ing  on Pronoun Referent  Reso lu t ionJ anet  CahnMassachuset ts  Ins t i tu te  of  Techno logyCambr idge ,  MA 02139USAcahn~media .mi t .eduAbst ractBy strictest interpretation, theories of bothcentering and intonational meaning failto predict the existence of pitch accentedpronominals.
Yet they occur felicitouslyin spoken discourse.
To explain this, Iemphasize the dual functions served bypitch accents, as markers of both propo-sitional (semantic/pragmatic) and atten-tional salience.
This distinction underliesmy proposals about the attentional conse-quences of pitch accents when applied topronominals, in particular, that while mostpitch accents may weaken or reinforce acospecifier's status as the center of atten-tion, a contrastively stressed pronominalmay force a shift, even when contraindi-cated by textual features.In t roduct ionTo predict and track the center of attention in dis-course, theories of centering (Grosz et al, 1983;Brennan et al, 1987; Grosz et al, 1989) and im-mediate focus (Sidner, 1986) rely on syntactic andgrammatical features of the text such as pronominal-ization and surface sentence position.
This may besufficient for written discourse.
For oral discourse,however, we must also consider the way intonationaffects the interpretation ofa sentence, especially thecases in which it alters the predictions of centeringtheories.
I investigate this via a phenomenon that,by the strictest interpretation of either centering orintonation theories, should not occur - -  the case ofpitch accented pronominals.Centering theories would be hard pressed to pre-dict pitch accents on pronominals, on grounds ofredundancy.
To bestow an intonational marker ofsalience (the pitch accent) on a textual marker ofsalience (the pronominal) is unnecessarily redundantand especially when textual features correctly pre-dict the focus of attention.Intonational theories would be similarly hardpressed, but on grounds of information quality andefficient use of limited resources.
Given the serialand ephemeral nature of speech and the limits ofworking memory, it is most expedient o mark assalient the information-rich nonpronominals, ratherthan their semantically impoverished pronominalstand-ins.
To do otherwise is an injudicious use ofan attentional cue.However, when uttered with contrastive stress onthe pronouns,(I) John introduced Bill as a psycholinguistand then HE insulted HIM.
(after Lakoff, 1971) is felicitously understood tomean that after a slanderous introduction, Bill re-taliated in kind against John.What makes (1) felicitous is that the pitch ac-cents on the pronominals contribute attentional in-formation that cannot be gleaned from text alone.This suggests an attentional component to pitch ac-cents, in addition to the propositional componentexplicated in Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990).In this paper, I combine their account of pitch ac-cent semantics with Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein's(1989) account of centering to yield insights into thephenomenon of pitch accented pronominals, and theattentional consequences of pitch accents in general.The relevant claims in PH90 and GJW89 are re-viewed in the next two sections.P i tch  accent  semant icsA pitch accent is a distinctive intonational con-tour applied to a word to convey sentential stress(Bolinger, 1958; Pierrehumbert, 1980).
PH90 cata-logues six pitch accents, all combinations of high (H)and low (L) pitch targets, and structured as a maintone and an optional eading or trailing tone.
Theform of the accent - -  L, H, L+H or H+L - -  informsabout the operation that would relate the salientitem to the mutual beliefs 1 of the conversants; themain tone either commits (H*) or fails to commit1 Mutual beliefs: propositions expressed or implied bythe discourse, and which all conversants believe eachother to accept as true and relevant same (Clark andMarshall, 1981).290(L*) to the salience of the proposition itself, or therelevance of the operation.?
H* predicates a proposition as mutually be-lieved, and proclaims its addition to the set ofmutual beliefs; L* fails to predicate a proposi-tion as mutually believed.
As PH90 points out,failure to predicate has contradictory sources:the proposition has already been predicated asmutually believed; or, the speaker, but not thehearer, is prevented from predication (perhapsby social constraints); or the speaker activelybelieves the salient proposition to be false.?
H+L evokes an inference path.
H*+L commitsto the existence of inference path that wouldsupport the proposition as mutually believed,indicates that it can be found or derived fromthe set of mutual beliefs; H+L* conveys uncer-tainty about the existence of such a path.?
L+H evokes a scale or ordered set to which theaccented constituent belongs: L+H* commitsto the salience of the scale, and is typically usedto convey contrastive stress; L*+H also evokesa scale but fails to commit to its salience, e.g.,conveying uncertainty about the salience of thescale with regard to the accented constituent.Center ing  s t ructures  and  operat ionsTo explain how speakers move an entity in and outof the center of \[mutual\] attention, GJW89 formal-izes attentional operations with two computationalstructures - -  the forward.looking center list (Cf) andthe backward-looking center (the Cb).
Cf is a par-tially ordered list of centering candidates; 2 the Cb,at the head of Cf, is the current center of attention.After each utterance, one of three operations arepossible:* The Cb retains both its position at the head ofCf and its status as the Cb; therefore it contin-ues as the center in the next utterance.?
The Cb retains its centered status for the cur-rent utterance but its rank is lowered - -  it nolonger resides at the head of Cf and thereforeceases to be the center in the next utterance.?
The Cb loses both its centered status and rank-ing in the current utterance as attention shiftsto a new center.In addition, GJW89 constrains pronominalizationsuch that no element in an utterance can be real-ized as a pronoun unless the Cb is also realized as apronoun, and imposes a preference ordering for op-erations on Cf, such that the least reordering is al-ways preferred.
That is, a sequence of continuations2For simplicity's ake, we assume the items in Cf to bewords and phrases; in actuality, they may be nonlexicalrepresentations of concepts, or some hybrid of lexical,conceptual nd sensory data.is preferred over a sequence of retentions, which ispreferred over a sequence of shifts.When in tonat ion  and  center ing  co l l ideMy synthesis of the claims in PH90 and GJW89 pro-duces an attentional interpretation of pitch accents,modeled by operations on Cf, and derived for eachaccent from their corresponding propositional effectas described in PH90.The corollaries for pitch accented pronominals are:(1) when a pitch accent is applied to a pronominal,its main effect is attentional, on the order of itemsin Cf; (2) the obligation to accent a pronominal forattentional r~asons depends on the variance betweenwhat the text predicts and what the speaker wouldlike to assert about the order of items in Cf.These hypotheses arise from the following chain ofassumptions:(1) To analyze the effects of pitch accents onpronominals, it is necessary to distinguish betweenattentional and propositional salience.
Attentionalsalience measures the degree to which an item issalient, expressible as a partial ordering, e.g., itsranking in Cf.
It is a quantitative feature.
In con-trast, propositional salience, addressing an item'sstatus in relation to mutual beliefs, is qualitative.It is calculated through inference chains that linksemantic and pragmatic propositions.Both attentional (Cf) and propositional (mu-tual beliefs) structures are updated throughout.However, unlike attentional structures which areephemeral in various time scales and empty at theend of the discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), mu-tual beliefs persist throughout the conversation, pre-serving at the end the semantic and pragmatic out-come of the discourse.In addition, while propositions can be excludedfrom the mutual beliefs because they fail to meetsome inclusion criterion, no lexical denotation is ex-cluded from Cf regardless of its propositional value.This is because the salience most relevant o the at-tentional state is the proximity of a discourse ntityto the head of Cf - -  the closer it is, the more it iscentered and therefore, attentionally salient.
(2) Pitch accents on pronominals are primarilyinterpreted for what they say about attentionalsalience.
One determiner of whether attentionalor propositional effects are dominant is the type ofinformation provided by the accented constituent.Because nonpronominals contribute discourse con-tent, pitch accented nonpronominals are mainly in-terpreted with respect o the mutual beliefs, that is,for their propositional content.
However, pronomi-nals, with little intrinsic semantics, perform primar-ily an attentional function.
Therefore pitch accentedpronominals are mainly interpreted with respect oCf, for their attentional content.
(3) The specific attentional consequences of each291pitch accent on pronominals can be extrapolated byanalogy from the propositional interpretations inPHgO, by replacing mutual beliefs with Cf as thesalient set.
Thus,?
H* indicates instantiation of the pronominal'scospecifier as the Cb, while L* fails to instanti-ate it as the Cb;?
The partially ordered set (salient scale) invokedby L+H is Cf;?
The inference path evoked by H+L is, for at-tentional purposes, a traversal of Cf.
(~) And therefore, the attentionai effect of pitch ac-cents can be formally expressed as an effect on theorder of items in Cf.From these assumptions, I derive the following at-tentional consequences for pitch accented pronomi-nals:?
Only one pitch accent, L+H*, selects aCb otherthan that predicted by centering theory andthereby reorders Cf.?
L*+H appears to support an impending re-ordering but does not compel it.?
By analogy, the remaining pitch accents, seemto either weaken or strengthen the current cen-ter's Cb status, but do not force a reordering.Ava i lab i l i ty  o f  cospec i f ie rsThe attentional interpretations are constrained bywhat has been mutually established in the prior dis-course, or is situationally evident.
Therefore, whilecontrastive stress may be mandated when grammat-ical features elect he wrong cospecifier, the accent-ing is only felicitous when there is an alternate ref-erent available.For example, in(2) John introduced Bill as a psycholinguistand then he/,+//, insulted him.L+H* indicates that he no longer cospecifies withJohn.
If the hearer is hasty, she might select B i l las the new Cb.
However, this is not borne outby the unaccented him, which continues to cospec-ify with Bi l l .
Since he and him cannot select thesame referent, he requires a cospecifier that is nei-ther John nor B?11.
Because, the utterance itselfdoes not provide a any other alternatives, heL+g, isonly felicitous (and coherent) if an alternate cospec-ifier has been placed in Cf by prior discourse, or bythe speaker's concurrent deictic gesture towards adiscourteous male.Conc lus ion  and  Future  WorkBy combining Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's(1990) analysis of intonational meaning with Grosz,Joshi and Weinstein's (1989) theory of centering indiscourse, the attentional ffect of pitch accents be-comes evident, and the paradox of pitch accentedpronominals unravels.
My goal here is to develop ananalysis and a line of inquiry and to suggest that myderivative claims are plausible, and even extensibleto an attentional nalysis of pitch accents on non-pronominals.
The proof, of course, will come frominvestigation by multiple means - -  constructed ex-amples (e.g., Cahn, 1990), computer simulation, em-pirical analysis of speech data (e.g., Nakatani, 1993),and psycholinguistic experiments.Re ferencesDwight Bolinger.
