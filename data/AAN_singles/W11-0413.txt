Science,Indiana University,Bloomington, USAmabdulma@indiana.eduMona T. DiabCenter for Computational Learning Systems,Columbia University,NYC, USAmdiab@ccls.columbia.eduAbstractSubjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) isan area that has been witnessing a flurryof novel research.
However, only few at-tempts have been made to build SSA systemsfor morphologically-rich languages (MRL).
Inthe current study, we report efforts to par-tially bridge this gap.
We present a newlylabeled corpus of Modern Standard Arabic(MSA) from the news domain manually an-notated for subjectivity and domain at the sen-tence level.
We summarize our linguistically-motivated annotation guidelines and provideexamples from our corpus exemplifying thedifferent phenomena.
Throughout the paper,we discuss expression of subjectivity in nat-ural language, combining various previouslyscattered insights belonging to many branchesof linguistics.1 IntroductionAs the volume of web data continues to phenome-nally increase, researchers are becoming more inter-ested in mining that data and making the informa-tion therein accessible to end-users in various inno-vative ways.
As a result, searches and processingof data beyond the limiting level of surface wordsare becoming increasingly important (Diab et al,2009).
The sentiment expressed in Web data specif-ically continues to be of high interest and value tointernet users, businesses, and governmental bodies.Thus, the area of Subjectivity and sentiment analysis(SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel research.Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects oflanguage used to express opinions, feelings, eval-uations, and speculations (Banfield, 1982; Wiebe,1994) and it, thus, incorporates sentiment.
The pro-cess of subjectivity classification refers to the taskof classifying texts into either Objective (e.g., Morethan 1000 tourists have visited Tahrir Square, indowntown Cairo, last week.)
or Subjective.
Sub-jective text is further classified with sentiment or po-larity.
For sentiment classification, the task refersto identifying whether a subjective text is positive(e.g., The Egyptian revolution was really impres-sive!
), negative (e.g., The bloodbaths that took placein Tripoli were horrifying!
), neutral (e.g., The com-pany may release the software next month.
), and,sometimes, mixed (e.g., I really like this labtop, butit is prohibitively expensive.).
SSA sometimes in-corporates identifying the holder(s), target(s), andstrength (e.g., low, medium, high) of the expressedsentiment.In spite of the great interest in SSA, only fewstudies have been conducted on morphologically-rich languages (MRL) (i.e., languages in which sig-nificant information concerning syntactic units andrelations are expressed at the word-level (Tsarfatyet al, 2010)).
Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Czech, andBasque are examples of MRLs.
SSA work on MRLshas been hampered by lack of annotated data.
In thecurrent paper we report efforts to manually anno-tate a corpus of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), amorphologically-rich variety of Arabic, e.g., (Diabet al, 2007; Habash et al, 2009).
The corpus is acollection of documents from the newswire genrecovering several domains such as politics and sports.We label the data at the sentence level.
Our annota-tion guidelines explicitly incorporate linguistically-motivated information.110The rest of the paper is organized as follows: InSection 2, we motivate work on the news genre.In Section 3, we summarize our linguistically-motivated annotation guidelines.
In Section 4, weintroduce the domain annotation task.
In Section 5we provide examples from our dataset.
We presentrelated work in Section 6.
We conclude in Section 7.2 Subjectivity and Sentiment in the NewsMost work on SSA has been conducted on data be-longing to highly subjective, user-generated genressuch as blogs and product or movie reviews whereauthors express their opinions quite freely (Balahurand Steinberger, 2009).
In spite of the importantrole news play in our lives (e.g., as an influencerof the social construction of reality (Fowler, 1991),(Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999), (Wodak andMeyer, 2009)), the news genre has received muchless attention within the SSA community.
This roleof news and the connection between news-makingand social contexts and practices motivates the taskof building SSA system.
In addition, the many novelways online news-making is becoming an interactiveprocess (Abdul-Mageed, 2008) further motivatesinvestigating the newswire genre.
News-makers re-produce some of the views of their readers (e.g., byquoting them) and they devote full stories about theinteractions of web users on social media outlets1.Although subjectivity in news articles has tradition-ally tended to be implicit, the fact that news sto-ries have their own biases (e.g., hiding agents be-hind negative or positive events via use of passivevoice, variation in lexical choice) has been pointedout by e.g., (Van Dijk, 1988).
The growing trend tofoster interactivity and more heavily report commu-nication of internet users within the body of newsarticles is likely to make expression of subjectivityin news articles more explicit.3 Subjectivity and Sentiment Annotation(SSA)Two graduate level educated native speakers of Ara-bic annotated 2855 sentences from Part 1 V 3.0 of1This trend has increased especially in Arab news organi-zations like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya with the hightened at-tention to social media as a result of ongoing revolutions andprotests in the Arab worldOBJ S-POS S-NEG S-NEUT TotalOBJ 1192 21 57 11 1281S-POS 47 439 2 3 491S-NEG 69 0 614 6 689S-NEUT 115 2 9 268 394Total 1423 462 682 288 2855Table 1: Agreement for SSA sentencesthe Penn Arabic TreeBank (PATB) (Maamouri et al,2004).
The sentences make up the first 400 docu-ments of that part of PATB amounting to a total of54.5% of the PATB Part 1 data set.
The task wasto annotate MSA news articles at the sentence level.Each article has been processed such that coders areprovided sentences to label.
We prepared annotationguidelines for this SSA task focusing specifically onthe newswire genre.
We summarize the guidelinesnext, illustrating related and relevant literature.3.1 SSA CategoriesFor each sentence, each annotator assigned one of 4possible labels: (1) Objective (OBJ), (2) Subjective-Positive (S-POS), (3) Subjective-Negative (S-NEG),and (4) Subjective-Neutral (S-NEUT).
We followed(Wiebe et al, 1999) in operationalizing the subjec-tive vs. the objective categories.
In other words,if the primary goal of a sentence is perceived to bethe objective reporting of information, it was labeledOBJ.
Otherwise, a sentence would be a candidate forone of the three subjective classes.2 Table 1 showsthe contingency table for the two annotators judg-ments.
Overall agreement is 88.06%, with a Kappa(k) value of 0.38.To illustrate, a sentence such as ?The Prime Min-ister announced that he will visit the city, sayingthat he will be glad to see the injured?, has two au-thors (the story writer and the Prime Minister indi-rectly quoted).
Accordingly to our guidelines, thissentence should be annotated S-POS tag since thepart related to the person quoted (the Prime Minis-2It is worth noting that even though some SSA researchersinclude subjective mixed categories, we only saw such cate-gories attested in less than < 0.005% which is expected sinceour granularity level is the sentence.
If we are to consider largerunits of annotation, we believe mixed categories will becomemore frequent.
Thus we decided to tag the very few subjectivemixed sentences as S-NEUT.111ter) expresses a positive subjective sentiment, ?glad?which is a private state (i.e., a state that is not sub-ject to direct verification) (Quirk et al, 1974).3.2 Good & Bad NewsNews can be good or bad.
For example, whereas?Five persons were killed in a car accident?
is badnews, ?It is sunny and warm today in Chicago?
isgood news.
Our coders were instructed not to con-sider good news positive nor bad news negative ifthey think the sentences expressing them are objec-tively reporting information.
Thus, bad news andgood news can be OBJ as is the case in both exam-ples.3.3 PerspectiveSome sentences are written from a certain perspec-tive (Lin et al, 2006) or point of view.
Considerthe two sentences (1) ?Israeli soldiers, our heroes,are keen on protecting settlers?
and (2) ?Palestinianfreedom fighters are willing to attack these Israelitargets?.
Sentence (1) is written from an Israeli per-spective, while sentence (2) is written from a Pales-tinian perspective.
The perspective from which asentence is written interplays with how sentiment isassigned.
Sentence (1) is considered positive froman Israeli perspective, yet the act of protecting set-tlers is considered negative from a Palestinian per-spective.
Similarly, attacking Israeli targets may bepositive from a Palestinian vantage point, but will benegative from an Israeli perspective.
Coders wereinstructed to assign a tag based on their understand-ing of the type of sentiment, if any, the author of asentence is trying to communicate.
Thus, we havetagged the sentences from the perspective of theirauthors.
As it is easy for a human to identify theperspective of an author (Lin et al, 2006), this mea-sure facilitated the annotation task.
Thus, knowingthat the sentence (1) is written from an Israeli per-spective the annotator assigns it a S-POS tag.3.4 Epistemic ModalityEpistemic modality serves to reveal how confidentwriters are about the truth of the ideational mate-rial they convey (Palmer, 1986).
Epistemic modal-ity is classified into hedges and boosters.
Hedgesare devices like perhaps and I guess that speakersemploy to reduce the degree of liability or respon-sibility they might face in expressing the ideationalmaterial.
Boosters3 are elements like definitely, I as-sure that, and of course that writers or speakers useto emphasize what they really believe.
Both hedgesand boosters can (1) turn a given unit of analsysisfrom objective into subjective and (2) modify polar-ity (i.e., either strengthen or weaken it).
Consider,for example, the sentences (1) ?Gaddafi has mur-dered hundreds of people?, (2) ?Gaddafi may havemurdered hundreds of people?, and (3) ?Unfortu-nately, Gaddafi has definitely murdered hundreds ofpeople?.
While (1) is OBJ, since it lacks any subjec-tivity cues), (2) is S-NEUT because the propositionis not presented as a fact but rather is softened andhence offered as subject to counter-argument, (3) isa strong S-NEG (i.e., it is S-NEG as a result of theuse of ?unfortnately?, and strong due to the use ofthe booster definitely).
Our annotators were explic-itly alerted to the ways epistemic modality markersinteract with subjectivity.3.5 Illocutionary Speech ActsOccurrences of language expressing (e.g.
apologies,congratulations, praise, etc.
are referred to as il-locutionary speech acts (ISA) (Searle, 1975).
Webelieve that ISAs are relevant to the expression ofsentiment in natural language.
For example, the twocategories expressives (e.g., congratulating, thank-ing, apologizing and commisives (e.g., promising)of (Searle, 1975)?s taxonomy of ISAs are speciallyrelevant to SSA.
In addition, (Bach and Harnish,1979) define an ISA as a medium of communicat-ing attitude and discuss ISAs like banning, bidding,indicting, penalizing, assessing and convicting.
Forexample, the sentence ?The army should never dothat again?
is a banning act and hence is S-NEG.Although our coders were not required to assign ISAtags to the sentences, we have brought the the con-cept of ISAs to their attention as we believe a goodunderstanding of the concept facilitates annotatingdata for SSA.3.6 Annotator?s Background KnowledgeThe type of sentiment expressed may vary basedon the type of background knowledge of an annota-3 (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) call these intensifiers.112Domain # of CasesPolitics 1186Sports 530Military & political violence 435Disaster 228Economy 208Culture 78Light news 72Crime 62This day in history 56Total 2855Table 2: Domainstor/reader (Balahur and Steinberger, 2009).
For ex-ample, the sentence ?Secularists will be defeated?,may be positive to a reader who opposes secularism.However, if the primary intention of the author isjudged to be communicating negative sentiment, an-notators are supposed to assign a S-NEG tag.
In gen-eral, annotators have been advised to avoid interpret-ing the subjectivity of text based on their own eco-nomic, social, religious, cultural, etc.
backgroundknowledge.4 Domain AnnotationThe same two annotators also manually assignedeach sentence a domain label.
The domain labels arefrom the news genre and are adopted from (Abdul-Mageed, 2008).
The set of domain labels is as fol-lows: {Light news, Military and political violence,Sport, Politics, Crime, Economy, Disaster, Arts andculture, This day in history}.
Table 2 illustrates thenumber of sentences deemed for each domain.
Do-main annotation is an easier task than subjectivityannotation.
Inter-annotator agreement for domainlabel assignment is at 97%.
The two coders dis-cussed differences and a total agreement was even-tually reached.
Coders disagreed most on cases be-longing to the Military and political violence andPolitics domains.
For example, the following isa case where the two raters disagreed (and whichwas eventutally assigned a Military and political vi-olence domain):@PYJ?A?

Later, the two annotators agreed to assign itan S-NEUT tag.6 Related WorkThere are a number of datasets annotated for SSA.Most relevant to us is work on the news genre.
(Wiebe et al, 2005) describe a fine-grained newscorpus manually labeled for SSA5 at the word andphrase levels.
Their annotation scheme involvesidentifying the source and target of sentiment aswell as other related properties (e.g., the intensity ofexpressed sentiment).
Our work is less fine grainedon the one hand, but we label our data for domain aswell as subjectivity.
(Balahur et al, 2009) report work on labelingquotations from the news involving one person men-tioning another entity and maintain that quotationstypically contain more sentiment expressions thanother parts of news articles.
Our work is differentfrom that of (Balahur et al, 2009) in that we labelall sentences regardless whether they include quota-tions or not.
(Balahur et al, 2009) found that enti-ties mentioned in quotations are not necessarily thetarget of the sentiment, and hence we believe thatSSA systems built for news are better if they focuson all the sentences of articles rather than quotationsalone (since the target of sentiment may be outsidethe scope of a quotation, but within that of the sen-tence to which a quotation belongs)..The only work on Arabic SSA we are aware of isthat of Abbasi et al (2008) who briefly describe la-beling a collection of documents from Arabic Webforums.
(Abbasi et al, 2008)?s dataset, however, isnot publicly available and detailed information as tohow the data was annotated is lacking.
Our work isdifferent from (Abbasi et al, 2008)?s in that we la-bel instances at the sentence level.
We believe thatdocuments contain mixtures of OBJ and SUBJ casesand hence sentence-level annotation is more fine-grained.
In addition, (Abbasi et al, 2008) focuson a specific domain of ?dark Web forums?.7 ConclusionIn this paper, we present a novel annotation layer ofSSA to an already labeled MSA data set, the PATBPart 1 ver.
3.0.
To the best of our knowledge, thislayer of annotation is the first of its kind on MSAdata of the newswire genre.
We will make that col-lection available to the community at large.
We mo-tivate SSA for news and summarize our linguistics-motivated guidelines for data annotation and provideexamples from our data set.5They use the term private states (Quirk et al, 1974) torefer to expressions of subjectivity.117ReferencesA.
