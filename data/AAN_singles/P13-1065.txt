Tony.Veale@gmail.com li.guofu.l@gmail.com       Abstract Just as observing is more than just see-ing, comparing is far more than mere matching.
It takes understanding, and even inventiveness, to discern a useful basis for judging two ideas as similar in a particular context, especially when our perspective is shaped by an act of linguis-tic creativity such as metaphor, simile or analogy.
Structured resources such as WordNet offer a convenient hierarchical means for converging on a common ground for comparison, but offer little support for the divergent thinking that is needed to creatively view one concept as another.
We describe such a means here, by showing how the web can be used to harvest many divergent views for many familiar ideas.
These lateral views com-plement the vertical views of WordNet, and support a system for idea exploration called Thesaurus Rex.
We show also how Thesaurus Rex supports a novel, genera-tive similarity measure for WordNet.
1 Seeing is Believing (and Creating) Similarity is a cognitive phenomenon that is both complex and subjective, yet for practical reasons it is often modeled as if it were simple and objec-tive.
This makes sense for the many situations where we want to align our similarity judgments with those of others, and thus focus on the same conventional properties that others are also likely to focus upon.
This reliance on the consensus viewpoint explains why WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has proven so useful as a basis for compu-tational measures of lexico-semantic similarity(e.g.
see Pederson et al 2004, Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006; Seco et al 2006).
These measures reduce the similarity of two lexical concepts to a single number, by viewing similarity as an objec-tive estimate of the overlap in their salient quali-ties.
This convenient perspective is poorly suited to creative or insightful comparisons, but it is sufficient for the many mundane comparisons we often perform in daily life, such as when we or-ganize books or look for items in a supermarket.
So if we do not know in which aisle to locate a given item (such as oatmeal), we may tacitly know how to locate a similar product (such as cornflakes) and orient ourselves accordingly.
Yet there are occasions when the recognition of similarities spurs the creation of similarities, when the act of comparison spurs us to invent new ways of looking at an idea.
By placing pop tarts in the breakfast aisle, food manufacturers encourage us to view them as a breakfast food that is not dissimilar to oatmeal or cornflakes.
When ex-PM Tony Blair published his memoirs, a mischievous activist encouraged others to move his book from Biography to Fiction in bookshops, in the hope that buyers would see it in a new light.
Whenever we use a novel meta-phor to convey a non-obvious viewpoint on a topic, such as ?cigarettes are time bombs?, the comparison may spur us to insight, to see aspects of the topic that make it more similar to the vehi-cle (see Ortony, 1979; Veale & Hao, 2007).
In formal terms, assume agent A has an in-sight about concept X, and uses the metaphor X is a Y to also provoke this insight in agent B.
To arrive at this insight for itself, B must intuit what X and Y have in common.
But this commonality is surely more than a standard categorization of X, or else it would not count as an insight about X.
To understand the metaphor, B must place X660in a new category, so that X can be seen as more similar to Y. Metaphors shape the way we per-ceive the world by re-shaping the way we make similarity judgments.
So if we want to imbue computers with the ability to make and to under-stand creative metaphors, we must first give them the ability to look beyond the narrow view-points of conventional resources.
Any measure that models similarity as an ob-jective function of a conventional worldview employs a convergent thought process.
Using WordNet, for instance, a similarity measure can vertically converge on a common superordinate category of both inputs, and generate a single numeric result based on their distance to, and the information content of, this common generaliza-tion.
So to find the most conventional ways of seeing a lexical concept, one simply ascends a narrowing concept hierarchy, using a process de Bono (1970) calls vertical thinking.
To find nov-el, non-obvious and useful ways of looking at a lexical concept, one must use what Guilford (1967) calls divergent thinking and what de Bono calls lateral thinking.
These processes cut across familiar category boundaries, to simultaneously place a concept in many different categories so that we can see it in many different ways.
de Bono argues that vertical thinking is selec-tive while lateral thinking is generative.
Whereas vertical thinking concerns itself with the ?right?
way or a single ?best?
way of looking at things, lateral thinking focuses on producing alternatives to the status quo.
To be as useful for creative tasks as they are for conventional tasks, we need to re-imagine our computational similarity measures as generative rather than selective, ex-pansive rather than reductive, divergent as well as convergent and lateral as well as vertical.
Though WordNet is ideally structured to support vertical, convergent reasoning, its comprehensive nature means it can also be used as a solid foun-dation for building a more lateral and divergent model of similarity.
Here we will use the web as a source of diverse perspectives on familiar ide-as, to complement the conventional and often narrow views codified by WordNet.
Section 2 provides a brief overview of past work in the area of similarity measurement, be-fore section 3 describes a simple bootstrapping loop for acquiring richly diverse perspectives from the web for a wide variety of familiar ideas.
These perspectives are used to enhance a Word-Net-based measure of lexico-semantic similarity in section 4, by broadening the range of informa-tive viewpoints the measure can select from.Similarity is thus modeled as a process that is both generative and selective.
This lateral-and-vertical approach is evaluated in section 5, on the Miller & Charles (1991) data-set.
A web app for the lateral exploration of diverse viewpoints, named Thesaurus Rex, is also presented, before closing remarks are offered in section 6.
2 Related Work and Ideas WordNet?s taxonomic organization of noun-senses and verb-senses ?
in which very general categories are successively divided into increas-ingly informative sub-categories or instance-level ideas ?
allows us to gauge the overlap in information content, and thus of meaning, of two lexical concepts.
We need only identify the deepest point in the taxonomy at which this con-tent starts to diverge.
This point of divergence is often called the LCS, or least common subsumer, of two concepts (Pederson et al, 2004).
Since sub-categories add new properties to those they inherit from their parents ?
Aristotle called these properties the differentia that stop a category sys-tem from trivially collapsing into itself ?
the depth of a lexical concept in a taxonomy is an intuitive proxy for its information content.
Wu & Palmer (1994) use the depth of a lexical concept in the WordNet hierarchy as such a proxy, and thereby estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as twice the depth of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual depths.
Leacock and Chodorow (1998) instead use the length of the shortest path between two con-cepts as a proxy for the conceptual distance be-tween them.
To connect any two ideas in a hierarchical system, one must vertically ascend the hierarchy from one concept, change direction at a potential LCS, and then descend the hierar-chy to reach the second concept.
(Aristotle was also first to suggest this approach in his Poetics).
Leacock and Chodorow normalize the length of this path by dividing its size (in nodes) by twice the depth of the deepest concept in the hierarchy; the latter is an upper bound on the distance be-tween any two concepts in the hierarchy.
Negat-ing the log of this normalized length yields a corresponding similarity score.
While the role of an LCS is merely implied in Leacock and Cho-dorow?s use of a shortest path, the LCS is pivotal nonetheless, and like that of Wu & Palmer, the approach uses an essentially vertical reasoning process to identify a single ?best?
generalization.
Depth is a convenient proxy for information content, but more nuanced proxies can yield661more rounded similarity measures.
Resnick (1995) draws on information theory to define the information content of a lexical concept as the negative log likelihood of its occurrence in a corpus, either explicitly (via a direct mention) or by presupposition (via a mention of any of its sub-categories or instances).
Since the likelihood of a general category occurring in a corpus is higher than that of any of its sub-categories or instances, such categories are more predictable, and less informative, than rarer categories whose occurrences are less predictable and thus more informative.
The negative log likelihood of the most informative LCS of two lexical concepts offers a reliable estimate of the amount of infor-mation shared by those concepts, and thus a good estimate of their similarity.
Lin (1998) combines the intuitions behind Resnick?s metric and that of Wu and Palmer to estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as an information ratio: twice the information content of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual information contents.
Jiang and Conrath (1997) consider the con-verse notion of dissimilarity, noting that two lex-ical concepts are dissimilar to the extent that each contains information that is not shared by the other.
So if the information content of their most informative LCS is a good measure of what they do share, then the sum of their individual information contents, minus twice the content of their most informative LCS, is a reliable estimate of their dissimilarity.
Seco et al (2006) presents a minor innova-tion, showing how Resnick?s notion of infor-mation content can be calculated without the use of an external corpus.
Rather, when using Res-nick?s metric (or that of Lin, or Jiang and Con-rath) for measuring the similarity of lexical concepts in WordNet, one can use the category structure of WordNet itself to estimate infor-mation content.
Typically, the more general a concept, the more descendants it will possess.
Seco et al thus estimate the information content of a lexical concept as the log of the sum of all its unique descendants (both direct and indirect), divided by the log of the total number of con-cepts in the entire hierarchy.
Not only is this in-trinsic view of information content convenient to use, without recourse to an external corpus, Seco et al show that it offers a better estimate of in-formation content than its extrinsic, corpus-based alternatives, as measured relative to average hu-man similarity ratings for the 30 word-pairs in the Miller & Charles (1991) test set.
A similarity measure can draw on othersources of information besides WordNet?s cate-gory structures.
One might eke out additional information from WordNet?s textual glosses, as in Lesk (1986), or use category structures other than those offered by WordNet.
Looking beyond WordNet, entries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are not only connected by a dense topology of lateral links, they are also organized by a rich hierarchy of overlapping categories.
Strube and Ponzetto (2006) show how Wikipedia can support a measure of similarity (and related-ness) that better approximates human judgments than many WordNet-based measures.
Nonethe-less, WordNet can be a valuable component of a hybrid measure, and Agirre et al (2009) use an SVM (support vector machine) to combine in-formation from WordNet with information har-vested from the web.
Their best similarity measure achieves a remarkable 0.93 correlation with human judgments on the Miller & Charles word-pair set.
Similarity is not always applied to pairs of concepts; it is sometimes analogically applied to pairs of pairs of concepts, as in proportional analogies of the form A is to B as C is to D (e.g., hacks are to writers as mercenaries are to sol-diers, or chisels are to sculptors as scalpels are to surgeons).
In such analogies, one is really as-sessing the similarity of the unstated relationship between each pair of concepts: thus, mercenaries are soldiers whose allegiance is paid for, much as hacks are writers with income-driven loyalties; sculptors use chisels to carve stone, while sur-geons use scalpels to cut or carve flesh.
Veale (2004) used WordNet to assess the similarity of A:B to C:D as a function of the combined simi-larity of A to C and of B to D. In contrast, Tur-ney (2005) used the web to pursue a more divergent course, to represent the tacit relation-ships of A to B and of C to D as points in a high-dimensional space.
The dimensions of this space initially correspond to linking phrases on the web, before these dimensions are significantly reduced using singular value decomposition.
In the infamous SAT test, an analogy A:B::C:D has four other pairs of concepts that serve as likely distractors (e.g.
singer:songwriter for hack:writer) and the goal is to choose the most appropriate C:D pair for a given A:B pair-ing.
Using variants of Wu and Palmer (1994) on the 374 SAT analogies of Turney (2005), Veale (2004) reports a success rate of 38?44% using only WordNet-based similarity.
In contrast, Tur-ney (2005) reports up to 55% success on the same analogies, partly because his approach aims662to match implicit relations rather than explicit concepts, and in part because it uses a divergent process to gather from the web as rich a perspec-tive as it can on these latent relationships.
2.1 Clever Comparisons Create Similarity Each of these approaches to similarity is a user of information, rather than a creator, and each fails to capture how a creative comparison (such as a metaphor)  can spur a listener to view a topic from an atypical perspective.
Camac & Glucks-berg (1984) provide experimental evidence for the claim that ?metaphors do not use preexisting associations to achieve their effects [?]
people use metaphors to create new relations between concepts.?
They also offer a salutary reminder of an often overlooked fact: every comparison ex-ploits information, but each is also a source of new information in its own right.
Thus, ?this cola is acid?
reveals a different perspective on cola (e.g.
as a corrosive substance or an irritating food) than ?this acid is cola?
highlights for acid (such as e.g., a familiar substance)    Veale & Keane (1994) model the role of simi-larity in realizing the long-term perlocutionary effect of an informative comparison.
For exam-ple, to compare surgeons to butchers is to en-courage one to see all surgeons as more bloody, crude or careless.
The reverse comparison, of butchers to surgeons, encourages one to see butchers as more skilled and precise.
Veale & Keane present a network model of memory, called Sapper, in which activation can spread between related concepts, thus allowing one con-cept to prime the properties of a neighbor.
To interpret an analogy, Sapper lays down new acti-vation-carrying bridges in memory between ana-logical counterparts, such as between surgeon & butcher, flesh & meat, and scalpel & cleaver.
Comparisons can thus have lasting effects on how Sapper sees the world, changing the pattern of activation that arises when it primes a concept.
Veale (2003) adopts a similarly dynamic view of similarity in WordNet, showing how an ana-logical comparison can result in the automatic addition of new categories and relations to WordNet itself.
Veale considers the problem of finding an analogical mapping between different parts of WordNet?s noun-sense hierarchy, such as between instances of Greek god and Norse god, or between the letters of different alphabets, such as of Greek and Hebrew.
But no structural similarity measure for WordNet exhibits enough discernment to e.g.
assign a higher similarity toZeus & Odin (each is the supreme deity of its pantheon) than to a pairing of Zeus and any other Norse god, just as no structural measure will as-sign a higher similarity to Alpha & Aleph or to Beta & Beth than to any random letter pairing.
A fine-grained category hierarchy permits fine-grained similarity judgments, and though WordNet is useful, its sense hierarchies are not especially fine-grained.
However, we can auto-matically make WordNet subtler and more dis-cerning, by adding new fine-grained categories to unite lexical concepts whose similarity is not reflected by any existing categories.
Veale (2003) shows how a property that is found in the glosses of two lexical concepts, of the same depth, can be combined with their LCS to yield a new fine-grained parent category, so e.g.
?su-preme?
+ deity = Supreme-deity (for Odin, Zeus, Jupiter, etc.)
and ?1st?
+ letter = 1st-letter (for Alpha, Aleph, etc.)
Selected aspects of the textual similarity of two WordNet glosses ?
the key to similarity in Lesk (1986) ?
can thus be reified into an explicitly categorical WordNet form.
3 Divergent  (Re)Categorization To tap into a richer source of concept properties than WordNet?s glosses, we can use web n-grams.
Consider these descriptions of a cowboy from the Google n-grams (Brants & Franz, 2006).
The numbers to the right are Google fre-quency counts.
a lonesome cowboy   432  a mounted cowboy   122  a grizzled cowboy     74  a swaggering cowboy     68 To find the stable properties that can underpin a meaningful fine-grained category for cowboy, we must seek out the properties that are so often pre-supposed to be salient of all cowboys that one can use them to anchor a simile, such as "swag-gering like a cowboy?
or ?as grizzled as a cow-boy?.
So for each property P suggested by Google n-grams for a lexical concept C, we gen-erate a like-simile for verbal behaviors such as swaggering and an as-as-simile for adjectives such as lonesome.
Each is then dispatched to Google as a phrasal query.
We value quality over size, as these similes will later be used to find diverse viewpoints on the web via bootstrapping.
We thus manually filter each web simile, to weed out any that are ill-formed, and those intended to be seen as ironic by their authors.
This gives us a body of 12,000+ valid web similes.663Veale (2011, 2012, 2013) notes that web uses of the pattern ?as P as C?
are rife with irony.
In contrast, web instances of ?P S such as C?
?
where S denotes a superordinate of C ?
are rarely ironic.
Hao & Veale (2010) exploit this fact to filter ironic comparisons from web similes, by re-expressing each ?as P as C?
simile as  ?P * such as C?
(using a wildcard * to match any val-ues for S) and looking for attested uses of this new form on the web.
Since each hit will also yield a value for S via the wildcard *, and a fine-grained category P-S for C, we use this approach here to harvest fine-grained categories from the web from most of our similes.
Once C is seen to be an exemplary member of the category P-S, such as cola in fizzy-drink, a targeted web search is used to find other mem-bers of P-S, via the anchored query ?P S such as * and C?.
For example, ?fizzy drinks such as * and cola?
will retrieve web texts in which * is matched to soda or lemonade.
Each new member can then be used to instantiate a further query, as in ?fizzy drinks such as * and soda?, to retrieve other members of P-S, such as champagne and root beer.
This bootstrapping process runs in successive cycles, using doubly-anchored pat-terns that ?
following Kozareva et al (2008) and Veale et al (2009) ?
explicitly mention both the category to be populated (P-S) and a recently acquired member of this category (C).
As cautioned by Kozareva et al, it is reckless to bootstrap from members to categories to members again if each enfilade of queries is like-ly to return noisy results.
A reliable filter must be applied at each stage, to ensure that any member C that is placed in a category P-S is a sensible member of the category S. Only by filtering in this way can we stop the rapid accumulation of noise.
For instance, a WordNet-based filter dis-cards any categorization ?P S such as X and C?
where X does not denote a WordNet entry for which S does not denote a valid hypernym.
Such a filter offers no creative latitude, however, since it forces every pairing of C and P-S to precisely obey WordNet?s category hierarchy.
We thus use instead the near-miss filter described in Veale et al (2009), in which X must denote a descendant of some direct hypernym of some sense of S. The filter does not (and cannot) determine whether P is salient for X.
It merely assumes that if P is sa-lient for C, it is salient for X.
Five successive cycles of bootstrapping are performed, using the 12,000+ web similes as a starting point.
Consider cola: after 1 cycle, we acquire 14 new categories, such as effervescent-beverage and sweet-beverage.
After 2 cycles we acquire 43 categories; after 3 cycles, 72; after 4 cycles, 93; and after 5 cycles, we acquire 102 fine-grained perspectives on cola, such as stimu-lating-drink and corrosive-substance.Figure 1.
Fine-grained perspectives for cola found by Thesaurus Rex on the web.
See also Figures 3 and 4.
These alternative viewpoints, for a broad array of concepts, are gleaned from the collective intelli-gence of the web.
Some are more discerning and informative than others ?
see for instance war & divorce in Figure 4 ?
though as de Bono (1971) notes, lateral thinking does not privilege a nar-row set of ?correct?
viewpoints, rather it gener-ates a broad array of interesting alternatives, none of which are ever ?wrong?, even if some prove more useful than others in a given context.
4 Measuring and Creating Similarity Which perspectives will be most useful and in-formative to a WordNet-based similarity metric?
Simply, a perspective M-Cx  for a concept Cy can be coherently added to WordNet iff Cx de-notes a hypernym of some sense of Cy in Word-Net.
For purposes of quantifying the similarity of two terms t1 and t2 ?
by finding the WordNet senses of these terms that exhibit the highest sim-ilarity ?
we can augment WordNet with the per-spectives on t1 and t2 that are coherent with WordNet?s hierarchy.
So for t1=cola & t2=acid, corrosive-substance offers a coherent new per-spective on each, slotting in beneath the match-ing WordNet sense of substance.
A category system is a structured feature space.
We estimate the similarity of C1 and C2 as the cosine of the angle between the feature vec-tors that are constructed for each.
The dimen-sions of these vectors are the atomic hypernyms (direct or indirect) of C1 and C2 in WordNet; the value of a dimension H in a vector is the infor-mation content (IC) of the WordNet hypernym H:664size(H)        ?c ?
WN  size(c)) Here size(H) is the total number of lexical con-cepts in category H in WordNet, excluding any instance-level concepts, as these illustrative indi-viduals are not evenly distributed across Word-Net categories.
We also want any fine-grained perspective M-H to influence our similarity metric, provided it can be coherently tied into WordNet as a shared hypernym of the two lexical concepts being compared.
The absolute information content of a category M-H  that is newly added to WordNet is given by (2):size(M-H)    ?m-h ?
WN  size(m-h)) where size(M-H) is the number of lexical con-cepts in WordNet for which M-H can be added as a new hypernym.
The denominator in (2) de-notes the sum total of the size of all fine-grained categories that can be coherently added to WordNet for any term.
The IC of M-H relative to H is estimated via the geometric mean of ICabs(M-H) and IC(H) is given by (3): (3)  IC(M-H)    =   ?
ICabs(M-H) .
IC(H) For a shared dimension H in the feature vectors of concepts C1 and C2, if at least one fine-grained perspective M-H has been added to WordNet between H and C1 and between H and C2, then the value of dimension H for C1 and for C2 is given by (4):  (4)  weight(H)   = max(IC(H),  maxM IC(M-H)) When no shared perspective M-H can be added under H, then weight(H) = IC(H).
A fine-grained perspective M-H will thus influence a similarity judgment between C1 and C2 only if M-H can be coherently added to WordNet as a hypernym of C1 and C2, and if M-H enriches our view of H. Unlike Resnick (1995), Lin (1998) and Seco et al (2006), this vector-space approach does not hinge on the information content of a single LCS, so any shared hypernym H or perspective M-H can shape a similarity judgment according to its informativeness.5 Empirical Evaluation  Many fascinating perspectives on familiar ideas are bootstrapped from the web using similes as a starting point.
These perspectives drive an ex-ploratory web-aid to lateral thinking we call The-saurus Rex, while the cosine-distance metric constructed from WordNet and these many fine-grained categories is called, simply, Rex.
When Rex provides a numeric estimate of similarity for two ideas, Thesaurus Rex provides an enhanced insight into why these ideas are similar, e.g.
by explaining that cola & acid are not just substanc-es, they are corrosive substances.
We evaluate Rex by estimating how closely its judgments correlate with those of human judges on the 30-pair word set of Miller & Charles (M&C), who aggregated the judgments of multi-ple human raters into mean ratings for these pairs.
We evaluate three variants of Rex on M&C: Rex-lat, which combines WordNet with all of Thesaurus Rex; Rex-wn, which uses only WordNet, with nothing at all from Thesaurus Rex; and Rex-pop, which enriches WordNet with only popular perspectives from Thesaurus Rex.
A perspective is considered popular if it is dis-covered 5 or more times in the bootstrapping process, using 5 different anchors.
While corro-sive-substance is a popular category for acid, it not so for cola or juice.
Popularity thus approxi-mates what Ortony (1979) calls salience.

* As re-evaluated by Seco et al (2006) for all 30 pairs Table 1 lists coefficients of correlation (Pear-son?s r) with mean human ratings for a range of WordNet-based metrics.
Table 1 includes the hybrid WordNet+web+SVM metric of Agirre et al (2009) ?
who report a correlation of .93 ?
and the Mutual-Information-based PMImax metric of Han et al (2009).
The latter achieves good re-sults for 27 of the 30 M&C pairs by enriching a PMI metric with an automatically-generated the-saurus.
Yet while informative, this thesaurus is(               )((2)  ICabs(M-H) =  -log(1)   IC(H)             =     - log665not organized as an explanatory system of hier-archical categories as it is in Thesaurus Rex.
Rex-wn does no better than Seco et al (2006) on the M&C dataset, suggesting that Rex?s vec-tors of IC-weighted hypernyms are no more dis-cerning than a single informative LCS.
However, such vectors also permit Rex to incorporate addi-tional, fine-grained perspectives from Thesaurus Rex, allowing Rex-lat in turn to achieve a com-parable correlation to that of Li et al (2003) ?
.89.
Yet the formulation in (2) favors unusual or idiosyncratic perspectives that are unlikely to generalize across independent judges.
The mean ratings of M&C are the stuff of consensus, not individual creativity, and outside the realm of creative metaphor it often makes sense to safely align our judgments with those of others.
By limiting its use of Thesaurus Rex to the perspectives that other judges are most likely to use, Rex-pop obtains a correlation of .93 with mean human ratings on all 30 M&C pairs.
This result is comparable to that reported by Agirre et al (2009), who use SVM-based supervised learning to combine the judgments of two met-rics, one based on WordNet and another on the analysis of web contexts of both input terms.
However, Rex has the greater capacity for in-sight, since it augments the structured category system of WordNet with structured categories of its own.
At each level of the WordNet hierarchy, Rex finds the fine-grained category that can best inform its judgments.
Because Rex makes highly selective use of the diverse products of lateral thinking, this selectivity also produces concise explanations for its judgments.
5.1 Generative Uses of Similarity A similarity metric offers a numerical measure of how closely one idea can cluster with another.
It can also indicate how well one object may serve as a substitute for another, as when a letter open-er is used as a knife, or tofu is used instead of meat.
This need for substitution can be grist for creativity, yet most similarity metrics can only assess a suggested substitution, rather than sug-gest one for themselves.
If they are to actively shape a creative decision, our similarity metrics must be made more generative.
A similarity metric can learn to be generative, by observing how people typically cluster words and ideas that are made similar by their contexts of use.
The Google 3-grams contain many in-stances of the clustering pattern ?X+s and Y+s?, as in ?cowboys and pirates?
or ?doctors and law-yers?, and so a comprehensive trawl yields manyinsights into the pairings of ideas that we implic-itly see as comparable.
We harvest all such Google 3-grams, to build a symmetric compara-bility graph in which any two comparable terms are adjacent nodes.
For any node, we can gener-ate a diverse set of comparable ideas just by reading off its adjacent nodes.
Thesaurus Rex can be used to find an embracing category for many such pairs of nodes, while Rex estimates the sim-ilarity of any two adjacent nodes.
A comparabil-ity graph of 28,000 nodes is produced from the Google 3-grams, with a sparse adjacency matrix of just 1,264,827 (0.16%) non-zero entries.
Is this dense enough for a task requiring gen-erative similarity?
Almuhareb & Poesio (2004) describe one such task: they sample 214 words from across 13 WordNet categories, and ask if these 214 words can be partitioned into 13 clus-ters that mirror the WordNet categories from which they were drawn.
They then collect tens of thousands of web contexts for these 214 words, to extract a feature representation of each.
We instead use Rex to generate, as features, a diverse set of comparable terms for each word.
(We also assume that each word is a feature of itself).
The Rex comparability graph suggests a pool of 8,300 features for all 214 words.
The clustering toolkit CLUTO is used to partition the original 214 words into 13 clusters guided only by these com-parability features.
The resulting 13 clusters have an average purity of 93.4% relative to WordNet, suggesting that categorization tasks which re-quire implicit comparability judgments are well served by a generative approach to similarity.
5.2 Learning From Similarity Judgments  Rex augments the narrow worldview of WordNet with the more diverse viewpoints it gleans from the web, not by viewing them as separate knowledge sources, but by actually updating WordNet itself.
The relative performance of Rex-pop > Rex-lat > Rex-wn on the M&C da-taset shows that selective use of a divergent per-spective permits WordNet to better serve its popular role as a judge of similarity.
It is worth asking then whether these passing additions to WordNet should not be made permanent.
Rex estimates a similarity score for each of the 1,264,827 pairings of comparable terms it finds in the Google 3-grams.
These scores are then cached to support generative similarity, and to permit fast lookup of scores for common com-parisons.
This lookup table is a lightweight means of using Rex in a range of creative substi-tution or generation tasks.
Though the table is666sparse, ?5.1 shows that it implicitly captures key nuances of category structure.
The 39,826 unique fine-grained categories added by Rex-pop (ver-sus the 44,238 categories added by Rex-lat) in the course of its 1,264,827 comparisons thus suggest credible enhancements to WordNet.
Fig-ure 2 graphs the distribution of new categories and their membership sizes when Rex-pop is used on this scale.Figure 2.
The number of new categories (Y-axis) with a given membership size (X-axis) added to WordNet when Rex-pop/lat are used on a large, web scale.
The Goldilocks categories are those that are not so small as to lack generality, and not so large as to lack information content.
For example, Rex-pop suggests the addition of 15,125 new fine-grained categories to WordNet with membership sizes ranging from 5 to 25.
This is a large but manageable number of categories that should be further considered for future addition to Word-Net, or indeed to any similarly curated knowledge resource.
6 Summary and Conclusions de Bono (1970) argues that the best solutions arise from using lateral and vertical thinking in unison.
Lateral thinking is divergent and genera-tive, while vertical thinking is convergent and analytical.
The former can thus be used to create a pool of interesting candidates for the latter to selectively consider.
Thesaurus Rex uses the web to generate a rich pool of alternate perspectives on familiar ideas, and Rex selects from this pool to perform vertical reasoning with WordNet to yield precise similarity judgments.
Rex also uses the most informative perspective to concisely explain each comparison, or ?
when used in gen-erative mode ?
to suggest a creative comparison.
For instance, to highlight the potential toxicity of coffee, Thesaurus Rex suggests comparisons with alcohol, tobacco or pesticide, as all have been categorized as toxic substances on the web.
A web app based on Thesaurus Rex, to support thiskind of lateral thinking, is accessible online at this URL: http://boundinanutshell.com/therex2 Screenshots from the Thesaurus Rex application are provided in Figures 3 and 4 overleaf.
Be-cause Thesaurus Rex targets the acquisition of fine-grained perspectives, ranging from the off-beat to the obvious, it acquires an order-of-magnitude more categories from the web than can be found in WordNet itself.
Rex dips selec-tively into this wealth of perspectives (and Rex-pop is more selective still), though many of Rex?s needs can be anticipated by looking to how ideas are implicitly grouped into ad-hoc catego-ries (Barsalou, 1983) in constructions such as ?X+s and Y+s?.
Using the Google n-grams as a source of tacit grouping constructions, we have created a comprehensive lookup table that pro-vides Rex similarity scores for the most common (if often implicit) comparisons.
Comparability is not the same as similarity, and a non-zero similarity score does not mean that two concepts would ever be considered comparable by a human.
This poses a problem for the generation of sensible comparisons.
However, Rex?s lookup table captures the implic-it pragmatics of comparability, making Rex usa-ble in generative tasks where a metric must both suggest and evaluate comparisons.
Human simi-larity mechanisms are evaluative and generative, convergent and divergent.
Our computational mechanisms should be no less so.
