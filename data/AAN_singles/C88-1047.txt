A majoradvantage of this sort; of computational approach is that it canmention dymmlic aspects of phenomena, such as i;emporal or-der of processing and structural ambiguity a~ising dynamicallyin tit<', course of comprehending or producing utterances.Linguistics, by coutrast, has paid littk, a{,tention to Goscaspects and has limited itself t;() investigation of characteristicsof langttage whid~ could bc tMked about in static terms.

l)ifferentapproaches to syntax assume a dislocated element o addition-ally corresl)ond to diffel:em, sets of positions ttegweetl he fillerand the gap.
In generM, tra:mlk>rmatioual grammars tend {;opostulate fewer such positions than do phrase.struchu:e gram..2~\]nars (PSGs, hereafter, which include, among others, GPSG'GKPS 1985/and IIPSG/Pollard 1984, 1935/) or LFG/Bres-lau 1982/.
Also, these theories assign different status to dislo-:ated elements; %'ansformational grammarians talk about themLs if they 'move' through sentence structure, while the othersLssumes they are simply 'associated with' grammatical cate-;ories, via such means as the SLASH feature.Such differences among various approaches to syntax, how-~ver, is irrelevant o the discussion in the rest of the papaer.Ne shall exploit no hypothesis specific to any of these syntactic.heories, so that our discussion will be neutral across them, Werill borrow some useful terminology and metaphors from spe-:ific grammar theories, but that is only for explanatory ease,md should not be taken to be any commitment to any of such~pproaches.
The above description of passing, for instance,:cads as if a dislocate lement were part of grammatical cate-gories, and hence might well remind the reader of PSGs.
This~y no means implies that we should abandon transformational~ccounts in favor of PSGs.
Although PSGs are neutral with re-spect to the temporal order of processing, incidentally, we shall~ometimes talk about passing as the dislocated element going?om the mother to a daughter, reflecting the temporal order of~ctual sentence processing; el.
transformational gralranarians?alk about movement as if a dislocated element goes into the~pposite direction.2.2 ExplanationNow let us resume solving the problem.
The distribution ofgrammaticality over (1) through (5) is accounted for by as-suming the h)llowing constraints on the syntactic structure ofEnglish.
(6) Passing of a dislocated element is permitted only betweenthe mother and the head daughter or between the motherand the complement daughter.
'(7) Passing of a dislocated element and binding of anothercannot take place simultaneously in one local tree.In (1), every passing obeys this constraint.
For instance,passing the dislocated element bound by 'Who/' into $1 andpassing it into S, are both O.K., because S~ is the cmnplementof 'know' and S~ is the complement of 'that' (whether you mightemploy a transformational ccount or such theories as GPSG,HPSG, and LFG.
).However, (2) violates (6) and (7) First, the dislocated ele-ment bound by 'What/' is passed into $2, which is not a com-plement but an adjunct of 'girl'; i.e., a violation of (6) Second,the same dislocated element is passed into VP2 where anotherdislocated element gets bound by 'who', ending up with a vi-olation of (7).
Similarly in (3) and (4), passing and bindingco-occur at the local trees introducing 'who' and 'whatj', re-spectively, violating (7).
(5) is blocked by (7), because of thepassinginto the subject'a story about es'; i.e., the specifier ofINFL (in the transformational ccount) or of VP (in theorieslike GPSG, etc.
).2.3 Cognitive Aspects of ConstraintsThe explanations about such phenomena proposed in contem-porary linguistic inquiries, especialiy the accounts in terms ofbarriers /Chomsky 1986/, are roughly regarded as formaliza-tions of the idea sketched above.
This line of reasoning is in turnattributed to processing terms, when viewed from the stand-point of cognitive science.
The background intuition is that232the extent of processing load imposed by a syntactic operationvaries from one type of operation to another, and that thereis an upperbound on the total processing load for constitutingone branching local tree.
On account of this, the reason whypassing tend to be blocked under the certain sorts of circumstances would be that it is an expensive operation a11d thus ishard to perform together with other expensive operations uchas adjunction or binding..The processing load for carrying out various syntactic op-erations could be further reduced to more fundamental spectsof information processing.
Consider, for instance, why specifi-cation and adjnnction should be harder than cornplementat~on.q'he reason seems to be that complementation is lexical\]y litensed and is head-initial (the current discussion is limited toEnglish); i.e., the occurrence of a complement licensed by thelexical entry of its head and thus is predicted from the occur-rence of the preceding head.
On the other hand, the occurrenceof a specifier or of an adjunct is harder to predict, because theformer (though lexically licensed) precedes its head and thelatter is not lexically licensed by the head.
Passing and bind-ing of dislocated elements are also considered to be non-lexicaloperations, though there are a few exceptions involving, for ex-ample, so-called tough adjectives, as indicated by the followingsentence.
(8) \[Which violin\]/is \[this sonata\]j \[Apeasy to play ej on q\]?The difference between (4) and (8) is that the binding of thedislocated element carrying index j is lexically licensed in thelatter but not in the former.
In (8), the binding in effect occursat the local tree expanding AP, where this binding is sanctionedby the \]exical entry of 'easy'.
This is why (8) is grammatical despite (7); i.e., the lexically licensed binding is not an expensiveoperation, so that it does not play the same role as ordinarybinding would play in regard of (7).Note that the processing load concerning the examples wehave discussed so far is defined within a single sentence struc-ture rather than by taking structural ambiguity into account.This is why the traditional syntactic approaches are able to cap-ture some of such aspects of language; in principle, propertiesof a single structure can be characterized in static terms.3 Dynamic AccountHowever, the above static approach cannot by itself explainsome UBD phenomena, especially so-called the Complex NPConstraint (originally termed by Ross /Ross 1967/) observedin the examples that follow.
(9) *Whoi do you believe \[NPl\[mp2the claim\] \[gsthat \[sssheloves q\]\]\]?
(10) *What/ did you propose a plan \[vP to buy el\]?In (9), Sa is the complement of 'claim'.
Hence the dislocatedelement, bound by 'Who/' should be permitted to be passed intoSa without violating (6).
Similarly, VP (or CP, in the traus-formational account) in (10) is regarded as the eomplelnent of'plan', so that the dislocated element bound by 'What/' shouldbe able to pass through, (6) aud (7) being respected.
Hencethe static account in the previous section provides no reasonwhy these examples hould be ungrammatical.
It is consideredbecause of essentially the same sort of difficulty that Chomsky/Chomsky 1986/ leaves unexplained this type of island effect.3ol A Model of Language ProcessingNow then let us turn to dymunic aspects of language processing,and consider what kind of syntactic structures a human bearershould have tmilt and tentatiwdy maintains when 'that'  in (9)is encountered.
As a basis for this investigatiou, we adopt thefollowing postulates about ha,nan language processing.
(\[1) t*.
When ;~ word is encountered, it is attached to stcuc..tures previously built, giving rise to new structures.ii;ven when several possible wa?~ of attachment areacknowledged, the processing is sot postponed, buta~ many new structures corresponding to those wayso:{!
attachment are made in parallel.b.
'lJ'here is a limitation on the size of the memory for.~toring these structures, and thus it is impossible toretain all the structures potentially sanctioned.
Onlystrtn;tures activated strongly enough can survive thecompetition lbr seats in the limited memory.From ( l l )  plus some minor hypotheses, a general processingmodel %11o'?% which describes both sentence comprehensionand generation.
This model postulates that.
just after any worda is encounLered, every maximal structure of the sentence cur,rently hypothesized in mind should look at)t)roximately like thepart enclosed within the curve in (:12).
(12)j ;2itere ew;ry branching local tree is assumed to be binary,without los~ of generality.
AI and ,5' may be identical, andthe short-term emory contains the information about Ai, Bi(1 _< i < d), and A, pins the inEormatin about the configura..lion of these categories relative to each other.
Note that, as awhole, enough information is thus retained to control the gram-.maticality ot the way the foregoing context fits the rest of thesentmme; Those categories are the points on which the currentlyhypothesized structure has contacts with the still unknown partof the sente0ce.Strictly speaking~ the picture shown in (12) should he lookedupon merely as a first order approximation of the reality.
Thatia, the part of the sentence structnre enclosed in tlte curvemight contain some variable parts, rather than being totallydefinite.
Suppose, \[o;r instance, that a sentence begins wit, h a*~oun phrase say "this man'.
Tit(; entire tree structure of thisNP should he completed as sool~ as 'm~,on' is encountered, butits grammatical case would not be uniquely determined yet, he-cause the senteuce as a whole might turn out to be soinethinglike "l'his n-tP, n, I don't know', rather than "Fhis man is crazy';The initiM NPis accusative in the former sentence, and nonfina-tive in the latter.
In the following discussion, however, we shallmerely exploit very rough properties of the model, so that suchan inaccuracy is considered irrelevant.
Readers are referred tol lasida/ l iasida 1985/for how this model is ohtained and whatit predicts, wtfich the limited space of the current article failsto accommodate.3?2 Exp larmt ion1,et us tm'n t>ack to (9).
According to this model, when %hat' isencountered while (9) is being comprehended, the right-branchingstructnre covering the string from 'Whoi' through 'claim' hasbeen nearly completed ;rod the most active structure around'that'  should look like (13).
Ilere arise two pieces of indepen-(13) NP1NP2 $3the claim (,Oral1thatdent two way ambiguity, as listed below, concerning how thisstructure might potentially grow.
(14) a.
"i 'hat' is a relative t}ronoun.h.
'That'  is a conjunction.
(115) a. Ss contains a gap bound by 'What/'.h.
~a does not contain a gap bound by 'What/'.The combination of (14a,b) and (\]5a,b) gives rise to local struc-i,m'al ambiguity across four hypotheses: (l 4a~ \[5a), (14 a&l 5b),(Hb&lSa), a,~d ({4b~lSb).Since (:16),a~instantiation of (14a&15b),is clearly O.K.,what we have to show is that out of these ff~nr hypotheses just(lda&15b) and (14b&15b) enter t\],e grammar to be ~tcquired.
(I6) Whoi did you tell ci the I'awt .hat dhe kH('.w q~?ltence now let us consider why (I d a&l 5a) a~arl (14 b&lSa)are rejected, We pay attention to the beh~tvior of dislocatedelements, as we did in the stath: approach, q'wo dislocateddements ar0 relevant o the grammatical status of (9).
Thefirst one, which is bound by q;hat', corresponds to the possibility(14a).
Let us refer to this as a from now on.
The other, the onebound by 'Whati', is present iff (15a) obtains.
We shall calI itThe status of (14a&15a) is parallel to (1).
(7) rules out thispossibility immediately, because it postulates that the local treeexpanding S-a accommodates both the binding of cv by 'that'  andthe passing of fl into Sa.
As for (14b&15a), however, (7) as itis fails to work.We need some preparation before tackling why (14b&lSa)is rejected.
(7) says that two distinct dislocated elements, onepassed and the other bound, cannot simultaneously take partin one local tree.
As mentioned above, the cognitive-scientificmotivation for the constraints (6) and (7) is that the mentalgranmtar does not admit a rule whose execution accompaniestoo severe processing load.
On account of this motivation, (7)is natnrally generalized simply by taking off the presuppositionthat only an operation in one local tree is talked about.
That233is, we hold:(17) The grammar cannot accommodate any rule which ma-nipulates two distinct dislocated elements in two differentmanners, binding the one and passing the other, at thesame time (irrespective of whether or not the two dislo-cated elements are processed in the same local tree of thesame coherent structure of a sentence).The essential difference between (7) and (17) is that the lattercan mention a rule which simultaneously handles several hy-pothetical structures of the same sentence; i.e., a rule whichexplicitly deals with a local structural ambiguity.
That is, (17)does, but (7) does not, reject such a rule if it binds a dislo-cated element in a sentence structure and at the same timepasses another dislocated element in another structure, the twostructures corresponding to two different hypotheses.Now let us return to (14b~;15a).
(14a&15a) having beenruled out, we are now left with three possibilities: (14a&lhb),(14b&15a) and (14b&lhb).
The former two give rise to a and/5, respectively, and hence these dislocated ements how upin the multiple structure representing the disjunction of thesepossibilities; i.e., the structure subsuming in parallel the threestructnres instantiating those possibilities.
According to themodel introduced above, these two dislocated elements are si-multaneously manipulated, one bound and the other passed.That is, tile local tree expanding Sa (i.e., the local tree in whichthe binding of c~ and passing of fl are both supposed to takeplace) is built at the same time in all the three possible linesof processing.
\]'his is understood by comparing (13) with .thenext state (18).
When you go from (13) to (18), the local treeexpanding Sa is completed.
(18) NP1the claim Comp Ss //t/\] that /DetItheAccording to (17), therefore, the rule of syntax in charge ofthis case must reject the possibility of the existence of eitheror fl; otherwise these two dislocated elements would be ma-nipulated (bound and passed) simultaneously here.
Now notethat a is chronologically newer than ft. What psychologistscall the recency effect, consequently, tells us that a (hence(14a&15b)) should sm'vive, defeating fl and thus rendering (9)ungrammatical.The account of the ungrammaticality of (10) is the sameexcept that the potential binder, which is the counterpart of'that' in (9), is hidden in 'plan' and thus is not overt here.
Thistime a is the dislocated element bound by this binder, andthe one bound by 'Whati'.Note that this explanation concerns language acquisition bychildren, rather than language use by adults.
It must concernthe acquisition stage; otherwise what we have shown would notbe the ungrammaticality of (9) and (10) but merely the diffi-234culty of processing them.
In fact, the above account does applyto language acquisition, because the ambiguity pertaining to(14) and (15) occm's every time a structure like (13) is encoun-tered, so that its disambiguation can be fixated as a part of thegrammar of English to be acquired.3 .3  Ru les  Hand l ing  Loca l  Ambigu i tyFurther discussion are in order here about the generalized con-straint (17) and its role in the above explanation.
First, theabove discussion postulates that the grammar ules are sensi-tive to structural ambiguity such as (14) and (\].5) about (9),in the sense that some rules of syntax work on multiple struc-tures, and thus are in charge of disambiguation.
Here one mightworry which types of ambiguity are handled by the grammar,and which are handled metagrammatically.
Not every sort: ofambiguity is visible to the grammar, as is demonstrated by thefollowing example, which is grammatical.
(19) Whoi did you tell the man \[~4that Is, she loves ?/\]\]?The local ambiguity arising here appears irrfilar to that of(9).
More precisely, a four-way local ambiguity arises at ~that',as a combination of two pieces of independent two-way ambi-guity, one concerning whether 'that' is a relative pronoun or aconjunction, and the other whether or not $4 contains a gapbound by 'Who/', just as in (9).
: An outstanding difference be-tween (9) and (19), however, is that the ambiguity in the lattercase involves two different hypothetical constituent structuresthat follow.
(20) \[vp\[vltell \[Nplthe man\]\] [g that Ss\]\](21) \[Gtell \[NP2\[Nplthe man\] \[g that Ss\]\]\]To children learning UBD constructions, both of these con-stituent structures hould appear ambiguous about whether ornot S~ contains a gap bound by 'Whoi'.This ambiguity, unlike the one in (9), is considered invisibleto the grammar, presumably because of the above ditference.That is, if any single rule were sensitive to this ambiguity, (19)should be rendered ungrammatical for the same reason why (9)is so, because in (19) a dislocated element would be bound by'that' and another dislocated element would be passed into $4simultaneously.
To make sure that the binding and the pass-ing should be simultaneous here, notice that the local tree ex-panding S~ is completed simultaneously in the two pairs of hy-potheses corresponding respectively to (20) and (21).
Itencethe binding by 'that' and the passing into Ss must take placesimultaneously.Seemingly the reason why the grammar is not sensitive tothis type of local ambiguity is that the four possibilities are notcoherent enough, in the sense that they are distributed acrossthe two distinct constituent structures as mentioned above.
Itappears that the disambiguation f a local structural ambiguityis acquired as a part of the grammar only if the structures (orhypotheses) constituting that ambiguity are coherent enoughwith each other.
Comparing (19) with (9) and (10), one mightthus posit the following constraint.
(22) A local structural ambiguity is handled within the gram-mar only if the parallel structures involved therein sharethe same constituent structure.As for (9), for instance, besides (13) there could of coursebe several other structural possibilities, but they are simply it-.relevant o the acquMtion process discussed above, rather than:~ystemat, ica.lly abandoned like (14a&15a) and (14b&15a).
Wewould then be able to disregard any interaction across distinctconstituent structures when considering the competence gram-mar.There are ~,|; least two more supports to constraint (22).l"irst, (22) f)llows from the following more fundamentM con-straint.
(23) There is a severe limit, ou the size of the structure whichone rule of syntax can refer to at once.An arnbigui'i;y within one constituent structure tends to fullwithin this limit, because the parallel structures involw'.d thereinshare most i;f the storage with each other.
An ambiguity acrossseveral con:~(.ituenl, structures, howc'ver, wouht more often runout of this limit, since, the rate of the shared memory is smldler.Note that (2a) claims, after all, nothing more than the lira\]ta-t.ion on the complexity of mentally feasible rules.Another reason h)r holding (22) is based on how ~stuhborn'an ambiguity is.
As menl;ioned earlier, patterns like (9) and(10) constantly ;~ccompany the local ambiguity like (14) plus(15).
In contrast, patterns like (19) are often less ambiguous,as shown in tile example below.
(24) Whoi did you tell him \[g that she loves ell?In this s.mtence, the possibilit;y of ' that'  being a relatiw~pronoun i,s very unplausible, the local ambiguity being greatlyw.duced; we are left with the aml)iguity of whether or not tit(;dislocai, ed element bound by 'Whoi' is coutaiiled in $6.
Ill summary, the ambiguity in (9) and (\]0) is robust, while that in (19)is fragile.
An ambiguity within a single constituent structuretends I;o be robust, tn comparison, an ambiguity encompass.-ing several different constituent structnres tends to be fragile,because the relationship (as for which is more plausible thanwhich, etc.)
between those eonstituent structures varies fromcase to case, depending on tim internal details of the relevanl;constituents context, and so on.
The corresponding relation inlhe former tgpc of aml)iguity, oil the ol, her hand, is more con-stant.
Robu:;t ambiguity is visible to the grammar, while fragileone is not; Some rules of syntax handle tile former, while thelatter is trea{,ed metagrammatically.304 Cerman Case'\]~he following pair of German examples might fall out of ourdynamic account on (9) and (10).
(25) Weni glauben Sic, dab er ei liebl;?
(26) *Wen/glauben Sie die Behauptung, duff er ei liebt?
(25) and (2fi) are (.lerman counterparts of (1) and (9), respec-tively.
Note that the direct translation between English andCerman pre::erves grammaticality across these pairs of examples.Since '\]~ehauptung' ix of the feminine geuder rather thanneuter, ~daff should not be confused with a relative pronoun,namely 'die' or ~der', whose antecedent is 'Behanptuug'; Therelative proi)oun pronounced the same as 'daft' is 'das', whichis of I;he neul, er gender and the nominative or accusative case.So it appears that in the case of (26) children learning Germanshould face no ambiguity like ( 14 ).
O u r current ap p roach, whichis essentially based on local ambiguity, hence seems unable {,oaccount for the grammatical status of (26).In reality, however, the above example does not contradicl;our approach; i.e., constraint (17).
Ambiguity parallel to (14)arises in fact, and t, herelbre the ungranimaticality of (26) ispredicted by (17).
To children learning 1.JBI) construction ofGerman, (26) accompanies the same sort of local ambiguity as(9) does, because they acquire the rough fl'amework of UBDconstruc(.iou before the gender system is properly installed intotile morphology of relative pronouns.
According to Mills /Mills\]986/, when children begin to use rela.tive clauses around theage of 3, relative pronouns in the relative constructions theymake a.w either simply ommited or le~cking iuforulatiou aboutthe geunler (and the case, too).
\])'or eXaml)le:(27) Das \]st {flu l)iiz *ram in Wahle.

'This means that at; the beg\]truing chikh'en canaot distinguisha relative pronoun of a gender fl'onx ~mothcr relat,ive pronoun of a different gender; e.g, between 'die' and '(lair.
Millsreports that the use of relative pronouns is equlppe.d with theproper system of inflection only a.ftcr the age of '1 is reached.The significance of (25) and (26) is not crystal clear, iuci-dentally~ if the uonsentence below is also taken into account.
(28) *Wen gla.uben Sic, daft er schen wollte?Who think you that he see-IN\]" want-.PAST'Who do you think that he wanted to see?
'Thus it might be that the ui~gra)runaticality of (26) is a, ttribntedto that of (28), without regard to (17).
Otherwise the abovepair of examples (25) and (26) should provide a. furl.her evidencesupporting (1.7).4 f~inal R ,emarksWe have accounted for some island condi(ions by me~nsof computational evahtation of relevant syntactic operatk)ns;i.e., the e.valul,tion reflected in constraints uch ~s (6), (7),etc.
These constraints are regarded its captured by the e.x.\]sting linguistic theories.
A generalized const.laint (\] 7) applica.ble to dynamic aspects of la.nguage processing, especiaJ\]y localstructural ambiguity, has been demonstrated to account for thenoun-complement case of the Complex NP Constrain(., whichseems hard te elucidate in static terms of traditional apt)roachesto syntax.One important aspect of our approach enlpJoyed here is thehypothesis tha.t some sorl, of local ambiguity is visible to andthus handled by the grammar, lI' this hypothesis finally turusout true, which we have attempted to demoastrat(.
', I.he statical)proach pursued so far in the linguistic inquiries must be reconsidered.
'.l'hat is, an explanation on tim grammal, icality ofsentences will have to sometimes take into account sere3 al possible structures in parallel.The explanation of the same sort of island loud\]lion by Marcus/Marcus 1980/is comparable I,o ours in that it also exploitslocal ambiguity, postulating rules handling them.
Since Marcuspays no attention to what kind of ambiguity is visible and whatkind is not, howcver, his discussion has n<>thing to sa~y about235the contrast between (9) and (19).
Besides, a radical differencebetween the two approaches i that Marcus exploits a stipula-tion called the determinism hypothesis, whereas we ernploya more humble working hypothesis of parallel processing plusmemory limitation.A caution would be worthy of noting here.
A success ofcomputational explanation does not necessarily support eitherinnatis m (~ la N. Chomsky, J.
A. Fodor, D. Marr, etc.)
oreonstruetivism (~la J. Piaget, etc.).
If any part of hmnan in-teliigence could be understood to be the outcome of a simpleoptimization for some computation, it should subject o twodifferent interpretations: that this part should be a domain-specific innate endowment because such a simple optimizationmay well be preprogrammed in the course of evolution, or, con-trariwise, that it should be generated after birth by the workof the domain-independent general intelligence because such asimple optimization could be carried out through maturationand internal experiences.
Further scrutiny would thus be sim-ply needed in order to steer our way either to innatist or con-structionist dispositior/.Along the line of the present argument, perhaps the firstpoint where we could face the choice between these two doc-trines is the problem of how much processing load we shouldascribe to various yntactic operations.
The evaluation of com-putational load as we have exploited here should vary acrosslanguages, depending on the relative statuses of syntactic op-erations.
For instance, the situation must be drasticMly dif-ferent between dominantly head-initial languages like Englishand Spanish and head-final languages such as Japanes e and Ko-rean (and maybe German, too).
Also open to further scrutinyis whether the variation is explained by the parameter settingapproach of transformational theories, or by more general com-putational considerations.References/Bresnan 1982/ Bresnan, J.: (ed.)
