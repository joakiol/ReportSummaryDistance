PittsburghPittsburgh, PA 15260tetreaul@pitt.eduAbstractWe use ?2 to investigate the context de-pendency of student affect in our com-puter tutoring dialogues, targeting uncer-tainty in student answers in 3 automati-cally monitorable contexts.
Our resultsshow significant dependencies betweenuncertain answers and specific contexts.Identification and analysis of these depen-dencies is our first step in developing anadaptive version of our dialogue system.1 IntroductionDetecting and adapting to user affect is being ex-plored by many researchers to improve dialogue sys-tem quality.
Detection has received much atten-tion (e.g., (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004; Lee andNarayanan, 2005)), but less work has been done onadaptation, due to the difficulty of developing re-sponses and applying them at the right time.
Mostwork on adaptation takes a context-independent ap-proach: use the same type of response after all in-stances of an affective state.
For example, Liu andPicard (2005)?s health assessment system respondswith empathy to all instances of user stress.Research suggests, however, that it may be moreeffective to take a context-dependent approach: de-velop multiple responses for each affective state,whose use depends on the state?s context.
E.g., in thetutoring domain, Pon-Barry et al (2006) show thathuman tutors use multiple responses to uncertainstudent answers, depending on the answer?s correct-ness and prior context.
In the information-seekingdomain, it is commonly believed that while an apol-ogy is a good default response to user frustration (asin (Klein et al, 2002)), one context requires a differ-ent response: after several frustrated user turns, thecall should be forwarded to a human operator.A context-dependent approach to affect adapta-tion must address 2 issues: in what contexts to adapt,and what responses to use there.
This paper ad-dresses the first issue and targets student uncertaintyin our computer tutoring dialogues.
Although our di-alogues have a Question-Answer format, our systemcontains 275 tutor questions.
Treating each questionas a context is too labor-intensive for adaptation de-velopment and creates a data sparsity issue.
Insteadwe treat automatically monitorable question proper-ties as contexts.
Here we examine 3 contexts: the di-alogue act interpretation, and the discourse structuredepth and transition, of the prior tutor question.
Weuse ?2 to investigate the context dependency of un-certain student answers (correct and incorrect).
Ourresults show that some contexts are significantly as-sociated with uncertain answers.
Our next step willbe to use these significant dependencies to developsystem responses to uncertain answers in these con-texts.
These responses will be based both on ourhypotheses about why uncertainty is associated withthese contexts, and on analyses of human tutor re-sponses to uncertain answers in these contexts.2 Student Uncertainty and Prior ContextITSPOKE is a speech-enabled version of a text-based tutoring system (VanLehn et al, 2002).
Thestudent first types an essay answering one of 5 qual-itative physics problems.
ITSPOKE parses the es-say, extracts dialogue topics concerning misconcep-tions, then engages the student in dialogue.
In thisstudy we used 2 ITSPOKE corpora containing 4590student turns over 185 dialogues from 37 students.Figure 1 shows an annotated dialogue excerpt.41ITSPOKE4: Good.
Does the packet have an acceleration?
If yes please specify its direction.
[SAQ, Advance, D1]STUDENT4: horizontally forward yes [non-uncertain, incorrect]ITSPOKE5: Well... To find the packet?s acceleration we will use Newton?s 2nd law.
What is the definition of this law?
[LAQ,Push, D2]STUDENT5: an object in motion tends to stay in motion until it?s act by an outside force [uncertain, incorrect]ITSPOKE6: Well... Newton?s 2nd law says that the net force acting on an object equals the mass times the acceleration of theobject.
We can define Newton?s 2nd law as F=m*a.
Hence what can we determine about the acceleration of the packet giventhat we know the net force acting on it is not zero and points straight down?
[DAQ, Advance, D2]STUDENT6: I don?t know [uncertain, incorrect]ITSPOKE7: Well... < further discussion of Newton?s 2nd law...> So once again on the original question.
Does the packet have anacceleration?
If yes please specify its direction.
[SAQ, PopUp, D1]Figure 1: ITSPOKE Annotated Dialogue Excerpt2.1 Uncertainty and Correctness AnnotationsITSPOKE, like most computer tutors, responds onlyto student correctness.
ITSPOKE labels each an-swer as correct or incorrect1 .
If correct, ITSPOKEmoves on to the next question.
If incorrect, then forquestions on simple topics, ITSPOKE gives the cor-rect answer and moves on, while for questions oncomplex topics (ITSPOKE4, Figure 1), ITSPOKEinitiates a sub-dialogue with remediation questions(ITSPOKE5 - ITSPOKE6), before moving on.Recent computer tutoring research has shown in-terest in responding to student affect2 over cor-rectness.
Uncertainty is of particular interest: re-searchers hypothesize that uncertainty and incorrect-ness each create an opportunity to learn (VanLehnet al, 2003).
They cannot be equated, however.First, an uncertain answer may be correct or incor-rect (Pon-Barry et al, 2006).
Second, uncertainty in-dicates that the student perceives a possible miscon-ception in their knowledge.
Thus, system responsesto uncertain answers can address both the correct-ness and the perceived misconception.In our ITSPOKE corpora, each student answerhas been manually annotated as uncertain or non-uncertain3 : uncertain is used to label answers ex-pressing uncertainty or confusion about the material;non-uncertain is used to label all other answers.1We have also manually labeled correctness in our data;agreement between ITSPOKE and human is 0.79 Kappa (90%).2We use ?affect?
to cover emotions and attitudes that affecthow students communicate.
Although some argue ?emotion?and ?attitude?
should be distinguished, some speech researchersfind the narrow sense of ?emotion?
too restrictive because it ex-cludes states where emotion is present but not full-blown, in-cluding arousal and attitude (Cowie and Cornelius, 2003).3A second annotator relabeled our dataset, yielding inter-annotator agreement of 0.73 Kappa (92%).2.2 Context AnnotationsHere we examine 3 automatically monitorable tutorquestion properties as our contexts for uncertainty:Tutor Question Acts: In prior work one annotatorlabeled 4 Tutor Question Acts in one ITSPOKE cor-pus (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2006)4: Short (SAQ),Long (LAQ), and Deep Answer Question (DAQ) dis-tinguish the question in terms of content and the typeof answer it requires.
Repeat (RPT) labels variantsof ?Can you repeat that??
after rejections.
Fromthese annotations we built a hash table associatingeach ITSPOKE question with a Question Act label;with this table we automatically labeled ITSPOKEquestions in our second ITSPOKE corpus.Discourse Structure Depth/Transition: In priorwork we showed that the discourse structure Depthand Transition for each ITSPOKE turn can be au-tomatically annotated (Rotaru and Litman, 2006).E.g., as shown in Figure 1, ITSPOKE4,7 have depth1 and ITSPOKE5,6 have depth 2.
We combine lev-els 3 and above (3+) due to data sparsity.
6 Transi-tion labels represent the turn?s position relative to theprior ITSPOKE turn: NewTopLevel labels the firstquestion after an essay.
Advance labels questions atthe same depth as the prior question (ITSPOKE4,6).Push labels the first question in a sub-dialogue(after an incorrect answer) (ITSPOKE5).
After asub-dialogue, ITSPOKE asks the original questionagain, labeled PopUp (ITSPOKE7), or moves on tothe next question, labeled PopUpAdv.
SameGoal la-bels both ITSPOKE RPTS (after rejections) and re-peated questions after timeouts.4Our Acts are based on related work (Graesser et al, 1995).Two annotators labeled the Acts in 8 dialogues in a parallel hu-man tutoring corpus, with agreement of 0.75 Kappa (90%).423 Uncertainty Context DependenciesWe use the ?2 test to investigate the context depen-dency of uncertain (unc) or non-uncertain (nonunc)student answers that are correct (C) or incorrect (I).First, we compute an overall ?2 value between eachcontext variable and the student answer variable.
Forexample, the Question Act variable (QACT) has 4values: SAQ, LAQ, DAQ, RPT.
The answer vari-able (SANSWER) also has 4 values: uncC, uncI,nonuncC, nonuncI.
Table 1 (last column) shows the?2 value between these variables is 203.38, whichgreatly exceeds the critical value of 16.92 (p?
0.05,df=9), indicating a highly significant dependency.Significance increases as the ?2 value increases.Dependency Obs.

To do this, we createa binary variable from each value of the context andanswer variables.
E.g., the binary variable for LAQhas 2 values: ?LAQ?
and ?Anything Else?, and thebinary variable for uncC has 2 values: ?uncC?
and?Anything Else?.
We then compute the ?2 value be-tween the binary variables.
Table 1 shows this valueis 133.98, which greatly exceeds the critical value of3.84 (p?
0.05, df=1).
The table also shows the ob-served (72) and expected (22) counts.
Comparisondetermines the sign of the dependency: uncC occurssignificantly more than expected (+) after LAQ.
The?=?
sign indicates a non-significant dependency.Table 1 shows uncertain answers (uncC and uncI)occur significantly more than expected after LAQs.In contrast, non-uncertain answers occur signifi-cantly less (-), or aren?t significantly dependent (=).Also, uncI occurs significantly more than expectedafter DAQs.
We hypothesize that LAQs and DAQsare associated with more uncertainty because theyare harder questions requiring definitions or deepreasoning.
Not surprisingly, uncertain (and incor-rect) answers occur significantly less than expectedafter SAQs (easier fill-in-the-blank questions).
Un-certainty shows very weak dependencies on RPTs.Table 2 shows that Depth1 is associated with morecorrectness and less uncertainty overall.
Both typesof correct answer occur significantly more than ex-pected, but this dependency is stronger for nonuncC.Both incorrect answers occur significantly less thanexpected, but this dependency is stronger for uncI.Dependency Obs.

Incorrect answers occur significantly morethan expected, and the dependencies are stronger foruncI.
We hypothesize that deeper depths are asso-ciated with increased uncertainty and incorrectnessbecause they correspond to deeper knowledge gaps;uncertainty here may also relate to a perceived lackof cohesion between sub-topic and larger solution.Table 3 shows Pushes have the same dependen-cies as deeper depths (increased uncertainty and in-correctness); however, here the uncI dependency isonly slightly stronger than nonuncI, which suggeststhat increased uncertainty at deeper depths is morereliably associated with remediation questions afterthe Push.
Although uncertainty shows only weak43dependencies on PopUps, after PopUpAdvs the uncIdependency is strong, with uncI occurring more thanexpected.
We hypothesize that this dependency re-lates to students losing track of the original ques-tion/larger topic.
Uncertainty shows only weak de-pendencies on Advances.
After NewTopLevels, in-correct answers occur less than expected, but the de-pendency is stronger for nonuncI.
After SameGoals,incorrect answers occur more than expected, but thedependency is stronger for nonuncI.
Compared withthe RPT results, the SameGoal results suggest stu-dents feel increased uncertainty after timeouts.Dependency Obs.

We plan to examine more contexts, such asa Topic Repetition variable that tracks similar ques-tions about a topic (e.g.
gravity) across dialogues.Our next step will be to use the significant de-pendencies to develop system responses to uncer-tain answers in these contexts.
These responses willbe based both on our hypotheses about why uncer-tainty is significantly associated with these contexts,as well as on analyses of human tutor responsesin these contexts, using our human tutoring corpus,which was collected with our first ITSPOKE corpususing the same experimental procedure.We also plan to investigate context dependenciesfor other affective states, such as student frustration.AcknowledgmentsNSF (#0631930, #0354420 and #0328431) andONR (N00014-04-1-0108) support this research.ReferencesR.
