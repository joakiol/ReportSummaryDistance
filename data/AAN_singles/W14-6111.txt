The goal of the shared task is to allow to train and test different partic-ipating systems on comparable data sets, thus providing an objective measure of comparison betweenstate-of-the-art parsing systems on data data sets from a range of different languages.
This 2014 SPMRLshared task is a continuation and extension of the SPMRL shared task, which was co-located with theSPMRL meeting at EMNLP 2013 (Seddah et al., 2013).This paper provides a short overview of the 2014 SPMRL shared task goals, data sets, and evaluationsetup.
Since the SPMRL 2014 largely builds on the infrastructure established for the SPMRL 2013shared task, we start by reviewing the previous shared task (?2) and then proceed to the 2014 SPMRLevaluation settings (?3), data sets (?4), and a task summary (?5).
Due to organizational constraints,this overview is published prior to the submission of all system test runs, and a more detailed overviewincluding the description of participating systems and the analysis of their results will follow as part of(Seddah et al., 2014), once the shared task is completed.2 The SPMRL Shared Task 2013The SPMRL Shared Task 2013 (Seddah et al., 2013) was organized with the goal of providing standarddata sets, streamlined evaluation metrics, and a set of strong baselines for parsing morphologically richlanguages (MRLs).
The goals were both to provide a focal point for researchers interested in parsingMRLs and consequently to advance the state of the art in this area of research.The shared task focused on parsing nine morphologically rich languages, from different typologicallanguage families, in both a constituent-based and a dependency-based format.
The set of nine typolog-ically diverse languages comprised data sets for Arabic, Basque, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian,Korean, Polish, and Swedish.
Compared to previous multilingual shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi,2006; Nivre et al., 2007), the SPMRL shared task targeted parsing in realistic evaluation scenarios, inwhich the analysis of morphologically ambiguous input tokens is not known in advance.
An additionalnovelty of the SPMRL shared task is that it allowed for both a dependency-based and a constituent-based parse representation.
This setting relied on an intricate and careful data preparation process whichensured consistency between the constituent and the dependency version by aligning the two representa-tion types at the token level and at the level of part-of-speech tags.
For all languages, we provided twoversions of the data sets: an all data set, identical in size to the one made available by the individualtreebank providers, and a small data set, with a training set of 5,000 sentences, and a test set of about 500sentences.
Controlling the set sizes across languages allows us to level the playing field across languagesand treebanks.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In general, parsing is reduced to the parsing proper step, assuming gold segmentation of thetext into sentences and words as well as gold POS tags and morphological analyses.
This is a serioussimplification of the task since especially in Semitic languages, the segmentation into input tokens is atask that is best performed in combination with parsing because of the ambiguities involved.The shared task deviated from this standard configuration by adding conditions in which more realisticsettings were given: In the gold setting, unambiguous gold morphological segmentation, POS tags, andmorphological features for each input token were given.
In the predicted setting, disambiguated morpho-logical segmentation was provided, but the POS tags and morphological features for each input segmentwere not.
In the raw setting, there was no gold information, i.e., morphological segmentation, POS tagsand morphological features for each input token had to be predicted as part of the parsing task.
To lowerthe entry cost, participants were provided with reasonable baseline (if not state-of-the-art) morphologicalpredictions (either disambiguated ?
in most cases?
or ambiguous prediction in lattice forms).As a consequence of the raw scenario, it was not possible to (only) rely on the accepted parsing met-rics, labeled bracket evaluation via EVALB1 (Black et al., 1991), Leaf-Ancestor (Sampson and Babarczy,2003) for constituents and CONLL X?s Labeled/Unlabeled Attachment Score for dependencies (Buch-holz and Marsi, 2006).
When the segmentation of words into input tokens is not given, there may bediscrepancies on the lexical levels, which neither EVALB and LEAF-ANCESTOR nor LAS/UAS are pre-pared to handle.
Thus, we also used TedEval, a distance-based metric that evaluates a morphosyntacticstructure as a complete whole (Tsarfaty et al., 2012b).
Note that given the workload brought to the par-ticipants, we did not try to enforce function label evaluation for constituent parsing.
We hope that furthershared tasks will try to generalize such an evaluation.
Indeed, having predicted function labels wouldease labeled TEDEVAL evaluation and favor a full parsing chain evaluation.
Nevertheless, the choice ofTEDEVAL allowed us to go beyond the standard cross-parser evaluation within one setting and approachcross-framework (constituent vs. dependency (Tsarfaty et al., 2012a)) and cross-language evaluation,thus pushing the envelope on parsing evaluation.
Additionally, we performed a specialized evaluation ofmulti-word expressions in the French treebank.The SPMRL Shared Task 2013 featured seven teams who approached the dependency parsing taskand one team that approached constituent parsing.
The best performing system (Bjo?rkelund et al., 2013)in either framework consisted of an ensemble system, combining several dependency parsers or sev-eral instantiations of a PCFG-LA parser by a (re-)ranker, both on top of state-of-the-art morphologicalanalyses.
The results show that parser combination helps to reach a robust performance across lan-guages.
However, the integration of morphological analysis into the parsing needs to be investigatedthoroughly, and new, morphologically aware approaches are needed.
The cross-parser, cross-scenario,and cross-framework evaluation protocols show that performance on gold morphological input is signif-icantly higher than that in more realistic scenarios, and more training data is beneficial.
Additionally,differences between dependency and constituents are smaller than previously assumed, and languageswhich are typologically farthest from English, such as Semitic and Asian languages, are still amongstthe hardest to parse, regardless of the parsing method used.3 SPMRL 2014 Parsing ScenariosAs in the previous edition, this year, we consider three parsing scenarios, depending on how much of themorphological information is provided.
The scenarios are listed below, in increasing order of difficulty.?
Gold: In this scenario, the parser is provided with unambiguous gold morphological segmentation,POS tags, and morphological features for each input token.?
Predicted: In this scenario, the parser is provided with disambiguated morphological segmentation.However, the POS tags and morphological features for each input segment are unknown.?
Raw: In this scenario, the parser is provided with morphologically ambiguous input.
The morpho-logical segmentation, POS tags, and morphological features for each input token are unknown.1We extended the usualEVALB to penalize unparsed sentences.104Scenario Segmentation PoS+Feat.

?Table 1: A summary of the parsing and evaluation scenarios.
X depicts gold information, ?
depictsunknown information, to be predicted by the system.The Predicted and Raw scenarios require predicting morphological analyses.
This may be done usinga language-specific morphological analyzer, or it may be done jointly with parsing.
We provide inputsthat support these different scenarios:?
Predicted: Gold treebank segmentation is given to the parser.
The POS tags assignment and mor-phological features are automatically predicted by the parser or by an external resource.?
Raw (1-best): The 1-best segmentation and POS tags assignment is predicted by an external re-source and given to the parser.?
Raw (all): All possible segmentations and POS tags are specified by an external resource.
Theparser selects jointly a segmentation and a tree.An overview of all scenarios is shown in table 1.
For languages in which terminals equal tokens, onlyGold and Predicted scenarios are considered.
For the Semitic languages, we further provide input forboth Raw (1-best) and Raw (all) scenarios.24 SPMRL 2014 Data SetsThe main innovation of the SPMRL 2014 shared task with respect to the previous edition is the availabil-ity of additional, unannotated data, for the purpose of semi-supervised training.
This section providesa description of the unlabeled-data preparation that is required in the context of parsing MRLs, and thecore labeled data that is used in conjunction with it.4.1 SPMRL Unlabeled Data SetOne of the common problems when dealing with morphologically rich languages (MRLs) is lexical datasparseness due to the high level of variation in word forms (Tsarfaty et al., 2010; Tsarfaty et al., 2012c).The use of large, unlabeled corpora in a semi-supervised setting, in addition to the relatively small MRLdata sets, can become a valid option to overcome such issues.
For instance, using Brown clusters (Brownet al., 1992) has been shown to boost the performance of a PCFG-LA based parser for French (Canditoand Crabbe?, 2009; Candito and Seddah, 2010).
External lexical acquisition was successfully used forArabic (Habash, 2008) and Hebrew (Goldberg et al., 2009), self-training increased accuracy for parsingGerman (Rehbein, 2011), and more recently, the use of word embeddings led to some promising resultsfor some MRLs (Cirik and S?ensoy, 2013).By releasing large, unlabeled data sets and by providing accurate pre-annotation in a format directlycompatible with models trained on the SPMRL Shared Task treebanks, we hope to foster the developmentof interesting and feature-rich parsing models that build on larger, morphologically rich, lexicons.
Table2 presents basic facts about the data sets.
Details on the unlabeled data and their pre-annotations willbe provided in (Seddah et al., 2014).
Note that we could not ensure the same volume of data for alllanguages, nor we could run the same parser, or morphology prediction, on all data.
Potential future workcould focus on ensuring a stricter level of comparability of these data or on investigating the feasibilityof such a normalization of procedures.2The raw Arabic lattices were made available later than the other data.
They are now included in the shared task release.105Language Source (main) type size (tree tokens) morph parsedArabic news domain news 120M X* X*Basque web balanced 150M X XFrench news domain newswire 120M X+mwe X*German Wikipedia wiki (edited) 205M X XHebrew Wikipedia wiki (edited) 160M X XHungarian news domain newswire 100M X XKorean news domain newswire 40M X X*Polish Wikipedia wiki (edited) 100M X XSwedish PAROLE balanced 24M X XTable 2: Unlabeled data set properties.
*: made available mid-july4.2 SPMRL Core Labeled Data SetIn order to provide a faithful evaluation of the impact of these additional sets of unlabeled data, we usedthe exact same data sets for training and testing as in the previous edition.
Specifically, we used an Arabicdata set, originally provided by the LDC (Maamouri et al., 2004), in a dependency form, derived from theColumbia Catib Treebank (Habash and Roth, 2009; Habash et al., 2009) and in a constituency instance,following the Stanford pre-processing scheme (Green and Manning, 2010) and extended according to theSPMRL 2013 extension scheme (Seddah et al., 2013).
For Basque, the data was provided by Aduriz etal.
(2003) in both dependency and constituency, we removed sentences with non-projective trees so bothinstances could be aligned at the token level.
Regarding French, we used a new instance of the FrenchTreebank (Abeille?
et al., 2003) that includes multi-word expression (MWE) annotations, annotated at themorpho-syntactic level in both instances.
Predicted MWEs were added this year, using the same tools asConstant et al.
(2013).
The German data are based on the Tiger corpus (Brants et al., 2002), and convertedto constituent and dependency following (Seeker and Kuhn, 2012).
The Hebrew data set is based on theModern Hebrew Treebank (Sima?an et al., 2001), with the Goldberg (2011) dependency version, in turnaligned with the phrase structure instance described in (Tsarfaty, 2010; Tsarfaty, 2013).
Note that inorder to match the Hebrew unlabeled data encoding, the Hebrew treebank was converted back to UTF-8.The Hungarian data are derived from the Szeged treebank (Csendes et al., 2005; Vincze et al., 2010),while the Korean data originate from the Kaist Treebank (Choi et al., 1994) which was converted todependency for the SPMRL shared task by Choi (2013).
The Polish treebank we used is described in(Wolin?ski et al., 2011; S?widzin?ski and Wolin?ski, 2010; Wro?blewska, 2012).
Compared to the last year?sedition, we added explicit feature names in the relevant data fields.
The Swedish data originate from(Nivre et al., 2006), we added function labels extracted from the original Swedish XML data.
Notethat in addition to constituency and dependency versions, the Polish, German and Swedish data sets arealso available in the Tiger XML format (Mengel and Lezius, 2000), allowing a direct representation ofdiscontinuous structures in their phrase-based structures.5 ConclusionAt the time of writing this short introduction, the shared task is ongoing, and neither results nor the finalsubmitting teams are known.
At this point, we can say that 15 teams registered for the 2014 sharedtask edition, indicating an increased awareness of and continued interest in the topic of the shared task.Results, cross-parser and cross-data analysis, and shared task description papers will be made availableat http://www.spmrl.org/spmrl2014-sharedtask.html.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to express our gratitude to the original treebank labeled and unlabeled data contribu-tors for the considerable time they devoted to our shared task.
