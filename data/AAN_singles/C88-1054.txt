JacobsArtificial Intelligence ProgramGE Research and Development Cenl;erSchenectady, NY 12301 USAAbstractThe topic of BIDIltECT1ONAL1TY~ using common knowledgein language processing for both anMysis and generation, isof both practical and theoretical concern.
Theoretically, itis important to determine what knowledge structures canbe applied to both.
Practically, it is important that a cmn-petent natural anguage system be ~ble to generate out-puts tilat are relevant to the inputs it understands, with-out exce~:sive r dundancy.
Tiffs problem revolves aroundthe ~bility to relate linguistic structures declaratively totheir mc~ming.1 In t roduct ionBIDIRECTIONALITY, or the ability to use a cormnon knowledgebase for both language anMysis mid generation, is a desirablefeature of a reM language proccssing system.
A natural an-guage "front end" must not only perform syntactic anMysis,but must derive a suitable representation f a meaning or in-tention from a linguistic input.
A natural anguage generatorperforms the: inverse task of producing a linguistic utterancefi'om a nmm~ing or intention.
A bidirectional system performsboth tusks using as much shaxed knowledge as possible.Two praeticM concerns motivate this work: (1) A systemthat uses shax'ed knowledge for analysis and generation willproduce output ix* the subset of laa.lgu~ge that it understands,thus avoiding inconsistences between the input and output, and(2) Using shared knowledge avoids the inefficiency of havingdistinct encodings of the same linguistic information.The first concern, having a naturM language interface"speak" the same language it understands, is more than a con-veniencc.
Responses in a dialogue often use a word or phrasethat has been mentioned by another speaker.
This cannot bedone effectively unless the word or phrase is common to boththe input and output language.
A computer user will expectthe system to understand a phrase or construct hat the sys-tem has itsel\[ used; this aggravates the consequences of incon-sistencies between input and output language.
Moreover, ifan interface is to be traalsportable across domains, a distinctsubset of language will be applicable to each domain.
The bidi-rectional knowledge base allows both the input and output tobe constrained simultaneously.The second concern, efficiency of knowledge representa-tion, becomes more compelling as the lexical and semantic a-pabilities of natural language systems increase.
While thereis ample motivatioz, for having a common grammar fox" anal-ysis and ge:oeration, the need for a common lexicon is evenstronger.
H~ving two lexicons is counterintuitive; what makespractical sense is to have a single lexicon indexed differentlyfor gene.ration fl'om analysis.
Now that many systems havemore mid more knowledge built into their lexicons, the effectsof redundancy become more &'astie.
When more informationis required of the lexicon, however, the difficulties in developinga shared lexicon are more pronounced.The principal concern in designing a natural hmguage sys-tem that performs both analysis and generation, thereibre, isa bidirectional lexicon.
The main issue to be eonsidered hereis wt,at information mst be included in this lexicon and howbidirectional lexiea./knowledge should be structured.2 I ssues  Regard ing  B id l rec t iona l i tyThere h~s been very little reseaxch in language generation rela-tive to language understanding and syntactic analysis.
A negli-gible amount of research as addressed the t)roblem of bidirec-tionality.
Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexi-cal semantics \[aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831and on grammatical frameworks uitable for bidirectional sys-tems \[Kay, 1984\].
At the recent TINLAP (Theoretical Issuesin Natural Language Processing) conference \[Wilks, 1987\], po-sition papers brought out a number of points concerning bidi-rectionality that had not previously appeared in the literature.The positions largely embraced the need for knowledge sharedbetween a.nalysis and generation while laying out the practicslreasons why bidirectional systems are not prevMent.A good summary of' issues in bidireetionality is found in\[Mann, 1.987\].
Erich aspect of the generation process can berelated to some part of language analysis that seems to drawfl'om common knowledge.
However, the processes themselvesas well as the problems involved in building actuM languageprocessing systems differ, to such an extent that scientists donot find the time to attend to the common issues.
Anotherpoint is that both fields, especially generation, largely ignorethe problem of lexical semantics \[Maxcus, 1987\], a problem thatmight help to bring the tasks closer together.It is a mistake to treat analysis and generation as comopletely independent tasks.
Given that the goal of much of natu-ral language research is to program computers to communicatein the way people do, the ideal natural anguage program mustuse natural anguage us both a "front end" and a "back end".Knowledge that has tfistorieally been used more in generation,pertaining to text structure, coherence, and constraints on lex-.ical choice, influences the analysis task.
Knowledge primarilyapplicable to analysis, such as vocabulary and grammaticalcoverage, and information applied to ambiguity mtd vagueness~can be applied to generation as well.
The problem of linguis-tic knowledge base design is thus fundamentally different for abidirectional system.3 The  B id i rec t iona l  Lex iconSeveral characteristics are essential to a lexicon that can beused effectively in both analysis and generation:2671.
Principally, the lexicon and knowledge base of the systemmust be declarative; all the material must take the formof data structures rather than rules or program code.2.
The semantic omponent of the lexicon; i. e. the rep-resentation of word meanings and word senses, must besufficient o guide lexical choice in generation and to re-solve vague or ambiguous words in analysis.3.
Lexical collocations, phrasal lexemes, and grammaticalconstructions must be represented.
This compound lexicalknowledge is necessary in generation because the selectionof a particular word influences the selection of other wordsin a phrase, even when the phrase is internally grammati-cal.
The knowledge is important in analysis in so far as itcan aid in handling multiple word senses.Most systems satisfy the declarative requirement above,although the degree to which knowledge is proceduralizedvaries greatly from one model to another.
The second and thirdrequirements, the richness of lexical semantics and the need forcompound knowledge , are more often overlooked.
In genera-tion, a lexical entry that lists a word stem and a correspondingset of linguistic and semantic features is not enough; what isneeded is a relationship between the lexlcal item and a knowl-edge representation structure \[Jacobs, 1986\] and a means ofselecting the lexical item from among the other possible words\[Mathiessen, 1981\].
A word choice is not made independentlyfrom other choices; lexical choices have a direct influence onother lexical choices \[Jacobs, 1985\].Lexical knowledge used primarily for generation can im-pact the way language analysis is performed, and vice versa.The following simple examples help to illustrate how complexlexical knowledge required for generation can also affect under-standing:?
(la) Hit the "return" key.?
(lb) Hit the "x" key.?
(2a) Type "return".?
(2b) Type "x".?
(3a)Hit "return".?
(3b) Hit "x".A generation system needs a variety of lexical knowledgein order to produce utterances such as (3a), which is natural formost native speakers.
In addition to knowledge about the wordsense of "hit", the system must know what keys are suitablefor "hitting", as well as that "hit" is used to describe strikinga single key.
This detailed lexical knowledge should also avoidusing (2a) in place of (3a), since one cannot use "type" fora key that does not produce a character or text.
Now, giventhat this knowledge is required for the appropriate generationof the utterances above, it makes sense that it should be usedin determining the difference in meaning between (2a) and (3a)(the former means "Hit the sequence of keys r-e-t-u-r-n).
Indesigning a system strictly for analysis, one would tend to dis-tingtiish (2a) from (3a) by assnming "hit" to have a differentmeaning fl'om "type", and thus produce two incorrect but rela-tively subtle effects: First, the meanings of (2b) and (3b) wouldalso be different, and second, (3b) would be equally acceptableto (3a).Because a generation system must have enough informa-tion in the lexicon to make appropriate l xical choices, it musthave lexical knowledge that relates the specific word sensesabove to the linguistic context in which they are used.
A lin-guistic analyzer can then use this knowledge to make moreaccurate interpretations of the same words.
This is a typicalway in which lexical choice and word sense determination arerelated.4 FLUSHAn example of a lexicon designed with the three characteristicsdescribed in the previous ection is FLUSH (Flexible LexiconUsing Structured Hierarchical knowledge) \[Besemer and Ja-cobs, 1987\].
FLUSH combines a hierarchical phrasal exicon\[Wilensky and Arens, 1980, Jacobs, 1985, Dyer and Zernik,1986\] with declarative relations between language and mean-ing \[Jacobs and Rau, 1985\].
For example, figure 1 shows partof the lexical knowledge about the preposition "to", used ina prepositional phrase modifying either a verb or noun.
Thelexical relation to-pmod represents this linguistic ategory, andconstrains how it can be used in a surface structure, based onits membership in the more general rood-tel (modifying rela-tion) category.Figure 2 shows how the to-pmod relation is associatedwith a generalized transfer event (either a physical transferor a transfer of possession), with the object of the prepositiondescribing the destination of the transfer.
The link marked"REF" in figure 2 represents this sort of association betweena linguistic and a conceptual structure.
More specific trans-fers, as well as metaphorical "VIEWs" of transfers, are alsoexplicitly represented in this diagram.
Knowledge about sensesof "sell", "tell", and "send?, as well as constructs using suchverbs, is thus represented in a neutral fashion.Conceptual Structures Linguistic Structures~-t ra~"~ ~ .

Fig-Ure 3 shows how such knowledge is encoded: It-give-hug, thelexical category for "giving a hug" and other variations onthe same expression, belongs to a general category, linguis~tic/conceptual, which accounts for its linguistic flexibility suchas its potential use in the passive voice.
A "REF" associationlinks Ic-give-hug to the hugging concept, indicating declara-tively that these expressions describe a hugging action rather2'68I whole-verb___~Dbase-va\[ mod-va\[ compound-lexeme j I prep-phrase \]D ~ npm - -' rood "mod-'~l mqdynpm _Jprep-rootFigure 1: The modifying-relation compound-lexeme hierardiy.than a literal sense of "give".- -  DI ' m "~ '"lexeme II~1 " 1  e~le-fiive-xxx \]\[/o IFigure 3: The linguistic/conceptual re ation Icr-give-hug.Th$.,~e xamples, while only touching upon the lexical rep-resentatio:a of FLUSH, shows some of the characteristics ofa birectional lexicon.
The hierarchy of linguistic structures al-lows access to these structures for both analysis and generation.Declarative links between linguistic and conceptual entities al-low specific knowledge about linguistic expression to be usedin hoth processes.
The current ask is to encode enough infor-mation in this form so that analysis and generation alike canbe robustly performed.5 Conc lus ionUsing certMn knowledge for both analysis and generation is de-sirable in ;~ natural anguage system, for both theoretical andpractical reasons.
This bidirectionality aids efficiency as well asinsuring compatibility between analysis and generation compo-nents.
A lexicon designed for bidirectionality differs distinctlyfi:om one designed for either generation or analysis alone, andoften develops aspects of each process that might otherwise beoverlooked.References\[Besemer and Jacobs, 1987\] David Besemer and Paul S. Ja-cobs.
