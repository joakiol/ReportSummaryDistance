A DESCRIPTION OF THE VESPRA SPEECH PROCESSING SYSTEMRolf  HaberbeckFU Ber l inFB GermanistikD-tO00 Ber l in  33TU Ber l inFB In format ikD-tO00 Ber l in  10ABSTRACTThe VESPRA system is designed for  theprocessing of chains of (not connectedutterances of)  wordforms.
These s t r ingsof wordforms correspond to sentencesexcept that  they are not rea l i sed  inconnected speech.
VESPRA means:Verarbeitung und Erkennung gesprochenerSprache (processing and recogn i t ion  ofspeech).
VESPRA w i l l  be used to cont ro ld i f fe rent  types of machines by voiceinput ( fo r  instance: non c r i t i ca lcont ro l  funct ions  in cars and int rucks ,  voice box in d ig i ta l  te lephonesystems, text  processing systems,d i f fe rent  types of o f f i ce  work-s ta t ions ) .I .The VESPRA system consists  of f i vecomponents:I)  the noise reduct ion un i t ;2) the phonet ic feature  ext rac t ion  andpat tern  recogn i t ion  un i t ;3) an ATN grammar , a d ia log  model anda model of the cont ro l led  machlne;4) a machine cont ro l  and d ia loggenerat ion un i t ;5) a user f r iend ly  software developmentenvironment.2.In d i f fe rence  to common speechprocessing systems VESPRA has anin tegrated  noise reduct ion un i t .
Thisnoise reduct ion un i t  is contextsens i t i ve .
Depending on the type ofnoise several  types of f i l te rs  w i l lreduce the noise corresponding to theactual  s i tuat ion  in which the system isused.
Analog and d ig i ta l  f i l te r ingmethods w i l l  be used.
Noise has been upto now a big problem which made a wideuse of speech processing systemsimpossib le.
The noise reduct ion ist r iggered  by the actual  state of themachine and the general acoust ica lenvironment.
VESPRA w i l l  be able torecognize 500 wordforms speakerdependent and 100 wordforms speaker nonsens i t i ve .An ATN grammar processes a l l  meaningfulsentences on the basis of thesewordforms ( inc lud ing  reduced forms of618sentences) .
The resu l t  of  th i s  lex ica \ ] ,syntact i ca l ,  semant ica l  and pragmat ica lp rocess ing  is s to red  in the d ia logmemory or compared w i th  the content  ofthe d ia log  memory.
The in terpretedcommand input  is  processed by the modelof the ac tua l  s ta te  of  the cont ro l ledmachine.
I f  a command by the user  is inconf l i c t  w i th  the genera l  s ta te  of  thecont ro l led  machine VESPRA in forms theuser by vo ice  output  or  by v i sua loutput .
The vo ice  output  w i l l  berea l i sed  by LPC coded speech and isinc luded in the VESPRA system.
Thev i sua l  output  depends on theposs ib i l i t i es  o f fe red  by the cont ro l ledmachine.
I f  a command by the user isnot in conf l i c t  w i th  the genera l  s ta teof the cont ro l led  machine the VESPRAsystem : j ives  an ins t ruct ion  to  thecont ro l led  machine,  lhe  in ter facebetween VESPRA and the cont ro l ledmachine is des igned in a way thata l lows  to  connect  var ious  types ofsensors and actors  to  VESPRA.There is a feedback cont ro l  between thelex ica l ,  syntact i ca l ,  semant ica l  andpragmat ica l  p rocess ing  un i t  and thephonet ic  ext rac t ion  and pat ternrecogn i t ion  un i t  in o rder  to opt imizethe phonet ic  p rocess ing  and theprocess ing  of  the cha ins  of  word forms.The d ia log  model and the model of  thecont ro l led  machine cont ro l  the no isereduct ion  un i t .
