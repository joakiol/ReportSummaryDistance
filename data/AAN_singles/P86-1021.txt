THE INTONATIONAL STRUCTURING OF DISCOURSEJulia Hirschberg and Janet PierrehumbertAT&T Bell Laboratories600 Mountain AvenueMurray Hill NJ 07974 USAABSTRACTWe propose a mapping between prosodic phenomena ndsemantico-pragmatic effects based upon the hypothesis that intona-tion conveys information about the intentional as well as the atten-tional structure of discourse.
In particular, we discuss how varia-tions in pitch range and choice of accent and tune can help to con-vey such information as: discourse segmentation and topic struc-ture, appropriate choice of referent, the distinction between 'given'and 'new' information, conceptual contrast or parallelism betweenmentioned items, and subordination relationships between proposi-tions salient in the discourse.
Our goals for this research are prac-tical as well as theoretical.
In particular, we are investigating theproblem of intonational ssignment in synthetic speech.1.
In t roduct ionThe role of prosody in discourse has been generally ack-nowledged but little understood.
Linguistic pragmaticists havenoted that types of in fo rmat ion  s ta tus  (such as g lven /new,top lc /comment ,  focus /presuppos i t ion)  can be intonationally'marked' \[1,2,3,4\], that  re fe rence  reso lu t ion  may depend criti-cally on intonation \[5, 6\], that  intonation can be used to disambigu-ate among potentially ambiguous utterances \[7,8\], and thati nd i rec t  speech  acts  may be signalled by intonationalmeans \[9,10,11\].
Conversational analysis of naturally occurringdata has found that speakers may signal top ic  shift ,  d igress ion,and in ter rupt ion ,  as well as tu rn - tak ing ,  intonation-ally \[12, 13, 141 .
And the fact that intonational contours contributein some way to utterance interpretation is itself unexception-able \[8\].
To date, however, identification of the prosodicphenomena involved -- and the proper mapping between thcsephenomena nd their semantico-pragmatic effects -- has beenlargely intuitive, and the intonational phenomena involved havenot been precisely described.Here, we describe how certain of the resources of the intona-tional system are employed in discourse.
In particular, we discusshow speakers' choice of p i tch  range,  accent ,  and tune  contributeto the in tent iona l  and a t tent lona l  structuring of discourse -- theway speakers communicate the relationships among their discoursegoals and the relative salience of entities, attributes, and relation-ships mentioned in the discourse) Our findings emerge from anintensive study of a simple example of speech synthesis: the scriptof a computer-aided instruction system, TNT (Tutor 'n'Trainer) \[16\], which employs synthetic speech to tutor computernovices in the text editor vi.
Using the Text to Speech system(TTS) i17\], we have been able, by systematic variation of pitch1.
Grosz and Sidaer \[15\] propose a tripartite view of discourse structure: allngnlstlc structure, which is the text/speech itself; an attentlonal struc-ture, including information about he relative salience of objects, properties,relations, and intentions at a given point in the discourse; and an Intentionalstructure, which relates dlscourse segment purposes (those purposes whoserecognition is essential to a segment achieving its intended effect) to oneanother.range and by a principled choice of accent and tune, to highlightthe structure of the tutorial text and thus to enhance its coherence.While most studies of how intonation is used in discourse, havebeen based solely on examination of intonational contours found ina natural corpus, we have found that intonation synthesis providesa unique opportunity to manipulate the dimensions of variationorthogonally.
Thus we can pinpoint factors crucial for a giveneffect and evaluate various patterns for a given utterance and con-text.2.
The  DomainTNT was designed to teach computer-naive subjects vi, asimple UNIX screen-oriented text editor.
The tutorial portion pro-vides a brief introduction to word processing, to general features ofvi, and to the tutor's help facilities; the tutor then guides subjectsthrough a series of learning tasks of graduated ifficulty.
Whilethe overall task structure is implicit in the tutorial text, the sub-ject can influence the course of the interaction via his/her manipu-lation of a set of 'helper' keys; these keys provide hints (HINT) andreminders (REMIND) as well as the option of start ing a task overagain (DO OVER) or suspending the tutorial temporarily (HOLD).The fact that  TNT is explicitly task-oriented, 2 makes it agood test-bed for our purposes.
An appropriate segmentation ofthe text, and a notion of the purpose of each segment and thehierarchical relationships among segments, can be independentlydetermined from the task at hand.
Also, certain characteristics ofthe text presented a particularly interesting challenge for ourstudy.
First, the script contains little pronominal reference andvery few so-called clue words  - words  and phrases such as now,next, returning to, but, and on the other hand, which can identifydiscourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments,signal interruptions and digressions, and so on \[19,20\].
Both ofthese phenomena (together with intonation) have been identified asimportant strategies for communicating discourse struc-ture \[15,18,19\].
Their virtual absence from the text presents aconvenient opportunity for testing the power of intonation tostructure a discourse.
Second, while we were not able to isolatepoints in the text where subjects had special difficulties, we didinformally observe certain general problems with tu rn - tak ing  3 inthe tutor -- specifically, it was not always clear when the tutor'sturn was over - which we addressed in our synthesis of the text.3.
FO Synthes isTo synthesize the fundamental frequency (f0) contours forthe TNT script, we used the intonation synthesis program2.
That is, the tutorial is organized around aseries of data processing tasks, whichthe subject is guided through.
See \[18\] for discussion of the characteristics oftask-oriented domain discourse.3.
The process by which speakers signal that they have (temporarily) finishedspeaking and by which hearers interpret such signals \[21\].136described in \[22\] in \[23, 24\].
It permits explicit control over the dif-ferent dimensions of variation in the intonation system.
Thedimensions we will discuss here are phras ing,  p i tch range,accent location, and tune.

The TNT Introduct ionIn Figure 1 and in all figures below, 'T '  indicates the top of thepitch range in Hz, 'F '  indicates amount of compression of the pitchrange at the end of declarative phrases, 'H' and 'L' indicate highand low tones, '*' indicates a tone's alignment with a stressed syll-able, and '%'  indicates a phrase boundary tone.
We discuss thesephenomena and our notational system in more detail below.3.1 Phras ingThe first dimension of variation, phras ing,  may be indi-cated by a pause, by a lengthening of the phrase-final syllable, andby the occurrence" of extra melodic elements on the end of thephrase.
Variation in phrasing is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.
4 InFigure 2, line 8 is produced as a single phrase, whereas in Figure 3,And is set off as a separate phrase.One consequence of this strategy is that And becomes more prom-inent in the second version.
Phrasing variation will not be of cen-tral concern here.
Because of the syntactic simplicity of TNT,there were only a few cases where the phrasing could be varied ininteresting ways.4.

Two Phrases3.2 P i tch  RangeWhen a speaker aises his/her voice, his/her overall p i tchrange - the distance betweer~ the highest point in the f0 contourand the speaker's basel ine (defined by the lowest point a speakerrealizes over all utterances) -- is expanded.
Thus, the highestpoints in the contour become higher and other aspects are propor-tionately affected.

Actual Pitch RangeThe shape of the actual contour is the same as in Figure 4 but itsscaling is different.
Changes in pitch range appear to reflect theoverall structure of the discourse, with major topic shifts markedby marked increases in pitch range.In addition to variations in overall pitch range, the intona-tion system exploits a local time-dependent type of pitch rangevariation, called final lowering.
In the experiments reportedin \[24\], it was found that the pitch range in declaratives i loweredand compressed in .anticipation of the end of the utterance.
Finallowering begins about half a second before the end and graduallyincreases, reaching its greatest strength right at the end of theutterance.
This phenomenon appears to reflect the degree of 'final-ity' of an utterance; the more final lowering, the more the sensethat an utterance 'completes' a topic is conveyed.

Without Final LoweringIn the notational system employed here, T represents thetopl ine, of a phrase -- the maximal value for the f0 contour in thephrase.
F expresses the amount of final lowering in terms of theratio of the lowered pitch range to the starting pitch range.
Thedefault value assumed below for T is 115 Hz and for F is 0.87.3.3 AccentP i tch  accents,  which fall on the stressed syllable of lexicalitems, mark those items as intonationally prominent.
In line 16, forexample, right has no pitch accent.
If right were to be especiallyemphasized, it would have an accent.
(In our notation, the absenceof a specified accent indicates that a word is not  accented; wherewe wish to highlight this point, we will employ '-' to mark a deac-cented word.)

Right AccentedIn the first case, the last f0 peak occurs on work and there is a fallto a low pitch on right, then a rise at the end of the phrase.
In thesecond case, the entire peak-fall-rise configuration occurs on theword right.There are six types of pitch accent in English \[23\], two sim-ple tones -- high and low -- and four complex ones.
The most fre-quently used accent, the simple high tone, comes out as a peak onthe accented syllable (as, on right in Figure 9) and will berepresented below as H*.
The 'H' indicates a high tone, and the '*'that the tone is aligned with a stressed syllable.
In some cases, wehave used a L* accent, which occurs much lower in the pitch rangethan H* and is phonetically realized as a local f0 minimum.
Theaccent on make in Figure 13 below is a L*.
The other Englishaccents have two tones.
Figure 10 shows a version of the sentencein Figures 2 and 3 with a L+t t*  accent substituted for both H*accents in the second phrase.138t50  _t25t00  :l 75-I0ae  nnd ~ i~ i I i rr Iri !

This accent,like other bitonal accents, triggers a rule which compresses thepitch range on following material in the phrase, a phenomenonknown as downstep  or catathes ls .
For example, a simple con-trast between H* H* and H*+L H*+L is illustrated in Figures 11and 12 in two versions of the tutorial command to hit the 'remind'helper key -- Hit remind.

H*+L H*+L L L~oWe have made particular use of downstepped contours uch as this-- i.e., sequences of H*4-L tones -- which we will term H*+Lsequence  in the discussion below.
(See Section 4.3.)
The way aspeaker is structuring a text helps to determine where pitchaccents will fall, as a speaker indicates how referents of accented ordeaccented items are related to other items in the utterance or insome larger context.In addition to pitch accents, each intonational phrase has aphrase  accent  and a boundary  tone.
These two extra tonesmay be either L or H. The boundary tone (indicated by '~o') fallsexactly at the phrase boundary, while the phrase accent (indicatedby an unadorned H or L) spreads over the material between thelast pitch accent and the boundary tone.
Each intonational phrasecontains one or more pitch accents, a phrase accent, and a boun-dary tone.3.4 TuneA phrase's tune  or melody is defined by its particularsequence of pitch accents, phrase accent, and boundary tone.Thus, H* L L~o represents a tune with a H* pitch accent, a Lphrase accent, and a L~:~ boundary tone.
This is an ordinarydeclarative pattern with a final fall.
A interrogative contour isrepresented by L* H H~o.
The contrast between these two melo-dies is illustrated in Figures 13 and 14.
Figure 13 shows the actualf0 contour for line 5 of the TNT introduction, produced as a ques-tion.

Declarative ContourWith the declarative intonation characteristic of imperatives, 5would probably convey that the hearer was being ordered to pro-duce a typo.
Roughly speaking, the tune appears to convey infor-mation about speaker attitudes and intentions (as, the speech actthe speaker intends to perform) and about the relationship betweenutterances in a discourse.1394.
In tonat iona l  and Discourse PhenomenaThe major questions underlying our research are: First,what is the relationship between particular'-,intonationalphenomena nd particular discourse phenomena?~ For example,what discourse phenomena re associated with eh?~iges in pitchrange?
With the accenting or deaccenting of particular lexicalitems?
With choice of tune?
More generally, we also characterizethe contributions of these intonational phenomena in terms of thetheory.of, discourse structure developed in \[15\], by relating intoua-tionM .contributions to aspects of intentional and attentionaldiscourse structure.
Second, how do int0na~ionul features uch asthese interact with one another?
Does an expansion of pitch rangeaffect the interpretation of a rise-fal l-r ise contour \[25\], for exam-ple, and if so how?
Third, when several discourse features predictconflicting intonational strategies, how is a decision made?
Whenthe information represented by a single referring expression, forexample, is both 'given' and 'contrastive' -- and thus both deac-centable and accentable -- how is the choice to be made?4.1 P i tch  Range Man ipu la t ionStudents of discourse commonly observe that discoursesoften exhibit a hierarchical structure - into major topics, theirsubtopics, sub-subtopics, and so on.
In task-oriented omains, ithas been claimed that this structure reflects the hierarchical struc-ture of a task and its subtasks \[18\].
So, for example, the TNTintroduction above might be segmented as follows (where utter-ances are labeled by line number): 5Tab le  1.
Segmenting the TNT Introduction{03 46 7 9 10 11This bracketing schema defines a discourse segment as any nodetogether with all the nodes it dominates; for example, lines 1-11form a segment, as do lines 14-16, and so on.
An alternative depic-tion of the hierarchy above would be \[{0}\[1/2 3 \[4 \[5 6 7\] \[8 9 1011\]\]\] \[12 \[13\] [14 15 16\]\]\]fi Evidence for such hierarchical segmenta-tion in general is found in instances of pronominal reference toreferents linearly distant in the discourse; in such cases, a notion ofhierarchical proximity appears plausible.Previous research \[12,14\] has observed that 'topic jump'can be signalled by raised pitch, as well as increased a~plitude andmarkers of self-editing, hesitation, and discontinuity - .and  thatpauses and changes in rate characterize segment boundaries.
Inour work with the TNT script, we found that a hierarchical seg-mentation of discourse can be marked by systematic variation inpitch range, which can signal movement betweeen levels in the seg-ment hierarchy.
In addition, by varying the amount of final rais'ihgor lowering at the end of phrases, we can indicate the degree ofconceptual continuity between one phrase and the next.
We havedeveloped algorithms for assigning pitch range and fiualraising/lowering in terms of the discourse segmentation.5.
We do not claim this is the only possible segmentation, ly that it is a plausi-ble one to convey.6.
Note that I and 2 are treated as a unit here, although they are synthesized asseparate phrases, since it seemed semantically correct.To illustrate the algorithms, we relate the TNT introductionpresented in Figure 1 to its segmentation i Table 1.
When theintroduction is synthesized using the TTS'default pitch range of75-11~ Hz, the topline for each utterance will remain around 115Hz.
However, the hierarchical relationship schematized aboveamong the various segments may be signalled more clearly if thepitch range is varied.
In our version of the script, each segmentboundary is marked by a variation in pitch range which correlateswith the segment's position in the overall discourse.
So, majorboundaries are denoted by the largest increases, with smallerincreases marking subsegment boundaries, and so on.
The segmentbeginning at 1, for example, is marked by raising the f0 topline to150 Hz; that beginning at 14, by raising the topline to 136 Hz; andthat beginning at 15, by raising the topline to 125 Hz.
7 Humanspeakers do seem to employ a wider spectrum of pitch range varia-tion than we have been able to use in synthesis, however.We would claim that the appropriateness of changes in pitchrange is a function of the segmentation hierarchy -- and is notinherent in the utterance in isolation.
Our algorithm for pitchrange assignment can in fact enforce one segmentation of a givendiscourse over another and, in so doing, can disambiguate amongpotentially ambiguous reference resolutions.
For example, It in line7 of Figure 1 coindexes mistake, while it in line 8 coindexes wordprocessing.
A simple linear approach to reference resolution (suchas \[26\] ) would have the second coindexical with the previousnoun-phrase (np), mistake, but a hierarchical approach to discoursestructure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segmentdominating the current segment may also provide a referent \[18\],as, in fact, is the case here.
While a little thought will make theappropriate referent clear, it is clearer when line 8 is producedwith a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subseg-ment of the segment headed by 4.
By so doing, we lessen the possi-bility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines.
:5-7..Themost likely candidate, found in 4, is now both intonationally andconceptually 8's superordinate discourse segment.While an increase in the pitch range indicates egment boun-daries, a decrease in the final lowering effects can indicate theabsence of such boundaries, and thus indicate that a given utter-ance and one which follows it are part of the same segment.
So,manipulation of final lowering can also serve to indicate discoursestructure, by identifying the internal structure of segments.
Forexample, at one point in the TNT script, the following utteranceconstitutes an entire discourse segment, so it has ,the default finallowering (F=0.87); in consequence, the L~ tone at the end of hadwill be only 87% as high as it would have been if final lowering hadnot applied.F.87 Type had.H* H* L L~Compare this with:Type had.F.93 H* H* L L~When you ' re  done,H* L H~hit  changer.H* L L~Here, the same utterance is synthesized with less final lowering --the L~ tone at the end of had, in particular, will attain 93% of itstarget height.
In this segment, the first line does not  end the seg-ment.
We further propose that the degree of final lowering maycorrelate with the utterance's position in the discourse hierarchy.Specifically, we suggest hat minimal final lowering may indicate a'push' onto the segment stack and greater degrees of final loweringOur choice of ranges was determined in part by the TTS  synthesizer, whichtends to sound best when its topline ranges between 115-150 Hz.
Preliminaryinvestigation of pitch range changes in human speech indicates that, for malespeakers, these choices are reasonable.
Note also that it is the relationshipamong different range levels, not the actual values in Hz, which is importanthere.140may be associated with 'pops' of this stack.
In our synthesis of theTNT text, we have varied degree of final lowering for such 'pops'based upon the level of the segment which this utterance 'com-pletes' (or, equivalently, the level of the segment the next utterancebegins).
So, to determine the amount of final lowering to assignwhen synthesizing line 7 in the TNT introduction, we first deter-mine whether it completes a segment (representing a pop) or not(representing a push).
If the former, we may note either that itcompletes the segment begun at line 5 (with a topline of 136 Hz), orthat the subsequent segment is begun (by line 8) with a topline of136 Hz.
We assign final lowering of 0.90 when synthesizing line 7based on either observation; this rather large amount (close to thesynthesizer's default maximum of 0,87) conveys a relatively impor-tant change of subtopic within the larger discourse segment byindicating rather more disjunction than we would want, for exam-ple, between lines 9 and 10.We are currently testing the associations between pitchrange/ final lowering variation and discourse structure proposedabove in several ways: by pitch-tracking a large corpus of naturalspeech, 8 by recording and analyzing subjects reading structuredtexts, and by asking subjects to perform tasks such as referenceresolution from texts synthesized with varying pitch ranges.4.2 Accent  P lacementAccent placement, too, can convey information about thestructure of a discourse.
Traditionally, it has been noted thatstress, or accent, can convey information about the focus of anutterance, about given or new information in the discourse, o aboutparallelism, or about contrastiveness.
In more general terms, onemight say that accent placement appears to be associated withGrosz and Sidner's \[15\] at tent lona l  structure -- the salience ofdiscourse ntities, properties, relations, and intentions at any pointin the discourse.
We have particularly noted that the decision toaccent or deaccent some item is sensitive to the position of thatitem in the discourse structure - that is, just as salience is alwaysdetermined relative to some particular context, accent placementmust be determined with respect to the segment in which theaccentable item appears.
We take the position that it is the signal-ing of salience relative to the discourse segment that produces thesecondary effects of given-new distinction, topic-hood or contras-tiveness, and the favoring of one reference resolution over another.One of the more common observations about the role ofaccent placement and the structuring of discourse is that accentcan mark some item in the discourse as in focus - i.e., as 'what isbeing talked about' \[28,29} -- particularly when syntactic orthematic information might predict otherwise.
For example, in thefollowing instructions, erase is accented in line 2 to indicate thatthe action of 'erasing' is the focus of the current ask.1.
Type hello.H* H* L L~2.
Next, let's erase hello.H* L H~ H* H* - L L~3.
Hit hint.H* H* L L~For similar reasons, we accent hello in line 1 and deaccent it in line2.While focus considerations clearly influence accent place-ment, determining accent placement solely on the basis ofutterance-level focus (as proposed in Gussenhoven \[29} and Cull-From interviews collected by A. Kroch and G. Ward and from recordings madeof a radio f inancial advise program by J. H i rschberg and M. Pol lack.Prince \[271 notes that the 'given/new' distinction has been variously defined aspredictable/unpredictable, sa ient/not salient, shared/not shared knowledge,and proposes a more complex taxonomy of 'assumed familiarity' classifyingdiscourse ntities as new, inferrable, or evoked (either textually or situation-ally).
Th is  is closely related -- and often confused with -- the notion of utter-ance topic/ focus.cover and Rochemont \[30\] ) is insufficient.
Considerations such asthe given/new distinction play an important role.Speakers typically deaeeent given information and accentnew information, as when the 'new' information typing is accentedand the 'old' word processing is not in line 3 below:Welcome to word processing.B* H* L L~That's using a computer to write lettersH* H* H* H* H*and reports.H* L L~Word processing makes typing easy.H* H* H* L L~Note that these items are marked as 'given' and 'new' within thecurrent segment -- although they may have other status within thelarger discourse.
Furthermore, items appear 'given' or 'new' notsimply because of prior mention (or lack thereof) in a context butvia 'physical co-presence', where speaker, hearer, and referents arephysically and openly present together; \[31\] shared worldknowledge; or conceptual proximity \[11.
For example, the tutor cantreat m as given in the following text because the student has just(incorrectly) typed mary; the character 'm', the student, and thetutor, are thus physically copresent.Oops.
capital m.H* L H~ H* - L L~The new information is that 'm' is to be capitalized.
Thus cap~alis accented.
Similarly, in the introduction to the tutor presented inFigure 1, we can deaccent m~take because it is a super-cQncept ofthe previously mentioned typo:Make a type?L* H* H H~No problem.H* H* L L~Just back  up, type over the  mistake,H* H* L H~ H* H* L H~and it's gone.H* L L~We also examine how pronominalization i teracts withaccent placement.
Since the ability to pronominalize is itself astandard test of givenness, prowords ,  like other given items, arecommonly deaecented.
If they are accented, the hearer may drawvery different conclusions from an utterance.
The following utter-ance, for example, may well convey an instruction to type the wordsomething or even a reprimand for not typing anything yet:Let's hegln by typing something.H* H* H*Since the TNT script employes little pronominalization, we oftenuse deaccenting to 'intonationally pronominalize' repetitions of lex-ical items.Accent can also signal that a discourse referent other thanthat which would be 'most likely' without special accentuationshould be sought, as in:I.2.We can't answer questions, if you are confused.H* H* H* L H~ H* L L~We have to le~ the computer do all the teaching.H* H* H* H* L LSHere (and in particular at line 1), we is intended to refer to thehumans supervising the testing of the tutor, although thesehumans have not  previously been mentioned in the script.
How-ever, this reference might easily be interpreted as referring to the141tutorial system itself.
Since pronouns -- as 'given' information --are commonly deaccented, we accent this one to indicate that an'unusual' referent should be sought, 10 So, both accent placementand manipulation of pitch range can be used to reorder the list ofpotential referents for a given referring expression.FinMly, eontrastiveness or parallelism may also be commun-icated via accent.
For example, second is accented in 3, although itis certainly given in this segment (via mention of second draft in 1):I. Nned a second draft?L* L* L* H H~2.
No problem.H* H* L L~3.
Just change the first, and you've got the second.H* H* L H~ H* H* L L~Note that, while second may be 'given' at the discourse segmentlevel, the decision to accent it is based on contrast within a smallercontext, 3.
Furthermore, if this function of accent is ignored, con-trastiveness may be inferred incorrectly.
If we accent we in thelast line of the tutorial introduction WE will help you out, for exam-ple, the student would be entitled to infer that others will not behelpful.We are currently developing Mgorithms for determiningaccent placement, based upon the interaction of focus, given/new,parallelism, contrastiveness, and pronominal reference within seg-ment and phrase.4.3 Choice of TuneIt is now widely accepted that the overall melody a speakeremploys in an utterance can communicate some semantic or prag-matic information.
However, since there are few particular tunetypes for which we can specify with any confidence just what themeaning might be, it is difficult to generalize about what type ofinformation tunes in generM can convey.
From those tunes whose'meaning' seems fairly well understood -- namely, declarat ive,yes-no quest ion \[23\], surpr l se / redundancy  \[10\], contrad ic t ioncontour  \[33\] r ise-fal l-r lse \[25\], and cont inuat ion  rise \[34,35\]contours -- we propose that tunes convey two sorts of informationabout discourse.First, we believe that contours can convey propos i t ionala t t l tudes  n the speaker wishes to associate with the propositionalcontent of an utterance.
For example, the speaker may wish toconvey that s/he knows x, or that s/he believes x, or that s/he isuncertain about x, or that s/he is ignorant of x.
In the case ofH*+L sequences, it appears that a speaker may convey his/her(propositional) attitudes about a hearer's (propositional) attitudestoward an utterances.
This tune seems to indicate the speaker'sbelief that the speech act s/he is performing is superfluous.
Forexample, a speaker may employ it to convey that the propositionalcontent of his/her utterance is already known or would be obviousto the hearer (who, of course, may or may not be attending to it).Note that the speaker may or may not believe that this informationis known, in order to wish to convey this meaning.
Particularly inpedagogical texts, this contour seems appropriate to introducestraightforward material, as in the following instruction to hit theremind key.Remind, tells you again what to do If you forget.R* L H~ tt* H* H* H* L L~Hit re~ind.H*+L H*+L L L~However, an H*+L sequence is not appropriate in the followingsimilar exchange:I0.
The standard example of accentuation influencing pronominal reference r solu-tion in this way is'john hit Bill and then HE hit HIM 1321.11.
Propositional ttitudes include knowing, believing, intending, uncertainty, andignorance.Next, let's erase hello.H* L H~ H* H* L L~Hit hint.H* H* L L~In general, such contours do not  seem felicitous when theutterance conveys information which the speaker believes will beunexpected for the hearer.
Here tune choice may reflect atten-tional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure.Like the deaccenting of references to given items, t t *+L  sequencecontours eem to convey 'givenness' at a more general level.Second, we believe that tune can convey the speaker's com-mitment o some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship hold-ing between the propositional content of utterances (as, that one'completes' another or is subordinate to another).
Many such rela-tions have been proposed in textual analysis \[36,37,15\].
In thephonological literature, continuation rise has been commonly asso-ciated with some sense of 'continuation' or 'more to come' \[34\].
Wehave found, howe-rer, that this contour can be characterized moreprecisely as conveying a subordination relationship between thephrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in thediscourse segment.
For example, if the second phrase of line 1 isuttered with continuation rise, then this utterance appears to besubordinated to 2.I.
We can't answer questions, if you are confused.H* H* H* L H~ H* L H~2.
We have to let the computer do all the teachlng.H* H* H* H* L L~3.
But if the computer is not working right, we will helpH* H* L H~ H* H*you out.H* L L%That is, 2 'completes' I.
Without continuation rise on 1, all threeutterances will appear to have equal status in th'esegfiaent.
Furth-ermore, continuation rise is not  felicitous in ~.ll ~ontexts in whichthe simple sense that 'there is more to come' clearly should beappropriate; for example, continuation rise over 3 -- at the end ofthe tutorial introduction -- seems quite odd, even though more willclearly follow.In synthesizing the TNT script, we have employed only asmall subset of possible English tunes.
Analysis of the 'meaning' ofadditional tunes is part of our future research.
More generally, wemust examine how structural relationships conveyed by tunes suchas H*+L sequence are ~.ssociated with those conveyed by pitchrange.We have described certain mappings between intonationalfeatures and discourse phenomena, associating pitch range varia-tion with the identification of discourse segments and with theirinternal coherence; accent with types of information status such astopic (focus) and the given/new distinction, with reference resolu-tion and with contrastiveness; and tune choice with~ ~he, relation-ships among propositions in the discourse as well as w~l~b.,~ome pro-positional attitude the speaker wishes to associate with :those pro-positions.
It appears that pitch range and accent placement aremost closely associated with a diseourse's attentional structure,while tune choice is more closely associated with its intentionalstructure.
However, clearly this picture is too simple.
SeverM into-national features may be used together to create some discourseeffect; moreover, in some cases two distinct intonationalphenomena seem to produce discourse ffects that seem intuitivelyto be closely related.
And sometimes several discourse phenomenamay indicate conflicting intonational strategies.
These problemsare the subject of our future research.5.
D iscuss ionThe central thesis of this work is that there are many waysin which intonation helps to structure discourse.
By understandingthe mapping between intonational phenomena and discoursephenomena, we can enhance both our ability to interpret what142speakers try to convey and to synthesize speech more effectively.We have described three major intonational phenomena -- pitchrange, accent, and tune -- and some of the information they allowspeakers to communicate about discourse, demonstrating somelinks between discourse and intonational phenomen~ which havenot been noted in the literature and refining some notions whichhave.
We also identify major issues which future research on therelationship between discourse and intonation must address,including a more precise mapping between discourse and intona-tional phenomena, the interaction of intonational phenomena toproduce particular discourse ffects, and the way conflict betweenintonational strategies signaled by various aspects of the discoursemay be resolved.We are currently testing and refining our hypotheses by 1)pitch tracking recorded natural discourse to determine pitch rangemanipulation, and 2) conducting pilot empirical studies of howprincipled manipulation of pitch range can affect reference resolu-tion.
We are also examining in some detail the relationship betweenpronominalization a d deaccenting, pursuant o the developmentof better accenting algorithms for synthetic speech.
Our ultimategoals are practical as well as theoretical.
Once we have determinedhow particular intonational phenomena are related to particulardiscourse phenomena, the next step is to determine how these find-ings can be applied to natural-language neration.
In particular,how much intonational structuring of generated text can be doneautomatically?
What sorts of information must be represented tosupport he assignment of rhetorically effective intonation?ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank Lloyd Nakatani and Dennis Egan for helpwith TNT, Barbara Gross and Candy Sidner for useful discussions,Mary Beckman, Diane Litman, and Ken Church for comments onearlier drafts, and Mark Liberman for assistance with the TTS sys-tem and the development of its prosody.REFERENCES\[1\] Chafe, W., Givenness, contrastiveness, definiteness, ubjects,topics, and point of view, in Subject and topic, ed.
