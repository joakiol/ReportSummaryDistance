Recently, however, classification and identification of light verbsand light verb construction have become a focus of study in computational linguistics, especially in thecontext of multi-word expression, information retrieval, disambiguation, and parsing.
Past linguistic andcomputational studies on light verbs had very different foci.
Linguistic studies tend to focus on the sta-tus of light verbs and its various selectional constraints.
While NLP studies have focused on light verbsin the context of either a multi-word expression (MWE) or a construction to be identified, classified, ortranslated, trying to overcome the apparent poverty of semantic content of light verbs.
There has beennearly no work attempting to bridge these two lines of research.
This paper takes this challenge by pro-posing a corpus-bases study which classifies and captures syntactic-semantic difference among all lightverbs.
In this study, we first incorporate results from past linguistic studies to create annotated light verbcorpora with syntactic-semantics features.
We next adopt a statistic method for automatic identificationof light verbs based on this annotated corpora.
Our results show that a language resource based method-ology optimally incorporating linguistic information can resolve challenges posed by light verbs in NLP.1 IntroductionIdentification of Light Verb Construction (LVC) plays an important role and poses a special challengein many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, e.g.
information retrieval and machinetranslation.
In addition to addressing issues related to LVC as a contributing factor to errors for vari-ous applications, a few computational linguistics studies have targeted LVC in English specifically(e.g., Tu and Roth, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013).
To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been nocomputational linguistic study dealing with LVCs in Chinese specifically.
It is important to know that,due to their lack of semantic content, light verbs can behave rather idiosyncratically in each language.Chinese LVC, in particular, has the characteristic that allows many different light verbs to share simi-lar usage and be interchangeable in some context.
We should also note that light verbs in Chinese cantake both verbs, deverabal nouns, and eventive nouns, while the morphological status of these catego-ries are typically unmarked, Hence, it is often difficult to differentiate a light verb from its non-lightverb uses without careful analysis of the data.It has been observed that some Chinese light verbs can be used interchangeably but will havedifferent selectional restrictions in some (and generally more limited) contexts.
For example, the fivelight verbs congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo (these words originally meant ?engage?, ?do?, ?inflict?,?proceed?, ?do?
respectively) can all take yanjiu ?to do research?
as their complement and form a LVC.However, only the light verbs gao and jinxing can take bisai ?to play games?
as complements, where-as the other light verbs congshi, jiayi, and zuo cannot.

It is also observed that this kind of selectional versatility actually ledto variations among different variants of Mandarin Chinese, such as Mainland and Taiwan.
The versa-tility of Chinese light verbs makes the identification of LVCs more complicated than English.Therefore, to study the differences among different light verbs and different variants of Chinese isimportant but challenging in both linguistic studies and computational applications.
With annotateddata from comparable corpora of Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese, this paper proposes bothstatistical and machine learning approaches to differentiate five most frequently used light verbs inboth variants based on their syntactic and semantic features.
The experimental results of our approachshow that we can reliably differentiate different light verbs from each other in each variety of Manda-rin Chinese.There are several contributions in our work.
Firstly, rather than focusing on only two light verbsjiayi and jinxing as in previous linguistic studies, we extended the study to more light verbs that arefrequently used in Chinese.
Actually, we will show that although jiayi and jinxing were often dis-cussed in a pair in previous literature, the two are quite different from each other.
Secondly, we showthat statistical analysis and machine learning approaches are effective to identify the differences oflight verbs and the variations demonstrated by the same light verb in different variants of Chinese.Thirdly, we provide a corpus that covers all typical uses of Chinese light verbs.
Finally, the feature setwe used in our study could be potentially used in the identification of Chinese LVCs in NLP applica-tions.This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the data and annotation of the data.
In Sec-tion 3, we conducted both statistical and machine learning methodologies to classify the five lightverbs in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.
We discussed the implications and applications of ourmethodologies and the findings of our study in Section 4.
Section 5 presents the conclusion and ourfuture work.2 Corpus Annotation2.1 Data CollectionThe data for this study is extracted from Annotated Chinese Gigaword corpus (Huang, 2009) whichwas collected and available from LDC and contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, with 700 millioncharacters from Taiwan Central News Agency and 400 million characters from Mainland XinhuaNews Agency.The light verbs to be studied are congshi, gao, jiayi, jinxing, zuo; these five are among the most fre-quently used light verbs in Chinese (Diao, 2004).
400 sentences are randomly selected for each lightverb, half from the Mainland Gigaword subcorpus and the other from the Taiwan Gigaword subcorpus,which resulted in 2,000 sentences in total.
The selection follows the principle that it could cover thedifferent uses of each light verb.2.2 Feature AnnotationPrevious studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2013, amongothers) have proposed several syntactic and semantic features to identify the similarities and differ-ences among light verbs, especially between the two most typical ones, i.e.
jinxing (originally ?pro-ceed?)
and jiayi (originally ?inflict?).
For example, jinxing can take aspectual markers like zhe ?pro-gressive marker?, le ?aspect marker?, and guo ?experiential aspect marker?
while jiayi cannot (Zhou,1987);  congshi can take nominal phrases such as disan chanye?the tertiary industry?
as its comple-ment while jiayi cannot.
A few features are also found to be variant-specific; for example, Huang andLin (2013) find that only the congshi in Taiwan, but not in Mainland Mandarin, can take informal andnegative event complements like xingjiaoyi ?sexual trade?.In our study, we selected 11 features which may help to differentiate different light verbs in eachMandarin variant as well as light verb variations among Mandarin variants, as in Table 1.
All 2,000examples collected for analysis were manually annotated based on the 11 features.

)Table 1: Features used to differentiate five Chinese light verbs.3 Identification of light verbs based on annotated corporaIn this section, we adopted both statistical analysis and machine learning approaches to identify thefive light verbs (jiayi, jinxing, congshi, gao and zuo) on the corpora with 2,000 annotated examples.The results of all approaches show that the five light verbs can be differentiated from each other inboth Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.3.1 Identifying light verbs by statistical analysisBoth univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used in our study for the identification.
Thetool we used is the Polytomous Package in R (Arppe, 2008).773.1.1 Univariate analysisAmong the 11 independent features, one was found with only one level in both Mainland and Taiwanvariants, i.e.
all five light verbs in the two variants show the same preference over the features andthus excluded from the analysis.
The feature is OTHERLV (all light verbs do not co-occur with anotherlight verb in a sentence).
Chi-squared tests were conducted for the significance of the co-occurrence ofthe remaining ten features with individual light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan variants.
Thechisq.posthoc() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R was used for the tests.
Theresults are presented in Table 2, where the ?+?
and ?-?
signs indicate respectively a statistically signif-icant overuse and underuse of a light verb with a feature, and ?0?
refers to a lack of statistical signifi-cance.FeatureNMainland Mandarin Taiwan Mandarincongshi  gao jiayi jinxing zuo congshi gao jiayi jinxing zuoPOS.N 585 + + - 0 0 + + - - -POS.V 1415 - - + 0 0 - - + + +ARGSTR.one 376 0 - - 0 + + - - + 0ARGSTR.two 1039 - 0 + 0 - - - + - +ARGSTR.zero 585 + + - 0 0 + + - - -VOCOMP.no 1939 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 + - 0VOCOMP.yes 61 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - + 0EVECOMP.no 1919 + - + - - + 0 + - 0EVECOMP.yes 81 - + - + + - 0 - + 0ASP.guo 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0ASP.le 155 - - - + + - - - - +ASP.no 1835 + + + - - + + + + -ASP.zhe 1 0 0 0 + 0DUREVT.no 35 - 0 + - - 0 0 + 0 0DUREVT.yes 1965 + 0 - + + 0 0 - 0 0FOREVT.no 66 0 0 - 0 + + - - 0 0FOREVT.yes 1934 0 0 + 0 - - + + 0 0PSYEVT.no 1981 0 0 - 0 0 0 0 0 0 -PSYEVT.yes 19 0 0 + 0 0 0 0 0 0 +INTEREVT.no 1870 + 0 + - + + + 0 - 0INTEREVT.yes 130 - 0 - + - - - 0 + 0ACCOMPEVT.no 1904 + + - + + + + - + 0ACCOMPEVT.yes 96 - - + - - - - + - 0Table 2: Identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via univariate analysis.Table 2 suggests that in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, each light verb shows significantpreference for certain features, and thus can be distinguished from each other.
For example, in Main-land Mandarin, although both congshi and gao show significant preference for the features POS.N andACCOMPEVT.no, congshi differs from gao in that it also significantly prefers DUREVT.yes (takingcomplements denoting durative events, e.g., yanjiu ?to research?
), EVECOMP.no (event complementsdo not occur in subject position), and INTEREVT.no (not taking complements denoting events involv-ing interaction among participants, e.g., taolun ?to discuss?
), whereas gao shows either a dis-preference or no significant preference over these features.
Take gao and zuo in Taiwan Mandarin asanother example.
While both light verbs literally means ?to do?, there is no single feature preferred byboth: gao prefers POS.N, ARGSTR.zero, FOREVT.yes, INTEREVT.no, ACCOMPEVT.no, whereas zuoshows significant preferences for POS.V, ARGSTR.two, ASP.le, and PSYEVT.yes.3.1.2 Multivariate analysisAs shown in Table 2, in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, some of the five light verbs share somefeatures, which thus explains why sometimes they can be interchangeably used.
This also indicates (a)that a particular feature is unlikely to be preferred by only one light verb and thus differentiates theverb from the others; (b) a certain context may allow the occurrence of more than one light verb.
In78this sense, a multivariate analysis was adopted to better classify the five light verbs in each variant.The multivariate analysis used in the current study is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe, 2008),and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumous Package (Arppe, 2008) in R.The results from the multivariate analysis were summarized in Table 3.
The numbers shown in thetable are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: when theestimated odd is larger than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased bythe feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo(76.47:1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), and PSYEVTyes (19.87: 1).When the estimated odd is smaller than 1, the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantlydecreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland jinxing occurring is significantly decreased byACCOMPEVTyes (0.1849: 1); in addition, ?inf?
and ?1/inf?
refer to odds larger than 10,000 andsmaller than 1/10,000 respectively, whereas non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given in paren-theses.Mainland Mandarin Taiwan Mandarincongshi gao jiayi jinxing zuo congshi gao jiayi jinxing zuo(Intercept) (1/Inf) 0.02271 (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1/Inf)ACCOMPEVTyes (1/Inf) 0.09863 56.25 0.1849 (1/Inf) (0.3419) (1/Inf) 11.33 (0.1607) 0.2272ARGSTRtwo 0.2652 2.895 76.47 (1.481) 0.2177 0.1283 (0.7613) (Inf) (0.7062) (1.217)ARGSTRzero (1.097) 3.584 (1/Inf) (1.179) 0.245 (0.6219) 7.228 (4.396) 0.5393 0.2068ASPle (0.7487) (0.1767) (0.8257) (0.9196) (1.853) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (0.3027) (Inf) 32.98ASPno (Inf) (1.499) (Inf) (0.2307) (0.2389) (0.9273) (0.6967) (Inf) (Inf) (0.2385)ASPzhe (1.603) (1/Inf) (0.4571) (Inf) (1/Inf)DUREVTyes (Inf) (2.958) (1/Inf) (Inf) (Inf) (Inf) (Inf) (1/Inf) (0.9575) (Inf)EVECOMPyes (1/Inf) (1.726) (1/Inf) 3.975 (1.772) (1/Inf) (0.8491) (1/Inf) 8.113 (0.5019)FOREVTyes (2.744) (1.227) (Inf) (0.7457) 0.2679 0.0867 (Inf) (Inf) (1.437) (1.467)INTEREVTyes 0.03255 (0.5281) (0.5432) 18.67 0.08902 0.1896 (1/Inf) (0.951) 10.47 (0.398)PSYEVTyes (1/Inf) (1/Inf) 19.87 (1/Inf) (0.9619) (1/Inf) (1/Inf) (1.395) (1/Inf) (3.323)VOCOMPyes (0.1346) (3.043) 23.54 (1.086) (0.5344) 0.18 (2.35) (Inf) 3.161 (0.5956)Table 3: identifying light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin via multivariate analysis.As shown in Table 3, each of the light verbs in each Mandarin variant shows its favor and disfavorof certain features.
Take Mainland Mandarin for example: although congshi has no feature significant-ly in its favor, but it is significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (0.27:1) and ITEREVTyes (0.03:1); gaois disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (0.02:1), and ACCOMPEVTyes (0.1:1), but issignificantly favored by ARGSTRtwo and ARGSTRzero; the chance of jiayi?s ocucrrence is significant-ly increased by ARGSTRtwo(76.47:1), ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25:1), VOCOMPyes (23.54:1), andPSYEVTyes (19:87:1); jinxing has INTEREVTyes and EVECOMPyes in its favor, but ACOMPEVTyesin its disfavor; no feature is significantly in the favor of zuo, but this light verb is significantly disfa-vored by ARGSTRtwo, ARGSTRzero, FOREVTyes and INTEREVTyes.The results in Table 3 also show that sometimes one key feature is able to identify two light verbsfrom each other, although not all five light verbs.
Take Mainland Mandarin again for example.
Mostcombinations of two light verbs from the five can be effectively differentiated by one feature.
For in-stance, the feature ARGSTRtwo can differentiate congshi/gao, congshi/jiayi, jiayi/zuo and gao/zuo; thefeature INTEREVTyes can differentiate congshi/jinxing and jinxing/zuo; the feature ACCOMPEVTyescan differentiate the pairs gao/jiayi and jinxing/jiayi.3.2 Identifying light verbs by classificationIn this section, we resorted to machine learning technologies to study the same issue.
Different classi-fiers were adopted to discriminate the five light verbs with the annotated corpora: ID3, Logistic Re-gression, Na?ve Bayesian and SVM that are implemented in WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) and 10-foldcross validations were performed separately on the Taiwan and Mainland corpora.79The results were presented in Table 4.
We can see that different classifiers provide similar resultson both corpora, which means that the classification results are reliable and the features we annotatedare effective in identifying the five light verbs.
Overall, ID3 out-performs SVM slightly, with Logisticand NB not far behind.
ID3 performs the best since the data is in low dimension.
The detailed resultsincluding precision, recall and F-measure by ID3 on both corpora are shown in Table 5.
The corre-sponding confusion matrixes are presented in Table 6.
The confusion matrixes suggest two very im-portant generalizations: (a) all five verbs can be classified with good confidence, and (b) the overallclassification patterns of the Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are very similar, which is consistent withthe fact that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are two variants.
However, we also observe that the con-fusion matrixes between various light verb pairs may differ between Mainland and Taiwan Chineses.This is the difference we would like to explore in the next section to propose a way to automaticallypredict these two variants.
In addition, it is worth noting that all classifiers identify jiayi more effec-tively than other light verbs, which thus shows a potential different usage of jiayi from the others.ID3 Logistic NB SVMTW ML TW ML TW ML TW MLjingxing 0.365 0.494 0.372 0.455 0.411 0.444 0.422 0.485gao 0.612 0.391 0.609 0.364 0.598 0.377 0.575 0.354zuo 0.571 0.566 0.568 0.582 0.525 0.576 0.574 0.561jiayi 0.759 0.800 0.758 0.807 0.752 0.794 0.759 0.767congshi 0.552 0.646 0.526 0.643 0.486 0.648 0.523 0.633Average 0.574 0.585 0.567 0.576 0.555 0.573 0.571 0.565Table 4: Result in F1-score of 10-fold cross validation of the classification of the five light verbs withdifferent classifiers on the Taiwan (TW) and Mainland (ML) Corpora.Precision Recall F-MeasureTW ML TW ML TW MLjingxing 0.442 0.593 0.311 0.423 0.365 0.494gao 0.681 0.449 0.557 0.347 0.612 0.391zuo 0.610 0.570 0.537 0.562 0.571 0.566jiayi 0.634 0.720 0.946 0.900 0.759 0.800congshi 0.528 0.583 0.579 0.724 0.552 0.646Average 0.580 0.586 0.588 0.599 0.574 0.585Table 5: 10-fold cross validation result of ID3 algorithm on both corpora.jingxing gao zuo jiayi congshiTW ML TW ML TW ML TW ML TW MLjingxing 61 83 15 27 36 40 38 11 46 35gao 20 16 113 70 13 23 24 39 33 54zuo 24 25 8 28 108 118 39 25 22 14jiayi 5 11 0 6 5 6 192 206 1 0congshi 28 5 30 25 15 20 10 5 114 144Table 6: Confusion matrix of the classification with ID3 algorithm on both corpora.3.3 Identifying light verbs by automatic clusteringWe further used the clustering algorithm to test the differentiability of the five light verbs in bothMainland and Taiwan Mandarin.
The results using the simple K-Means clustering algorithm on Tai-wan and Mainland corpora are shown in Table 7.
The results show that the light verb jiayi behaves80quite differently from the other four light verbs in both Mainland and Taiwan corpora, which is similarto the analysis based on statistical methods in Section 3.1 and classification methods in Section 3.2.
Inboth corpora, jiayi has a narrower usage than the other light verbs.
Meanwhile, we can also find a clus-ter which is mainly formed by instances of jiayi from the Mainland corpus (i.e.
cluster 0).
After closerexamination of the examples in this cluster, we found that it mainly includes sentences where jiayitakes complements denoting accomplishment events, e.g.
gaizheng ?to correct?
and jiejue ?to solve?.However, jiayi in Taiwan corpus mainly takes complements denoting activity events, and thus almostall instances of Taiwan jiayi are mixed with those of the other light verbs.
Meanwhile, our resultsshow a tendency that all other light verbs (jinxing, congshi, zuo, and gao) mostly take activity com-plements but fewer accomplishment complements in both Taiwan and Mainland corpora.

Such a module of generic linguistic tools can have several potentiallyvery useful applications.
First, in translation, LVC is one of the most difficult constructions as there isless grammatical or contextual information to make the correct translation.
Our approach is especiallypromising.
As we encode contextual selection information for all light verbs, the same approach canbe applied to the other languages in the target-source pair to produce optimal pair.
Second, in infor-mation extraction, selection of different light verbs often conveys subtle difference in meanings.
Ourability to differentiate similar light verbs in the same context could have great potential in extractingthe subtle information change/increase in the same context.
Lastly, in second language learning as wellas error detection, light verbs have been one of the most challenging ones.
Our studies can be readilyapplied to either error detection or second language learning environment to provide the correct con-text where a certain light very is preferred over another.4.2 From light verb variations to variants for the same languageOne of the biggest challenges in computational processing of languages is probably to identify newlyemergent variants, such as the cross-strait variations of Mandarin Chinese.
For these two variants, themost commonly cited ones were on lexical differences.
Systematic grammatical differences weremuch more difficult to study and hence rarely reported (comp.
Huang et al., 2009).
As these are twonewly divergent variants, their main grammars are almost all identical, except for some subtle differ-ences, such as the selection between different light verbs and their complements.
Our preliminary re-sults of univariate and multivariate analysis can be found in Table 2 and 3.
It shows not only the simi-larities/differences among the light verbs in each variety (e.g., both ML and TW congshi and gaoshow preferences over POS.N, whereas both ML and TW jiayi show dispreference), but also the simi-larities/differences of the corresponding light verbs in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.
For instance,jinxing in TW tends to take VO compounds as its complements e.g., jinxing toupiao ?cast a vote?,81which is consistent with the analysis in (Huang et al., 2013) (see more in Huang et al., 2014).
But onething should be pointed out is the difference is more between a significant and non-significant feature,rather than between a significant positive and significant negative feature.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we addressed the issue of automatic classification of Chinese light verbs based on theirusage distribution, based on an annotated corpus marking relevant contextual information for lightverbs.
We used both statistical methods and machine learning technologies to address this issue.
It isfound that our approaches are effective in identifying light verbs and their variations.
The automaticgenerated semantic and syntactic features can also be used for future studies on other light verbs aswell as other lexical categories.
The result suggested that richly annotated language resources pairedwith appropriate tool can lead to effective general solution for some common issues faced by linguis-tics and natural language processing.AcknowledgementsThe work is supported by a General Research Fund (GRF) sponsored by the Research Grants Council(Project no.
