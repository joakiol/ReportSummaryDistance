The Lexical Component ofNaturalProcessingGeorge A. MillerCognitive Science LaboratoryPrinceton UniversityLanguageAbstractComputational linguistics is generally considered to be the branchof engineering that uses computers to do useful things with linguisticsignals, but it can also be viewed as an extended test of computationaltheories of human cognition; it is this latter perspective that psychol-ogists find most interesting.
Language provides a critical test for thehypothesis that physical symbol systems are adequate to perform allhuman cognitive functions.
As yet, no adequate system for naturallanguage processing has approached human levels of performance.Of the various problems that natural anguage processing has re-vealed, polysemy is probably the most frustrating.
People deal withpolysemy so easily that potential abiguities are overlooked, whereascomputers must work hard to do far less well.
A linguistic approachgenerally involves a parser, a lexicon, and some ad hoc rules for usinglinguistic ontext o identify the context-appropriate sense.
A statisti-cal approach generally involves the use of word co-occurrence statisticsto create a semantic hyperspace where each word, regardless ofits pol-ysemy, is represented asa single vector.
Each approach as strengthsand limitations; some combination is often proposed.
Various possibil-ities will be discussed in terms of their psychological p ausibility.21
