AbstractThe paper proposes an architecture for advancedNLG systems that handle narratives.
Specialattention is paid to document planning.
Domainmodelling and meta-knowledge modelling for anarratological structurer are exemplified.1 IntroductionNatural Language Generation (NLG) systems usually focuson descriptive text types.
Narrative structures are under-represented in NLG.
However, they are encountered inmany naturally occurring texts, and not only in fiction.Often, texts are composed of segments with differentprevailing functions: some are descriptive, some argumenta-tive, others narrative.
Therefore, knowledge about narrativescan be useful also for NLG systems that deal with ?classi-cal?
NLG tasks.
For example, a system that is expected todescribe and compare objects in a museum could includenarrative passages about their use, history or discovery.The discipline concerned with the structure of narrative[Barthes, 1966] and narrative discourse [Genette, 1980] iscalled narratology.
Narratologists distinguish between twomain representational domains of narratives: 1. the story(histoire) as the totality of the narrated events, abstractedfrom their disposition in the text; and 2. the discourse(r?cit) that narrates them [Genette, 1988:13].Narratology has identified a number of descriptiveparameters.
As can be seen from the explanations in Table 1(see Appendix), many parameters describe phenomena thatrelate discourse to story in a specific way.This paper envisages an NLG system with improvedabilities to deal with narrative discourse.
Section 2 summa-rises the relation between Story Generation and NLG.
InSection 3, an architecture for a narratologically enhancedNLG system is proposed.
Section 4 outlines one of the de-scriptive parameters, illustrating the kind of knowledge thatcan be acquired from narratology.
Section 5 exemplifies thedomain modelling, a prerequisite for modelling narratologi-cal knowledge.
Section 6 formalises the selected narra-tological parameter, discusses its mapping onto discoursegraphs used in NLG, and exemplifies its use in a system.Section 7 concludes the paper and mentions future work.2 Story Generation and NLGThis section gives a brief overview of the relationshipbetween Story Generation (SG) and NLG.
Subsection 2.1describes the architectural gap between SG and NLG.Subsection 2.2 discusses the contribution of an existingsystem to fill that gap.
An extended account of work in SGcannot be provided here.
P?rez y P?rez and Sharples [2004]compare and evaluate three recent SG systems.
For adiscussion of earlier systems, see [Ryan, 1991:233?248].2.1 The Story Generation-NLG GapStory Generators aim to produce interesting, understand-able, artistic, and creative stories [Turner, 1994:15].
Indoing so, they focus on the story (histoire) representationaldomain.
For example, the generator MINSTREL [Turner,1994] achieves not only thematic and consistency goals, butalso ?dramatic?
and ?presentational?
goals solely by addingor transforming story events and background information.The story content is directly mapped onto the output text.SG faces the difficult problem of finding an interestingand logically coherent event sequence (story).
Less energyis spent on other tasks, especially at discourse and surfacelevel.
In fact, most implemented SG systems use templatesof different varieties for NLG.
Document structuring andmicroplanning as NLG processing stages [Reiter, 1994;Reiter and Dale, 2000:60] are usually skipped in SG, so thatSG and NLG architectures can be confronted as in Figure 1.Figure 1: Story Generation and Natural Language GenerationNarratological Knowledge for Natural Language GenerationBirte L?nnekerNarratology Research Group HamburgInstitut f?r Germanistik II, University of HamburgVon-Melle-Park 6, D-20146 Hamburgbirte.loenneker@uni-hamburg.deContent det.Doc.

To remedy thesituation, they implemented STORYBOOK, an ?architecturefor narrative prose generation?
[2002:228].
The input toSTORYBOOK must be a ?narrative stream that reflects theorderly progression of events, descriptions and states?
[Callaway and Lester, 2002:231], produced by a hypotheti-cal Story Generator.
STORYBOOK expects this input streamto contain so-called narrative primitives that specify scenechanges and other aspects such as:?
narrative person and focalization (?person, omnis-cience?
[Callaway and Lester, 2002:221]);?
details about dialogue realization (e.g.
whether aninquit phrase such as ?he said?
should precede, followor interrupt direct speech, or whether it should beomitted altogether [Callaway and Lester, 2002:225]).Person and focalization are classical narratological pa-rameters [Genette, 1980].
It is not clear from Callaway andLester [2002] how many different values STORYBOOK actu-ally implements for these parameters; their example tale isinvariably rendered by a ?third person disembodied?
narra-tor [2002:230].
?
The question of whether or not a charac-ter utterance is to be provided with an inquit phrase issometimes subsumed under the narrative distance parameter(cf.
Table 1): Direct speech framed by inquit phrases is defi-nitely considered as imitating, but the highest level of imita-tion is achieved by the reproduction of unframed directspeech [Fludernik, 2005; Genette, 1988:56].In STORYBOOK, many decisions concerning discoursestill lie with the Story Generator that is supposed to producea stream with narrative primitives.
STORYBOOK itself nei-ther decides about narrative person, focalization, or distancefor any given passage, nor is it concerned with any othernarratological parameters listed in Table 1.
Rather,STORYBOOK focuses on microplanning and surface phe-nomena with special attention to features particular to nar-rative.
The architectural contribution of STORYBOOK canthus be seen as reducing the gap between SG and NLG toapproximately the microplanner level, where STORYBOOK,as a specialized NLG system, takes over from a hypotheticalStory Generator (see Figure 2).Figure 2: Story Generation and STORYBOOK3 Narratology for NLGNarratological aspects influence on all architectural modules[Reiter, 1994] or representation levels [Cahill et al, 2000]of NLG.
The most important decisions of a narratologicallyenhanced system concern the document planner with itscontent determination and document structuring sub-tasks (Subsections 3.1?3.2).
Microplanning and surfacerealization (Subsection 3.3) are supposed to resemble classi-cal NLG processes.
As further explained below, the archi-tecture of the envisaged system corresponds to Figure 3.Figure 3: Narratologically enhanced Story Generation-NLG system3.1 Content DeterminationIn a narratologically enriched NLG system, a ?narrativecontent determination module?
might be implemented as aStory Generator.
The Story Generator decides?
what it considers to be a minimal story [Prince, 1973],?
what it considers a good story (cf.
Subsection 2.1),?
how to select the content that represents the story:events, participants, and their relations.However, if narratological discourse parameters are to beapplied, certain story events or participants are required.
Forexample, the narrative levels parameter presupposes theexistence of at least one NARRATING action among the storyevents of the (first) narrative (see Sections 4?6).This means that an entirely data-driven, pipelined processwhere content determination precedes document structuring[Reiter and Dale, 2000:111] will not use the full potential ofa narratologically enhanced document planner.
Rather, thecontent determination module (the Story Generator) shouldbe able to satisfy constraints issued by the documentstructurer.
These constraints might well take the form ofmodification requests after a first output attempt of the StoryGenerator.
Therefore, a hypothesis-driven architecture inwhich the system switches back and forth between contentdetermination and document structuring seems well suitedfor the task at hand (see the double arrow in Figure 3).3.2 Document StructuringIn the envisaged architecture, the document structurerreceives the narrative content representation from the StoryGenerator.
In its simplest form, this input is a sequence ofevents together with their participants.
The structurer sharesa domain model with the Story Generator, where thesemantics of events and participants are represented.Determine content(story) andpart of structure(esp.
causality)Story Generatorof given genreGoal: Write coherent narrativeNLGNarratological structurerMicroplannerSurface realizerDocument plan(Abstract) text specificationSurface textVary (order, person,point of view,...);representationcreate discoursesentationAbstractcontentrepre?MicroplannerSurface realizer(Abstract) text specificationNarrative streamSurface textperson, focalization, speech reproductionDetermine content (story), decide aboutof genre: fairy taleStoryBookHypothetical SGImplicit goal: Write coherent narrativeBy default, the incoming event sequence is considered ascorresponding to a discourse related by the NarrativeSe-quence discourse relation1 (for discourse relations, cf.
Sub-section 6.3).
The sequence might have additional internalstructure, because most Story Generators represent conse-quences of events and/or episodes, and therefore some kindof causality [e.g.
Gerv?s et al, 2004; P?rez y P?rez andSharples, 2004; Turner, 1994].Combining this information with information from theontology and with narratological knowledge, the narra-tological document structurer creates variation in discourse.Most narrative parameters presented in Table 1 influence onthis representational domain.
Amongst others, the Narra-tological Structurer can perform the following tasks, someof them in interaction with the Story Generator:?
modify the order of events or episodes, tag the shiftedelements as flashbacks or flashforwards, and accord-ingly modify the discourse relations (a Cause relationmight become an Explanation relation because of theinverted event order);?
create ellipsis by suppressing events or episodes thatthe reader might as well infer;?
add or remove narrative levels (Sections 4?6);?
decide about point of view and focalization for theentire narrative or, rather, for certain episodes, and ac-cordingly present or suppress events and relations.The produced document plan contains discourse relationsand narratological information for nodes and leaves, whichcan be further used in microplanning and surface realization.3.3 Microplanning and Surface RealizationThe microplanner performs lexicalisation and aggregationand generates referring expressions.
Besides the usualconstraints, it respects narratological contraints.
For exam-ple, certain values of focalization and point of view cancause ?unusual?
referring expressions: personal pronounsmight be used for initial reference [Harweg, 1968: 163?166], or indefinite referring expressions for subsequentreference [Ushie, 1986; Wiebe and Rapaport, 1988].
Thechoice of vocabulary, tense, and syntactic complexity can aswell depend on narratological factors.The surface realizer turns the microplanner output intonatural language text.
See [Callaway and Lester, 2002:224]for narrative-related issues in surface realization.4 The Narrative Levels ParameterThe narrative levels parameter will be used to illustrate thekind of knowledge that can be acquired from narratology forintegration into a narratologically enhanced NLG system.Narratives can consist of different levels: There are ?taleswithin tales within tales?
[Barth, 1984].
Genette [1988:85]illustrates this phenomenon by a figure similar to Figure 4,1 Similar to the relations Narration [Asher and Lascarides,2003:162?165] or Occasion [Hobbs, 1990:86?89].Figure 4: Narrative levelsin which person i produces an utterance a that contains theproduction of another utterance b by person j.
Talking aboutnarratives, the ?persons?
in Genette?s drawing correspond tonarrative instances (narrators).
Narrative instance i mightnot be identified by any referring expression throughout theutterances produced by i (and j): i can be ?absent from thestory?
or heterodiegetic [Genette, 1980:244?245].
Narrativeinstance j, on the other hand, necessarily has to be identicalto a character in story a.
Finally, j might be absent (or not)from the ?inner?
narration b that he himself produces (seeTable 1 on Person).The generation of a narration within a narration presup-poses the existence of a NARRATING action in the ?outer?narration: in Figure 4, a NARRATING action (where j tells b)occurs within outer narration a.2 Therefore, before narrativelevels will be modelled in detail (Section 6), Section 5 willbe concerned with a definition of NARRATING.Genette?s [1980:244] considerations suggest that narra-tive levels is one of the simpler narratological parameters.For example, he claims that any narrative can be convertedinto an inner narration by adding ?presentational?
outer nar-rations [Genette, 1988:95].
It should thus be possible toenable a generation system to create narrativel levels.5 NARRATING and Related FramesThis section proposes representation structures forNARRATING (Subsection 5.1) and related frames, especiallythe NARRATED frame (Subsection 5.2).
A frame is consid-ered to represent structured knowledge about a given con-cept.
In terms of NLG tasks, this modelling corresponds tosetting up part of a domain model for content determination[Reiter and Dale, 2000:86?89].The modelling is supported by concordances from theGerman DWDS corpus.3 Contexts of verb forms of erz?hlen(?tell; narrate?)
were investigated, because they ?evoke?
thetarget frame NARRATING.
As DWDS texts are of severaltypes, the results reflect general (not only literary) languageuse.
The analysed corpus material stems from texts pub-lished between 1990 and 1999.
The modelling is also partlyinspired by the SUMO4 upper ontology [Niles and Pease,2001].
SUMO does not yet include the NARRATING concept.5.1 The NARRATING FrameThe NARRATING frame is an indirect subframe of ACTION.Narratological theories [Chatman, 1978:44?45] agree with2 ?Inside?
vs. ?outside?
narrations [Barth, 1984:233] are alsocalled ?framed?
vs. ?framing?
or ?embedded?
vs. ?embedding?.3 http://www.dwds.de [Query date: 24 January, 2005].4 http://ontology.teknowledge.com/ [10 March, 2005].ijabcurrent ontologies like SUMO on the fact that an action isperformed intentionally by a cognitive agent.
The NARRAT-ING frame thus inherits an Agent slot which I relabelNarrativeInstance for better orientation (cf.
Table 5).The NARRATING frame is related to other frames sub-sumed under the superframe COMMUNICATION_ACTION.That superframe represents an action in which typically atleast two participants exchange messages.
In the presentinvestigation, NARRATING actions are assumed to expressthis content linguistically; therefore, NARRATING is here alsoa subframe of LINGUISTIC_COMMUNICATION (cf.
Figure 5).In the NARRATING frame, the content is represented ascomplex filler of the Narrated slot; a more detailedmodelling of the NARRATED frame follows in Subsection5.2.
NARRATING is a special subframe of COMMUNICA-TION_ACTION insofar as it usually restricts the direction ofthe information flow between the participants: One of themis the (main) producer, the other one the (main) recipient ofNARRATED.
The respective participant slots are the abovementioned NarrativeInstance, and the Addressee.
Typical-ly, the Addressee or ?narratee?
[Genette, 1980] is a cogni-tive agent different from NarrativeInstance.
Nevertheless,the current model also allows the same individual to actsimultaneously as both NarrativeInstance and Addressee:cognitive agents may ?tell a story to themselves?.Comments and questions produced by the Addressee,concerning the Narrated, deserve some attention.
The pre-sent conceptualization considers that even if comments andquestions interrupt of the flow of Narrated, they do notnecessarily mark the end of a NARRATING action (see alsoSubsection 5.2).Some other slots of NARRATING are inherited from theACTION or EVENT frames.
In the DWDS corpus material (cf.Table 2, Appendix), examples of fillers of Motivation,Consequence/Aim, ParallelEvent, Time, Place, and Man-ner are encountered.
Typically, one of the Consequences ofNARRATING is a change of the Addressee?s mental state: theNarrated is added to her or his knowledge.
This conse-quence seems to belong to the lexico-semantic knowledgeabout NARRATING or, probably, COMMUNICATION_ACTIONSin general, and is rarely mentioned explicitly in texts.Table 3 gives an overview of the NARRATING frame.
Italso maps slot names on binary relation labels and formu-lates restrictions for the fillers.
However, as a representationof a conceptual entity, it does not specify linguistic restric-tions such as ?addressee-oriented, non-message-oriented?which are considered to hold language-specifically for indi-vidual verbs [Bateman et al, 1994].
For the use in a specificNLG system, the frame and its slots thus need to be mappedonto the lexicon used by that system during lexicalisation.5.2 The NARRATED FrameA text can refer to different aspects of what is narrated in aNARRATING action.
Hence, instead of introducing furtherslots within the NARRATING frame, the filler of Narratedwill itself be represented as a frame (cf.
Table 4, Appendix).One way of referring to the NARRATED_LINGUISTIC_MES-SAGE, abbreviated as NARRATED, is to mention the Text-Figure 5: Frame hierarchy containing NARRATINGNARRATINGSlot Relation Filler RestrictionNarrativeInstance isCausedBy CognitiveAgent (> 0)Narrated produces Narrated (1)Addressee isAddressedTo CognitiveAgent (>= 0)Motivation isMotivatedBy AbstractEntity (>= 0)Consequence/Aim causes Event (> 0)ParallelEvent overlapsWith Event (>= 0)Time happensAtTime TimePosition (> 0)Place locatedAt PhysicalEntity (> 0)Manner is Attribute (>= 0)Table 3: The NARRATING frameType of the narrated material.
Typically, this is a literarygenre, or one of its parts.
Further, the NARRATED uses aMessageSupport, which might be written (e.g.
book, let-ter), spoken (e.g.
speech, song) or thought (e.g.
dream).Thought seems to lend itself to somewhat problematic sub-divisions; see e.g.
[Genette, 1980:231] on ?retrospections?.The abstract content of NARRATED is represented linguis-tically through a LinguisticSurfaceForm.
As can be seenfrom the DWDS corpus, the LinguisticSurfaceForm oc-curs as a new sentence or clause, and can be more or less?direct?.
Research on the reproduction of speech is an areaof both narratology and linguistics.
Usually, the forms directspeech (D in Table 4), free indirect speech and indirectspeech (I in Table 4) are distinguished in increasing order ofnarrative distance (see Table 1) [Fludernik, 2005].Comments and questions produced by the Addressee of aNARRATING action, concerning the Narrated, should also bepart of the LinguisticSurfaceForm: Metaphorically speak-ing, they might be seen as discursive catalysts or parasites ofthat surface form.Finally, the Topic slot of the NARRATED frame is typical-ly filled by sentence constituents like objects or preposi-tional phrases.
Since these constituents can themselves becomplex, the topic might be quite detailed, taking the formof a summary.
Still, it does not provide access to the?original?
linguistic surface form.
With respect to narrative,this category is also referred to as narrative report ofdiscourse or content summary [Fludernik, 2005].Figure 6 illustrates the knowledge modelled byNARRATED and related frames.HappeningEvent (Process)Action...
...Experiencing...CommunicationAction ......LinguisticCommunicationDirectingCommittingNarratingReporting ...produces(LinguisticMessage)produces(NarratedLinguisticMessage)Figure 6: The NARRATED_LINGUISTIC_MESSAGE frameAt a meta-level, the NARRATED frame can be mappedonto representation structures of the envisaged system thatcombines SG and NLG (cf.
Figure 3 above).
The TextTypeis implicitly given in the goal of the Story Generator; alsothe Topic or a topic restriction is often given at this stage.The Support is, depending on the stage of processing, somedigital entity, written (printed), or possibly speech.
The Ab-stractContent is the ?abstract?
output of a Story Generator(the product of content determination).
The LinguisticSur-faceForm corresponds to the final NLG output based onthis abstract content.
Using knowledge and reasoning proce-dures, a system might additionally or alternatively summa-rise AbstractContent into a phrase that represents Topic.6 Representing Narrative LevelsThis section is concerned with describing a formalism thatshould enable a discourse planner to handle narrative levels(see Section 4).
Via the formalism, the system can be told?
how many levels a generated narrative should have,?
which narrative instance should be the ?direct?mediator to the reader, and?
how outer and inner narrations, or parts thereof,should follow each other in discourse.The basic ingredients for the formalism (Subsection 6.1)are applied to a description of example constellations (Sub-section 6.2) and mapped onto discourse relations (Subsec-tion 6.3).
Subsection 6.4 briefly exemplifies the cooperationbetween Story Generator and Narratological Structurer.6.1 Basic Ingredients: Classes and RelationsThree classes and two relations need to be modelled torepresent possible structures of global narratives withrespect to their levels.NARRATIONAn instance of NARRATED is a NARRATION if its Linguistic-SurfaceForm is of the subtype DirectLinguisticSurface-Form (and is, as such, explicitly present in the output text).This narratological constraint correctly excludes fromopening a new narrative level such NARRATING actionswhich are merely mentioned, or whose NARRATED isreproduced indirectly.NARRATIVE_INSTANCEA NARRATIVE_INSTANCE is a cognitive agent that occupiesthe agent role (NarrativeInstance slot) of a NARRATINGaction.
Neither the instance itself nor the action needs to bereferred to directly in the surface form of any NARRATION.For example, if i isA NARRATIVE_INSTANCE, the variablei is not necessarily ?resolved?
against a character name.toldBy(NARRATION, NARRATIVE_INSTANCE)The relation toldBy(a,i) holds if there is a NARRATING actionx, a NARRATION a and a NARRATIVE_INSTANCE i such thatboth isCausedBy(x,i) and produces(x,a) are true (Table 3).toldIn(NARRATION, NARRATION)ToldIn(b,a) or ?b is told in a?
holds if there is a NARRATIONb, a NARRATION a, and a NARRATING action x such that:?
a is not b;?
a is an event sequence such that one of its events is x;?
produces(x,b).DISCOURSE_SEQUENCEA DISCOURSE_SEQUENCE is an ordered list of variablesstanding for different NARRATIONS, as they sequentially oc-cur within the discourse of a global narrative.
In a DIS-COURSE_SEQUENCE, the same variable may appear morethan once: for example, an outer narration can frame aninner narration at the start and the end of a discourse.Variables for separated parts of the same narration receivenumbered subscripts (see a1 and a2 in Figure 7 below).6.2 Example ConstellationsType 0: Zero-InstantiationZero instantiation of the narrative levels parameter occurs ifthere is no change in level.
There is only one narration, toldby a narrative instance.
An example of this type is the fableThe Fox and the Crow by Aesop, because neither the foxnor the crow produce any narrations.
The instantiation of theclasses and relations corresponds to the scenario in Table 5.I am not aware of any Story Generator (cf.
Section 2) thatexceeds the zero instantiation.
This would mean that con-temporary Story Generators ignore narrative levels.Type 1: Outer and one Inner NarrationA typical pattern of Type 1 is as follows: An outer narrationcontains a NARRATING action whose agent is a narrativeinstance different from that of the outer narration.
The NAR-RATED of this action is the inner narration.
After the NAR-RATING action, the rest of the outer narration is told (Table 6).An example is Heart of Darkness (1902) by JosephConrad.
A homodiegetic narrative instance i (= ?I?)
tellsouter narration a, while j (= ?Marlow?)
tells inner b:Figure 7: Narrative levels and discourse sequenceuses MessageSupportisOfTextType TextTypehasForm LinguisticSurfaceFormisAbout TopicRelation Filler RestrictionLinguisticSurfaceFormMsgSupportIndirectLSFFreeIndirectLSFDirectLSFWritten ThoughtSpokenNarratedLinguisticMessagerepresents(AbstractContent)ijabba1a2Classes and Relations InstantiationNarration aNarrativeInstance iAttribution of NarrativeInstance toldBy(a,i)Attribution of Narration --Sequence discourse_sequence=[a]Table 5: Zero-Instantiation of Narrative LevelsClasses and Relations InstantiationNarration a,bNarrativeInstance i,jAttribution of NarrativeInstance toldBy(a,i), toldBy(b,j)Attribution of Narration toldIn(b,a)Sequence discourse_sequence=[a1,b,a2]Table 6: One Inner Narration; Framing Outer Narration[a1 toldBy i] ?

?5The ?implicit inquit?
phrase he began [...] is a commentby i concerning the Manner of NARRATING.
It is not mod-elled in the discourse_sequence (see also Subsections 5.1?5.2 on comments).
?
The closing part of outer narrative a inHeart of Darkness is very short (cf.
Figure 8, Appendix).Type 1 has some variants.
For instance, an outer narrationmight not be resumed at the end of the discourse (Table 7,Appendix), as in Abb?
Pr?vost?s Manon Lescaut (1731).
Incontrast, an outer narration (here: b) might manifest itself indiscourse only after the NARRATED (here: a) produced in theNARRATING action it contains (Table 8, Appendix).
PhilipRoth?s novel Portnoy's Complaint (1969) shows this pattern.Yet another variant occurs when the narrative instances ofouter and inner narration are identical (Table 9, Appendix).An example is Balzac?s Sarrasine (1831), where a homo-diegetic narrator (i) tells a first narration (a) to an ?un-known?
addressee (the ?reader?).
In the course of a, a NAR-RATING action is performed by i himself, but with a differentaddressee, namely a character in a (cf.
Figure 9, Appendix).Other Types: More Than Two NarrationsMore than two NARRATIONS can easily be combinedextending the patterns presented above.Common ?outward?
extensions of levels include explicitintroductory or closing NARRATING actions, often producedon written support by (fictional) editors, translators or?discoverers?
of the inner narration.
An example is the5 http://www.online-literature.com/conrad/heart_of_darkness/[10 March, 2005].novel Der goldne Spiegel (?The golden mirror?, 1772) byChristoph Martin Wieland, for which a structure with threeopening narrations ?leading to?
the innermost narration d,has been identified6 (cf.
Table 10, Appendix).At least equally common are ?inward?
extensions of thelevels.
While several NARRATING actions within one and thesame outer narration are considered to produce parallelinner narrations at the same level, further levels are addedwhen a narration is produced within an inner narration.
InThe 1001 Nights, Scheherazade entertains King Shahryarwith parallel inner narrations.
In these narrations, the char-acters sometimes tell one another stories, which are innernarrations at the next level.
Table 11 (Appendix) shows asimplified version of The 1001 Nights, in which Sche-herazade (j) tells only three stories (b,c,d).
The third level isadded by narration e, told by a character (k) of narration d.6.3 Discourse GraphsThe basic assumption underlying discourse graphs is thatdiscourse relations (e.g.
[Mann and Thompson, 1988;Hobbs, 1990:83?111; Asher and Lascarides, 2003]) existbetween discourse segments, where a segment is either aproposition or a graph consisting of already related proposi-tions.
Most theories assume that a limited set of discourserelations covers all semantic links that might exist betweendiscourse segments.Based on the status of segments they relate, multinuclearand nucleus-satellite discourse relations can be distin-guished.
The definition of nuclearity by Mann and Thomp-son [1988:266] is centered around the notions of compre-hensibility (a text is less understandable if a nucleus isdeleted), substitutability (satellites can more easily bereplaced) and writer's purpose (nuclei are more essential).Similarly, Hobbs [1990:104] subdivides discourse relationsinto coordinating and subordinating.There are correspondences to narratological theory (e.g.
[Barthes, 1966; Pavel, 1985; Chatman, 1978]).
Chatmansubdivides events, as constituting elements of story, intokernels and satellites.
Kernels cannot be deleted withoutdisturbing the logic of the plot.
Satellites contribute first ofall aesthetically, so that their deletion is logically possible.A difference lies in the size of the analysed segments.Linguistically inspired theories include propositions(clauses) as basic level, but descriptions using these theoriesoften stop at the level of one or several paragraphs (an ex-ception is [Longacre, 2003]).
Narratological analyses usu-ally concentrate on larger segments, represented by para-phrases of their propositions [Chatman, 1978:54].Discourse Graphs for Type 1 Narrative LevelsTo a certain degree, the narratological description of narra-tive levels constrains which relations might hold betweennarrations of a ?levelled?
global narrative.
Still, it does notcompletely disambiguate the global discourse structure.In fact, in a typical Type 1 narrative (Table 6), the innernarration b might be related in two competing ways to nar-6 By J?rg Sch?nert in FGN Forum Narratologie(http://www.narrport.uni-hamburg.de/) on 21 December, 2004.ration a.
The first analysis relates a and b based on a local,lexical consideration: a NARRATION is regarded as an argu-ment of the verb phrase that evokes NARRATING.
This isillustrated by Example (1).
If NARRATED TextType filler(e.g.
?a story?)
is present in a sentence, the English verb tellallows an implicit LinguisticSurfaceRealization (1a).
This?
initially underspecified ?
argument of tell might then berealized in a subsequent sentence (1b), so that an Elabora-tion relation holds between (1a) and (1b).
In nucleus-satel-lite terms, (1a) is a nucleus elaborated by (1b).
(1) a.
[a toldBy i] John told a story to Mary.
b.
?
[btoldBy j] I was seventeen years old, and [...].
?The proposed analysis is in line with Asher andLascarides [2003:285], who identify an Elaboration relationbetween the propositions (2a) and (2b) of Example (2).
(2) a. John made a promise to Mary.
b.
He wouldphone her.The possibility that the resulting discourse graph (Figure10) indeed holds for a global narrative increases if theNarrativeSequence representing narration b is relativelyshort.
This also confirms that in these cases, the DirectLin-guisticSurfaceRepresentation of the content of b is anaesthetical choice rather than a ?plot-logical?
necessity.The presented analysis based on local features does notalways seem globally appropriate as well.
Outer narrationsoften set the background for a (longer) inner narration at thestart of the discourse_sequence, and draw conclusions,interpret or evaluate it at the end.
Figure 11 shows thecorresponding graph, in which the segment representingnarration b is nucleus of two relations.7 This corresponds toa ?schema?
identified by Mann and Thompson [1988:247].Danlos [2004:130] presents similar double-nuclear struc-tures (?factorized?
nuclei) at the sentence level.Both presented graphs are plausible.
The final choice fora given global narrative depends not on narratological dis-course description alone, but on story contents as well.6.4 Processing ExamplesThis subsection briefly sketches two examples of how theStory Generator and the Narratological Structurer (cf.
Fig-ure 3) could cooperate during the creation of typical Type 1narrative levels (cf.
Subsection 6.2).Adding an Outer NarrationThe Story Generator creates Story A. Respecting the condi-tions for a Type 1 narrative, the Narratological Structurerrequests an additional Story B, with some restrictions:?
B is shorter than A;?
B contains a NARRATING event.The Story Generator generates Story B.
This might be aminimal story consisting of the events MEETING (of char-acters c1 and c2), NARRATING (of a story by c1), REACTION(of c2).
Upon receipt of B, the Narratological Structurer fills7 At a global level, the Background relation can be comparedonly in a very abstract way to the definitions given by Asher andLascarides [2003:165?168] or Mann and Thompson [1988:273].Figure 10: Discourse Graph 1 for Type 1, Framing Outer NarrationFigure 11: Discourse Graph 2 for Type 1, Framing Outer NarrationStory A into the Narrated slot of the NARRATING event inB, tags it as direct speech for the subsequent processingmodules, and arranges all contents into a discourse treecorresponding to Figure 11.
Story A has become an innernarration and a nucleus, Story B is the outer narration.Adding an Inner NarrationThe Story Generator creates Story A which contains aNARRATING event.
The Narratological Structurer requests anadditional Story B, with the following restrictions:?
B is shorter than A;?
the contents of B illustrate a part of A, for example anevent present in A, or a character trait of the Narra-tiveInstance of the NARRATING event.The Story Generator generates Story B.
For instance, theillustration of A might be achieved by similarity: if Story Acontains a CRIME event (e.g.
KIDNAPPING), Story B can con-tain a CRIME event as well (e.g.
ROBBERY).
The Narratologi-cal Structurer now fills the new Story B into the Narratedslot of the NARRATING event in A, tags it as direct speech,and arranges all contents into a discourse tree, this timecorresponding to Figure 10.
Story A has become an outernarration, Story B is the inner narration and a satellite.7 Conclusions and Future WorkThe proposed system architecture combines Story Genera-tion, narratological structuring and traditional NLG compo-nents into an advanced NLG system for the production ofnarratives.
Starting with the narrative levels parameter, do-main modelling and meta-knowledge modelling for theNarratological Structurer were exemplified.
Future workwill include comments by narrators, some of which can becompared to ?global level?
discourse markers.Further narratological parameters will be modelled, andconstraints will be formulated for their accumulation.
Acognitive approach might work out their aesthetical effects.a1NarrativeSequencea2NarrativeSequenceElaboration[31]John told:[1?30] [33][32] [34]"Outer Narration" aNarrativeSequenceNarrativeSequence"Inner Narration" bSatelliteNucleus[35?40]a1NarrativeSequence[1?3]a2NarrativeSequence[13?15]Background Interpretation/Evaluation/...NarrativeSequence"Outer Narration" aNarrativeSequence"Inner Narration" bSatelliteSatellite Nucleus Nucleus[4?12]For example, certain receptional states or strategies could beidentified as ?prototypically?
activated, enabled, or blockedby a given combination of narratological parameter instan-tiations.
Finally, content-related studies will lead to concreteproposals for the interaction between a Narratological Struc-turer and one of the existing Story Generators.AcknowledgmentsThis research is supported by DFG (German ResearchFoundation) grant ME 1546/2-1.

A Computational Theory of Perspective andReference in Narrative.
In Proceedings of the 26thAnnual Meeting of the Association for ComputationalLinguistics, pages 131?138, Buffalo, NY, June 1988.A AppendixParameter ExplanationTime: Order Sequence in which events are told, in comparison with the sequence in which they ?actually happened?.
Insynchrony, the event sequence in discourse corresponds to the sequence of the story.
Anachronies can take theform of flashbacks (retrospectives) or flashforwards (anticipations).Time: Speed Relation between story time and discourse time.
Congruence exists probably only in single scenes; otherwisetimelapses (accelerations), time jumps (ellipsis), time expansions (decelerations), or pauses are used to achievedifferent degrees of expliciteness and emphasis.Time: Frequence Relation between the number of times a (similar) event happened, and the number of times an event is told.
Thefollowing realizations are distinguished: singulative (one-to-one relation), repetitive (?recount several times whathappened once?
), and iterative (?recount once what happened several times?
).Mood: Distance Combination of amount of information conveyed and narrator intrusion.
Stereotypically, detailed information andlow narrator participation indicate imitation or ?direct?
dramatic mode, as opposed to a ?distant?, mediatednarrative mode.
This parameter also affects the way in which speech is reproduced.Mood: Focalisation Accessibility of knowledge needed to select story events for presentation in discourse.
If a narrative instancedisposes of unrestricted knowledge of the story world, it uses external focalization; if the knowledge is restricted toa character's field of perception, focalization is internal.Mood:Point of viewSpatial, temporal, and ideological points of view from which events are described.
Events can be described fromthe point of view of different characters.
This parameter covers more aspects than focalization.Voice:Time of narrationTime relation of the narrating action to the story event.
Events can be told while they are happening (concurrently),retrospectively, or prospectively.Voice: Person Narrator participation.
A homodiegetic narrative instance is a character of the current narration (grammaticalrealization typically in the first person), while a heterodiegetic narrative instance is ?absent?
from the currentnarrative and not referred to.
In a second-person narrative, the protagonist is the reader.Table 1: Selected Narratological Parameters in Discourse DomainNARRATINGdas gro?e brasilianische M?dchen ?the tallBrasilian girl?ein Beobachter ?an observer?NarrativeInstancemetonymiceine Legende ?a legend?die Briefe ?the letters?die Orte ?the locations?Addressee jedem, der mich danach fragt ?everyone whoasks me about it?den Eltern ?to the parents?Motivation Die Impulse, aus denen heraus [erz?hlt wird],sind unterschiedlich ?The impulses whysomething [is told] are different?Consequence/Aim[Ich erz?hle dir das] deshalb, damit du heuteschon wei?t, da?
