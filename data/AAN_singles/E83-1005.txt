Rodolfo DelmonteCentro Linguisf ico In ter faco l~UniversirA degli  Studi di VeneziaCa' Ga.rzoni-Moro - S. Marco 3417ABSTRACTA computer program for the automatic translation of anytext of Italian into naturally fluent synthetic speech is pre-sented.
The program, or Phonological Processor (hence FP) mapsinto prosodic structures the phonological rules of Italian.Structural information is provided by such hierarchical pros-odic constituents as Syllable (S), Metrical Foot (HF), Phono-logical Word (PW), Intonational Group (IG).
Onto these struc-tures, phonological rules are applied such as the " letter-to-sound" rules, automatic word stress rules,internal stress hier-archy rules indicating secondary stress,external sandhi rules,phonological focus assignment rules, logical focus assignmentrules.
The FP constitutes also a model to simulate the readingprocess aloud, and the psycholinguistics and cognitive aspectsrelated wil l  be discussed in the computational model of the FP.At present, Logical Focus assignment rules and the computation-al model are work in progress s t i l l  to be implemented in theFP.
Recorded samples of automatically produced syntheticspeech will  be presented at the conference to i11ustrate thefunctioning of the rules.O.
IntroductionThe FP which we shall describe in detail in the followingpages, is the terminal section of a system of speech synthesisby rule without vocabulary restrictions, implemented at theCentre of Computational Sonology of the University of Padua.From the linguistic point of view the FP is a model to simu-late the operations carried out by an Italian speaker whenreading aloud any text.
To this end, the speaker shall use therules of his internal grammar to translate graphic signs intonatural speech.
These rules wi11 have to be implemented in theFP, together with a computational mechanism simulating thepsychological end cognitive functions of the reading process.I.
The Phonologlcal RulesAt the phonological level the FP has to account for lowlevel or segmental phenomena, and high level or suprasegmentalones.
The former are represented by three levels of structure,that is S, MF, PW and are governed by phonological rules whichare meant to render the movements of the vocal tract and thecoarticulatory effects which occur regularly at word level andat word boundaries.
The latter are represented by one level ofstructure, the IG, and are governed by rules which account forlong range phenomena like pitch contour formation, intonationcentre assignment, pauses.
In brief, the rules that the FPshall have to apply are the following:i .
transcription from grapheme to nphoneme", including themost regular coarticulatory and allophonic phenomena of theIt~dian language;ii.
automatic word stress assignment, including all the mostfrequent exceptions to the rules as well as individuationof homographs, which are very common in Italian;i i i .
internal word stress hierarchy, with secondary stres/esassignment, individuation of unstressed dipththongs, triph-thongs, hiatuses;iv.
external sandhi rules, operating at word boundaries and re-sulting in stress retraction, destressing, stress hierarchymodification, elision by assimilation and other phenomena;v. destressing of functional words listed in a table lookup;vi.
pauses marked off by punctuation; pauses deriving from acount of PWs; pauses deriving from syntactic structuralphenomena; comma intonation marking of parentheticals andsimilar structures;v i i .
rules to restructure the IG when too long - more than ?PWs, or too short - less than 5 PWs;v i i i .
Focus Assignment Rules or FAR, which at f i rs t  mark Phono-logical Focus, or intonation centre dependent on lexicaland phonologically determined phenomena;ix.
FAR which mark Logical Focus or intonation centre depend-ent on structurally determined phenomena.From a general computational point of view,the FP operates bot-tom-up to apply low level rules, analysing each word at a timeuntil the PW structure is reached; i t  operates top-down to ap-ply high level rules and to build the higher structure, the IG.2.
The Phonematic TranscriptionAs far as phonematic transcription of Italian texts isconcerned, there seems to be no such di f f icult ies as for En-glish.
In fact "letter-to-sound" rules are only a few andquite straightforward to be described.
There are a number ofexceptions and counterexceptions to the rules which have to bespecified, but no dictionary lookup seems to be needed.
Whatcreates the main di f f icult ies are digraphs and trigrapbs whichare ambiguous in that they can render both stops and palatals;some of the decisions concerning trigraphs must be taken afterstress has been assigned by word stress rules.
The followinggraphemes have been transcribed into symbols denoting "phonet-ic elements":K = CH, C+A,+O,+U KK = CCH, CC+A,+Os+U - -~ /k /% = CI, rE, CI.Vowel %% = CCI, CCE, COl+Vowel ---> It~lJ = GI, GE, GI?Vowel JJ = GGI, GGE, GGI+Vowel ---> /03// = SCI,SCE,SCI+Vowel ---> /S/< = GLI,GLE,GLI+Vowel ---> /~/> = GN+Vowel ---> /3~/X = Voiced S XX = Geminate S ---> /z/& = Voiced Z && = Geminate Z ---> /dz/26And here are some exceptions:GLICINE, ANGLIA, GEROGLIFICO where GL = /gl/  not //./FARMACIA, LUCIA where Cl : I t I i l  not It~lBUGIA, AEROFAGIA, NOSTALGIA whore GI = /d~i/ not /d3/SCIA where SCI = /$i/ not /S/Here below we include the flowchart of the phonological rulesfor the transcription of graphemes S and Z which, as we said,have both voiced/unvoiced phonemes.
As i t  can be easily seen,the two graphemes have been treated together by the same setof rule operating conjunctively: thus a remarkable economy andsimplicity has resulted; as to the theoretical import of usingone and thesame algorithm, i t  has been shown that voiced S/Zdecisions obey to similar underlying phonological rules.3.
Word Stress RulesIt is our opinion 'that Italian speakers do not use directlymorpho-syntactic information to assign word stress, but anordered set of phonological rules to lexical items completelyspecified in a lexicon, together with some morphologicalinformation - relatively only to a subclass of word types;syntactic category information is limited to the verb class.In other words, Italian is not a free-stress language, asdiffusedIy discussed in Delmonte (1981).
Speakers analysefu l ly  specifies lexical items by blocks of word stress rulesordered sequentially, which address dif ferent types of wordsaccording to syllable structure.
Words are made to enter eachrule block disjunctively, that is each word either enters ablock and receives stress, or is passed on to the next block.Exceptions are processed f i r s t .
No word can be sent back to?
~Ssteps of the algorithm already passed, that is there.nobacktracking.
The FP divides al l  words into two main classes:lexical words or open class words, and functional words orclosed class words, the latter  ones are dealt with by a tablelookup and destressed.
Lexical words are made to enter intoblocks of rules according to the following criteria:i .
verbs are labelled f i r s t  by means of a table lookup made upof 1500 most frequent Ital ian verbs extracted from the LIF;i io BLOCK I deals with words with graphic stress on the lastsyllable as "carit~", with truncated words - Italian wordswith consonant ending and foreign words; with monosyllabicwords which can receive word stress l ike nso" a verb, orbe treated as functional words l ike "1o n, an art ic le;i i i .
BLOCK I I  deals with bisyl labic words and applies to a l lwords the f i r s t  general word stress rule which states thati f  a word has an heavy syllable in penultimate position i treceives stress on that syllable;Izli"NO "'?

BLOCK V with further subroutines, deals with words eitherending with a sy l lable containing more than one vowel, orwith more than one vowel in penultimate syl lable - biphone-matic, trtphonematic or ~etraphonematic vowel groups may re-sult  in diphthong, tr iphthong, or hiatuses l ike  "bugia",?
acciaio n, "a iuo le" .Word stress rules l ike  Rule I take into account a series ofphonotactic conditions as well as the syntactic category ofverb which is essential  to the treatment of homographs and toword stress assignment.
In fact ,  I ta l ian  is a language veryrich in homographs such as "'ambito - am'bito n, " 'apr i le  -a 'p r i le "  and so on.
Usually, by varying the posit ion of stressalso the syntactic category w i l l  vary.
Such words are includ-ed in a table lookup and syntactic category is decided accord-ing to contextual information.
Another class of homographs, be-longing this time to the one and same syntactic category, ismade up by such words as " r i ' cordat i  - r i cor 'dat i  n, " im'piccia-t i  - imp i ' cc ia t i " ,  which are treated also according to context-, \[ ai .

I f  they come in f i r s t  posit ion or af ter  a pause, i t  isassumed that they are c l i t i c i zed  imperatives and stress is as-signed to the antepenultimate sy l lab le ;  i f  they do not havethat posit ion in the utterance and an unstressed word precedesthem,they are treated as past part ic ip les  and stress is assign.ed to the penultimate sy l lable (See Fig.2).4.
Internal Word Stress HierarchyThese rules take mainly decisions about secondary stress as-signment and also about an adequate def in i t ion  of a l l  unstress.ed syl lables preceding and fol lowing the stressed one.
To as-sign secondary stress the FP builds up the MP structure.
Thisis done by counting the number of syl lables preceding thestressed one.
The rule states that the FP has to alternate oneunstressed syl lable before each primary or secondary stressedFIG 2 .

Restructuring may result in words with three or more thanthree syllables before the primary stressed one, as in:" f~ l i c i ' ta"  "aut~ntic i ' ta" "a r t i f i c ia l i ' ta"  "fot6gra'fare""ctnem~to'grafico" matem~tica'mente" "rappres~ntativa'mente""ut i l l tar\]st ica'mente" "preclpitevollssimevol'mente"According to the number of syllables, two unstressed syllablesmay precede or follow the secondary stressed one.
The Restruct-uring Rule for the.
MF takes into account performance factswhich require that the number of secondary stressed syllablescannot be more than two when speaking at normal rate, but alsothat no more than three unstressed syllables may alternatestressed ones.
To produce particular emphasis, i .e .
i f  theword constitutes in i t se l f  an utterance, there may be obvious-ly an increase to three secondary stresses in the same word oreven to four as in "precipit~vol\]ssim~vol'mente'.
This factwi l l  slow down the speaking rate at values - number of syl la-bles per second - which is under the norm, only to suit thespeaker's aim to produce emphasis.5.
External Sandhi RulesUp to this point, low level rules have built PW by stressing some words and destressing some other words which havebecome proclitics and are joined to the f i rst  stressed word ontheir right to build a PW as in "della nostra parte" (on ourside).
High level rules localize punctuation pauses and startto apply external sandhi rules, which may elide a vowel, as in"la famigli~ ~gnelli", " i i  mar~ ~ molto agitato" (RULE I I ) ;  orthey may produce schwa-like vowels as in "hann~nteresse", ~incredibile" (RULE I I I ) ;  retract primary stress as in "'dottorm'Romolo", "'ingegner 'Rossi" (RULE IVa/b).
In the latter case,stress rules have to move back primary stress and to unstressthe remaining syllables.
It is essential to apply these rulesin this phase, because intonation centre may only be assignedto primary stressed syllables: exceptions are representedeither by auxillaries which can assume the role of lexicalverbs as in "oggi non ci sono" (today I'm not there), nho chie?sto ma non ce l'hanno" (I asked but they haven't got i t ) ;  orby cl it ics and adjectives which can become pronouns as in "nonci vengo con re" (I don't come with you), "preferisco quella"(I prefer that one).I_ stress 1V ~@/- -~ \ [+\ ]  ~RULE I f ,I - high l ho~ophonJ--+ \ [a \ ]  / ..... ~ \ [+\ ]I - stress \] 1 ..l_homophon .V+h~ophonV- s t ress  1 ~ h~ophonJ2__ stress l - -  h epho?

IG Construal RulesAt this point the FP shall have to be provided of rules whichtransform one or more PWs joining them into an IG as well asof rules which assign the intonation centre of the utterance.The two operations are dependent on Rule of IG construal andon Focus Assignment Rules or FAR.
IG Construal Rules shouldintu i t ive ly  build well formed IGs.
General well-formedness con-ditions could be established so that phonological facts reflec-ting performance l imitations as well as syntactic and semanticphenomena can be adequately taken into account.
These condi-tions are as follows:CONDITIONS A. determined by intr ins ic  characteristics of thefunctioning of memory and of the articulatory apparatus whichimpose restrictions on the length of an IG - length is definedin terms of the number of constituents, i .e.
PWs, to be packedinto an IG; this number could vary with the speaking rate andother performance parameters which are str ict ly related totemporal and spatial limitations of the language faculty;CONOITIONS B. determined by the need to transmit into an IGchunks of conceptual and semantic information concluded in i t -self and related to the rules of the internal grammar.Construal Rules referring to Conditions A. will f i rst  basetheir application on punctuation, assigning main pauses foreach comma, fu11-stop, colon, semi-colon detected in the text.Restructuring may then take place according to the number ofconstituents present in each IG; i f  less than three, the IG istoo small to stand on its own, and i t  will be joined to thepreceding one; i f  more than seven PWs, and the utterance isnot yet ended, two IGs wi11 result according to phrase struc-ture analysed by the grammar component, or provisionally bycontextual information based on syntactic category labels, andon the presence of functional words which are regarded as pro-c l i t i cs  and should be joined to the f i r s t  following PW.To satisfy Condition B. phonological information is insuff i -cient; syntactic and semantic information shall have to be sup-plied to the FP.
The theoretical proposal which,in our opinionwill suit best our performance oriented processor is the lexic-al functional one, diffusedly discussed in Bresnan (1978,1980,1982), Kaplan & Bres.,an (1981), G~;oar (1980, 1982).
The lexic-al functional component is made up by two subcomponents:I. a lexicon, where each entry is completely specified and hasassociated subcategorization features; lexical items subcat-egorize for such universal functions as SUBJECT, OBJECT andso on, and not for constituent structure categories; lexic-al items exert selectional restrictions on a subset oftheir subcategorized functions; the predicate argumentstructure of a lexical item l ists the arguments for whichthere are selectional restrictions.
Each lexical item in-cludes a lexical form which pe!rs arguments with functions,as well as the grammatical function assignment which l iststhe syntactically ;uFcategorized functions.context-free rules to generate syntactlc constituent struc-tures.The combination of the ~wo descriptions will result in a cons-tituent structure and a functional structure which represent29formally the grammatical relations of the utterance analysedin terms of universal functions.
Functional relations interven-ing between predicate argument structure and adjuncts or comp-lements are determined by a theory of control which is an inte-gral part of the lexical functional grammar.
At this point, wecan formulate the followingRULES OF IG CONSTRUAL1.
Constituents moved .by dislocations, clefting, extraposi-ttons, and raising, obligatory form at least one IG (forthe exceptions see Oelmonte, 1983);2.
Starting with the f i r s t  PW of an utterance, join into oneIG al l  PWsuntil you reach:2.1 the Verb, in Wh- questions, and imperatives;2.2 the last element functionally controlled by a VP, i .e .
anargument or a subordinate clause; complements or adjunctsfunctionally controlled by the Subject of the Object;2.3 the last element anaphorically controlled by a supraordin-ated clause where the matrix Subject appears, control isexpressed at functional level by thematic restr ict ions.In this way, pauses wi l l  be assigned to the most adequatesites taking into account both performance and structural res-trictions.7.
Focus Assignment Rules (FAR)We can distinguish between two kinds of FAR, marked and unmark-ed ones.
Unmarked FAR are dependent on phonological and lexic-al information and give rise to Phonological Focus; marked FARare dependent on structural information and give rise to Logic-al Focus (See Gueron, 1980).Phonological information is used to account for utterancessuch as simple declaratives, imperatives, wh- questions, yes/no question, echo questions, where IGs can be bui l t  withoutstructural information and the Nuclear Stress Rule can be madeto apply in a straightforward way.
The Nuclear Stress Rule(see Chomsky & Halle, 1968), can be reformulated as follows:"within an IG reduce to secondary stresses a l l  primarystresses except the one farthest to the right n, as in:2 ?
2 3 3 1(1) Jack studies secondary education.which is derived from an underlying representation where wordstress is assigned by phonological word stress rules,1 1 1 2 2 1(2) Jack studies secondary education.The NSR for English works in the same way for Italian, as in:2 3 1 2 2 3 1(3) NeIia scuola superiore, Ginrgiu non studia a sufficienza.lexical information is required to label verbs, and is passedon to the phonological component in order to assign focus towh- questions and imperatives as in:F(4) Che tipo di libri scrive la persona che hal salutatn ieri?F(5) Smettila di far tutto quel baccano quando leggo un libro.Lexical information is also essential in order to spot logicaloperators which induce emphatic intonation and attract the in-tonation centre of the utterance in their scope, usually sh i f t -ing i t  to the le f t .
These lexical items are words such as NO,MORE, MUCH, ALL, ALSO, ONLY, \[00 etc.
(see Jackendoff, 1972),which modify the semantic import of the utterance and attractthe intonation centre to the f i r s t  PW in their scope; or incase they modify the whole utterance, they move the focus tothe following proposition, as in:F(6) Anche Giorgio racconter~ una bella storia.F(7) Gli studenti hanno fatto multi esami nella sessione estiva.
(8) I1 bandito non ha ucciso i l  pol iz iotto,  ma la persona al leFsue spalle.
F(8a) I1 bandito non ha ucciso i l  poliziottOoA second set of FAR, the marked ones, shall assign Logicalfocus according to structural information.
This time the FPshall have to be supplied by syntactic and functional in for -mation relat ively to those constituents which have been dis-placed and have been moved to the le f t .
This information is de-rived from the augmentation which is worked on the context-freec-structure grammar of the lexical functional component, bymeans of the functional description which serves as an inter-mediary between c-structure and the f-structure.
Long distancephenomena l ike questions, relat ives, c left ing, subject raisingextrapositions and so on are easily spotted by the use of var i -ables which can represent both immediately dominated metavaria-bias - specified as subcategorization features in the lexicon-and bounded domination metavariables, the nodes to which theywi l l  be attached are farther away in the c-structure, and areempty in f-structure representation.
Focus is assigned to theOBJECT argument of the verb as in:F(g) John has some books to read.F(10) I have plans for tonight.F(11) I t  is the cream that I l ike.F(12) Ann I love.Other structures l ike relatives, tough movements, subject ra is -ing behave d i f ferent ly  from English: in Ital ian focus may beassigned phonologically as in: F(13) He visto \[1 vento muovere le foglieoF(1~) E' faci le per Bruno conquistare Maria.F(15) Maria ~ faci le per Bruno da conquistare.
F(16) Elena ha lasciato istruzioni che Giorgio eseguir~o(r)  r(17) A Maria $ piaciuta la proposta chele  ha lasciato Gino.Focus marked (F) is optional and emphatic, but i t  is s t i l l  d i f -ferent from focus marking in the corresponding English utter-ance (see Stockwell, 1972).No provision is made as yet for FAR meant to account for dis-course level phenomena, knowledge of the world variables, co-textual rather than cQntextual variables, which operate beyondand across sentence and utterance boundaries.
At this level,coreference between two constituents shall have to be determin-ed by synonymous items~ and synonymity calls for knowledge ofthe world, text level analysis which is not available in as t r i c t ly  formal system of rules.
Examples to this point is thefollowing: F F(18) \[onight the children have been really nasty, so I scoldedthe bastards.30where focus is assigned to the verb instead of the NP OBJECTf inal  because the latter is epithet of or synonymous with theNP OBJECT of the supraordinated proposition.
We can thus formu-late the following:FOCUS ASSIGNMENT RULES1.
Ouestions1.1 in wh- questions focus is assigned to the Verb;adverbialsand other adjuncts are joined to the Verb and receivefOCUS;1.1.1 according to the functional roles assumed by the argu-ments of the verb, focus can be assigned to the NP ar-gument acting as Agent SUBJECT;1.1.2 if  extrapositions of PP from NP are in act, or a ques-tion word like "perch," is present, focus is assignedto the PP;1.2 in yes/no question and echo questions, assign Focus phono-logically;2.
ImperativesFocus is assigned to the Verb according to predicate argumentstructure; adjuncts are joined to the Verb and receive focus;3.
Oeclaratives3.1 if there are arguments displaced to the left of theSUBJECT, focus will be assigned to the last constituentfarthest to the right by NSR; topicalizations, cleftingand some kinds of extraposition attract focus to the dis-placed argument;).2 i f  there are propositional complements, Focus will be as-signed again by NSR;3.3 parentheticals, appositives, non-restrictive relativeswill be assigned comma intonation;3.4 with multiple embedded structures, focus assignment isconditioned by the presence of a lexical SUBJECT non ana-phorically controlled by the SUBJECT of a supraordinatedproposition; i f  so, more IGs wi l l  be bui l t  and more thanone focus wi l l  result.8.
The Computational MechanismSo far, we have described the rules of which the#P isequipped.
We shall now deal with the psycholinguistic andcognitive aspects of the FP which, as we said at thebeginning, is a model to simulate the process of reading aloudany text.
From the previous description, i t  would seem that aspeaker analyses the utterance proceeding at f i r s t  bottom-up,unti l  a l l  low level rules have been applied to the structureof PW; subsequently, he skould apply high level rules and heshould build up IGs operating top-down.In fact, the two procedures will have to interact atcertain points of the utterance so that both low and highlevel rules wi l l  be applied contemporarily and fluent readingaloud wi l l  result.
Whereas the speaker applies low levelrules each time the graphic boundary of a word is reached, toapply high level rules he wi l l  have to wait for the end of anIG, which could be determined phonologically or by lexicelfunctional information.
Intuitively, as he proceeds in thereading process, the speaker will stress open class words anddestress closed class ones; he will assign the internal stresshierarchy, and at the same time he wi l l  look for the mostadequate sites to assign main pauses; he wi l l  apply externalsandhl rules, modifying, i f  required, the previous internalstress hierarchy; he wi l l  build up pitch contour according tothe intonational typology appropriate to the utterance he isproducing; intonation centre may result shifted to the le f t  i fhe encounters logical operators, or to the end of the utter-ance, provided that i t  is not a complex proposition with embed-ded and subordinate structures in i t .To carry out such an interchange of rule applicationbetween the two levels of analysis of the utterance the FPshall have to jump from one level to the other i f  need be.
I twi l l  then be provided with a window which enables i t  to do alook-ahead in order to acquire two kinds of information: theone related to the presence of blanks, or graphic boundariesbetween words and the other related to the presence of punc-tuation marks.
The window we have devised for the FP enablesi t  to inspect f ive consecutive words, but not to know which ofthese words wi l l  become the head of a PW or a PW i t se l f ,  atleast not before low level rules wi l l  apply.
The function ofthe window is then limited to the individuation of possiblesites for punctuation pauses.
But this is also what a readerwi l l  probably do while reading the text: as a matter of fact,he wi l l  surely want to know how may graphic words are leftbefore the end of the utterance is reached.
Graphic informa-tion provided by the window is v i ta l  then both for low leveland high level rules application.As far as low level rules are concerned, the local bottom-up procedure is well just i f ied since the reader wil l  want toknow f i r s t  i f  the word eods with a graphic stress mark, assign-ing word stress immediately; i f  this is not the case, he wi l lturn to the penultimate syllable, which is the site where I ta-l ian word stress assignment is decided, and he wi l l  carry outsyllable count i f  needed.
Word stress rule wi l l  apply and in-ternal stress hierarchy wi l l  be assigned.The main decision to be taken before high level rules maystart to apply regards pauses.
As we said before, visual infor-mation may guide the reader together with phonological deci-sions previously taken.
But quantitative count of words s t i l lle f t  to process is only the f i r s t  cr i ter ion,  which shall haveto be confirmed by qualitative analysis on a structural level.Structurally assigned pauses shall have to account for subor-dinate, coordinate propositions as well as embedded ones.Whereas comma intonation wi l l  have to be assigned to appositives,parentheticals and non restr ict ive clauses, subordinate propo-sit ions may be assigned Focus.
Graphic information - the pres-ence of one or two commas in the utterance - may thus receivetwo completely dif ferent interpretations: the FP shall have toindividuate subordinate clauses which are usually preceded byadverbials, l inkers or conjuncts such as SE, OUANDO, SEBBENE,PERCHE', BENCHE', etc.
which cause temporary information stor-age and a suspension of RAF application.
Focus goes to the sub-ordinate only i f  i t  comes at the beginning of the utteranceand i t  is not a proposition of the kind of concessives, conse-cutives, conditionals, adversatives which are easily detectedfrom the kind of conjunct introducing them.As far as embedded clauses are concerned, waiting for thelexical functional component o be activated, the FP operatesonly through the individuation of verbs and of complementizersIn particular, the presence of "che" may induce a pause onlyi f  the embedded clause is right-branching.
Completives, l ikein f in i t ives  and indirect questions, as well as restr ict iveclauses do not require a pause unless a lexica\] subject ispresent (See Fig.

Acoustic Parameters and Phonetic 0etailWe said at the beginning that the FP is the terminal sec-tion of a system of synthesis by rule; we also said that theperformance oriented apparatus of phonological rules are meantto simulate the movements of the vocal tract of a speaker read-ing aloud any Italian text.
To bring the FP as close as possi-ble to the linguistic realization process we have undertakenexperimental work in order to detect the characteristics ofnormal intonational and accentual phenomena of the process ofreading aloud.
