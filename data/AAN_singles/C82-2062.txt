By a natura l  secret  language,  sometimesca l led  cant in  Eng l i sh  or  ch i ld ren 's  p lay  language we mean snatura l  language t rans format ion ,  which preserves  importantmorpho- and phono log ica l  qua l i t ies  of  the under ly ing  sourcelanguage.
Such languages seem to make up a r i ch  cu l tu re ,  whichi s  a mixture  of  lo re ,  l i ngu is t i cs ,  c rypto logy ,  and - i f  youwish - of  computing.Today the phenomenon l ies  probably  neares t  to fo lk lo reand ch i ld ren 's  cu l tu re ,  but in  ear l ie r  t imes they have, andperhaps s t i l l  do const i tu te  important  sk i l l s  of  the lower andunderground wor ld .
In  the Middle Ages they were wide ly  usedamong ~ beggars ,  tramps,  ped lars ,  vagabonds, th ieves  e tc .
ToEurope they seem to  have come through the Bysantitun from theEast ,  where they s t i l l  today cont inue  to l i ve  an ac t ive  l i fe .As a l ingu is t i c  phenomenon they seem to be un iversa land appear in  some form and extent  p ract i ca l l y  in  a l l  languag-es and cu l tu res .
Yet i t  seems that  they have a t t rac ted  l i t t lea t tent ion  from the  part  of  l i ngu is t i cs  or  c rypto logy .

As c rypto log ica l  methods the  natura l  secret  l~age- 251  -t rans format ions  are fa i r l y  s imple and the i r  va lue  bare lyextends beyond the ch i ld ren 's  p layground.
Though in teres t ing -l y  enough they seem to we l l  meet f i ve  out of the s ix  so ca l l -ed Kerckhof f ' s  c r i te r ia  o f ten  used to assess  usab i l i ty  ofc ryptograph io  methods and systems.A~Vhow, they  work we l l  and fu l f i l l  the i r  purpose ins i tuat ions  fo r  which they  are aimed fo r :  exchange of  o ra lmessages in  rea l  t ime in  a s i tuat ion ,  where the unintendedare  present, Since the message does not leave permanent trace,it is not possible to examine it afterwards.For linguistic research they can be valuable in thatthey exhibit some phenomena and processes on the morpho- andphonologlcal levels that can serve as a framework for extra-linguistic experimentation,From computing and programming point of view the sub-Ject is of definite 'interest, since it involves nontrIvialmorpho- and phonological recognition, context conditions andt rans format ions ,  which o f fe r  an ins t ruc t ive  excerc i se  inlinguistic progrsmming.Several types of families of secret languages, or rath-er classes of language transformations, are identified.
Thetypology can be categorized as follows:I. Syllabic transformations, which may involve deletions,replications, insertions or substitutions of syllables orphonemic elements under certain contextual conditions.2.
Transformations that involve syllable permutations, possib-ly intermixed with transformations of the above type.3e Types of transformations, which involve nonsyllabic splitt-ing of words in to  segments that  ere  in terchanged wi thsegments of  a g iven  key word or  wi th those of  the  nextword.F ina l ly  some hybr id  types  occur ,  which combine featuresof  var ious  types  in  one language.- 252 -QAs an example a deta i led  ana lys i s  i s  g iven  of the Kont t ilanguage,  which i s  wide ly  known in  F in land and  belongs to  theth i rd  category .
In  Kont t i  the sp l i t  po int  i s  determined by anumber of  ru les ,  ~hich are cond i t ioned  by some metr i c  andprosod ic  features  together  w i th  the vowel consonant s t ruc tureo f  the two words.
The t rans format ions  invo lve  both durat iona land harmonic accommodations to p reserve  the  metr i c  qua l i t iesand to  meet the vowel harmony laws in  P inn ish .Most de l i ca te  ru les  and cond i t ions  are  found in  sp l i t t -ing  c r i te r ia  concern ing var ious  k inds of  d iphtong,  vowel pa i rand long vowel combinat ions ,  in  which the F inn ish  language i sfa i r l y  r i ch .
Some cases  take  rea l  ear  fo r  the l~age  to  becor rec t ly  reso lved ,  but a l l  ru les  and cond i t ions  can, as soonas they have become c lear ly  es tab l i shed ,  be programned.
Thusa full competence of the Konnti language can be implementedon the computer.Prom the linguistic point of view the transformationsare interesting in the sense that they fully preserve thephono- and morphological weli-formedness of the underlyinglanguage, i.e.
the resulting words and word forms could wellbe real substance of the source language.Another notable feature is that the reverse transform-ation based on the same set and order of rules restores theoriginal words and word forms except for certain degeneratecases, which involve neutral vowels that are incapable of?
