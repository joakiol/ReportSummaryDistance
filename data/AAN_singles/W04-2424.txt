Putting Meaning into Your TreesMartha PalmerUniversity of Pennsylvaniampalmer@cis.upenn.eduThe meaning of a sentence is an essential aspect ofnatural language understanding, yet an elusive one,since there is no accepted methodology for determin-ing it.
There is not even a consensus on criteria fordistinguishing word senses.
Clearly a more robusttechnology is needed that uses data-driven techniques.These techniques typically rely on supervised machinelearning, so a critical goal is the definition of a level ofsemantic representation (sense tags and semantic rolelabels) that could be consistently annotated on a largescale.
We have been training automatic WSD systemson the English sense-tagged training data based onWordNet that we supplied to SENSEVAL2 (Dang &Palmer, 2002).
A pervasive problem with sense tag-ging is finding a sense inventory with clear criteria forsense distinctions.
WordNet is often criticized for itssubtle and fine-grained sense distinctions.
Perhapsmore consistent and coarse-grained sense distinctionswould be more suitable for natural language process-ing applications.
Grouping the highly polysemousverb senses in WordNet (on average reducing the >16senses per verb to 8) provides an important first step amore flexible granularity for WordNet senses that im-proves both inter-annotator agreement (71% to 82%)and system performance (60.2% to 69%) (Dang &Palmer, 2002).
The Frameset sense tags associatedwith the PropBank, as discussed below, provide aneven more coarse-grained and easily replicable levelof sense distinctions.Based on a consensus of colleagues participating in theACE (Automatic Content Extraction) program, wehave developed a Proposition Bank, or PropBank,which provides semantic role labels for verbs and par-ticipial modifiers for the 1M word Penn Treebank IIcorpus (Marcus, 1994).
VerbNet classes have provedinvaluable for defining the appropriate semantic rolesin this endeavor (Dang, et.
al., 1998).
For example,John is the Agent or Arg0 of John broke the window,IBM is the Theme or Arg1 of IBM rose 1.2 points.
Inaddition, for just over 700 of the most polysemousverbs in the Penn TreeBank, we have defined two ormore Framesets ?
major sense distinctions based ondiffering sets of semantic roles (Palmer, et al submit-ted).
These Framesets overlap closely (95%) with ourmanual groupings of the SENSEVAL2 verb senses,and thus they can be combined to provide an hierarchi-cal set of sense distinctions.
The PropBank is completeand a beta-release version was made publicly availablethrough LDC in February for use in the CoNLL-04shared task.
There is a complementary lexicographyproject at Berkeley, Chuck Fillmore?s FRAMENET,which provides representative annotated samples ratherthan broad-coverage annotation, and there are currentplans to combine these resources and train automaticlabelers for English and Chinese.
The automatic se-mantic role labelers we are building use features thatare very similar to our WSD system features, and wefind that semantic role label features improve WSDwhile sense tag features improve semantic role labeling(Gildea & Palmer, 2002).ReferencesDang, H.T., Kipper, K.,  Palmer, M., Rosenzweig, J.
