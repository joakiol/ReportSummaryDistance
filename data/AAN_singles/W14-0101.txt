We also report on our effort inbuilding the first prototype of KurdNet ?the Kurdish WordNet?
along with a pre-liminary evaluation of its impact on Kur-dish information retrieval.1 IntroductionWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has been used in nu-merous natural language processing tasks such asword sense disambiguation and information ex-traction with considerable success.
Motivated bythis success, many projects have been undertakento build similar lexical databases for other lan-guages.
Among the large-scale projects are Eu-roWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis etal., 2004) for European languages and IndoWord-Net (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages.Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European familyof languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a largegeographical region spanning the intersections ofIran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria.
Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which, among other re-sources, no wordnet has been built yet.We have recently launched the Kurdish lan-guage processing project (KLPP1), aiming at pro-viding basic tools and techniques for Kurdish textprocessing.
This paper reports on KLPP?s firstoutcomes on building KurdNet, the Kurdish Word-Net.At a high level, our approach is semi-automaticand centered around building a Kurdish alignment1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htmfor Base Concepts (Vossen et al, 1998), which is acore subset of major meanings in WordNet.
Morespecifically, we use a bilingual dictionary and sim-ple set theory operations to translate and alignsynsets and use a corpus to extract usage exam-ples.
The effectiveness of our prototype databaseis evaluated via measuring its impact on a Kurdishinformation retrieval task.
Throughout, we havemade the following contributions:1. highlight the main challenges in buildinga wordnet for the Kurdish language (Sec-tion 2),2. identify a list of available resources that canfacilitate the process of constructing such alexical database for Kurdish (Section 3),3. build the first prototype of KurdNet, the Kur-dish WordNet (Section 4), and4.
conduct a preliminary set of experiments toevaluate the impact of KurdNet on Kurdishinformation retrieval (Section 5).Moreover, a manual effort to translate the glossesand refine the automatically-generated outputs iscurrently underway.The latest snapshot of KurdNet?s prototype isfreely accessible and can be obtained from (KLPP,2013).
We hope that making this database pub-licly available, will bolster research on Kurdishtext processing in general, and on KurdNet in par-ticular.2 ChallengesIn the following, we highlight the main challengesin Kurdish text processing, with a greater focus on123456789101112131415161718192021222324Arabic?based?

In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standard2 language (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour etal., 2012): the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect writtenin a Latin-based alphabet.
Figure 1 shows both ofthe standard Kurdish alphabets and the mappingsbetween them.The linguistics features distinguishing thesetwo dialects are phonological, lexical, and mor-phological.
The important morphological differ-ences that concern the construction of KurdNetare (MacKenzie, 1961; Haig and Matras, 2002):(i) in contrast to Sorani, Kurmanji has retainedboth gender (feminine v. masculine) and case op-position (absolute v. oblique) for nouns and pro-nouns, and (ii) while is Kurmanji passive voice isconstructed using the helper verb ?hatin?, in So-rani it is created via verb morphology.In summary, as the examples in (Gautier, 1998)show, the ?same?
word, when going from Soranito Kurmanji, may at the same time go through sev-eral levels of change: writing systems, phonology,morphology, and sometimes semantics.2.2 Complex MorphologyKurdish has a complex morphology (Samvelian,2007; Walther, 2011) and one of the main driv-ing factors behind this complexity is the wide useof inflectional and derivational suffixes (Esmaili et2Within KLPP, our focus has been on Sorani and Kur-manji which are the two most widely-spoken and closely-related dialects (Haig and Matras, 2002; Walther and Sagot,2010).al., 2013a).
Moreover, as demonstrated by the ex-ample in Table 1, in the Sorani?s writing systemdefiniteness markers, possessive pronouns, encl-itics, and many of the widely-used postpositionsare used as suffixes (Salavati et al, 2013).One important implication of this morpho-logical complexity is that any corpus-basedassistance or analysis (e.g., frequencies, co-occurrences, sample passages) would require alemmatizer/morphological analyzer.2.3 Resource-ScarcenessAlthough there exist a few resources which canbe leveraged in building a wordnet for Kurdish ?these are listed in Section 3?
but some of the mostcrucial resources are yet to be built for this lan-guage.
One of such resources is a collection ofcomprehensive monolingual and bilingual dictio-naries.
The main problem with the existing elec-tronic dictionaries is that they are relatively smalland have no notion of sense, gender, or part-of-speech labels.Another necessary resource that is yet to bebuilt, is a mapping system (i.e., a translitera-tion/translation engine) between the Sorani andKurmanji dialects.3 Available ResourcesIn this section we give a brief description of thelinguistics resources that our team has built as wellas other useful resources that are available on theWeb.3.1 KLPP ResourcesThe main Kurdish text processing resources thatwe have previously built are as follows:?
the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati,2013): for both Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.

Basic Statistics (Es-maili and Salavati, 2013)?
the Pewan test collection (Esmaili et al, 2013a;Esmaili et al, 2013b): built upon the Pewan cor-pus, this collection has a set of 22 queries (in So-rani and Kurmanji) and their corresponding rele-vance judgments.?
the Payv lemmatizer: it is the result of a ma-jor revision of Jedar (Salavati et al, 2013), ourKurdish stemmer whose outputs are stems and notlemmas.
In order to return lemmas, Payv not onlymaintains a list of exceptions (e.g., named enti-ties), but also takes into consideration Kurdish?sinflectional rules.3.2 Web ResourcesTo the best of our knowledge, here are the otherexisting readily-usable resources that can be ob-tain from the Web:?
Dictio3: an English-to-Sorani dictionary withmore than 13,000 headwords.
It employs a collab-orative mechanism for enrichment.?
Ferheng4: a collection of dictionaries for theKurmanji dialect with sizes ranging from medium(around 25,000 entries, for German and Turkish)to small (around 4,500, for English).?
Wikipedia: it currently has more than 12,000Sorani5 and 20,000 Kurmanji6 articles.
One use-ful application of these entries is to build a parallelcollection of named entities across both dialects.4 KurdNet?s First PrototypeIn the following, we first define the scope of ourfirst prototype, then after justifying our choice ofconstruction model, we describe KurdNet?s indi-vidual elements.3http://dictio.kurditgroup.org/4http://ferheng.org/?Daxistin5http://ckb.wikipedia.org/6http://ku.wikipedia.org/4.1 ScopeIn the first prototype of KurdNet we focus only onthe Sorani dialect.
This is mainly due to lack of anavailable and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictio-nary.
Moreover, processing Sorani is in generalmore challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al,2013a).
The Kurmanji version will be built laterand will be closely aligned with its Sorani coun-terpart.
To that end, we have already started build-ing a high-quality transliterator/translator enginebetween the two dialects.4.2 MethodologyThere are two well-known models for buildingwordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998):?
Expand: in this model, the synsets are builtin correspondence with the WordNet synsetsand the semantic relations are directly im-ported.
It has been used for Italian in Mul-tiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet.?
Merge: in this model, the synsets and rela-tions are first built independently and thenthey are aligned with WordNet?s.
It has beenthe dominant model in building BalkaNet andEuroWordNet.The expand model seems less complex andguarantees the highest degree of compatibilityacross different wordnets.
But it also has potentialdrawbacks.
The most serious risk is that of forcingan excessive dependency on the lexical and con-ceptual structure of one of the languages involved,as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996).In our project, we follow the Expand model,since it can be partly automated and thereforewould be faster.
More precisely, we aim at cre-ating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the BaseConcepts (Vossen et al, 1998) which is a set of5,000 essential concepts (i.e.
synsets) that playa major role in the wordnets.
Base Concepts(BC) is available on the Global WordNet Associa-tion (GWA)?s Web page7.
The Entity-Relationship(ER) model for the data represented in Base Con-cept is shown in Figure 2.7http://globalwordnet.org/SynsetDomainDefinition UsageSUMOBCSLiteralID POSTypeLexical RelationHas / Is in N N NNSense_noFigure 2: Base Concepts?
ER Model4.3 ElementsSince KurdNet follows the Expand model, it inher-its most of Base Concepts?
structural properties,including: synsets and the lexical relations amongthem, POS, Domain, BCS, and SUMO.
KurdNet?slanguage-specific aspects, on the other hand, havebeen built using a semi-automatic approach.
Be-low, we elaborate on the details of construction theremaining three elements.Synset Alignments: for each synset in BC,its counterpart in KurdNet is defined semi-automatically.
We first use Dictio to translate itsliterals (words).
Having compiled the translationlists, we combine them in two different ways: (i) amaximal alignment (abbr.
max) which is a super-set of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment (abbr.min) which is a subset of non-empty lists.
Fig-ure 3 shows an illustration of these two combina-tion variants.
In future, we plan to apply more ad-vanced techniques, similar to the graph algorithmsdescribed in (Flati and Navigli, 2012).Usage Examples: we have taken a corpus-assistedapproach to speed-up the process of providing us-age examples for each aligned synset.
To this end,we: (i) extract all Pewan?s sentences (820,203),(ii) lemmatize the corpus to extract all the lemmas(278,873), and (iii) construct a lemma-to-sentenceinverted index.
In the current version of KurdNet,for each synset we build a pool of sentences byfetching the first 5 sentences of each of its liter-als from the inverted list.
These pools will laterbe assessed by lexicographers to filter out non-relevant instances.
In future, more sophisticatedapproaches can be applied (e.g., exploiting con-textual information).Definitions: due to lack of proper translationtools, this element must be aligned manually.
Themanual enrichment and assessment process is cur-rently underway.

task.Table 3 shows a summary of KurdNet?s statisticalproperties along with those of Base Concepts.5 Preliminary ExperimentsThe most reliable way to evaluate the quality ofa wordnet is to manually examine its content andstructure.
This is clearly very costly.
In this pa-per we have adopted an indirect evaluation alter-native in which we look at the effectiveness of us-ing KurdNet for rewriting IR queries (i.e.
queryexpansion).We measure the impact of query expansion us-ing two separate configurations: (i) Terms, whichuses the raw version of the evaluation components(queries, corpus, and KurdNet), and (ii) Lemmas,which uses the lemmatized version of them.
Fur-thermore, as depicted in Figure 4, we have con-sidered two alternatives for expanding each queryterm: (i) add all of its Synonyms, and (ii) addall of the synonyms of its direct Hypernym(s).Hence ?given the min and max variants of Kurd-Net?s synsets?
there can be at least 10 different ex-perimental scenarios.In our experiments we have used the Pewantest collection (see Section 3.1), the MG4J IR en-gine (MG4J, 2013), and the Mean Average Preci-sion (MAP) evaluation metric.The results are summarized in Table 4.
The no-table patterns are as follows:?
since lemmatization yields additionalw 0  w 2  w 1w 5  w 4  w 3  w 6(a) By its Synonymsw 0  w 2  w 1w 5  w 4  w 3  w 6(b) By its HypernymsFigure 4: Expansion Alternatives for the Term W0matches between query terms and theirinflectional variants in the documents, itimproves the performance (row 2 v. row 3).Expansion of the same lemmatized queries,however, degrades the performance (7-10 v.1,4-6).
This degradation can be attributed tothe fact that the projection of KurdNet fromterms to lemmas introduces imprecise entrymerges.?
the min approach to align synsets outper-forms its max counterpart overwhelmingly(1,4,7,8 v. 5,6,9,10), confirming the intuitionthat the max approach entails high-ambiguity,?
expanding query terms by their own syn-onyms is less effective than by their hyper-nyms?
synonyms.
This phenomena might beexplained by the fact that currently for eachquery term, we use all of its synonyms andno sense disambiguation is applied.Needless to say, a more detailed analysis of theoutputs can provide further insights about theabove results and claims.6 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper we briefly highlighted the mainchallenges in building a lexical database for theKurdish language and presented the first prototypeof KurdNet ?the Kurdish WordNet?
along with apreliminary evaluation of its impact on KurdishIR.We would like to note once more that the Kurd-Net project is a work in progress.
Apart fromthe manual enrichment and assessment of the de-scribed prototype which is currently underway,there are many avenues to continue this work.First, we would like to extend our prototype toinclude the Kurmanji dialect.
This would requirenot only using similar resources to those reported# Scenario MAP1 Terms & Hypernyms (min) 0.42652 Lemmas 0.42633 Terms 0.40754 Terms & Synonyms (min) 0.39785 Terms & Hypernyms (max) 0.39606 Terms & Synonyms (max) 0.38417 Lemmas & Hypernyms (min) 0.38408 Lemmas & Synonyms (min) 0.35879 Lemmas & Hypernyms (max) 0.253010 Lemmas & Synonyms (max) 0.2215Table 4: Different KurdNet-based Query Expan-sion Scenarios and Their Impact on Kurdish IRin this paper, but also building a mapping systembetween the Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.Another direction for future work is to prune thecurrent structure i.e.
