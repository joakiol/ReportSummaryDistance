CSNETABSlRACTA metric for assessing the e~mplemlty of mmmntic(and pragmatic) analysis in natural languageprocessing is proposed as part of a general appliedtheory of linguistic semantics for NLP.
The theoryis intended as a complete projection of linguisticsemantics onto NLP and is designed as sa exhaustivelist of possible choices among strategies ofaementlc analysis at each level, from the word tothe entire text.
The alternatives are summarized ina chart, w~ch can be ccmpleted for each existingor projected MLP system.
The remaining componentsof the applied theory are also outlined.i.
GoalThe immediate goal of the paper is to explore thealternative choices in the analysis of meaning in naturallsaguage processing (I~P).
Throughout the paper, semanticssubsumes pragmatics.
The mere an~itioes goal of the paper,however, is to lay ground for an appl~ed theory of~t i~ for ~2 ?~ST/~2).2.
~ ~ of ~ smmtics for mmralAL6TAxLP is a part of an applied ~ theory fornatural ~ngnage pmoeessing (ALT/NLP).
The latter obviouslyincludes other ccmponsats, most prominently syntax sadmorphology.
The applied theory is the result of a projectionof linguistic theory onto tlm NIP plane or, in other tenas,sa adaptation Of general linguistic theory specifically forl~P purposes.2.1.
~ t i s  Theo__q?, Semantic Theor Z.
The modernconcept of linguistic theory, developed primarily by Ch~sky(1965), is that of a set of statements which i)characterizes language as a cc~plex structure sad describethat structure tap down, 2) underlies each description of aparticular language and determines the format of such adescription.
Semantic theory as part of linguistic theorydetermines semantic descriptiens.
Semantic descriptionsassign mesaings to sentences, and each meaning is a fonmalalogically deduced from the rules provided by seamntic theoryald utilized in the descr~tion.
A valid semanticdescription assigns each sentence the sere meaning that thenative speaker does.The theoretical inadequacy of m/ch of contemporarylinguistics may stem from Chomsky's ~ that the theory isone.
An alternative viow of ~ as the ex~sL~tive ~ ofaltenmatlves, complete with the issues on which thealternatives differ and the consequences of each choice, iss~ply indispensable for applications.2.2.
~ Applications and NLP.
A meaningfulapplication of linguistics always deals with a problem whichcomes entirely from the area of application and not fromlinguistics.
Every ~ system requires the description of anatural language fragment, often of a sublsaguage.
On theone hand, modem linguistics, with its emphasis onformality, would seem to be uniquely sad unprecedentedlyqualified to supply such a description.
On the other band,while every single fact about language the ~P expert needsis out there in linguia~ics, much of it is not easilyancessible.
Descriptions posing as theories or theoriesposing as descriptions tend not to list all the necessaryfacts in any way facilitating computer Jmpemsatation (seebelow).
The only solution to the problem is to develop a~ .m ~omBtm ~ ~ pmdemm~ ~k*mwledg~ onto NLP, which is what ALT/NLP is ell about.2.3.
~ Theo~, I: ALT/NLP.
ALT/hLP deals withpretty much the same facts and phenomena of language aslinguistics per s e. There are, however, eroaial differences.First, while both "pure" and "applied" theories are formal,the nature of the fo~d/sm is differ~mt.
Second, purelinguistic theory deals with a language as a whole whileALT/~LP deals with limited and relatively closedsublalgusges or language fragments (sen Raakin 1971, 1974,1985b; Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982).Third, pure linguistic theory must ansure a complete andeven coverage of everything in the texture of language;ALT/hLP analyze only as much as needed for the purposes ofNLP and ignore all the linguistic informatisa that issuperfluous for it.
Fourth, the ultimate criterion ofvalidity for pure linguistic theory is the elusiveexplanatory adequacy; the ultimate criterion for ALT/h\[2 iswhether ~ systems resulting from its application work.Fifth, pure linguistic theory can afford not to pursuethe issue once a method or a principle is established.
InALT/hLP, everything should be dose explicitly to tlm veryend, and no eKtrapolatios is possible.
And finally, purelinguistic t/~eory has to be concerned about the botmdarybetween linguistic and encyclopedic knowledge, i.e., betweencur knowledge of language and our knowledge of the world(cf.
Raskin 1985a).
There may be no particular need tomaintain this distinction in an hLP system (cf.
Schenk etal.
1985) because the computer needs all the I~nds ofavailable information for processing the data.2.4.
~ ~ II: ASLT/hLP.
AS~,  a pr~ectionof lin~dstic mmm~ties onto NLY, is designed to serve allthe various hip systems.
Therefore, it is viewed sad set upas the e~mnative list of possibilities for semanticm~lysls and de~ription available in linguistic semantics.The intended use of A~T/NLP is to bring to the NiPousta~er, not necessarily knowledgeable in linguistics, thetotality of what linguistics knows about meaning by i)listing ell the choices available at each level of sanmnticanalysis, 2) determining causal connections among choicessad the propagation of constraints through the choice space,3) assessing say existing NLP system as to the c~lexity ofits ssnantic equipment sad the possibilities of expanding itin the desired direction if necessary, and 4) relating eachchain of compatible choices to the practical needs andresources.
This paper deals almost ~clusively with thefirst item on this agenda.3.
The ~ Scale of Semantic Anal sy~.The scale proposed in this section is a list of choicesavailable at each of the five levels of semantic m~slysiscorresl0cnding to the five meaningful linguistic entitiespertinent to ELP - the word, the ~ ,  the sentence, theand the text, or discourse.
At each level,attention is paid to such dimensions as the cc~pleteneas andrelative depth of analysis.All the emsmples are taken from one paragraph (I) inUl\]msa (1982:1-2).
The paragraph does not stand out in anysense except that it clearly belongs to the ccmputersablanguage of IMglish.
(I) (i) Data, such as the above, that is stored more or lesspem~anently in a c~puter we te~m a database.
(ii) The software that allows one or msay persons to usesad/or modify this data is a database mana~emanteros).
(iii) A major role of the D~M8 is to allow tlm user todeal with the data in abstract terms, rather than asthe computer stores the data.
(iv) In this sense, the D~MS acts as an interpreter for ahlgh-level programming language, ideally allowingthe user to specify what most be done, with littleor no attention on the user's part to the detailedalgorithms or data representation used by thesystem.
(v) However, in the case of a D\]IMS, there may be farless relationship between the data as ~ by theuser and as stored in the computer, than between,say, arrays as defined in a typical programminglanguage and the representation of those arrays inmemory.3383.
I.
The Word.
The asmantic descriptions of the words areusually stored in the dictionary of an NLP system.
~ematym~ ~ t~ w~ level may be full ~ ~/a l .
Theanalysis i~ full if every word of the analyzed text iss~ppesed to have a non-~pty (i.e., distinct from just thespelling) entry in the dictionary.
The analysis is partialif oaly sa~e words must have an entry.
Thes, an analysis of(li) as a sequence of three key words (for instance, inautomatic obstranting), as sho~n in (2), is definitelypartial.
(2) DATA ~ DATAm~'1~ae ~mi~ may be ~ted  or tml~mlted.
The analysis isunlimited if the meaning of t t~ word needs to he utilized inits entirety.
The analysis is limited if, for the purpese~of a given NLP, it would suffice, for instate, to describethe words in (3i) as physical objects and the words in (3ii)as mental objects and omit all the other elements of tl~irmeanings.
(3) (i) penmen, operator, computer(ii) data, database, algorithm~other version of limited analysis would be to analyzethe meanings of the words to the point of distinguishingeach word from any other word and no further.
Th~s, !~eratorsnd ~ can be distinguished in terms of semanticdescription as sh~n in (4).
(4) (i) o_o_~erator: Physical Cbject, ~imate(ii) c ca~_te___Er: Plr fsical Object, Inan/mateIt is worth noting tl~t while person and !~erator can besimJ/srly d:Lstinguished along the lines of (5), they cannothe distingtdslmd in the computer sublanguage and are,therefore, complete synonyms.
In other words, person is theparent of ~ in English as a whole but not in thissublangsage.
(5) (i) person: }hman(il) operator: Humsn, Using Gadget~*e sm~lysi~ can use a rammer of metheds.
The first andmin~Ll one seems to be the ~ approach, e.g.,key-word analysis.
Within this approach, words are assi@guadto certain semantic classes, represented by what is oftencalled key words or descriptors, and this r~ains their onlycharacteristic.
In mare sophisticated versions, descriptorsmay he further m~categorized, i.e., parent-child relationsm~ong them ,,,an be set up, and disti~a~y entries will thencontain hielarchles of them, e.g..
(6).
(6) data M~TPAL OBJELT (It4PUT~-P/KAT~Second, a form of feature (or eom\[x*~ntlal) snalysis canbe used.
The rosin distinction between feature analysis andset membersl~p is that, in the fozmer, the features comefrom different hierarchies.
Thus, for (6) to be an exsmpleof feature analysis rather tlmn of descriptor analysis,CQMP~\]I~R EIAT~D should not be a child of ME2~_AL OBJECT inthe system.X1%ird, tie dicti~mry entries may be set up as netwo,\]~.In lings~stic semantics, the concept of semantic field (sea,for instsnce, Raskln 1983:31-2) corresponds to a primitivenetwork.
In a pure netwozk-besed approach, only actual wordsserve as the nodes - there are no nmta~ords or categorJalma~ers (unlike in syntactical trees) and no primes (unlikein feature analysis).
The netwonks may have weighted ortmweighted \].inks (edges); they may also, or alternatively,be labeled or tmlabeled.
The number of labels may vary.
Thelabels cen also he set up as the other kind of nodes.Generally, the nodes caa be equal (flat) or unequal(hierarchical).
~Ims, redness may be set up as a node while___~ is a slot of a physical object, connected with theredness node by the link color.3.2.
The Clanse.
The clause boundaries are obtainedthrough tl~ application of a syntactic parser.
Thefull/partial dimession at this level deals with whetherevery cl~ase of the sentence is armlyzed or some areomitted, and the latter is not Jmpasslble.
Theunlimited/limited dimension deals with the detalization ofthe analysis along the various paraneters (see below).Decisions on both of the (lims~ioas may be predeteunined bythose taken at the ~rd  level.
In general, the ~ll/partialand unlimited/llmited dimensions become the more trivial andobvious the higher the level.
Accordingly, while fullyreflected at each level ~i the chart in (I0), they will hehardly mentioned iu the subsequent subsections.The most ~mportent decision to nmke at the clause levelis whether the ontput is structured or not.
The unstmctm-~will simply list tl~ semantic characteristics of allthe words in the alanse which have them, in the order oftheir appear~mce.
The only clanse-ralated infor.mtion insuch a csSe wLll be tl~e classe boundaries.The stm~tt~ed outlm~?
may he dependent on t}~enatural-language syntax of the clause or not.
The acceptedterms are :  semm~t~c ~,*terpretati(n fors2mtsc t icalls~dependent outputs, and semanticrepre~tari~,, otherwise.
In a t~plcal semBnticrepresentatictl, a tree-like structure, such as (i0) (of.Nirenherg et al 1985:233), may he set up for clausesinstead of t|m/r re~lar syntactic strastures, with thenodes and/or link labels being of a different nature.event with its antsnts as in (7ii) should be an obviouspossible cheice for the analysis of the clause.
Thestructures may be more or less distant from the syntacticstr~ture (in any guise) but the presence of just onesemantic node or - more often - link \]abe\].
would render themnon-syntactic.
(7) (i) \[data\] is stored ~)re or less peunanently inthe cc~uter(ii) storeagent object t~,e space goaloperator data elways con~uter maintain-datsbaseIn (7ii).
the deviations from syntactic structure aboundand include most prominenC\[y i) different link labels, e.g.,goal; 2) substitution of m~lengusge-deter~dned paraphrases,e.g., ~ for more or less pemanently; 3) infonmtionnot contained in the clause asd supplied frcm thesublanguage knowledge base, e.g., L ~ -- maintain-database.Whether information for the semantical analysis of theclause is supplied from ontside of the clause as well asfrom inside for its analysis or only from inside dete~ineswhether the analysis is s~n~-?mpasitiomsl or eomp(~itimal.Finally, the clause analysis may include or ~cludesuprapropesiticnal infomm!iticn.
~ y  proimeiti~mlanmlysis will basically mml~ze the clause as a sentence.Thus, (7i) w:\[ll be analyzed without the square brscketsaround da__~, which signify that the word is the suppliedantecedent for a proncadnal entity (that),S~mpro~s i t lmml  mmlys~J typically subsumes propesiticaalenalysis and adds to it the infonnation on the links of theclause with the other classes of its own and/or t}~e adjacentsentences.
Thus, in the case of (7i), that sh~tld be relatedto data two clauses earlier end the nature of the l~nkshould be described: synt~:!tically, it is a relative clause;}~wever, a sementlc label, such as EXPANSION, would be muchmore infolmatJ~e (sea also below).3.3.
The Sentence.
The first important phenomenon toconsider at the sentence level is whether the sentence isrepresented as a claasal d~cmmse sfcxt~tmu~ or not.
If thesentence is not represented as such a structure, it becomessimply a sequence of classes su i ted  by syntacticaldependency infomnatien.
~mh a sequence will not be muchdistinct from a sequence of monoclaussl sentences, e~eptthat some of them will be eEustered together.
If the clausaldiscourse structure is there, i t  wi l l  be probably presentedas a graph with the clauses for nodes and relations betweenthem for link labels.
Again, as in the case of the clause,the link labels may renge fron the syntactic ten~s tosemantic relations.
A more semantically informativestructure, with semantic l:h'~, labels, is illustrated in (8)for (li) :339(8) Data... we term a databasesuch as the above that is stored mere or less pe*~mnentlyin a ccmputerS~m~ntic link labels are often associated withnon-syntactic clauses being distinguished - thus, such asthe above is not a full-fledged syntactic clause.L~ce clause analysis, sentence analysis may be?~mpomitim~ or m~p~iti~ml.
There is much meresupraccmpesitional information available at this level thanat the clause level.
The strpracompesitionsl information is,of course, knowledge-based.
It can include i) semantic fieldinformation for words (paradigmatic semantic infonmation),i.e., that c__~ter in (I) is a machine or a mechanicaldevice and that certain other words, probably not in thesublanguage, are fellow members of the field; 2) informationon the relations of the sentence with the world or subworld(for a sublanguage), e.g., for (I), the meaning of eachsentence is clarified if semantic analysis utilizes a ruleabout the subworld, namely that avery mental object in thesubworld is located in the computer memory; 3) speech actinfo~nation, i.e., whether the sentence is an assertion, aquestion, a c(~mend or any other possible value of theillocutionary-force variable (see ~burg  et al1985:234); 4) informatJ~n on d~e I~  of the sentence withother sentences (see the n~t  paragraph); 5) given/newinformation, e.g., that this data is given in (lii); 6) mainclause infozmation.Information on the links of the sentence with othersentences includes connectives, both explicit as, forinstance, however in (iv), aud implicit.
This infomaties iscrucial for establishing the discourse structure of theparagraph (see 3.4).
~ch info~nation is used only insystems which acccm~0date ~trasent~mtial ~nfommti~n andignored by systems with emlusively ~ntentiel in fo~.Finally, each sentence can be characterized as to theit expresses.
In a textbook exposition llke (i), thegoal tends to be nnnotonous - it is to convey information orto teach, but in a narrative te~t with protagonists or in adialogue, goals can vary with each cue (see Schank andAbe/son 1977; Reichman 1985).3.4.
The ~ .
The semantic analysis of theparagraph may include its representation as a sent~mtiel~ or not include it.
If there is no suchrepresentation, then similarly to sentence analysis, theparagraph will be treated s~mply as a linear sequence ofsentences.
Otherwise, the paragraph may be represented an agraph with sentences for nudes and with relations betweenthe sentences for label links.
No standard syntacticalnomenclature is available for this level.
Using one simplesemantic link label, (I) may be represented as (9) :(9) (li)~p~sion( l i i )~pansi~ j~ans ien  ~ ~ i o n(liii) ~ ( l i v ) ~  (Iv)Because of the nature of (i) and of its sublengusge, thelinks hetwesn the sentences are much less diverse than incasual discourse - and this is good for ~LP.
It is possible,end often advisable to combine the clausal structures of thesentences end the sententisl st~ctures of the paragraph inone graph, because frequently a clause Jn one sentence islinked to a clause in another rather than the whole sentenceto the other, and the resulting graph is mere informative.It is also important to decide at this level whether todevelop peragraph tnp4n eKtraetien or not.
For the fozmeroptien, the paragraph can be summrlzed by creating a newsentence or, alternatively, one of the emisting sentences isselected to "represent" the whole paragraph.3.5.
