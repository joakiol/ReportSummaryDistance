?IIIT Hyderabadratish.surendran@research.iiit.ac.inPushpak BhattacharyyaIIT Bombaypb@cse.iitb.ac.inAbstractWe present Brahmi-Net - an online system fortransliteration and script conversion for all ma-jor Indian language pairs (306 pairs).
The sys-tem covers 13 Indo-Aryan languages, 4 Dra-vidian languages and English.
For trainingthe transliteration systems, we mined paral-lel transliteration corpora from parallel trans-lation corpora using an unsupervised methodand trained statistical transliteration systemsusing the mined corpora.
Languages whichdo not have parallel corpora are supportedby transliteration through a bridge language.Our script conversion system supports con-version between all Brahmi-derived scripts aswell as ITRANS romanization scheme.
Forthis, we leverage co-ordinated Unicode rangesbetween Indic scripts and use an extendedITRANS encoding for transliterating betweenEnglish and Indic scripts.
The system also pro-vides top-k transliterations and simultaneoustransliteration into multiple output languages.We provide a Python as well as REST API toaccess these services.
The API and the minedtransliteration corpus are made available forresearch use under an open source license.1 IntroductionThe Indian subcontinent is home to some of the mostwidely spoken languages of the world.
It is uniquein terms of the large number of scripts used for writ-ing these languages.
Most of the these are abugidascripts derived from the Brahmi script.
Brahmi is?These authors contributed equally to this project?Work done while the author was at IIT Bombayone of the oldest writing systems of the Indian sub-continent which can be dated to at least the 3rd cen-tury B.C.E.
In addition, Arabic-derived and Romanscripts are also used for some languages.
Given thediversity of languages and scripts, transliteration andscript conversion are extremely important to enableeffective communication.The goal of script conversion is to represent thesource script accurately in the target script, withoutloss of phonetic information.
It is useful for exactlyreading manuscripts, signboards, etc.
It can serveas a useful tool for linguists, NLP researchers, etc.whose research is multilingual in nature.
Script con-version enables reading text written in foreign scriptsaccurately in a user's native script.
On the otherhand, transliteration aims to conform to the phonol-ogy of the target language, while being close to thesource language phonetics.
Transliteration is neededfor phonetic input systems, cross-lingual informa-tion retrieval, question-answering, machine transla-tion and other cross-lingual applications.Brahmi-Net is a general purpose transliterationand script conversion system that aims to provide so-lutions for South Asian scripts and languages.
Whiletransliteration and script conversion are challenginggiven the scale and diversity, we leverage the com-monality in the phonetics and the scriptural systemsof these languages.
The major features of Brahmi-Net are:1.
It supports 18 languages and 306 languagepairs for statistical transliteration.
The sup-ported languages cover 13 Indo-Aryan lan-guage (Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi,Konkani, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, San-skrit, Sindhi, Sinhala, Urdu) , 4 Dravidian lan-81guages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu)and English.
To the best of our knowledge,no other system covers as many languages andscripts.2.
It supports script conversion among the fol-lowing 10 scripts used by major Indo-Aryanand Dravidian languages: Bengali, Gujarati,Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, Devana-gari, Sinhala, Tamil and Telugu.
Some of thesescripts are used for writing multiple languages.Devanagari is used for writing Hindi, Sanskrit,Marathi, Nepali, Konkani and Sindhi.
The Ben-gali script is also used for writing Assamese.Also, Sanskrit has historically been written inmany of the above mentioned scripts.3.
The system also supports an extended ITRANStransliteration scheme for romanization of theIndic scripts.4.
The transliteration and script conversion sys-tems are accessible via an online portal.
Someadditional features include the ability to simul-taneously view transliterations to all availablelanguages and the top-k best transliterations.5.
AnApplication Programming Interface (API) isavailable as a Python package and a REST in-terface for easy integration of the transliterationand script conversion systems into other appli-cations requiring transliteration services.6.
As part of the project, parallel transliterationcorpora has been mined for transliteration be-tween 110 languages pairs for the following 11languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Konkani,Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu, Malayalam, Tamil,Telugu and English.
The parallel translitera-tion corpora is comprised of 1,694,576 wordpairs across all language pairs, which is roughly15,000 mined pairs per language pair.2 Script ConversionOur script conversion engine contains two rule-based systems: one for script conversion amongstscripts of the Brahmi family, and the other for ro-manization of Brahmi scripts.2.1 Among scripts of the Brahmi familyEach Brahmi-derived Indian language script hasbeen allocated a distinct codepoint range in the Uni-code standard.
These scripts have a similar char-acter inventory, but different glyphs.
Hence, thefirst 85 characters in each Unicode block are in thesame order and position, on a script by script basis.Our script conversion method simply maps the code-points between the two scripts.The Tamil script is different from other scriptssince it uses the characters for unvoiced, unaspi-rated plosives for representing voiced and/or aspi-rated plosives.
When converting into the Tamilscript, we substitute all voiced and/or aspirated plo-sives by the corresponding unvoiced, unaspiratedplosive in the Tamil script.
For Sinhala, we do an ex-plicit mapping between the characters since the Uni-code ranges are not coordinated.This simple script conversion scheme accounts fora vast majority of the characters.
However, thereare some characters which do not have equivalentsin other scripts, an issue we have not addressed sofar.
For instance, the Dravidian scripts do not havethe nukta character.2.2 Between a Roman transliteration schemeand scripts from the Brahmi familyWe chose ITRANS1 as our transliteration schemesince: (i) it can be entered using Roman keyboardcharacters, (ii) the Roman character mappings mapto Indic script characters in a phonetically intuitivefashion.
The official ITRANS specification is lim-ited to the Devanagari script.
We have added a fewextensions to account for some characters not foundin non-Devanagari scripts.
Our extended encodingis backward compatible with ITRANS.
We convertDevanagari to ITRANS using Alan Little's pythonmodule2.
For romanization of other scripts, we useDevanagari as a pivot script and use the inter-Brahmiscript converter mentioned in Section 2.1.3 TransliterationThough Indian language scripts are phonetic andlargely unambiguous, script conversion is not a sub-1http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/2http://www.alanlittle.org/projects/transliterator/transliterator.html82stitute for transliteration which needs to account forthe target language phonology and orthographic con-ventions.
The main challenges that machine translit-eration systems encounter are: script specifications,missing sounds, transliteration variants, language oforigin, etc.
(Karimi et al, 2011).
A summary of thechallenges specific to Indian languages is describedby Antony, P. J. and Soman, K.P.
(2011).3.1 Transliteration MiningStatistical transliteration can address these chal-lenges by learning transliteration divergences from aparallel transliteration corpus.
For most Indian lan-guage pairs, parallel transliteration corpora are notpublicly available.
Hence, we mine transliterationcorpora for 110 language pairs from the ILCI corpus,a parallel translation corpora of 11 Indian languages(Jha, 2012).
Transliteration pairs are mined usingthe unsupervised approach proposed by Sajjad et al(2012) and implemented in the Moses SMT system(Durrani et al, 2014).
Their approach models paral-lel translation corpus generation as a generative pro-cess comprising an interpolation of a transliterationand a non-transliteration process.
The parameters ofthe generative process are learnt using the EM proce-dure, followed by extraction of transliteration pairsfrom the parallel corpora.Table 1 shows the statistics of mined pairs.
Wemined a total of 1.69 million word pairs for 110 lan-guage pairs.
We observed disparity in the counts ofmined transliteration pairs across languages.
Lan-guage pairs of the Indo-Aryan family from geo-graphically contiguous regions have more numberof mined pairs.
For instance, the hin-pan, hin-guj, mar-guj, kok-mar pairs have high number ofmined transliterations averaging more than 30,000entries.
The mined pairs are diverse, containingspelling variations, orthographic variations, soundshifts, cognates and loan words.3.2 Training transliteration systemsWe model the transliteration problem as a phrasebased translation problem, a common approachwhich learns mappings from character sequences inthe source language to the target language.
The sys-tems were trained on the mined transliteration par-allel corpus using Moses.
The mined pairs are firstsegmented and a phrase-based machine translationsystem is trained on them.We used a hybrid approach for transliteration in-volving languages for which we could not minea parallel transliteration corpus.
Source languageswhich cannot be statistically transliterated are firsttransliterated into a phonetically close language(bridge language) using the above-mentioned rule-based system.
The bridge language is then transliter-ated into the target language using statistical translit-eration.
Similarly, for target languages which cannotbe statistically transliterated, the source is first sta-tistically transliterated into a phonetically close lan-guage, followed by rule-based transliteration into thetarget language.4 Brahmi-Net InterfaceBrahmi-Net is accessible via a web interface as wellan API.
We describe these interfaces in this section.4.1 Web InterfaceThe purpose of the Web interface is to allow usersquick access to transliteration and script conversionservices.
They can also choose to see the translitera-tion/script conversion output in all target languages,making comparison easier.
Alternative choices oftransliteration can also be studied by requesting thetop-5 transliterations for each input.
A snapshot ofthe interface is shown in Figure 1.
The web interfaceis accessible at:http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/brahminet/4.2 REST APIWe provide a REST interface to access the transliter-ation and script conversion services.
Simultaneoustransliterations/script conversion into all languagesand top-k transliterations are also available.
TheREST endpoints have an intuitive signature.
For in-stance, to fetch the transliteration for a word fromEnglish (en) to Hindi (hi), the REST endpoint is:http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indicnlpweb/indicnlpws/transliterate/en/hi/<input>/statisticalThe API returns a serialized JSON object containinga dictionary of target language to top-k translitera-tions.

For thisevaluation, we used an internally available, manu-ally created corpus of 1000 transliteration pairs foreach language pair.
These transliterations were man-ually curated from synsets in IndoWordNet3 Thoughthis corpus does not reflect the diversity in the minedtransliterations, evaluation on this corpus could be apointer to utility of the transliteration corpus.

Table 2 shows the accu-racy values.
top-1 indicates exact match for thefirst transliteration output returned by our system,whereas top-5 indicates match in the top 5 translit-erations returned by the system.5.2 Case Study: Improving SMT outputOur work in developing the transliteration systemswas initially motivated by the need for transliteratingthe untranslated words in SMT output.
To evaluatethe transliteration systems in the context of machinetranslation, we post-edited the phrase based system(PB-SMT) outputs of Indian language pairs providedby Kunchukuttan et al (2014) using our translitera-tion systems.
Each untranslated word was replacedby each of its top-1000 transliterations and the re-sulting candidate sentences were re-ranked using alanguage model.
We observe a significant improve-ment in translation quality across language pairs, asmeasured by the BLEU evaluation metric.
Due tospace constraints, we present results for only 8 lan-guage pairs in Table 3.
We observed that thoughthe system's best transliteration is not always correct,the sentence context and the language model selectthe right transliteration from the top-k transliteration84Lang PB-SMT PB-SMTPair +transliturd-eng 21.0 21.59tel-eng 12.09 12.34kok-ben 24.61 27.69pan-hin 71.26 75.25mar-pan 34.75 36.92tel-mal 6.58 7.54guj-tel 16.57 18.61tal-urd 15.65 16.22Table 3: Results of PB-SMT output + transliteration ofOOVs (%BLEU)candidates.
The top-k transliterations can thus bedisambiguated by SMT or other downstream appli-cations.6 ConclusionBrahmi-Net is an effort to provide a comprehen-sive transliteration and script conversion solutionfor all languages of the Indian subcontinent.
Un-supervised transliteration mining and leveraging thephonetic and scriptural similarities between the lan-guages have been the key ingredients in scaling thesystem to a large number of languages.
Even thesimple phrase based SMT model of transliterationhas proved useful for transliterating the output ofMT systems.
A natural extension would be to em-ploy richer transliteration models.
There is scopefor improvement in the hybrid models of transliter-ation used in the system.
Some of the finer detailsregarding script conversions have to be ironed out.Finally, a long term goal is to support other majorlanguages from South Asia, which differ phoneti-cally from the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languagesor use non-Brahmi scripts.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Arjun Atreya for makingavailable parallel transliterations from IndoWordNetfor evaluation of our system.ReferencesAntony, P.
