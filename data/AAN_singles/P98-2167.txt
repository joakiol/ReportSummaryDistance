But building large and fault-less annotated corpus is a very difficult job.This paper proposes an efficient method to con-struct part-of-speech tagged corpus.
A rule-based error correction method is proposed tofind and correct errors semi-automatically buser-defined rules.
We also make use of user'scorrection log to reflect feedback.
Experimentswere carried out to show the efficiency of errorcorrection process of this workbench.
The re-sult shows that about 63.2 % of tagging errorscan be corrected.1 In t roduct ionNatural language processing system using cor-pus needs the large amount of corpus (Choi etal., 1994), but it also requires the high quality.The process of making the general annotatedcorpus can be viewed as Figure 1.
There aresome difficulties in processing the annotatedcorpus.
First, the number of items in a dictio-nary is not so large.
The second problem is inthe difficulty of modifying the errors producedby automatic tagging.
Manual error correctionwould require large amount of costs, and theremay still remain errors after correcting process.There were also researches about automatic or-rection, but they had problems about the side-effects after automatic error correction (Lee andLee, 1996; Lim et al, 1996).In this paper, we will integrate the morpho-logical analysis and tagging, and provide inter-active user interface.
User gives the feedbackto resolve the ambiguities of analysis.
To re-duce the cost and improve the correctness, wehave developed an environment which is enableto find errors and modify them.In the following section, related works are de-scribed.
In section 3, we propose our model.Then, implementation and experiment resultsare explained.
Finally, discussion is followed.2 Re la ted  WorksAn automatic tagging is prone to errors thatcannot be avoidable due to the lack of over-all linguistic information.
To model the au-tomatic error-detection process, the statisticalapproach of detecting tagging error has beendeveloped (Foster, 1991).
In this section,we will describe some approaches about rule-based error correction method for Korean part-of-speech(hereafter, "POS") tagging system.2.1 T rans format ion -BasedPar t -o f -Speech  Tagg ing  System(Lim et al, 1996) proposed tagging system thatuses word-tag transformation rules dealing withagglutinative characteristics of Korean, and alsoextends the tagger by using specific transforma-tion rule considering the lexical information ofmistagged word.General training algorithm of the transforma-tion rule (Brill, 1993) is as follows:1.
Train initial tagger on initial training cor-pus Co.2.
Make Confusion matrix with the result ofcomparing the current training corpus Ci(initially, i -- 0) and C~, the output of amanual annotation on Co.3.
Extract rules correcting the errors of Con-fusion matrix best.4.
Apply the extracted tagging rules to thetraining corpus Ci and generate improvedversion Ci+l.5.
Save the rule and increase i.1015dt~umenlknowledgeprogram4I/i//s /I User 1Aolomalk rer~or correctionfManual ~rror CorrectionFigure 1: Process of making part-of-speech tag annotated corpus6.
Repeat steps 2 to 5 until frequency of errorcorrection, which is done by rules found inthe previous tep, is less than threshold.2.2 Ru le -based  Error  Cor rect ionThis method (Lee and Lee, 1996) is basedon Eric Brill's tagging model (Brill, 1993).This tagging system is a hybrid system usingboth statistical training and rule-based training.Rule-based training is performed only on thestatistical tagging errors.
The rules are learnedby comparing the correctly tagged corpus withthe output of tagger.
The training is leveragedto learn the error-correction rules.3 P roposed  Mode l3.1 The  Causes  of  Par t -o f -SpeechTagg ing  Er rorWe will mention important causes to make POStagging errors.
The first cause comes from thelow accuracy at tagging unknown words, sinceassigning the most likely tag for unknown wordscannot be expected to give a good result.
Sec-ond, the linguistic information reflects only themorpheme concatenation, as mentioned in theprevious section.
Especially, errors occur be-cause of the complex morphological characteris-tics of Korean.
Third, the ambiguities of mean-ings cannot be resolved, since tagger would notdistinguish them in the morphological level.3.2 P rocess ing  Unknown WordsSome of the tagging errors come from the un-known word - absence of the word entry in thedictionary.
If at least one sequence of morpho-logical analysis can produce sequence of mor-phemes registered in the dictionary, the un-known word identification routine does not workeven if other sequence contains unknown word.If no sequence is successful, then the system sug-gests the possible POS-tagged unknown words.In our system, if the morphological analyzercannot find that all morphemes are in the dic-tionary, unknown words are supposed to be in-cluded in the word.
Then, the user adds theunknown words into the dictionary with dictio-nary manager, if any.
After adding the words,morphological nalyzer is called once again.
Be-cause the user adds the identified unknownwords into the dictionary, morphological over-analysis can be avoided.3.3 Cor rect ion  of  E r rorsThe result produced by any tagger will containerrors, and correcting these errors would costvery much.
Hence, it would be helpful to correcttagging errors using a system which finds errorsand correct hem.
To correct errors in this pro-posed model is defined first to suggest candidatetags to the user and then to find words whichis likely to be wrong tagged.
Correction rule1016and manual  correction log are necessary for au-tomatic error detection and candidate sugges-tion.
Rule-based method is a way of findingthe wrong tags with exact match using the pre-described rule and suggestion pair.
The correc-tion rules are in the form of:(<current  morpheme>< current tag>)* /pos i t ion of wrong mor-pheme or tag/corrected morpheme or ta 9where ?
means the repetition.
Four kinds ofoperators can be used in current morpheme ortag.?
Don ' t  Care( . )
indicates that matchingwith all morpheme or tag is permitted.
Ifwe replace all the tag a after noun wordwith tag/3, the rule ', < noun > * < a >/4 /</3  >' is used.?
Or(I ) allows to match any one of the ex-pressions.
If we replace all the tag a aftercommon or proper noun word with tag/3,the rule ' ,  < noun > I < propernoun >?
< a >/4 /</3  >' is used.?
Closure(-{-) matches only the content be-fore "+".
If we replace all the tag a af-ter common noun(tagged as 'ncn', 'ncpa','ncps'), with tag /3, the rule, '*nc + * <a >/4 /</3  >' is sufficient.?
Not(!)
matches except expressions follow-ing "!"
If we replace all the tag excepta after noun word with tag a, the rule'* < noun > *!
< a > /4/ < a >' isused.For example, the following rule can replace allthe tag 'jcs' before the word "-~ r%(doeda)" with'jet'.'
, jcs ~ (doe) pvg / 2 / jcc'Another is the method of using manual cor-rection log.
Errors which are not detected bycorrection rules should be corrected by humantagger.
The result of correction is compiledfor the next time.
Manual log is composedof part of error and part of suggestion.
Forexample, when we change "u\]-~(da'un)/ncpa"to "~(dab)/xsm-t-t-(n)/etm", the entry willbe 'da'un/ncpa, dab/xsm+n/etm'.
We canadapt the entry to the augmented case,such as '~(saram) /ncn+da 'un /ncpa ' ,  '2,-7, (hag'gyo)/ncn+da'un/ncpa'.Correction rule can apply to the many kindsof word phrase; while manual og is concernedabout only one instance of word phrase.
Withthe manual correction logs, many repetitive r-rors in a document can be remedied.4 ImplementationWe have implemented error-correction e viron-ment to provide the human tagger with theinteractive and efficient tagging environment.The overall structure of our environment isshown in Figure 2.The process of making POS-tagged docu-ments in this environment is as follows:1.
Identify unknown words through morpho-logical analysis.2.
Add unknown word to the dictionary.3.
Repeat morphological analysis using up-dated dictionary until no more unknownword is found.4.
Run automatic POS tagging.5.
Detect unknown word error and suggest acorrect candidate word.6.
Act according to reaction of human tagger- approving modificaton or not, receivingdirect input from the human tagger.7.
Repeat steps 5 and 6 with automatic errorcorrection using rules and correction logsso that incremental improvement of taggingaccurarcy can be achieved.8.
Correct manually, if there is any error,which is not detected.9.
Save what the human tagger corrected atstep 8, and start detecting errors and givesuggestion on the POS-tagged ocument,with manual og.10.
If unknown word exists in the result fromstep 9, save the result in the dictionary;otherwise, add it to the manual og.11.
Repeat steps 8 and 10 until the human tag-ger finds no error in the POS-tagged ocu-ment.Figure 3 shows the Tagging Workbench.1017editorFigure 2: The Structure of Proposed Environment~e~l~l  ~ '1~t :~ ~tt~c,.~,,,ca ~.~ ............................ : "~.

The correction log of one documentaffects the tagging knowledge base.
Then, thenext tagging process is automatically improved.In the experimental result, error eliminationrates are evaluated.The result of experiment is in Figure 4.
InFigure 4, automatic orrection means the rightcorrection made by error detection using ruleand manual correction log.
Manual correctionmeans the correction made directly by user.
Wecan see that the rate of automatic orrectionincreased, while that of manual correction de-Figure 4: Comparison between automatic andmanual correctioncreased.We can correct about 7% of total errors byresolving unknown words.
With the increasingnumber of entries, the probability of unknownword occurrence will decrease.6 Conc lus ionAs the researches on the basis of corpus havebecome more important, constructing large an-notated corpus is a more important ask thanever before.
In general, constructing processof POS-tagged corpus consists of morphological1018analysis, automatic tagging and manual correc-tion.
But, manual error correction step requiresa large amount of costs.This paper proposed an environment to re-duce the cost of correcting errors.
In the mor-phological analysis process, we have eliminatedthe errors of unknown words, and find errorswith error correction rules and manual correc-tion log, suggesting the candidate words.
Userscan describe rror correction rule easily by sim-plifying the format of error rule.
As a result ofexperiment, about 63.2% of tagging errors werecorrected.Our environment needs further enhance-ments.
One is the need of observation on thepattern of errors to make rules so that accuracymay be improved, and the other is the efficientuse of manual ogs; currently we use patternmatching.
More general rules could be foundby expressing the manual logs in other ways.Re ferencesE.
