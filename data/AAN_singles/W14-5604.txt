A Contrastive Study about Ways to SimplifyRuslan Mitkov and Sanja?StajnerResearch Group in Computational LinguisticsResearch Institute of Information and Language ProcessingUniversity of Wolverhampton, UK{R.Mitkov, SanjaStajner}@wlv.ac.ukAbstractSimplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand informa-tion for a whole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, wouldhave difficulty in understanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified.
However, theproduction of simplified texts can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task.
In this paperwe show that the employment of a short list of simple simplification rules could result in textsof comparable readability to those written as a result of applying a long list of more fine-grainedrules.
We also prove that the simplification process based on the short list of simple rules is moretime efficient and consistent.1 RationaleSimplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand information for awhole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, would have difficulty inunderstanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified.
Such users include but are not limited topeople with insufficient knowledge of the language in which the document is written, people with specificlanguage disorders and people with low literacy levels.
However, while the production of simplified textsis certainly an indispensable activity, it often proves to be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task.Various methodologies and simplification strategies have been developed which are often employed byauthors to simplify original texts.
Most methods involve a high number of rules which could result notonly in the simplification task being time-consuming but also in the authors getting confused as to whichrules to apply.
We hypothesise that it is possible to achieve a comparable simplification effect by using asmall set of simple rules similar to the ones used in Controlled Languages which, in addition, enhancesthe productivity and reliability of the simplification process.In order to test our hypothesis we conduct the following experiments.
First, we propose six ControlledLanguage-inspired rules which we believe are simple and easy enough for writers of simplified texts tounderstand and apply.
We then ask two writers to apply these rules to a selection of newswire texts andalso to produce simplified versions of these texts using the 28 rules used in the Simplext project (Saggionet al., 2011).
Both sets of texts are compared in terms of readability.
In both simplification tasks the timeefficiency is assessed and the inter-annotator agreement is evaluated.
In an additional experiment, weseek to investigate the possible effect of familiarisation in simplification.
In this experiment a thirdwriter simplifies a sample of the texts used in the previous experiments by applying each set of rules ina mixed sequence pattern which does not offer any familiarisation nor the advantage of one set of rulesover the other.
Using these samples, three-way inter-annotator agreement is reported.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 outlines related work on simplification rules.Section 3 introduces our proposal for a small set of easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply rules andcontrasts them with the longer and more elaborate rules employed in the Simplext proposal.
Section4 details the experiments conducted in order to validate or refute our hypothesis, and outlines the dataused for the experiments.
Section 5 presents and discusses the results, while the last section of the papersummarises the main conclusions of this study.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

These include the ?Federal Plain Language Guidelines?,?Make it Simple, European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information for people withLearning Disability?, and ?Am I making myself clear?
Mencap?s guidelines for accessible writing?.The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)1developed the first version of the?Federal Plain Language Guidelines?
(PlainLanguage, 2011) in the mid-90s and have revised it everyfew years since then.
Their original idea was to help writers of governmental documents (primarilyregulations) to write in a clear and and simple manner so that the users can: ?find what they need; under-stand what they find; and use what they find to meet their needs.?
(PlainLanguage, 2011).
The ?Make itSimple?
European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information for people with LearningDisability (Freyhoff et al., 1998) were produced by Inclusion Europe2in order to assist writers in devel-oping texts, publications and videos that are more accessible to people with intellectual disabilities andother people who cannot read complex texts, and thus enable those people to be better protected fromdiscrimination and social injustice.
The ?Am I making myself clear??
Mencap?s guidelines for accessi-ble writing (Mencap, 2002) were produced by the UK?s leading organisation working with people witha learning disability.3Their goal is to help in editing and writing accessible material for that specifictarget population.
All of these guidelines are concerned with both verbal content of documents and theirlayout.
As we are interested in text simplification and not in text representation, we will concentrate onlyon the former.
All three guidelines share similar instructions for accessible writing, some of them moredetailed than others.
Table 1 allows us to have a quick overview of intersecting rules suggested by theseguidelines which were intended for slightly different purposes and target audiences.. For example, theyall advise the writer to use active voice instead of passive, use short, simple words and omit unnecessarywords, write short sentences and cover only one main idea per sentence, etc.
However, the ?FederalPlain Language Guidelines?
also instruct writers to use contractions where appropriate, avoid hiddenverbs (i.e.
verbs converted into a noun), and place the main idea before exceptions and conditions, whilethe other two guidelines do not go into many details.
Some of the instructions, e.g.
to use the simplestform of a verb (present and not conditional or future), or to avoid double negatives and exceptions toexceptions, are not present in the Mencap?s guidelines for accessible writing, while they are at the sametime implicitly present in the ?Make it Simple?
guidelines, and explicitly present in the ?Federal PlainLanguage Guidelines?.Karreman et al.
(2007) investigated whether the application of the ?Make it Simple?
guidelines to thewebsite?s content would enhance its usability for users with intellectual disabilities.
Additionally, theyinvestigated whether the application of these guidelines would have a negative effect on users withoutdisabilities, as Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines4state that creation of multiple versions ofthe same website should be avoided whenever possible.
The authors prepared two versions of a website,the original one and the one adapted according to the ?Make it Simple?
guidelines.
These two versionswere then tested for efficiency (searching and reading time) and effectiveness (comprehension) by 40participants, 20 with diagnosed intellectual disabilities and 20 without.
The results demonstrated that theadaptation of the website according to the guidelines enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness for bothgroups of participants.There has been a body of work associated with the development and use of Controlled Languagesfor simplification purposes.
The original idea of developing a Controlled Language arose during the1930s when influential scholars sought to establish a ?minimal?
variety of English, a variety specificallydesigned to make English accessible to and usable by the largest possible number of people worldwide(Arnold et al., 1994).
This variety was called Basic English and one of the central ideas was to usea few hundred general-purpose words only.
Operator verbs were to be used with a set of nouns and1http://www.plainlanguage.gov/2http://inclusion-europe.org/3http://november5th.net/resources/Mencap/Making-Myself-Clear.pdf4http://www.w3.org/WAI/31Rule Simple Clear PlainUse active tense (instead of passive) yes yes yesUse the simplest form of a verb* (yes) yesAvoid hidden verbs (i.e.

and ?Federal Plain Language Guidelines?, respectively; value ?(yes)?

The Controlled Language writing rules included variousrules such as ?Keep it short and simple?
(Keep sentences short, Omit redundant words, Order the parts ofthe sentence logically, Don?t change constructions in mid-sentence, Take care with the logic of and andor) and ?Make it explicit?
(Avoid elliptical constructions, Don?t omit conjunctions or relatives, Adhere tothe PACE dictionary, Avoid strings of nouns, Do not use -ing unless the word appears thus in the PACEdictionary) (Arnold et al., 1994).
The concept of controlled languages evolved and developed further andthey have been regarded as a prerequisite part of successful Machine Translation.
Controlled Languageshave been also employed in a number of critical situations where ambiguity could be a problem.53 Simplification strategies: contrasting two sets of rulesThe Simplext guidelines were written under the Simplext project, with the aim of helping the authors toproduce texts which would be accessible to people with Down syndrome.
They follow the same mainideas as those in ?Make it Simple, European Guidelines for People with Intellectual Disability?
but theyadapt the rules to their specific target population and the Spanish language.
The Simplext guidelinescontain 28 main rules6concerned with the verbal content of documents.
Those rules cover the samemain ideas as our rules (see below), e.g.
to keep sentences short, use only the most frequent words,5The reader is referred to (Kittredge, 2003), (Cardey, 2009) and (Temnikova, 2012) for more details.6The Simplext guidelines actually provide even more sub-rules for most of the main rules, but in this study we use only the28 main rules.32remove redundant words, use a simpler paraphrase if applicable.
However, the Simplext rules are morefine-grained, thus providing several more specific rules instead of our more general rules.
For example,they explicitly instruct the writer to use frequent words, use non-ambiguous words, and not use wordswith more than six syllables whenever it is possible.On the other hand, the six simple rules selected for our study have been inspired from the rules inControlled Languages7.
We conjecture that there is a small set of simple, easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply rules which can be equally efficient in terms of simplicity (readability) and yet their employmentis less time-consuming and less contentious in practice.
The rules which we propose are as follows(examples are presented in Table 2):1.
Use simple sentencesWe have selected this rule to ensure that the simplified version of the document features sufficientlyshort and simple sentences only so that the reader does not have to process longer complex sen-tences.2.
Remove anaphorsThis rules caters for replacing the anaphors such as pronouns and one-anaphors with their antecedentto minimise the risk of anaphoric ambiguity but also makes sure that the texts does not feature anyelliptical constructions which may be more difficult to understand.3.
Use active voice onlyWe have included this rule as active voice is generally easier to process.4.
Use the most frequent words onlySimilarly to the practice recommended in Basic English, we recommend the use of the 1,000 mostfrequent words in Spanish as documented by RAE (Real Academia Espa?nola)8.
If this is not pos-sible, then words from the list of the 5,000 most frequent Spanish words are resorted to9.
We haveallowed the following exception for this rule.
There are cases where a specific technical word occursin the text and which is unlikely to be on the list of 1,000 (or 5,000) basic / most frequent words inSpanish.
By way of example, in the sentence ?Ana Juan gan?o el Premio Nacional de Ilustraci?on de2010?
(Ana Juan won the national prize for illustration in 2010) the word Ilustraci?on is consideredas technical and is not replaced with a basic word.5.
Remove redundant wordsOur rules recommend the removal of redundant words or phrases which do not really contribute tothe understanding of the text.6.
Use a simpler paraphrase, if applicableThere are cases where the sentence is difficult to read or understand due among other things, toits syntax.
Our rules recommend that in such cases the original sentence or part of the sentence isparaphrased.4 Experiments and dataIn order to test our hypothesis we conducted several experiments.
We selected 10 newswire texts inSpanish and asked two writers who are native speakers of Spanish and who have a language/linguisticsbackground, to apply both our six rules and the 28 Simplext rules in order to simplify these newswiretexts.
The writers familiarised themselves with the rules beforehand, had an induction with the authors7We shall often refer to these rules throughout the paper as ?our rules?8http://corpus.rae.es/frec/1000 formas.TXT9http://corpus.rae.es/frec/5000 formas.TXT33Rule Version Example1 Original Desde hace ya 10 a?nos, La Casa Encendida ha propuesto y desarrollado, den-tro del mundo profesional de las Artes Esc?enicas, el Ciclo Artes Esc?enicas yDiscapacidad.

]Table 2: Examples of each of our rules (sentence parts altered by applying the corresponding rule areshown in bold)34of this paper and were asked to have sessions no longer than 1 hour so that potential fatigue did not com-promise the experiments.
In order to minimise potential familiarity effect (texts which already have beensimplified are expected to be simplified faster and more efficiently as they are familiar to the writers),we allowed a few days interval between each time a specific text was simplified using different rules.We applied the Spauldings Spanish Readability index ?
SSR (Spaulding, 1956) as well as the LexicalComplexity index ?
LC (Anula, 2007) to assess the readability of the simplified texts.
Both metrics haveshown a good correlation with the possible reading obstacles for various target populations (?Stajner andSaggion, 2013), and were used for the evaluation of the automatic TS system in Simplext (Drndarevi?c etal., 2013).
We also asked a third writer to simplify samples from the texts used by the first two writerswhich were pre-assessed to be of comparable complexity, with a view to establishing whether familiari-sation has an effect on the output.
The results of these readability experiments are presented in Tables 4and 5 of the following section.
We also recorded the time needed to simplify each text as an indicationof, among other things, ease of use of (and clarity for) each set of rules and its productivity in general;these results are reported in Tables 6 and 7 of the following section.Several experiments were conducted to assess the inter-annotator agreement.
We believe that the inter-annotator agreement is another good indicator as to how straightforward it is to apply a specific set ofsimplification rules and how reliable the simplification process is in general.
We compute the inter-annotator agreement in terms of the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002).
BLEU score is widely used inMT to compare the reference translation with the output of the system (translation hypothesis).
Here weuse the BLEU score to compare the simple sentences produced by one annotator with the correspondingsentences of another annotator.
We measure the inter-annotator agreement for all three pairs of annotators(Table 8).
In addition, we examined how many times each of the rules was selected by each writer whichin our view would be not only a way of accounting for agreement and but also assessing the usefulnessof every rule and how balanced a set of rules is in general.
Tables 9 and 10 report the results of this studyon the texts simplified by all three annotators.While in the above experiments (which involved only two writers) we made sure that there was atleast a few days?
span between applying the different sets of rules on the same text, we felt that the riskof familiarity effect could not be removed completely.
It is expected that a text which has already beensimplified would take less time to be simplified for a second time, even if different rules are applied.Also, as Simplext rules were always applied after our simple rules, we felt that additional experimentswere needed where (i) there would be no risk of familiarisation effect and (ii) the rules were applied in amixed order so that any experience gained from simplification in general cannot serve as unfair advantageto one of the sets of rules.
In an experiment seeking to investigate the possible effect of familiarisationin simplification, a third writer simplified a selection of the texts used in the previous experiments byapplying each set of rules in a mixed sequence pattern which does not offer any familiarisation nor anyadvantage of one set of rules over the other.
In other words, instead of this writer simplifying the sametext twice using different rules, different texts of comparable level of simplicity, informed by the input ofthe first two writers, were selected and simplified.
Based on the results of the time efficiency experiment(Table 6, next section), we chose three pairs (Pair 1, Pair 2 and Pair 3) of texts where for each pair thetexts are deemed to be of comparable complexity.
By way of example, in Pair 1 which consists of Text 1and Text 2, Annotator 1 needed the same time for both texts with Simplext rules, and similar time withour simple rules, Annotator 2 needed the same time with our rules, and similar time with Simplext rules.Pair 2 consists of Text 3 and Text 4 and Pair 3 is made of Text 9 and Text 10 for the same reasons asabove.
The simplification performed by a third writer makes it possible to report readability indices forthe text simplified by the third writer, as well as the time taken to simplify, and three-way agreement.The 10 texts made available by the Spanish news agency Servimedia10belong to one of the fourfollowing domains: international news (Texts 2, 6, and 10), national news (Texts 4 and 8), society (Texts3 and 7), or culture (Texts 1, 5, and 9).

It also reports on a time efficiency experiment whose objective is to identify therules which are less time-consuming to apply.
Next, interannotator agreement in terms of BLEU scoreand selection of rules is discussed and finally, an interpretation of the results of an experiment seeking toestablish any familiarisation effect in simplification is provided.5.1 Readability studyAs can be observed from Table 4, simplification performed by our rules improves the readability oftexts in almost all cases (note the values in column ?original?
with those in columns A-I and A-II forboth indices LC and SSR).
This improvement was statistically significant in terms of both indices whenthe texts were simplified by the second annotator, and in terms of the SSR index when the texts weresimplified by the first annotator (lower readability indices indicate text which is easier to read).11.TextLC SSRoriginal A - I A - II B - I B - II original A - I A - II B - I B - II1 12.00 5.27 6.00 5.57 6.25 183.07 154.67 170.64 147.67 165.702 9.76 12.52 9.20 9.74 8.98 174.66 169.07 159.88 161.76 155.993 12.95 9.19 8.92 9.04 10.10 176.91 161.30 153.78 157.23 154.804 10.74 7.78 7.59 6.53 7.62 179.19 148.27 143.77 133.36 159.265 11.79 7.80 9.57 9.47 9.94 196.94 180.05 182.25 164.50 181.996 7.23 4.83 4.77 2.00 4.63 177.40 153.22 159.99 130.42 162.197 10.23 13.35 8.54 8.29 7.48 175.72 175.11 153.96 137.15 151.348 15.14 12.07 11.75 8.96 11.77 191.13 175.42 168.08 155.17 162.599 12.86 9.93 10.77 8.87 12.08 178.91 160.47 166.74 142.78 171.0810 13.52 13.31 10.48 12.03 12.24 166.91 146.96 140.94 152.58 152.94Table 4: Readability: two readability indices LC and SSR (lower readability indices indicate texts whichare easier to read; I and II refer to the two annotators who simplified all 10 texts; A and B refers to therules which are used: A ?

Simplext)11Statistical significance was measured by the paired t-test in SPSS at a 0.05 level of significance36The differences in readability between the texts written by employing our simplification rules (columnsA-I and A-II) and those written by following the Simplext rules (columns B-I and B-II), were not sta-tistically significant when the simplification was performed by the second annotator, while they weresignificant when the simplification was performed by the first annotator.
When interpreting these results,it is also important to bear in mind that the LC index measures only the lexical complexity of a text,while the SSR index measures general complexity of a text, including both its lexical and its syntacticcomplexity.
We also benefited from the familiarity experiment in which a third annotator was involved,to assess the readability of the simplified versions of the texts of comparable complexity, as produced bythe third additional annotator.
The results, which are reported in Table 5, suggest that in fact the textssimplified by the third annotator with our rules are easier to read.
On the basis of these readability results,it can be concluded that the application of Simplext rules does not necessarily result in a (significantly)simpler version than the one produced by our rules and comparable results are likely to be achieved.5.2 Time efficiency experimentThe results from the time efficiency experiment (Table 6) show that in all cases, the simplification withour rules is done in shorter (or equal) time.
This is also confirmed by the time needed by the thirdannotator in the additional experiment seeking to establish any familiarity effect (Table 7), where textsof comparable complexity simplified by our rules were simplified faster than the texts simplified with theSimplext rules.
In our view, the results of these experiments are indicative not only of the time and costsavings when using our rules but also of our rules being simpler for writers and more straightforward toemploy.Ann.

We regard the frequency of selection of rules as another indicator for the inter-annotator37agreement.

This phenomenon isillustrated in the following example where the annotators used the Simplext rules:Original: ?Esta reforma prev?e que todos los delitos relacionados con la seguridad vial (comoexceso de velocidad o conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol, las drogas, sin carn?e o sin puntos)pueden conllevar el decomiso del veh?

(rules used: 4,16,4,9)[The penal code reform will envisage that all crimes related to road safety could result in lossof the vehicle, although the decision depends on the judge.
]385.4 Familiarisation experimentFrom the above results, it can be seen that the simplified texts written by the third annotator using a mixedpattern indicate clearer preference to our simple rules in terms of better readability, time efficiency andreliability as opposed to the simplified texts written by Annotator 1 and Annotator 2 where the Simplexttexts were applied only at the end.
On the basis of this, we conjecture that this difference may be stronglyconnected with the lingering familiarisation of the annotators when they simplify texts they have alreadysimplified.6 ConclusionsSimplified texts play an important role in providing accessible and easy-to-understand information for awhole range of users who, due to linguistic, developmental or social barriers, would have difficulty inunderstanding materials which are not adapted and/or simplified.
However, the production of simplifiedtexts can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive task.
The results of this study show that a small setof six simple rules, inspired by the concept of Controlled Languages, could produce simplified texts ofcomparable readability to those produced using a long list of more fine-grained rules such as the onesused in the Simplext project.
In addition, the results of this study suggest that our simple rules could bemore time-efficient and reliable.AcknowledgementsWe would like to express our gratitude to Horacio Saggion for his help with the resources.ReferencesA.
