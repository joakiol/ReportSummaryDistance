In natural languages,sentences are usually part of discourse units just aswords are part of sentences.
Anaphora resolutionplays a significant role in discourse analysis forchopping larger discourse units into smaller ones.This process is done for the purpose of betterunderstanding and making easier the furtherprocessing of text by computer.This paper is focused on the discussion ofvarious factors and their optimal order that play animportant role in personal anaphora resolution inUrdu.
Algorithms are developed that resolvespronominal anaphoric devices with 77-80%success rate.1 IntroductionIn written text, cohesion occurs when someelements in a discourse are dependent on othersand that refer to items backward in the text, both inthe spoken or written text (Halliday and Hassan,1976).
Consider the following example(1.1) Shah Rukh Khan is off to one of hisfavorite cities- London, with his family.
Nowhe is looking for another destination, not somuch for holidaying though.
(The News Islamabad: June 2006)(1.2) Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu hasbeen signed for her new film Corporate.
Sheis a single working woman, wants to getsomewhere in life, on her own terms.
(The News Islamabad: June 2006)Cohesion in examples 1.1 and 1.2 is introduceddue to the terms he, his, her, she and interpretationof these references depends upon some precedingterms.
These referring terms are called anaphors oranaphoric devices (ADs).
Halliday and Hassandescribed anaphora as ?cohesion which points backto some previous items?
(Halliday and Hassan,1976).
The ?pointing back?
words or phrases arecalled the anaphors (Halliday and Hassan, 1976)and the entities to which these point are calledantecedents and the procedure of determining theantecedents of  anaphors and subsequentreplacement in some particular discourse is calledanaphora resolution.
According to Halliday andHassan when anaphors are replaced by theircorresponding antecedents, cohesion no moreexists.
Personal anaphoric devices (ADs) are themost widely used variety of ADs in Urdu text.These are further classified as first person, secondperson and third person anaphoric devices.Examples of first person ADs are ??????

]).A lot of work has been done in English for thepurpose of anaphora resolution and various81algorithms have been devised for thispurpose (Aone and Bennette, 1996; Brenan ,Friedman and Pollard, 1987; Ge, Hale andCharniak, 1998; Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein,1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Lappins andLeass, 1994; Mitkov, 1998; Soon, Ng and Lim,1999).
Work has also been done in South AsianLanguages such as Hindi and Malayalam for thepurpose of anaphora resolution (Prasad and Strube,2000; Sobha, 1998).
Prasad and Strube (2000)worked on anaphora resolution in Hindi.
Theirapproach relies on the discourse salience factorsand is primarily inspired by the central idea ofCentering theory (Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein,1995).
Centering theory has also guided thedevelopment of pronoun resolution algorithms,such as the BFP algorithm (Brenan, Friedman andPollard, 1987) and the S-list algorithm developedby Strube (Strube, 1998).
Prasad and Strube (2000)applied these algorithms to the resolution ofpronouns in Hindi texts.
They showed that the BFPalgorithm cannot be successfully implemented forpronoun resolution in Hindi.
They argued thatbetter results can be obtained with an algorithmthat does not use the Centering notions of thebackward-looking center and the centeringtransitions for the computation of pronominalantecedents, such as the S-list algorithm (Prasadand Strube, 2000).
Prasad and Strube used wellestablished approaches for Hindi anaphoraresolution.
Sobha (1998) used knowledge poor rulebased approach for reference resolution in Hindiand Malayalam languages that stands on verylimited syntactic information.
In Urdu languagevery little work has been done on discourse levelespecially in the field of anaphora resolution.Although, most of the anaphoric devices in Urduand Hindi are same but the style and organizationof discourses are bit different that causes thedifference in anaphora resolution.
Kulsoom et alworked on Urdu anaphora resolution but it appearsto be the tip of an iceberg (Kalsoom and Rashida,1993).
Kulsoom et al(1993) only considered themorphological and lexical filters for the resolutionof anaphora in Urdu discourses.
However, thesefilters are not sufficient for Urdu anaphoraresolution.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section-2 describes the factors that play a vital rolein Urdu anaphora resolution.
Section-3 presentsalgorithms, implementation and evaluation for theresolution of personal anaphora; this is followed bythe conclusion.2 Factors that play vital role in Urduanaphora resolutionFactors that can play a very important role in Urduanaphora resolution beside morphological andlexical filters are topicalized structures, subjectpreferences, object preferences, repetitions, sectionheading and distance.
How these factors arehelpful in anaphora resolution in English languagewas worked out by Mitkov (Mitkov, 1998), buttheir role in Urdu discourse for the resolution ofpersonal pronouns is more cherished.
How thesefactors are helpful in the resolution of anaphoricdevices in Urdu is done by Khan et al(Khan, Aliand Aamir, 2006).
Ali et alalso worked on thesefactors for the resolution of demonstrative ADs inUrdu discourse (Ali, Khan and Aamir, 2007).2.1 Morphological and lexical filtersConsider an example in which anaphora isresolved on the basis of morphological filters.??

He was not liked because he used to drinkopenly.
Due to continuous court cases regarding obscenity, he was notliked by gentlemen community.Here the proper noun ????

is followedby certain class of words.3  Implementations and evaluationsAn informal algorithm for the resolution of firstperson anaphoric devices is as follows:1.
Examine the next clause in the discourse.
If noclause exists then finish.2.
If the current clause consists of first personanaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go tostep-1.3.
Access the previous clause.4.
If the current clause consists of sectionheadings, noun phrase followed by certainwords then assign weight to these filters elseassign priority to noun or noun phraseappearing as a subject of the clause.5.
If no subject exists then go to step-3.Similarly, an informal algorithm for theresolution of second person ADs is as follows:1.
Examine the next clause in the discourse.
If noclause exists then finish.2.
If the current clause consists of second personanaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go tostep-1.3.
Access the previous clause.4.
If the current clause consists of topicalizedstructures then assign weight to these filterselse assign priority to noun or noun phraseappearing as an object of the clause.5.
If no object exists then go to step-3.In the same way an informal algorithm for theresolution of third person ADs is as follows:1.
Examine the next clause in the discourse and ifno clause exists then go to step-9.2.
If the current clause consists of third personanaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go tostep 1.3.
Access the previous clause.4.
Apply the lexical and morphological filters toassign the weight to nouns or noun phrases thatfollow the morphological and lexical filters.5.
If current clause consists of section headings ortopicalized structures or noun phrasepreceded / followed by certain class of wordsthen assign the weight of these filters.6.
If current clause consists of   noun or nounphrase as subject and objects (direct, indirect)then assign the weight value for these filters.7.
If the current clause does not consists noun ornoun phrase as subject, object or contains nosection headings, topicalized structures andnoun phrase preceded by certain words then goto step- 3.8.
Find the repetitions of all noun or noun phrasesand increment their corresponding weights foreach repetition.9.
Record the results and FinishAlgorithms are implemented in Visual C++.Implemented algorithm gets the input that isconstructed manually.
For this purpose eachdiscourse is divided into clauses and is stored asUnicode text file for input to anaphora resolution86program.
For better understanding, consider theexample of discourse 2.8 and its division intoclauses.clause(sub( ?????

),vb(sng,msc)).Fig 1Table-1, Table-2 and Table-3 show the orderof weights assigned to various filters for theresolution of first person, second person and thirdperson anaphoric devices.
The implementedalgorithm aims to determine the efficiency in termsof accuracy and reliability of the proposed order offactors.
For this purpose various experiments wereconducted over various text genres.
To evaluate thesuccess rate of every experiment, precision iscalculated as defined below.
The average length ofeach discourse in sentences was 4-6.Precision =   Number of correctly resolved anaphors  /  Number of anaphorsattempted to be resolvedThe results of the three experiments are asfollowsExperiment#  Precision1            78%2         80%3        80%Table-1 shows that in case of first personanaphoric devices the priority has been assigned onthe basis of section heading, noun phrase followedby certain words and then subject.
It means that ifno section heading or noun phrase followed bycertain words are present then the subject in themain or previous clause will be the potentialantecedent for first person anaphoric devices.Similarly, Table-2 for second person anaphoricdevices, exhibits that weights will be assigned indescending order (left ?
right).
It means that theleftmost filter that is topicalized structure will getthe highest weight for second person ADs.Consider the following output (Fig-2) produced byanaphora resolution program, for the resolution ofsecond person anaphoric device ????
in thediscourse 2.4, topicalized structure ???
????
getshigh priority to become the antecedent.Clause     1, SUB ( ???? )
RESTO   (  )  2 ???
???
?Fig 2Again, in case of third person anaphoricdevices weights as shown in Table-3 have beenassigned in descending order (top - bottom).
Itmeans the weight of section heading filter will belarger in value than that of subject filter.
Considera noun or noun phrase which is section heading aswell as a repeated noun and also lexical filterapplies on it.
For this noun or noun phrase all theweights will be summed up.
A noun with highestweight will be given preference to become theantecedent for third person anaphoric device.
Thisis demonstrated by the following output generatedfor discourse (2.8) by our anaphora resolutionsystem.
This discourse contains total 13 clausesfrom 0 ?
12.
Clause 1 contains third personanaphoric device ??
([?s]) that is resolved to?????
??
which is assigned weight 12 on the basisof lexical filter and distance preference, so, ??????
?is ruled out to become the antecedent since itsweight is 1.
Similarly for the third personanaphoric device ?
?, that appears in clause 4,antecedent with highest weight 50 is ???????
.
By thesame token, for the resolution of the first personanaphoric device ????
, preference has been given tothe noun ?????
