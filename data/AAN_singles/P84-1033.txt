A Case Analysis Method Cooperating with ATNGand Its Application to Machine TranslationHitoshi IIDA, Kentaro OGURA and Hirosato NOMURAMusashino Electrical Communication Laboratory, N.T.T.Musashino-shi, Tokyo, 180, JapanAbstractThis paper present a new method for parsingEnglish sentences.
The parser called LUTE-E J  parseris combined with case analysis and ATNG-basedanalysis.
LUTE-E J  parser has two interestingmechanical characteristics.
One  is providing astructured buffer, Structured Constituent Buffer, soas to hold previous fillers for a case structure, insteadof case registers before a verb appears in a sentence.The other is extended HOLD mechanism(in ATN), inwhose use an embedded clause, especially a "be-deleted" clause, is recursively analyzed by caseanalysis.
This parser's features are (1)extracting acase filler, basically as a noun phrase, by ATNG-based analysis, including recursive case analysis, and(2)mixing syntactic and semantic analysis by usingcase frames in case analysis.I.
IntroductionIn a lot of natural language processing includingmachine translation, ATNG-based analysis is a usualmethod, while case analysis is commonly employedfor Japanese language processing.The parserdescribed in this paper consists of two major parts.One  is ATNG-based  analysis for getting caseelements and the other is case-analysis for getting asemantic clause analysis.
LUTE-E J  parser has beenimp lemented  on an exper imenta l  mach inetranslation system LUTE (Language Understander,Translator & Editor) which can translate Englishinto Japanese and vice versa.
LUTE-E J  is theEnglish-to-Japanece version of LUTE.In case analysis, two ways are generally used forparsing.
One way analyzes a sentence from left toright, by using case registers.
Case fillers which filleach case registers are major participants ofconstituents, for example SUBJECT,  OB JECT,PP(Prepositional Phrase)'s and so on, in a sentence.In particular, before a verb appears, at least oneparticipant(the subject) will be registered, forexample, in the AGENT register.The other method has two phases on the analysisprocess ing.
In the f i rst  process ing,  phrases  areextracted as case elements in order to fill the slots of acase frame.
The second is to choose the adequate casee lement  among the extracted phrases for a cer ta incase slot and to continue this process for the otherphrases and the other  case slots.
In th is  method,there are no special actions, i.e.
no register ing beforea verb appears.
(Winograd \[83\] )Eng l i sh  quest ion -answer ing  sys tem PLANES(Waltz \[78\] ) uses a special  k ind  of case f rames,"concept case frames".
By using them, phrases in asentence, which are described by us ing par t i cu la r"subnets" and semantic features (for a plane type andso on), are gathered and an action of a requi rement  (asentence) is constructed.2.
LUTE-E J  Parser2.1.
LUTE-E J  Parser 's DomainThe domain treated by LUTE-E J  parser is whatmight  be cal led a set of "complex  sentences  andcompound sentences".
Let S be an e lement  of this setand let CLAUSE be a simple sentence (which mightinclude an embedded sentence).
Now, i f  MAJOR-CLand MINOR-CL are principal clause and subordinateclause, respectively, S can be written as follows.
(R1} <S > :: = (< MINOR-CL >) < MAJOR-CL >(<MINOR-CL>)(R2) <MAJOR-CL>::= <CLAUSE> / <S>(R3) <MINOR-CL>::= <CONJUNCTION><CLAUSE> (in BNF)The syntactic and semantic structure for aCLAUSE is basically expressed by a case structure.In this expression, the structure can be described byusing case frames.
The described structure impliesthe semantic structure intended by a CLAUSE andmain ly  depending on verb lexical information.Case elements in a CLAUSE are Noun Phrases,object NPs of PPs or some kinds of ADVerbs  withrelation to t imes and locations.
The NP structure isdescribed as follows,(R4) <NP> :: = (<NHD >){ < NP>/NOUN}( < NMP >)/ < Gerund-PH > / < To-infmitive~PH > /That < CLAUSE >154where NHD(Noun HeaDer) is ~premodification" andNMP(Noun Modifier Phrase) is "postmodif ication'.Thus,  NMP is a set inc lud ing  var ious  k inds  ofembedded f in i te  c lauses,  re la t ive  or be -de le tedrelative finite clauses.2.2.
LUTE-EJ  Parser OverviewAfter morphological  analys is  with looking upwords for an input  sentence in the dict ionary,  aninput sentence analysis is begun from left to r ight.Thus, after a verb has been seen, it  makes progress toanalyze a CLAUSE by referr ing to the case framecorresponding to the verb, as each slot in the caseframe is filled with an NP or an object of PP.
A caseslot consists of three elements: one semantic  f i l lercondition slot and two syntactic and semantic markerslots.
Here,  a prepos i t ion is d i rect ly  used as asyntact i c  marker .
Fur thermore ,  four  pseudomarkers ,  ~subject", "object", ~indirect-object" and~complement", are used.
As a semantic marker,  a so-called deep case is used (now, 41 ready for this casesystem).
Then,  LUTE-E J  Parser  ext rac ts  thesemant ic  s t ruc ture  impl ied  in a sentence  (S orCLAUSE) as an event or state instance created froma case frame, which is a class or a prototype.
An NP isparsed by the ATNG-based analysis in order to decidea case slot fi l ler {now, 81 nodes on this ATNG).Next,  the reason why the case ana lys i s  andATNG-based analysis are merged will be stated.
I thas two main points.One po in t  is about  the depth  of embeddedstructures.
For example,  the invest igat ion on thedegree of a CLAUSE complexity resu l ted in thenecessity to handle a high degree of complexity withefficiency.
The NMP structure is also more complex.In part icu lar ,  embedded VPs or ADJPHs  appearrecurs ive ly .
Therefore,  a recurs ive  process  foranalyzing NP is needed.The other point  is about the representat ion ofg rammat ica l  s t ructures .
Grammar  descr ip t ionsshould be easy to read and write.
Representations byusing case frames make rules of any kind for NMPvery simple, describing no NMP contents.In order to deal  with the above two po ints ,combin ing  the case ana lys i s  w i th  ATNG-basedana lys i s  so lves  those  prob lems.
Verba lNMP(VTYPE-NMP)s are dea l t  with by reeurs ivecase-analyzing2.3.
Structured Constituent BufferAs mentioned above, syntactic and semanticstructures are basically derived from a sentence byanalyzing a CLAUSE.
Analysis control depends onthe case f rame,  when the verb  has  been jus tappearing in a CLAUSE.
However unti l  seeing theverb, all of the phrases, which may be noun phraseswith embedded clauses, PPs or ADVs before the verb,must  be held in certain registers or buffers.Here, a new buffer, STRuctured  CONst i tuentBuf fer (STRCONB) ,  is in t roduced to hold thesephrases .
Th is  buf fer  has  sur face  const i tuentsstructure, and consists of specific slots.
There are twoslot types.
One is a reg is ter  to control  Eng l i shana lys is  and the other  is a buffer to hold somementioned-above constituents.
The first type has twoslots ; one is s imi lar to a blackboard and registers thenames of unfilled-slots.
The other stacks the namesof fil led-slots in order of phrase appearance and isused for backtracking in the analysis.
The second slottype involves several kinds of procedures.
One of themain  procedures ,  ~getphrase" ,  ext rac ts  somecandidates for the slot f i l ler from the left side of aCLAUSE.
It  fills the slot with these candidates.
Thisprocedure takes one argument,  which is a constituentmarker,  ~prepositional-phrase", ~noun-phrase" and soon (in practice, using each abbreviation).For  example ,  when the fol lowing sentence isgiven, the evaluation for ~(getphrase 'preph)"in LISPre turns  one symbol  generated  for the  headprepositional phrase, ~n the machine language", anddetermines the slot filler.
(sl) '~In the machine language each basicmachine operation is represented by thenumerica l  code that  invokes it  in thecomputer, and ..... "However, if the argument is ~verb", this procedureonly tells that  the top word of unprocessed CLAUSEis a verb.
At  that  moment, the process of f i l l ing withslots in STRCONB ends.
Then case analysis starts.2.4.
CLAUSE AnalysisAfter seeing a verb in a CLAUSE,  that is, fillingthe verb slot in the STRCONB,  the case analysisstarts.
When the parser control moves on the caseframe, the analyzer falls to work in order to fill thefirst case slot, which is generally one for theconstituent SUBJECT and for the case AGENT orINSTRUMENT,  etc.
in the semantic structure.
Thisfirst slot is special, because the filler has already beenpredicted in the slot for SUBJECT in STRCONB.Therfore, the predicted phrase is tested to determinewhether or not it satisfies the semantic condition ofthe first case slot.
If it is good, the slot is filled with itas a case instance.
The parser control moves to thenext case slot and a candidate phrase for it isextracted from the remainder of the input sentence byinvoking the function ~getphrase" with NP-1.55argument .
This  slot is usua l ly  OB JECT ,  orobligatory prepositional phrase name if the verb isintransitive.
Furthermore, the control moves to thenext case slot to fill i t , i f  the case frame has moreslots, all of which are obligatory case slots.
They aredescribed in a mean ing  slot (whose va lue is ameaning frame) in a case frame, while optional caseslots are united in a special frame.The process to fill the case slots is continuing untilthe end of the case frame.
Then, more than onecandidate for a case structure may be extracted.More than one for an NP extracted by "getphrase"gives many case structures, because of the differencein input remainders.Next, recusive parsing will be mentioned.
Inanalyzing embedded clauses, which are VTYPE-NMPs.
CLAUSE analysis also gets in use of NPsparsing.
It is supported with a new STRCONB.
Theprocedure to call NP analysis is described in the nextsection.
The conceptual d iagram for LUTE-E Janalysis as a recusive CLAUSE is shown in Fig.1.STRUCTURED-CONSTITUENT-BUFFERl <*sub ..... >l L--.

NP AnalysisAn N'P structure is basically described as the rule(R4).
In this paper, NHD structure and the analysisfor it are omitted.
NMP is another  main NPconstituent and will be explained here.NM:P is described in the following form.
(R5) < NMP > : : =<PP> i <PResent-Participle-PHrase> /<PaSt-Participle-PH > / <ADJective-PH> /<INFinitive-PH > / <RELative-PH > /<CARDINAL> <UNIT> <ADJ>If an NMP is represented by any kind of VP orADJ-PH, it is described ina case structure by using acase frame.
That is, VTYPE-NMPs are parsed in thesame way as CLAUSEs.
However, a VTYPE-NMPhas one (or more) structural missing element (a hole)compared with a CLAUSE.
There fore ,complementing them is needed by restoring areducedform to the complete CLAUSE.
Extending "HOLD'-manipulation in ATN makes  it possible.
Thisextension deals with not only relative clauses but alsoVTYPE-NMPs .
That is, the phrases with a "whiz-deletion" in Transformational Grammar  can betreated.
ADJ -PHs  can also be treated.
For example,the following phrase is discussed.
(s2) '~I know an actor suitable for the part.
"In the above case, the deletion of the words, "who is",results in the complete sentence being the aboverepresentation.
The extending HOLD-mm~ipulationholds the antecedent of a CLAUSE with a VTYPE-NMP.
Calling the case analysis recursively, theVTYPE-NMP is parsed by it.
Each VTYPE-NMP hasa specific type, PRP-PH, PSP-PH, INF -PH or ADJ -PH.
Each of them looks for an antecedent, as theobject or the subject: so that each is treated accordingto the procedure to decide the role of the antecedentand the omitting grammatical relation.
Therefore, itis necessary to introduce one "context" representingVTYPE-NMP.
The present extension demands thecontext with the antecedent and calls the caseanalysis.The following structured representation describesa NOUN,  as stated above.
(NOUN(*TYPE ($value (instance)))(*CATEGORY ($value Csemantic-category'))}(*SELF ($value ("entry-name')))(*POS ($value (noun)))(*MEANING ($value ("each-meaning-frame-list")))(*NUMBER ($value ("singular-or-plural")))(*MODIFIERS ($value CNHD-or-NMP-instance-list")))(*MODIFYING ($value Cmodificand")))(*APPOSITION($value ("appositional-phrase-instance")))(*PRE ($value Cprepositional-phrase-instance")))(*COORD ($value ("coordinate-phrase"))))Each word with prefix "*" describes a slot name suchas a case frame has.
However  many slots areprepared for holding pointers to represent a syntacticstructure of an NP.
The value for VTYPE-NMPs*MODIFIERS is a pair of VTYPE-NMPs and anindividual verbal symbol, for example, "(PRP-PHverb*l)".156Complementing NP's structure, an appositionalstructure is introduced.
It is described in*APPOSITION-slot and treated in the same way asNMPs .
Those phrases are discriminated fromanother NMP by a pair of a delimiter ~," and a phraseterminal symbol, or, in particular, by proper nouns.A Coordinate conjunction is another importantstructure for an NP.
There are three kinds ofcoordinates in the present NP  rule.
The first isbetween NPs, the second is NHDs, and the third isNMPs.
The NP representation with that conjunctionis described by an indiv idual  coordinate structure.That is, the conjunction looks like a predicate withany NPs as parameters ,  for example,  (and NP1NP2 ..... NPi).
Therfore, the coordinate structure has"*COORDINATE-OBJECTS" and "*OBJ-CAT'" slot,each of which is f i l led with any ins tanc ia tedNP/NHD/NMP symbol  or any coord inate  type,respectively.Some l inguist ic  heur ist ics are needed to parseNPs, along with extract ing as few inadequate NPs t ructures  as poss ib le .
Severa l  heur i s t i cs  areintroduced into LUTE-EJ parser.
They are shown asfollows.
(1) Heuristics for a compound NP"Getphrase" function value for an NP is the l ist ofcand idates  for an adequate  NP s t ructure .
Thefunction first extracts the longest NP candidate froman input.
In this analysis, its end word is separatedfrom the remainder of the input by some heuristics,(a) The top word in the remainder  is a personalpronoun.
(b) Its end word has a plural form.
(c) Its top is a determiner.These heur is t ics  p revent  the va lue  from hav ingabundant non-semantical structures.
(2) I-Ieuristics by using contextsWhen NP analysis is called when f i l l ing a caseslot, the case-marker's value for it is delivered to N'Panalys is .
This  va lue  is ca l led "syntact i c  localcontext".
I t  is useful in rejecting pronouns, which areungrsmmatica l ly  inflected, by testing the agreementwith the syntactic local context and the subject or theobject.
Another  context  usage is shown below.Assume that  a phrase  conta in ing  a coord inateconjunction '~and", for example, is in a context whichis an object or a complement, and the word next to theconjunct ion is a pronoun.
I f  the pronoun is asubjective case, the conjunction is determined to beone between CLAUSEs.
To the contrary, the pronounbeing a objective case determines the conjunction toconnect an NP with it.
(3) AppositionMany var ious kinds of apposit ions are used intexts.
Most of them are shown by N. Sager \[80\].
Thepreceding appositional structures are used.3.
LUTE-EJ Parser Merits3.1.
A Merit  of Using Case AnalysisIn two sentences, each having different syntacticstructures, there is a problem involved in identifyingeach case by extracting semantic relations between apredicate  and arguments  (NPs, or NPs  hav ingprepositional marks).
LUTE-EJ  case analys is  hassolved this problem by introducing a new case slotwith three components (Section 2.2.).
For case framesin LUTE-E J  ana lys i s  conta in ing  the s lots,  ananalysis result has two features at the same time.One is a surface syntactic structure and the other is asemantic structure in two slots.
Therefore, many caseframes are prepared according to predicate meaningsand case frames are prepared according to predicatemeanings and syntactic sentence patterns, dependingon one predicate (verb).An  analysis example is shown for the samesemantic structure, according to which there arethree different syntactic structures.
These threesentences are as follow (from Marcus \[80\] ).
(s3) "The judge presented the prize to the boy.
"(s4) ~The judge presented the boy with the prize.
"(s5) "The judge presented the boy the prize.
"Three individual structures are obtained for eachsentence and their meaning equivalence for each slotis proved by matching the fillers of case-instances andby doing the same for case-names.Incidentally, a sentence containing anothermeaning of "present" is as follows.
It means "to showor to offer to the sight", for example, in a sentence,(s6) ~l~ney presented the tickets at the gate.
"In this case, the "present" frame must prepare theobligatory "at" case slot.3.2.
An  Effect of Combining Case Analysis withATNG-based AnalysisThe next section shows one application of theLUTE-E J  parser, which is a machine translationsystem.
So, taking the translated sample sentence inSection 4., effective points in parsing are shown inthis section.
The sample sentence is as follows.
(s7) ~In the higher-level progrsmming languagesthe instructions are complex statements, eachequivalent to several machine- languageinstructions, and they refer to memorylocations by names called variables.
"One point is NMP analysis method by recursivecalling for case frame analysis.
In the example, two157NMP phrases are seen.
(a) The phrase which is an adjective phrase andmodifies "each", appositiveto the preceding "statements",(b) The phrase which is a past participle phraseand modifies "names".These phrases are analyzed in the same case frameana lys is ,  except for the phrase delet ion types(depending on VTYPE-NMP) appearing in them.
Thedeleted phrases are the subject part and the objectpart respectively.
Judging from the point of a parsingmechan ism,  extended HOLD-manipu la t iontransports the deleted phrases, "each" and "names",with the contexts to the case frame analysis.The other point is to hold undecided case elementsin STRCONB.
The head PP and the subject in thesentences, for example, are buffering until seeing themain verb.4.
An Application to Machine TranslationOne of the effective applications can be shown bycons ider ing the NMP ana lys i s  with embeddedphrases.
These NMPs are represented by instances ofactions, i.e.
individual  case frames which may behaving an unfil led case slot.
Applying LUTE-EJparser to an automatic machine translation system,there may be a little problem in lacking the case slotsinformation.
The reason is because the lack inginformation can be thought of as being indispensablefor a semantic structure in one language, for examplea target language Japanese, in spite of having themin another languages, for example a source languageEnglish.
The problem is the difference in how tomodify a head noun by an NMP or an embeddedclause.In Japanese, a NOUN is often modified by anembedded clause in the following pattern.
"<predicate's arguments>* <predicate> NOUN"; * representing recursive applicationsTherefore, in Japanese, an NMP phrase representedby a case frame corresponds to an embedded clauseand the verb of the f rame corresponds to thepredicate.A translation example is shown in Fig.2.ReferencesMarcus,  M i tche l l  P., "A Theory  of Syntact i cRecognition for Natural  Language", MIT Press, 1980.Sager, Naomi,  "Natura l  Language In format ionProcessing", Addison-Wesley, 1981.Waltz, David L., "An Engl ish Language Question-Answering System for a Language Relational DataBase", CACM Vol.21, 1978.Winograd, Terry, "Language as a Cognitive Process",Vol.1, Addison-Wesley, 1983.I l n  the  h~gher - leue l  p rogr -am, .
