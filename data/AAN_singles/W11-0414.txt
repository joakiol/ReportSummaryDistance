After conductinga preliminary exploratory study on Tamildiscourse connectives, we show our obser-vations and results of a pilot experimentthat we conducted by annotating a smallportion of our corpus.
Our ultimate goal isto develop a Tamil Discourse RelationBank that will be useful as a resource forfurther research in Tamil discourse.
Fur-thermore, a study of the behavior of dis-course connectives in Tamil will also helpin furthering the cross-linguistic under-standing of discourse connectives.1 IntroductionThe study of discourse structure in natural lan-guage processing has its applications in emergingfields such as coherence evaluation, question an-swering, natural language generation and textualsummarization.
Such a study is possible in a givenhuman language only if there are sufficient dis-course annotated resources available for that lan-guage.
The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is aproject whose goal is to annotate the discourse re-lations holding between events described in a text.The PDTB is a lexically grounded approach wherediscourse relations are anchored in lexical itemswherever they are explicitly realized in the text(Miltsakaki et al 2004, Prasad et al, 2008).
Tofoster cross-linguistic studies in discourse rela-tions, projects similar to the PDTB in discourseannotation were initiated in Czech (Mladov?
et al,2008), Chinese (Xue, 2005), Turkish (Zeyrek andWebber, 2008) and Hindi (Prasad et al, 2008).
Weexplore how the underlying framework and annota-tion guidelines apply to Tamil, a morphologicallyrich, agglutinative, free word order language.In this paper, we present how a corpus of Tamiltexts was created on which we performed our pilotexperiment.
Next, in Section 3 we cover the basicsof the PDTB guidelines that we followed duringour annotation process.
In Section 4, we show var-ious categories of Tamil discourse connectives thatwe identified after a preliminary study on dis-course connectives in Tamil, illustrating each withexamples.
In Section 5, we discuss some interest-ing issues specific to Tamil that we encounteredduring discourse annotation and present the resultsof the pilot experiment that we performed on oursource corpus.
We conclude this paper in Section 6by discussing about challenges that were unique toour work and our plans for the future.2 Source CorpusWe collected Tamil encyclopedia articles from theJune 2008 edition of the Wikipedia static HTMLdumps1.
Elements such as HTML metadata, navi-gational links, etc.
were then removed until onlythe text of the articles remained.
A corpus was thenbuilt by collecting the texts from all the articles inthe dump.
The corpus thus created consists of1 http://static.wikipedia.org/119about 2.2 million words from approximately200,000 sentences.Since the texts used in building the corpus wereall encyclopedia articles featured in the Tamil lan-guage version of Wikipedia, the corpus covers awide variety of topics including arts, culture, biog-raphies, geography, society, history, etc., writtenand edited by volunteers from around the world.3 Penn Discourse Treebank GuidelinesThe PDTB is a resource built on discourse struc-ture in (Webber and Joshi, 1998) where discourseconnectives are treated as discourse-level predi-cates that always take exactly two abstract objectssuch as events, states and propositions as their ar-guments.
We now describe the types of connec-tives and their senses from the PDTB frameworkand provide examples from Tamil sentences.3.1 Annotation ProcessThe process of discourse annotation involves iden-tifying discourse connectives in raw text and thenannotating their arguments and semantics.
Dis-course connectives are identified as being explicit,implicit, AltLex, EntRel or NoRel (Prasad et al2008).
These classes are described in detail in Sec-tion 4.
By convention, annotated explicit connec-tives are underlined and implicit connectives areshown by the marker, ?(Implicit=)?.
As can beseen in example (1), one of the arguments is shownenclosed between {} and the other argument isshown in [].
The AltLex, EntRel or NoRel relationsare shown by underlining, i.e., as ?(AltLex=)?,?(EntRel)?
and ?
(NoRel)?, respectively.
(1) {eN kAl uDaindadaN}Al [eNNAl viLayADamuDiyAdu].?
{My leg broke}, hence [I cannot play].
?3.2 Sense HierarchyThe semantics of discourse relations are termed assenses and are then classified hierarchically usingfour top-level classes ?Comparison?, ?Contingen-cy?, ?Expansion?
and ?Temporal?.
Each class isrefined by its component types and these, in turn,are further refined by the subtype level.It is interesting to note that some connectiveshave multiple senses.
In example (2) the affixed ?um connective carries the sense of type Expan-sion:Conjunction ?also?
whereas in example (3) thesame affix carries the sense of the subtype Contin-gency:Concession ?however?.
(2) {idaN mUlam avar oru nAL pOttiyil oNba-dAyiram OttangaLai kaDanda pattAvadu vIrareNra perumaiyai pettrAr}.
[inda OttangaLaikaDanda mudal teNNAppirikka vIrar eNrasAdaNaiyaiy]um [nigaztiNAr].?
{By this, he became the tenth player to crossnine thousand runs in one-day internationals}.
[He] also [attained the record of becoming thefirst South African player to cross these manyruns].?

?4 Discourse Connectives in TamilTamil is an agglutinative language where mor-phemes are affixed to the roots of individualwords, a trait that it shares with many other Dra-vidian languages and languages like Turkish, Esto-nian and Japanese.
Here, each affix representsinformation such as discourse connective, gender,number, etc.
We now describe how we try to cap-ture various types of Tamil discourse connectivesusing a proposed scheme which is based on theexisting PDTB guidelines proposed by (Prasad etal., 2007).4.1 Explicit Discourse ConnectivesExplicit discourse connectives are lexical itemspresent in text that are used to anchor the discourserelations portrayed by them.
In Tamil, they arefound as affixes to the verb, as in example (4)where the affix -Al conveys the meaning ?so?.
Thisis in a way similar to the simplex subordinators inTurkish, as described in (Zeyrek and Webber,2008).
However, like in English, explicit discourseconnectives are also realized as unbound lexicalitems, as can be seen in example (5) where theword eNavE means ?hence?.120(4) {avaradu uDalnalam sariyillAmaiy}Al [nAngumAdangaL avarAl viLayADa iyalavillai].?
{He was suffering from ill health} so [hecould not play for four months].?
(5)  {tirukkuraL aNaittu madattiNarum paDittupayaNaDaiyum vagaiyil ezudappattuLLadu}.eNavE [innUl palarAl pArAttappaDuginradu].?
{Thirukkural has been written in such a waythat people from all religions can benefit fromit}.
Hence, [this book is praised by many].
?Syntactically, explicit connectives can be coordi-nating conjunctions e.g., alladu (?or?
), subordinat-ing conjunctions e.g., -Al (?so?
), sentential relativese.g., -adaNAl (?because of which?
), particles e.g., -um (?also?)
or adverbials e.g., -pOdu (?just then?
).Explicit connectives also occur as conjoinedconnectives where two or more instances of con-nectives share the same two arguments.
Such con-nectives are annotated as distinct types and areannotated discontinuously, as seen in example (6)where the connectives -um and -um are paired to-gether to share the same arguments.
(6)  {mANavargaLukku sattuNavu aLikkav}um[avargaL sariyAga uDarpayirchi seiyyav]umarasup paLLigaL udava vENDum.
?Government schools should help in {providingnutritious food to the students} and [makingsure they perform physical exercises].4.2 Implicit Discourse ConnectivesImplicit discourse connectives are inserted be-tween adjacent sentence pairs that are not relatedexplicitly by any of the syntactically defined set ofexplicit connectives.
In such a case, we attemptedto infer a discourse relation between the sentencesand a connective expression that best conveys theinferred relation is inserted.
In example (7), theimplicit expression uthAraNamAga (?for example?
)has been inserted as an inferred discourse relationbetween the two sentences.
(7)  {IyOrA iNa makkaLiN moziyil irundu iNruAngilattil vazangum sorkaL uLLaNa}.
(Implic-it=uthAraNamAga) [dingO, vUmErA, vAlabipONra sorkaL IyOravilirindu tONriya sorkaLdAN].?
{There are words that are present in Englishthat originated from the language of the Eorapeople}.
(Implicit= For example) [Dingo,Woomera and Wallaby are words with their or-igins in Eora].
?4.3 AltLex, EntRel and NoRelIn cases where no implicit connective was appro-priately found to be placed between adjacent sen-tence-pairs, we now look at three distinct classes.AltLex relations, as seen in example (8) are dis-course relations where the insertion of an implicitconnective leads to a redundancy in its expressionas the relation is already alternatively lexicalizedby some other expression that cannot be labeled asan explicit connective.
Example (9) shows an En-tRel relation where no discourse relation can beinferred and the second sentence provides furtherdescription of an entity realized in the first sen-tence.
When neither a discourse relation nor entity-based coherence can be inferred between the twoadjacent sentences, it is described as a NoRel,shown in example (10).
(8) {mudalAvadAga mAgim, jOgEshwari,pUrivilla rayil nilayangaLil guNDu vedittadu}.
(AtlLex=idai toDarndu) [mErku rayilvEyiNaNaittu rayilgaLum niruttappaTTaNa].?
{Initially, bombs exploded in Mahim, Joge-shwari and Poorivilla}.
(AltLex=followingthis) [all the trains from the western railwaywere halted].?

{Sachin Tendulkar is considered the bestbatsman in the world}.
(NoRel) [Indian bow-lers are not being given proper coaching].
?1215 Observations and Results5.1 Combined connectivesThere is a paired connective -um ?
-um (?)
thatsometimes expresses an Expansion:Conjunctionrelation between the events where each -um is suf-fixed to the verb that describes each event (see ex-ample (6)).
Also, there is a connective -Al whichusually never occurs more than once and some-times expresses a Contingency:Cause relation be-tween two events.It is interesting to see that in sentences like(11), the -Al combines with the -um ?
-um to ex-press something like a new type of relation.
In theprocess, the -um ?
-um causes the -Al, which isusually not doubled, to become doubled, therebyforming an -Alum ?
-Alum.
We call this specialtype of connectives as combined connectives, asshown in example (11).
(11)  {kirikket viLayADiyad}Alum {uDarpayirciseidad}Alum [sOrvaDaindEN].
?Because {I played cricket} and because {I didexercise} [I am tired].
?5.2 Redundant connectivesThe connective -O ?
-O (?)
that conveys a dubi-tative relation also combines with the -Al connec-tive in a way similar to what was shown in Section5.1 to form the combined connective -AlO ?
-AlO(?
).However, in example (12), alladu, an equiva-lent of the -O ?
-O connective has also occurred inaddition to the combined -AlO ?
-AlO connective.This may be purely redundant, or could serve apurpose to emphasize the dubitative relation ex-pressed by both alladu and -O ?
-O.
(12)  {pOtti samappatt}AlO alladu {muDivu pera-paDAmal pON}AlO [piNvarum muraigaL mU-lam aNigaL tarappaDuttapaDum].
?If {a game is tied} or if {there is no result},[the qualified teams are chosen using the fol-lowing rules].
?5.3 Results of Pilot StudyIn this experiment, we looked at 511 sentencesfrom the corpus mentioned in Section 2 and anno-tated a total of 323 connectives.
Table 1 shows thedistribution of the annotated connectives across thedifferent types such as Explicit, Implicit, EntRel,AltLex and NoRel.ConnectiveTypeCount Count(unique)Count(%)SensesExplicit 269 96 83.3 18Implicit 28 16 8.6 13EntRel 16 - 5.0 -AltLex 8 5 2.5 4NoRel 2 - 0.6 -Table 1: Results of Pilot ExperimentWhile a higher percentage of the connectivesannotated are those of the Explicit type, it can alsobe seen that there is a higher proportion of uniqueconnectives in the Implicit and AltLex types.
Notethat since EntRel and NoRel connectives are notassociated with a sense relation or a lexical item,their counts are left blank.6 Challenges and Future WorkThe agglutinative nature of the Tamil languagerequired a deeper analysis to look into suffixes thatact as discourse connectives in addition to thosethat occur as unbounded lexical items.
We alsofound certain interesting examples that were dis-tinct from those observed during similar approach-es in relatively less morphologically rich languageslike English.While this was a first attempt at creating a dis-course annotated Tamil corpus, we are planning toconduct future work involving multiple annotatorswhich would yield information on annotation met-rics like inter-annotator agreement, for example.Our work and results would also be useful forsimilar approaches in other morphologically richand related South Indian languages such as Mala-yalam, Kannada, Telugu, etc.We will also work on a way in which the dis-course annotations have been performed will helpin augmenting the information provided duringdependency annotations at the sentence-level.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Prof. Aravind Joshi andProf.
