Our research aims at developing such LinguisticDiscovery Assistants by merging hyperdocumcnts, DataBase Management Systems and interpretive adaptiveinterfaces.We have followed a stepwise approach to the idea inthe context of the discovery and learning of lcxicalproperties of Chinese eh,'uacters, by developing severalprototypes.

MOTIVATIONS : C OMPUrER A IDEDDISCOVERY OR LEARNING OF LINGUISTICKNOWLEDGE1.1 A need for making linguistic knowledge accessibleto the user, in Personal MTA current rend in Personal Machine Translation tendstowards opening to the nser the linguistic data that thesystem is operating upon \[1\].
Such 'discoverable'environments should allow some free, self-plmmed, orcoached investigation to users, and provide these in asuitable xpl~matory fonn with a l,'u'ge part of the linguisticmaterial emba)dicd in the personal lingwarc: lexical databases, syntactic patterns or syntactic rules modules,semantic onlrastive aspects, etc.Our work is oriented towards a particular aspect ofsuch 'open lingware': the grasp, evcnlu:dly the learning,by monolinguai writers or editors of a document who areworking in a language they know imperfectly, of thelexical proi',crties of the language to be used.1.2 A new resource different from dictionariesIn the context of lexical properties we may at firstconsider dictionaries to be a straight rcsponsc to such ademand.
They usually require of the user somepremodelled view of the very organic'alton of the lexicaldata, a pragmatic know-how of their legibility, or realmastery in order for the searcher user to perform a sensiblepruning of the available information.
This is particularlytrue with the lexieal properties of the languages we areconcerned with in this project, Chinese and Japanese.Users may experience thc complexity of the processwhen, starting from uncertain or incomplete chunks ofrecollected knowledge, they wish to investigate a word tobe ,'tscertained, a num~ce to be expressed, an ideogram tobe remembered.
Such situations clearly demand areshaping of dictionaries as interactive knowledge bases,and the proposal of components and coopemlive interfaceswlfich could offer altenmte access chemes to lexic~d atab:t~es, or views of them \[11\].Some integrated systems for I)ialogue Based Machine'l'rm~slation i tend to provide the author with the means forinteractive consulting of linguistic facts or rules, forinstance in the context of lexical or syntacticaldisambiguation or indirect pre-editing of contextualsemantic features, specific to the text to be composed.
TheI.IDIA architecture \[2\] and the NAI)IA model \[9\]certainly illustrate this approach.1.3 Discovery Assistants, Cooperative ObservatoriesThe development of interactive nvironments formonolingnal writers leads to modelling new functions fordocumentation, self-documentation, self-learning andmanagement of indivitlualized personal knowledge bases,to bc pooled into opcn encyclopaedic 'discoveryenvironments', pecific components for NLP systems.Such technologies as hyperdocuments, multimedia ndvoiced data bases, adaptive interfaces, and the benefits ofComputer Aided l.earning techniques may merge to offersolutions in the reahn of such 'cooperative obserwttorics'of linguistic knowledge.Our project has a stepwise approach to the idea, in thee:tse of the lexical properties of the Chinese ideograms.2.
PROJECT OUTLINE AND PROTOTYPIN(;SCIIEME2.1 Comlmter Aided Chinese Character l,earningThe work we report here stems from the initialm()delling of an AAOCC systcm (for 'ApprcntissageAssist6 par Ordinatcur des Caract&es Chinois'), intendedto provide motivated users with an adaptive nviromncntfor the atltonomous discovery or rcvicw of characterproperties Idl, with a deliberate restriction to a hanzi /kanji subset of characters.llan-zi simply means Chinese (~aractel, and kan-ji (whichalliterates the Jboner, and means the same in Japatwse) t'~'tw toa small subset of characters that written Japanese almostentirely borlmved from hanzL and fivm the combination of whichJapanese words are derived.
We shall call 'hanzi / kanji' theintersection set, that is the hanzi which also are Japanese kataji.The conceptu:d model of the lcxical data baseschematizes different views and levels of investigation ofthe material.A first alternative lor the user is to explore a language-independent view (Fig.
1) of the characters (intrinsicmoq~ho-semantic properties of the hanzi / kanji, sharedby written Chinese, Japanese and Korean), contrastingwith language-related views (Fig.
2, Fig.
3).These are enriched with groups of other clmracterproperties (phc)nctics, morphological similarities,contextual semantics...), all su'ongly relevant to one oftim three languages of nse --presently, only with thecore of the Chinese instanciation.287Towards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants...

+ ruing: l i feFig 3: Ixmguage-dependent complementary information(Chinese ttomophones) forthe character BRIGItTIn addition, the user may differenliate between twolevels of information: a main view condensingfundamental properties (Fig.
I) and a secondcomplementary view with more advanced lexicalch,'u'acteristics (Fig.
2, Fig.
3).We willingly refer to J.W.
lleisig's work \[7\], whichemphasizes the role of a corpus of predefined mnemoniclabels attached, one to one, to kanji and possibly to somesubcharacter morphological components.
Such mnemonicm,-u-king will supplement the etymology, while enhancingthe user's ~dmaginative memory>> and strongly rehtyingvisual memory.
We also strongly invite the user topersonalize his knowledge ba~, through adding his ownmnemonics or imaginative productions.2.2 Basic functionalitiesThe lexical base initially m(xlelled provides a goodcoverage of character properties \[3\] :using one view of the character base, the user mayexplore language-free morphology (pictogram, strokenumber, overall structural vignette, semantic radical,confusing sinfilarities...) and universal semantics,on the other hand --m~d on the other view-- an authorcan discover language-relevant morphologicalproperties (phonetic component ill its structuralvalency, homographs, positional wtriants forcompound characters, use in composition...),language-tied phonetics (written and voiced pinyin andtone, homophones...), h'ulguage-related s mautics.A very detailed set of structural vignettes (simihu" inspirit to Ilalpern's patterns \[6\]) is proposed with a digitalcoding, and validated over some 1500 kanji in the lleisigprogression.
They may deeply improve le,'u'ner recall ofthe over~dl structure of a character.
We have lor instance,with file grey tint giving the position of the semantic key:bright rising suntea tinyFig 4: l(ramples of structural vignettesSuch patterns may also be invoked by the user for thestudy of compound ohmactors to be derived from a givenkanji, when recalling some particul,'u" structural model.2.3 Multiple prototyping development schenleThe first prototype implemented the conceptmd m<u.lclof the property base as a highly structured hypertext, usingllyperC,'u'd on Macintosh.
We considered this platform ag (~ trade-off between avahmble interaction managementsystem, and a temperate framework for expressing theobject-oriented and reusable view of the base.We then adopted a twofold development scheme, withboth incremental prototyping ill llyperCard, for surfacemultimodal data and for tile interlace fimctional layer ofthe application, and parallel prototyping on differentdevelopment platlk)nrts, to explore different structuringand searching methods for tile character base.Three tracks were experimented to express charactersearch modalities in more relincd interactive ways:first a Data Base Management System approach,flmmgh Iwo varianls: (1) ollject-oricnled modelling oftile base (in tOOl'S on a Xerox workstatioq), (2) arehltional scheme on a standard medium (an Oracleencapsulation i  l lypercard on the Macintosh);(3) various sketches of a knowledge base wereprototyped in F'rolog with a simplified user interface.3.
A D ATA BASE ORIENTED MOI)EL, WITIIFLI~XIBLE EXPORAT1ONThe prototype may here administer different users(learners, didacticians) with data protection, manage astandard static ch,'u'acter properly base, maintain sessionjournMs and user profiles, tracing their work in the base.3.1  Multlcriterial search of Chlnese CharactersThere are two main access chemes to characters.Direct designation is based on a simple selection of thecharacter icons Oil character boards.
The surfaceorganization of file base in character series or lessonsmatches here structural and pedagogical motivationsinitially expressed by a didactician (Fig.
5).2887bwards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants... G. ~tfiotte & F. TcheouMulticriterial search (MCS) allows the user, startingfrom a partial description of the character, fromtentatively diserimiuaut properties lie may recall, torefine or focus his request.
Partially erroneousdemands hould be nmuaged adequately by the system(while suggesting dcfault or alternate detenniuatiousfor dubious prol~)sals, or suppressing irrelevant ones).The elements remembered orew~k~ by the learner areput forward in a criteria array orgimized in 3 lexicalproperty subclitsses: l~teutial characteristics about thcsought character itself, about its semantic key, andabout its phonogr,'unme if it exists (the phonetic markercomponent, very often structurally present).

In the MCS ofcomplex characters, we put some emphasis on usingstructural vignettes and positional morphology aspects.Lolllll~rl 2 / .a  ( ~,4 r :h~raetera or- pr tmtt lv~=t )Fig 5: l)irect character selection(series of characters with the semantic key MAN)Meenhlg:Plnyln:Radlcal ?

'lhe user may collect some of them ti~r later study.
Directobservation of a chmracter, straightaway, is possible too.3.2 Ewdutive surface struCtoration for the base, andflexible session planning facilityIn its surface design, the standard main clmractcr baseis originally segmented ill lessons, or collections,according to lteisig's view of a pedagogical progressionfor a methodical discovery of kanji.On the I)BMS driven prototypes, surfacerecontiguralion of the base is made possible, using in turnIxlth multicriterial search or direct character collecting.It may allow dMacticians to express different views ofthe intrinsic property base, to restructure oh;tractorlessons for pedagogic;fl reasous, to elaborate alternateprogression schemes (involving for instance usefrequency, series with a comnu)n semantic key, serieswith a shared phonogrmnme, ctc).
They arc hereenabled to propose new palettes of 'predcfined lessons'with alternate discovery paradigms or mnem(micsystems related to various linguistic and cultural vicws,on which learners may express preferences its wcll.The learner himself may build and maintain one orseveral personal (sub)bases, or collections: series ofcharacters that he selects using coherent criteria, whichhe plans to explore in future sessions, collectionsreflecting a personal thematic organisatitm of thediscovery, simple reservoirs of characters built by freepicking or rational collecting, through digressive orsystematic navigation in the bitse.
The leluner mighthere express, discover, refine, some personal discovery'customs' according to a cognitive style.Both types of users are thus allowed (with appropriateaccess rights to such restructuriug resources) to enrich filecollection of existing views on the property basE, to editand to reshape predcfiued lessons or collections into'personal lessons'.Along with instant feedback and regular eviewing oftile actual work, the systenl here has some inccmivcs tomore intention-driven, sell'guided learner activity, throughsllort-tern~ session plmming and long-range curricnhmtself-organization.
Case by case spontaneous consultatiouof lexical information is of course still advised.3.3 Observing user activityIn our view such a function is essential on the way It1inteq)reting and rot?lolling user activity.
On one of theprototypes, the tracing resources providcxl a first basisto el~d~)rate ll xiblc, analytic and synthetic feed-backor witness functions for the user-discoverer interface,to build up an infommlion pool about user I)chaviourmid discovery smltegies.While extracting data from file sessions base, we maysketch synthetic session journals, synthetic views on eachcharacter (or character property) for a user or- I~lr all users.3.4 Parallel prototypingThe DBMS view and the MCS (MultiCritcrial Search)were prototyped on diflerent development plat forms.a) an Object Oriented prototyping (LOOPS)A COCOA rclcase of the AAOCC project wasrewritten iu a homogeneous Object-Oriented fi'mne h)r aco~pus of al?
)ut 100 characters.
Results and pcrlonnanceswere quite encouraging, though on this small scale model.b) a classical relational framework (Oracle)Wc also adopttal, on another prototype (CACAO-4), anintegrative scheme merging two functionally specializedenvironments: IlypcrCard fi)r multimodal interactiveIi'out-eud resources, and ml (hacle kernel or mmlagiug thebases and the user queries.
We here aimed at exploringimplementation paradigms for htrgcr scale character bases.The system first configurates entities in an Oracleproperty base, while extracting relevant data from thellyperCard hypcrdocument fields.
At query time,arguments sent from the interface layer will generate SQLrequests.
System response is displayed back to the user,who then collects characters for litter use, or directly picksup n~ded multimedia data on the properties sought.~lhough on a still small scale prototype, the relatioualDBMS scheme cased data security, coherence qualities, aswell as some quautitative devclopmeut aspects.2~9Towards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants... G. Fafiotte & F. Tcheou4.
EXPERT ASSISTANCE TO CItARACTERIDENTIFICATION4.1 Expert System oriented schemesWe prototyped a similar 'scale model' corpus intosmidl knowledge bases (facts, structural aud other propertyrules), providing for deductive and explanatory fnuctious.Data-driven and goal-driven schemes were experimentedin a small Expert Assistant for Character Identification.We try to initiate more interactive multicritcrialsearches, while coupling very discriminant semanticcharacteristics (the meanings of the expected character, ofits semantic or phonetic keys), less selective indexiug(stroke number, pinyin...), with a tentative iconicspecification of structural properties.When efficient criteria ,are missing, we tbiuk such avisual structural recall to be helpful, with or without strongspatial positioning and applied to subcomponents withsemantic or phonetic key functions, through a progressiveopening or refinement of structural vignettes.4.2 Cooperative searchLater the user should be able to express preferencesregarding the prompting profile or the search strategiesadopted by the Discovery Assistant (I)A) in cases ofunderspecified or possibly erroneous queries.
The DAcould group results or hints, in order to prevent over-stepped talkative dialogues.
System explanation, ifactivated, could justify or illustrate side-hints with details.In the Annex example, the user tries to recall ach~waeter ,~ .
, , ,  a morphological tree of which is shownbelow (the semantic keys of the subcomponents beingsquared) ---but he actually knows very little of all this.~ z~a~utbFig 7: A morphological tree for the character ILLUMINATI~A first scenario (see the Annex) exemplifies acooperative dialogue with a beginner user whosespontaneous search strategy will favour visual structuralcharacteristics (with no particular attention here to anyphonetic unit in the churacter).
The I)A repeatedly asks forany semantic recall of another compouent (a mostdiseriminant criterion), but the user decliues, lie istherefore asked and helped to visually refine the overallfinally I :~.
structure, sucessively , ~ then ,In a second scenario, the user soon proposes (atdialogue step 2) a component kmfe ( ~ ),which he figuresto be present - -and which really belongs to theinvestigated character.
With the current kauji base, addingthis very discriminant element directly produces theunique final solution: to illuminate.In a third scenario, the user erroneously recalls (at step2) the possible presence of the radical strengh, ( ~ ),instead of the very similar knife radical.
The system willfirst exhibit ,an empty respond, which is correct here.
Butknowing about this misleading similarity (a 'faux ,'mils'property), it then suggests chm~giug strength into knife.
Ifthe user acknowledges the proposal, the proper characterto illuminate is reached right away.5.
A PROSPECTIVE VIEW5.1 Functional development methodologyIn the context of our prototyping effort, we would likeideally to design the application with a three-foldfunctional architecture:a highly interactive interface layer developed on anappropriate authoriug environment, for tile surfacemultim(xlal representation f the lcxical o:owlege,,an object oriented DBMS to express the core of thestructural knowledge, to implement efficieutly heavydata searching and to structure and update the userhistory profiles mid personid bases,a declarative or deductive progriunming environmentor expert system generator, in order to express both thestrategy m(xlels of a coached or error-compensatorymulticritcrial character search, and first elementstowards typed behavioural profiles and users'discovery strategies.This could possit)ly lead to 'client-server' m'chitectureswith distributed logical resources in the way of 'white-board' schemes \[8\].
lit seems that the iutcropcrabilityexpected from multiplatform developmeut cnviroucmcntswill further such luuctionally distributed esign.5.2 Cooperative adaptive accompanying interfaceTo summarize, we intend to develop the first draft ofthe exploration assistant, owardsfree surface resUucturing by the leander of his personalkuowledge base, according to a thematic ormethodologic:d view he lkdlows,personal management---plauniug, monitoring andreviewing-- of sessions or iuquiry sequences,synthetic or analytical follow-up of the discovery,working on a metaphor of the subbase bciug explored,with qualitative indicators on the actual navigation,productiou (according to user preferences) of sessionjournals, profile status, global cun'iculum surveys,issuing of persoualized written, magnetic or audiodocuments, for remediation and iu-depth work.5.3 Towards integrated polymorphic or multiple-viewLexical Knowledge BasesOur system can be viewed as a facet of a broader'environment for an encyclop:edic discovery' with othermcxles of activity: sell-review, semi-tutored lessons, wherecharacter thematic 'collections' would drive the discovery.It would be desirable to be able to find, througbdifferent views, in one and the same knowledge base,all the information that the I Ialperu Japanese-Englishdictionary \[7\] offers, with the words built fromclmraeters, Japanese pronunciation, a sound thesaun~s,the data of a large 'Chiuesc-usual language' dictionary,character etymology \[10\], classical, usual calligrapby,a language-independent view of the hanzi / kanji,angmented with a progressive and comprehensiveproposal of mnemonics in lteisig's style \[7\], butculturally related to tile user's native or usual language,the resources and mod:dities modelled in the AAOCCprototypes, for accompanied hyperdocumentalnavigation, expert character identification, for thecreation and updating of pe~onal subbases or thematiccharacter collections, among other features to appear.2907bwards linguistic knowledge discovery assistants... G. 1,'~ffi'otte & 1': TcheottCONCLUSIONWe advocate the development tff system componentslot helping authors to access the underlying liuguisticknowledge, mnong others in l:'ei~onal or DBMT systems.Such Discovery Assistants (DA) slmuld certainly behighly cooperative, namely show sensible interactivity(within multimodal hyperdocuments and object I)BMSframeworks), provide some ways to tentatively adapt tousers' nmemouic and cognitive customs, and preleralflyfirst be user-tunable: i.e.
they could offer means for theusers themselves to refine and express their prcli:rences interms of search strategies (Slmnlaneous, elf-phmned orcoached), their planning intentions for a workingsequence, as well ~ts means for an efficient follow-up oftheir activity.
DAs should in our view rather first enhanceImth user's natural intelligence towards more reflecliveinteractitm (ules, and user's self-gui&mce aptitudes.Iu the framework of a lexical PrOlverty base of hanzi /kanji, we have developed, as very first steps, .
't multipleprototyping of  such functions, while exphMng objectorienled, relalional, aud dcduclive (rule-driven) schemes.We expect progress from patient observation andmodelling or user activity, and from the availalfility ofmult iplatform sol'tw~tre development ools, mergingdi f ferent c lasses of  functionals,  heading lowardsIxflymoqflfic or multiple-view knowledge bases.R lgFERENCES\[1\] Boltet Ch.
