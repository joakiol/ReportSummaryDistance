Krasnaya 6650043 Kemerovo, Russiakerimovrus@mail.ruAbstractThis work presents the tentative version of theprotocol designed for annotation of a Russianmetaphor corpus using the rapid annotationtool BRAT.The first part of the article is devoted to theprocedure of "shallow" annotation in whichmetaphor-related words are identifiedaccording to a slightly modified version of theMIPVU procedure.
The paper presents theresults of two reliability tests and the measuresof inter-annotator agreement obtained in them.Further on, the article gives a brief account ofthe linguistic problems that were encounteredin adapting MIPVU to Russian.
The rest of thefirst part describes the classes of metaphor-related words and the rules of their annotationwith BRAT.
The examples of annotation showhow the visualization functionalities of BRATallow the researcher to describe themultifaceted nature of metaphor related wordsand the complexity of their relations.The second part of the paper speaks about theannotation of conceptual metaphors (the "deep"annotation), where formulations of conceptualmetaphors are inferred from the basic andcontextual meanings of metaphor-related wordsfrom the "shallow" annotation, which isexpected to make the metaphor formulationprocess more controllable.1 IntroductionThe manually annotated Russian-languagemetaphor corpus is an ongoing project in its initialstage, in which a group of native Russian expertsaims to annotate a corpus of contemporary Russiantexts.The annotation is performed at the two levels:1) shallow annotation ?
identification ofmetaphor-related words according to a slightlymodified version of MIPVU, the procedure forlinguistic metaphor identification (Steen et al2010);2) deep annotation ?
identification of cross-domain mappings and formulation of conceptualmetaphors on the basis of basic and contextualmeanings of metaphor-related words.The annotations are visualized with the BRATannotation tool (http://brat.nlplab.org/, Stenetorp etal., 2012).2.
Shallow annotationThe shallow annotation, based on the MIPVUprocedure for linguistic metaphor identification(Steen et al 2010), consists in indentifying andannotating all metaphor-related words in thecorpus.2.1 MIPVU procedureIn MIPVU, metaphor-related words are thewords whose contextual meanings are opposed totheir basic meanings.The basic meaning of a word is:a) more concrete; what it evokes is easier toimagine, see, hear, feel, smell and taste;b) related to bodily action;c) more precise (as opposed to vague) (ibid.
).77Reliability Test1:4 texts,3 annotatorsReliability Test2:4 texts,3 annotatorsFleiss' kappa:acceptedreliableminimumVU AmsterdamMetaphorCorpus:4 texts,4 annotatorsVU AmsterdamMetaphorCorpus:3 texts,4 annotators0.68 0.90 0.7 0.85-0.86 0.88Table 1.
Inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) in Reliability Tests 1 and 2The contextual meaning of a word is themeaning observed in a given context.Annotators establish the basic and the contextualmeaning for each word in the corpus usingdictionary definitions from (Dictionary of theRussian Language, 1981-1984) which is theprimary dictionary, and (Dictionary of the RussianLanguage, 1999) as a subsidiary dictionary.According to MIPVU, a lexical unit is annotatedas a metaphor-related word if its contextualmeaning contrasts with its basic meaning (by thebasis of concreteness, body-relatedness andpreciseness, as described above), and thecontextual and the basic meanings can beunderstood in comparison with each other:CMBM.A lexical unit is not a metaphor-related word ifits contextual meaning is the same as its basicmeaning, or if the contrast by the basis ofconcreteness, body-relatedness and preciseness isnot conspicuous enough: CM=BM.MIPVU does not take into account the historicalaspect, i.e.
it does not differentiate between olderand newer meanings or look into the etymology ofwords, and treats all meanings from the standpointof an average contemporary user of the language(Steen et al 2010).In BRAT annotation tool, the contextual and thebasic meanings of metaphor-related words arerecorded in a special text field which is displayedwhen a viewer hovers the computer mouse over aword.2.2.
Reliability TestsWe have performed two Reliability Tests in orderto 1) to check the transferability and applicabilityof MIPVU, which was originally designed forEnglish, to Russian-language material and 2) toassess the reliability of MIPVU on Russian-language material by measuring the rate of inter-annotator agreement.The Reliability Tests had the following setup:?
3 annotators (PhDs and current PhDstudents with prior experience in conceptualmetaphor studies);?
a collection of 4 text excerpts (500-600words each), representing the 4 genres: fiction,transcribed spoken, popular science/academic, andnews texts;?
POS-tagged files from the NationalRussian Corpus (http://ruscorpora.ru/) in xhtml-format;?
2 dictionaries used to define the wordmeanings: (Dictionary of the Russian Language,1981-1984, Dictionary of the Russian Language,1999).The inter-annotator agreement was measured byFleiss' kappa (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) usingbinary classification, i.e.
1 for any metaphor-related word and 0 for otherwise.
The measure ofFleiss' kappa in Reliability Tests 1 and 2 ispresented in Table 1 in comparison with the similartests done for VUAMC, the VU AmsterdamMetaphor Corpus (Steen et al 2010).In the first Reliability Test, the annotators wereinstructed to follow the basic rules of MIPVU, asdescribed in 2.1.
As seen from Table 1, theresultant agreement was below both the inter-annotator agreement observed on VUAMC and theminimum threshold accepted for Fleiss' kappa.Following Reliability Test 1, we analyzed thecases of disagreement between the annotators, andthe reports from the annotators about thedifficulties they experienced when applyingMIPVU.After that we designed the new version of theMIPVU rules which attempted to address thoseproblems (see 2.3).The second Reliability Test, which was run on anew collection, was annotated according to therevised rules.
As a result, the inter-annotatoragreement significantly improved, exceeding thestatistical threshold for Fleiss' kappa and78outperforming the agreement measures reportedfor VUAMC (see Table 1).2.3.
MIPVU rules: revised and extendedThe analysis of the cases of disagreement and theannotators' problem reports has identified 3 majorgroups of difficulties.
Two of them concerned theapplication of the MIPVU procedure in general,and one group of problems was specific for usingMIPVU with Russian dictionaries on Russiantexts.The first major problem had to do with definingthe basic meanings of words; the annotatorsreported significant difficulties in singling out onebasic meaning from all the available meanings, asrequired by MIPVU.
The solution for this problemsuggests defining a group of basic meanings ratherthan one basic meaning, each of which shares thefeature of concreteness, body-relatedness andpreciseness.
We have also listed the basicmeanings of all major Russian prepositions, asprepositions are reported to account for 38.5-46.9% of metaphor-related words in a corpus(Steen et al 2010) and therefore are essential forinter-annotator agreement.The second issue concerned the treatment ofidioms and proper names, for which MIPVU doesnot offer a comprehensive solution.
In our versionof annotation, we introduced special tags for theseclasses ?
Set Expression and Proper Name (see2.4.6, 2.4.7).The most numerous group of problems dealtwith using Russian dictionaries and adjustingMIPVU to the specific morphological,grammatical, etc.
features of Russian, such as:- In the dictionaries, word meanings are oftendefined through the meanings of words that havethe same morphological root, but belong to adifferent part of speech (deverbal nouns, adjectivalparticiples and adverbs, adverbs formed on thebasis of adverbial participles).- Some of the meanings of imperfecitve verbsare defined on the basis of their perfectivecounterparts.
Some of the meanings of passiveverbs are defined on the basis of their activecounterparts.- Homonymous grammatical forms belonging todifferent parts of speech are listed in one dictionaryentry.- Agglutinative and abbreviated compoundwords (consisting of more than one stem) requireseparate analysis of each of their stems.- Specialist terms and slang words are not listedin general dictionaries.- The best candidate for the basic meaning maybe a stylistically marked meaning of a word.The solutions we offered to address theselinguistic issues of MIPVU adaptation to Russianare described in detail in (Badryzlova et al 2013).2.4.
Classes of metaphor-related words inthe shallow annotationDepending on the type of relation between thecontextual meaning and the basic meaning, theshallow annotation of the Russian metaphor corpusdistinguishes the following classes of metaphor-related words that were present in the originalMIPVU procedure (Steen et al 2010): IndirectMetaphor, borderline cases, or WIDLII (When inDoubt, Leave It In), Implicit Metaphors, DirectMetaphors, Metaphor Flags (mFlag),Personification, and lexical units discarded formetaphor analysis (DFMA).
Additionally, weannotate the classes of Set Expression and ProperName.Importantly, the functionalities provided byBRAT annotation tool allow assigning multipletags to a lexical unit; for example, a word or aphrase can take the tags of Indirect Metaphor andPersonifier/Personified at the same time (e.g.
seethe word "liniya" in Fig.
3); metaphor-relatedannotations can overlap, thus displaying the multi-faceted nature of metaphor-related words and thecomplexity of their relations.2.4.1  Indirect MetaphorIndirect Metaphor is observed when the contextualmeaning of a lexical unit contrasts with its basicmeaning: CM  BM (Steen et al 2010).Figure 1: ?

The visualization functionalities ofBRAT annotation tool have enabled us to regardpersonification as a relation between the twoentities: the source of personification and the targetof personification.The source of personification (Personifier) is alexical unit whose basic meaning implies thepresence of an animate agent.The target of personification (Personified) is alexical unit denoting inanimate subjects,phenomena, or abstract notions onto which thefeatures of an animate agent from the Personifierare mapped.The Personifier and the Personified areconnected by the relation of "Personification".Figure 3: ??????

Direct Metaphor, mFlag2.4.6 Set ExpressionThis class, initially not present in the originalversion of MIPVU, was introduced by us into theshallow annotation as a solution to insufficientguidelines on treatment of idiomatic expressions inMIPVU (see 2.3).The class of Set Expressions includes idiomsand multi-word units as they are listed in thedictionary.
Set Expressions present a special casefor metaphor analysis as semantically inseparableunits with various degree of internal semanticmotivation.
The dictionary definition of a SetExpression in annotation is recorded as itscontextual meaning.Figure 5: ??????

Direct Metaphors inour annotation scheme lie on the borderline of theshallow and the deep annotation, acting as a sourceof cross-domain mapping.Direct Metaphors may be introduced into thecontext either by means of signalling devices(metaphor flags, mFlags), or immediately, withoutany signalling devices (Steen et al2010).Figure 7: ????

[If the life of the wheels flows smoothly likeasphalt on a motorway, a part-time 4-wheel-drivesystem will do.
].The phrase "kak asfalt na avtomagistrali" [likeasphalt on a motorway] is a Direct Metaphorsignalled by the Metaphor Flag (mFlag) "kak"[like].
The Metaphor Flag and the Direct Metaphorit introduces are connected by the relation"Marker".3.
Deep annotationBy deep annotation in our corpus we mean theannotation of conceptual metaphors.We think that the coverage of conceptualmetaphor identification in a corpus and theobjectivity of metaphor formulation can increase tosome extent if these procedures rely on the shallowannotation of metaphor-related words.In a typical study of conceptual metaphor indiscourse, annotators would a) go through a textand mark conceptual mappings, sources and targetswhen they feel there is a shift from one conceptualdomain to another; b) assign the identifiedconceptual structure to a metaphor from apreviously formulated list and label the Source andthe Target; or they would formulate a newmetaphor, Source, and Target, if they were notfound in the list (e.g.
Chudinov, 2001).When we take shallow annotation as the basisfor conceptual metaphor identification, asubstantial component of linguistic intuitionremains, as step (a) basically does not change.However, the coverage is likely to increase,because annotators would examine each metaphor-related word in the shallow annotation and assesstheir potential for triggering a conceptual mapping,which arises from the nature and extent of thecontrast between the basic and the contextualmeanings.The objectivity of assigning conceptualmetaphors to the mappings may also be expectedto increase, because definitions of metaphorswould be based on the dictionary definitions of thebasic and the contextual meanings of metaphor-related words (MRWs).
In our annotation, theinferred conceptual metaphors are recorded in thefield "Possible Inferences" of the "Target" tag.We have described several most frequentscenarios of formulating MRW-based conceptualmetaphors:1) if the Target is a non-metaphor-relatedword, the definition of the Target will be expressedby the contextual meaning of the non-metaphor-related word;2) if the Target is an Indirect Metaphor, thedefinition of the Target will be expressed by thecontextual meaning of the Indirect Metaphor;3) if the Source is an Indirect Metaphor, thedefinition of the Source will be expressed by thebasic meaning of the Indirect Metaphor;4) if either the Source or the Target is aProper Name, the definition of the Source or theTarget will be expressed by the contextualmeaning of the Proper Name;5) if either the Source or the Target is a SetExpression, the definition of the Source or theTarget will be expressed by the contextualmeaning of the Set Expression;6) if the Source is a Direct Metaphor, thedefinition of the Source will be expressed by theDirect Metaphor itself.For example, the noun "liniya" [line] in Figure3, which in itself is an Indirect Metaphor with thecontextual meaning of "Direction or manner ofaction or thought" is the Target for mappings fromthe two Sources.
The first is a participle of the verb"operet'sya" [to lean on smth], which is tagged asan Indirect Metaphor, as:ContextualMeaning"operet'sya"Basic Meaning"operet'sya"?????

[Smth that supportsor holds the weight ofsmth]The following conceptual metaphor can beinferred from these mappings and from theunderlying meanings of metaphor-related words:"Direction/manner of action/thought is somethingthat uses support to lean on or to hold its weight".In some cases, not all the components of aconceptual metaphor may be present explicitly inthe text; this happens when only the Source isexpressed explicitly, while the Target and themapping are implicit.
The Implicit Target may beinferred either from the contextual meanings of themetaphor-related word(s) that express the Source,or from the topical framework of the context.We use the tag "Source implMap" to annotatethe Source of Implicit Mapping.
We also recordthe Implicit Target in a special text field of the"Source implMap" tag, as in Figures 8-9.Figure 8: ??

[But the classicviscous coupling is standing with one foot in thegrave].
"Odnoy nogoy stoit v mogile" [is standingwith one foot in the grave] is a Set Expressionwhose contextual meaning is "To be nearing one'sdeath".
In the given context which speaks about theevolution of automotive technology, this phrasemeans "To come into disuse", which constitutesthe Implicit Target (the Implicit Target is inferredfrom the topic of the context).
The possibleinference from the mapping of the explicit Sourceonto the Implicit Target may be worded as thefollowing: "Coming into disuse is approachingone's death".When making inferences from Source/Targetmappings we have often observed that the first-order inferences that follow immediately from themetaphor-related words of the shallow level maylogically entail further, second-order inferenceswhich are also recorded in the field "PossibleInferences".Figure 9: (?????????

[(Editorial headline) The three stagesof Putin's policy: life support, prostration,revolution.
]"Reanimatsiya" [life support] is a DirectMetaphor with the basic meaning of "Actionsintended to bring a person back to life from clinicaldeath".
At the same time, "reanimatsiya" is theSource of an Implicit Mapping, whose ImplicitTarget is expressed by the topic of the text, where85"life support" refers to Putin's policy during hisfirst presidential term in 2000-2004.
The possiblefirst-order inference from this mapping is: "Putin'spolicy in the early 2000s is life support to Russia".The possible second-order inference is: "Russiaduring the early 2000s is a person in the state ofclinical death".4 ConclusionThe work presented in this paper has shown that:1) Introducing the classes of Set Expression andProper Name has proved to be a viable solutionfor the insufficiency of instructions for idiomsand proper names in the original version ofMIPVU.2) The visualization functionalities of BRATannotation tool allow elaborating and expandingthe structure of Implicit Metaphor (relation"Coreference" to connect the antecedent and theanaphor); of Personification (source ofpersonification (Personifier) connected with thetarget of personification (Personified) by therelation "Personification"); and of DirectMetaphor (Direct Metaphor connected withMetaphor Flag by the relation "Marker").
Cross-domain mappings can be annotated as relationsbetween the Source and the Target.3) BRAT annotation tool enables recording andstoring the basic and the contextual meanings ofmetaphor-related words and the conceptualmetaphors inferred from them.
Implicitconceptual mappings can be annotated, whereonly the Source is expressed explicitly.4) Using multiple overlapping tags and relationsvisualized through BRAT helps reveal thecomplexity of the metaphoric structure of a text.5) The attempt to identify and formulateconceptual metaphors on the basis of the basicand contextual meanings of the underlyingmetaphor-related words tends to lead toincreased coverage and more controlledmetaphor formulation.AcknowledgementsThis work has been funded by the RussianFoundation for Humanities Research/RGNF (GrantNo 12-34-01269).
