Tense, Aspect and the Cognitive Representation of TimeKenneth Man-kam YipArt i f i c ia l  Intelligence LaboratoryMassachusetts Institute of Technology545 Technology SquareCamOridge, MA 02139.ABSTRACTThis paper explores the relationshiDs between acomputational meory of temporal representation (as developed byJames Alien) and a Iormal linguiStiC theory Of tense (as developedby NorOert Hornstem) and aspect.
It aims tO prowde exphcitanswers to four lundamental Questions: (1) what ts thecomputational lustd~cat=on for me or=mmves of a hngu=stIc theory;(2) what ~s the computational explanation of the formalgrammatical constraints; (3) what are the processing constraints~ml3osed on the learnabdity and marKedness of these theoreticalconstruCtS: and (4) what are the constramnts that a hnguist=c theoryimposes or.
representat?ons.
We show that one can effectivelyexploit (n~ ,nterface between the language faculty and thecognmve faculties by using hngu=stic constra,nts tO determinerestrtcuons on tile cognitive representations and wce versa.Three mare results are cbtalned: (1) We derive anexplanation of an oOserved grammabcal constrmnt on tense .. theLinear Order Constraint -- from the reformation monotonic i typroperty  of the constraint propagation algorithm of Allen'stemPoral system: (2) We formulate a principle of mart~edness forthe 13as=c tense structures Ioased on the computational efficiencyof the temporal representations: and (3) We snow Allen'sinterval-Oased temporal System =s not arbitrary, bul it can be usedto exolair, ;nctependently motwated lingulst~c constraints on tenseand aspect interpretatmns.We also claim that the methodology of research developed intins study -- "cross-lever' investigation of independently motivatedformal grammatical theory and computational moclets -.
is a?owerful paradigm with which to attack representational problems=n oaslc cognitive domains, e.g.. space, t~me, c~u:~ality, etc.1.

Each should contribute to the other.The purpose of this loader ~s to work Out an example of howformal grammatical meory and computational models caneffectively constrain eacn  diner s reoresematJons.
In ~3artJcular, Iseek to exolore four !undamental ~ssues:t. How ~s the cho=ce of onmmve structures m grammaticaltheory to be lustified?2.

In sOdoing, I will also restnct the class of plausmle computationalmodels tO those that can exclam or incorporate the constraints=m;3osed by the formal grammatical theory.There are a numoer of requirements that must be met morder for such "cross.lever' study to succeed.
First, there is asizable collection of fzcts and data from the target domain to beexplained.
Second.
there =s ,ndeDendent motwauon for the theoryof grammar .. =t ~s empmca:ly adequate.
And, third, thecomputational model =s also ,nrJeoendently motivated by ioemgsufhc=ently express=re and computatlonally efficient.With these considerations, I have chosen two domains: (1)tense and (2) aspect.
Tense concerns the Chronological orderingOf situations with resnect tO some reference moment, usually themoment of s!3eech.
Aspect =S the study of situation types andperspectives from which a particular situation can be viewed orevaluated (cf.
Comrie75) The point of departure of this study istwo papers: (1) for tl~e theory of tense, Hornstetn's "Towards atheory of Tense" (Homstem77) and (2) tor the cognitive theory oftime.
James Allen's "?Towarcls a General Theory ot Action and18Time" (Allen84).In the following, I shall list the main results of this study:1.2.A better theory of tense with revised primitive tensestructures and constraints.We derive an exDlanatmn of Hornstein's Linear OrderConstraint, an oioserved formal constraint on lingu=stictense, from propert=es of the constraint propagat=onalgorithm of Allen's temporal system.
This shows thisformal grammatical constraint need not be learned at =1.We also show that the rule of R.germanence followsfrom the hypothes=s that only the matrix clause anti tl~esuocategortzaDle SCOMP or VCOMP can introducedistract S and R points.
Finally, we prove that certainboundedness condition on the flow of mformatmon Of agrocassmg system leads d=rectly to the locality properlyof a constraint on secluences of tense.3.

TenseWe begin Dy hrst outhmng Hornstem's theory of tense.
Insect=on 2.1. we describe the 13rtmtt,ves and constramnts on tense ofh~s theory.
In sectzons 2.2 and 2.3. we snow how the 0nmit=vesand constraints can be denved from computat=onalconszderat=ons.2.1 Revcs,ons to Hornstem's  Theory of TenseHornstem develops a theory of tense w#th#n theRe~cnenbachlan framewcrk whtch postulates three- theoreticalentit~es: S (the moment of speech}, R (a relerence point}, and E(the moment of event).
The key ~dea =s that certain linearorOenngs of the three t~me I:}o=nts get grammat=cahz.,~l mid the smxbas=c tenses oi Engl,sh.
1 The following ~s the last of basic tensestrOctures:1.
SIMPLE PAST E,R_S2.
PAST PERFECT E_.R_S3.
SIMPLE PRESENT S,R,E4.
PRESENT PERFECT E_S.R5.
SIMPLE FUTURE S_R,E6.
FUTURE PERFECT S_E~RThe notation here demands some explanation.
Theunderscore symbol "~"  is interpreted as the "less-than" relationamong time points whereas the comma symbol .... stands for the"teas-than-or-eQual-to" relatmn.
As an illustration, the presentperfect tense denotes a situation in winch the moment of speechis either cotemporaneous or precedes the reference point, whilethe moment of event =s strictly before the other two moments.Note that Hornstem also uses the term "assoc=ation" to refer tothe comma symbol ",".Geven the bas=c tense structure for a s=mole tensed sentence,the mterpretat=on of the sentence that arises from the interact=onof tense and time adverbs ~s represented by the modihcatmn of theposit=on of the R or E points to form a new tense structure wh=Chwe call a aermeO lense structu,e.
In two papers (Hornstem77 &Hornstem81), Hornstem proposes three formal constraints thathmlt the class of derived tense structures that can be generatedfrom the bas=c tense structures m SuCh a way as to capture theacceptabd=ty of sentences containing temporal adverbs (e.g.. now,yesterday, tomorrow), temporal connechves (e.g., when.
before,after), and md=rect speech.
In the rest of tins sect=on, I shallexamine the adeouacy of these constraints.2.1.1 L inear Order ConstraintThe Linear Order Constraint (LOC) states that t!~.523-4):(1) The linear order of a clenved tense structure must be the sameas the hnear order of the basic structure.

yes terday .LOC predicts (wrongly) that 5cii is good and 5ciii bad.
4 But LOCgives the wrong prediction only on the assumotmon that the basictense structures are correct.
To account for 5c.
i propose to savethe LOC and change the following SRE assocmatmon with thepresent perfect:PRESENT PERFECT E_R.SWith the modified basic tense structure for present perfect.
LOCwill give the correct analysmS.
5cii =s bad because:romp r rowE__R.S -- E IS~R ( l inear  o rderviolated)5ciii is acceptable since:yes terdayE__R.S -- E IR__S(OK: no new l inear  o rder  and no new comma.
)The questmon that naturally arises at this point ms: Why doesHornstein not choose my prooosed SRE structure for the presentperfect?
The answer, I befieve, will become apparent when weexamine Hornste,n's Second constra, nt,2.1.2 Rule for Temporal ConnectivesThe rule for temporal connectives (RTC) states that(p.539-40):For a sentence of the form Pl.conn-P 2 where "conn" ~s atemporal connectmve such as "when" "before", "after" etc.. lineup the S pomt~ of Pt and F 2, that IS.
wnte the tense structure ofPl and P2' lining uP the S points.
Move R 2 to under R 1, placingE 2 accorc=ngiy to preserve LOC on the bes=c tense structure.It can be easily seen that my proposed tense structure for present3.

A~IO.
in French, IRe I~'e~t moment (Comne76, D.al).perfect does not work with RTC since it produces the wrongpredictions for the following two sentences:\[1 \] "John came when we have arrived.\[2\] John comes when we have arrived.For \[1\] the new analysis is:E.R~S --- E,R~SI IE~R.
S E IR~Swhich does not violate the RTC and hence predicts (wrongly) that\[1 \] =s acceptable.
Similarly, for \[2\], the new analys,s is:S.R,E -- S.R.E .
(v io la tes  RTC)I IE~R.
S EIS,  Rwhich prediCtS (wrongly) that \[2\] is bad.This may explain why Hornstem decides to use E_S,R forthe present perfect because =t can account for {1 } and {2\] with nodifficulty.
However.
I suggest that the correct move snould be toabandon RTC which has an asymmetrical property, I.e., it matterswhether Pl or P2 =s put on top, and does not nave an obwoussemanttc explanatmon.
(See Hornstetn's footnote 20, p.54,.3).
Mysecond proooTw31 is then to replace RTC with a Rule ofR.permanence (RP) stating that:(RP): Both the S and R points of Pl and P2 must be ahgnedwithout any mamp-latmn of the tense structure for P2"Thus sentence \[3l:{3\] .John came when we had arrivecl.~s acceptable because its tense structure does not v=otate RP:E.R__S (OK: S and R po in ts  areE IR I$  a l ready  a l igned)NOW, ~et us reconsider sentences \[1\] and \[2\].
Sentence \[1\] is notacceptable uncler RP and the new tense structure for presentperfect since:E.R._S (v io la tes  RP: r.ne two R'sE IR.S are not aligned)Sentence \[2\] ,s still a problem.
Here I snail maKe my thirdproposal, namely, that tne simple present admits Iwo Ioas~c tensestructures:SIMPLE PRESENT S.R.EandE.R,SGiven this modification, sentence \[2\] will now be acceptable since:E.R,S (S and R po in ts  are a l igned)E~R.
S20To examinethe adeouacy of RP.
letuslook at more examples:\[4\] John has come when i .
"we arr ivedi f .
"we had arrivedi i i .
we arr iveiv, we have arr ivedv.
"we w i l l  arr iveThe corresponding analysisisasfollows:\ [4 ' \ ]  i .
E__R.S (BAD)E. RmSi f .
E__R.S (BAD)E__R__Si i i .
E__R.S (OK)E.R.Siv.
E~R.S (OK)EoR, Sv.
E~R,S (BAD)S~R.EWe can see that the proposed theory correctly predicts all ol thefive cases.
There ts.
however, an apparent counter.example to RPwhich, unlike RTC, is symmetncal, Le., it does not ma~ter which Ofthe Pi's =s put on the top.
Cons=der the following two sentences:\[5\] i .
John wi l l  come when we arr ive.i f .
"John arrives when we wi11 come.RP predicts both 5i and 5if will be unacceptable, but 5i seems tobe good.
It ts examples like 5i and 5if, I believe, that leadHornstem to propose the asymmetrical rule RTC.
But I think thedata are m~slead=ng because =t seems to be an ,diosyncrasy ofEnghsh grammar that 5i =s acceptable.
In French, we have to sayan ecluwatent of "John will come when we wdl arrive" with thetemporal adverb=al expl=c~tly marked with the future tense(Jespersen6~, p.264).
Thus.
the acceptability of sentences like 5ican be explained Oy a !ormc=ple of Economy of Speech allowing usto om=t he future tense of the temporal adverbial if the matrixclause is already marked w~th the tuture tense.2.1.3 Sequences of TenseNow, we clescribe the third and final grammatical constrainton sequences of tense.
Consider the following sentences:\[6\] John said a week ago that Mary(a) w i l l  leave in 3 days.
{b) wouldIn the (a) sentence, the temporal interpretatmn of the embeddedsentence is evaluated w=th respect to the moment of speech.Thus.
for instance, \[6a\] means that Mary's leaving is 3 days alterpresent moment of speech.
On the other hand, the (b) sentencehas the temporal intemretatlon of the embedded sentenceevaluated with respect to the interpretation of the matrix clause,Le., \[6b\] means that Mary's leaving is 4 days before the moment ofspeech.To account for the sequence of tense in reported speeCh,Hornstein proposes the following rule:(SOT): For a sentence of the form "P1 that P2"' assign S 2 withE 1 ?In general, for an n.level embedded sentence, SOT states that:assign S n with En.
1 (Hornslem81, p.140).
With the SOT rule, \[6a\]and \[6b\] will be analyzed as follows:\ [6a ' \ ]  a week agoIEt .R luS  1S2__R2,E 2 ==> E 2 is 3 days\[ a f ter  S Iin three days\[s~'\] a week agoIEI.RI~S lIS2uR2.E 2Iin three days==> E 2 is 4 daysDefore S IThe local property of SOT, Le., linking occurs only betweennth and (n-1)th level, has a n~ce conseouence: ,t ex0tams wny athird level nested sentence like \[7\]:\ [7 \ ]  John said a week ago (a)that  Harry would 0e l ieve  in 3 days (b)that Mary( i )  w i l l  leave for  London in 2 days (c)( i i )  wouldhas only two temporal readings: (1) sn 7(ci).
Mary's leaving is twodays after the moment of speech, and (2) m 7(cii), Mary's leaving Jstwo clays Oetore the moment Of speech.
In part=cular, there ~s nota temporal reading corresponding to the situatmon fn which Mary'sleaving ms hve days before the moment of speech.
We wouldobta,n the th=rd reading if SOT allowed non-local hnking, e.g.,ass=gned S 3 with E 1 .2.2 Explanations of the Formal ConstraintsIn the prewous section, we have examined three formalconstraints on the denvatmn of complex tense structures from theOas,c tense structures: (1) LOC.
(2) RP, and (3) SOT.
NOw, I wantto show how the LOC falls out naturally from the computat=onalpropertms of a temporal reasoning system along the linesuggested by Allen (Allen84, Allen83), and also how the RP andSOT constraints have mtuitwe computat=onal motwation.The bes,s of Allen's comDutat=onal system ts a temporal ogicbased on intervals instead of time points.
The temporal logiccons=stS of seven basic relations and their mveraes (Allen84,D.129, figure 1):21Relation svmbol symbol for  meaninQinverseX Oefore Y < > XXX YYYX equal  Y = = XXXYYYX mee~s Y m mi XXXYYYX over laps  Y o oi  XXXYYYX dur ing  Y d di XXXYYYYYX s tar ts  Y s s i  XXXYYYYX f in i shes  Y f f i  XXXYYYYThe reasoning scheme tsa  form of constraint propagation in anetwork of event nodes hnKed by temporal relat,onsmps.
Forinstance, the situat=on as clescribed in the sentence "John arrivedwhen we came" is represented by the network:A - -  (> < m mi =) --> B \ /(<)~,~ (<1L/NOWwhere A = John's a r r iva l  and B = Our comingThis network means that both event A and event B are before now,the moment of speech, while A can be before, alter ors=multaneous with B.When new temporal relatlonsmos are added, the systemmaintains consistency among events by orooagat,ng the effects ofthe new relatmnsmos wa a TaO/e ol Translt~wty Re/at~onsmps thattells the system how to deduce the set of adm=ss=ble relat=onsmosbetween events A and C given the retatlonsh=ps between A and B,and between B and C. Thus, for instance, Irom the relationships"A during B" and "B < C", the system can deduce "A < C".One orooerty of the constraint propagation algorithmgenerally =s that further mlormatlon only causes removal ofmembers from the set of admissible labels, i.e., teml=oratrelatlonsmDs, between any two old events (Allen83, p.8,35).
NOnew label can De added to the admissible set once it is created.Let us call Ires property of the constraint propagntlon algor, tnmthe Delete Labei Condit=on (DLC).
DLC can be mteroreted as ak=nd of reformation monotonic i ty  condit ion on the temocralrepresentation.Let u5 further restrict Allen's temooral logic to instantaneousintervals.
~.e.. each event corresponds to a single moment of time.The restricted logic has only one or,mitwe relat,on, <, and threectner denved relat,ons: <, >, and >.
There is a straightforward:ranslat=on of Hornstein's SRE notation =nto the networkre=)resenta'Jon, namely, replace each comma symbol "," by < (or>.
witr the event symbols reverse their roles) and eachunderscore symbol "~"  by > (or < with similar a?liustment on theevent symbols).
Thus, a tense structure such as: E_R,S can berepresented as:s -(>)->E(> =) (>)RWith this representation scheme, we can prove the followingtheorem:~1)  DLC- -LOCProofLet A and B range over { S, A1 E } and A = B.
There are fivebas=c types ol violations of the LOC:1.
A_B  - -  B_A2.
A B - ,  A,B3.
A_B  --., B.A4.
A ,B  - -  B,A5.
A,B -., B_AWe can see that each of these cases ~s a v=olatlon of the DLC.
Tospell this out.
we have tt~e following operations on the constraintnetwork corresponding tO the above vlolat=ons of the LOC:f ' .A - (<) - ) 'B  - -A - (>) ->B2 ' .A - (<) ->B - -A .
(< = ).)B3'.A.
(<).>B -- A.
(> = )->B4'.A.
(< = ).>B - -A - t> = )->B5".A.
(< = )->B --A.
(>)->BIn each of these cases, the operation involves the addihon of newmembers to the adm=ss=Dle set.
Th=s =s ruled out Ioy DLC.
Thus,we have the result that if LOC =s wolated, then DLC =s v=olated.
Inother words.
DLC - -  LOC.
5 --IThe second constraint :o be accounted for is the RP whicheffecbvely states that (a) the 50omts of the matrix clause and thetemporal adverb=al must be ~clent=cal.
and (b) the IR !0dints of thematrix clause and the temporal aOverbml must be ~dent=cal.
Onenypothests for th,s rule is that:(H1) Only the matrix clause mtrocluces distract S and R points.in other words, the non-subcate<Jonzable temporal adjuncts donet ado new S and R points.H1 has to be modifieO slightly to taV, e the case of embeddedsentence =nto account, namely,{Revised RP): Only the matrix clause and the subcategorizableSCOMP or VCOMP can introduce d=stinct S and R points.where SCOMP and VCOMP stand for sentent=al complement andS.
The ?om,e~e o~ thss Ihe~n ~' nm true.22verbal complement respectively.
The interesting point is that boththe rewsed RP and the locality property of SOT can be easilyimplemented ,n processing systems which have certainOounoeoness constraint on the phrase structure rules (e.g.,,nformation cannot move across more than one bounding node).To illustrate this.
let us consider the following tense interpretationrules embedded in the phrase structure rules Of theLexlcal-Funct,onal Grammar:S -- NP VP($ S-POINT) = NOWVP - -  V (NP) (ADVP) (S ' )($ S-POINT) ={ (T E-POINT) i f  ($ tense) = PASTNOW 0tnerwiseADVP ~ Adv SS' -- COMPSAdv ~ when(T T-REL) = { <.>.=,m.mi }before(T T-REL) = { > }The S rule introduces anew S point and sets its value to now, TheVP rule has two effects: (I) it does not introduce new S or R pointsfor the temooral adveriolal phrase, thus imohcltly incorporating therevised RP rule, and (2) it looks at the tense of the embeddedsentential comolement, setting the value of its S point to that of theE point of the higher clause if the tense is past, and to now,otherwise.
Thus.
tn th~s way, the second effect accomplishes whatthe SOT rule demands.2.3 Implications for LearningIf the revisions to Hornstem's theory Of tense are correct, thenatural cluest=on to de asked is: FlOW dO speakers attain suchKnowledge?
This Question has two Darts: (1) How do spea~ersacquire the formal constraints on SRE derivation?
and (2) How dospeakers learn to associate the appropriate SRE structures withthe baszC tenses of the language?Let us consider the first sub-Question.
In the case of LOC,we have a neat answer .. the constraint need NOT be learned atall!
We have shown that LOC falls out naturally as a consequenceof the architecture and processing algorithm ot the computationalsystem.
AS regards the constraint RP.
the learner has tO acquiresomething similar to Hr.
But H1 IS a fairly simple hypothes~s thatdoes not seem to require induct=on on extenswe hngmstic data.Finally, as we have shown =n the previous section, theboundeQness of the flow of information ol a orocessmg systemleads directly to ~he locality orooerty of the SOT.
The partTcularlinking of S and E points as stipulated by the SOT, however, is aparameter of the iJnwersal Grammar that has tO be fixed.What about the second sub.question?
How do speake~~earn to pair SRE conhguratlons wllh the basic tenses?
There are24 possible SRE configurations seven of which getgrammat,calized.
Here I want to prooose a principle ofmarKeOness ol SRE structures that has a natural computationalmotivation.Let us recall our restrictive temporal logic of instantaneousinterval with one primitive relation, <, and three derived relations:<, >, and >.
Represent a SRE configuration as follows:S ~ EThe admissible labels are among { <.
< =, >, > = }.
So there arealtogether 64 possible configurations that can be classified intothree types:(1)  Incons is tent  labe l ings  (16) .
e .g .
.S\--( > )-~ E ?
(<) (<)R(2) Labelings that do not constrain the SEgiven the labelings of SR and RE (32), e.g.
:s--( ?
)-.~ E(<) (>)Rl i nk(3) Labelings that are consistent and the SE )inkis c0nstra~ned by the SR and RE \]~nk (16), e.g..s -(<)-> E(<) (<)RIf we assume that labehngs of the third type corresPOnd tO theunmark, ed SRE configurations, the following division of unmarKeOand marked configurations is obtained:UNMARKED MARKEDE~R~SE.
RoSEIR.SE,R.SS,R.ES, RoES~R.ES~RoEPAST PERFECT E~SoRSIMPLE PAST E.SoRPRESENT PERFECT EoS,RSIMPLE PRESENT E.S,RSIMPLE PRESENT S IEoRSIMPLE FUTURE SoE.
RS, EmRS.E.RRoSoERo$.ER~E~SR~E,SR, E~SR.SmER,E.SR.S.EFUTUREPERFECTThere are only eight unmarked tense structurescorresponding to the sixteen SRE netwo~ configurations of type 323because a tense structure can be interpreted by more than onenetwork rebresentations, e.g., the Past Perfect (E_R_S)  has thetollowing two configurations:S--t:>).-* E S- i(> =)--> E(>) .,VI (>) (>)~ ;>)RThe interesting result is that five out of the six basic tenseshave unmarked SRE configurations.
This agrees largely with ourpretheoretlcal intuit=on that the SRE configurations thatcorrespond to the basic tenses should be more "unmarked" thanother possible SRE configurations.
The fit.
however, is not exactbecause the future perfect tense becomes the marked tense inthis classification.Another prediction by this principle of markedneas is thatboth the simple future (S_R.E') and distant luture (S_R_E)  areunmarked.
It would 0e interesting to find out whether there arelanguages =n which the distant tuture actually getsgrammat=calized.The final point tO be made =s about the second type oflabelmgs.
There are two Other possible ways of grouping thelaOehngs: (1) given SR and SE.
those labehngs ~n winch RE ~sconstrained, and (2) given SE and HE.
those in which SR isconstrained.
But these types of grouping are less likely becausethey would yield me s~mple present tense as a marked tense.Thus.
they can be ruleO out iOy relatively few linguistic data.3.
Verb AspectIn cons=clenng the problem of tense, we have restrictedourselves to a subset of Aliens temporal logic, namely, using atemporal structure <:T._<> with hnear oraenng of time points.
TOmake use of the full Dower of Allen's temporal logic, we now turnto the problem of verb aspect.The two mare problems of the study of verb aspect are thecorrect charac!erizat~on of (1) the three funclamental types of verbpredtcatlon according to the situation types that they signify ..state, process and event, and (2) the p(=rspectwes from which asituation ts viewed, or its truth evaluated -- s~mpte or progreSSive.
6in the first part of his paper.
Allen attempts to prowde a formalaccount of *he state/process/even', d~s~mctlon using a temDorallogic.
However.
I beheve that htS charactenzahon fa?ls to capturewelt.Known patterns of tense =mot;cations, and does not make thedistinction ioetween situation types and perspective typesfunclamental to any adequate account of verb aspect.
In the next3ect=on.
I will present some data that an,/ theory of verb aspectmust be able to explain.3.1  Data3.1.1 Tense Impl icat ions1, Statives rarely take the progressive aspect 7 , e.g.,I know the answer.

For verb predications denoting processes, the progressive ofthe verb form entails the perfect form, i.e.,x is V.ing - -  x has V-ed.For instance,John ts walking ---, John has walked.3.
For verb predications denoting events, the progresswe of theverb form entads the negation of the perfect form, Le.,x is V.mg - -  x has not V.ed.For instance,John ~s bumidmg a house ~ John has not budt the house.3.1.2 Sentences containing WhenSentences containing clauses connected by a connectivesuch as "when" have different aspect tnterpretat~ons dependingon the s~tuatlon types and perspective types revolved.\[9\] John laughed when Mary drew a circle.Situation/Per~oechve type:X = process/simple; Y = event/s~mpleInl\[ernretatlon:X can oe before, after or s=multaneous with Y\[10\] ,;ohn was laugnmg when Mary drew a circle,Situation/P~rsoective type:X = orocess/progresswe; Y = event/s=mbleInt~roretatte, n:Y occurs during X.\[11 } ,John was angr'!

- tThis theorem raises the tollow=ng quest=on: Why do somestatlves occur w~th the orogresswe?
I th~nK there are two answers.First, the verb in question may nave a use other than the statweuse (e.g.
"have" is a statJve when tt means "possess=on", and nota s,*atlve when it means "experiencing" as ~n "John =s having agood time tn Paris.")
Second.
the English progressive may have asecond meamng m addit,on to that cnaractenzed by PROG above.A freouent usage of the progresSwe =s to and=care short duration ortemporariness, e.g., m "They are hying m CamDrldge"/"They live=n Cambridge".8.

For processor event, the simple aspect treats U~e situation as aninstantaneous interval even though the situation ~tself may not beinstantaneous.
For state, the simple aspect retains its duration.The progressive aspect essentially views a process or event fromits inter=or, thus requiring a stance in which the situation is anon.instantaneous interval and the admissible temporalrelationship to be the C_ relations, i.e., s, s~, I, f i .d.

ConclusionIn this paper, I nave exam=ned two problems regardinglinguistic semantics: tense and asDect.
Important relationshipsbetween al~s;ract constra,nts governing lingu=st,c behavior and acomputational scheme to reason aDout temporal relationships arediscussed.
In particular, I have shown that certain formalconstraints, such as the Linear Order Constraint on tense, fall outnaturally as a consequence of some computational assumptions.The interesting result =s that this formal constraint need not belearned at all,Another important role of a representation scheme inexplaining phenomena that exist on a entirely different -.
linguustic-- level is illustrated by the formulation of the C-ASPECT constraintto account for ~nterpretatlons of sentences conta,ning temporalconnectwes.The study of linguistic semanhcs also sheds light on arepresentation of tJm~ hy reveahng the fundamental distractionsthat must be made, e.g.. a tensed sentence revolves three distracttime points, and the aspectual interpretations reclu~reinstantaneous/non-instantaneous ~nterval distinction.Acknowledgments; would like to lh:.mk Prof Robert C.
