RALPH D. BEE~.THE FkEQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ENGLISH SYNTAGMSJ.. INTRODUCTIONPeople use language principally as a means of communication,each language community determining the scope of the particularlanguage it uses.
Within the language, various sets and subsets mayexist depending upon regional and social differences.
Most studies ofsuch subsets have been concerned with lexical variations.
In this paper,a methodology is outlined by which the frequency usage of syntacticstructures can be measured for subsets of a language, and for a languageas a whole.In order to establish omogeneity features within a subset, reliance ismade on calculations of chisquare on batches of sentences within thesubset.
Before considering whether or not a more sensitive test shouldbe applied to detect significant differences within and among subsetsof a language, it seemed advisable to determine the frequency distri-bution of syntagms throughout particular genres.
An extension of themethodology to accomplish this objective is described and the resultsfor one type of syntactic structure within one genre are tabulated.
Theseresults indicate that the frequency distribution of syntagms within theselimitations approximates to a Poisson distribution.2.
METHODOLOGYThere are five main steps in the methodology: the isolation ofeach and every syntagm in the corpus of sentences; the assembly ofthe isolated syntagms into a matrix, each row of which contains yn-Acknowledgements.

BEEBEtagms having the same head-character; the comparison, for particularsyntagms, of the frequencies with which the syntagms occur in differentgenres; the record-keeping of the quantities of sentences in whichparticular syntagms occur once, twice,...n times; and the comparisonof those quantities with standard statistical distributions.The first step in the isolation of the syntagms is the transcriptionof the syntactic structure of the sentences into linearized form, prepar-atory to their being used in the computer.A criterion used for the selection of a grammar on which to basethe syntactic structure description was that, for purposes additional tothose required for this investigation, amely the support of remedialEnglish-teaching courses, a manual system of parsing had to be pro-vided for use by other users reasonably familiar with traditionally-accepted terminology.
The methodology was designed to provide ameans whereby comparisons of genres for frequency-usage of syntac-tic structures could be made, so that teaching courses for particulargenres could emphasize the structures most frequendy used in thosegenres.The methodology had to be such that users quite unfamiliar withcomputer techniques could prepare the data in suitable form for feed-ing into the computer, and use prepared programs to obtain the nec-essary results.For the above reasons, a dependency grammar was selected, detailsof which are shown in Figs.

Wiswesser Line NotationThe method for linearizing syntactic trees, such as those showntypically in Fig.
2, was based on the line-formula chemical notationdeveloped by W. J. Wiswesser (W. j. Wlswmsn~, 1954; E. G. SMITH,1968).
The simple rules applying to the Beebe line notation are thatTHE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ENGLISH SYNTAGMS 11Sentence: The policies of the new government supported isolationism.1 N D/ \2 T H/ \3 P N/ \4 T QLinearization: NT-HP-NT-Q/DSNLevel Numbers: 12123234340101NFig.

Typical Linearization of a Sentencestarting from the first character of a sentence group such as the subjectgroup, verb group, or object group, and proceeding from the hftmostpath of the tree, characters are recorded in sequential order until atermination of a branch of the tree is reached.
At that point, a returnto the nearest branching point in the tree is made, recording a dashfor each step retraced from the terminating point o the branching point.The next leftmost path is then followed with the same retracing proc-12 1L~LPH D. BEEBEess until all the paths in the group have been followed to their termina-tions.
A boundary-marker is then inserted in the linearization to markthe boundary between the subject group and the verb group, and theprocedure repeated for the verb group until all the paths in that grouphave similarly been followed.
Another boundary marker is then insert-ed in the linearization, and the next group is then processed until theend of the sentence has been reached.1 N D1 N/ \  I2 T1 H L3<<3 P N (51 N DV1/ \  / \  I4 T1 Q1 T1 G1 M1I5 H/ \6 P N/ \7 Q1 Q1Linearization: NT1-HPoNT1-QIlD1 L3 < < U1-NT1-GIHP-NQ1-Q1---DV1MISNLevel Numbers: 12212323443440112222332344344565677677654323334401Fig.

Typical Linearization of a SentenceThe data is then key-punched in the following sequence: a headercard for the number and title of the batch of sentences; a card for thenatural text of the sentence; a card for the linearization.This data is then fed into the computer, where it is processed bya very simple program which contains the following instructions:read the characters in the linearization one by one, and if the first char-acter is alphabetical, prepare a record string commencing with thenumeral 1.
If the next character in the linearization is also alphabetical,increment this numeral by one and enter the result in the next positionin the record string.
Continue so doing until a dash is met.
For a dash,reduce the numeral by one, and for a group boundary marker, recorda zero.
The effect of this program is to produce for each sentence arecord string of numerals, as shown in Fig.
2, corresponding to thelevel numbers of the nodes in the syntactic tree.THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ENGLISH SYNTAGMS 13The header card, the natural text card, and the linearization cardare then transferred to magnetic tape records together with the numer-ical record string representing the assignment of the levels.
Theserecords are then available for calling upon for processing for the iso-lation of the syntagms.The isolation procedure commences by first drawing the recordsof the linearizations, one at a time, into an array, while at the sametime drawing the corresponding record of level numbers into anotherarray.
Both arrays are then scanned simultaneously under the followingconditions: each character of the linearization is transferred as it isscanned, to a further array, while the level numbers corresponding tothe characters are checked until a number is encountered less in valuethan the number of the first character in the linearization.
The trans-ferred string of characters then represents the syntagm which hasbeen isolated.The scanning process is then repeated starting from the next char-acter in the linearization until the next syntagm has been isolated.The procedure is continued starting from successive characters in thelinearization until all the characters in the linearization have been proc-essed.As they are produced, the isolated syntagms are fed into the appro-priate rows of a matrix, so that each row contains only syntagms havingthe same head character.
Before each syntagm is entered into a row ofthe matrix, the previous entries in that row are scanned to see if a sim-ilar syntagm has already been entered.
Only when there has beenno previous entry of a similar syntagm, is a new syntagm entered inthat row.
If there has been a similar entry, a frequency count adjacentto the entry is incremented by one.Optionally, each new entry can have an additional entry insertedadjacent to it of the dominant node in the syntactic tree.
The depthof the syntagm, calculated by subtracting the level of the head characterfrom the maximum level of the syntagm, isalso entered, as is the length,calculated by adding the number of characters, including dashes, inthe line notation for the syntagm.A control feature is included, which permits the matrix either tobe cleared at the end of a batch, or to stay filled so that syntagms fromsuccessive batches of the same genre can be added, to produce cumula-tive results.Kows of the matrix can be selectively printed.At the end of a run, a summary of the entries in each row of the14 RALPH D. BEEBEmatrix is made.
The type/token ratio is calculated by dividing thenumber of discrete entries by the total number of syntagms in therow.Graphic plotting programs have been written to display scatterdiagrams of length against depth, of quantities of discrete and of to-tal syntagms against quantity of sentences, and of type/token ratiosagainst quantity of sentonces.

Comparisons of quan-tities of syntagms with and without such arrowheads provide measuresof the actual departures from the norms, and thereby provide an evalu-ation of the validity of the norms.
The levels-assignment programcontains a provision for not changing the level when scanning a sub-categorization number or an arrowhead.As each syntagm is isolated and fed into the matrix, a correspondingentry is made in a duplicate matrix, this second entry containing thenumber of times that the syntagm has been found in the one sentence.When the end of the sentence has been reached, there is also enteredat that point in the second matrix an adjacent entry of an incrementin an array at a position corresponding to the number of times thatthe syntagm was found in that sentence.
The second matrix thereforecontains a growing record of the number of sentences in which thesyntagm appears once, twice .... n times.From preliminary investigations, it was found that n rarely exceed-ed ten.
The provision of an array with fourteen elements was thereforeample for the keeping of such records.Usage frequencies extracted from the first matrix can be used asinput data for a chisquare calculation program to ascertain the homo-geneity of usage within a batch of sentences, or to find if there are sig-nificant differences between genres.

RESULTSNo significant differences were found in the relative proportionsof particular syntagms (prepositional phrases, in the cases displayed)among Batches 1-10 of one genre (newspaper editorials), althoughdifferences ignificant at the .05 level were noted among Batches 11-20of the same genre.
When the totals for each group of ten batches werecompared, however, there were no significant differences.Four batches of another genre, Higher School Certificate Exami-nation (University Entrance) Essays, produced no significant differenceswithin the genre, but did produce significant differences at the .01level when compared with tile same number of sentences from theprevious genre.It appears from the results obtained that the frequency usage ofsyntactic structures is a valid criterion of distinctiveness, and can beused as a means of comparing enres.The entries in the second matrix give the frequency distributionof each syntagm within the corpus.
