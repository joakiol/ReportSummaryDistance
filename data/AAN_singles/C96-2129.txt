Atired translator can accidentally skip a sentenceor a paragraph in a large text.
Pressing a wrongkey can cause a word processing system to deleteseveral lines without warning.
Such anomaliescan usnally be detected by carefnl proof-reading.However, price competition is forcing translationbureaus to cut down on this labor-intensive prac-tice.
An automatic method of detecting omissions(:an be a great help in maintaining translationquality.ADOMIT is an algorithm for Automatic Detec-tion of OMissions in Translations.
ADOMIT restson principles of geometry, and uses no linguis-tic information.
This property allows it to dealequally well with omissions that do not correspondto linguistic units, such as might result from word-processing mishaps.
ADOMIT is limited only bythe quality of the available bitext map.The paper begins by describing the geometricproperties of bitext maps.
These properties en-able the Basic Method for detecting omissions.Section 5 suggests how the omission detectiontechnique can be embodied in a translators' tool.The main challenge to perfect omission detectionis noise in bitext maps, which is characterizedin Section 6.
ADOMIT is a more robust varia-tion of the Basic Method.
Section 7 explains howADOMIT filters out some of the noise in bitextmaps.
Section 8 demonstrates AI )OMIT's  perfor-mance aim its value as a quality control tool.2 Bitext MapsAny algorithm for detecting omissions in a trans-lation must use a process of eliminatiorl: It; mustfirst decide which segments of the original texthave corresponding segments in the translation.This decision requires a detailed description ofthe correspondence between units of the origi-nal text; and milts of the translation.
To un(ler-stand such correspondence, think of the originaltext and the translation as a single b i text  (Hatris, 1988).
A description of the correspondencebetween the two halves of the bitext is called ab i text  map.
At least two methods for findingbitext maps have been described in tile literature(Church, 1993; Melamed, 1996).
Both methodsoutput a sequence of corresponding character po-sitions in the two texts.
The novelty of' the omis-sion detection method presented in this paper Diesin analyzing these correspondence points geomet-rically.A text and its translation can form the axes ofa rectangular b i text  space,  as in Figure 1.
Theheight and width of the rectangle correspond tothe lengths of the two texts, in characters.
Thelower leg corner of ttle rectangle represents thetexts' beginnings.
The upper right corner rep-resents the texts' ends.
If we know other cor-responding character positions between the twotexts, we can plot them as points in the bitextspace.
The b i text  map is the real-valued fnnc-lion obtained by interpolating successive pointsin the bitext space.
The bitext map between twotexts that are translations of each other (mutua ltranslations) will be injective (one to one).Bitext maps have another property that iscrucial lbr detecting omissions in translations.There is a very high correlation between thelengths of mutual translations ('p = .991)(Gale & Church, 1991).
This implies that theslope of segments of the bitext map flmction tlne-tuates very little.
The slope of any segment of the764mall will, in probal)ility, be very close tO the ratioof the lengths of l, lm two texts.

Similar errors were discovered intile other half of the "easy" bitext, and in the"hard" bitext, including one omission of Jnorethan 450 characters.
Other segrne.nts appearedin the list For ~ > 150 .
None of the other seg-ments were.
outright omissions or misalignments.Howew'x, all of them corresponded to non-literaltranslations or paraphrases.
For instance, witht = 20 ?, A I)()MI'F discovered an instance of "Whyis the governlnent doing this?"
(;ratlslatcd as"Pourquoi?
"765The hand-aligned bitexts were also used tomeasure ADOMIT's  recall.
The human align-ers marked omissions in the originM transla-tion by 1-0 alignments (Gale & Church, 1991;lsabelle, 1995).
ADOMIT did not; use this in-formation; the algorithm has no notion of a lineof text.
However, a simple cross-check showedthat ADOMIT found all of the omissions.
TheREADME file distributed with the bitcxts ad-mitted that the "human aligners weren?t infalli-ble" and predicted "probably no more than fiveor so" alignment errors.
ADOMIT corroboratedthis prediction by finding exactly five alignmenterrors.
AI )OMIT's  recall on both kinds of er-rors implies that when tile ten troublesome seg-ments were hand-corrected in the "easy" bitext,the result was very likely the world's first noise-free bitext map.5 A Translators' ToolAs any translator knows, many omissions areintentional.
Translations are seldom word forword.
Metaphors and idioms usually cannotbe translated literally; so, paraphrasing is com-mon.
Sometimes, a paraphrased translation isnmch shorter or much longer than the original?Segments of the bitext map that represent suchtranslations will have slope characteristics sin>ilar to omissions, even though the translationsnmy be perfectly valid.
These cases are termedin tended omiss ions  to distinguish them fl:omomission errors.
To be useful, the omission detec-tion algorithm must be able to tell the differencebetween intended and unintended omissions.Fortnnately, the two kinds of omissions havevery different length distributions.
Intendedomissions are seldom longer than a few words,whereas accidental omissions are often on the o fder of a sentence or more.
So, an easy automaticway to separate the accidental omissions from theintended omissions is to sort; all the omitted seg-ments from longest to shortest.
The longer acci-dental omissions will float to the top of the sortedlist;.Translators can search for omissions after theyfinish a translation, just like other writers runspelling checkers, after they finish writing.
Atranslator who wants to correct omission errorscan find them by scanning the sorted list of omit-ted segments Dora the top, and examining the rel-evant regions of the bitext.
Each time the listpoints to an accidental omission, the translator('an make the appropriate correction in the trans-lation.
If the translation is reasonably complete,the accidental omissions will quickly stop appear-ing in the list and the correction process can stop.Only the smallest errors of omission will remain.6 The  Prob lem of  No isy  MapsThe results of l!\]xperiment ~ l  demonstrateADOMI'F's t)otential.
Ilowever, such stellar per-formance is only possible with a nearly per-fect bitext map.
Snch bitext maps rarely existoutside the laboratory; today's 1lest autonmticmethods for finding tlitext maps are far fl'omperfect (Church, 1993; l)agan et ah, 1993;Melamed, 1996).
At least two kinds of map er-rors can interfere with omission detection.
Onekind results in Sl)urious omitted segments, whilethe other hides real omissions.I!
'igure 2 shows how erroneous points in a bitextmap can be indistinguishable from omitted seg-ments.
When such errors occur in the map,/ /"true" bitext map ~ ~ ?erroneous\o'mal ; " "  - - .~-,?
segmentFigure 2: An undeleciable rror in lhe bitea:t map.A real omission could resull in lhe same map pal-lern as lhese erroneous poinls.ADOMIT cannot help but announce an omissionwhere there isn't one.
This kind of map error isthe main obstacle to the algorithru's precision.The other kind of map error is the main obsta-cle to tile algorithm's recall.
A typical manifes-tation is illustrated in Figure 1.
The map pointsin Region O contradict he injective property ofbitext maps.
Most of the points in Region O areprobably noise, because they map many positionson the x-axis to just a few positions on the y-axis.
Such spurious points break up large omittedsegments into seqnences of small ones.
When theomitted segments are sorted by length for presen-tation to the translator, the fragmented omittedsegments will sink to the bottom of the list alongwith segments that correspond to small intendedomissions.
The translator is likely to stop scan-ning the sorted list of omissions before reachingthem.7667 ADOMITA I )OMIT alhwiates the fragmentation problemby finding and ignoring extralleOllS lna t) points.A COul)le of (hefinitions hell) to exl)lMn the tech-nique.

\[\]nfortunately, first drafts oft ra .sh, , io .s  that had bee,, subj.d, ed to (:ar,~r.l ,',~vision were not readily available.
Therefore, theewdual,ion proee.eded by simulation.
The adva, llrage of a simulation was complete control oww thelengths and relative positions of omissions.
Thisis important because the noise in a bitext mapis mort  likely 1,o obscure a short otnissio, dlan along one.767The simulated omissions' lengths were chosento represent he lengths of typical sentences andparagraphs in real texts.
A corpus of 61479Le Monde paragraphs yielded a median Frenchparagraph length of 553 characters.
1had no cor-pus of French sentences, so I estimated the me-dian French sentence length less directly.
A corpusof 43747 Wall ,5'trent Jo,~rnal sentences yielded amedian English sentence length of 126 characters.This number was multiplied by 1.103, the ratio oftext lengths in the "easy" bitext, to yield a me-dian French sentence length of 139.
Of course,the lengths of sentences and paragraphs in othertext genres will vary.
The nledian lengths of sen-tences and paragraphs in this paper are 114 and730 characters, respectively.
Longer omissions arceasier to detect.The placement of silnulated omissions in thetext was governed by the assumption that transla-tors' errors of omission occur independently fl:oInone another.
This assumption implied that itwas reasonable to scatter the simulated omissionsin the text using any meinoryless distribution.Such a distribution simplitied the experimental de-sign, because performance on a fixed number ofomissions in one text would be the same as per-refinance on the same number of omissions cat-tered among multiple texts.
As a result, the bitextmapping algorithm had to be run only once perparameter set, instead of separately for each of the100 omissions in that parameter set.A useflll evaluation of any omission detectionalgorithm must take.
the human factor into ac-count.
A translator is unlikely to slog througha long series of false omissions to make sure thai;there are no more true omissions in the transla-tion.
Several consecutive false onfissions will de-ter the translator from searching any  further.
Onaverage, the more consecutive fMse omissions ittakes for a translator to give up, the more trueomissions they will tind.
Thus, recall is highly cor-related with the amount of patience that a trans-lator has.
Translator patience is one of the inde-pendent w~riables in this experiment, quantified interms of the nmnber of consecutive false omissionsthat the translator will tolerate.Separate evMuations were carried out for theBasic Method and for AI)OMIT, and each methodwas evMuated separately on the two differentomission lengths.
The 2x2 design necessitatedibm: repetitions of the following steps:1.
100 segments of the given length were deletedfrom the 1,?eneh Mf of the bitext.
'Phe posi-tion of each simulated omission was randomlygenerated fl:om a unilbrm distribution, exceptthat, to simplify subsequent evaluation, theomissions were spaced at least 1000 charac-ters apart.2.
A hand-constructed bitext map was usedto tlnd the segments in the English half ofthe bitext that corresponded to the deletedFrench segments.
For the purposes of thesimulation, these English segments erved asthe "true" omitted segments.3.
The SIMI{.
bitext mapping algorithm(Melamed, 1996) was used to find a mapbetween the original English text andthe French text; containing the simulatedomissions.
Note that SIMI{ cnn be used withor without a translation lexicon.
Use of atranslation lexicon results in more accuratebitext maps, which make omission detectioneasier.
However, wide-coverage translationlexicons are rarely awfilable.
+tb make theevMuation more representative, SIMR wasrun without this resource.4.
The bitext map resulting froln Step 3 wasfed into the Basic Method for detectingomissions.
The omitted segments flagged bythe Basic Method were sorted in order of de-creasing length.5.
Each omitted segment in the output fromStep 4 was compared to the list of trueomitted segments from Step 2.
If anyof the true omitted segments overlappedthe flagged omitted segment, the "trueomissions" counter was incremented.
Other-wise, the "false omissions" counter was incre-mented.
An example of the resulting patternof increments i shown in Figure 4.6.
The pattern of increments was further ana-lyzed to find the first point at which the "\['a\]seomissions" counter was incremented 3 timesin a row.
The wflue of the "true on;fissions"counter at that point represented the recallachieved by translators who give up after 3consecutive false omissions.
To measure therecall that would be achieved by more patienttranslators, the "true omissions" counter wasalso recorded at the first occurrence of 4 and5 consecutive false omissions.7.
Steps 1 to 6 were repeated 10 times, in orderto measure 95% confidence intervMs.The low slope angle thresholds used in Section 4are suboptimal in the presence of lna 1) noise, be-cause much of the noise results in segments of verylow slope.
The optimum value t -- 37 o was deter-mined using a separate development bitext.
Witht frozen at the optimum value, recMl was measuredon the corrected "easy" bitext.Figures 5 and 6 plot the mean recall scoresR)r translators with different degrees of patience.A I)OM\]T outperformed the Basic Method by upto 48 percentage points.
AI)OMIT is also morerobust, as indicated by its shorter confidence in-tervals.
Figure 6 shows that ADOMIT can hel l)translators catch more thall 90% of all paragraph-size olnissions, and more than one half of allsentence-size onfissions.7680\[-0<D100 \[ .
