{megumi-o,shouko,matuyosi,matsu}@is.naist.jp{eric,junta-m,inui}@tohoku.ac.jpkoji.murakami@mail.rakuten.co.jpAbstractIn the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, sentence pairs are classified into one of three se-mantic relations: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION or UNKNOWN.
While we find some sentence pairshold full entailments or contradictions, there are a number of pairs that partially entail or contradict oneanother depending on a specific situation.
These partial contradiction sentence pairs contain useful infor-mation for opinion mining and other such tasks, but it is difficult for Internet users to access this knowledgebecause current frameworks do not differentiate between full contradictions and partial contradictions.
Inthis paper, under current approaches to semantic relation recognition, we define a new semantic relationknown as CONFINEMENT in order to recognize this useful information.
This information is classified aseither CONTRADICTION or ENTAILMENT.
We provide a series of semantic templates to recognize CON-FINEMENT relations in Web texts, and then implement a system for recognizing CONFINEMENT betweensentence pairs.
We show that our proposed system can obtains a F-score of 61% for recognizing CON-FINEMENT in Japanese-language Web texts, and it outperforms a baseline which does not use a manuallycompiled list of lexico-syntactic patterns to instantiate the semantic templates.1 IntroductionOn the Internet, there are various kinds of documents, and they often include conflicting opinions ordiffering information on a single topic.
Collecting and organizing this diverse information is an importantpart of multi-document summarization.When searching with a particular query on the Internet, we want information that tells us what otherpeople think about the query: e.g.
do they believe it is true or not; what are the necessary conditionsfor it to apply.
For example, consider the hypothetical search results for the query given in (1).
You getopinion (2a), which supports the query, and opinion (2b) which opposes it.
(1) Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay.
(2) a. Xylitol can prevent tooth decay.b.
Xylitol is not effective at all at preventing tooth decay.A major task in the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge (Giampiccolo et al (2007)) isclassifying the semantic relation between a Text and a Hypothesis into ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION,or UNKNOWN.
Murakami et al (2009) report on the STATEMENT MAP project, the goal of which isto help Internet users evaluate the credibility of information sources by analyzing supporting evidencefrom a variety of viewpoints on their topics of interest and presenting them to users together with thesupporting evidence in a way that makes it clear how they are related.
A variety of techniques have beensuccessfully employed in the RTE Challenge in order to recognize instances of textual entailment.
?Current afflication: Rakuten Institute of Technology215However, as far as we know, there have been no studies on recognizing sentences which specify condi-tions under which a query applies, despite the fact that these relations are useful information for Internetusers.
Such useful sentences are plentiful on the Web.
Consider the following examples of CONTRA-DICTION and ENTAILMENT.
(3) a. Xylitol can not prevent tooth decay if it not at least 50%.b.
The effect of Xylitol on preventing tooth decay is limited.In example (3a), the necessary condition to prevent tooth decay by Xylitol is ?it contains at least fiftypercent Xylitol?.
That condition is expressed by the phrase in bold in (3a).
This sentence informs usersthat if they want to prevent tooth decay, the products they use must contain a certain amount of Xylitol tobe effective.
In example (3b), we obtain information on uncertainty of Xylitol?s tooth decay preventioneffectiveness from the phrase ?is limited?.
It tells that Xylitol is not necessarily effective at preventingtooth decay, and thus it is not completely in agreement with or contradiction to the original sentence (1).It is important to recognize the semantic relation shown in (3) because it provides more specific infor-mation about the query or specifies the conditions under which the statement holds or does not.
This isvaluable information for Internet users and needs to be distinguished from fully contradicting or agreeingopinions.We call this semantic relation CONFINEMENT because it confines the situation under which a queryapplies.
In this paper, we give a language independent definition of the CONFINEMENT relation in pred-icate logic and provide a framework for detecting the relation through a series of semantic templates thattake logical and semantic features as input.
We implement a system that detects CONFINEMENT rela-tions between sentence pairs in Japanese by instantiating the semantic templates using rules and a list oflexico-semantic patterns.
Finally, we conduct empirical evaluation of recognition of the CONFINEMENTrelation between queries and sentences in Japanese-language Web texts.2 Related WorkIn RTE research, only three types of relations are defined: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, andUNKNOWN.
RTE is an important task and has been the target of much research (Szpektor et al (2007);Sammons et al (2009)).
However, none of the previous research has introduced relations correspondingto CONFINEMENT.Cross-document Structure Theory (CST, Radev (2000)) is another approach to recognizing semanticrelations between sentences.
CST is an extended rhetorical structure analysis based on Rhetorical Struc-ture Theory (RST).
It attempts to describe the semantic relations between two or more sentences fromdifferent source documents that are related to the same topic.
It defines 18 kinds of semantic relationsbetween sentences.
Etoh and Okumura (2005) constructed a Japanese Cross-document Relation Corpusand defined 14 kinds of semantic relations.
It is difficult to consider CONFINEMENT relations in theCST categorical semantic relations because it focuses on comparing sentences in terms of equivalenceand difference between sentences.
At first glance, CONFINEMENT may seem to be defined in terms ofdifference between sentences, but this approach does not capture the idea of restriction on a sentence?sapplicability.
Thus, it is beyond the scope of CST.In the field of linguistics, Nakagawa and Mori (1995) discussed restrictions as represented in thefour Japanese subordinate clause patterns.
Abe (1996) researched the role of quantifiers in quantitativerestrictions and the role of ???
(only).?
There is much other researches on expressions representing?confinement?
in a sentence in linguistics.
These expressions are useful in order to recognize phraseswhich contradict each other.
However, as far as we know, there is no research on the relation of CON-FINEMENT between two sentences in the linguistics literature.
The absence of related research makesdefining and recognizing CONFINEMENT a very challenging task.3 The CONFINEMENT RelationWe present the definition of the CONFINEMENT relation and describe its differences from ENTAIL-MENT and CONTRADICTION.
In essence, a pair of sentences is in the CONFINEMENT relation if eitherthe premise or consequent of the second sentence has a certain condition or restriction, and without suchcondition or restriction the pair is equivalent to either ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION.216Consider an example of CONFINEMENT setence pair: (2a) and (3a).
The statement ?it (Xylitol) is not atleast 50%?
is a condition of the statement ?Xylitol can not prevent tooth decay.?
It is a CONTRADICTIONif the conditional statement is satisfied.
Because the truth value of the whole statement depends onvarious conditions to be satisfied, it is important to properly define a framework to define them.3.1 A Logical Definition of CONFINEMENTWe present a definition of CONFINEMENT in predicate logic.
We define CONFINEMENT as a semanticrelation between two sentences, where the first sentence corresponds to RTE?s Hypothesis, or the userQuery, and the second sentence corresponds to RTE?s Text that has some semantic relation with theQuery, which we want to identify.Here we consider sentence pairs where the Query matches the logical pattern ?x(P (x) ?
C(x)),where we call P (x) the Premise and C(x) the Consequence.
There are many ways of representingsentences as logical expressions, and we think that the logical pattern (?
(P (x) ?
C(x))) can cover avariety of queries.
For example, the sentence ?Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay.?
can berepresented as ?x(isXylitol(x) ?
effectiveAtPreventingToothDecay(x)).
Consider the case where onesentence contains only a Consequence.
This case can be regarded as a special case of the above formula.We write such a sentence as ?x(T ?
C(x)) showing that the Premise is always True.In this paper, we limit discussion of the CONFINEMENT relation to the Query matching to the abovelogical pattern.
Recognizing CONFINEMENT between the Text and the Query having more complexsemantic patterns is an area of future work.
Here, we split the definition of CONFINEMENT into subtypesaccording to: (i) conditions to satisfy in addition to the Premise, and (ii) limitations on the degree of theConsequence.Premise side Additional conditions for achieving the ConsequenceExplicit constraintSome conditional sentences use an expression correspoinding to logical ?only if,?
which explicitlymeans two way conditions as the following formula.
?x((P (x) ?AdditionalCondition(x) ?
C(x)) (1)?
(P (x) ?
?AdditionalCondition(x) ?
?C(x)))For example, S1 in Table 1, ?Xylitol is effective at preventing cavities only when it is 100%?,explicitly specify that Xylitol is effective if it is 100% and is not effective if it is not 100%.
So,we assume the form of the above formula for this type of statement.Implicit constraintThis type of sentence specifies an additional condition on the Premise and is represented by thefollowing formula.
The Premise needs to be satisfied for the consequence to be achieved.
?x((P (x) ?AdditionalCondition(x) ?
C(x)) (2)Example S5 in Table 1 says ?Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay if it is 100%?, whichis assumed by Formula (2).
S5 does not contain an expression such as ?only (??
)?, whichexplicitly specifies that C(x) does not hold when an additional condition is not satisfied.
One mayunderstand that it implicitly means ?Xylitol is not effective at preventing tooth decay if it is not100%,?
but S5 does not structly require this.Consequence side Constraints on the degree of achieving the ConsequenceThere are sentences in partial entailment or contradiction where the degree of achieving of the Con-sequence is limited.
To represent these limitations on the Consequence side, we define a CONFINE-MENT relation where the degrees of the Consequence are limited as in Example (3b).
We define thefollowing formula to represent these limitations on the Consequence side.
?x((P (x) ?
Cr(x)) (3)Cr(x) represents C(x) with additional restriction.
For example, S3 in Table 1 says that Xylitol issomewhat effective at preventing tooth decay, which means that there are cases in which Xylitol cannot prevent tooth decay.
In the case of S3, Cr(x) is ?is a bit effective?.
This type of CONFINE-MENT provides valuable information about Xylitol?s limited ability to promote dental hygiene in S3.217All CONFINEMENTs on the Consequence side are of type EXPLICIT CONFINEMENT, because theyexplicitly mean that a part of the Consequence is achieved but no other parts are achieved.3.2 Semantic TemplatesWe propose a series of semantic templates to classify sentence pairs into one of the CONFINEMENTrelation subtypes we define.
The semantic templates take a set of features as input and use their valuesto categorize the sentence pair.
In Section 4, we evaluate the coverage of the semantic templates byclassifying a small set of sentence pairs using manually set feature values.
In Section 6, we providemore realistic evaluation by using a proposed system to set the feature values automatically and classifysentence pairs as ENTAILMENT / CONTRADICTION, or CONFINEMENT.We assume that each sentence consists of a Premise and Consequence, and that each sentence pairwhich has a CONFINEMENT relation contains at least one additional condition or one additional limitationas defined in Section 3.1.We know that there are a variety of expressions that indicate the presence of a CONFINEMENT relation.For example, both ?Only 100% pure Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay.?
and ?Xylitol is noteffective at preventing tooth decay unless it is 100% pure.?
are CONFINEMENTs of ?Xylitol is effectiveat preventing tooth decay.?
Since it is impossible to handle all possible expressions that indicate CON-FINEMENT, we focus on covering as many as possible with three features: (1) the type of constraint, (2)the type of Premise, and (3) the type of Consequence.
The features are defined in more detail below.IF-Constraint This feature indicates the type of logical constraint in the Text sentence.
Its values canbe ?IF,?
?ONLY-IF.
?Premise This feature indicates the type of Premise in the Text sentence.
The value ?P+A?
or ?notP+A?means there is an Additional Condition on the Premise.
The value ?P?
or ?notP?
means there is justa Premise.
?not?
represents the Premise have a negation.Consequence This feature indicates the type of Consequence.
Its possible values are ?C?
(just a Conse-quence), ?notC?
(negated Consequence), ?Cr?
or ?notCr?
(certain partial Consequence).Semantic templates consist of a tuple of four feature values and a mapping to the confinement type theyindicate.
A full list of templates is given in Table 1.
In the templates, a wildcard asterisk ?*?
indicatesthat any feature value can match in that slot of the template.
The abbreviations ENT, CONT and CONFstand for ENTAILMENT, CONFINEMENT and CONFINEMENT respectively.Semantic templates are applied in turn from top pattern by determining the value of each feature andlooking up the corresponding relation type in Table 1.
We give a classification examples below.
The userquery is sentence S0.
Sentences S1 are Web texts.Query : S0.
Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay.Text [ONLY-IF P(x) ?
AC(x) then C(x) ]: S1.
Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay when youtake it every day without fail.In Example, IF-Constraint is ?ONLY-IF?, Premise is ?P+A?, and the type of Consequence is ?C?.This instance has an additional condition and the Consequence matches the Query, so it is identified asan EXPLICIT CONFINEMENT.4 Verifying Semantic TemplatesIn this section, we verify the effectiveness of semantic templates in recognizing CONFINEMENT rela-tions by testing them on real-world data in Japanese.
To directly evaluate the quality of the templates,we construct a small data set of sentence pairs and manually annotate them with the correct values foreach of the features defined in Section 3.2.4.1 DataWe constructed the Development set and the Open-test set of sample Japanese user queries and Inter-net text pairs following the methodology of Murakami et al (2009).
However, Murakami et al (2009)annotated Query-Text pairs with coarse-grained AGREEMENT and CONFLICT relations that subsume the218Table 1: Semantic templates for recognizing CONFINEMENTSemantic features Relation Number of Number of ExampleIF-constraint Premise Consequence positive negative S0:????????????????

As our task is to discriminate between CON-FINEMENT and RTE relations, we annotate each sentence pair or each statement1 pair with one of thefollowing relations instead: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, or CONFINEMENT.
In the case of CON-FINEMENT, we annotate Query-Text pairs which are not full ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION butthese Text partially agrees and disagrees with the Query.
Annotations were checked by two native speak-ers of Japanese, and any sentence pair where annotation agreement is not reached was discarded.
Table2 shows that how many sentences or statements are in each data set.
Annotated statements counts arewritten in parentheses.
We use the Development set for evaluation of verifying semantic templates anddevelop list of lexical and syntactic patterns for semantic features extraction, and the Open-test set forevaluation in Section 6.4.2 Verification ResultAfter the data was prepared, we annotated it with the correct feature values for use with the semantictemplates.
This was done by manually checking for words or phrases in the sentences that indicated oneof the features in Table 1.
Once the features were set, we used them to classify each sentence pair.We give the numbers of instances that we could confirm for each pattern in the sixth column of Table1 and the numbers of negative instances in the seventh column, which satisfy semantic template but doesnot agree Relation values in the fifth column.
As a result we find that there were no statement pairs thatcould not be successfully classified.
We grasp CONFINEMENT relation with semantic templates for themost part.
This verification data does not cover all combinations of patterns in our semantic templates, sowe can not rule out the possibility of existence of an exception that cannot be classified by the semantictemplates.
However, we find these results to be an encouraging indication of the usefulness of semantictemplates.
Here are some example classifications found in the verification data.Coordinate clauses Combining multiple of IMPLICIT CONFINEMENTs results in an EXPLICIT CON-FINEMENT relation(4)S0.
???????????
?.Steroid has side-effects.S1.
??????????????????????????????????????
?1Murakami et al define a ?statement?
as the smallest unit that can convey a complete thought or viewpoint.
In practice, thiscan be a sentence or something smaller such as a clause.219??????????????????
?.Long-term use of steroid causes side-effects, but there is no need to worry about side-effectsin short-term usage.In Example (4), S1 is an EXPLICIT CONFINEMENT for S0.
This is derived from the combination ofCONFINEMENT of the two coordinate clauses of S1: the former phrase ?Long-term use of steroid causesside-effects?
of S1 is an IMPLICIT CONFINEMENT for S0 by our semantic templates and the latter phraseis an IMPLICIT CONFINEMENT for S0.Additional information for whole Query Combining of a CONTRADICTION and an IMPLICIT CON-FINEMENT result in an EXPLICIT CONFINEMENT(5)S0.
???????????????
?.Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay.S1.
??????????????????????,??????????????????????????????????????
?.Tooth decay can not be prevented with Xylitol alone, but it can be fundamentally preventedwith an appropriate diet and by taking Xylitol after every meal.The first clause before the comma in S1 of Example (5) corresponds to the entire sentence of S0.
Thesecond clause after the comma helps us recognize that it is a CONFINEMENT relation.
This instanceis also a combination of semantic templates, so we need to recognize negation of each statement andadversative conjunction but we do not need to add new features to Table 1.5 Proposed SystemWe propose a system which uses semantic templates for recognizing CONFINEMENT consists of sixsteps: (I) linguistic analysis, (II) structural alignment, (III) Premise and Consequence identification,(IV) semantic feature extraction, (V) adversative conjunction identification, and (VI) semantic templateapplication.
Figure 1 shows the work flow of the system.
This system takes as input corresponding to S0and S1, and return a semantic relation.5.1 I. Linguistic AnalysisIn linguistic analysis, we conduct word segmentation, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and extendedmodality analysis.
This linguistic analysis acts as the basis for alignment and semantic feature extrac-tion.
For syntactic analysis, we identify words and POS tags with the Japanese morphological analyserMecab2, and we use the Japanese dependency parser CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto (2002)) to pro-duce dependency trees.
We also conduct extended modality analysis using the resources provided byMatsuyoshi et al (2010).5.2 II.
Structural AlignmentTo identify the consequence of S0 in S1, we use Structural Alignment (Mizuno et al (2010)).
In Struc-tural Alignment, dependency parent-child links are aligned across sentences using a variety of resourcesto ensure semantic relatedness.5.3 III.
Premise and Consequence identificationIn this step, we identify the Premise and the Consequence in S1.
When a sentence pair satisfies allitems is satisfying, we can identify a focused chunk as the Consequence in S1:1.
A chunk?s modality in S0 is assertion, this chunk is the Consequence in S02.
A chunk in S1 align with the Consequence in S0We identify the Premise in S1 when a sentence pair satisfies first, and either second or third item ofthe following conditions:1.
A case particle of chunks in S0 is either ??
(agent marker)?
or ??
(topic marker)?
and these chunksare children of the Consequence in S0?s dependency tree2.
The subject in S0 aligns with the subject of S13.
All of the dependants of the expression ???
(to, for)?
have alignments in S0 dependency tree2http://chasen.org/taku/ software/mecab/.220Figure 1: An overview of a proposal system to recognize CONFINEMENT5.4 IV.
Semantic Feature ExtractionWe extract features for the semantic templates using a list of lexical and syntactic patterns.
Thesepatterns were manually compiled using the development data set introduced in Section 4.
Features forthe semantic templates are then automatically extracted by applying these patterns to input sentencepairs.
The following overviews our extraction approach for each feature.5.4.1 IF-Constraint Feature ExtractionUsing CaboCha, we manually constructed lists of words and their POS that are indicators of thesemantic condition under which a Premise occurs.
We extract as features any words in the input sentencesthat appear in the list with the corresponding POS.
The ?IF?
lexical type lists conjunctions that are theresults of a conditional chunk or noun phrases that indicate a case or situation.
The ?ONLY-IF?
lexicaltype is used to represent the most constraining situations.
The following is our list of expressions.?
IF: ??
(in case),?/??/?
(when),?/??/??
(if),?
(with)?
ONLY-IF: ??/???
(for this time), ??/??/??
(only), ???
(for the first time), ??
(to,for)5.4.2 Premise Feature ExtractionWe treat the words or phrases which are extracted from the constraint as conditions, and need to decidewhether a given condition is the Premise or an additional condition for the Premise.
The Premise is setto ?P?
when first step and either the second or third step of the following conditions are satisfied, and itis set to ?P+A?
otherwise:1. ?
The condition have children in the S1?s dependency tree or the condition?s children are not alignedto chunks in S02.
?
The condition?s parent in S0?s dependency tree has any chunk with a child aligned with the Conse-quence in S0, or the condition?s parent is not aligned with chunks in S03.
?
The condition?s parent does not have any expression with the meaning of ?use?
in the S0?s depen-dency treeWhen these step are satisfied and negation exists in conditional chunks, Premise is set to ?notP+A,?
ifthese step are not satisfied, Premise is set to ?notP.?
In the third step, we identify expressions with themeaning of ?use?
with our lexical list.
For example ??
(use), ???
(eat), ??
(take) and so on.
Ifthe condition?s parent has words in our lexical list, we identify that ?Xylitol?
and ?eating Xylitol?
and?using Xylitol?
are equivalent.5.4.3 Consequence Feature ExtractionThis feature is used to indicate the semantic relationship between Consequences of the sentences pair.Sentences with Consequences that share a certain amount of similarity in polarity and syntax are judgedto have ENTAILMENT, otherwise they are in CONTRADICTION.
In order to be judged as ENTAILMENT,the following conditions must all be true:1.
The modality of the Consequences must be identical.2.
The polarity of the Consequences must be identical as indicated by the resources in (Sumida et al(2008))3.
The Premises of both sentences must align with each other2214.
?
The sentences must not contain expressions that limit range or degree such as ?????
(almost)?or ???
(degree)?When all item are satisfied, the Consequence is set to ?C?, otherwise it is set to ?notC.?
We identifywhether the consequence has expressions which limit the degree or not.
The Consequence is set to ?Cr?or ?notCr?
when the following all conditions is satisfied:1.
Any of the children of the Consequence align with a chunk in S0?s dependency tree.2.
?
There are expressions limiting the degree of the Consequence or the siblings in S1?s dependencytreeWhen this two steps are satisfied and the all four steps to judge whether sentence pairs is ENTAILMENTor not are not satisfied, Consequence is set to ?notCr.
?5.5 V. Adversative Conjunction IdentificationWe manually compiled a list of target expressions including conjunctions such as ??
(but).?
When aS1 chunk containing an adversative conjunction that aligns with the Premise of S0 or the S0?s Premisedepends on S1 chunk containing an adversative conjunction, we set each feature set in a chunk before anadversative conjunction and after an adversative conjunction to semantic templates.5.6 VI.
Semantic Template ApplicationWe apply semantic feature extracted in Step IV to semantic templates.
If S1 matches multiple semantictemplates with an adversative conjunction from Step V, we combine the semantic templates.
We get arelation for a sentence pair in this step.5.7 Example of Semantic Features ExtractionFeature extraction is illustrated in greater detail in the examples S0 which is the query and S1 inTable 1.
First, we identify words represented IF-Constraint is ?ONLY-IF?
: ??
(when)?
is in S1 and theconditional chunk has a word ???
(only).?
Next, we evaluate each the type of Premise of each chunk todetermine if it is a premise or an additional condition.
The subject word ?Xylitol?
align between S0 andS1, and the conditional chunk?s sibling in dependency tree of S1 is a chunk which has the subject.
Andthe conditional chunk have a child which is not aligned any chunk in S0, it is ?100%?
(100%).?
And theconditional chunk has no negations.
So, Premise is set to ?P+A.?
Finally, we check if the consequencesto the conditions are aligned to the verbs and nouns indicating consequences in S0: ?prevent?
and ?iseffective?
are aligned, the modality and polarity of the Consequence are identical, these depended on bythe condition, and the Consequence has no expressions which limited range or degree.
Consequence isset to ?C.
?We set the semantic template features and get a result which the sentences relation is EXPLICITCONFINEMENT.
Ideally patterns for setting semantic feature for semantic templates should be learnedautomatically, but this remains an area of future work.
Nonetheless, our current experiment gives a goodmeasure of the effectiveness of semantic templates in recognizing CONFINEMENT relations.6 EvaluationIn Section 4, we verified that the semantic templates defined in Section 3.2 can successfully classifysemantic relations as CONFINEMENT given the correct feature values.
In this Section, we present theresults of an experiment in a more realistic setting by using semantic templates together with the featuresautomatically extracted as described with our proposed system in Section 5 to determine whether or nota sentence pair has a CONFINEMENT relation.6.1 Setting up EvaluationWhile more research on recognizing ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION between sentences pairs isnecessary, it is important to recognize new relations that cannot be analysed in existing frameworks inorder to provide Internet users with the information they need.
Thus, We assume that unrelated sentencepairs will be discarded before classification, in this experiment we focus only on the recognition ofCONFINEMENT relations.
So our goal in this experiment is to classify between CONFINEMENT and NOTCONFINEMENT.
We will evaluate determining whether CONFINEMENT sentence pairs are Explicit orImplicit in future.
In our experiment, we used a gold data for structural alignment to evaluate semanticfeature extraction.222Table 3: Results of recognizing confinement relations with our proposal systemRecall Precision F-Scoreproposed system 0.65(129/200) 0.57(129/225) 0.61baseline system 0.96(192/200) 0.34(192/562) 0.50Table 4: Instances of incorrect classificationS0 S1A ???????????????.

Step relying on these resources are marked with a?
in Section 5 and are skipped in the baseline.
Essentially, we conduct Steps I, II, and III, the parts ofStep IV that can be done without manually-compiled patterns, and, finally, Step VI.In Step IV, we determine if there are any limitations on the Consequence in the Consequence Featuresubset, but we do not judge whether the Consequence is ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION in thebaseline system.6.3 Result and Error AnalysisThe results are given in Table 3.
We find that our system has much higher precision than the baseline,improving by over 20%.
In our system, the list of semantic patterns is effective at recognizing CON-FINEMENT.
On the other hand recall has gone down compared to the baseline.
The baseline judged thatalmost sentences are CONFINEMENT, so the list of semantic patterns employed in our rule-based systemis useful at eliminating false positives.
Table 4 shows some instances of incorrect classification.
Eachinstance is a pair (S0, S1).Example A-S1 means ?Excess intake of isoflavon can not boost one?s health?
and ?excess intake?
isan additional condition for A-S1.
In this case ?excess?
is a lexical specifier of the specific condition andis indicated by the particle ???.
The particle ??
(topic marker)?
is not currently used as a feature in thesemantic templates since it is very noisy, so this instance can not be detected.
We need to expand ourmethod of acquiring semantic patterns to better handle such cases.The additional condition phrase in Example B-S1 modifies ?The use of Xylitol?
instead of ?is effectiveat preventing tooth decay?, preventing us from properly recognizing the limiting condition in this case.We need to conduct deeper scopal analysis to determine when the modifier of an embedded chunk shouldbe considered as an additional condition.Example C-S1 is an instance where the system fails to recognize that ?put in their mouth?
is an expres-sion meaning ?use?
since our lists of lexical words for features did not have it.
We should increase ourability to recognize synonyms of ?to use?
by automatically mining data for paraphrases or approachingit as a machine learning task in order to handle examples like C-S1.
On the other hands ?if steroid useis stopped?
in example D-S1 is the premise which should indicate an IF condition and Negation exists,however we can not recognize it correctly since the phrase lacks negation.
We will make a list of wordsand phrases that are antonyms of ?use?
in order to recognize such instances.The condition in example E-S1 is about how side-effects appear, and not a condition for the othersentence example E-S0.
This instance requires detailed semantic analysis and cannot be solved withalignment-based approaches.
It represents a very difficult class of problems.2237 ConclusionOn theWeb, much of the information and opinions we encounter indicates the conditions or limitationsunder which a statement is true.
This information is important to Internet users who are interested indetermining the validity of a query of interest, but such information cannot be represented under theprevalent RTE framework containing only ENTAILMENT and CONTRADICTION.In this paper, we provided a logical definition of the CONFINEMENT relation and showed how itcould be used to represent important information that is omitted under an RTE framework.
We alsoproposed a set of semantic templates that use set of features extracted from sentences pairs to recognizeCONFINEMENT relations between two sentences.
Preliminary investigations showed that given correctfeature input, semantic templates could effectively recognize CONFINEMENT relations.In addition, we presented empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of semantic templates andautomatically-extracted features at recognizing CONFINEMENT between user queries and Web text pairs,and conducted error analysis of the results.
Currently, our system does not deal with unknown instanceswell since it extracts features for semantic template using manually constructed lexical patterns.
In fu-ture work, we will learn features for the semantic templates directly from data to better handle unknowninstances.AcknowledgmentThis work is supported by the National Institute of Information and Communications TechnologyJapan.ReferencesAbe, T. (1996).
