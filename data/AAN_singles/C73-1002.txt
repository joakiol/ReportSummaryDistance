WERNER BRECHTMORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (A FORMAL APPROACH)1.
MOTIVATION AND BASIC IDEASSince 1972 a researcher team in Bonn has been working on theautomatic syntax-analysis of the german language.
The morphoJogicalanalysis is a part of this work that has already been formalized and pro-grammed by the author.
We can consider the following paper as ageneralization f this formalized escription.In this first chapter some expressions like " text"  or "lexicon " areconsidered clear by intuition.
Later on we'll get to know the exactdefinitions.
The basis o f  each description of a text of any language isa morphological nalysis of this text.
One can easily agree that such adescription has to be derived from the words or sentences of the textwhich is to be described.
The expression "description of a text" isunderstood in a very general sense.. One can imagine asyntactic descrip-tion or a semantic interpretation r a combination of both of them orany other information.In a natural anguage the number of the possible texts is not finite.That's easy to prove because of the following sentences:One is a numberTwo is a numberHence it's impossible in practice to use a lexicon of the followingformtext 1 description of text 1text 2 description of text 2o , w  ?

There remains only one possibility.
Onehas to ascribe the words and sequences of  words which every textconsists of  with one or more (homography) descriptions.
Then onecan try to derive the descriptions of the text out of the descriptions ofthe words or sequences of  words.2.
BASIC DEFINITIONS2.1.
Remark.Let A and B be sets.
Then denotes:P(A) : the set of all subsets of  A (the powerset of A)A* : the free monoid over AA ?
B: the cartesian product of A and BI xl : the " length"  of  x ~ A* (the number of  elements of Awhich x consists o f ) ; I  xl ~ IN.Now we'll define the expressions "character " and "s t r ing"  fora language.
We use five basic sets:LETT  :=  {A, B, G, ..., Z} the set of  "letters "DIG :=  {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} the set of " digits "BLANK:  = {L_a} =:  {blank},/t._a/= 1, I_..a E BLANK*PS : = {.}
U {,} U { !}
U ... the set of  "punctuation-signs "SS :=  {%, &, ~, ...} the set of  " special-signs"From these five sets we derive:a) CHAR:  = LETTU DIG U BLANKU PS U SS the set of"characters"If x ~ CHAR,  we say: "x  is a character ".b) CHAR*:  the free monoid over CHAR.If x ~ CHAR*,  we say: "x  is a string "or: x is a sequence of  characters"or: x is a text "c) LISS: = LETTO DIG U SS the set of  "Characters withoutblank and punctuation-signs"d) LISS*: the free monoid over LISS.If x ~ LISS*, we say: "x  is a string without blank and punc-tuation-signs ".MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 112.2.

THE INPUT FOR THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSISOur analysis will accept every x ~ CHAR*.3.1.
Remark.x ~ CHAR*,  I xl = 0 (x = e) is a trivial case because there is no-thing to analyse.Let x be a text, x ~ CHAR*.

REMARKS TO THE CONCEPT '~ LEXICON "?
In using the expression "lexicon "all actions identifying and describ-ing words, sentences and texts can be concentrated in a single concept.In a formal sense any lexicon is a set o f  " i tems ".Definition.LEX: = ({w, B)x}, X e A (.4: any index-set)The pair (w, B)x is called an " i tem " o f  the lexicon.For every item holds:a) w={u,1} {w,} ... {w=}, m> 1, w i~ WORD2U PS ( i=1 ,2, ..., m)b) w~ (i = 1, 2, ..., m) is fixed as a word or punctuation-sign ofa language.c) B is any description o f  w.Let 113 be the set o f  all intended descriptions o f  all sequences o fwords and punctuation-signs of  some language.
ThenLEX ?
(P(WORD))* X 113such that(., B) L X: b) c)LEX is a relation between (P(WORD))* and XB.
In general a se-quence {wl} {w,} ... {w=} has more than one description (by homographyfor example).
Hence LEX can't be a map between (P(WORD))* and113.There are two ways to define a lexicon.a) The extensional definition.
All the elements o f  the lexicon arelisted off.
In this case we often call such a lexicon a "l ist "Examples.1) A: = (1, 2, 3}x is element of  A: ** x = 1 ,, x = 2 v x ----- 32) w is a noun: ** w is element of  a list of  nouns.b) The intensional definition.
All the elements of  the lexicon are fixedby some common properties.. .

THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSISThe concept of the "morphological analysing step " is related toone and only one subsequence t e T.The concept of the " morphological analysis " however is moregeneral.Let x ~ segm(CHAR*) ,  x .

EXAMPLE FOR A PRACTICAL MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSISThis example shows the practice of a morphological analysis of agerman text and has indeed been programmed in Bonn to be the basisof the above mentioned syntax-analysis.Let x ~ segm(CHAR*) ,  x * ep, x = (Ul) (u2} .

\u.,, B,a, B.2 ............ B.L,,In our syntax-analysis in Bonn a great deal of the morphologicalanalysis is done by word-by-word-analysis.
We are successful in describ-ing articles, nouns~ adverbs, adjectives and so on, but we have sometrouble with our verbs.In the german language the prefix of some verbs may be foundfar away from the stem of the verb.20 V?~RNE_R Bl~CHTExample.The verbs zulaufen and laufen are two quite different verbs.
Wewill regard the following three german sentences:1) Ein I-Iund ist mir zugelaufen.2) Lauf mir nur nicht zu.3) Zu ist er mir gelaufen.A word-by-word-analysis will succeed only with sentence 1).
In2) and 3) we'll find the verb laufen instead of zulaufen.
That meansthat we get a wrong description of our verb and a wrong descriptionof zu which .exists in the german language also without any relationto a verb.
Therefore to analyse our verbs a word-by-word-analysis iimpossible.In our analysis we differ between two parts of the lexicon.The first one allows word-by-word-analysis and is intensionallydefined for proper-names, nouns and adjectives and is extensionallydefined for all other words without verbs.
The extensionally definedpart of this lexicon consists at this time of nearly 2000 items.The second one is our verb-lexicon which is intensionally defined.There exists an extensionally defined verb-stem-lexicon which con-tains at this moment he stems with their prefixes of nearly 400 ger-man verbs.
This stem-lexicon is quickly increasing and is coded inthe following manner:\[(stem} \[description f "stem "\]\]\[(prefix} (stem} \[description f "prefix stem"\]\]\[{lauf} \[description f "lauf"\]\]\[(zu} (lauf} \[description f "zulauf"\]\]We start the morphological nalysis with a word-by-word-analysis.If our analysis was successful we have got to each word of some textat least one description.
Some of these descriptions may be wrongThat's because of the homography and because of the verbs.
We can'tsolve the homography-problem in this early part of the analysis.If we have identified a word to be a verb we are looking if in thesame sentence there exists a word which can be prefix of this verb.If we find a possible prefix the verb gets the descriptions resultingof the prefix as well as the descriptions without this prefix.
Workingin this way we get a lot of information for the words of our text.
Someinformation is wrong but we can be sure that the right informationMORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 21is among the descriptions.
It is left to the syntax (or maybe to the se-mantic) to isolate the right descriptions.Formally we can describe the verb-analysis as a set of masj suchthat t: = {u'} {u"} where {u"} has been recognized as a verb and {u'}can be every word (without {u"}) of the same sentence in which {u"}exists.Given some text {u}l {u2} ... {un}.Given a word-by-word-analysis which shows that {ui} may be averb.T ' : :{ t  I t~-{u'} {ui}^u' e{ul, ..., ui.,, ui.,, .

,%} }Then holds:mas, ?
{ (u'} {ul} } x LEXsuch that({u'} {u,}, (w, /3)) e mas, ?, w = {u'} {u,}One might call this procedure a "two-word-analysis ".
We canimagine a " three-word-analysis " and so on too, but up to now inour practice in Bonn the morphological analysis consists only of a" word-by-word-analysis " and a " two-word-analysis " in the aboveshown manner.
