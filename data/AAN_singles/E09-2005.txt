and Second LifeDimitrios Galanis?, George Karakatsiotis?, Gerasimos Lampouras?, Ion Androutsopoulos?+?Department of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece+Digital Curation Unit, Research Centre ?Athena?, Athens, GreeceAbstractWe demonstrate an open-source naturallanguage generation engine that producesdescriptions of entities and classes in En-glish and Greek from OWL ontologies thathave been annotated with linguistic anduser modeling information expressed inRDF.
We also demonstrate an accompany-ing plug-in for the Prote?ge?
ontology editor,which can be used to create the ontology?sannotations and generate previews of theresulting texts by invoking the generationengine.
The engine has been embedded inrobots acting as museum tour guides in thephysical world and in Second Life; herewe demonstrate the latter application.1 IntroductionNaturalOWL (Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007;Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2008) is a natu-ral language generation engine that produces de-scriptions of entitities (e.g., items for sale, mu-seum exhibits) and classes (e.g., types of exhibits)in English and Greek from OWL DL ontologies;the ontologies must have been annotated with lin-guistic and user modeling annotations expressedin RDF.1 An accompanying plug-in for the wellknown Prote?ge?
ontology editor is available, whichcan be used to create the linguistic and user model-ing annotations while editing an ontology, as wellas to generate previews of the resulting texts byinvoking the generation engine.2NaturalOWL is based on ideas from ILEX(O?Donnell et al, 2001) and M-PIRO (Isard et al,2003; Androutsopoulos et al, 2007), but it uses1See http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/for information on OWL and its versions.
For informationon RDF, consult http://www.w3.org/RDF/.2M-PIRO?s authoring tool (Androutsopoulos et al, 2007),now called ELEON (Bilidas et al, 2007), can also be used; seehttp://www.iit.demokritos.gr/skel/.Figure 1: Generating texts in Second Life.templates instead of systemic grammars, it is pub-licly available as open-source software, it is writ-ten entirely in Java, and it provides native supportfor OWL ontologies, making it particularly usefulfor Semantic Web applications (Antoniou and vanHarmelen, 2004).3 Well known advantages of nat-ural language generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000)include the ability to generate texts in multiple lan-guages from the same ontology; and the ability totailor the semantic content and language expres-sions of the texts to the user type (e.g., child vs.adult) and the interaction history (e.g., by avoidingrepetitions, or by comparing to previous objects).In project XENIOS (Vogiatzis et al, 2008), Nat-uralOWL was embedded in a mobile robot actingas a museum guide, and in project INDIGO it isbeing integrated in a more advanced robotic guidethat includes a multimodal dialogue manager, fa-cial animation, and mechanisms to recognize andexpress emotions (Konstantopoulos et al, 2009).Here, we demonstrate a similar application, whereNaturalOWL is embedded in a robotic avatar acting3NaturalOWL comes with a GNU General Public Li-cense (GPL).
The software can be downloaded fromhttp://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/.17as a museum guide in Second Life (Oberlander etal., 2008), as shown in figure 1.
We also demon-strate how the underlying ontology of the museumand its linguistic and user modeling annotationscan be edited in Prote?ge?.2 NaturalOWL?s architectureNaturalOWL adopts a typical natural languagegeneration pipeline (Reiter and Dale, 2000).
Itproduces texts in three stages: document planning,microplanning, and surface realization.In document planning, the system first selectsfrom the ontology the logical facts (OWL triples)that will be conveyed to the user, taking into ac-count interest scores manually assigned to thefacts via the annotations of the ontology, as wellas a dynamcally updated user model that showswhat information has already been conveyed to theuser.
Logical facts that report similarities or differ-ences to previously encountered entities may alsobe included in the output of content selection, giv-ing rise to comparisons like the one in figure 1.The selected facts are then ordered using a man-ually specified partial order, which is also part ofthe ontology?s annotations.In micro-planning, the system turns each se-lected fact into a sentence by using micro-plans, ineffect patterns that leave referring expressions un-derspecified.
Figure 2 shows a micro-plan beingedited with NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge?
plug-in.
Themicro-plan specifies that to express a fact that in-volves the made-of property, the system shouldconcatenate an automatically generated referringexpression (e.g., name, pronoun, definite nounphrase) in nominative case for the owner of thefact (semantic subject of the triple), the verb form?is made?
(or ?are made?, if the subject is in plu-ral), the preposition ?of?, and then another au-tomatically generated referring expression in ac-cusative case for the filler of the property (seman-tic object).
The referring expressions are gener-ated by taking into account the context of eachsentence, attempting to avoid repetitions withoutintroducing ambiguities.
Domain-independent ag-gregation rules are then employed to combine theresulting sentences into longer ones.In surface realization, the final form of the textis produced; it can be marked up automaticallywith tags that indicate punctuation symbols, gram-matical categories, the logical facts expressed bythe sentences, the interest (Int) of each sen-tence?s information, the degree (Assim) to whichthe information is taken to be assimilated by theuser etc., as shown below.
In INDIGO, compar-isons are also marked up with angles that guidethe robot to turn to the object(s) it compares to.<Period><Sentence Property=".../#type"Int="3" Assim="0"><Demonstrative ref=".../#exhibit1"role="owner">This</Demonstrative><Verb>is</Verb><NP ref=".../#Amphora" role="filler">an amphora</NP></Sentence><Punct>,</Punct><Sentence Property=".../#subtypeInt="3" Assim="1"><EmptyRef ref=".../#Amphora"role="owner"/><NP ref=".../#Vessel" role="filler">a type of vessel</NP></Sentence><Punct>;</Punct><Sentence Property=".../#paintedBy"Int="2" Assim="0"><Pronoun ref=".../#exhibit1"role="owner">it</Pronoun><Verb>was painted</Verb><Preposition>by</Preposition><Name ref=".../#pKleo" role="filler">the painter of Kleophrades</Name></Sentence><Punct>.</Punct></Period>2.1 Using NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge?
plug-inNaturalOWL?s plug-in for Prote?ge?
can be used tospecify all the linguistic and user modeling an-notations of the ontologies that NaturalOWL re-quires.
The annotations in effect establish adomain-dependent lexicon, whose entries are as-sociated with classes or entities of the ontology;micro-plans, which are associated with proper-ties of the ontology; a partial order of proper-ties, which is used in document planning; interestscores, indicating how interesting the various factsof the ontology are to each user type; parametersthat control, for example, the desired length of thegenerated texts.
The plug-in can also be used togenerate previews of the resulting texts, for differ-ent types of users, with or without comparisons,etc., as illustrated in figure 3.
The resulting anno-tations are then saved in RDF.2.2 Using NaturalOWL in Second LifeIn Second Life, each user controls an avatar, whichcan, among other actions, move in the virtualworld, touch objects, or communicate with other18Figure 2: Specifying a micro-plan with NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge?
plug-in.Figure 3: Generating a text preview with NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge?
plug-in.19avatars; in the latter case, the user types text on thekeyboard.
In the Second Life application that wedemonstrate, the robot is an avatar that is not con-trolled by a human, but by our own Second Lifeclient software.4 The client software includes anavigation component, which controls the robot?smovement, and it allows the robot to ?utter?
textsgenerated by NaturalOWL, instead of expectingkeyboard input.
Whenever a visitor near the robottouches an exhibit, an appropriate event is sent tothe robot, which then goes near the exhibit andstarts describing it.53 Conclusions and further workThe demonstration presents an open-source nat-ural language generation engine for OWL ontolo-gies, which generates descriptions of entities andclasses in English and Greek.
The engine is ac-companied by a Prote?ge?
plug-in, which can beused to annotate the ontologies with linguistic anduser modeling information required by the gener-ation engine.
The demonstration includes an ap-plication in Second Life, where the generation en-gine is embedded in a robotic avatar acting as amuseum guide.
We are currently extending Natu-ralOWL to handle follow up questions about enti-ties or classes mentioned in the generated texts.AcknowledgmentsNaturalOWL was developed in project XENIOS,which was funded by the Greek General Secre-tariat of Research and Technology and the Euro-pean Union.6 NaturalOWL is now being extendedin project INDIGO, which is funded by the Euro-pean Union; our work in INDIGO is also supportedby additional funding from the Greek General Sec-retariat of Research and Technology.7ReferencesI.
