WORDNET: A LEXICAL DATABASE FOR ENGLISHGeorge A. Miller, Principal InvestigatorCognitive Science LaboratoryPr inceton Univers i tyPrinceton, New Jersey 08544PROJECT GOALSWordNet is a lexical database for English organized in ac-cordance with current psycholinguistic heories.
Lexicalizedconcepts are organized by semantic relations (synonymy,antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, etc.)
for nouns, verbs, andadjectives.Work under this grant is intended to extend and upgradeWordNet, to make it generally available, and to develop it asa tool for use in practical applications.
In order to make itavailable for information retrieval and machine translation, asystem is being developed that accepts English text as inputand automatically gives as output he same text augmentedby syntactic and semantic notations that disambiguate all ofthe substantive words.
Initially, the semantic tagging is beingdone manually so that we can (1) obtain extensive experiencewith the tagging process and (2) create adatabase of correctlytagged text for use in testing proposals for automatic sensedisambiguation.RECENT RESULTSThe work falls into four categories: (1) Preprocessing oftextual corpora; (2) Development of ConText, an interfacefor semantically tagging text; (3) WordNet upgrade and; (4)Software development and distribution of WordNet.Textual Corpora.
Acquisition of several large text corporaand development ofprograms to preprocess them.
Currentlythe preprocessor formats the text one sentence per line,searches the text for all WordNet collocations, tokenizes thetext accordingly, and subsequently runs the text through apart-of-speech tagger.
The search for WordNet collocationshandles inflectional morphology.ConText Interface.
ConText is an X-windows interface toWordNet which takes the preprocessed text (described above)as input and accesses the WordNet entry for each contentword (in the appropriate part of speech).
The user selectsthe appropriate sense or, if that is not possible, indicatesthe nature of the problem encountered.
ConText outputsthe text with pointers to the selected WordNet senses (or, ifno sense is chosen, the reason why).
Current and previoussentences are displayed to give the user adequate context fordisarnbiguation.
The inflectional morphology component ofWordNet is used by ConText so that the WordNet uninflectedforms are found even though inflected forms are both inputto and output from ConText.WordNet Upgrade.
As of January, 1992 the number ofdifferent character strings in WordNet is 62,726; the numberof lexicalized concepts (synsets) is 50,318; the number ofunique string-sense combinations is 98,300; the total numberof semantic pointers is 71,126; and the number of synsetscontaining definitional explanations i  20,718.
In addition,the grammatical category of relational adjectives has beenadded to WordNet.
These adjectives are defined by unidirec-tional pointers to the related noun, encoding the distinctionbetween the adjective "nervous" in "nervous tudent" and therelational adjective in "nervous condition.
"Software Development.
WordNet has been developed onSun SPARCstations in the C language with an X-windowsinterface.
MS-DOS and NeXT interfaces are also available.A Macintosh interface is currently being developed.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARThe organization of WordNet provides an estimation of se-mantic distances between lexicalized concepts, and researchwill focus on how this feature can be exploited to facilitatelexical disambiguation.
Once a large enough body of semanti-cally tagged text has been created using ConText, hypothesescan be tested.
To facilitate retrieval of semantically relatedwords from WordNet, it is likely that WordNet will be putinto a relational database.WordNet will continue to be extended and upgraded.
Thedirection of this work will be determined, in part, by theresults of the semantic tagging.483
