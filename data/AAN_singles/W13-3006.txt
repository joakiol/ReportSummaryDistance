vowel har-mony patterns are studied in the context ofsubclasses of regular functions.
The anal-ysis suggests that the computational com-plexity of phonology can be reduced fromregular to weakly deterministic.1 IntroductionThe expressivity of ordered rewrite-rule grammarsfor phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968, hence-forth SPE) and two-level phonology (Kosken-niemi, 1983) are exactly the class of regular re-lations (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan and Kay, 1994;Beesley and Kartunnen, 2003).
Since SPE-stylegrammars can express virtually any phonologi-cal generalization, it follows that the generaliza-tions themselves are regular, even if they are rep-resented with other formalisms (such as OT gram-mars).This result can be interpreted cognitively asestablishing a universal property of phonologicalpatterns: humanly possible phonological patternsare regular.
If correct, this would mean, for ex-ample, that humanly possible syntactic patternswhich are nonregular are not humanly possiblephonological patterns (Heinz and Idsardi, 2011;Lai, 2012; Heinz and Idsardi, 2013).Recent research suggests that stronger univer-sals than ?being regular?
can be established forphonology.
It has been shown that segmentalphonotactic patterns are star-free (Heinz et al2011), as are virtually all stress patterns (Rogerset al to appear), and the semantics of two-levelrules appear to ensure that these mappings havestar-free-like properties, provided the contexts tothe rules are star-free (Yli-Jyra?
and Koskenniemi,2006).11There are multiple ways to generalize the class of star-free regular sets to regular relations (Benedikt et al 2001) soThis paper examines the hypothesis that subse-quentiality is a necessary property of phonologi-cal patterns by studying theories of iterative vowelharmony.
Informally, a function is left (right) sub-sequential if there is a finite-state transducer de-scribing the function which processes strings fromleft to right (right to left) deterministically on theinput.
We use the term ?subsequentiality?
to meaneither left or right subsequential.Previous work has found that synchronically at-tested metathesis patterns and partial reduplica-tion patterns are either left or right subsequen-tial (Chandlee et al 2012; Chandlee and Heinz,2012).
Also Gainor et al(2012) show that thevowel harmony generalizations in Nevins (2010)are also left or right subsequential mappings.Gainor et als analysis, while insightful, is in-complete since Nevin?s theory of vowel harmonyinvokes underspecification and other theories ofvowel harmony do not.
Phonological underspec-ification is explained in section 3.
The linguis-tic generalizations examined in this paper comefrom two types of theories of vowel harmonypatterns in linguistics which do not use under-specification: traditional directional theories anddominant/recessive/stem-control theories.We prove that subsequentiality separates di-rectional theories from logically possible but?pathological?
vowel harmony patterns (Wil-son 2003).
(This claim was also made byGainor et alwithout proof.)
It is alsoshown that dominant/recessive/stem-control theo-ries posit generalizations which are neither left norright subsequential, but which are weakly deter-ministic.
Informally, this means that these gen-eralizations can be decomposed into a left sub-sequential and right subsequential function with-out the left-subsequential function marking up itsoutput in any special way.
We conjecture this isit would be interesting to determine more exactly the natureof such two-level rules.52not the case for the pathological patterns.
Sincesubsequential and weakly deterministic functionsare proper subclasses of regular relations, theseresults suggest concretely how the computationalcomplexity of phonology established by earlier re-searchers can be improved.Mathematical and phonological preliminariesare given in sections 2 and 3, respectively.

|w|](1)Regular relations are those describable byfinite-state transducers (FSTs).2 A finite-statetransducer T is a tuple (Q,X, Y, I, F, ?)
where2In the algebraic theory of automata, these are called ra-tional relations (Berstel, 1979; Sakarovitch, 2009).Q is a finite set of states, X and Y are finite al-phabets, I, F ?

(2)Let RR denote the class of regular relations.
Thisclass is closed under concatenation, Kleene clo-sure, union, composition, and inversion, but notintersection or complement.A subsequential transducer is a tuple(Q, q0,X, Y, ?, ?
), where Q is a finite set ofstates, X and Y are finite alphabets, q0 ?
Q isthe initial state, and ?

(3)Since subsequential transducers are deterministic,the relations they recognize are functions.Functions recognized by subsequential trans-ducers are called left subsequential.
A functionf is right subsequential iff its reverse f r is leftsubsequential.
Observe that for all w ?
X?, theimage of a right subsequential function f of w canbe calculated by reversing w, processing the resultwith the subsequential transducer T recognizingf r, and then reversing the result.
Formally,(?w ?
X?
)[f(w) = T (wr)r].
(4)However, there is another way to state the abovewithout the reversing function (?r).
This is to rec-ognize that f(w) can be computed by applying T53to w from right to left, instead of from left to right.When T processes w right to left, we write?
?T (w)and when T processes w left to right, we write?
?T (w).
Then we can restate Equation 4 as(?w ?
X?
)[f(w) =?
?T (w)].
(5)Let LSF and RSF denote the class of left andright subsequential functions, respectively.Theorem 1 (Mohri 1997) The following hold:1.
LSF,RSF ( RR.2.
RSF r = LSF .3.
LSF and RSF are incomparable.There are some relevant subclasses and gen-eralizations of subsequentiality.
A subsequentialtransduction T is sequential iff for all q ?
Q, itis the case that ?
(q) = ?.3 Mohri (1997) gen-eralizes subsequentiality to p-subsequentiality (al-lowing up to p outputs for each input), preservingmany important properties.
Mohri?s generaliza-tions are important here because there are likelyto be a bounded number of exceptions, or optionalforms, in actual vowel harmony systems that falloutside the purview of the 1-subsequential anal-ysis presented here, but which would presumablynot fall outside a p-subsequential analysis (not pre-sented here).Elgot and Mezei proved the following.Theorem 2 (Elgot and Mezei 1965) LetT : X?

L.What this decomposition means is that the com-putation of T (x) = y can be accomplished by(1) reading x sequentially from left to right with asubsequential transducer, which transforms it intoa word z possibly marking it up with additionalsymbols; (2) reading the resulting word z fromright to left with another subsequential transducerand writing from right to left the final output y. Astheir proof makes clear, this decomposition of Tis possible because the alphabet Z may be strictly3Sakarovitch (2009) prefers the term ?sequential?
for sub-sequential functions and the term ?pure sequential?
for se-quential functions.
While his arguments are reasonable (pp.651-2), we adopt the more widely adopted terminology.larger than X, and so z can be marked-up with ad-ditional symbols which carry additional informa-tion.4Finally, we review one important property ofsubsequential transducers and regular sets.
Forany function f : X?
?
Y ?
and x ?
X?, let thetails of x in f be defined asTLf (x) ={(y, v) | f(xy) = uv ?u = lcp(f(xX?))}.
(6)Every subsequential transducer T computing afunction f admits a canonical form, where thestates of T are in one-to-one correspondence withTLf (x) for all x ?
X?.Theorem 3 (Oncina et al1993) f ?

has finite cardinality.This theorem is the functional counterpart to theMyhill/Nerode relation.
Recall that for any set ofstrings L, the tails of a word w with respect to Lis defined as TLL(w) = {u | wu ?
L}.
Thisrelation partitions the set of all logically possiblestrings into a finite set of equivalence classes iffthe set L is regular.
These equivalence classes arethe basis for constructing the smallest determinis-tic acceptor for a regular language.Similarly, in the construction of the canonicalsubsequential transducer for a left subsequentialfunction, the states correspond to the sets of tailsdefined in (6) above.
There is a rich literature onsubsequential functions (Elgot and Mezei, 1965;Berstel, 1979; Oncina et al 1993; Mohri, 1997;Roche and Schabes, ; Sakarovitch, 2009).2.2 Weak DeterminismHere we introduce the notion of weak determin-ism.
Informally, these are regular functions whichdecompose into left and right subsequential func-tions as in Elgot and Mezei?s theorem but withoutthe mark-up given by the intermediate, larger al-phabet.
Thus, they are not necessarily determinis-tic, but they are ?more?
deterministic than regularfunctions where Elgot and Mezei decompositionrequires the intermediate mark-up.While the mark-up can be accomplished byintroducing new symbols (as done in Elgot and4Berstel (1979) provides an updated proof.

Table 1 showstwo allomorphs of the genitive suffix, [-in] and [-un].
The allomorph is predictable based on thefront/back dimension of the preceding vowel: ifthe preceding vowel is front then [-in] occurs, butif it is back then [-un] occurs.
(Turkish also hasrounding harmony, which is not shown here.
)Phonological analysis conceives of the phono-logical grammar as a function which maps anabstract lexical representation (the ?underlyingform?)
to a more concrete?but still abstract?phonological representation (the ?surface form?
)(Hyman, 1975; Kenstowicz, 1994; Hayes, 2009).Phonological transcriptions, like the ones in Ta-ble 1, represent surface forms.To illustrate, consider a simple phonologicalanalysis of the Turkish forms above, which positsthe underlying form of the genitive suffix to be/-un/ and a mapping f which derives the surfaceforms as shown in Table 2(a).
Table 2(b) describesthe mapping only in terms of the relevant detailswhere [+] indicates [+ back] vowels, [?]
indi-55cates [?back] vowels, and C consonants.Nevins?
(2010) analysis of vowel harmony uti-lizes underspecification.
We illustrate this conceptostensively with the Turkish example above.
In-stead of positing the underlying form of the suffixto be either /-in/ or /-un/, underspecification the-ory would posit it to be /-Vn/ where V is high,unrounded vowel unspecified for backness.
InNevins?
theory, underlying vowels which have fea-ture specifications can spread those features onlyto vowels unspecified for those features.
Under-specification is not congruent with research in Op-timality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 2004),which, by the principle of the rich base, requiresevery underlying form to be considered (includ-ing those where every vowel is fully specified).Gainor et al(2012) show that the iterative map-pings Nevins describes are subsequential, but thisdoes not address those theories (like OT) whichmay not consider underlying forms to permit un-derspecification.
All the vowel harmony patternsconsidered in this paper do not admit any under-specification whatsoever.A traditional view of vowel harmony analyzesvowel harmony patterns as either instances ofprogressive harmony (PH) or regressive harmony(RH).
Informally, progressive harmony means thevalue of a feature can be thought to spread fromleft to the right (as in the Turkish example above).Conversely, regressive harmony can be thought ofas spreading from right to left.
This is illustratedwith examples (a-d) in Table 3.Other theories of vowel harmony reject that di-rectionality is a primitive of the theory and arguethat vowel harmony is either dominant/recessive(DR) or stem-controlled (SC) (Bakovic?, 2000;Kra?mer, 2003) (see also (Archangeli and Pulley-blank, 1994)).
Dominant/recessive theories ana-lyze vowel harmony patterns by postulating that aparticular feature value of a harmonizing featureis the dominant one.
The DR function in Table 3identifies the [+] value as the dominant one; soany underlying representation containing the har-monizing feature with the value [+] will surfaceso that the harmonizing feature in all vowels willalso be [+].
Stem-controlled analyses are similarto dominant-recessive theories, however the fea-ture that spreads is determined not by its value butinstead by the morphological position of the vowelto which the feature belongs (for instance, is thevowel in a stem or affix?
).An additional complication is that variationsof the above functions are introduced by neu-tral vowels, which never undergo harmony.
Theycome in two kinds: transparent vowels which per-mit features to spread through them, and opaquevowels, which block the spread of harmony, buttrigger their own harmony domain.
Some effectsof neutral vowels are shown in rows (e-f) in Ta-ble 3.
(Symbols [?]
and [?]
are [?F] vowels thatare opaque and transparent, respectively.
Likewisewe use [?]
and [?]
to denote opaque and transpar-ent vowels which are [+F].
)Additionally, the phonological literature in-cludes discussion of logically possible, unattestedand unnatural vowel harmony patterns that arepredicted by classical approaches to vowel har-mony in OT.
These patterns include sour grapes(SG) (Padgett, 1995; Wilson, 2003) and major-ity rules (MR) (Lombardi, 1999; Bakovic?, 2000).Informally, SG is like progressive harmony ex-cept that vowels only harmonize if every vowelis guaranteed to harmonize.
For example, if anopaque vowel occurs after the trigger, no non-neutral vowel harmonizes with the trigger.
Ma-jority Rules instantiates the following rule: If thenumber of segments with ?F is greater than thenumber of segments with ?
?F , then segmentswith ?F are the triggers of harmony and segmentswith ?
?F are the targets and undergo change.Because phonologists consider SG and MR to bebizarre, they are referred to as ?pathologies?
(Wil-son, 2003; Wilson, 2004; Finley, 2008) and it is astrike against a theory if it predicts the existenceof either SG or MR.Henceforth, let X = Y = {+,?, C,?,?
}.These symbols represent equivalence classes of apartition of the phonemic inventory of any lan-guage which exhibits progressive harmony for thefeature F .
The symbols + and ?
represent theclasses of all harmonizing vowels which are +Fand ?F , respectively.
Phonemes invisible to har-mony are in the C class; this includes consonantsand transparent vowels.
The symbol ?
(?)
refersto opaque vowels which are +F (?F ), whichblock the spread of ?F (+F ), and which begins anew harmonic domain spreading +F (?F ).The vowel harmony mappings in this paper areall, in fact, same-length relations.
Furthermore,they are sequential.
These additional propertiesdo not appear to be shared by other phonologicalprocesses.

Forthis reason, we keep the analysis focused at thelevel of subsequentiality.4 The regular boundaryIn this section we show that the regular boundaryis sufficient to distinguish the pathological Major-ity Rules pattern from the attested progressive andregressive harmony patterns.Formally, MR functions can be defined as fol-lows.
Let |w|+F and |w|?F denote the number ofparticipating vowels (i.e.
non transparent vowels)which are +F and ?F , respectively, in w ?
X?.Then we define a Majority Rules Harmony patternas any same-length function which at a minimumobeys the following:MR(w) ={+|w| if |w|+F > |w|?F?|w| if |w|?F > |w|+F(7)The result below seems to be widely known (seeRiggle (2004, chapter 7, section 5)) though wehave not been able to find a proof in print.Theorem 4 Majority Rules is not regular.Proof By way of contradiction, suppose that MRis a regular relation.
Since regular relations areclosed under inverse, so is MR?1.
The image of aregular set under a regular relation is also a regularset (see Roche and Schabes (, pp.
41-43)).
There-fore, MR?1(+?)
is a regular set.
Since regularsets are closed under intersection, it follows thatMR?1(+?)?
(+???)
is regular as well.
Call thisset S.However, S is in fact not a regular set.

k and m + n = k and m > n.Furthermore, for all for all odd k, it is the casethat TLS(+k), includes ?n for all n < k ?
1but excludes ?n for all n > k + 1.
Thus there isa distinct Nerode-equivalence class for each oddk, and hence S is not a regular set, and thereforeMR is not a regular relation.
On the other hand, progressive and regressiveharmony are regular; in fact, subsequential.
Forconcreteness we analyze a canonical progressiveharmony pattern which includes neutral vowels.The subsequential transducer TPH in Figure 2faithfully captures the PH function.
Labels on thetransitions are interpreted as in Beesley and Kar-tunnen (2003): commas delimit multiple transi-tions; the label x:y means x is the input and y theoutput; absence of a colon means the input andoutput are identical.
The rightmost symbol inte-rior to a state is the output of the ?
function.While TPH presupposes languages have opaquevowels, it can be modified as needed to removethis assumption without losing subsequentiality.
Ifa language has no opaque vowels, those transi-tions can be removed.
Since any subgraph of thetransducer shown in Figure 2 is also subsequen-57tial, this establishes the left subsequentiality of it-erative, progressive harmony patterns without un-derspecification.6As for iterative regressive harmony patterns,they are simply the reverse of iterative progres-sive patterns.
In other words, for all w ?

?,RH(w) =??
?TPH .5 The subsequential boundaryIn this section we show that while the regularboundary is not sufficient to separate the patho-logical Sour Grapes pattern from attested harmonypatterns, the subsequential boundary is sufficient.Padgett (1995) defines Sour Grapes Harmonyas ?Either all features must spread, or nonewill.

For concreteness, consider a progressiveSour Grapes pattern.
The form +???
would bemapped to ++++ as in progressive harmony, butthe form + ?
??
is mapped to + ?
??
becausethe opaque vowel will not become +F , and so thespreading process grumpily chooses not to spreadat all.
Therefore, a progressive Sour Grapes Har-mony pattern is defined as any length-preservingfunction which at a minimum includes the follow-ing mappings for all n ?
N:SG(+?n) = ++n?SG(+?n?)
= +?n?
(8)There is a finite state transducer which describesthis fragment of the SG function, shown in Fig-ure 3.
As a total function, for SG to be regular, itis important that the image of the complement of?n?N{+?n} ?n?N {+ ?n ?}
under SG also beregular.
Pictorially, this would mean that the frag-ment shown in Figure 3 is a subgraph of the fullSG pattern.
Crucially, however, there can also beno transition from state 2 bearing the input symbol?
that can lead (even eventually) to a final state.We now prove the main theorem of this paper.Theorem 5 SG is neither left nor right subse-quential.Proof We show that, for all distinct n,m ?
N,the tails of +?n is not the same as the tails of+?m.
This immediately implies that the canon-ical left subsequential transducer would have in-finitely many states, and hence that any SG patternmeeting Equation 8 is not left subsequential.6It is true that TPH does not model progressive harmonypatterns where transparent vowels can trigger harmony.
Itis not difficult to modify TPH to accommodate this withoutsacrificing subsequentiality.0 1 23 4+ ?:+???

Observe that (?,+n) 6?TLSG(+?)
for all n 6= 2 since SG is length-preserving.More generally it is the case that (?,+n+1) ?TLSG(+?n) and (?,+m) 6?
TLSG(+?n) for allm 6= n + 1.
Therefore there are infinitely manydistinct sets of tails for functions conforming to(8), and thus no SG pattern is subsequential.A similar argument (omitted) establishes thatany SG pattern is not right subsequential.
Consequently, the subsequential boundary sepa-rates SG and MR from PH and RH.6 The weakly deterministic boundaryAs mentioned earlier, the dominant/recessive andstem-control theories of vowel harmony reject thedirectionality generalizations inherent in the PHand RH mappings.
If these theories are correct,then it is important to see what boundary (if any)separates MR and SG from vowel harmony pat-terns described with dominant/recessive and stem-control based generalizations.
We show that themappings these theories posit are, like SG, notsubsequential.
However, we believe there is aninteresting complexity difference between SG onthe one hand and DR and SC on the other.
In par-ticular, we show that DR and SC are weakly de-terministic.
We conjecture that SG is not weaklydeterministic and provide the intuition behind thisconjecture, though its proof currently escapes us.A dominant/recessive analysis of vowel har-mony says if the word contains the dominant valueof the harmonizing feature, then other vowels inthe word take on the dominant value for this fea-ture.
For example, if the [+] value for harmoniz-ing feature F is the dominant one and an under-58lying representation contains a vowel specified as+F, then all other non-neutral vowels in the wordwill be realized as +F as well.Therefore, we can define a function as dom-inant/recessive as any length-preserving functionwhich includes the following mappings:?w ?
{+,?

To find its tails we mustknow lcp(DR(?

Since DR(?

X?
)includes elements ?
?
?
and + + + (mappedfrom e.g.
?

?
and ?

), it fol-lows that lcp(DR(+ ?

= ?.
Therefore,(?,?

Observe that for alln 6= 2, it is the case that (?,+n) 6?
TLDR(??

?.
To find its tails wemust know lcp(DR(???X?)).
DR(???X?
)includes elements ????
and ++++ (mappedfrom e.g.
?
?
??
and ?
?
?+, resp.
), andso again the longest common prefix is ?.
There-fore, (?,++++) belongs to TLDR(???)
and(?,+n) 6?
TLDR(+?)
for all n 6= 3 since DRpreserves string lengths.More generally for all distinct n,m ?
N itis the case that (?,+n+1) ?
TLDR(?n) and(?,+m) 6?
TLDR(+?n) for all m 6= n + 1.Therefore there are infinitely many distinct sets oftails for functions conforming to (9), and thus noDR pattern is subsequential.A similar argument (omitted) establishes thatany DR pattern is not right subsequential.
On the other hand, DR is weakly determinis-tic.
We establish this for the case when the al-phabet contains only {+,?}.
In fact, DR is sim-ply the composition of progressive harmony andregressive harmony where only the dominant fea-ture value spreads.
Figure 4 shows a subsequen-tial transducer TPHP describing a progressive har-mony function where only [+] spreads.
Observe0,?1,?2,?

:+Figure 4: The subsequential transducer TPHPwhich recognizes iterative, progressive harmonywhere only the + value spreads.that the transducer in Figure 4 is nearly identicalto TPH in Figure 2 without the opaque vowels andthe C symbol.
The important difference is that inFigure 2 there is a transition from state 1 to itselfwhich reads a [+] input and outputs a [?
], but inFigure 4, the transducer in state 1, upon readinginput [+] transitions to state 2 and writes out [+].Let PHP denote the function TPHP computes.Theorem 7 DR is weakly deterministic.Proof We show that for all w ?

?TPHP (w).Case 1.
There exists 0 ?

|w| such that wi =+.
Then DR(w) = +|w|.
It follows from thedefinition of PHP that for all j ?
i, wj =+.
Letting u = PHP (w)r , it follows thatu1 = +.
Thus PHP (u) = +|w|.
The reverseof +|w| is clearly itself.
Therefore, PHP r ?PHP (w) = +|w|.Case 2.
Case 1 does not hold.
Then DR(w) =?|w|.
By definition, PHP (w) = ?|w|.Clearly then PHP r ?
PHP (w) = ?|w|.Since DR = ???

?TPHP isnot length-increasing, the theorem is proved.
While, the proof of theorem 7 is limited to wordsin {+,?
}?, we believe the extension to words in{+,?, C,?,?}?
is only challenging technically,and not conceptually.
For example, the definitionof DR harmony above in Equation 9 should bemore articulated so that, for instance, DR(?????+?????)

?.Stem-controlled analyses are similar todominant/recessive theories.
Unlike domi-nant/recessive theories, however, the vowelswhich trigger harmony are the ones which belongto the morphological stem.

(10)The analysis of SC is the same as DR; and sothe proofs are omitted.Theorem 8 SC is neither left nor right subsequen-tial.Theorem 9 SC is weakly deterministic.We believe there is a difference between DRand SG: we conjecture that SG is not weakly de-terministic.
To get an intuition why, considerthe two subsequential transducers A and B inFigure 5.
Limiting our attention to the domain{+?n}?

This is possible because these func-tions make use of an additional symbol [ ??

We are doubtful that it ispossible to decompose SG into a left and right de-terministic function where the left function is pro-0,?

may come from (Mohri, 1997), buried onpage 279.
He writes without elaboration or cita-tion ?Most phonological and morphological rulescorrespond to p-subsequential relations.?
Thisstudy suggests that Mohri?s assessment is largelycorrect, though the complete picture is more com-plicated than Mohri?s offhand comment indicates.The more complicated picture with respectto vowel harmony is expressed in Figure 6,which summarizes this paper?s contributions.Traditional directional theories of vowel har-mony express simpler generalizations thandominant/recessive/stem-control theories.
It isour opinion that future work will likely showthat even the weakly deterministic boundarysurely separates the pathological patterns from theattested ones.60Non-regular RegularWeakly deterministicLeftSubsequentialRightSubsequential?

?Figure 6: Hierarchies of transductions with the results of this paper shown.
PH=progressive harmony,RH=regressive harmony, DR=dominant/recessive harmony, SC=stem control harmony, SG=sour grapesharmony, and MR=majority rules harmony.Although the harmony patterns in this paper areall describable with same-length relations, we de-liberately chose not to focus on the special prop-erties same-length relations engender.
This islargely because there are phonological processessuch as epenthesis and deletion which are notsame-length, and we would like our conclusionsto hold for all phonological patterns.
Nonetheless,future work which explores the same-lengthnessaspect may lead to some interesting insights.
Onereviewer of this paper conjectured, for example,that if the same-length relations were coded as lan-guages that they would then be k-reversible (An-gluin, 1982).With respect to learnability, total subsequentialfunctions are identifiable in the limit from posi-tive data (Oncina et al 1993), though this algo-rithm appears to require data points unavailablein natural language corpora (Gildea and Jurafsky,1996).
Investigating subclasses of subsequentialfunctions which cover attested phonological pat-terns may thus not only better characterize possi-ble phonologies, but may also provide insights forlearning (Chandlee and Koirala, 2013).Finally, we believe Elgot and Mezei?s theoremcan shed new light on the old problem of abstract-ness in phonology (Hyman, 1970), and suspect ahierarchy of complexity depending on how muchmarkup (either new symbols or with a length-increasing function) needs to be introduced in theintermediate alphabet to order to decompose a reg-ular function into left and right subsequential ones.Computational work whose results should be morecarefully investigated with this in mind includeKempe (2000) and Crespi Reghizzi and San Pietro(2012).AcknowledgmentsWe thank the three anonymous reviewers for theirinsightful comments.
