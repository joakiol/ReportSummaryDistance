Example-Based Sense Tagging of Running Chinese TextXiang TongChang-ning HuangCheng-ming GuoComputer Science DepartmentTsinghua UniversityBeijing, CHINAPhone: +86-1-2594895Fax: +86-1-2562768ABS7"RACTThis paper describes a sense tagging technique for the auto-matic sense tagging of running Chinese text.
The system takes asinput running Chinese text, and outputs sense disambiguatedtext.
Whereas previous work (Yarowsky, 1992; Gale, et al ,1992, 1993) relies heavily on the role of statistics, the presentsystem makes use of Machine Readable/Tractable Dictionaries(Wilks, et al , 1990; Guo, in press) and an example-based rea-soning technique (Nagao, 1984; Sumita, et al , 1990) to treatnovel words, compound words, and phrases found in the inputtext.Key words: sense tagging1.
IntroductionIf the 1980's were characterized by the surge of efforts on Machine Read-able/Tractable Dictionary (MRD/MTD) research, the 1990's would be a timeof massive efforts on constructing annotated text corpora.
Properly annotatedtext corpora could form, at least, the bases for the following:a. the core of commercial information systems;b. the kernel engine of 'Cognitive Agents' ;c. the essentials of systems vital to national security.Sense tagging of large text corpora has been on the back-burner for too102long.
The preparation of large annotated text corpora, especially those withword sense disambiguated, has always been brushed aside for some piteous'smart '  approaches to prevail.
However, it is just this kind of hopeless clever-ness that handicapped the speedy growth of the language nterprise.
Fortunate-ly, more and more researchers have come to realize the importance, as well asthe necessity, of being earnest in annotating large text corpora of all major lan-guages.The present discussion presents a system for the automatic sense tagging ofrunning Chinese text - -  a necessary mechanism for the construction of anno-tated 'Monitor Corpora ~ (Sinclare, 1991) that do not degrade over time.
Thesystem takes as input running Chinese text, and outputs sense disambiguatedtext.
Whereas previous work (Yarowsky, 1992; Gale, et al , 1992, 1993) re-lies heavily on the role of statistics, the present system makes use of MachineReadable/Tractable Dictionaries (Wilks, et al ,  1990; Guo, in press) and anexample-based reasoning technique (Nagao, 1984; Sumita, et a l .
,  1990) totreat novel words, compound words, and phrases found in the input text.
Thefocus of this discussion is on the example-based reasoning technique.
The exam-ples that support the tagging operation come from the system MTD.The sense tagging system assigns a unique number for every Chinese charac-ters occurred in the text.
In most cases, the senses tagged are word senses.
Thisis due to the fact that most Chinese characters are words.
For example, '~\]"(beat) has 26 senses.
'~ '  (drum) has 6 senses.
The phrase '~\]'\]~l~' (beatdrums) becomes '~\]'-B02 \]lYE_A01' after sense tagging.
However, not all Chi-nese characters are words.
Sometimes they are bound morphemes.
In these cas-es, the senses tagged are the meanings of the morphemes as given in the dictio-nary.
For example, '~\]'~ as in '~IB\]'"~.~  , '\]~\]'~' is tagged 'A01 ' ,  which is thenumber of '~ '  as given in the MTD when 'II~ ~ is used as a prefix, i. e. , abound morpheme.2.
Overview of tile Sense-Tagging SystemThe sense-tagger under discussion represents partial results of some threeyears of continued efforts on the part of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China tobuild systems for the processing of general, unrestricted running Chinese texts.The system was implemented in ' C ' ,  and currently runs on the Sun Workstationat the National AI Laboratory in the University.2.
1.
ResourcesThe sense-tagging module uses two MRDs and one MTD.
The first MRD,103for the sake of discussion, say MRD-I , is  'tP~'l~'?.7,.i~-i~:-~::gtg' (Fu, 1987).
Itcontains about 6,000 one-syllable words, e. g. , '~ '  (beat), '~ '  (drum),and 43,000 compound words and phrases, e.g. '
:Ff~' (beating drums).
Eachword has one or more word senses.
For example, ':tq' (beat) has 26 senses and'~fi\[' (drum) 6.
Note that capital etters in the numbers tagged indicate homo-graphs, and the Arabic numbers the sense number under the homograph.
Thecontent of the word ':\]q' (beat) is given as following:~_A01 : Rig ,+---+nq--~:fJ_B01: ~\ ] ' ,  YX~\]" :~\]'_B02, ~-~--~:I$~_-~~Z~~_B03: {~, ~:  :~\]'_B04: :~:~'{$._hl~..~.~JJ{"g{\]'_B05: ~d/,  i#~ {\]'_B06: ~.,~:~, ,..~{\]'_B07: ~'~,~, ~,  g~ ~_BO8: ~,~~_B09: ~(~=m~) ~_BI0: ~, ~:~_Bi3:  ~ ~_BI4: ~j~_, ~~Y-BI5: ~ - ~ ) ~ ~  ~\]'_Bi6:{\]'_BI9: ~\]',~(~3,'I~) {\]'_B20: ~-~{\]'_B23: ~\[~ {\]'_B24: ~,~q-B25: :~ III1., ~ i~ ~ ~1 :~.
~~ ~ ~The second MRD, for the sake of discussion, say MRD-2,  is the Chinesethesaurus '~\] ~i~\]i~\]~0~' (Mei, 1983) with about 70,000 entries.
It has a 3-lev-el categorization system.
At Level 1, the dictionary has 12 major categories.
AtLevel 2, the 12 major categories split into 94 subcategories.
At the lowest level,Level 3, the dictionary has altogether 1,428 subcategories.
Under the currentnumbering system, the capital letter indicates major categories, the lower-caseletter subcategories, and the Arabic numbers the numbering under the two su-perordinate categories.
For example, 'Bp13' refers to one of the categories thatthe word '~ '  (drum) falls into.
B is a first level category, p is a second levelsubcategory, 13 is the numbering of the subcategory under Bp.
Partial list of thenumbering of some\categories s given as follows:104Bpl3 Fa0l Fa30 Ic05 ~ Hc26Be04 Bho5 ~ Bh07Fa23 Hdi 6 ~ Dm05~f  BOI3 ~ Bpl0~.~ ld03 ~.~ Iel4The MTD was constructed from MRD-1.
It has 43,000 annotated com-pound words and phrases.
Word phrases like '{T~rf~' (beating drums) are disam-biguated in the MTD with word sense numbers tagged to both '~J" (beat) and'~J~' (drum), e.g.
'~_B02 ~_A01 ' .
The numbers tagged are based on thenumbering system as used in MRD_ 1.
For those compounds that have compo-nent whose meaning is not related to the resultant compound, the Arabic num-bers in the component's tag is '00' (e.g.
, ~_A00 ~_A0\ ] ,  tO_A00t~_ A00).
Much of the work in constructing the MTD was done by machine,but supplemented by handcoding.
The following gives a partial list of the con-tents of the MTD :~T-BOl ~J_A03 ~\]'_B01 -~_A02 ~._B0\] ~\]'_B01~\]'_B02 ~_A02 ~\]'_B02 ~k._A01 ~\]'_B02 I'\]_A01~\]'_B03 ~j_A0I ~T-B03 ~_A01 ~qf_B05 i-A022.2.
Three-step Sense-tagging ProcedureStep 1 : Segmenting the inpul text into words, compound words and phrasesThe word segmentation module is a much simplied version of a more compli-cated segmentation program developed at the Laboratory.
It looks forwardthrough each sentence for maximum match of character strings as recorded in theMTD.
The tagging of most known phrases is done with the help of the MTD.
'{T~'  would be an example in question.
The involved operation is simple, i. e. ,'match to access'.
When an input segment matches an entry in the MTD, thetagged form of the matched segment replaces the input segment in the sentence.Step 2 : Example-based sense tagging o f  one-syllable wordsThe system uses an example-based sense-tagging algorithm for the disam-biguation of one-syllable words, which are not listed in system MTD.
The detailof the algorithm is described in Section 3.Step 3 : Default sense tagging o f  untagged one-syllable words from Step 2A default sense number is assigned to each and every one syllable word un-tagged from Step 2.
The default sense numbers are determined on the basis offrequency of occurrence data.1053.
Example-Based Sense-TaggingChinese words build to form compound words.
In 94.7 % of the time, themeaning of the resultant compounds i  related to the contributing meanings of thecomponent words (Zhang, 1986, p. 87).
The compound words and phrases inthe MTD contain implicit syntactic information for purpose of example-based rea-soning about the senses of Chinese words in context.For example, if ':~q" '~ '  (beat gongs and drums ) is in the input text andthe sense of ':~\]" (beat) cannot be determined.
In order to disambiguate theword sense of '{\]" (beat), the system looks through the MTD for every com-pound word and phrase beginning with '~\]" (beat) and decides that the phrases':~q'_B02 ~-A01 '  (beat drums) is an appropriate xample to reason about theword '~I '  (beat) as found in '?I ~ '  (beat gongs and drums),  since ' \ ]~'(drums) and '~  ~ '  (gongs and drums) are in the same lowest category'Bpl3'  in MRD_2.
The system then assigns the tag 'B02 ' ,  which belongs to'~\]" (beat) in '{\]'_B02 ~_A0 I '  (beat drums),  to '~\]" (beat) in '{\]" '~ '(beat gongs and drums).Formally, when S~ Sz"" S, represent input segments from 1 to n, W repre-sents an untagged segment, and the immediate context of I,,V is represented byL.
.
.
. '
- -  L2 Lt W R~ Rz""  R.o..., where L stands for ' Le f t ' ,  R stands for'R ight ' ,  and range equals 5, we have the following:St $2 "'" S. (a)where S, (k= 1, "" , n) is a word, compound word or phraseL,..,, ... L2 Ll W Rt R~ ... R, .
, ,  (b)where L,, R~(i= 1, "'" ,rmzge) is a word, compound word or phraseIn the forward reasoning process, assuming that (W R~) is a possible com-pound word or phrase, for all entries in MTD beginning with W which is in theform (W_tag  I tem),  the system computes the relatedness of the two words orphrases (W R,) and (W_tag  I tem),  where ' I tem' may be an annotated word,compound word, phrase, or just a meaningless Chinese character string.
Theconcept distance of R, and Item is computed to determine the relatedness of thetwo compound words/phrases.
Hence,Concept_Distance(R~, Item) =0 if R~ and hem are in the same lowest category in MRD_21 if R~ and hem are in the adjacent categories in MRD_ 2100 all other casesRelatedness( (W R,), (W_tag  I tem))  =1062 if Concept-Distance(R,, I tem) = 01 if Concept_Distance(Ri, I tem) = 10 if Concept_Distance(R,, I tem) = \] O0For every pair of (W R~) ( i= \ ] ,  ... , range)  and (W_tag  I tem)  in theMTD, the pair that has the greatest non-zero relatedness measure is determinedand the W in (b) above is substituted by the W_tag  in the determined pair.The reasoning process works similarly in both directions of W, i. e. , for-ward to R,o,t, and backward to L,~a,.
When the process proceeds forward, thesystem looks for entries beginning with W. On the other hand, when the processworks backwards to the left of W, the system looks for annotated entries in theMTD ending with W.The examples are given as following:(1) I~\]~,~J~ '1~ ~ ~~ *~*  ~ , ~  ~ ~ ~ ~~oThe word '~i '  (new) has six senses.
The annotated phrase '~-A01 ~_AOI ~ is found in the MTD.
The system calculates the conceptual distance be-tween '~i~' and '~ '  among others.
Since '~d~' and '~ '~ '  are found to be inthe same lowest subcategory 'Dd06' ,  the conceptual distance between them is0.
The system then assigns the tag 'A01 ' ,  which belongs to '~,ti:' as in 'j~-~:-A0I ~-A0 I ' ,  to '~i:' in the above sentence.The word '~ '  (receive, suffer) has six senses.
The annotated phrase'~-A02 ~'_A02'  is found in the MTD.
The system calculates the conceptualdistance between "/~" and '~ '~ '  among others.
Since '~"  and ' It~'~' arefound to be in the adjacent lowest subcategories, i. e. , 'HclS'  and 'Hcl9 '  re-spectively, the conceptual distance between them is 1.
The system then assignsthe tag 'A02 ' ,  which belongs to '~ '  as in '~_A02 ~ ' -A02 ' ,  to '~ '  in theabove sentence.
(3)  1~I~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~X ,~E ,~ ~ ~(g ~ ~P: ?~~ *~*  .The word ' /~ '  (right, power) has seven senses.
The annotated phrase'~_A01 ~:~-A01' is found in the MTD.
The system calculates the conceptualdistance between '~ '  and '~ '  among others.
Since 'g,.~ and 'g2J'~' arefound to be in the same lowest subcategory 'Dj03',  the conceptual distance be-107tween them is O.
The system then assigns the tag 'A01 ' ,  which belongs to'~ '  as in '~.~-A01 ~._A01 ' ,  to '~ '  in the above sentence.The word '$fl' (each other) has four senses.
The annotated phrase '$~-A01 ~,~_A01' is found in the MTD.
The system calculates the conceptual dis-tance between '~ '  and '~ I~ '  among others.
Since '~ '  and '~ '  are foundto be in the same lowest subcategory ' Jc01' ,  the conceptual distance betweenthem is 0.
The system then assigns the tag 'A01 ' ,  which belongs to '~l~' as in'#I~_A01 ~,_A01'  , to '}I~' in the above sentence.4.
Eva luat ionThe input Chinese texts that the present system works on are news releasetexts from the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency.
No preprocessing of thesenews release texts is required.The performance of the present sense-tagger is encouraging.
The hit rate ofcorrect sense tagging can run as high as 95 %.
The lowest hit rate ever recordedwas 70M.
The appendix gives a sample text which is the output of our system.The hit rate of correct sense tagging of this sample is 93.79M.
Essentially, thehit rate of correct sense tagging performed by the system is a function of the cov-erage of the system MTD and MRDs.5.
Limitations and Future Worka.
The system makes errors when the segmentation f the input texts is lessthan correct.
The performance of the current sense tagger can be improved ifmore sophisticated segmentation method is adopted.b.
Although the reasoning process takes advantage of collocational informa-tion within the phrase in which the untagged segment is a part, there is no guar-antee that the phrase does not have multiple meanings.
When such cases occur,the result of the reasoning is subject o chance.c.
The example-based sense tagging method works quite well with contentwords, but for function words it often makes faulty guesses.
This is partly dueto the fact that function words are less sensitive to context.
The current systemassigns a default sense number for most function words.
However, for thosewords which can both be a function word and a content word, the system oftenmakes errors.
This kind of errors decreases when the system preprocesses the in-put texts with a stochastic Chinese grammatical tagger like the one developed atTsinghua University (Bai, et al , 1992).1086.
Conci usionIn this paper we presented a relatively simple but effective method for thesense tagging of running Chinese texts.
The system takes advantage of the collo-cation information within the annotated compound words or phrases in the sys-tem MTD.
Considering that annotated Chinese texts constitute very useful re-sources for Chinese language processing, especially in generating frequency of oc-currence/co-occurrence data, general and special purpose concordances and thedata for the derivation of a natural set of semantic primitive for the Chinese lan-guage, the current sense-tagging system looks promising.
The room for progressis to be found in the further improvement of the system resources and the refine-ment of the reasoning algorithm.ReferencesBai, S-H, Xia, Y. , Huang, C-L. (1992) Research on Chinese grammaticaltagging method for Chinese corpus.
