268 Moore SchoolUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104Speakers of certain bilingual communities systematically produceutterances in whichthey switch from one language to another, suggest-ing that the two language systems syst~matically interact with eachother in the production (and reoognitlon) of these sentences.
Wehave investigated this phenomenon in a formal or computational frame-work which consists of two gramnatical systems and a mechanism forswitching between the two systems.
A variety of constraints apparentin these sentences are then explained in terms of constraints on theswitching mechanism, especially, those on closed class items.I.
INTRODUCTIONSpeakers of certain bilingual cc~nunities systematically produce utterances inwhich they switch from one language to another (called code-switching), possiblyseveral times, in the course of an utterance.
Production and comprehension ofutterances with intr~sentential code-switching is part of the linguistic eompe-tenoe of the speakers and hearers of these cc~nunities.
Much of the work oncode-switching is in the sociolinguistic framework and also at the discourselevel.
Recently ther~ have been few studies of code-switching within the scopeof a single sentence.
(See Sridhar (1980) for a good review, also Pfaff (1979)).Also until recently, this phenomenon has not been studio4 in a formal or computa-tior~.l framework.
(See Sankoff and Poplack (1980), Woolford (1980), Joshi (1980),and boron (1981).
Space does not permit a detailed comparison.
)The discourse level of code-switching is important, however, it is only at theintrasentential level that we are able to observe with some certainty, the inter-action between two Erammatical systems.
These interactions, to the extent theycan be systematically characterized, provide a nice framework for investigatingsome processing issues both fran the generation and parsing points of view.There are some important charscteristios of intrasentential code-switching whichgive hope for the kind of work described here.
These are as follows, i. Thesituation which we are concerned with involves participants who are about equallyfluent in both languages.
2.
Participants have fairly consistent judgementsabout the "acceptability" of mixed sentences.
(In fact it is amazing that parti-cipants have such acceptability judgements at all. )
3.
Mixed utterances arespoken without hesitation, paus.
es, repetitions, corrections, etc.
, suggestingthat intrasentential code-switching is not some random interference of one systemwith the other.
Rather, the switches seem to be due to systematic interactionsbetween the two systems.
4.
The two l~age  systems seem to be simultaneouslyactive.
5.
Intr~sentential code-switching is sharply distinguished from otherinterferences such as borrowing, learned use of foreign words, filling lexicalgaps,.etc, all of which could be exhibited by monolingual speakers.
6.
Despiteextensive intrasentential switching, speakers and hear~re usually agree on whichlanguage the mixed sentence is "ocraing from".
We call this language the matrix145146 A~.
JOSHI~s and the other language the embedded l~e .
These interesting charac- of the mixed sentences suggest that the two language systems are syste-matically interacting with each other in the production (and recognition) of themixed sentences.Our main objectives in this paper are (i) to formulate a system in terms of thegrammars of the two languages and a switching rule, (2) to show that a variety ofobservable constraints on intrasentential cede-switching can be formulated interms of constmaints on the switching rule.
The main result of this paper isthat a large ntm%ber of constraints can be derived from a general constraint onthe switchability of the so-called closed class items (determinizers, quantifiers,prepositions, tense morphemes, auxilliaries ~ helping verbs, complementizers, pro-nouns, etc.
).
This result is of interest because the differential behavior ofclosed class items (as compared to the open class items) has been noted invarious aspects of language processing (in the monolingual case), for example,(i) certain types of speech errors which strand the closed class items, (2) resis-tance to change as well as resistance to incGrporate new items as closed classitems, (3) frequency indpendent lexieal decision for closed class items (as com-pared to open class items for which lexical decision is frequency dependent), (4)the absence of frequency independence for closed class items in certain types ofaphasia, (5) closed class items aiding in ccm~prehension strategies, etc.
(Thislist is based on a talk given by Mary-Louise Kean at the University of Pennsylva-nia).
It is not clear what the relationship is between the behavior of closedclasses in intrasentential code-switching and the other behaviors (in monolingualsituations) described above.
We believe r however~ that investigating thisrelationship may give some clues concerning the organization of the granmar andthe lexicon, and the nature of the inter~ace between the two language systems.The examples in our paper are all from the language pair, Marathi (m) and English(e), Marathi (m) is the matrix language and English (e) is the embedded language.
(The coincidence of the abbreviation m for the matrix language, which is Marathiand e for the embedded language, whieJ~ is English, is accidental, but a happyone:~-.
A few facts about Marathi will be useful to note.
It is an Indo-Euro-pean language (spoken on the west coast of India near Bombay and in parts ofcentral India by about 60 million people).
It is an S0V language.
Adjectivesand relative clauses appear prencmirally and it has postpositions instead of pre~positions.
It uses a rich supply of auxilliary or helping verbs.
Other factsabout Mamathi will become apparent in the examples.
(See Section 3).2.
FORMULATION OF THE SYSTI~Let L m be the matrix language and L e be the embedded language.
Further let G m andGe be the corresponding grammars, i.e., Gm is the matrix ~rmmnaF and Ge.is theembedded ~ .
A "mixed" sentence is a sentence which contaLns lexlcal itemsfrom both L m and I e. Let L x be the set of all mixed sentences that are judged tobe acceptable.
Note that a mixed sentence is not a sentence of either L m or L e.However, it is judged to be "ccming f-rcm" im.
The task is to formulate a systemcharacterizing L x.
Our approach is.
to formulate a system for Lx in terms of Gmand Ge and a 'control structure' which permits shifting control from Gm to Ge butnot from G e to G m. We assume a 'correspondence' between categories of Gm and Ge,for example, NP m corresponds to NP e (written as NPm~NPe).
Control is shiftedby a switching r~le of the form(2.1) A m x A e, where Am is a category of Gin, Ae is a category of Ge, andAm =Ae.At any stage of the derivation, (2.1) can be invoked, permitting A m to be switchedto Ae.
Thus further derivation involving Am will be carried out by using rulesof Ge, starting with Ae.
The switching rule in (2. i) is as>mrnetric i.e.,switching a category of the matrix grammar to a category of the embedded gr~ummrINTRA-SENTENTIAL CODE-MIXING 147is permitted but not vice versa.
This asynmetry can be stated directly in therule itself, as we have done, or it can be stated as a constraint on a more gener-alized switching rule which Qill permit switching from Amto  A e as well as theother way rotund.
We have chosen to state the asyrgretry by incorporating it inthe rule itself because the asyn~netry plays such a central role in our formulation.This asygmetric switching rule together with the further constraints described inSection 3 is intended to capture the overpowering judgement of speakers about amixed sentence "coming from" the matrix language Lm.
The switching rule in (2.1)is neither a rule of GmnOr  a rule of G e. It is also not a rule of a grammar,say G x for Lx.
As we have said before, we will construct a system for L x interms Of Gmand G e and a switchingrule and not in terms of a third ~ ,  sayG x.
Although formally this can be done, there are important reasons for notdoing so.
Using this general framework we will now show that the system for L xcan be formulated by specifying a set of constraints on the switching rule (beside~the asyn~netry constraint).
These further constraints primarily pertain to theclosed class items.3.
CONSTRAINTS ON THE SWITCHING RULEOur hypothesis is that Lx can be completely characterized in terms of constraintson the switching rule (2.1).
The types of constraints can be characterized asfollows;3.1 Asyn~netry: We have already discussed this constraint.
In fact~we haveincorporated~t in the definition of the switching rule itself.
The main justi-fications for as!m~etry are as follows.
(a) We want to maintain the notion ofmatrix and embedded languageS and the asyrmnetry associated with this distinction.
(b) Arbitrarily long derivations would be possible, for example, by allowin~back and forth switching o fAmandAe along a nonbranchingpath.
Them appearsto be no motivation for allowing such derivations.
(c) The asymmtry constrainttogether with certain constraints on the non-switchability of closed class itemsseem to allow a fairly cGmplete characterization of L x.3.2 Constraint on switchability of certain categories: Rule (2.1) permitsswitching any category Am toA  e if Am~Ae.
However Certain categories cannot beswitched.
Although all major categorles can be switched, we must exclude theroot node S m. Obviously, if we permit Sm to be switched to Se, we can derivea sentence in Le starting with S m in a trivial manner.
Hence, we need thefollowing constraint.
(3.2.1) Root node Sm cannot be switched.Constraints on closed class items: (3.2.2) Certain closed class itemS such astense, ihx, and helping verbs when they appea~in"main VP cannot be sWitc/%eo.Examples: (underlined items in the examples are from Lm).
(3.1) mula khurcy~ rangawtat.boys ~ paint(3.2) mula khurcya paint kartat.~nse)In (3.2)the root verb has been switched fr~n Marathi to English.
The closedclass item tat is not switched, however it is attached to an auxilliary or help-ingverb ~-~--since it cannot be stranded.
This phenomenon'appears in mixedsentences-~other language pairs (see Pfaff(1979).
)It is not possible to switch both the V and the tense in (3.1), and also not theentire VP.148 A.K.
JOSHI( 3.3 ) ~mula khurcy_~a paint.
(3.4) emula paint chairs.Note that (3.4) could be derived by starting with S e (i.e., by starting to derivea sentence of le) and then switching VP e to VPm, but this is not permitted by theasyT~netry constraint.
Of course, one cannot start with the S e node because thisrequires switching S m toS e which is blocked by the constraint on the switchabilityof the root node.
(3.2.3) Closed class items (e.g., determiners, quantifiers, prepositions_,possessiye, aux, tense, helping verbs, etc. )
cannot be switched.
Thus, for example,DET m cannot be "swm~ched to DET e. This does ~ that a lexical item belong-ing to DET e cannot appear in the mixed sentence.
It can indeed appear if NP m hasalready been switched to NP e and then NP e is expanded into DETeN e according to Ge.
(3.5) kahi khurcya DETmNm (3.6) some chairs DETeN es-~66 ~(3.7) ~ chairs DETmN e (3.8) ~" some ~ ?~ DETeN mAdjectives are not closed classes; hence all four combinations below are possible.
(3.9) unca pe~i ~ (3.10) unc___aa box (3.11) tall ~ (3.12) tall boxNote that (3.12) is a Marathi NP m in which both the A m and N m have been switched.It is not derived fr~n NPe, if it were, it would have a determiner.
(Determineris optional in Marathi).Prepositions and postpositions are closed class items.
Marathi has postpositionswhile English has prepositions.

However,often we have a choice of a oomplementizer.
This choice depends both on thematrix verb V m and the embedded verb V e (V m ~ V e) to which V m has been switched.let the complementizerslof ym h~l C0MPm : \[ CI,IC2, C3}land the complementizers ofV e (~Vm) be COMPe= {CI, C 2, C 4} where CI~CI, C2~ C 2.
Now if V m is switched toV e i.e., the verb is lexically r~alized in the embedded language, then the choiceof the oomplementizer is constrained in the following manner.
Since complemen-tizers are closed classes, they cannot be switched.
Hence, the choice is CI, C 2 ,or C3; hQwever 9nly C1 and C 2 are permitted, as the equivalent lexical verb V epermits C i and C~ which are the eqgivalents of C\] and C 2 respectively.
C$ is notpermltted because its equlvalent C 3 ms not pertainS-ted for Ve, and C 4 whlch s theequivalent of C?
is not permitted because it is not allowed by V m. Thus the onlyoomplementizers that are permitted, if V m is switched to V e , are those that arepermitted by V m and the equivalents of which are permitted by V e (Vm.~Ve).
Thusthe choice is constrained not only to the complementizers of V m (because of nonswitchability of complementizers) but it is further constrained by the  choice ofcomplementizers of V e as explained above.+This is a problematic case which is discussed in detail in the longer versionof this paper.INTRA-SENTENTIAL CODE-MIXING 149Exa_:(3.22) tSgoing d~cides(3.23) * to perat  jayla__ ~_a.~.

Thus the only ecmplementizer that appears in the mixedsentence is ing.There are several interesting issues concerning the generation and recognitionof sentences such as (3.24) and (3.25).
For example, at what point the decisionto switch the main verb is made?
(We could have raised this issue earlier whenwe discussed (3.1) and (3.2)).
Since a new helping verb has to be introducedwhen the switch is made, does it mean that sc~e 'local' structural change has tobe made along with the switching of the verb?
Another point is that the choiceof the ccmplementizer (which canes before the matrix verb) also determines whetherthe verb can be switched or not.
The machinery we have provided so far may haveto be augmented to provide systematic answers to these questions.
Thus forexample, we may have to introduce additional constraints on the switching rules.4.
PARSING CONSIDERATIONSIn this paper, we have given an account of the const r~ts  on intrasententialcode-switching in a generative framework.
The formal model and the constraintson switching that we have proposed clearly have implications for the kind ofpar~er we may be able to construct.
We will not pursue this aspect in thispaper.
However, we would like to point out that by adopting some parsing stra-tegies, we can account for scme of the constraints described earlier.
A preliminary attempt was made in Joshi (1981) by proposing a strategy involving a so-called left corner constraint.
This stretegy has some serious drawbacks as waspointed out by Doron (1981).
She has proposed an alternate strategy called'early deter~nination strategy', according to which the parser tries to determineas early as possible the language of  the major constituent it is currently pars-ing.
Thus upon encountering a Marathi (m) determiner i.e., DET m the parserwould predict a Marathi NP m. The Marathi N m could be then realized lexically inMarathi or the Nm would be switched to N e and then lexically realized in English.NP m is expanded into DETmNomm where Nora m is expanded into AmN m.Note that A m and N m could be independently switched to A e and N e respectively,thus giving four possible sequences:DET m Am Nm, DET m A m Ne, DET m A e Nm, DET m A e Ne, all of whichare permissible.If the parser encountered an English determiner, i.e.
DET e then it would predictNPe, but now N e or AeN e into whichNPe can expand carrot be switched to N m or Am150 A.K.
JOSH|because of the asymmetry constraint.
Thus the only permissible sequence isDET e (A e) Ne, and the following are excluded, i.e., *DET e Nm, * DET e A e Nm~ * DET eAm Ne, * DET e A m Nm, which checks with the data.Of course, so far we have the same predictions as we had with the constraint onthe nonswitchability of closed class items.
However, there is some evidence tothe effect that a parsing strategy as described above may be in effect.
Thefollowing distribution is correctly predicted by the above strategy:(8.i) * tall pe~ya (5.2) tall boxes (5.3) unea pe~ya (5.4) unca boxes.
(5.1) is disallowed, because upon encountering an English adjective, Ae, the parserpredicts Nome, which is expanded into A e Ne.
However, N e cannot be realizedlexically in Marathi, unless N e is switched to Nm, which is disallowed.
Note that(S.l) cannot be disallowed by invoking nonswitchability of adjectives, becausethese are not closed classes.
This early determination strategy does not helphowever in accounting for the distribution of phrases involving postpositions (seeSection 3 ).Our conclusion at present is that the framework described in Section 3 along withthe constraints on closed class ite~as is the proper way to formulate the code-switching system.
A parsing strategy as diseussed above is perhaps also opera-tive (see Examples (5.1) - (5.4)) and when a closed class item is the leftmostconstituent of a major category then the two formulations made the same predictions.5.
CONCLUSIONWe have presented a formal model for characterizing intra-sentential code-switch-ing.
The main features of this model are that i) the model treats the two gram-mars (languages) asynmetrically, 2) there is no third gran~ar, and 3) the con-straints on the switchability of closed class items.
We believe that furtherinvestigation of code-switching in the proposed framework will be very productive,as it captures some essential aspects of intrasentential code,switching.
Anotherinteresting result concerns the role of closed class items.
Since several inpor~tant characteristics of closed class items are well-known in the context of pro-cessing of monolingual utterances, we think that further investigation of the roleof closed class items in the context of code-switching will give us some insightsinto the processing of monolingual utterances.
Our investigation of intra-sentential code-mixing can also be considered as a small contribution towards thelarger problem of determining the nature of the interface between the two languagesystems of a bilingual speaker or hearer.REFERENCESDoron, E., "On formal models of code:switching", MS., U. of Texas at Austin (1981).Joshi, A.K., "Some problems in processing sentences with intrasentential codeswitching", Extended Abstract of paper read at the U. of Texas Parsing Workshop,March 1981.Pfaff, C., "Constraints on language switching" Language, Vol.
