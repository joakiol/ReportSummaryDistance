The downside of this approachis the need for annotated training data, typi-cally generated in tedious manual, cost inten-sive work.
Distantly supervised approachesmake use of weakly annotated data, like au-tomatically annotated corpora.Recent work in the biomedical domainhas applied distant supervision for protein-protein interaction (PPI) with reasonableresults making use of the IntAct database.Such data is typically noisy and heuristicsto filter the data are commonly applied.
Wepropose a constraint to increase the qual-ity of data used for training based on theassumption that no self-interaction of real-world objects are described in sentences.In addition, we make use of the Univer-sity of Kansas Proteomics Service (KUPS)database.
These two steps show an increaseof 7 percentage points (pp) for the PPI cor-pus AIMed.
We demonstrate the broad appli-cability of our approach by using the sameworkflow for the analysis of drug-drug in-teractions, utilizing relationships availablefrom the drug database DrugBank.
Weachieve 37.31 % in F1 measure without man-ually annotated training data on an indepen-dent test set.1 IntroductionAssuming co-mentioned entities to be related isan approach of extracting relations of real-worldobjects with limited precision.
Extracting highquality interaction pairs from free text allows for?These authors contributed equally.building networks, e. g. of proteins, which needless manual curation to serve as a model for furtherknowledge processing steps.
Nevertheless, just as-suming co-occurrence to model an interaction orrelation is common, as the development of inter-action extraction systems can be time-consumingand complex.Currently, a lot of relation extraction (RE) sys-tems rely on machine learning, namely classifyingpairs of entities to be related or not (Airola et al,2008; Miwa et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2010).
De-spite the fact that machine learning has been mostsuccessful in identifying relevant relations in text,a drawback is the need for manually annotatedtraining data.
Domain experts have to dedicatetime and effort to this tedious and labor-intensiveprocess.Specific biomedical domains have been ex-plored more extensively than others, thus creatingan imbalance in the number of existing corporafor a specific RE task.
Protein-protein interactions(PPI) have been investigated the most, which gaverise to a number of available corpora.
Pyysalo et al(2008) standardized five PPI corpora to a unifiedXML format.
Recently, a drug-drug-interaction(DDI) corpus is made available in the same for-mat, originally for the DDI Extraction Workshop1(Segura-Bedmar et al, 2011b).As a consequence of the overall scarcity of an-notated corpora for RE in the biomedical domain,the approach of distant supervision, e. g. to auto-matically label a training set is emerging.
Manyapproaches make use of the distant supervision as-sumption (Mintz et al, 2009; Riedel et al, 2010):1Associated with the conference of the spanish societyfor natural language processing (SEPLN) in 2011, http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/DDIExtraction2011/35If two entities participate in a relation,all sentences that mention these two en-tities express that relation.Obviously, this assumption does not hold in gen-eral, and therefore exceptions need to be detectedwhich are not used for training a model.
Thomas etal.
(2011b) successfully used simple filtering tech-niques in a distantly supervised setting to extractPPI.
In contrast to their work, we introduce a moregeneric filter to detect frequent exceptions fromthe distant supervision assumption and make useof more data sources, by merging the interactioninformation from IntAct and KUPS databases (dis-cussed in Section 2.1).
In addition, we present thefirst system (to our knowledge), evaluating distantsupervision for drug-drug interaction with promis-ing results.1.1 Related workDistant supervision approaches have received con-siderable attention in the past few years.
However,most of the work is focusing on domains otherthan biomedical texts.Mintz et al (2009) use distant supervision tolearn to extract relations that are represented inFreebase (Bollacker et al, 2008).
Yao et al (2010)use Freebase as a source of supervision, dealingwith entity identification and relation extractionin a joint fashion.
Entity types are restricted tothose compatible with selected relations.
Riedel etal.
(2010) argue that distant supervision leads tonoisy training data that hurts precision and suggesta two step approach to reduce this problem.
Theyidentify the sentences which express the known re-lations (?expressed-at-least-once?
assumption) andthus frame the problem of distant supervision asan instance of constraint-driven semi-supervision,achieving 31 % of error reduction.Vlachos et al (2009) tackle the problem ofbiomedical event extraction.
The scope of theirinterest is to identify different event types withoutusing a knowledge base as a source of supervision,but explore the possibility of inferring relationsfrom the text based on the trigger words and de-pendency parsing, without previously annotateddata.Thomas et al (2011b) develop a distantly la-beled corpus for protein-protein interaction extrac-tion.
Different strategies are evaluated to selectvaluable training instances.
Competitive resultsare obtained, compared to purely supervised meth-ods.Very recent work examines the usability ofknowledge from PharmGKB (Gong et al, 2008)to generate training sets that capture gene-drug,gene-disease and drug-disease relations (Buyko etal., 2012).
They evaluate the RE for the three inter-action classes in intrisic and extrinsic experimentalsettings, reaching F1 measure of around 80 % andup to 77.5 % respectively.2 Resources2.1 Interaction DatabasesThe IntAct database (Kerrien et al, 2012) con-tains protein-protein interaction information.
It isfreely available, manually curated and frequentlyupdated.
It consists of 290,947 binary interactionevidences, including 39,235 unique pairs of inter-acting proteins for human species.2In general, PPI databases are underanno-tated and the overlap between them is marginal(De Las Rivas and Fontanillo, 2010).
Combiningseveral databases allows to cover a larger fractionof known interactions resulting in a more completeknowledge base.
KUPS (Chen et al, 2010) is adatabase that combines entries from three manu-ally curated PPI databases (IntAct, MINT (Chatr-aryamontri et al, 2007) and HPRD50 (Prasad et al,2009)) and contains 185,446 positive pairs fromvarious model organisms, out of which 69,600belong to human species.3 Enriching IntAct inter-action information with the KUPS database leadsto 57,589 unique pairs.4The database DrugBank (Knox et al, 2011)combines detailed drug data with comprehensivedrug target information.
It consists of 6,707 drugentries.
Apart from information about its targets,for certain drugs known interactions with otherdrugs are given.
Altogether, we obtain 11,335unique DDI pairs.2.2 CorporaFor evaluation of protein-protein interaction, thefive corpora made available by Pyysalo et al(2008) are used.
Their properties, like size and ra-tio of positive and negative examples, differ greatly,2As of January 27th, 2012.3As of August 16th, 2010.4Only 45,684 out of 69,600 human PPI pairs are availablefrom the KUPS web service due to computational and storagelimitations (personal communication).36Corpus Positive pairs Negative pairs TotalAIMed 1000 (0.17) 4,834 (0.82) 5,834BioInfer 2,534 (0.26) 7,132 (0.73) 9,666HPRD50 163 (0.38) 270 (0.62) 433IEPA 335 (0.41) 482 (0.59) 817LLL 164 (0.49) 166 (0.50) 330DDI train 2,400 (0.10) 21,411 (0.90) 23,811DDI test 755 (0.11) 6,275 (0.89) 7,030Table 1: Basic statistics of the five PPI and two DDIcorpora.
Ratios are given in brackets.the latter being the main cause of performance dif-ferences when evaluating on these corpora.
More-over, annotation guidelines and contexts differ:AIMed (Bunescu et al, 2005) and HPRD50 (Fun-del et al, 2007) are human-focused, LLL (Nedel-lec, 2005) on Bacillus subtilis, BioInfer (Pyysaloet al, 2007) contains information from various or-ganisms and IEPA (Ding et al, 2002) is made ofsentences that describe 10 selected chemicals, themajority of which are proteins, and their interac-tions.For the purposes of DDI extraction, the corpuspublished by Segura-Bedmar et al (2011b) is used.This corpus is generated from web-documents de-scribing drug effects.
It is divided into a trainingand testing set.
An overview of the corpora isgiven in Table 1.3 MethodsIn this section, the relation extraction system usedfor classification of interacting pairs is presented.Furthermore, the process of generating an automat-ically labeled corpus is explained in more detail,along with specific characteristics of the PPI andDDI task.3.1 Interaction ClassificationWe formulate the task of relation extraction asfeature-based classification of co-occurring enti-ties in a sentence.
Those are assigned to be eitherrelated or not, without identifying the type of re-lation.
Our RE system is based on rich featurevectors and the linear support vector machine clas-sifier LibLINEAR, which has shown high perfor-mance (in runtime as well as model accuracy) onlarge and sparse data sets (Fan et al, 2008).The approach is based on lexical features, op-tionally with dependency parsing features createdusing the Stanford parser (Marneffe et al, 2006).Lexical features are bag-of-words (BOW) and n-Methods P R F1Thomas et al (2011a) 60.54 71.92 65.74Chowdhury et al (2011) 58.59 70.46 63.98Chowdhury and Lavelli (2011) 58.39 70.07 63.70Bjo?rne et al (2011) 58.04 68.87 62.99Minard et al (2011) 55.18 64.90 59.65Our system (lex) 63.30 52.32 57.28Our system (lex+dep) 66.46 56.69 61.19Table 2: Comparison of fully supervised relations ex-traction systems for DDI.

)grams based, with n ?
{1, 2, 3, 4}.
They encom-pass the local (window size 3) and global (windowsize 13) context left and right of the entity pair,along with the area between the entities (Li et al,2010).
Additionally, dictionary based domain spe-cific trigger words are taken into account.The respective dependency parse tree is in-cluded through following the shortest dependencypath hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), byusing the syntactical and dependency informationof edges (e) and vertices (v).
So-called v-walksand e-walks of length 3 are created as well as ngrams along the shortest path (Miwa et al, 2010).3.2 Automatically Labeling a Corpus inGeneralOne of the most important source of publicationsin the biomedical domain is MEDLINE5, currentlycontaining more than 21 million citations.6 Theinitial step is annotation of named entities ?
inour case performed by ProMiner (Hanisch et al,2005), a tool proving state-of-the-art results in e. g.the BioCreative competition (Fluck et al, 2007).Based on the named entity recognition, only sen-tences containing co-occurrences are further pro-cessed.
Based on the distant supervision assump-tion, each pair of entities is labeled as related ifmentioned so in a structured interaction databases.Note that this requires the step of entity normaliza-tion.3.3 Filtering NoiseA sentence may contain two entities of an inter-acting pair (as known from a database), but doesnot describe their interaction.
Likewise, a sentence5http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6As of January, 2012.37may talk about a novel interaction which has notbeen stored in the database.
Therefore, filteringstrategies need to be employed to help in decid-ing which pairs are annotated as being related andwhich not.Thomas et al (2011b) propose the use of triggerwords, i. e., an entity pair of a certain sentence ismarked as positive (related) if the database has in-formation about their interaction and the sentencecontains at least one trigger word.
Similarly, anegative (non-related) example is a pair of entitiesthat does not interact according to the databaseand their sentence does not contain any triggerword.
Pairs which do not fulfil both constraints arediscarded.Towards improvement of the heuristics for re-ducing noise, we introduce the constraint of ?auto-interaction filtering?
(AIF): If entities from an en-tity pair both refer to the same real-world object,the pair is labeled as not interacting.
Even thoughself-interactions are known for proteins and drugs,such pairs can rarely be observed to describe aninteraction but rather are repeated occurences orabbreviations.
Moreover, the fundamental advan-tage of AIF is that it requires no additional manualeffort.3.4 Application on Protein-ProteinInteraction and Drug-Drug InteractionIn biomedical texts there are often mentions ofmultiple proteins in the same sentence.
However,this co-occurrence does not necessarily signal thatthe sentence is talking about their relation.
Hence,to reduce noise, a list of trigger words specific tothe problem is required.
The rationale behind thisfilter is that the interaction between two entities isusually expressed by a specific (trigger) word.
Forprotein-protein-interactions, we use the trigger listcompiled by Thomas et al (2011b)7.
In addition tousing IntAct alone, we introduce the use of KUPSdatabase (as described in Section 2.2).For drug-drug-interaction, to our knowledge,no DDI-specific trigger word list developed bydomain experts is available.
Therefore, filteringvia such term occurrences is not applied in thiscase.7http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/?thomas/pub/2011/iwords.txt4 ResultsIn this section, we start with an overview of state-of-the-art results for fully supervised relation ex-traction on PPI and DDI corpora (see Table 1).Furthermore, experimental settings for distant su-pervision are explained.
Finally, we present spe-cific results for models trained on distantly labeleddata, when evaluated on manually annotated PPIand DDI corpora.4.1 Performance overview of supervised REsystemsProtein-protein interactions has been extensivelyinvestigated in the past decade because of their bio-logical significance.
Machine learning approacheshave shown the best performance in this domain(e. g. BioNLP (Cohen et al, 2011) and DDIExtrac-tion Shared Task (Segura-Bedmar et al, 2011a)).Table 3 gives a comparison of RE systems?
per-formances on 5 PPI corpora, determined by doc-ument level 10-fold cross-validation.8 The use ofdependency parsing-based features increases theF1 measure by almost 4 pp.Table 2 shows results of the five best perform-ing systems on the held out test data set of theDDI extraction workshop (Segura-Bedmar et al,2011b).
In addition, the result of our system isshown.
Note that the first three systems use ensem-ble based methods combining the output of severaldifferent systems.The results presented in Table 2 and 3 give aperformance overview of the RE system used indistant learning strategies.4.2 Experimental SettingTo avoid information leakage and biased classifi-cation, all documents which are contained in thetest corpus are removed.
For each experiment wesample random subsets to reduce processing time.This allows us to evaluate the impact of differentcombinations of subset size and the ratio of relatedand non-related (pos/neg) entity pairs, having inmind the problem of imbalanced datasets (Chawlaet al, 2004).
All experiments are performed fivetimes to reduce the influence of sampling differ-ent subsets.
This leads to more reliable precision,recall, and F1 values.8Separating into training and validation sets is performedon document level, not on instance (entity pair) level.
Thelatter could lead to an unrealisticallly optimistic estimate(Van Landeghem et al, 2008)38AIMed BioInfer HPRD50 IEPA LLLP R F1 P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 P R F1(Airola et al, 2008) 52.9 61.8 56.4 56.7 67.2 61.3 64.3 65.8 63.4 69.6 82.7 75.1 72.5 87.2 76.8(Kim et al, 2010) 61.4 53.2 56.6 61.8 54.2 57.6 66.7 69.2 67.8 73.7 71.8 72.9 76.9 91.1 82.4(Fayruzov et al, 2009) 39.0 34.0 56.0 72.0 76.0(Liu et al, 2010) 54.7 59.8 64.9 62.1 78.1(Miwa et al, 2009) 55.0 68.8 60.8 65.7 71.1 68.1 68.5 76.1 70.9 67.5 78.6 71.7 77.6 86.0 80.1(Tikk et al, 2010) 47.5 65.5 54.5 55.1 66.5 60.0 64.4 67 64.2 71.2 69.3 69.3 74.5 85.3 74.5Our s.

Ratios aregiven in brackets.4.3 Protein-protein interactionWe explore four strategies to determine the impactof using additional database knowledge (IntActand KUPS) and to test the utility of our novelcondition (AIF).Table 4 shows the difference in retrieved num-ber of sentences and protein pairs, including thepercentage of positive examples in the whole dataset.
As expected, by using more background know-ledge, the number of sentences and instances re-trieved from MEDLINE rises.
An increase of bothnegative and positive pairs is observed, since arelevant sentence can have negative pairs alongwith the positive ones.
After applying additionalinteraction knowledge, the fraction of positive ex-amples (see 3rd column in Table 4) increases from15.5 % (IntAct) to 25 % (IntAct+KUPS).
However,employment of the AIF condition to both IntActand IntAct+KUPS strategies leads to a reductionof these values (e. g. fraction of positive examplesreduces from 15.5 % to 13 % and from 25 % to18.8 %).For simplicity reasons all runs are performedusing only lexical features.Table 5 shows the average values of distant super-vision experiments carried out for the PPI task.
Asignificant correlation between pos/neg ratio andprecision/recall holds.
This clearly indicates thetendency of classifiers to assign more test instancesto the class more often observed during training.In accordance with their class distribution, AIMedreaches highest performance in case of lower frac-tion of positive instances (i. e. 30 % or 40 %), whilefor IEPA and LLL the optimal ratio is in favor ofthe positive class (i. e. 70 % or 80 %).Comparative results of the distant learningstrategies IntAct and IntAct+KUPS tested on fivePPI corpora indicate that additional knowledgebases do not help per se.
Supplementary employ-ment of the KUPS database leads to a drop inperformances seen in four out of five test cases (adecrease of 1.7 pp in F1 measure is most notablyobserved in case of HPRD50).
However, introduc-tion of the novel filtering condition, in both strate-gies IntAct+AIF and IntAct+KUPS+AIF, showsa favorable effect on the precision and leads to anincrease of up to 6 pp in F1 measure, compared toIntAct and IntAct+KUPS.Applying AIF to the baseline IntAct increasesF1 measure of AIMed and HPRD50 from 34.4 %to 37.8 % and from 56.1 % to 59.1 %, respectively.An even larger impact is observed when compar-ing IntAct+KUPS and IntAct+KUPS+AIF.
ForAIMed, HPRD50 and IEPA an increase of around6 pp is achieved, while F1 measure of BioInferand LLL is improved around 3 pp.
Table 5 clearlyshows that IntAct+KUPS+AIF is outperformingother strategies in all five test cases by achiev-ing F1 measures of 39.0 % for AIMed, 52.0 % forBioInfer, 60.2 % for HPRD50, 63.4 % for IEPAand 69.3 % for LLL.Analysis of the database (IntAct+KUPS) pairsreveals that in total there are 5,550 (around 10 %)proteins that interact with themselves, with 4,918(89 %) originating from the KUPS database.
Thisindicates a number of instances that represent auto-interacting proteins which contribute to increase offalse positives.

More knowledge is beneficial, but only whenappropriate filtering of the data is applied.Distantly supervised systems outperformco-occurrence results for all five PPI corpora.Considering the best performing strategy(IntAct+KUPS+AIF), F1 measure of AIMed andBioInfer, for which we assume to have the mostrealistic pos/neg ratio, increased around 10 pp.HPRD50, IEPA and LLL have an improvement of5.5 pp, 5.2 pp and 2.9 pp respectively, due to highfractions of positive instances (leading to a strongco-occurrence baseline).Cross-learning9 evaluation may be more realis-tic to be compared to distant-learning than crossvalidation (Airola et al, 2008).
For AIMed andHPRD50 our approach performs on a par with Tikket al (2010) or better (up to 6 pp for BioInfer).4.4 Drug-drug interactionThe problem of drug-drug interactions has notbeen previously explored in terms of distant super-vision.
It is noteworthy that DDI corpora are gener-ated from web documents discussing drug effectswhich are in general not contained in MEDLINE.Hence, this evaluation corpus can be considered asout-domain and provides additional insights on therobustness of distant-supervision.
The AIF settingis not evaluated for the DDI task, because only 1of all 11,335 unique pairs describes a self interac-tion.
In MEDLINE, only 7 sentences with multiplementions of this drug (Sulfathiazole, DrugBankidentifier DB06147) are found.Table 6 gives an overview of the results for dis-tant supervision on DDI, with the parameter ofsize of the training corpus and the pos/neg ratio.
Aslight increase in F1 measure can be observed withadditional training instances, both in case of usingjust lexical features and when dependency basedfeatures are additionally utilized (e. g. (lex+dep)from 36.2 % (5k) to 37.3 % (25k) in F1 measure).Accounting for dependency parsing featuresleads to an increase of 0.5 pp in F1 measure, i. e.from 36.5 % to 37.0 % (10k) and 36.7%?

(25k)), the latter being our best result obtained forweakly supervised DDI.Compared to co-occurence, a gain of around18 pp is achieved.
Taking into account the highclass imbalance of the DDI test set (see Table 1),which is most similar to AIMed corpus, the F1measure of 37.3 % is encouraging.Figure 1 shows the results of PPI and DDI experi-ments in addition.
The error bars denote the stan-dard deviation over 5 differently sampled trainingcorpora.5 DiscussionThis paper presents the application of distant su-pervision on the task to find protein-protein inter-actions and drug-drug interactions.
The first isaddressed using the databases IntAct and KUPS,the second using DrugBank.More database knowledge does not necessar-ily have a positive impact on a trained model, ap-propriate instance selection methods need to beapplied.
This is demonstrated with the KUPSdatabase and the automatic curation via auto-interaction filtering leading to state-of-the-art re-sults for weakly supervised protein-protein inter-action detection.We present the first results of applying the dis-tant supervision paradigm to drug-drug-interaction.41The results may seem comparatively limited incomparison to protein-protein interaction, but areencouraging when taking into account the imbal-ance of the test corpus and its differing sourcedomain.Future development of noise reduction ap-proaches is important to make use of the full poten-tial of available database knowledge.
The resultsshown are encouraging that manual annotation ofcorpora can be avoided in other application areasas well.
Another future direction is the investiga-tion of specifically difficult structures, e. g. listingsand enumerations of entities in a sentence.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the reviewers for theirvaluable feedback.
