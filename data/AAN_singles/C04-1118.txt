It re-lays on shallow rule-based techniques asused in the Controlled Language Author-ing Technology (CLAT).
The paper outlinesmajor sources of gender imbalances in Ger-man texts.
It gives a background on theunderlying CLAT technology and describesthe marking and annotation strategy to au-tomatically detect and visualize the ques-tionable pieces of text.
The paper providesa detailed evaluation of the editor.1 IntroductionTimes of feminist (language) revolution aregone, but marks are left behind in the formof a changed society with a changed conscious-ness and changed gender roles.
Neverthelesslanguage use seems to oppose changes muchstronger than society does.
As the use of non-discriminatory language is nowadays compul-sory in administration and official documents, anumber of guidelines and recommendations ex-ist, which help to avoid gender imbalance andstereotypes in language use.
Although in somecases men may be concerned (as for examplemost terms referring to criminals are mascu-line nouns) the main concern is about adequaterepresentation of women in language, especiallyin a professional context.
Psychological testsdemonstrate that persons reading or hearingmasculine job titles (so-called generic terms al-legedly meaning both women and men) do notvisualize women working in this field.In order to avoid this kind of discriminationtwo main principles are often suggested (e.g.
asin (Ges, 1999; Uni, 2000)):1. use of gender-neutral language, whichrather ?disguises?
the acting person by us-ing impersonal phrases.2.
explicit naming of women and men asequally represented acting persons.Using and applying these guidelines in a faith-ful manner is time-consuming and requires agreat amount of practice, which can not al-ways be provided, particularly by unexperi-enced writer.
Moreover these guidelines are of-ten completely unknown in non-feminist circles.A tool which checks texts for discriminatory useof language is thus mandatory to promote writ-ten gender equality, educate and remind writerof unacceptable forms to avoid.In this paper we describe the project ?Gen-dercheck?
which uses a controlled-language au-thoring tool (CLAT) as a platform and editorto check German texts for discriminatory lan-guage.In section 2 we introduce three categories ofgender discrimination in German texts and pro-vide possibilities for their reformulation.Section 3 introduces the technology on whichthe Gendercheck editor is based.
The linguis-tic engine proceeds in two steps, a marking andfiltering phase where gender discriminatory for-mulations are automatically detected.
A graph-ical interface plots the detected formulationsand prompts the according messages for correc-tion .Section 4 then goes into the detail of themarking and filtering technique.
We use theshallow pattern formalism kurd (Carl andSchmidt-Wigger, 1998; Ins, 2004) first to markpossible erroneous formulations and the to filterout those which occur in ?gendered?
context.Section 5 evaluates the Gendercheck editor ontwo texts.2 Gender Inequality in GermanTextsMost prominent to achieve gender equality on alinguistic level in German texts is to find solu-tions and alternatives for the so-called genericmasculine: the masculine form is taken asthe generic form to designate all persons ofany sex.
The major problem is to figure outwhether or not a given person denotation refersto a particular person.
For instance, in ex-ample (1a) ?Beamter?
(officer) is most likelyused in its generic reading and refers to fe-male officers (Beamtinnen) and masculine offi-cers (Beamten).
To achieve gender equality anappropriate reformulation is required as shownin example (1b).
(1a) Der Beamte muss den AnforderungenGenu?ge leisten.
(1b) Alle Beamten und Beamtinnen mu?ssen denAnforderungen Genu?ge leisten.Since we tackle texts from administrative andlegal domains we principally assume unspeci-fied references.
That is, a masculine (or fem-inine!)
noun will not denote a concrete personbut rather refers to all persons, irrespectively oftheir sex.A second class of errors are masculine rela-tive, possessive and personal pronouns whichrefer to a generic masculine or an indefinite mas-culine pronoun.
(2a) Der Beamte muss seine Wohnung in derNa?he des Arbeitsplatzes suchen.
(2b) Jeder muss seinen Beitrag dazu leisten.
(2c) Wer Rechte hat, der hat auch Pflichten.The possessive pronoun ?seine?
(his) in exam-ple (2a) refers to the preceeding ?Beamte?
(of-ficer).
The generic masculine use of ?Beamte?and the referring pronoun will be marked.
Thesame holds for sentence (2b) where the posses-sive pronoun refers to the indefinite pronoun?jeder?
(everymasc).
The indefinite pronouns?jemand?
(someone) and ?wer?
(who) count asacceptable.
However, masculine pronouns refer-ring to it will be marked.
In example (2c), themasculin relative pronoun ?der?
can be omitted.A third class of gender inequality is lack ofagreement between the subject and the pred-icative noun.
Example (3a) gives an examplewhere the masculine subject ?Ansprechpartner?
(partnermasc) occurs with the a female object?Frau Mu?ller?
(Mrs.
Mu?ller).
(3a) Ihr Ansprechpartner ist Frau Mu?ller.
(3b) Ihre Ansprechpartnerin ist Frau Mu?ller.A solution for this class of errors is shown inexample (3b) where the subject (Ansprechpart-nerin) is adapted to the female gender of thepredicate.Suggestions to reformulate gender imbalancesas shown in examples (1) and (2) can be classi-fied in two main categories:1.
Whenever possible, use gender neutralformulations.
These include collectiva(e.g.
Lehrko?rper (teaching staff) orArbeitnehmerschaft (collective of employ-ees)) as well as nominalized participles(Studierende (scholar)) or nominalized ad-jectives (Berechtigte).2.
Use both forms if gender neutral formula-tions cannot be found.
That is, the femi-nine and the masculine form are to be co-ordinated with ?und?, ?oder?
or ?bzw.
?.A coordination with slash ?/?
will also besuggested but should only be used in forms,ordinance and regulations.Amendments should accord to general Ger-man writing rules.
The so called ?Binnen-I?, anupper case ?I?
as in ?StudentInnen?
will not besuggested and also naming of the female suffix inparenthesis should be avoided.
The same holdsfor the indefinite pronoun ?frau?
(woman) whichwas occasionally suggested to complement thepronoun ?man?.3 The Gendercheck EditorControlled-Language Authoring Technology(CLAT) CLAT has been developed to suit theneed of some companies to automatically checktheir technical texts for general language andcompany specific language conventions.
WithinCLAT, texts are checked with respect to:?
orthographic correctness?
company specific terminology and abbrevi-ations?
general and company specific grammaticalcorrectness?
stylistic correctness according to generaland company specific requirementsThe orthographic control examines texts fororthographic errors and proposes alternativewritings.
The terminology component matchesthe text against a terminology and abbreviationdatabase where also term variants are detectedFigure 1: The Gendercheck Editor(Carl et al, 2004).
Grammar control checksthe text for grammatical correctness and dis-ambiguates multiple readings.
Stylistic controldetects stylistic inconsistencies.The components build up on each other?soutput.
Besides the described control mech-anisms, CLAT also has a graphical front-endwhich makes possible to mark segments in thetexts with different colors.
Single error codescan be switched off or on and segments of textcan be edited or ignored according to the au-thors need.
CLAT also allows batch processingwhere XML-annotated text output is generated.Figure 1 shows the graphical interface of theeditor.
The lower part of the editor plots an in-put sentence.
The highlighted SGML codes aremanually annotated gender ?mistakes?.
Theupper part plots the automatically annotatedsentence with underlined gender mistakes.As we shall discuss in section 5, gender im-balances are manually annotated to make eas-ier automatic evaluation.
In this example, thehighlighted words ?Deutscher?
(German) and?EG-Bu?rger?
(EU-citizen) are identical in themanually annotated text and in the automat-ically annotated text.
The user can click onone of the highlighted words in the upper win-dow to display the explanatory message in themiddle part of the screen.
Further informationand correction or reformulation hints can alsobe obtained by an additional window as shownon the right side of the figure.
The messagesare designed according to main classes of genderdiscriminatory formulations as previously dis-cussed.4 Gender Checking StrategyGendercheck uses a marking and filtering strat-egy: first all possible occurrences of words inan error class are marked.
In a second step?gendered?
formulations are filtered out.
Theremaining marked words are assigned an errorcode which is plotted in the Gendercheck editor.According to the classification in section 2,this section examines the marking and filteringstrategy for generic masculine agents in section4.1, pronouns which refer to generic masculineagents (section ??)
and errors in agreement ofpredicative nouns (section ??
).Marking and filtering is realized with kurda pattern matching formalism as described in(Carl and Schmidt-Wigger, 1998; Ins, 2004).
In-put for kurd are morphologically analyzed andsemantically tagged texts.4.1 Class 1: Agents4.1.1 Marking AgentsTwo mechanisms are used to mark denotationsof persons:a) The morphological analysis of mpro(Maas, 1996) generates not only derivationaland inflectional information for German words,but also assigns a small set of semanticvalues.
Male and female human agentssuch as ?Soldat?
(soldier), ?Bu?rgermeister?
(mayormasc), ?Beamte?
(officermasc), ?Kranken-schwester?
(nursefem) etc.
are assigned a se-mantic feature s=agent.
Words that carry thisfeature will be marked style=agent.b) Problems occur for nouns if the baseword is a nominalized verb.
For instance?Gewichtheber?
(weightlifter) und ?Busfahrer?
(bus driver) will not be assigned the features=agent by mpro since a ?lifter?
and a ?driver?can be a thing or a human.
Gender inequalities,however, only apply to humans.
Given that thetool is used in a restricted domain, a special listof lexemes can be used to assign these wordsthe style feature style=agent.
The kurdrule Include shows some of the lexemes fromthis list.
The list contains lexemes to covera maximum number of words.
For instancethe lexeme absolvieren (graduate) will match?Absolvent?
(alumnusmasc), ?Absolventin?
(alumnusfem), ?Absolventen?
(alumniplu,masc)and ?Absolventinnen?
(alumniplu,fem).1 Include =2 Ae{c=noun,3 ls:absolvieren$;4 dezernieren$;5 richten$;6 fahren$;7 administrieren$;8 vorstand$}9 : Ag{style=agent}.Lines 3 to 8 enumerate a list of lexemes sep-arated by a semicolon.
The column in line3 following the attribute name ls tells kurdto interpret the values as regular expressions.Since the dollar sign $ matches the end of thevalue in the input object, each lexeme in thelist can also be the head of a compound word.Thus, the test ls:fahren$ matches all lexemesthat have fahren as their head words, suchas ?Fahrer?
(driver), ?Busfahrer?
(bus driver),etc.
The action Ag{style=agent} marks thematched words as an agent.4.1.2 Filtering ?gendered?
AgentsThe text then undergoes several filters to deletemarks in words if the appear within genderedformulations.a) Excluded are marked agents which preceeda family name.
The marking of ?Beamte?
inexample (4) will be erased since it is followedby the family name ?Meier?.
?Beamte Meier?is likely to have a specific reference.
(4) Der Beamte Meier hat gegen die Vorschriftversto?en.In terms of kurd this can be achieved withthe rule AgentMitFname: if a family name(s=fname) follows a sequence of marked agents(style=agent) the marks in the agent nodes areremoved (r{style=nil}).1 AgentMitFname =2 +Ae{style=agent},3 Ae{c=noun,s=fname}4 : Ar{style=nil}.b) Also excluded are nominalized plural ad-jectives and participles since they are wellsuited for gender neutral formulations.
In ex-ample (5), the nominalized plural adjective?Sachversta?ndige?
(experts) is ambiguous withrespect to gender.
The mark will thus be re-moved.
(5) Sind bereits Sachversta?ndige bestellt?c) Marked words in already gendered formu-lations are also erased.
Pairing female and maleforms by conjunction is a recommended way toproduce gender equality.
In example (6) thesubject ?Die Beamtin oder der Beamte?
(theofficerfem or the officermasc) as well as the pro-nouns which refer to it ?sie oder er?
(she or he)and ?ihrer oder seiner?
(her or his) are genderequal formulations.
(6) Die Beamtin oder der Beamte auf Lebens-zeit oder auf Zeit ist in den Ruhestandzu versetzen, wenn sie oder er infolgeeines ko?rperlichen Gebrechens oder wegenSchwa?che ihrer oder seiner ko?rperlichenoder geistigen Kra?fte zur Erfu?llungihrer oder seiner Dienstpflichten dauerndunfa?hig (dienstunfa?hig) ist.The kurd rule gegendert removes thesemarks.
The description in lines 2 to 5matches a conjunction of two marked agents(style=agent) which share the same lexemels=_L but which are different in gender.
Thislatter constraint is expressed in two variablesehead={g=_G} and ehead={g~=_G} which onlyunify if the gender features ?g?
have non-identical sets of values.1 gegendert =2 Ae{style=agent,ls=_L,ehead={g=_G}},3 e{lu=oder;und;bzw.
;/},4 *a{style~=agent}e{c=w},5 Ae{style=agent,ls=_L,ehead={g~=_G}}6 : Ar{style=nil}.The rule allows the conjunctions ?und?,?oder?, ?bzw.?
and ?/?.d) Some nouns are erroneously marked even ifno gender equal formulation is possible.
For in-stance words such as ?Mensch?
(human being),a?Gast?
(guest), ?Flu?chtling?
(refugee) are mas-culine in gender, yet there is no correspondingfemale form in German.
These words are in-cluded in an exclude list which works similarto the include list previously discussed.1 exclude =2 Aa{style=agent,3 lu:mensch$;4 flu?chtling$;5 sa?ugling$;6 gast$;7 rat$}8 : Ar{style=nil}.4.1.3 Non marked Expressionsa) Currently, we do not mark compound nounswhich have an agent as their modifier and anon-agent as their head.
However, also wordssuch as ?Rednerpult?
(talker desk = lectern)and ?Teilnehmerliste?
(participants list = listof participants) are suitable for gender main-streaming and should be spelled as ?Redepult?
(talk desk) and ?Teilnehmendeliste?
(participat-ing list).b) We do not mark articles and adjectiveswhich preceed the marked noun.
This wouldbe troublesome in constructions like example(7) where the article ?der?
(the) and the cor-responding noun ?Dezernent?
(head of depart-ment) are separated by an intervening adjectivalphrase.
(7) Den Vorsitz fu?hrt der jeweils fu?r dieAufgaben zusta?ndige Dezernent.c) It is currently impossible to look beyondthe sentence boundary.
As a consequence, thereference of a agent cannot be detected if it oc-curs in the preceeding sentence.
For instance?Herr Mu?ller?
is the reference of ?Beamte?
inthe second sentence in example (8).
(8) Herr Mu?ller hat die Dienstvorschrift ver-letzt.
Der Beamte ist somit zu entlassen.The word ?Beamte?
will be erroneouslymarked because information of the preceedingsentence is not available to resolve the reference.4.2 Class 2: PronounsAlso personal pronouns, possessive pronouns,relative pronouns and indefinite pronouns aremarked.
The strategy is similar to the one foragents above: first all pronouns are marked andin a second step markings in correct formula-tions are erased.With the exception of indefinite pronouns(?Mancher?, ?Jemand?, ?Niemand?
etc.
), amarked referent agent must be available in thesame sentence.
Three different rules are used tomark relative pronouns, personal pronouns andpossessive pronouns.1 MarkRelativPronomen =2 e{style=agent,ehead={g=_G}},3 *a{lu~=&cm},4 e{lu=&cm},5 Ae{lu=d_rel,ehead={g=_G}}6 : Ag{style=agent}.a) The rule MarkRelativPronomen detects amarked agent in line 2.
Lines 3 and 4 searchthe next comma1 that follows the marked agentand line 5 matches the relative pronoun2 thatimmediately follows the comma.
The relative1commas are coded as ?&cm?
in the formalism.2relative pronouns are assigned the lexeme ?d rel?.Size of Test Classes of errorsText #sent.

116pronoun must agree in gender with the agent(ehead={g=_G}).
As we shall see in section 5,this is an error prone approximation to referencesolution.b) Personal and possessive pronouns areonly marked if they refer to a male agent.The two rules MarkPersonalPronomen andMarkPossesivPronomen work in a similar fash-ion: in line 2 the marked masculine referenceis matched.
Lines 3 and 4 match the follow-ing personal pronoun (c=w,sc=pers) and pos-sessive pronoun (c=w,sc=poss).
In lines 5, thepronouns are marked.1 MarkPersonalPronomen =2 e{style=agent,ehead={g=m}},3 1Ae{lu=er;er_es,c=w,sc=pers}4 |e{s~=agent,sc~=punct}5 : Ar{style=agent}.1 MarkPossesivPronomen =2 e{style=agent,ehead={g=m}},3 1Ae{lu=sein,c=w,sc=poss}4 |e{s~=agent,sc~=punct}5 : Ar{style=agent}.After the marking step, pronoun marks arefiltered.
Filtering of pronouns is similar to thepreviously discussed rule gegendert.4.3 Class 3: Predicative NounMissing agreement between subject and pred-icative noun is detected with the following kurdrule:1 Praedikatsnomen =2 +Ae{mark=np,style=agent,ehead={g=_G}},3 *Ae{mark=np},4 e{ls=sein,c=verb},5 *Ae{style~=agent},6 Ae{mark=np,style=agent,ehead={g~=_G}},7 *Ae{mark=np}8 : Ar{bstyle=Gen3,estyle=Gen3}.Lines 2 and 3 detect the marked subject.
No-tice that noun groups are marked with the fea-ture mark=np by a previous chunking module.Lines 5 to 7 match the predicative noun.
Bothparts of the sentence are connected by the cop-ula ?sein?
(be).
Similar to the rule gegendert,the rule only applies if both parts are differentin gender.5 Evaluation of GendercheckWe evaluated the Gendercheck editor based ontwo texts:ET1 A collection of unconnected negative exam-ples taken from the (Ges, 1999) and (Sch,1996).TT2 The deputy law of the German BundestagGender imbalances were manually annotatedwith a SGML code, where each different coderefers to a different rewrite proposal to be plot-ted in the editor as in the lower part in fig-ure 1.
Table 4.1.3 shows the distribution of er-ror classes in the two texts.
Each error classhad several subtypes which are omitted here forsake of simplicity.In ET1 every sentence has at least one er-ror; on average one word out of six is markedas ?ungendered?.
Since ET1 is a set of negativeexamples, errors are uniformly distributed.
Dis-tribution of errors in text TT2 is different fromET1.
TT2 does not contain a single occurrenceof a class 3 error.
On average, only one wordout of 60 is manually marked and ?
due to thelong size of sentences ?
there are 0.46 errorsper sentence on average.Text ET1 was used to develop and adjust thekurd rule system for marking, filtering and er-ror code assignment.
We iteratively comparedthe automatically annotated text with the man-ually annotated text and computed precisionand recall.
Based on the misses and the noise,we adapted the style module as well as the errorannotation schema.
Thus, in a first annotationschema we assigned more than 30 different er-ror codes literally taken from (Ges, 1999) and(Uni, 2000).
However, it turned out that thiswas too fine a granularity to be automaticallyreproduced and values for precision and recallwere very low.
We than assigned only one er-ror class and achieved very good values for pre-cision of over 95% and recall over more than89%.
Based on these results we carefully re-fined a number of subtypes of the three errorclasses.Final results are shown in table 5.
Results forthe test text TT2 are slightly inferior to those ofText ET1Error hit misses noise precision recallClass 1 85 12 1 0.988 0.876Class 2 55 7 5 0.917 0.887Class 3 15 0 1 0.937 1.000?155 19 7 0.957 0.891Text TT2Class 1 86 9 5 0.945 0.905Class 2 14 7 4 0.778 0.667?

We briefly discusstypical instances of misses and noise.a) Noise in class 1 (generic use of masculine)are mainly due to ?-ling?
- derivations such as?Abko?mmling?
(descendant) which are mascu-line in German and for which no female equiva-lent forms exist.
These words could be includedin the exclude lexicon (see section 4).b) In some cases nominalized participlessuch as ?Angestellte?
(employee) and ?Hin-terbliebene?
(surviving dependant), which areusually very well suited for gendered formula-tions due to their ambiguity in gender, were er-roneously disambiguated.
These instances pro-duced noise because filters did not apply.c) Misses in class 1 can be traced back tosome words which have not been detected ashuman agents such as ?Schriftfu?hrer?
(recordingclerk) and ?Ehegatte?
(spouse).
These wordscould be entered into the include lexicon.
Bothlexicon should be made user-adaptable and userextendible in future versions of the system.d) Many of the misses in class 2 are due to areference in the preceeding sentence.
Since thesystem is currently sentence based, there is noeasy solution in enhancing this type of errors.The possessive pronoun ?seiner?
in the secondsentence of example (9) refers to ?Bewerber?
(applicant) in the first sentence.
This connectioncannot be reproduced if the system works on asentence basis.
(9) Einem Bewerber um einen Sitz im Bun-destag ist zur Vorbereitung seiner Wahl in-nerhalb der letzten zwei Monate vor demWahltag auf Antrag Urlaub von bis zu zweiMonaten zu gewa?hren.
Ein Anspruch aufFortzahlung seiner Bezu?ge besteht fu?r dieDauer der Beurlaubung nicht.e) An example for noise in class 2 is shownin example (10).
The relative pronoun ?der?
(who,which) was detected by Gendercheck buterroneously been linked to ?Beamte?
instead of?Antrag?
(application) which are both masculinin German.
(10) Der Beamte ist auf seinen Antrag, der bin-nen drei Monaten seit der Beendigung derMitgliedschaft zu stellen ist, .
.
.Much more powerful mechanisms are requiredto achieve a breakthrough for this kind of errors.6 ConclusionThis paper describes and evaluates the ?Gen-dercheck Editor?
a tool to check German ad-ministrative and legal texts for gender equal for-mulations.
The tool is based on the ControlledLanguage Authoring Technology (CLAT), asoftware package to control and check technicaldocuments for orthographical, grammatical andstyptic correctness.
A part of the Style compo-nent has been modified and adapted to the re-quirements of linguistic gender main-streaming.The paper outlines a shallow technique to dis-cover gender-imbalance and evaluates the tech-nique with two texts.
Values for precision andrecall of more than 90% and 85% respectivelyare reported.ReferencesMichael Carl and Antje Schmidt-Wigger.1998.
