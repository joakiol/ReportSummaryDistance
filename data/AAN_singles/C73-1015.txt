A. S. LIBERMANTOWARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHMThe ultimate goal of phonology is to uncover the mechanismwhereby an indiscrete succession of sounds becomes a discrete chainof identifiable phonemes.
A word falls naturally into morphemes andsyllables.
In the course of this double division two classes of languagesemerge: those in which syllable- and morpheme-boundaries alwayscoincide and those in which this correspondence is not obligatory.In the first case the minimal unit of segmentation is the syllable.
In thesecond case we meet with such examples as domus in Latin, readingi n English, and so on.
Syllabically they are do-mus, rea-ding, morpho-logically dora-us, read-ing; the combined scheme is do-m-us, rea-d-ing.At the initial stage of processing the sound chain we are only able todiscriminate between syllabic and phonemic languages, for /In/ indomus and/d/ in reading are phonemes, i.e.
the smallest units of naturalsegmentation i non-syllabic languages.
This is the most primitiveand heuristically the earliest definition of a phoneme that a linguistcan give.
We will formulate the first instructions to the phonologistthus:(I) Take any bimorphemic word (with a sufftx or ending), di-vide it into syllables and by examining the points of morpheme- andsyllable-division state the presence (resp.
absence) of phonemes in thelanguag e ..In this paper we shall concern ourselves with phonemic languages.The mainspring of further analysis is neutralization and relatedphenomena.
Let us take the Russian form \[goT\].
This form is ambi-guous and resolves itself into two different roots: god- "year"  andgot- " Goth ".
The fact that \[goT\] is the phonetic integument of onlytwo forms proves that the distinction between god- and got- lies in onesegment; if they had two different segments, the form under consi-deration would halve resolved itself into at least four roots (n differencesgive 2 -~ or sometimes 2~+ 1 forms): cp.
the invented place-name\[s'tki\] (\[-\] designates a reduced pretonic vowel), which may equally196 ^.
s. LIBERMANwell represent Sodki, Sadki, Sotki, and Satki and thereby demonstratesthat sad- and sot- have two points of distinction.
Having found outthat god- and got- constitute a minimal pair, we must localize the dif-ference between them.The forms of the Genitive case of the two words are g6da and g6ta:syllabically go-da, go-ta, morphologically god-a, got-a.
We cannot knowhow many phonemes there are in the syllable go-; neither do we knowwhether the case inflexion is monophonemic.
But we may be surethat the stem-final elements of goda, gota are monophonemic (go-d-a,go-t-a as do-m-us, rea-d-ing).
We have not learnt o compare phonemes,but we can compare go- of go-da, and go- of go-ta.
The existence ofthe syllables go-1 and go-z proves that they are able to function as in-dependent words: otherwise their separation from the second sylla-bles would have been impossible (cp.
the English latter - ladder).
Butif they are words (actual or virtual: as a matter of fact ~go/does notexist in Russian but/no/,/po\], /to/, /do/,  etc.exist), we can test theiridentity.
If they prove to be homonyms, the difference between godaand gota is concentrated in \ ]d/-  \]t/; if they are non-homonyms, thedifference lies to the left o f /d / -  It/, viz.
in the vowels.1 Go-1 (fromgo-da) and go-2 (from go-ta) are homonyms, and it follows that/d\]and /t/ are indeed different phonemes.
The difference between themthus stated is the most abstract manifestation of a distinctive feature.So far it has nothing to do with phonetics; it is "a  something" whichkeeps/d/and/t \ [  apart.We have detected ifferent phonemes in go-d-a, go-t-a, but wedo not yet know the status of the stem-final consonant in \[goT\].
Achain of simple arguments will convince us that this element is nota phoneme of the same rank as /d/or It/.
Following the row goda,godu, godom, (o) gode (different oblique cases of god-o), we observethat the root is everywhere quite unambiguous.
Only in the Nomi-native case we suddenly acquire a new meaning: \[goT\] is both god-Oand got-O.
A new meaning could not have sprung up, if one and thesame phoneme went on alternating; consequently, the stem-final pho-nemes of goda-godu-godom-gode and god-O cannot be identical.
On theother hand, the root of gota-gotu-gotom-gote is again unambiguous,1 Not in the prevocalic part.
for the opposition got- kot ~ he - cat J could not'havepossibly been neutralized: all events in Russian inflexion happen at the end of the word.Also note the importance of the open syllable ingo-da, go-ta: in a dosed syllable we couldsuspect that the difference is covered by the first post-vocalic onsonants,TOWARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM 197and only in got-O we meet with an unexpected new meaning (notonly got-O but also god-o).
So here too the stem-final consonant ofgota-gotu, etc.
is not the same as that ofgot-O.
The conclusion is ineluc-table that IT\] in \[goT\] does not belong either to /d /or / t / .
It is func-tionally a very weak element, and whatever its physical properties, itis unable to differentiate the morphemes which are distinct in all othersituations.
In \[goT\] both /d /and/ t /must  have lost the feature whichotherwise prevents them from merging, and only the non-distinctivepart must have remained.The phenomenon analyzed above is alone worthy to be calledneutralization.
To make sure of it let us esamine the root ro;f-.
Thisis also an ambiguous root, for we have rog-O "horn " - ro:~ek "littlehorns" (Gen., P1.)
and ro~.-a "mug"  (or simply ro~'-O "rye ").
Acomparison o f /~/and/g /w i l l  give us a distinctive feature just as thecomparison o f /d /and/ t / in  god-O, got-O.
But the ambiguity is presentin all the cases of the word rosa (ro:~a, ro~i, ro:~e, ro~ei, etc.
):/~/doesnot crop up as a result of phonological weakening and is thereforea separate phoneme, as /g/.
Graphically we may represent the twosituations in the following way:/a/ /t/( a phoneme) (a phoneme)odagodugodom(o) gode/T/(an archiphoneme)/g /(a phoneme) (a phoneme)gota togagotu rogugotom rogom(o) gote (o) rogerosaro;~i() " 0 l 'ozero;~ekOur next instructions to the phonologist will be such:(II) Examine all the monosyllabic roots of the language.
Selectthose which are phonetically ambiguous and can be understood asthe roots of two different words.
Take these words and change theminto dissyllabics.
Find the point of syllable division in both and ascer-tain whether the first syllables in them are open.
Only words withinitial open syllables will easily lend themselves to preliminary analysis.Compare the left-hand open syllables: if they may be represented asdifferent words, the roots under consideration have different vowels;198 ^.
s. UB~a~A~if the open syllables may be represented ashomonyms, the differencelies in the postvocalic onsonants.
The opposition of the contrastingphonemes will yield the linguistic basis of the distinctive feature thatkeeps them apart.
Study all the possible oppositions and get al thedistinctive features obtainable by this method.
The features will beonly loosely characterized, e.g.
"that which distinguishes the root-final consonant of such-and-such words and disappears before a pause "The element of the ambiguous form is not an independent phonemeif its occurrence is confined to this form.
But if some root is ambiguousin all its forms and another oot only in one form, we have a case oftwo independent phonemes crossing at a single point, so that the pho-nological make-up of the constantly ambiguous root remains unchanged.When all the distinctive features have been extracted in this way,some phonemes will have become uniquely characterized asbundlesof distinctive f atures.
(It is important that at this stage a phoneme canbe defined both as a minimal unit of natural segmentation a d as abundle of distinctive features, i.e.
not only syntagmatically but alsoparadigmatically).
But even these phonemes will be tied to the stem-final position.
We must now learn to recognize these phonemes inother contexts, e.g.
to identify/d/ in gocla and/d/ in dom "house"as one and the same unit.
This is the most difficult step, and nothingbut a tentative solution can be proposed here.
It seems that phonemesare discovered as purely linguistic entities but identified phonetically.After we have obtained the features of the type "that which distinguish-es etc. "
(see above) we must fred their physical correlates and usethem as tools of further identification.
Human langmage consists ofsounds, and it could be expected that at some late moment the mate-rial implementation f phonemes would come in.Our next instructions coristitute a programme, which has alreadytaken decades to carry out and whose termination lies in a compara-tively distant future.
(III) Select the phonemes uniquely characterized as bundles ofdistinctive features and find their physical correlates.
Use the corre-lates as marks whereby to recognize the phonemes in all contexts.The Russian phonemes/d t g 2 / and some others are uniquely cha-racterized by their distinctive f atures.
But there are phonemes enteringinto few or no alternations.
Thus, Ib I and Iv/never alternate in l~us-sian,'~and sothe specific feature that keeps them apart defies detection.To be sure, while studying \[d t g 21 etc., we got a list of distinctiveTOWARDS A PHONOLOGICAL ALGORITHM 199features and later found their correlates.
Therefore we can now choosesome features from the general ist and ascribe them to /b /and/v /(e.g./b/will be a stop and/v /a  spirant), but the arbitrariness of thisprocedure is apparent.Every system of phonemes, if diagrammed, will consist of concen-tric circles.
The nucleus contains phonemes o active that their beha-viour is able to characterize them uniquely.
Some phonemes are lessactive (e.g.
/b/and/v\[  in Russian), others are (almost) non-characte-rizable at all (e.g./1 m n r/); in the outermost circle we shall find theEnglish/h/and kindred phonemes: these do not enter into any alter-nations and cannot be described by distinctive features.
Phonemes mayform a system or a list.
Only the nucleus, definable through relevantfeatures, deserves the name of system.
Peripheral phonemes are juxta-posed as letters in an alphabet; they are also kept apart but their cor-relates must have an especially wide range of realizations.Our next procedure resembles the previous one:(IV) Select he phonemes whose characteristics only pardy emergefrom the alternations and those which are non-definable through theirlinguistic behaviour.
Contrary to the nuclear phonemes, these mustbe studied as wholes, both by the linguist and by the instrumentalist.A phoneme non-analyzable into distinctive features i itselfa materializedfeature.After we have identified the phonemes in all contexts each of themcomes out as the invariant of some class of sounds.
Hence the finaldefinition of a phoneme: it is a minimal unit of natural segmentationin non-syllabic languages, a bundle of distinctive features, and the in-variant of sounds possessing identical features.The implications of the analysis uggested above are too far-rea-ching to be discussed here in detail.
So only the most important ofthem will be enumerated.1) Phonological research presupposes a certain amount of pro-sodic, morphological, and semantic data; we cannot start unless weknow how to divide words into syllables and morphemes and howto distinguish omonymous forms and roots from non-homonymousones.2) To discover phonemes means to find their syntagmaticboundaries and to arrange them into a system.
No paradigmatic pro-cedures or procedures of identification are possible until the phonemesare separated from their neighbours.200 A.s. I~IB~RMAIq3) Preliminary segmentation a d identification concerns tem-finalconsonants.
Later they are used as "yardsticks " to define and identifystem-initial consonants.
Thus, the syntagmatic procedure comes first;then follows the paradigmatic dentification of phonemes at the endof the stem, and only after that the whole string falls into discrete le-ments.
Until the last step is made, phonology is divorced from pho-netics (except what concerns syllable-division) and is a shadow ofmorphology.4) Phonemes form either systems or lists, according as the lan-guage is rich or poor in inftexion.5) A phonological lgorithm starts with the function and endsup with realizations.
It rejects the idea that phonology is functionalphonetics and operates on the assumption that phonetics i instrumentalphonology.It is our hope that the procedures discussed in this paper can, inprinciple, serve the basis of an algorithm by which a chain of phonemesis generated from an indiscrete sound string.
Once this algorithmbecomes a reality, its programming will be almost a technical problem;we shall be able to construct an analogue of the actual speech mecha-nism and approach coveted goal, viz.
automatic treatment of phonicsubstance.
