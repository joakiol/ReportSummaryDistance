Part I startswith a brief introduction to different bases for dis-course structuring, properties of discourse struc-ture that are relevant to LT, and accessible evi-dence for discourse structure.For discourse structure to be useful for lan-guage technologies, one must be able to automati-cally recognize or generate with it.
Hence, Part IIsurveys computational approaches to recognizingand generating discourse structure, both manually-authored approaches and ones developed throughMachine Learning.Part III of the tutorial describes applicationsof discourse structure recognition and generationin LT, as well as discourse-related resources be-ing made available in English, German, Turkish,Hindi, Czech, Arabic and Chinese.
Part IV con-cludes with a list of future possibilities.3 Tutorial Outline1.
