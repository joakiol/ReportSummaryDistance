The data presentedhere is extracted from the World Atlas ofLanguage Structures (WALS) (Dryer andHaspelmath, 2011).
After pruning due tolow coverage of WALS, we filter the typo-logical data by geographical proximity inorder to ascertain areal typological effects.The data are displayed in heat maps whichreflect the strength of similarity betweenlanguages for different linguistic features.Finally, the heat maps are annotated for lan-guage family membership.
The images soproduced allow a multi-faceted perspectiveon the data which we hope will facilitate theinterpretation of results and perhaps illumi-nate new areas of research in linguistic ty-pology.1 IntroductionThis paper presents a novel way of visualising re-lationships between languages.
Relationships be-tween languages can be understood with respectto linguistic features of the languages, their geo-graphical proximity, and their status with respectto historical development.
The visualisations pre-sented in this paper are part of a new attempt tobring together these three perspectives into a sin-gle image.
One line of recent work brings com-putational methods to bear on the formation anduse of large typological databases, often using so-phisticated statistical techniques to discover rela-tions between languages (Cysouw, 2011; Daume?III and Campbell, 2007; Daume?
III, 2009, amongothers), and another line of work uses typolog-ical data in natural language processing (Georgiet al, 2010; Lewis and Xia, 2008, for example).The task of visually presenting the resulting datain this way has been only infrequently addressed.We are aware of some similar work (Mayer et al,2010; Rohrdantz et al, 2010) in visualising dif-ferences in linguistic typology, phylogeny (Mul-titree, 2009), and geographical variation (Wiel-ing et al, 2011).
Here, we present our methodfor addressing the visualisation gap, bringing to-gether phylogeny, typology, and geography by us-ing data from the World Atlas of Language Struc-tures (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011) to developheat maps that can visually show the intercon-nected relationships between languages and lan-guage families.The main envisioned application of our visual-isations is in the area of linguistic typology.
Ty-pology has been used to derive implications aboutpossible languages, and about the ordering of thehuman mind.
Different theorists have taken dif-ferent views on the relationship between typologyand the universality of languages.
For example,Greenberg (1963), a foundational work, identifieda number of cross-linguistic typological proper-ties and implications and aimed to present themas truly universal ?
relevant for all languages.
In asimilar vein, typological universals have been em-ployed as evidence in a generative story regardinglanguage learning (Chomsky, 2000).Taking a different perspective, Dunn et al(2011) argued that a language?s typology reliesupon the previous generations?
language morethan on any biological, environmental or cogni-tive constraints, and that there are pathways which30are generally followed in language change basedon the previous parent language.
What these argu-ments have in common is a reliance on a view oflinguistic typology that is potentially restricted inits scope, due to insufficient access to broad-scaleempirical data, covering many features of manylanguages of the world.The most comprehensive computational re-source for linguistic typology currently avail-able is the World Atlas of Language Structures(WALS).1 WALS is a large database of detailsof structural properties of several thousand lan-guages (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011).
The prop-erties were collected from descriptive sources bythe project?s 55 authors.However, of the 2,678 languages and 192 fea-tures in WALS, only 16% of the possible datapoints are actually specified?the data are sparse,and the sparsity of the data naturally makes it dif-ficult to perform reliable statistical analysis.
Oneway to work around this limitation is to seekmeaningful visualisations of the data in WALS,instead of simply relying on raw numbers.
This isour approach.In this paper, we first discuss in more detailthe source data and the types of information ex-tracted, followed by a discussion of some diffi-culties presented by the available data and ourapproaches for addressing those difficulties.
Fi-nally, we present a sample of the resulting visual-isations.2 Aspects of the VisualisationsThe visualisations described here bring togetherthree types of information: linguistic features, ge-ographical distance, and phylogenetic distance.For the current study, all three types of informa-tion are extracted from the WALS database.
Infuture work, we would explore alternate sourcessuch as Ethnologue (Lewis, 2009) or MultiTree(2009) for alternate phylogenetic hierarchies.2.1 Linguistic featuresAt the time of writing, WALS contains infor-mation for 2,678 languages.
The linguistic fea-tures covered in WALS range from phonetic andphonological features, over some lexical and mor-phological features, to syntactic structures, word1As of 2008, WALS is browsable online (http://www.wals.info).order tendencies, and other structural phenomena.A total of 192 features are represented, groupedin 144 different chapters, with each chapter ad-dressing a set of related features.
Ignoring the factthat a language having certain features will can-cel out the possibility (or diminish the probabil-ity) of others, only 15.8% of WALS is describedfully.
In other words, if we consider WALS to bea 2,678x192 grid, fewer than 16% of the grid?ssquares contain feature values.The coverage of features/chapters varies dra-matically across languages, with an average of 28feature values per language.
The most populatedfeature has data for 1,519 languages.
Because ofthe extreme sparsity of the data, we restricted ourtreatment to only languages with values for 30%or more of the available features?372 languages,with a total of 36k feature values.2.2 Phylogenetic distanceLanguages are related phylogenetically either ver-tically, by lineage, or horizontally, by contact.In WALS, each language is placed in a tree hi-erarchy that specifies phylogenetic relations.
Inthe WALS data files, this is specified by linkingat three different levels: family, such as ?Sino-Tibetan?, sub-family, such as ?Tibeto-Burman?,and genus, such as ?Northern Naga?.
The WALSphylogenetic hierarchies do not take into accountlanguage contact.
For that, we used geographiccoordinates, which are present in WALS, as aproxy for contact.2.3 Geographic distanceGeographic distance is an important aspect of ty-pological study because neighbouring languagesoften come to share linguistic features, even inthe absence of genetic relationship between thelanguages.
Each language in WALS is associ-ated with a geographical coordinate representinga central point for the main population of speakersof that language.
We use these data to determinegeographic distance between any two languages,using the haversine formula for orthodromic dis-tance.2 A crucial aspect of our visualisationsis that we produce them only for sets of lan-guages within a reasonable geographic proximity2This measure is inexact, especially over long distances,due to the imperfect topography and non-spherical shape ofthe earth, but it is computationally simple and is accurateenough for our present purposes.31and with sufficient feature coverage in WALS.For this study, we used two approaches toclustering languages according to geographic dis-tance.
First, we chose an arbitrary radius in or-der to create a decision boundary for clusteringneighbouring languages.
For each language, thatlanguage?s location is fixed as the centroid of thecluster and every language within the given radiusis examined.
We found that a radius of 500 kilo-metres provides a sufficient number of exampleseven after cleaning low-coverage languages fromthe WALS data.The second approach selected an arbitrarylower bound for the number of languages in thegeographic area under consideration.
If a suffi-cient percentage (enough to graph) of the totalnumber of languages in the area remained aftercleaning the WALS data, we took this as a usefularea and did mapping for that area.
This num-ber is clearly under-representative of the amountof contact languages, as only half of the world?slanguages are present in WALS with any degreeof coverage.
This proxy was not as good as theradius method at choosing specific, useful exam-ples for the n-nearest neighbours, as the languageschosen were often quite distant from one another.3 Heat Map VisualisationsWe focused on producing visualisations only forfeatures that are salient for the maximal numberof selected languages.
We choose two heat mapsfor display here, from the least sparse data avail-able, to demonstrate the output of the visualisa-tion method.
The remaining visualisations, alongwith all code used to produce the visualisations,are available in a public repository.3All data was downloaded freely from WALS,all coding was done in either Python or R. Thecode was not computationally expensive to run,and the programming languages and methods arequite accessible.In a two-dimensional heat map, each cell ofa matrix is filled with a colour representing thatcell?s value.
In our case, the colour of the cell rep-resents the normalised value of a linguistic featureaccording to WALS.
Languages with the samecolour in a given row have the same value for3https://github.com/RichardLitt/visualizing-languageHamtai UnaImondaWaskiaAmeleAwtuw UsanKobonYimasAlamblakArapesh (Mountain)KewaTauya HuaYagaria DumoSentaniOrder of Object and VerbOrder of Negative Morpheme and VerbPreverbal Negative MorphemesPostverbal Negative MorphemesPosition of Negative Word With Respect to S, O, & VNegative MorphemesOrder of Genitive and NounPosition of Tense?Aspect AffixesOrder of Adposition and Noun PhraseOrder of Adjective and NounO & V Ordering and the Adj & N OrderingGender Distinctions in Independent Personal PronounsPerson Marking on AdpositionsO & V Ordering and the Adposition & NP OrderingAlignment of Verbal Person MarkingFigure 1: Geographically-focused heat map; see textfor details.

Once the set of lan-guages was determined, we selected for graph-ing only the most commonly-occurring featuresacross that set of languages.To present the visualisation, we first centredthe source language in the map.
This decisionwas made in order to reduce the effect of one ofthe primary issues with using distance on a twodimensional graph; distance between two non-source languages is not shown, meaning that onecould be to the north and another to the south.This means that the languages on the extremes ofthe map may be far apart from each other, andshould be viewed with caution.Figure 1 shows a geographically-focused heatmap with values for various morphological andword order features.
The map is centred on Yi-mas, a language spoken in New Guinea.
Thefeatures presented represent a particularly non-4Due to this reliance on colour, we strongly suggest view-ing the heat maps presented here in colour.32sparse section of WALS for this language area.A number of insights can be gleaned here.
Mostprominently, these languages are quite homoge-nous with respect to the selected features.
Giventhat most of the languages do indeed belong to thesame language family (cf.
top bar of the graph),this is unlikely to be a chance effect.
In the 5throw (?O&V Ordering and the Adj&N Ordering?
),we see via the cluster of red cells a partial group-ing of languages close to Yimas, with less sim-ilarity at a greater distance.
The nearly alter-nating pattern we see for ?Position of NegativeWord With Respect to S,O,&V?
may suggest arealgroups that have been split by the data-centringfunction.
Also, the checkerboard pattern for thisfeature and the one below (?Postverbal NegativeMorphemes?)
suggests a possible negative corre-lation between these two linguistic features.3.2 Phylogenetically-focused heat mapsTo produce phylogenetically-focused visualisa-tions, for each language we identified other lan-guages coming from the same family, subfam-ily, or genus.
Figure 2 shows a phylogenetically-focused heat map for Niger-Congo languages, ar-ranged from west to east.
A number of the west-ern languages show red cells for features relatedto relative clauses; these can be compared tomostly blue cells in the eastern languages.
Wealso see some apparent groupings for variableword order in negative clauses (red cells in west-ern languages) and for NegSVO Order (purplecells in western languages).
For some pairs ofadjacent languages (most notably Bambara andSupyire), we see clusters of shared features.
Es-pecially give the importance of Bambara for syn-tactic argumentation (Culy, 1985), this graph is anexcellent example of visualisation pointing out anintriguing area for closer analysis.4 ConclusionIn this paper we present a new approach to visual-ising relationships between languages, one whichallows for the simultaneous viewing of linguisticfeatures together with phylogenetic relationshipsand geographical location and proximity.
Thesevisualisations allow us to view language relation-ships in a multi-faceted way, seeking to workaround the sparseness of available data and facili-tate new insights into linguistic typology.In this work we placed strong restrictions onDiola?FognyWolofTemne Kisi GreboBambara Supyire AkanKoromfeDagbaniEwe YorubaIjo (Kolokuma)Gwari Igbo BiromFyemBabungoFula(Nigerian)MumuyeEwondoDoyayo KongoGbeya BossangoaSangoLuvaleNkore?Kiga Zulu SwahiliOrder of Numeral and NounPostnominal relative clausesDouble?headed relative clausesReciprocal ConstructionsCorrelative relative clausesPosition of Polar Question ParticlesOrder of Person Markers on the VerbDifferent word order in negative clausesOptional Double Negation in SVO languagesNegSVO OrderSNegVO OrderSVNegO OrderAdjoined relative clausesOrder of Degree Word and AdjectiveComparative ConstructionsFigure 2: Phylogenetic heat-map of Niger-Congo lan-guages, arranged from west to east.both feature coverage and selection of salient fea-tures for representation, reducing the number ofgraphs produced to 6 with geographic focus and8 with phylogenetic focus.
One topic for futurework is to explore other ways of working withand expanding the available data in order to ac-cess even more useful visualisations.
In addition,it would be very interesting to apply this visuali-sation method to data from other sources, for ex-ample, data from multiple related dialects.
In suchcases, coverage is likely to be better, and the lan-guages in question will have been selected alreadyfor their relatedness, thus avoiding some of thedata-filtering issues that arise.
Finally, we wouldlike to investigate more principled approaches toselection, presentation, and ordering of linguisticfeatures in the heat maps.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the three anonymous reviewersfor helpful comments on the current paper as wellas interesting suggestions for future work.ReferencesNoam Chomsky.
