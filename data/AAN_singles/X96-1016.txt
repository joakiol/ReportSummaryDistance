BACKGROUNDShrinking budgets, reduction in personnel and in-creasing performance expectations are facts of today'sGovernment environment.
The intelligence communityhas seen these trends tress its ability to collect, manageand disseminate information in an efficient, timelymanner.
The need to respond to rapidly changing state-ments of operational interest only exacerbates the prob-lem.
It is no longer sufficient o monitor certain pre-de-fined individuals or interests.
A proactive collection andindexing service must store virtually all types of in-formation to be prepared for any eventuality.The Advanced Data Extraction and Preparationvia Tipster (ADEPT) Program \[Contract Number95-F147400-000\] is a TIPSTER II demonstration proj-ect aimed at alleviating problems currently being facedby the Office of Information Resources (OIR).
OIR hasbeen chartered to implement enterprise-wide systemsto collect, archive, distribute, and manage informationobtained from unclassified ata sources typically called"Open Sources.
"In support of its charter, OIR implemented ROSE,which provides afull range of information managementtools that support document input, tagging, archiving,retrieval, and dissemination.
The ROSE system is han-dling an increasing volume of data from disparatesources having widely varying formats.
Acquisition ofnew sources or accommodation f format changes inexisting sources can have considerable cost and effortimpact on OIR operations, ince existing software andprocedures often require modification.
ADEPT will ad-dress the potentially high costs and delays incurredwhen adapting the current ROSE data preparation mod-ule to handle format changes and variations in new orexisting sources in an automatic and systematic fashionimproving the responsiveness and offering flexibility toOIR's user community.2.
CAPABILITIESADEPT was conceived as a vehicle for capabili-ties to alleviate problems currently being faced by OIR.ADEPT tags documents in a uniform fashion, usingStandard Generalized Markup (SGML) according toOIR standards.
ADEPT provides a friendly user inter-face enabling Data Administrators to easily extend thesystem to tag new document formats and resolve prob-lems with existing document formats.Data Processing and Extraction: ADEPT pro-cesses both well-formed and ill-formed ata; acceptingraw documents and parsing them to identify source-de-pendent fields that delineate specific important in-formation.
Some of these strings will be normalized.The field names, field values, and their normalizedforms are stored as annotations along with the documentin a TIPSTER compliant document manager.
AnSGML tag, defined by OIR, is associated with each an-notation.
The SGML tags delineate predefined ocu-ment segments, such as title, publication date, mainbody text, etc.
If ADEPT correctly captures all thefields for a documents format, an SGML-encoded oc-ument is transmitted to the ROSE System for informa-tion dissemination.Problem Detection and Diagnosis: ADEPT recog-nizes problems in the input documents and, offers deepdiagnostics and suggestions to the Data Administratorfor fixing those problems.
Although new sources, for-mat changes and erroneous or ill-behaved data cancause processing errors, ADEPT identifies these prob-lem occurrences, generating diagnostics that describethe nature of the problem, such as where it occurred andwhy it did not match.
From the diagnostics, the DataAdministrator can easily determine whether the prob-lem is due to an error (anomaly) in the data or a changein format.Error Handling and Document Viewing: ADEPTmaintains a problem queue and provides GUI windowsto aid the Data Administrator with both evaluating thesource of problems (data error or new/changed format)61and resolving them.
The GUI enables aData Adminis-trator to see the original document, he output SGMLtemplate and the fields from which the SGML tags weregenerated.
A Data Administrator can manually changethe value of a tag and resubmit resolved ocument(s) forreprocessing by the system.System Adaptation: ADEPT enables Data Admin-istrators to manually adapt the system's configuration(mapping templates) to meet new or changed formats.Through a combination of menus, customized panelsand, cutting and pasting operations, the Data Adminis-trator can specify the instructions to be used by ADEPTto parse and extract data from incoming documents.3.
SYSTEM ARCHITECTUREFigure 3-1 illustrates how ADEPT will be insertedinto the Rich Open Source Environment Version 2(ROSE) testbed environment at OIR.
After a success-fully evaluation, ADEPT may be made operational.ADEPT will be connected to the ROSE-Feedservers via a 16MB/second Token-Ring Local AreaADEPT User WorkstationsIIROSE =1CatcherIIOne-Wav Fiber/Modem i mSystem MonitorADEPT ServerFile TransferOSI2 ROSEFeedsFigure 3-1.
ADEPT System ArchitectureNetwork (LAN).
These servers receive streams of docu-ments from currently five sources/providers: NEXIS,DIALOG, DataTimes, FBIS and Newswire.
Refer toAppendix A for a sample document example.
After suc-cessfully parsing and extracting document required in-formation, ADEPT will transmit aSGML Tagged ocu-ment over a one-way fiber to the ROSE-Catcher wherethe information will be archived and disseminated to theOIR user community.
Refer to Appendix B for a pro-cessed ocument example.ADEPT will have the ability process more thanone thousand separate sources from the five current OIRproviders, at an average of 80 megabytes and a maxi-mum of 150 megabytes per day currently.
These figuresare estimated to increase by twelve percent per month.Over an average month, ADEPT will operate seven daysper week processing and expected 600,000 documents.Appendix C depicts the SGML tags which will beidentified by ADEPT.4.
SYSTEM DES IGNFigure 4-1 illustrates the design of ADEPT.ADEPT is comprised of eight processes; each perform-ing a specialized task.
These processes are: the Docu-ment Input (DI), the Document Processor (DP), theDocument Management (DM), the Management In-formation System Manager (MISM), the ProblemQueue Manager (PQM), the System Adaptation Manag-er (SAM), the Administration Manager (AM), and theOutput Manager Function (OM).4.1.
Document Input (DI)The DI process is the interface between ADEPTand the ROSE-Feed servers.
Based on the source, amapping template is selected.
The DI identifies and62!
'Figure 4-1.
ADEPT Document Parserseparates the ROSE Feed stream into documents.
Thedocument and its relevant information is stored in localstorage via the DM function calls.If the mapping template can not be identified, thestream probably came from a source unknown toADEPT.
Unknown sources are sent to the ProblemQueue to for user intervention.4.2,  Document Processor (DP)The DP identifies and extracts all SGML tags de-fined in the mapping template for the specific source.Each identified field value is validated and normalized(if required) before being stored as annotations with thedocument via DM function calls.
DP creates annota-tions with the value 'NA' (Not Available) for those non-required SGML tags not present in the document.If while processing, DP is unable to identify a re-quired SGML tag, validate or normalize its contents, thedocument is identified as a problem document.
DP doesnot stop processing the document once encountering anerror.
It completes the document processing; identify-ing any remaining errors.
For each problem SGML tag,DP generates diagnostic information.
The diagnosticinformation contains an error explanation as well assuggested corrective actions.
Problem documents aresent to the Problem Queue to await analysis.4.3.
Document Manager (DM)The DM, the heart of ADEPT, is composed of a setof library routines providing a standard interface be-tween ADEPT and the collections of documents in per-sistent storage.
The DM is TIPSTER compliant and uti-lizes Open Database Connective (ODBC) to storedocument and document relevant information in the Sy-base System 11 database.
ODBC adds an additional lay-er of flexibility to DM.
With ODBC, the Sybase System11 database can be substituted with any ODBC com-pliant database on any platform.4.4.
Management Information systemsManager (M ISM)The MISM process manages the quantitative MISStatistical data used to monitor and evaluate ADEPT.MISM records the document's name, source, date/timestamp, and other relevant information when a:?
Document is received by ADEPT,?
Document is successfully tagged,?
Problem document is identified, and63?
Document is transmitted toMain-ROSE Catcher.Additionally, ADEPT captures similar statistics onproblem types and problems associated with each docu-ment.
The ROSE Data Administrator can perform sim-ple queries and execute quick reports against he col-lected data.4.5.
Problem Queue Manager (PQM)The PQM is responsible for managing the problemqueue of ADEPT.
The problem queue is a visual repre-sentation of all problem document information con-tained in the database.
An entry exists for each problemdocument; it contains the document identifier, source,problem class, status, mapping template identifier, date/time stamp, etc.At the ROSE Data Administrator's discretion,documents in the problem queue can be sorted and lim-ited by either source, date/time stamp, problem class,mapping template and status.To investigate/resolve a problem document, thedesired ocument must be selected.
For each documentselected, the document viewer GUI is invoked.
TheGUI displays: 1) the original document, 2) the currentversion of the SGML template for that document, 3) thelinkages between the two, 4) diagnostic informationassociated with the document, and 5) suggestions forfixing the problem tag(s).The document viewer allows one to modify prob-lem tags based on system supplied corrective actions.
Ifsystem suggestions are rejected, tag values can be gen-erated from user supplied data.
For cases where theoriginal document trigger is garbled due to a transmis-sion error, the user can elect to define a temporary trig-ger.
Notes can created and saved for each document.After the problems associated with a document areaddressed, the document can be resubmitted to the sys-tem for reprocessing.
PQM functions provide the userthe ability to select and resubmit multiple documents.4.6.
System Adaptation Manager (SAM)The SAM process provides the capability tocreate, modify, and associate mapping templates with aspecific data source.
A mapping template contains thedirections on how to parse a specific data source.
Itspecifies the SGML tags (i.e., Pubdate), whether the tagis required and any associated field names (triggerswithin a document) which must be used to extract heSGML tag value as well as corresponding format valida-tion and normalization rules.
There is one primary map-ping template for each data source received by ADEPT.Once created, SAM allows the Data Administratorto test their mapping template changes against samplefiles of documents.4.7.
Administrator Manager (AM)The AM manages the routine system administra-tion of ADEPT.
AM provides login control and user per-missions, maintains the system's security and audit log,and enables backups/restores of the system databases.All user interaction (system adaptations and prob-lem queue manipulation) performed by the user are re-corded in the AM's audit log including a record of thechange, user identification, and date/time stamp.
Boththe security and audit logs can be viewed via the AMGUI.From the AM GUI, the user can authorize others toprint, display, search, consolidate, and delete the com-puter security audit log as well as add, delete or re-en-able accounts by changing user permissions.4.8.
Output Manager (OM)The OM manages the output of successfullytagged ocuments for ADEPT.
The OM's main capabil-ities include:?
Creation of the SGML tagged version of the docu-ment,?
Performing "Special Processing" (when required),?
Providing an interface for passing the tagged ocu-ment o the Main-ROSE Catcher,?
Providing a GUI which will allow the ROSE DataAdministrator to view the original document, hefinal tagged ocument and the linkages between thetwo for any document stored in local storage.OM retrieves uccessfully processed ocuments.For each document, OM walks through the annotations(SGML tags) accessing their associated SGML tag val-ue.
The set of SGML tags with their corresponding val-ue constitute the SGML template for that document.If the document is initially from the ROSE-Feed,OM will send the SGML Template, conforming specificprotocol, to the Main-ROSE Catcher.
Successfully pro-cessed sample documents are saved to a UNIX file forfuture review.5.
SYSTEM PROCESSINGInformation is passed to each process via collec-tions stored within the TIPSTER compliant DocumentManager (DM).
Collections act as the queues for theprocesses.
A collection contains the information eces-sary for a process to perform (i.e., documents and docu-ment relevant information).
The DP, PQM, and OMprocesses each have a unique collection associated withit.
A process begins by accessing the first document in64its collection.
When completed, the document ismovedto another collection for the next process to continue.Since a document moves from collection to collection,each process only depends upon the documents in itscollection.As depicted in Figure 5- I ,  there are two categoriesof collections: production and adaptation.

-r ,L--ZJSaved to afilesupplied documents are processed in the productioncollections.
Adaptation testing as well as documentsfrom sample files are processed in the adaptation collec-tions.
These two categories of collections will clearlyseparate adaptation documents from production docu-ments.
Documents in the production category will runat a higher priority than those in the adaptation category.Prioritizing enables ADEPT to process both categoriesof collections concurrently.6.
STATUSThe ADEPT project has completed the System Re-quirements Review (SRR) as well as the PreliminaryDesign Review (PDR).
A Critical Design Review(CDR) is scheduled for late June 1996; to be followed bya TIPSTER Engineering Review.
ADEPT will beinstalled in OIR's testbed environment in December1996 where it will undergo athree month evaluation pe-riod.
After a successful evaluation, OIR will have theoption to transition ADEPT to their production environ-ment.65APPENDIX A: SAMPLE RAW DOCUMENTACCESS # FINP2407547HEADLINE Bre-X discloses new drill resultsColumn: COMPANY NEWSESTIMATED INFORMATION UNITS: 1.7DATE 04/06/96SOURCE * The Financial Post (FINP)Edition: WeeklySection: 1, NewsPage: 23Category: NEWS(Copyright The Financial Post)RE NME CNBre-X discloses new drill resultsWords: 124Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd., discoverer of a potentiallyhuge gold property in Indonesia, disclosed new drill results lateThursday.ADDED KEYWORDS: GOLD; MINERAL EXPLORATION; INDONESIACORPORATE NAME: Bre-X Minerals Ltd.
