c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsAnnotating corpus data for a quantitative, constructional analysis ofmotion verbs in Modern Standard ArabicDana AbdulrahimUniversity of Bahraindarahim@uob.edu.bhAbstractThis article proposes an annotation method of corpusdata for the purposes of providing a constructionistaccount of lexical behavior.
The lexical items in ques-tion are seven verbs of motion in Modern StandardArabic that pertain to the events of COME (at?, ??
?a,?a?ara, and qadima) and GO (?ahaba, ma?
?, andr??a).
The tag set selected for the annotation of theCOME and GO data frames consists of morpho-syntactic tags that characterize verb usage as well assemantic tags that aim to highlight the semantic com-ponent of, for instance, adverbial and adpositionalphrases that accompany the verb.
I will brieflydemonstrate the analytical potential of such dataframe by discussing the various kinds of statisticaltests such data frame is designed to undergo, as ameans of better understanding lexical behavior in con-text, and, eventually, arriving at a better understand-ing of lexical and constructional choices made bynative speakers of Arabic, as demonstrated in corpora.1 IntroductionThe core tenets of constructionist theories oflanguage claim that the basic unit of linguisticorganization is a construction.
According toCroft and Cruse (2004:257), a construction ?con-sist[s] of pairings of form and meaning that are atleast partially arbitrary?, where ?meaning?
is re-ferred to as the conventionalized function of aconstruction.
This conventionalization of a con-struction?s meaning/function includes not onlythe literal meaning of an utterance, but also thediscourse situation of that utterance, as well asany pragmatic implication conveyed by that ut-terance (Croft and Cruse, 2004).The concept of a ?construction?
in cognitiveapproaches to grammar, therefore, relates to boththe idiomatic portions of language, where themeaning of an utterance is not predictable fromthe component parts of which it consists (e.g.raining cats and dogs), as well as the co-occurrence of any two (free or bound) mor-phemes  that reflect general morphosyntacticstructures and where the meaning of an utteranceis fully predictable from its component parts (e.g.I need to sleep).
Such view of grammar postu-lates that ?the interaction of syntax and lexicon ismuch wider and deeper than the associations ofcertain verbs with certain complements?
(Bybee,2010:77), and that a considerable part of our lin-guistic knowledge consists of conventionalizedexpressions, or constructions (Langacker, 1987).In light of these constructionist assump-tions, therefore, the behavior of a lexical item isbest understood in its context of use and not inisolation, an idea that stretches back decades (cf.Firth, 1957).
This includes not only lexical collo-cates, but also the entire morphosyntactic framethat hosts a lexical item.
All these elements con-tribute to the composed or conventionalizedmeaning/function expressed by a particular lin-guistic item.
In order to examine lexical behav-ior, therefore, we need to move beyond singlesemantic, morphological, or syntactic propertiesof a lexical item and scrutinize the entire lexico-syntactic frame in which it occurs.
Increasingly,this is done through examination of corpus data.The availability of corpora facilitates and moti-vates such highly contextualized analytical ap-proach, since corpora provide a large amount ofnaturally occurring, contextualized uses (as op-posed to the reliance on introspective and eliciteddata that may not reflect actual language usage atall).
Moreover, corpora provide large amounts oflinguistic data, which allows the researcher toconduct extensive quantitative analyses of thephenomenon in question.In Modern Standard Arabic, the existence ofseveral verbs denoting the motion events COME(at?, ??
?a, ?a?ara, and qadima) and GO (?ahaba,ma?
?, and r?
?a) provides an excellent case studyfor a constructionist, corpus-based examinationof the features that characterize the usage of sup-posedly near-synonymous lexical items.
InAbdulrahim (2013) I have argued that the fourCOME verbs ?
as well as the three GO verbs ?
canbe interchangeably used in contexts where theevent depicts a strictly deictic and physical mo-tion event, as in (1) and (2).28(1)  ???

For instance, The sentence in(1) would not admit all four verbs when the as-pect inflection on the verb is changed.
To illus-trate, in (3), if we hold all constructional featuresconstant and change verb inflection from perfec-tive to jussive, this results in a preference for at?and ?a?ara by native speakers of Arabic over??
?a or qadima.

For these purposes, I have adoptedthe methodological approach outlined in Gries(2006), Gries & Divjak (2009), and Gries &Otani (2010) for a constructionist description ofthe Behavioral Profile of a lexical item.
I havealso employed logistic regression ?
namelypolytomous logistic regression, outlined in detailin Arppe (2008) ?
as a statistical method thatmodels lexical or constructional choices as afunction of a wide range of contextual features.The quantitative approach to lexical analysispresented in this paper involves constructing adata frame for every lexical item under study, inwhich numerous corpus concordance lines areindividually marked-up for an extensive set oflinguistic features (morphological, syntactic, andsemantic).
This includes, for examples, specificelements pertaining to verb morphology, phrasestructure, as well as the different elements thatco-occur with the verb in specific constructions.Such data frame can undergo numerous explora-tory and multi-variate statistical tests as a meansof zeroing in on the kinds of constructions asso-ciated with the verbs in question.2 The corpusIn order to construct the multi-variate dataframe for the analysis of motion verbs in Arabic,I chose ArabiCorpus (arabicorpus.byu.edu) asthe source for data.
ArabiCorpus is a free onlinecorpus developed by Dilworth Parkinson atBrigham Young University.
As of October 2012,the corpus contains around 146,000,000 wordtokens from different written and spoken genres.At the time of data collection (Fall 2010) thecorpus contained around 69,000,000 word to-kens.
Additional MSA as well as pre-moderntexts have been added to the corpus since thebeginning of 2011.
Texts included inArabiCorpus almost exclusively belong to thewritten genre, save for a small sub-corpus ofspoken Egyptian Arabic.
The written genres cov-ered in ArabiCorpus vary from newspaper writ-ing, pre-modern writing, modern literature, tononfiction.
These genres are represented in thecorpus in varying proportions with newspaperwriting accounting for over 90% of the total sizeof the entire corpus.
News articles included inthis sub-section of ArabiCorpus cover issuesfrom 1996 to 2010 and are extracted from peri-odicals published in different parts of the Arabworld (North Africa, Egypt, Arabian Gulf, theLevant, etc.).
For this study, the MSA sub-corpora that were queried for COME and GO usesare related to newspaper, modern literature, andnonfiction writing.
As expected, most examplesreturned from corpus queries were in fact drawnfrom the newspaper genre.ArabiCorpus is not tagged for parts-of-speech (POS) which makes the search for partic-ular grammatical categories a daunting task.Nevertheless, it can be easily queried using regu-lar expressions.
This study targeted very specificinflected forms of the MSA verb: perfective, im-perfective, jussive, subjunctive, and imperative;and excluded participial forms (e.g.
active parti-ciple) and nominal forms (e.g.
verbal nouns).Relying on orthographic regular expressions,therefore, proved to be the most efficient method29for querying these particular forms.
What maycomplicate any search in an Arabic written cor-pus is the lack of short vowels which are indicat-ed by certain diacritics written over or under-neath a letter.
Naturally, it was necessary to filtercorpus returns manually to eliminate any irrele-vant forms that may have been returned in thecorpus search.Despite the time-consuming nature of suchcorpus querying steps, ArabiCorpus proved to bea reliable and rich source for contextualized lan-guage uses.
Add to that the fact that even thoughthe online interface of ArabiCorpus only displays10 words before and after the KWIC (key wordin context), the researcher can still retrieve theentire text hosting that sentence.
Therefore whenthe analysis or the annotation requires going be-yond the 10 word window to examine the entirephrase structure, it is possible to retrieve suchinformation from ArabiCorpus.
Another addedbenefit of using the online interface ofArabiCorpus is the ease of downloading all re-turned hits of a certain lexical item or construc-tion to be viewed in a spreadsheet, which was amajor step in the collection of data for this re-search.3 COME and GO data framesIn Abdulrahim (2013) I proposed a quantita-tive (as well as a qualitative) analysis based onthe construction of a data frame for each one ofthe seven verbs of motion.
Each individual dataframe is typically composed of a large number ofcorpus concordance lines (500 concordancelines) involving the KWIC (i.e.
verb under inves-tigation) in its natural context of use.
Every con-cordance line is thoroughly examined and taggedfor a wide range of morphosyntactic and seman-tic features.
These constructional features includethe syntactic structure that hosts the verb, thepatterns of verbal inflections for every instanceof verb use (e.g.
subject number, person, andgender, as well as other morphosyntactic aspectsof the Arabic verb), the semantic properties ofother components of the construction (e.g.
se-mantic properties of the subject), as well as theinclusion or exclusion of phrases, lexical items,or clitics denoting a starting point of the event(SOURCE), a terminal point of the event (GOAL),etc.Such a heavily annotated dataset has the po-tential of being explored statistically in multipleways via simple frequency count methods aswell as complex multi-variate statistical model-ing.
Such quantitative approach to analyzingcorpus data aims to define the specific character-istics of the constructions associated with thevarious meanings and functions of each MSACOME and GO verb involved in this study.
In thefollowing section I will elaborate on the selectionof these contextual features for the annotation ofCOME and GO data frames.3.1 Selection of contextual features and theannotation of corpus dataThe first step for creating a multi-variate da-ta frame is to generate a list of features or varia-bles which are relevant to the motion eventschemas in questions and which reflect themorphosyntax of Modern Standard Arabic.Along the lines of Gries?s study on the polysemyof the English verb run (2006), Gries andDivjak?s (2006) investigation of Russian verbs ofTRY, as well as Gries and Otani?s (2010) analysisof the synonymy and polysemy of adjectives ofsize in English, I developed a large set of mor-phological, syntactic, and semantic features thatreflect the usage of MSA motion verbs.The variable set includes nominal variables(multiple levels) and binary variables (YES/NOvalues indicating absence or presence of feature).Table 1 shows the different categories of varia-bles subsumed under morphological, syntactic,and semantic variables.
In Appendix A, I provideexamples and illustrations of the different anno-tations of levels within semantic variables takenfrom the actual data frame.

ad-verbs, adverbial uses, and other lexical items).
These addi-tional variables did not form part of the quantitative analysisin Abdulrahim (2013).
Nevertheless, they are  of some in-terest and proved to be useful for a qualitative analysis ofMSA motion verbs.30Syntactic variablesLevelsTRANSITIVITY YES, NOINTERROGATIVE YES, NONEGATIVE YES, NOPREPOSITIONALPHRASEYES, NOLOCATIVE ADVERBPHRASEYES, NOADVERBIAL PHRASE YES, NOSERIAL VERB CON-STRUCTIONYES, NOSemantic variablesLevelsSUBJECT CATEGORY ACTIVITY, ANIMAL, ATTRIB-UTE, BODY, COGNITION, COM-MUNICATION, CONTENT (of adocument/speech), DEMON-STRATIVE, DUMMY SUBJECT,EVENT, GROUP, HUMAN, LOCA-TION, NOTION, OB-JECT/ARTIFACT, SENSE, STATE,SUBSTANCE, TIMEGOAL PHRASE YES, NOSOURCE PHRASE YES, NOMANNER PHRASE YES, NOSETTING PHRASE YES, NOPATH PHRASE YES, NOPURPOSIVE PHRASE YES, NOCOMITATIVE PHRASE YES, NOTEMPORAL PHRASE YES, NODEGREE PHRASE YES, NOTable 1.
A selection of variables GO and COMEcorpus hits were coded for.As mentioned earlier, the primary motiva-tion for this set of 23 linguistic features/tags hasbeen the lexico-syntactic properties of deicticmotion event schemas in MSA.
For instance, adeictic motion event is likely to include a phrasespecifying a GOAL and/or a SOURCE of the mo-tion event.
In addition, it may include  MANNERof motion and the inclusion of a COMITATIVEphrase (i.e.
accompaniment by an ob-ject/individual in the GO or COME event).
Eachverb usage was also coded for the semantic cate-gory of the sentential subject or, conceptuallyspeaking, the moving entity involved in the mo-tion event.
These categories include HUMAN, OB-JECT or ARTIFACT, and also more abstract/non-physical entities such as EVENT, COMMUNICA-TION (e.g.
a statement), COGNITION (e.g.
anidea), etc.
As for the morphosyntactic featuresselected for tagging motion verbs, these reflectthe inflectional properties of the MSA verb(MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECT AND MOOD, NUMBER,PERSON, and GENDER) as well as TENSE and AS-PECT.
The variable labeled TRANSITIVITY, onlypertains to certain uses of COME verbs in MSAwhere COME verbs can appear in transitive con-structions in which the direct object is the GOALof the motion event.Text genre was not considered a variablesince, as I mentioned earlier, the majority of theannotated 3,500 corpus hits belong to the genreof newspaper writing.
Results obtained from ex-amining this data frame should, therefore, beconsidered as mostly reflective of the usage ofCOME and GO verbs in newspaper writing.
Sen-tence (4) is an example of a contextualized verbuse annotated for the features listed above.

2  For in-stance, we can simply run the COME and GO dataframes through mono-variate exploratory testssuch as chi-square tests as a means of zeroing inon the distribution of contextual elements pereach GO and COME verb.
This kind of analysiswould constitute a first step towards identifyingdivergence in usage patterns associated with eachMSA motion verb.
This preliminary step furthermotivates and justifies the examination of inter-action patterns among the contextual features, as2 See Hastie, T., et al (2009), and Agresti (2002) ?
amongothers ?
for comprehensive discussions on statistical teststhat can be applied to multi-variate data frames.31well as the identification of clusters of featuresthat are closely tied to certain verb uses.
A multi-variate analysis eventually facilitates the identifi-cation of prototypical uses of each verb as wellas the less prototypical uses.
In the following Iwill briefly discuss three types of statisticalmethods that can be applied to the MSA COMEand GO data frames: (i) chi-square test; (ii) clus-ter analysis; and (iii) polytomous logistic regres-sion analysis.34.1 Chi-square testsThe primary purpose of subjecting theCOME and GO data frames to chi-square test ofindependence is to examine whether the distribu-tion of the different levels of variables (tags) donot vary as a function of verb (null hypothesis),or, if they actually do vary as a function of verb(alternative hypothesis).
For instance, if we ex-amine the occurrence of a GOAL phrase per eachGO verb, would the distribution of variables bethe same or different across the  three verbs.
Totest this hypothesis ?where we have an inde-pendent variable (verb) and a dependent variable(GOAL) ?we can run a chi-square test on variabledistribution.
Table 2 shows the observed fre-quencies for the occurrence/absence of a GOALphrase per each GO verb, while Table 3 showsthe expected frequencies calculated by the com-mand chisq.test()$expected in R (www.r-project.org).VERBGOAL - YESOBS.

Expected values for the variable GOALby GO verb.3 See Abdulrahim (2013) for further description of the prop-erties and applications of these statistical analyses on theMSA COME and GO data frames.The calculated Pearson?s chi-square test forthe distribution given in Table 4 proved to bequite significant: X2 = 277.1034, df = 6, p-value< 2.2e-16.
This indicates that the distribution thevariable GOAL for each GO verb deviates highlysignificantly from the expected distribution.We can also examine the cell-wise diver-gences from a uniform distribution for this par-ticular contingency table by conducting a stand-ardized Pearson?s residual (discussed in Agresti2002: 81; Arppe, 2008: 83-84).
These test statis-tics can either be retrieved in R by using thecommand chisq.test()$std or by running the func-tion chisq.posthoc(), which is part of  the statisti-cal package {polytomous} developed by AnttiArppe (2012).
Table 4 contains the calculatedvalues, which indicate whether the observed co-occurrence frequency reported in each individualcell is significantly more or less than expected.4The chisq.posthoc()function presents an easierway to interpret these figures, in that it assigns+/?/0 values for each cell, which can be inter-preted as insignificant (0), significantly morethan expected (+), or significantly less than ex-pected (?

Such mono-variatemethods undoubtedly set the stage for the morecomplex multi-variate analyses that will followand to which I turn next.4.2 Cluster analysisClustering methods can help us examine thejoint effect on the overall verbal behavior foreach verb in the GO and COME verb set.
One suchmethod is referred to as hierarchical agglomera-4  Typically, the standardized Pearson?s residual value issignificantly higher than what is expected when it is > 2.0,and significantly lower than expected when the value is < -2.0 (Arppe, 2008).32tive cluster analysis (explained more in detail inGries, 2006; Diviaj and Gries, 2006; Gries andOtani, 2010, among others).
Generally speaking,this clustering method groups together the lexicalelements that are most similar to one anotherand, at the same time, the ones that are highlydissimilar to other elements in other clusters.Therefore, what we expect to see from this statis-tical method is a clustering dendrogram thatshows us which COME or GO verbs overlap intheir usage as opposed to the ones with whichthey hardly share any characteristics.This method requires generating a table thatlists relative frequencies (or proportions) of co-occurrence values of dependent variables perindependent variable (the GO and COME verbsunder study).
A similarity/dissimilarity matrix isfirst computed, followed by computing a clusterstructure based on a specific amalgamation rule.5The resulting cluster structure can then be visual-ly represented in a dendrogram.
The calculationsinvolved in the different stages of hierarchicalagglomerative cluster analysis have been madeeasier to conduct using BP 1.01 script, a programwritten by Stefan Gries (2009) for R. This R-based script uses a host of statistical methodsrequired in the stages mentioned above.
It initial-ly generates a co-occurrence table of relative fre-quencies of the different levels (IDTAG-LEVELs)within variables (IDTAGs).

This particular table can5 An amalgamation rule is what determines whether or nottwo items are sufficiently similar in order to be linked orclustered together.6 The idea of an ID tag was introduced by Atkins (1987) inher work on danger, where she examined collocates, colli-gations, POS, as well as other characteristics of the keyword.
An ID tag was therefore used to refer to the individualcontextual features co-occurring with the keyword.be subjected to a number of tests including thehierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis.
Forthis particular clustering technique I relied on the(dis)similarity metric ?Canberra?, and ?Ward?
asthe amalgamation rule that computes a clusterstructure.7The dendrogram in Figure 1 shows two ma-jor divides between the four verbs that the hier-archical agglomerative cluster analysis deemedsignificant.
The first cluster (on the left) formedin this analysis appears to group the verbs at?and ??
?a together, while the other cluster groups?a?ara and qadima together.
Here, we find thatthe AU p-value (Approximately Unbiased) ?which is a probability measure computed throughmulti-scale bootstrap resampling ?
for the clustercontaining ?a?ara and qadima is calculated toapproximate 87%, while the AU p-value for thecluster of at?
and ??
?a is 82%.
Again, this doesnot necessarily imply that ?a?ara and qadimaare highly similar, but that they are very dissimi-lar from at?
and ?a?a in their usage.
Indeed, sub-sequent mutli-variate as well as qualitative anal-yses showed that at?
and ??
?a shared more usagepatterns than they did with the other COME verbs.Figure 1.
Dendrogram based on the COME multi-variate data frame.4.3 Polytomous logistic regressionAnother multi-variate analysis that can beapplied to this kind of data frame for the purposeof examining patterns of variable interaction islogistic regression.
Polytomous logistic regres-sion analysis (explained in detail in Arppe,7 For a detailed description of this clustering method seeGries (2009), pp 306-319.332008), in particular, applies advanced algorithmsin order to determine the relative effects of mul-tiple predictor variables (the tags/contextual fea-tures) on the choice of more than two outcomevariables (i.e.
the four COME verbs and the threeGO verbs).
Generally speaking, logistic regres-sion would estimate probabilities of the occur-rence of each COME or GO verb given a particularcontext of use, and is therefore compatible withthe view that linguistic choices are probabilisticrather than categorical (Bresnan, 2006; Arppe,2007, 2008, 2009; among others).
In a nutshell,polytomous logistic regression estimates variableparameters which can be interpreted ?naturally?as odds (Harrell 2001).
In other words, it deter-mines the extent to which the existence of a vari-able (i.e.
feature/tag) in the context increases (ordecreases) the chances of a particular outcome(i.e.
verb) to occur, with all the other explanatoryvariables being equal.To illustrate, we can conduct such analysison the annotated COME data frame.
The first stepis to select a set of variables to include in themodel.
Note, however, that the binary and nomi-nal variables listed in Table 1 need to be con-verted into the form of logical variables in orderto be included in the logistic regression model.8The selection of these variables relies, first of all,on a mono-variate analysis (such as the inspec-tion of standardized Pearson?s residuals) as ameans of figuring out which variables seem tohave explanatory potential as opposed to thosethat do not.
A second criterion for variable selec-tion relies on inspecting pair-wise associationpatterns between variables.
That is to say, weneed to examine the extent to which certain vari-ables have a high rate of co-occurrence, as ameans of reducing collinearity in the regressionmodel.
The model listed in (5) includes 30 logi-cal variables as the independent variables and theCOME verb as a dependent variable.

When turned into logical variables, weend up with four different variables (TENSE_PRESENT,TENSE_PAST, TENSE_FUTURE and TENSE_NIL), the presence orabsence of which is indicated by TRUE or FALSE.SUBJ_CAT.COMMUNICATION +SUBJ_CAT.DEMONSTRATIVE + SUBJ_CAT.EVENT+ SUBJ_CAT.GROUP +  SUBJ_CAT.INDIVIDUAL +SUBJ_CAT.STATE + SUBJ_CAT.TIME + NEGA-TION.YES + PP.YES + LOC_ADV.YES + ADVERBI-AL.YES + GOAL.YES + SOURCE.YES +  MAN-NER.YES + SETTING.YES + PURPOSIVE.YES +COMITATIVE.YES + TEMPORAL.YESThe overall accuracy rate calculated for thismodel is 0.845.
The accuracy measure (Menard,1995: 28-30; Arppe, 2008: 129-132) correspondsto the number of times the model assigned thehighest probability estimate to the actually ob-served verb in a given annotated context.
We canalso examine the individual accuracy rates perverb as a means of zeroing in on which particularverb(s) the model was more successful in pre-dicting.
We can now examine the probabilityestimates that the polytomous logistic regressionanalysis assigns to each of the COME verbs perannotated context (4 verbs * 2,000 sentences).These estimated probabilities range from veryhigh values (approaching 1.00) to very low val-ues (approaching 0.00) and any values in be-tween, depending on the set of predictors (i.e.contextual features) present in a particular con-text of use.
We can illustrate with sentences (6)and (7) which are extracted from the original da-ta frame.
In (6) the verb received an almost cate-gorical probability estimate, while in (7) the verbreceived a less categorical probability estimate.
Itis also possible to examine the set of contextualfeatures that each sentences was tagged for andwhich were used as predictor variables in thelogistic regression model(6)at?

In (7), howev-er, note that the verb which received the highestprobability estimate was not the actually ob-served verb in that context.
Nevertheless, all fourverbs were assigned more-or-less equal probabil-ity estimates.
This may indicate that this is onecontext of use in which the four COME verbs canbe used interchangeably.
Relying on my nativespeaker intuition, substituting the observed verbwith the other COME verbs in (7) does not raiseany red flags, especially since this particular con-texts of use indicates physical motion of a HU-MAN agent, as I discussed earlier in this paper.Of course, not all predictions made by themodel were accurate.
Among the sentences forwhich a single verb received a very high proba-bility estimate, a number of instances in whichthe predicted verb was not the observed verbwere found.
Such sentences proved to be worthyof scrutiny due to the fact that some of these?mis-predictions?
were associated with less typi-cal uses of the verb that was actually observed incontext.
For instance, in (8), the verb qadimawas the verb observed in context, yet the modelchose ?a?ara instead as the verb that was mostfitting in that context.(8)at?

?lisa-haQuraysh meetings-CL.3SG.FQuraysh its meetings?When Ali bin Abdullah used to come to Meccaon a pilgrimage Quraysh would suspend itsmeetings?Interestingly, this particular usage ofqadima in (8) can be found in a specific genre,that of historical narrative.
While at?, ??
?a, and?a?ara may all appear in transitive constructionsin MSA, qadima normally does not.
It is, howev-er, used in transitive constructions to signal ashift in register, as in the example in (8).
Sincesuch pattern of use occurs less frequently thanthe general overall usage of qadima, the modelassigns ?a?ara instead as the most plausible verbchoice for such context.
Careful inspection of?mis-predictions?
such as the above is, therefore,an important step to identify the less typical usesof verbs, as well as to decide whether the varia-ble set chosen for the model has or has not beeneffective in accounting for verb usage.
The prob-ability estimates calculated for the GO data framedid not yield such satisfying results, and did notnecessarily agree with my native speaker?s intui-tion.
In Abdulrahim (2013: 101) I attributed suchfindings to the set of variables that GO verbswere coded for in the data frame (which, more orless, resembled the variable set COME verbs werecoded for).
More specifically I suggested that thedata frame should include more lexical orcollocational variables.5 ConclusionsThe methodological approach to lexicalanalysis, described here, represents a departurefrom traditional, compartmentalized treatmentsof the Arabic verb.
In this paper, I have adopteda construction-based approach that considers var-ious aspects of language (morphology, syntax,semantics, etc.)
as equally responsible for defin-35ing the behavior of a linguistic item.
The creationof a 500-row data frame per verb has allowed usto probe into the frequency and distribution factsregarding the usage of seven highly frequent mo-tion verbs in MSA.
Moreover, the annotation ofeach corpus return for a wide range of contextualand semantic features offered the possibility offoregrounding the most prototypical aspects ofuse for each verb, as well as highlighting sharedpatterns of usage among the near-synonymousverbs in a set.
In this paper, I have argued thatthe value of constructing a data frame of thistype lies in developing more sophisticatedlexico-syntactic frames of linguistic items, in thatit allows us to extract preferred profiles of thelexical or constructional items under study.Thankfully, there is a wide range of statisti-cal tests that have made the examination of andsearch for lexico-syntactic patterns in large dataframes easier and more manageable.
These sta-tistical tests vary from simple, mono-variate ex-ploratory test to complex and multi-variate pre-dictive models.
Each one of the three statisticalanalyses discussed in this paper serves to high-light a particular aspect of variable distributionand variable interaction and, thus, helps us un-derstand the complexity of the relationship be-tween the near-synonymous COME and GO verbs.Generally speaking, the application of such sta-tistical tests to large, multi-variate data frameshelps us examine the particular linguistic featuresthat characterize lexical and constructionalchoices, which may have direct applications innatural language generation.
In addition, theidentification of prototypical and marginal usesof verbs ?
discussed particularly in 4.3 ?
canpossibly contribute to developing readability as-sessment of texts for learners of MSA.9Finally, lexicographic treatments of thehighly frequent motion verbs discussed in thispaper, as exhibited in bilingual and, mostly,monolingual dictionaries, range from almost ad-equate to completely mis-representative descrip-tions of the major and minor senses of theseverbs (Abdulrahim, 2013).
Many monolingualdictionaries follow a traditional and highly ideo-logical system of lexical representation wherebyarchaic uses of a lexical item are foregroundedand little attention is paid to more contemporaryuses.
The quantitative (and qualitative) analysisof a data frame such as the ones described here9 I would like to thank an anonymous reviewers of this pa-per for pointing out these particular applications of the sta-tistical methods discussed here.can help tease apart the different idiosyncraticuses for each of the seven motion verbs as wellas identify the most and the least prototypicaluses.
One of the practical applications of such adata frame, therefore, is to create extensive, us-age-based dictionary entries that are more repre-sentative of contemporary language use and thatwould be useful for the native speaker of the lan-guage, the language learner, and the languageresearcher.10AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Professors AnttiArppe, John Newman, and Sally Rice at the Uni-versity of Alberta for their constant guidance andfeedback throughout the various stages of thecreation of this data frame, the application ofstatistical tests, and the linguistic analysis.
