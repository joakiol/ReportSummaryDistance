Proceedings of SIGDIAL 2010: the 11th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, page 175,The University of Tokyo, September 24-25, 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsInvited TalkUnderstanding Humans by Building AndroidsHiroshi IshiguroProfessor of Department of Systems Innovation, Osaka UniversityATR Fellow and visiting group leader of ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communication laboratoriesIn the near future, we are going to use interactive humanoids in our daily life.
They will providevarious services by using the communication functions.
In order to realize the robot society, we have toinvestigate many issues.The ideal humanoid is a human since the human brain has functions to recognize humans.
Thismeans that we need to study human for building more humanlike robots.
Once we get deeply into thisfundamental question, the many issues come up, such as humanlike appearance, humanlike movement,and so on.This talk introduces a series of androids that have been developed for tackling the issues and theresearch topics.
Although it is difficult to solve completely the issues, they brings us new ideas on whathuman is.
In other words, this research approach bridges robotics and not only cognitive science andneuroscience but also philosophy.175
