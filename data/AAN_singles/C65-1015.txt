K le ineckeTECHNICAL  MIL ITARY PLANNING OPERATIONGENERAL ELECTRIC  COMPANY735 State St reet  (P. O. Drawer  QQ)SANTA BARBARA,  CAL IFORNIA  9310ZAbst rac tLexical decay is the phenomenon underlying the dating tech-niques known as "glottochronology" and"lexicostatistics."
Much  ofthe contraversial nature of work  in this field is the result of extremelyimprecise foundations and lack of attention to the underlying statisticaland semantic models.A satisfactory semantic mode l  can be found in the concept of se-mantic atom.
Notwithstanding a number  of philosophical objections,the semantic a tom is an operationally feasible support for a lexiconwhich is a semantic subset of all possible meanings and at the sametime, exhausts the vocabulary of a language.
Lexical decay is theprocess by which the lexical item covering an a tom is replaced byanother lexical item.Exponential lexical preservation is, in this model, directlyanalogous to decay phenomena in nuclear physics.
Consistency re-quires that the decay process involved in exponentially preservedvocabularies be a Poisson process.
This shows how to form testvocabularies for dating and proves that presently used vocabulariesare not correctly formed.Dialectation studies show that historically diverging populationsmust  be model led by correlated Poisson processes.
Definitive sta-tistical treatment of these questions is not possible at this time, butmuch desirable research can be indicated.K le inecke  - IIn t roduct ionTh is  paper  is  an a t tempt  to es tab l i sh  the  method  of  dat ing  bylex ica l  decay  upon an adequate  theoret i ca l  foundat ion .
The  methodd iscussed  is  that  invented  by Swadesh  (1) over  a decade  ago  andusua l ly  known as  g lo t tochrono logy  or  lex icos ta t i s t i cs .
In  the  in ter -ven ing  years  i t  has  been  w ide ly  app l ied ,  but  o f ten  to the accompa-n iment  of  much confus ion  and  cont raversy .
It  seems that  much ofthe  confus ion  can  be removed by a r igorous  t reatment  of  the  phenom-eno log ica l  mode l  and  care fu l  app l i ca t ion  of  s ta t i s t i cs .

La terwe t ry  to assemble  some arguments  wh ich  jus t i fy  the mode l .
In nosense is this an approach for first principles.The analogy between lexical decay and the decay phenomenaof nuclear physics has been often noted and dismissed.
In the pre-sent paper, we  insist that this analogy is much more  than an analogy;it is, on the first level, an identity.
The only alternative to thishypothesis seems to be a kind of myst ic  faith that the decay occursbut without palpable manipulable principles.
The burden of the proofthat the identity is false lies with the doubter and we will make  nofurther demonstrat ion of its validity.Kleinecke - ZDecay phenomena in nuclear physics are governed by relativelysimple, well understood principles.
To apply these results to lexicaldecay we first establish the concepts of a semantic a tom and a set ofindependent semantic atoms.
The observed fact of exponential decayof vocabulary then is accounted for by assuming that the lexical itemcovering an a tom decays according to a Poisson process.
Oenerallyspeaking, the converse of this is also true,and only a Poisson processwould produce exponential decay.
F rom these considerations, wecan draw many conclusions about how to and how not to construct testvocabularies for dating purposes.With this mode l  in hand, we  can draw conclusions of a statisticalnature.
For  example, we  can develop formulas for the proper methodof dating the split between three or more  languages and for good esti-mators  in more  complex  situations.We can construct an inprecise heuristic model  for the dynamicsemantics underlying the Poisson process.
So long as the first ordertheory is adequate, this is much in the nature of a curiosity.
It seems,however, that first order theory is not adequate.
Actually, such aconclusion is really premature  because the kind of verification studiesneeded have not been made.
Assuming  the pessimistic conclusion, wehave to construct second (or higher) order theories to account for theinadequacies of first order theory.
At the moment ,  we  have no usefulresults in this direction--the prob lem merges  into the prob lem ofdialectation.
Probably the most  important service we can render isto indicate exactly what kind of detailed studies are needed.Semantic AtomsIt is very easy to raise objections of a philosophical nature tothe concept of a semantic atom.
In this paper we will simply ignoreKleinecke - 3these objections and define semantic a tom in an operational way.There  are also operational difficulties, but these seem to be sur-mountable.A semantic a tom is aciently specified to removecompletely defined unit concept suffi-all ambiguity.
For  example,  in ananthropological context, we  might have "sun, as pointed at by a maleanthropologist at high noon in the middle of summer  on an averageday among a group of young men with plenty to drink".
The kind ofsubtilities needed to complete the definition reminds  one of Korzybsk ianGeneral  Semantics, but the intention is not the same.
We seek toremove ambiguity but we must  have a non-unique concept--one that isalways present.Certainly there has been little use of semantic a toms anywherein the past.
Those interested in semantics for its own self will rejectthem as useless or meaningless; lexographers deal in more  generalizedconcepts.
It would be hard to argue that they have general utility, butthey are precisely what is needed for studying lexical decay.Each  semantic atom, in any speech at any time, is assumed tobe covered by some lexical item.
That is, there is some word  whosemean ing  includes that of the atom.
Thus, vocabularies can be fo rmedover any set of semantic a toms by listing the covering lexical i temfor each atom.
The kind of decay being studied is that where  the cov-ering lexical i tem is replaced by another item.
The replaced wordonly rarely immediate ly  disappears f rom the language as a whole, butit has  disappeared f rom the semantic atom.An  independent set of semantic a toms is a set of a toms all ofwhich differ among themselves enough to make the decay at any a tomcompletely independent of that at any other atom.
Thus, only one f romsets of words, like numera ls  or pronouns, with habitual interrelationsK le inecke  - 4can appear i n  the set.
Independent sets are useful because inthem, prob lems of inter-atom correlations need not be considered.Before passing on, we  should say a few words  as to the prac-tical use of semantic atoms.
There  does not seem to be any doubtthat the collectors of vocabularies want  to work  with semantic a toms- -even if their results are completely unsuccessful.
In an entry "dog=hund" they would  like to say that there is a semantic a tom and its coverin English is "dog", in German,  "hund".
The pitfalls of this sort ofthing are wel l -known.
Some care in defining atoms might  make itfeasible if we  require not complete identity of the English and Germansemantics, but rather the existence of some concrete concept whereboth the English and German words  are appropriate.
Clearly this muchweaker  requi rement  will be easier to satisfy, so we adopt it.We conclude that, with adequate precautions, semantic a tomscan be operationally feasible even if true rigor is impossible.
In thecase of little-known languages, there is much more  chance for error.We should encourage collectors of vocabularies to improve  the pre-cision of their definitions so that the a tom in question can be identified.Decay  ProcessWe assume that lexical decay, for a set of independent semant icatoms, is a Po isson process.
That is, it satisfies three conditions:i.
Each  a tom decays independently of all the other atoms.2.
Each  a tom decays independently of its history of earlierde c ay.3.
There  is a constant k such that for each a tom the pro-bability of one decay in a short t ime interval At is kAt,and the probability of more  than one decay is negligible.Kle inecke  - 5It is rather easy to deduce that for longer time intervals t ,the probability of not decaying is exp(-It) , and if there are N atoms,the expected  number  of undecayed atoms a f te r  t ime t is Nexp( - l t ) .Th is  fo rmula  is the usua l  fo rmula  fo r  lex ica l  decay .
It shou ldbe po in ted  out  that  it  was  tes ted ,  s ta t i s t i ca l ly ,  in the f i r s t  pub l i ca t ionby Swadesh ,  and it fa i led  to pass .
The d i f f i cu l ty  is p robab ly  due tothe word  l i s t  used  wh ich  is  not  an independent  set  of a toms.If we examine  the assumpt ions  made so fa r ,  we see  that  anyl i s t  of semant ic  a toms can  be used  i f  they  are :  (1) independent ;  and(2) assured  of ex is tence  throughout  he t ime in quest ion .
There  is  nosat i s fac tory  a pr io r i  bas i s  fo r  assuming  that  some k inds  of semant ica toms decay  at d i f fe rent  ra tes  than o ther  k inds ,  and it  is doubt fu l  i fenough h is tor i ca l  ev idence  can  be co l lec ted  to make such a conc lus ions tat i  s t i ca l ly  s ign i f i cant .The quest ion  whether  l is a un iversa l  constant ,  a constantw i th in  any  one language but poss ib ly  d i f fe r ing  between languages ,  o ra var iab le ,  is eas ie r  to d i scuss .
So fa r ,  ind icat ions  are  that  k isabout  equa l  to 1 /5000 years .
Now th is  means  that  over  the span ofmost  h i s to r i c  ev idence ,  exp( -k t )  wi l l  be greater  than about  0.
60.There  is a great  dea l  of scat ter  to be expected  in the resu l ts  becauseN exp( -k t )  is an expectat ion ,  not  an exact  p red ic t ion .There  have  been a number  of s tud ies  of  the exponent  of  expo-nent ia l  decay .
Al l  of them are  too super f i c ia l  to be conc lus ive  (Z) .An adequate  s tudy  in any  one language wou ld  have  to meet  severa lc r i te r ia  wh ich  make it into a major  research  e f fo r t .
A set  of inde-pendent  semant ic  a toms must  be se lec ted- -se lec ted  pr io r  to deta i leds tudy- -and  no a toms,  however  d i f f i cu l t ,  d ropped w i thout  completeexp lanat ions  (3).
Then  the h i s tory  of each  a tom must  be t raced  throughthe h i s tor i ca l  record  to locate  the lex ica l  i tem cover ing  the a tom atKleinecke - 6each point in time.
In reporting the study, all of this should be fullydocumented  in detail.
Each  instance of decay can then be recognizedand tallied.
Statistical tests should be applied to see whether or notthe mode l  is satisfied and to estimate )~ .
For  example, if there arei00 semantic i tems T, there should be about one decay every 50 yearsuniformly spread through time.
These things can be checked statis-tically.
We hope that scholars will undertake definitive studies of thistype for as many cases as possible (4).Until the results of the kind of research just ment ioned are avail-able, the status of ~ is unsure.
We anticipate it will be recognizedas a universal constant.There  remains  the prob lem of mak ing  a Poisson process a rea-sonable assumption.
In other words, we  need to describe some sortof mechan ism which makes  words  slip off semantic atoms independentlyof how long they have been covering the atom, and at a constant rateper unit time, at least over short t ime intervals.
Incidentally,since )~ is on the order of 1/5000 years, 50 years is a short timeinterval.
Since the speakers of normal  languages are not historians,the independence f rom history seems easy to accept.The constant rate is harder to accept.
First of all we  have toaccount for an identical figure in populations, literate and illiterate,and between a handful of speakers and half a billion speakers.
Thedecay effect must  be independent of the number  of speakers, hence itmust  be operative at the level of the single isolated speaker.
This issatisfactory since, by and large, the amount  of speech reaching anindividual does not seem to have changed much throughout history anddoes not vary much between cultures at the present day.But why  does a speaker decide to change an occasional lexicali tem--about i~0 in his lifetime--and maintain the rest.
The onlyKleinecke - 7hypothesis we  have been able to construct is that all words  are alwaysunder pressure - -perhaps  f rom several semantic  "directions" at thesame time.
Most  a toms resist change most  of the time, but some setof accidents (all very real events at the sociological and psychologicallevels, but random accidents in our context) weakens  a few, and thelexicon decays.
In other words, there is a constant dynamic  move-ment  among secondary and incidental covers of the semantic a tomwhich threaten the principal cover.
Usually the threatening lexicali tems recede, but occasionally, in a random way, about once everyfive thousand years the principal cover is displaced and a lexical de-cay occurs.The hypothetical mechan ism advanced to explain lexical decaycan be checked against history by case studies of semantic atoms.Each  a tom should show time periods when the principal word  wasnearly displaced.
During these periods it is difficult to decide whetherthe old word  or a new word  is the principal cover.
Usually the newword  will pass away again, but somet imes  it will displace the old word.A very tentative guess based on a casual examination of one hundredcurrent English words  suggests there are about four very heavilythreatened words  per hundred.
Since we can expect about one wordto be decaying at this moment ,  we  conclude that about three out offour times the old word  survives.
All of this needs to be verified ordisproven in detailed studies.Decay  StatisticsThe statistical consequences of the model - - the first order mode ldescribed above- -need to be explored.
We cannot handle all possiblesituations, but the following examples  should provide an adequate dem-onstration of technique so that any other p rob lems which occur can besolved in the same manner .Kle inecke  - 8F i r s t ,  l e t  us  cons ider  N languages  dev ia t ing  independent ly  f roma common parent  wh ich  is not  known to us .

A max imum liklihood estimate for x seems tobe the best single value we can assign to x .
This is obtained bysetting the (logarithmic) derivative of probability to zero so that0 = A-k '  NK-A  + (N-  l)k'x l -x  i + (N- l )xwhere  A = k' + Zk s + 3k s + ... + Nk  N .

For  general N ,  is the solution of theXquatratic equation given above.
Note that the answer  depends on thestatistic A which does not usually appear in discussions of lexicaldating.An  even more  general difference between this treatment andusual treatment by pairs is found in the use made of the number  of allthe languages containing a certain lexical i tem as the cover of a se-mantic  atom.
This kind of count is a lmost  never made in the literatureon dating problems.Another  case which constantly recurs in practice is that of threelanguages; i, 2 and 3, say.
"The pair 1 and 2 are more  closelyKle inecke - Iirelated than language 3 is to either I or ?

Suppose  t is t imef rom the common ancestor  of i, 2 and 3 to 3, and t' the t imef rom the common ancestor of 1 and 2 to 1 or Z.
Let x=exp(- I t )  ,x = exp(-kt') so that x/x' is the probability associated with thet ime f rom the common ancestor of I, Z and 3 to that of 1 and 2.We might  observe  any of five situations concerning the coverof a semant ic  atom.

In every case we obtain new formulas based onmax imum liklihood estimators.
Another area in which these methodscould also be utilized is in the construction of significance tests andconfidence bands.
With this basis, most  of the mach inery  of modernstatistics wou ld  be available for use.Crit icism of First Order  TheoryAs  we explained in discussing semantic atoms, we  feel there isno adequate observational data to which to apply these formulas for aconclusive test of their value.
We have made a few experimentalapplications using the unsatisfactory data available in the literature.Numerical ly,  the time estimates we obtained, which we willnot quote here, do not differ a great deal f rom those obtained by con-sidering pairs alone.
This is to be expected if the phenomena are atall consistent.
The  value in the formulas derived above lies in thefact that they correctly combine  the data f rom several pairs.The  first-order method does have one very important difficultywhich appears a lmost  immediate ly  if we  try to treat more  than threelanguages.
This difficulty is in the family tree of the languages.In the entire first-order development, we  have implicitly usedthe concept of a tree.
Languages  go together as a "common ancestor"Kleinecke - 13until some point in t ime when they divide and become two separatelanguages.
The  tree is the first-order mode l  of dialectation--it isknown to be inadequate, at least in many situations.
In spite of acentury or so of studies, we  simply do not understand how dialec-tation occurs.
More  study is greatly needed, especially in the con-struction of h igher-order  models,  but the prob lem lies outside thescope of this paper.The difficulty with the tree rises in decay studies because onlysplitting is compatible with our statistical model.
We have no alter-native to constructing a family tree if we  wish to apply the methodoutlined above.
However ,  it seems to be easy to find examples  whichdo not allow a tree to be constructed.
Consider four languages; A ,B, C and D .
Suppose one semantic a tom has the same cover in Aand B, and another different cover in C and D .
And  at the sametime, some other a tom has one cover in A and C , and a differentcover in B and D. We cannot fit this data into any family tree.A little more  specifically in the Romance  languages, we  findthat the same innovation with respect to Latin is shared by several orall the later languages.
Some of this can be explained by the colloquialversus learned speech theory, but no family tree can be constructedto explain all the combinations of innovations.
If we  had an adequateexplanation of the phenomena involved in these shared innovations, itis quite possible that we  could assume Romance  was  the direct descen-dent of Imperial  Latin without going back to Plautus or thereabouts,as seems to be required by the first order theory.A tentative beginning in this direction can be made by a second-order theory based on the dynamic  mode l  of lexical influence.Kleinecke - 14Second-Order  Lex ica l  DecayThe  imprec ise  mode l  of  semant ic  p ressures  we fo rmed toexp la in  lex ica l  decay  suggests  the  fo l low ing  second-order  mode l .For  each  semant ic  a tom,  we cons ider  not  on ly  a cover inglex ica l  i tem as  be fore ,  but  a l so  a potent ia l  cover ing  i tem.
The  poten-t ia l  cover  is  the  source  of  p ressure  aga ins t  the  cover .
When thecover  decays ,  i t  i s  rep laced  by the  potent ia l  cover .
Natura l ly  wea l so  assume that  the  potent ia l  cover  decays  and  is  rep laced  by anew potent ia l  cover .
In the  in teres t  of  s imp l i c i ty  and  because  wehave  no numer ica l  data ,  we w i l l  assume both  decays  have  the sameconstant kFirst, let us consider a single language.
The situation at ana tom can be of four types: (1) both the original cover and potentialcover remain; (If) the original cover remains, but the potentialcover has decayed; (III) the original cover has decayed and the poten-tial cover has replaced it; (IV) the cover is now neither the originalnor the potential cover.Let Pl and PII be the probability of the first two situations.Thend~'-t PI = "ZXP I  '= -k PII + XP I  ;so thatPl = exp(-Zit) ,Kle inecke - 15PII = exp(-Xt) (I - exp(-%t))The or ig ina l  cover  remains  in these  two cases  on ly  so that  the prob-ab i l i ty  of it remain ing  isP I  + P I I  = exp( -k t )wh ich  is  exact ly  the same as  in f i r s t -o rder  theory .When the  second-order  theory  is  app l ied  to N languages ,  theresu l t s  a re  qu i te  compl i ca ted .

We then observe that the covers are either thesame or different.
If they are the same,  we have either I~ I = 2 andIYI = 161 = 0 ,or  I~{I = 2 and IT\]I = 161 = 0 Thus, the probability is\[exp(-kt)\] s + \[exp(-kt)\] s \[i - exp(-kt)\] s= exp(-Zkt) \[i + (i exp(-kt)) s\]which differs f rom the first order theory by the te rm in the squarebracket.The simplest case where  the second-order theory is really re-quired is that of four languages.
We will illustrate the results by oneexpression.
If kss words  are covered by two items both in two lan-guages, k4 words  by one i tem in all languages, k 8 by one i tem inthree languages, k s by one item in two languages, and k' by nocommon items,then the expression to be solved for max imum liklihoodis4kss + 4k4 + 3k s +2k s 2kss  + k 3 + 3ks  + 5k 'p 1 - pKleinecke - 174k 4(I _ p)S ks(3 4p + 4p s)2 - 4p + 6p ~ - 4p ~ + p%" + 2 + 3p - 2p~ + p4k s (4 - Zp  - 3p s)+ 2 + 4p - p~ - p3 +k'(5 + 6p + 9p 2)+ 5p + 3p s + 3p swhere  p = exp(-%t) .This second-order  theory is not satisfactory not only becauseit leads to very complex  formulas, but it also seems to be qualita-tively inadequate.
The formula for splitting between two languagesis not greatly modif ied except for very long times, and the changedoes not seem to be enough to account for data showing short t imesof division.
It is hard to tell whether  the formula for several lan-guages including the quantity k2e is any help--so far we  have nostriking results to quote f rom its use.A second-order  theory where  potential cover decayed at adifferent rate than the original cover might  correct some of thesedefects, but we  have no evidence upon which to estimate the decayrate in this case.
It is much likely that a more  elaborate mechan ismmust  be postulated--it need not lead to more  elaborate results.
Themode l  must  be based on a kind of dialectation study which seems tobe absent as yet f rom the literature.ConclusionWe have derived a number  of formulas relating to the estimationof t ime depths by observations of lexical decay.
The methods  usedcan be applied to obtain many more  similar formulas as required instudies of actual data.All of these formulas are based on mode ls  of lexical decay usingthe concept of semantic a toms and their lexical covers.

Attemptsto " improve" the test vocabulary by limiting it to mean-ings which have behaved well in earlier studies are meth-odologically disasterous because they bias the value of k.This requirement is also intended to remove bias f romthe estimate of k .This is a matter of classical philological research inde-pendent of statistical syntheses made f rom the results.
