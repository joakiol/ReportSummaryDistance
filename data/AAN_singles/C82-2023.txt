As Thompson and Thompson 1981s660 obselwez "monotonyof  s t ruc ture  i s  the ru le  ra the~ than the except ion  in  homan--computer communicat ion."
Thompson 1981"41 repor ts  in  herstudy of such communications that 75 percent of the querieswere wh-quest ions ,  1% percent  were commands, 5 percent  weres ta tements ,  and 1 percent  were yes /no  quest ions .The repet i t i ve  feature  o f  natura l  language i s  not a newconcept .

Becketc la ims  that  " the wonderfu l  feats  of  the homan in te l lec t .
.
,  arebased as much on memor izat ion  as on any impromptu problem--solving" (1975:62).
He posits a phrasal lexicon oonslstln~of six major categories of lexioal phrases by which we "stitchtcgether  swatches of  text  that  we have hear~ before |  p roduct -i ve  processes  have the secondary ro le  of  adapt ing  the o ldphrases to the new situations" (1975z60)oAll of these approaches to natural languaEe data relyheavily on the observation that many lexlcal items tend- 106  -co-occur .

A study of  word sequences in  PANALOG text  hasshown a surpr i s ing  amount of repet i t ion  of  word sequences(Bienstock and Smith in preparation).
(PANALOG is a systemfor passing messages among small ~oups  in computer confer-enclng with telemall and calendar features.
See Housman 1979.The data are of human-homan communication and not homan--computer cc~.,nunication and are thematically restricted.
Theythere fore  resemble Damerau's data . )

In  par t i cu la r ,  recur r ing  two words t r ings  account fo r  40.8 percent  of the runn ing  text  and re -cu~r ing  three  word s t r ings  comprise 8.1 percent  of the text .The bas ic  assumpt ion of the f requent  occurrence of lex ic -a l  co l locat ion  in  natu l -a l  language texts ,  espec ia l l y  inh,- ,an-ocmputer communication, i s the bas is  fo r  the developmentof a new type of natura l  language processor .
Ford, 1981, hasconst ructed  a natura l  languaEe process ing  system for  databaseupdat ing,  re t r ieva l ,  and man ipu la t iont  which re l ies  c r i t i ca l l yon the observat ion  that  rea l  users  tend to employ a veryl im i ted  set  .of lex ica l  d t r i~  types in  query i~ databases .The Ford natura l  language processor  cons is ts  of a twos tage reduct ion  a lgor i thm for  ~rans la t ing  natura l  languaEs in -puts  in to  bas ic  funct ions  which are then used to perform thequery.
The f i r s t  s tags  of the reduct ion  changes the input  wordsto meaning representat ions  usinE a l i s t  of lex ioa l  i tems anda meaning cor re la te  l i s t .
The second stage takes as inputs t r ings  of these meaning cor re la tes  and oha~es  them in tobas ic  l l s t .409 numeric representat ions  fo r  words mapped down to 132unique meanings and 1328 canon ica l  sentence vectors  mapped down- 108  -to 19 funct ions .
This two stage reduct ion  scheme workede f f i c ient ly  enough to respond to 93.8 percent  of the 1697 i n -put quer ies ,  inc lud ing  ungrammatical  ones from inexper iencedusers ,  wi th  a response t ime of 1.5 seconds,  operat ing  in  anenvironment of 90K 8 -b i t  bytes .
This compares very favorab lyto  Thompson 1981 where only 67.7 percent  of REL quer ies  werecor rec t ly  parsed with  an average response time of 10 seconds.
(Space requi rements  were not repor ted . )
S imi la r ly ,  Damerau1981 and Pat r i ck  1981 repor t  a success ra te  fo r  TQA of 65.1percent  inputs  cor rec t ly  parsed with  the time requ i red  toprocess a sentence typ ica l ly  being 10 seconds.The reason why the system works so we l l  in  terms ofaccuracy,  speed, and smal l  s torage reqa i rements  i  based onthe two s tags  reduct ion  technique which, in  t~rn ,  i s  based onthe fac t  that  a great  ma~v inputs  in  human-computer communic-a t ion  are repetitious syntactically, semantically, and lexl-~ally.
Repetition is a principal characteristic of human--computer communication.REFERENCESBecket, Joseph, 1975.
