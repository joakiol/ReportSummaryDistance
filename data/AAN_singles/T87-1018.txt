Whither Discourse n.nd Speech Acts?Barbax~ J. GrossHarvard UniversityCambridge Massachusetts 02138In addition to the questions initially posed on discourse theory and speech acts(and listed in the proceedings), the panelists were asked to consider how their beliefsabout discourse and speech acts had changed in the last five or so years, and in partic-ular to consider the following two questions:Of what you believed about discourse five years ago, what nowstrikes you as most  wrong?What are you less confused about now than five years ago?The panelists papers and a glance through the proceedings of the previous twoT INLAP meetings uggests that we have in fact learned a good deal and that researchin discourse and speech act theory has become much more focused in the last five orso years.
Several theories of discourse have been proposed to account for the struc-ture and processing of extended sequences of utterances.
In a recent paper\[Grosz&Sidner86\], Candy Sidner and I present one such theory and discuss a range ofalternative ones.
Other research has provided partial accounts for the interpretationand generation in discourse of individual expressions, clauses, and interclausal connec-tions (e.g., \[McKeown85\], \[Appelt85\], \[Groszeta183\], \ [Mann&Thompson83\]\[Sidner83\], \[Webber83\],\[Hobbs79\]).
These theories differ in the predictions they?
make about discourse structure and coherence, and about the processing of varioustypes of linguistic expressions (e.g., cue phrases, definite descriptions, and pronouns).Initial psychological investigations into various aspects of these theories are being car-ried out.One of the most  striking changes is that research on discourse and speech acttheories now typically addresses more specific questions, a fact illustrated by the papersfor this panel.
In addressing the role of research on speech for discourse, Hirschbergdescribes results that reveal the crucial role of information provided in the speech sig-nal; she argues that simpler solutions to many discourse problems are available only ifone does not ignore speech.
Perrault discusses various key problems that arise in tak-ing seriously the intuitions underlying "speech act theory,"  in looking in detail at whatit means to say that utterances are actions that most  directly affect the mental  state ofthe participants in the discourse; he indicates the variety of approaches being taken tospecific problems within this framework and their connection to work more generallyin natural-language s mantics.Another  clear difference from the previous two T INLAP meetings is the moregeneral acknowledgement of the pervasiveness of the role of intentions and plans indiscourse.
These affect not  only the interpretation of individual utterances, but also ofextended sequences of utterances and of individual phrases within an utterance.
Thisrecognition has led to a close examination of theories of planning and action; it hasbecome clear that work in AI on planning is insufficient to support  discourse86processing.
Wilensky argues for much more complex notions of plans and goals tosupport discourse processing; he describes a range of discourse problems requiringthese and indicates research directed toward developing them.
Other recent research(e.g., \[Pollack86\], [iautz&Allen86\]) has examined the adequacy of current models ofplanning for plan recognition and developed alternative models better able to supportdiscourse processing.In brief, we seem to have gotten much closer to understanding what the prob-lems, are; there is still much to do -- and much disagreement about how -- to solvethese problems.References:\[Appelt85\] Appelt, D. 1985 Planning English Referring Expressions.
