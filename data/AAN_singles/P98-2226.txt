Translating IdiomsEr ic  Wehr l i  ?Laboratoire d'analyse t de technologie du langageUniversity of Genevawehrli@latl.unige.chAbst rac tThis paper discusses the treatment of fixed wordexpressions developed for our ITS-2 French-English translation system.
This treatmentmakes a clear distinction between compounds- i.e.
multiword expressions of X?-level inwhich the chunks are adjacent - and idiomaticphrases - i.e.
multiword expressions of phrasalcategories, where the chunks are not necessar-ily adjacent.
In our system, compounds arehandled during the lexical analysis, while id-ioms are treated in the syntax, where they aretreated as "specialized lexemes".
Once rec-ognized, an idiom can be transfered accord-ing to the specifications of the bilingual dic-tionary.
We will show several cases of trans-fer to corresponding idioms in the target lan-guage, or to simple lexemes.
The complete sys-tem, including several hundreds of compoundsand idioms can be consulted on the Internet(ht tp ://latl.unige.ch/itsweb.html).1 In t roduct ionMultiword expressions (henceforth MWE), areknown to constitute a serious problem for nat-ural language processing (NLP) 1.
In the caseof translation, a proper treatment of MWE isa fundamental requirement, as few customerswould tolerate a literal translation of such com-mon expressions as entrer en vigueur 'to comeinto effect', mettre en oeuvre 'to implement' ,faire preuve 'to show' or faire connaissance 'tomeet '."
I am grateful to Anne Vandeventer, Christopher Laen-zlinger and Thierry Etchegoyhen for helpful comments.Part of the work described in this paper has been sup-ported by a grant from CTI (grant no 2673.1).zCf.
Abeill~ & Schabes (1989), Arnold et al (1995),Laporte (1988), Schenk (1995), Stock (1989), amongothers.However, a simple glance at some of the cur-rent commercial translation systems hows thatnone of them can be said to handle MWEs in anappropriate fashion.
As a matter of fact, someof them explicitely warn their users not to usemultiword expressions.In this paper, we will first stress some fun-damental properties of two classes of MWEs,compounds  and id ioms,  and then present hetreatment of idioms developed for our French-English ITS-2 translation system (cf.
Ram-luckun & Wehrli, 1993).2 Compounds and idiomsA two-way partition of MWEs in (i) compoundsand (ii) idioms is both convenient and theo-retically well-motivated 2.
Compounds are de-fined as MWEs of X?-level (ie.
word level), inwhich the chunks are adjacent, as exemplified in(1), while "idiomatic expressions" correspond toMWEs of phrasal evel, where chunks may notbe adjacent, and may undergo various syntacticoperations, as exemplified in (2-3).(1)a.
pomme de terre 'potato'b.
~ cause de 'because of'c.
d~s lors que 'as soon as'The compounds given in (1) function, respec-tively, as noun, preposition and conjunction.They correspond to a single unit, both syntac-tically and semantically.
In contrast, idiomaticexpressions do not generally constitute fixed,closed syntactic units.
They do, however, be-have as semantic units.
For instance the com-plex syntactic expression casser du sucre sur ledos de quelqu'un, literally break some sugar on~This distinction between compounds and idioms isalso discussed in Wehrli (1997)1388somebody's back is essentially synonymous withcriticize.(2)a.
Jean a forc~ la main ~ Luc.Jean has forced the hand to Luc'Jean twisted Luc's hand'b.
C'est ~ Luc que Jean a forc~ la main.It is to Luc that Jean has forced thehand'It is Luc's hand that Jean has twisted'c.
C'est & Luc que Paul pretend que Jeana voulu forcer la main.It is to Luc that Paul claims that Jeanhas wanted to force the hand'It is Luc's hand that Paul claims thatJean has wanted to force'd.
La main semble lui avoir ~t~ un peuforc~e.The hand hand seems to him to havebeen a little forced'His hand seems to have been some-what twisted'The idiom il lustrated in (2) is typical of avery large class of idioms based on a verbalhead.
Syntactically, such idioms correspond toverb phrases, with a fixed direct object argu-ment (la main, in our example) and an openindirect object argument.
Notice that this verbphrase is completely regular in its syntactic be-haviour.
In particular, it can can undergo syn-tactic operations uch as adverbial modification,raising, passive, dislocation, etc., as examplifiedin (2b-d).With example (3), we have a much less com-mon pattern, since the subject argument ofthe verb constitutes a chunk of the expression.Here, again, various operations are possible, in-cluding passive and raising ~(3)a. Quelle mouche a piqu~ Paul?
'What has gotten to Paul?'b.
Quelle mouche semble l'avoir pique?
'What seems to have gotten to him'c.
Je me demande par quelle mouche Paula ~t~ pique.
'I wonder what's gotten to him'3Another interesting example of idiom with fixed sub-ject is la moutarde monte au nez de NP  ( "NP looses histemper"), discussed in Abeille and Schabes (1989).The extent to which expressions can undergomodifications and other syntactic operationscan vary tremendously from one expression tothe next, and in the absence of a general ex-planation for this fact, each expression must berecorded with the llst of its particular propertiesand constraints 4.Given the categorial distinction (X ?
vs. XP)and other fundamental differences sketchedabove, compounds and idioms are treated verydifferently in our system.
Compounds are sim-ply listed in the lexicon as complex lexical units.As such, their identification belongs to the lexi-cal analysis component.
Once a compound hasbeen recognized, its treatment in the ITS-2 sys-tem does not differ in any interesting way fromthe treatment of simple words.While idiomatic expressions must also belisted in the lexicon, their entries are far morecomplex than the ones of simple or compoundwords (cf.
section 3.2).
As for their identifica-tion, it turns out to be a rather complex oper-ation, which cannot be reliably carried out at asuperficial level of representation.
As we saw inthe above examples, idiom chunks can be foundfar away from the (verbal) head with which theyconstitute an expression; they can also be mod-ified in various ways, and so on.
Preprocessingidioms, for instance during the lexical analysis,might therefore lead to lengthy, inefficient or un-reliable treatments.
We will argue that in orderto drastically simplify the task of identifying id-ioms, it is necessary to undo whatever syntac-tic operations they might have undergone.
Toput it differently, idioms can best be recognizedon the basis of a normalized structure, a struc-ture in which constituents occur in their canon-ical position.
In a generative grammar frame-work, normalized structures correspond to D-structure representations.
At that level, for in-stance, the four sentences in (2), share the com-mon structure in (4).
(4) ... \[ Vp forcer \[ DP la main\] \[ pp/t X\] \]As we will show in the next section, our treat-ment of idiomatic expression takes advantage of4See for instance Nunberg et aL (1994), Ruwct(1983), Schenk (1995) or Segond and Breidt (1996) for adiscussion on the degree of ficxibility of idioms and (inthe first two) interesting attempts to connect syntacticflexibility to semantic transparency1389the drastic normalization process that our GB-based parser carries out.3 A sketch  o f  the  t rans la t ion  processIn this section, we will show how idioms arehandled in the French-to-English ITS-2 trans-lation system, a transfer-based translation sys-tem which uses GB-style D-structure represen-tations as interface structures.

Architecture of ITS-2For concreteness, we shall first focus on theepinonymous idiom given in (5):(5)a. Paul a cass~ sa pipe.lit.
'Paul has broken his pipe'b.
Paul kicked the bucket.Translation of (5a) is a three-step rocess:?
Identification of source idiom?
Transfer of idiom?
Generation of target idiom3.1 Id iom identi f icat ionAs we argued in the previous ection, the task ofidentifying an idiom is best accomplished at theabstract level of representation (D-structure).ITS-2 uses the IPS parser (cf.
Wehrli, 1992,1997), which produces the structure (6) for theinput (5a) 5:~In example 6, we use the following syntactic labels :TP  (Tense Phrase) for sentences, VP  for verb phrases,DP  for Determiner Phrases, NP  for Noun Phrases, andPP  for Prepositional Phrases.
(6) \[ Tt' \[ DP Paul\] \[ y a \[ vp cass~ \[ DP sa\[ NP pipe \[ pp e l i \ ] I \ ] \ ]At this point, the structure is completely gen-eral, and does not contain any specification ofidioms.
The idiom recognition procedure is trig-gered by the "head of idiom" lexical feature as-sociated with the head casser.
This feature isassociated with all lexical items which are headsof idioms in the lexical database.The task of the recognition procedure is (i) toretrieve the proper idiom, if any (casser mightbe the head of several idioms), and (ii) to verifythat all the constraints associated with that id-iom are satisfied.
Idioms are listed in the lexicaldatabase as roughly illustrated in (6)6:(7)a. casser sa pipe'to kick the bucket'b.
1: \[ \] 2: \[ casser\] 3: \[ DP Vpipe\]c. 1.
\[+human\]2.
\[-passive\]3.
\[+literal,-extraposit ion\]POSS DPIdiom entries specify (a) the canonical formof the idiom (mostly for reference purposes), (b)the syntactic frame with an ordered list of con-stituents, and (c) the list of constraints associ-ated with each of the constituents.In our (rather simple) example, the lexicalconstraints associated with the idiom (7) statethat the head is a transitive lexeme whose di-rect object has the fixed form "POSS pipe",where POSS stands for a possessive deter-miner coreferential with the external argumentof the head (i.e.
the subject).
Furthermore,the subject constituant bears the feature \[+hu-man\], the head is marked as \[-passive\], mean-ing that this particular idiom cannot be pas-sivized.
Finally, the object is also marked \[?lit-eral, -extraposition\], which means that the di-rect object constituent cannot be modified inany way (not even pluralized), and cannot beextraposed.The structure in (7) satisfies all those con-straints, provided that the possessive sa refers6See Walther & Wehrll (1996) for a discussion of thestructure of the lexical database underlying the ITS-2project1390uniquely to Paul T. It should be noticed thateven though an idiom has been recognized insentence (6), it also has a semantically well-formed literal meaning.
Running ITS-2 in inter-active mode, the user would be asked whetherthe sentence should be taken literaly or as an ex-pression.
In automatic mode, the idiom readingtakes precedence over the literal interpretation s .3.2 Transfer and generat ion  of  id iomsOnce properly identified, an idiom will be trans-fered as any other abstract lexical unit.
Inother words, an entry in our bilingual exiconhas exactly the same form no matter whetherthe correspondance oncerns imple lexemes oridioms.
The corresponding target language lex-eme might be a simple or a complex abstractlexical unit.
For instance, our bilingual exicaldatabase contains, among many others, the fol-lowing correspondances:French Eng l i shavoir besoin de X need Xcasser sa pipe kick the bucketfaire la connaissance de X meet Xavoir envie feel likequelle mouche a piqu~ what has gottenThe generation of target language idioms fol-lows essentially the same pattern as the gener-ation of simple lexemes.
The general patternof generation i  ITS-2 is the following: first, amaximal projection structure (XP) is projectedon the basis of a lexical head and of the lexicalspecification associated with it.
Second, syn-tactic operations apply on the resulting struc-ture (extraposition, passive, etc.)
triggered ei-ther by lexical properties or general featurestransfered from the source sentence.
For in-stance, the lexical feature \[+raising\] associatedwith a predicate would trigger a raising trans-formation (NP movement from the embeddedsubject position to the relevant subject posi-tion).
Subject-Auxiliary inversion, topicaliza-tion, auxiliary verb insertion are all examplesof syntactic transformations triggered by gen-eral features, derived from the source sentence.7Given a proper context, the sentence could be con-strued with sa  referring to some other person, say Bill.8Such a heuristic seems to correspond to normal us-age, which would avoid formulation (Sa) to state that'Paul has broken someone's pipe'.The first step of the generation process pro-duces a target language D-structure, while thesecond step derives S-structure representations.Finally, a morphological component will de-termine the precise orthographical/phonologicalform of each lexical head.In the case of target language idioms, thegeneral pattern applies with few modifications.Step 1 (projection of D-structure) is based onthe lexical representation f the idiom (whichspecifies the complete syntactic pattern of theidiom, as we have pointed out earlier), and pro-duces structure (8a).
Step 2, which only con-cerns the insertion of perfective auxiliary in po-sition T ?, derives the S-structure (8b).
Finally,the morphological component derives sentence(Sc).(8)a.
\[Tp \[DPPaul\] \ [vpkick \[vl~the \[bucket\] \] \] \]b.
\[Tp \[DPPaul\] \ [Thave  \[vpkick \[the \[ bucket\] ] \] \] \]NPc.
Paul has kicked the bucket.NPDP4 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have argued for a distincttreatment of compounds, viewed as complexlexical units of X?-level category, and of idioms,which are phrasal constructs.
While compoundscan be easily processed uring the lexical anal-ysis, idiomatic expressions are best handled ata more abstract level of representation, i  ourcase, the D-structure level produced by theparser.
The task of recognition must be basedon a detailed formal description of each idiom,a lengthy, sometimes tedious but unavoidabletask.
We have then shown that, once prop-erly identified, idioms can be transfered like anyother abstract lexical unit.
Finally, given thefully-specified lexical description of idioms, gen-eration of idiomatic expressions can be achievedwithout ad hoc machinery.5 ReferencesAbeill6, A. and Schabes, Y.
