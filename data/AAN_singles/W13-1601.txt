Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, page 1,Atlanta, Georgia, 14 June 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsRecent adventures with emotion-reading technologyRosalind W. PicardMIT Media Lab, E14-374G75 Amherst St; Cambridge, MA 02139picard@media.mit.edu1 Abstract of the talkThis talk will share stories from recent investiga-tions at the MIT Media Lab in creating technol-ogy to recognize and better communicate emotion.Examples include automating facial affect recogni-tion online for sharing media experiences, gather-ing the worlds largest sets of natural expressions(instead of lab-elicited data) and training machinelearning models to predict liking of the experiencebased on expression dynamics throughout the expe-rience.
We also have found that most people havedifficulty discriminating peak smiles of frustrationfrom peak smiles of delight in static images.
Withmachine learning and dynamic features, we wereable to teach the computer to be highly accurate atdiscriminating these.
These kinds of tools can po-tentially help many people with nonverbal learningdisabilities, limited vision, social phobia, or autismwho find it challenging to read the faces of thosearound them.
I will also share recent findings frompeople wearing physiological sensors 24/7, and howweve been learning about connections between theemotion system, sleep and seizures.
Finally, I willshare some of our newest work related to crowdsourcing cognitive-behavioral therapy and computa-tional empathy, where sentiment analysis could beof huge benefit.1
