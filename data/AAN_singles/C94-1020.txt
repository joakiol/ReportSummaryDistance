MATES/EK is a transfl:r.-ba.~edsystem and it has several subsystems tt, at can be usedto support other MT-developments.
They are gram-.mar developing environment systems, dictionary de-veloping tools, a set of angmented context free gritmInars for English syntactic analysis, and so on.1.

Grammar Writing Language and Its Envi-ronment : MATES/EK runs a series of treetransformations on LSS structures from theEnglish syntactic structure, in order to get astructure specific to Korean syntactic struc-ture.
To do this, a grammar writing languageand the supporting system were developed forthe tree transformations (Kweon, 1992).The whole tree transformations are done ina single grammar processing system in whicha grammar writing language is defined anda set of tools, such as the parser, the in-terpreter and some debugging facilities forthe language, are supported.
In the gram-mar writing language, a rule describes a treetransformation by specifying the p~ttern ofan input tree, test conditions, the transforma-tion operations, and the resultant ree struc-tures.
Figure 2 is an example of a tree trans-formation rule written in grammar writinglanguage and two trees before and after itsapphcation.MATES/EK consists of a set of dictionaries, aset of grammar rules, and the processing modules.Translation is done through a series of processes;English morphological nalysis, English syntac-tic analysis, English semantic analysis, English-Korean lexical transfer, English-to-Korean struc-tural transformation, Korean syntactic structuregeneration, and Korean morphologicM genera-tion.

Engl ish  Syntact i c  Ana lys isIt uses the gener~flized Tomita Lit parsing algo-rithm on augmented context free grammar.
Tilegrammar is inductively constructed from 3,000e~trefully selected sentences that include variouslinguistic phenomena of English.
Those sentencesare mainly selected from the IEEE computer mag-azine September 1991.
Other sources of thetest sentences are HP issue test sentences, ~ndI,ongman English Grammar Textbook.
The con-structed grammar for syntax analysis consists ofabout 500 rules.As described above, LSg(the Lexical SemanticStructure) is description for the intermediate r p-resentation.

Eng l i sh  Semant ic  Ana lys i sWe developed more titan 300 tree transformingrules that are written in grammar writing lawguage.
These grammar rules lead the Englishsyntactic structure into a dependency structure ofEnglish.
This dependency structure is relativelysimilar to meaning structure but it is still speciticto English, so we need more tree transformationsto get a structure for Korean language.head in an \];',uglish dependency structure is a \]:;n-glish verb word, the hexd in corresponding Koreandependency structure is Korean verb or a,djec-live word, those two words are often not mappeddirectly, l"igure 3 is an example of transforma-tion from an English syntactic structure into itsEnglish specilic dependency structures LSS for asentence "Pipelining increases \])erformance by ex-I)loiting instruction-level parallelism."5.
Korean  Generat ion4.
Engl ish to Korean  TransferIn this step the system looks up the English-Korean bilingual dictionary.
We manage the anal-ysis dictionary separately from the transfer dictio-nary so that we may use the san, e analysis dictio-nary to the other language pair such as Fmglishto Japanese with the other transfer dictionary.There are more than 300 lexicat specitic selectionrules developed to make the lexieal selection bet-ter.4.1.
Eng l i sh -Korean  St ructura l  ' lYans-fo rmat ionUsing another tree transformation grammar, theEnglish specific dependency structure is trans-formed into a Korean language specific depen-dency structure after looking up the bilingual dic-tionary.
The dependency structures are repre-sented as head and dependents.
Although the5.1 .

,  1991).
Notethat Korean has, like Japane.se, several alternativepostl)ositions lbr conveying the same meaning.5.2 Korean  Morpho log ica l  Generat ionAfter the whoh: tree transformation, tile resultantstructure is a list of pairs of a morpheme and itscategory.
The morphologicM generator is an au-tomaton that does the synthesis and separatim, ofmorphemes according to the context and Koreanmorpheme combination rule.
Since the Koreanlanguage has some complex morphological struc-ture, the synthesis is a very complex process.131increases performance by / ~ ,~exploiting parallelisms t!!

P rob lems for Evo lut ion of theSystemSince after the first completion of this project, wehave been trying to find and solve the problems ofthis system.
Following list is a brief list of thoseproblems, and they are not seem to be easy tosolve in the near future.Robust processing for ill-formed sentences :Current MATFS/EK  assumes that the inputsentence be a well formed English sentence.After practical test, we found the robustnessfor ill-formed sentences i highly required, be-cause the papers fi'oln the IEEE computermagazine contains the non-sentential, non-text text such as braces, numeric expressions,formulas and so on.Processing of non-continuous idiomatic ex-pressions : In the dictionary entry specifica-tion we have a simple rule to represent henon-continuous idiomatic expressions, but itis not easy to detect those expressions from asentence and represent he found expressionin the internal structure for processing.Selecting correct word correspondency be-tween several alternatives : MATES/EK usesthe semantic marker and a scoring of frequen-cies to select the word correspondeney.
Thesystem still lacks a strong strategy for theword selection.Processing Korean Sentence Style : Ko-reau language has various styles of sen-tences(difference b tween normal ones fromthe honorific or polite expressions), which arequite difficult to catch from the English sen-tences.Too many ambiguities in English syntacticanMysis : Currently MATES/EK uses a set ofad hoc heuristics and lexieal semantic mark-ers coded in the dictionary in order to solvethe ambiguity resolution, such as the PP at-tachment.
This problcm is related to theproblem of selecting the right postposition ofKorean.7.
Test and Evaluat ionEvMuation of an MT systeln enmrges as a criti-c'M issue these days, but we have not yet found astrong and objective way of evaluation.
After thefirst completion of the project we tried though, tomake an evaluation of the system.In order to inake the evaluation as objective aspossible we prepared three factors.
First, the ref-erees of the evaluation should be those who arenot the developers of the system, and they shouldtake a training to make objective decisions.
Weselected randomly five master degree students asthe referees.
Second, the referees are given a deci-sion criteria of four levels: best, good, poor, and732fail.
A sentence is 'best' translated if the resultantKorean sentence is very natural and requires noadditional postediting.
A sentence is 'good' trans-lated if the result sentence is structurally correctbut it has some minor lexicM selection errors.
Asentence is translated 'poor'  if there is structuralerror as well as lexical errors.
By 'fail', we meanwhen the system produces very ill-formed transla-tion or fails to prodnce any result at all.
We tookthe first three levels to be 'success,' because vena sentence is translated in 'poor'  degree, it is stillunderstandable.
(Even if a translation is scoredto be 'fail', it could sometimes be understand-able from the view point of 'mechanical transla-tion.')
Third, the test sentences hould be thosesentences which were never used during the de-velopment time.This system was tested on 1,708 sentences,whose length were less than 26 words selectedfrom 2500 sentences in the IEEE comtmter mag-azine September 1991 issue.
It showed about 95percent of success rate for sentences horter than15 words, about 90 percent for 18 words, 80 per-cent for 21 words, and 75 percent for 26 words.This is a quite encouraging result since the IEEEcomputer magazine contains wide range of textsof wrions styles.8.
Conclusion and Further StudyDevelopment of MATES/EK gaw; a strong mo-tivation of attacking practically important prob-lems, such as dictionary management, scaling upthe grammar ules to the real texts, controllingthe consistency of a large system.The system MATES/EK is still under grow-ing, trying to overcmne the problems listed above,scaling up the dictionaries and the grammar ules,and doing downsizing to the PC environment.l~eferences\[1\] Choi, K.S., (1988).
