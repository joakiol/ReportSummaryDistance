We present an automated approach that is based on the hypothesis that if twosentences are a) found in the same cluster of news articles and b) contain temporal expressionsthat reference the same point in time, they are likely to refer to the same event.
This allowsus to group similar sentences together and apply open-domain Information Extraction (OpenIE)methods to extract lists of textual references for each detected event.
We outline our proposedapproach and present a preliminary evaluation in which we extract events and references from 20clusters of online news.
Our experiments indicate that for the largest part our hypothesis holdstrue, pointing to a strong potential for applying our approach to building an event repository.
Weillustrate cases in which our hypothesis fails and discuss ways for addressing sources or errors.1 IntroductionWe present ongoing work in the automatic creation of a repository of events and event references fromclusters of online news articles.
In the context of this work, an event is something that happens at onespecific point in time that can be referenced in text with different text surface forms.
An example ofthis may be the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook, which has a specific timestamp (02-19-2014),as well as a number of different textual references (such as ?the acquisition of WhatsApp?, ?Facebook?slandmark deal?
etc).
Unlike previous work in event extraction (Aone and Ramos-Santacruz, 2000; Ji andGrishman, 2008), we are less interested in filling slots in a fixed set of event templates.
Rather, we aimto identify an unrestricted set of events (Ritter et al., 2012) and all their possible event mentions.
Thismeans that even noun phrases (?the much-discussed takeover?)
and incomplete mentions (?Zuckerberg?s19 billion bet?)
are valid textual references we wish to capture.We give examples of such events in Table 1.
We believe that automatically distilling such eventsfrom news text and hosting them in an event repository could provide a valuable resource to gain acomprehensive overview of world events and also serve as a resource for event-linking efforts in futureInformation Extraction (IE) research.In this paper, we propose a method for automatically creating such an event repository.
Our methodleverages computer-generated news sites that aggregate articles from news sources worldwide and groupsimilar stories into news clusters.
Such news clusters represent an intriguing reservoir for event extrac-tion: Each cluster typically represents one news item that is reported on by hundreds of different onlinesources.
Articles in a cluster will therefore describe similar information content - and reference the sameevents - using different words.
On these news articles, we apply temporal expression taggers to identifyand normalize textual references to specific points in time.Our main hypothesis is that if two sentences are a) found in the same cluster of news articles and b)contain temporal expressions that reference the same point in time, they are likely to refer to the sameevent.
This allows us to group similar sentences together and for each referenced point in time extract anevent with a list of different textual references.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Each extracted event consists of an ID, a timestampwhich indicates on which date the event took place, a short human-readable event representation, and alist of strings that may be used to reference this event.In this paper, we present our event extraction system and conduct a preliminary evaluation in order todetermine in how far our hypothesis holds.
We discuss the evaluation results and possible improvementsand give an outline of current and future work.2 Event and Reference Extraction2.1 Method OverviewDetermine sentences likely to reference the same event.
We begin the event extraction process bycrawling Google News1to retrieve clusters of English language news articles and their publishing date.Each news article is then boilerplated and segmented into sentences.We then make use of temporal expression taggers (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2010; Chang and Manning, 2012)to recognize temporal expressions in text and normalize them into machine-readable timestamps.
Thiscauses expressions such as ?last Friday?, ?winter of 2013?, and ?Saturday morning?
to be normalizedto the timestamps ?2013-10-10?, ?2013-WI?, and ?2012-09-24TMO?
respectively by using the article?spublishing date as a reference point.
We identify all sentences with temporal expressions and groupsentences together that a) contain the same timestamp and b) are found in the same cluster of documents.Refer to Table 2 for examples of sentences grouped according to these criteria.Determine Open-Domain Facts.
Because sentences may refer to multiple events2, we use OpenIEmethods (Schmitz et al., 2012; Choi, 2012) to determine for each sentence a list of N-ary facts.
Eachfact consist of a predicate and a number of arguments.
We then discard all facts that do not containthe temporal expression in order to keep only those facts expressed within each sentence to which thetemporal expression refers.
This gives us a list of N-ary facts which we presume to refer to the sameevent, together with its timestamp.Determine Event Representative and Store.
For human readability purposes, we then identify a rep-resentative of the grouped N-ary facts by determining the most common predicate and head arguments.We assign a global ID to each event and store it along with its timestamp, its representative and a list ofall textual references and their frequency counts in a database.2.2 Granularity of TimestampsOne question at the onset of this work was which granularity of temporal expressions would be required.We manually inspected a sample of news clusters and noted that news articles rarely provide time in-formation that is accurate to the minute.
Rather, most temporal expressions refer to specific dates inpast, present or future.
We therefore choose the unit ?day?
as granularity for the temporal expressions inthis work.
We dismiss all expressions that refer to larger and more vague periods of time (?last winter?,1http://news.google.com/2An example of this is the sentence: ?When asked, he said that WhatApp accepted Facebook?s offer last Sunday?.
Here, thetemporal expression ?last Sunday?
refers only the ?WhatApp accepted Facebook?s offer?
part of the sentence, not the date theperson was asked.15TIMESTAMP SENTENCES2014-02-20 Facebook inked a deal late Wednesday to buy popular texting service WhatsApp.Yesterday , Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg bought their five-year-old company.Thursday , 20 February 2014 Facebook Inc will buy fast-growing mobile-messaging startup WhatsApp.Facebook Inc. agreed to buy mobile messaging-service WhatsApp today for as much as 19 billion.2014-02-01 The European Space Agency received the all-clear message from its Rosetta spacecraft at 7:18 p.m.[..] a comet-chasing spacecraft sent its first signal back to Earth on MondayESA received the all-clear message Hello World from its Rosetta spacecraft [..] away shortly after 7 pm.Yesterday?s message from the Rosetta spacecraft was celebrated by scientists [..]2014-02-07 Indonesia?s Mount Sinabung volcano erupted and killed at least 11 people [..] on SaturdayBut a day later , Sinabung spewed hot rocks and ash up to 2km in the air.A giant cloud of hot volcanic ash clouds engulfs villages [..] in Sumatra island on February 1, 2014.An Indonesian volcano that has been rumbling for months unleashed a major eruption Saturday.Table 2: Examples of sentences grouped by cluster and timestamp.
The temporal expression taggersenable us to group sentences that refer to the same point of time in very different ways (highlightedbold).
As can be seen in the examples, sentences grouped according to these criteria generally refer tothe same event, albeit in sometimes widely varying words.
?throughout the year?)
and generalize all temporal information that refer to the time of day (?later today?,?at 7:18 p.m.?
).2.3 Improving Event QualityUpon manual inspection of identified events we find that our hypothesis fails in some cases: A newsitem may often summarize a number of smaller events that happened within the same day.
An exampleof this are news items that deal with unrest in war-torn countries that may reference several bombings,terrorist attacks and other violence that happened across the country on the day the article was published.Another example are sports articles that refer to several sport matches that take place during the sameday.
This is problematic, as in such cases we erroneously link non-synonymous textual references to thesame event.
We experiment with two methods for reducing this error:Time Window Filter As indicated above, we note that our hypothesis most often fails for events thatoccur within 2 days of the publishing date of the articles in the news cluster.
Accordingly, weexperiment with filtering out such events, leaving only events to be extracted that lie in the moredistant past or future (such as past or upcoming election days, significant events that impact thecurrent news story).
However, since the largest part of events that are reported on in online newstake place within this 2-day time window, we risk significant recall-loss by discarding too manyevents.Word Alignment Condition For this reason, we investigate requirements for facts to be grouped to-gether in addition to the requirement of sharing the same timestamp.
We experiment with mono-lingual word-alignment tools (Yao et al., 2013) to determine the ?similarity?
of two facts as thenumber of aligned content words.
We then require at least one content word to be shared by twofacts in order for them to be grouped together into an event.3 Preliminary EvaluationWe conduct a preliminary evaluation to determine to which extend our hypothesis holds.
To this end,we use our method to extract events from a sample of 20 news clusters with an average size of 200news articles.
We evaluate our method in four setups: 1) The baseline setup in which we apply only the?same cluster + same timestamp = same event?
hypothesis (?BASE?).
2) The baseline setup plus thetime window filter (?TIME?).
3) The baseline setup plus the word alignment condition (?ALIGN?).
4)The baseline setup plus both the time window filter and the word alignment condition (?ALL?
).We manually evaluate each event found with our method by checking whether all references indeedrefer to the same event.
We calculate a purity value that indicates the proportion of the biggest group16METHOD TOTAL EVENT REFERENCES CORRECT EVENT REFERENCES PRECISION PURITYBASE 609 511 0.839 0.698TIME 109 88 0.807 0.699ALIGN 609 526 0.864 0.793ALL 109 89 0.817 0.728Table 3: The results of our manual evaluation of extracted events and their event references.
The mainhypothesis that events mentioned with the same date in one cluster delivers quite promising results with84% precision.
The time window filter does not seem to contribute significant gains, while the ALIGNfilter does boost both precision and purity.of references that refer to the same event over all references in an event cluster.
This means that if allreferences indeed refer to the same event, its purity is 1.0.
Table 3 lists the average purity over all events.When a reference accurately represents both the content and the date contained in the original newssentence and the real world event mentioned actually occurred on this date, we labeled it as a ?correct?event reference.
The precision listed in Table 3 reflects the proportion of correct events references vs. allextracted event reference in the evaluation data set.
This measure indicates how well the extraction itselfperforms, apart from the clustering of event references.Hypothesis produces promising results with a precision of 0.84.
In general, we find our underlyingassumption to indeed be a good basis for event extraction.
Our baseline approach based on only thishypothesis produces promising results with a precision of 0.84, albeit at somewhat low overall purity.Wrong resolution of relative time references biggest source of error.
When inspecting sources of er-rors more closely, we note that the approach fails most often because of erroneous resolution of relativetime references such as ?yesterday?, ?past Saturday?
or ?this Sunday?.
This may happen because thewrong publishing date is assigned to a crawled news article, causing temporal taggers to use a wrongreference point for relative time expressions.
With relative references to weekdays, the taggers are oftenunsure whether the past or present week is referenced.
Consider the expression ?on Saturday?
in thesentence ?John Kerry will meet with opposition leaders on Saturday?.
Although the coming Saturday ismeant in this context, the temporal expression tagger normalizes the date to the last Saturday before thepublishing date.
We believe that such systematic errors can be addressed in future work through assign-ing higher confidence to explicit temporal expressions mentions and resolving ambiguities in relativeexpressions using this information.Time Window Filter provides no significant contribution.
Contrary to initial assumption filtering outevents within a 2-day time window does not actually boost precision, but rather greatly reduces the totalnumber of extracted events at slightly lower precision and purity.
The likely reason for this behavior isthe above noted most common error source is not addressed by this filter.Word Alignment Condition boosts both precision and purity significantly.
The word alignmentcondition on the other hand greatly increases both precision and purity.
While the increase in purity isto be expected as different events occurring on the same date are indeed split into separate clusters, theincrease in precision comes as somewhat of a surprise.
Closer inspection of the results revealed thatthe word alignment approach aggressively groups similar event mentions, considering also synonyms asmatches, therefore not resulting in redundant event detections as initially feared.
Based on these results,we believe that experimentation with word alignment conditions may further increase event detectionquality.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we have proposed to create a repository of events and their textural references and presentedan approach to accomplish this automatically by leveraging news clusters and temporal expressions.
Ourapproach is based on the hypothesis that sentences that are found in the same news cluster and refer tothe same point in time also refer to the same events.
We described the implementation of a prototypesystem and conducted a preliminary manual evaluation on 20 news clusters to investigate our hypothesis.Our findings generally point to a strong potential of automatically mining events and references from17news clusters.
While our hypothesis fails in some cases, our analysis indicates that incorporating mono-lingual word-alignment techniques can greatly improve extraction quality and appears to be a powerfultool to disambiguate events that share both timestamp and news cluster.Present work focuses on further exploring the potential of word alignment as well as the use of cluster-wide statistics to correct labeling mistakes such as the ones observed for temporal tagging.
We aim touse the system on very large amounts of news clusters crawled from the Web to generate - and makepublicly available - the resource that we have proposed in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThe research is funded by the European Union (EU) under grant no.
