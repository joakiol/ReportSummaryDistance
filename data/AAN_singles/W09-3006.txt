We in-troduce the project and describe some ofthe issues that were important in anno-tating three subordinators, namely kars?
?n,rag?men and halde, all of which encode thecoherence relation Contrast-Concession.We also describe the annotation tool.1 IntroductionThe Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a projectinitiated by the joint effort of a group of re-searchers in Turkey.
The project builds on an ex-isting corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus(MTC) (Say et al, 2002), and extends it to a dis-course level resource by following the principlesof the PDTB (Prasad et al, 2007) in annotatingdiscourse connectives and their arguments.
The 2-million-word MTC contains 520 continuous textsfrom various genres written between 1991-2000.From a semantic perspective, we take discourseconnectives as predicates that take as their argu-ments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract ob-ject interpretations.
Abstract objects are proposi-tions, facts, events, situations, etc.
(Asher, 1993).Connectives themselves may be realized explicitlyor implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al, 2007).Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexi-cal items that encode a discourse relation, whileimplicit connectives can be inferred from relatedtext spans that have coherence relations.
The TDBproject aims to annotate explicit connectives only.In Turkish, discourse connectives are identifiedwith three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Web-ber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric0Corresponding author: dezeyrek@metu.edu.trconnectives).
All these discourse connectives havetwo and only two arguments, which are conve-niently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 isalways the argument that syntactically hosts theconnective.The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourseconnectives is consistent with the following ob-servations in discourse: Sentences in discourseare coherently related, and therefore when ex-plicit discourse connectives are used, if they arereally discourse connectives, they are bound toset up a relation between a consequent clause andits antecedent.
(Note that the ARG2 designationdoes not imply that ARG2 is consequent or an-tecedent.)
In certain cases presupposition needs amediator, viz.
the discourse connective.
Noncon-nectival discourse relations are certainly possible,but connective-engendered discourse relations areclaimed to be more specific about their semantics,e.g.
they bring about presuppositional meaning(van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al, 1999).In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification isunlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lex-ical property of functors (e.g.
verbs) which arenot necessarily presuppositional and hence theycan differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive,unergative, unaccusative etc.
).2 The DataThe MTC is preprocessed to obtain the raw textskeeping the title, author, publishing date and thetext type information at the beginning of each file.Stand-off annotation is done on the textual render-ing of the MTC.To enable the data to be viewable universallywithout losing any character information, the fileformat (originally xcs) was converted to text, andthe character encoding (originally Turkish-ISO-1Whether or not discourse connectives in any languagetake more than two arguments is an open question that needsto be established in further research.44Text type File Count % S1 % S2 % S3 % S4 %Novel 123 15.63% 31 15.74% 30 15.23% 31 15.82% 31 15.74%Short story 114 14.49% 28 14.21% 29 14.72% 28 14.29% 29 14.72%Research/Monograph 49 6.23% 13 6.60% 12 6.09% 12 6.12% 12 6.09%Article 38 4.83% 9 4.57% 10 5.08% 9 4.59% 10 5.08%Travel 19 2.41% 5 2.54% 5 2.54% 4 2.04% 5 2.54%Interview 7 0.89% 2 1.02% 2 1.02% 2 1.02% 1 0.51%Memoir 18 2.29% 4 2.03% 5 2.54% 5 2.55% 4 2.03%News 419 53.24% 105 53.30% 104 52.79% 105 53.57% 105 53.30%TOTAL 787 197 197 196 197Table 1: File count and percentage information according to text type for the preprocessed MTC and itssubcorpora.

Finally, theprocessed MTC data were divided into four sub-corpora by keeping the text type distribution, filecount and word count as equal as possible in eachsubcorpus.
The text type distribution, file countand word percentage information in each subcor-pus are given in Table 1.
In the project, we plan toannotate subcorpus 1.3 Subordinating Conjunctions inTurkish: A Brief OverviewSubordinators have two subtypes.
Converbs aresuffixes attached directly to verb roots.
For exam-ple, the suffix -(y)ArAk ?by (means of)?
requiresas its ARG2 a nominalized adverbial clause as in(1).
Complex subordinators, e.g.
rag?men ?despite,although?, kars?
?n ?although?, halde ?despite, alongwith?, ic?in causal ?since?, purposive ?so as to?, etc.mostly take case-marked nominalized clauses astheir ARG2.
(1) Hu?ku?met ... uyum paketini onaylayarak ...Erdog?an?n o?nu?ndeki engellerden birini kald?rd?.By approving the adaptation package ..., thegovernment alleviated one of the obstacles forErdog?an ...In this paper, we will not deal with converbs.We will also not deal with connectives taking astheir ARG2 a finite clause because none of thesesubtypes have been annotated yet.
We will focuson three postpositions taking a nominalized clauseas ARG2, namely rag?men, kars?
?n and halde, all ofwhich encode the Contrast-Concession relation.In the PDTB, such clauses were not annotated asarguments.
However, in Turkish, they are so com-mon as arguments of subordinators that we wouldhave missed an important property of Turkish dis-course if we did not annotate them.
In the restof the paper, we provide examples taken from theMTC.
We underline the connective, show ARG2in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics.3.1 The minimality principleAs in the PDTB, the minimality principle is in-voked, according to which clauses, parts of clausesor sentences that are minimally necessary and suf-ficient for the discourse relation engendered bythe connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2(Prasad et al, 2007).
Any other text span thatis perceived to be important for the interpretationof the discourse relation can be selected as sup-plementary information in addition to ARG1 orARG2.3.2 Morphological properties of thearguments and their relative orderingIn Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentiallynominalizations, which may be formed by -DIKor -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the actionnominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).Two of the connectives, i.e.
rag?men and kars?
?nexpect action nominals, the person agreement suf-fix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2.
Onthe other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-tive nominal and the person agreement suffix.
Inthe examples below, we show these suffixes withglosses on the English translations.The arguments of subordinators are necessarilyadjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 or-der because Turkish is a left-branching languageand subordinate clauses are on the left in canonicalorder.
ARG2 can be postposed for backgroundingpurposes or to express new and unexpected infor-mation, as in (2).
(2) ... ayn?
annesine oldu]ugu gibi ona da, kimseyeba/uglanmayanlar kolayca bag?lan?yordu; u?stelik oo?yle bir bag?
?ml?l?k talep etmedig?i halde.... just as it happened to her mother, people whocan?t easily commit themselves to anyone would45easily commit themselves to her, although shewould not ask-FACTN-AGR for such a commit-ment.3.3 Issues in annotating the argumentsOne of the challenges we have faced so far is thequestion of how to annotate connectives which arethemselves a converb suffix (e.g.
-(y)ArAk, as in(1)) or postpositions that choose a case-markedARG2 as in (2).
In both cases, we decided to an-notate ARG2 by selecting the clause without sepa-rating the suffixes.
In this way, we would not inter-fere with the annotators?
intuitions since we wouldnot be demanding them to have conscious knowl-edge of the morphological constraints on the ar-guments.
This style of annotation was welcomedby the annotators.
When all the annotations arecompleted, we plan to separate the suffixes with amorphological parser to provide a full view of themorphology of the arguments.Another issue was how to annotate shared sub-jects in subordinate clauses.
Turkish allows sub-ject pro-drop and in complex sentences, the sharedsubject is shown by the person agreement suffixon the verb of the consequent clause.
To capturethis fact, we chose to exclude shared subjects fromthe annotation of the arguments.
This style ofannotation conforms to the minimality principle.As illustrated in (3), the subject, Neriman, whichappears in its canonical clause-initial position inARG2 is not selected because the verb of the sub-sequent clause carries the person agreement suffix.
(3) Neriman yatak odas?nda sigara ic?ilmesini is-temedig?i halde s?imdilik sigaraya ses c?
?karm?yor.Although Neriman does not want-FACTN-AGRpeople to smoke in her bedroom, (she) doesn?tsay-AGR anything for the moment.2If the subject is not shared, it is included in theannotation, even if it causes discontinuity.
As itis illustrated in (4), ARG2 intervenes in ARG1 byseparating it from its subject.
(4) Rukiye, kendisinden u?c?
yas?
ufak olmas?narag?men, erkek kardes?ini kendi og?lu san?yordu, ...Rukiye, although (he) is-ACTN-AGR-DAT threeyears younger than herself, thought-AGR that herbrother was her son...2The pronoun is in parentheses to reflect pro-drop.
Thefollowing abbreviations are used on the translations to showthe morphological characteristics of the clauses: ACTN: Ac-tion nominal, FACTN: Factive nominal, AGR: Person agree-ment suffix, DAT: Dative case, ABL: Ablative case.
NOM:Nominative case.Example (5) shows that two nominalizedclauses can be selected as the arguments of thesubordinator kars?
?n leaving out the shared sub-ject.
In this example, the subject is shown betweensquare brackets for clarity.
Note that, ARG1 isalso a nominalized clause since it is embedded un-der the attribution verb so?yle - ?say?.3(5) ... [herkes yarat?lan toplumsal deg?erden verdig?iemek oran?nda pay alacak bic?imindeki sosyalistiktisat ilkesinin] asl?nda c?ok es?itlikc?i gibigo?zu?kmesine kars?
?n es?itsizlig?i engelleye-meyeceg?ini, ... so?yler... says that ... despite (it) looks-ACTN-AGR-DAT quite egalitarian, [the socialist principle,stating that everyone gets a share proportional tohis labor] will not prevent-ACTN-AGR inequality...Finally, in annotating adjuncts, we follow thesame principle we followed in annotating sharedsubjects.
For instance in (6), the adjunct yemekte?at dinner?
is not annotated since it is shared by thearguments of the connective rag?men.
(6) Gu?l de yemekte kilo ald?rmas?na rag?men S?amtatl?lar?ndan c?ok hos?land?g??n?
ifade etti.At dinner, Gu?l-NOM, also said that although(theyi) are-ACTN-AGR-DAT fattening, (he)likes Damascus deserts-ABLi very much.4 The Annotation ProcessBefore the annotation procedure started, a set ofannotation guidelines were prepared.
The guide-lines include the basic principles, such as whatdiscourse connectives are, where in the discourseone can find ARG1 and ARG2, how to annotateshared subjects, adjuncts, etc.
Rather than beingstrict rules, the guidelines are aimed at being gen-eral principles guiding the annotators in their de-cision of selecting the text span that is minimallysufficient for interpreting the discourse relation en-coded by the connective.The annotation cycle consisted of 1) annotat-ing a connective by at least three different people2) measuring the agreement among them with theinter-anotator agreement tool 3) resolving the dis-agreements with an anonymous decision.4.1 The annotation toolWe have an XML-based infrastructure for annota-tion.
It aims to produce searchable and trackabledata.
Stand-off annotation has well-known advan-tages such as the ability to see layers separately, or3In the PDTB, attribution is not taken as a discourse re-lation but it is annotated.

>0.05.The first column shows the overall agreement among the three annotators.
Other columns show the agreement of one annotatorwith the agreed/gold standard annotations.
For halde, 2 annotators performed a common annotation (given as Annotator1) anda third annotator annotated it separately (given as Annotator2).to distribute annotation without data due to licens-ing constraints.
To this list we can add the em-pirical necessity that, the crossing links in a singlelayer of same kind of annotation might not be easyto do inline.
They can be done inline using SGMLOCCURS checks, but they are easier to annotatein stand-off mode.The tool has a regular expression mode in whichthe annotator can use his/her knowledge of Turk-ish word structure to collect similarly inflectedwords without morphological analysis.
For exam-ple, -ArAk$, in which the uppercase forms repre-sent metaphonemes, will bring words ending withthe allomorphs of the converb suffix due to vowelharmony: erek, arak etc.5 ConclusionThe TDB project is a first attempt in creating anannotated resource for written Turkish discourse.The annotation process is still continuing.
In thispaper, the emphasis was on a small number of con-nectives, namely three postpositions, which form asubclass of subordinators.
The paper described therole of certain morpho-syntactic facts in interpret-ing the coherence relation between two clauses,and how these facts were reflected in the annota-tions.Three subjects separately annotated each of thesubordinators on the annotation tool, and inter-rater reliability was calculated.
The statistics wereobtained from Cochran?s Q test to the ARG1 andARG2 spans.
The annotation data were encodedwith 1 if the character is in the span and 0 if itis not.
The encoded data were put to the Q test.All the results were above the minimum successprobability (>0.05), showing that the annotationswere consistent (see Table 2).
We will run anotherCochran experiment in which we will test whetherthe annotators agree on ARG1/ARG2 boundaries,rather than just word inclusion in the text spans asabove.Given the distribution of agreements, Cochranprovides the number of subjects who must agreeso that a text span can be reliably considered anARG1 or ARG2.
This we believe is important toreport with the final product (to be made publicsoon), so that its gold standard can be assessed bythe community.AcknowledgmentsWe thank TUBITAK for financial support.
