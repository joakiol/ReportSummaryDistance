The current paper draws onthis linguistic research to organize an adverbiallexicon which will be useful for informationretrieval and natural language processingsystems.1.
INTRODUCTIONthe semantic and syntactic properties of thesedifferent classes of adverbs.In this study, we give some indication ofhow a sophisticated and well structuredadverbial exicon can help NLP systems tohandle adverbs.
Our lexicon builds on thework of several linguists.
Their work hashelped us to organize information about adverbsfrom the Collins English Dictionary (CED) andother sources.
The adverbial lexicon isorganized using the Oracle Relational DatabaseManagement System.There have been many studies on nouns,verbs, and adjectives in NLP systems.
Adverbshave received far less attention.It is very difficult for natural languageprocessing (NLP) systems to handle adverbsbecause of the large number of syntactic rolesthat adverbs can assume in sentences.
Adverbscan modify verbs, adjectives, adverbs, clauses,or the whole sentences.
Adverbs obeycomplicated positional and selectionalrestrictions.
Many adverbs change meaningswhen they change their positions in sentences.Despite this complexity, linguists have madesignificant progress developing a comprehensiveset of adverbs classifications, and elucidating* This research was partially supported by theNational Science Foundation under grant IRI-8704619.

Finally,Section 5 concludes.2.
SEMANTIC CLASSIFICATION OFADVERBS AND SELECTIONALRESTRICTIONS.With minor variations, Jacobson \[1964\]and Quirk et al \[1985, p438-74\] classifyadverbs semantically as: adverbs of time,manner, degree, location, direction, transitionand hedges.
Adverbs of time, for example,answer questions such as "When?," "Howoften?," "How long?."
Some examples ofadverbs in this class are "before," "during,""now," "forever," seldom," etc.
Adverbs ofmanner answer questions like "How?"
and "Inwhat manner (way)?"
Examples are "quickly,"AcrEs DE COLING..92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 1 i 9 2 PROC.

1992"like," "together," and "without."
Hedgesindicate fuzzy restrictions such as "essentially,""sort of," and "virtually" \[Lakoff, 1972\].We have classified adverbs bysystematically analyzing CED definitions.More details on this process can be found inConlon et al, \[1990\] and Pin-Ngern \[1990\].These semantic classes are stored in ouradverbial lexicon as in Table 1.AD V_ CED (_W__QR~ ,H / G #, E~_I~S__F~,8UBSENSE#,SEMANTIC CLASS)about 1 2 l DEGREE, TIMEactually 1 1 1 MOODbetween 1 2 2 PLACE, DIRECTIONdown 1 2 7 POSITIONevidently 1 1 1 MOODTable 1.
Adverb classification from CEDThe first line indicates that in CED, theadverb "about" with homograph number 1,sense number 2, and subsense number 1belongs to the flggr~ and time class.
(Tofacilitate xposition, the tables here and beloware not normalized.
)Huang \[1975\] provides a similarclassification of adverbs based on semanticusage with verbs.
These classes of adverbsinclude:State of ~ ~ .
Adverbs in thisgroup indicate a participant's state of mind.Examples are ~ and ~ in thefollowing sentences:He rf_aLf.Ra~ stepped into the room.Mary was F_JllLegl2 taken advantage of...vA.d.x.cz~.
These adverbsexpress an evaluation of the actor'sparticipation i the event such as "clumsily" in"He clumsily stepped on the snail.
"of \]~5.UR.
These describeaspects of the result of an event such as theadverb "correctly" in the sentence "He spelledthe words correctly.
"Huang's classifications can also beincorporated into Table 1.These adverb classifications can beextremely useful to NIP systems, in particular,in the statement of selectional restrictions (orpreferences).
Huang describes a number ofselectional restrictions between adverbs andother parts of speech.
Some examples are:Adverbs of manner or direction can modifyverbs of motion.Adverbs of result are proper toaccomplishment and achievement verbs.Time and locative adverbs usually occur inaction sentences and specify the temporal andspatial circumstances of the events.Degree adverbs express the degree or extentof a certain quality or state and presuppose ananalysis of grading properties in the semanticsof adjectives in particular.Conjunctive adverbs are used in almost hesame way as conjunctions.This type of information should helptext generation systems to select appropriatetypes of adverb to suit nouns, verbs, adjective,and adverbs which have already been chosen.It may also be useful for resolution ofambiguity in natural anguage understandingapplications ( ee Radford \[1988, p372\] for anexample of a sentence in which selectionalrestrictions resolve ambiguity).
Informationabout selectional restriction are stored as inTable 2.ACTES I)E COLING-92, NAN'rE.S, 23-28 AO~" 1992 1 1 9 3 PROC.

Selectional Restrictions for Adverbof MannerFrom the above examples, "clumsily"and "slowly" can modify dynamic verbs andaction sentences.3.
FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONAND THE SYNTACTIC BEHAVIOR OFADVERBSJacobson \[1964\] groups adverbs intofour major functional classes: modifyingadverbs ("L.I/?...~ he is ~ careful"),complementary adverbs ("Please come ~') ,referential dverbs (" This section, in particular,is important"), and conjunctive adverbs ("Hewill not leave unless he asks him to").Adverbs that function as modifiers, inturn, can modify verbs ("He spelledr,~_rLeC~"),adjectives ('They are ~ tall"), other adverbs("He works ~ well"), or even clausesand the whole sentences ("ForCunat?ly he wasnot drunk").These functional c asses help to organizeknowledge representation schemes involvingadverbs, and are also essential forunderstanding the syntactic properties ofadverbs.
Jackendoff, for example, classifiesadverbs as subject-oriented, speaker-oriented(sentence), and manner adverbs, and representsthe meaning structures of these adverbs inessentially prolog form as follows:Adverb class: SentenceProlog-like formula: ADJ(f(Np1,...,NPa))Example: EVIDENT(WALKED(JOHN,IN))It is evident hat John walked in.Evidently, John walked in.Adverb class: Subject-orientedProlog-like formula: ADJ(Npi, f(NP 1 ..... NPa))Example: CLUMSY(FRED,DROPPED(FRED,THE BOOK))It was clumsy of Fred to drop the book.Clumsily, Fred dropped the book.Adverb class: MannerProlog-like formula: \[f/ADV\](Np1,...,NP n)Example: \[RAN/QUICKLY\] (SUE,HOME)Sue quickly ran home.Figure 1.Huang uses similar prolog-like formulas torepresent the semantic structure of adverbs.This same functional classification alsoallows Jackendoff to derive positions of adverbsby using parse trees.
According to Jackendoff,sentence adverbs must be attached to an S-node, while manner adverbs are attached to VPnodes.
Thus the sentence adverb "evidently"can appear in positions uch as the following:SADV NP VPAV PPEvidently John walked in the store.Figure 2.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 not~W 1992 I 1 9 4 PROC.

John evl ent yFigure 3.A similar parse tree could be constructed for"John walked in the store, evidently."
On theother hand, the sentence *'John walkedevidently in the store," is impossible becausethe parse tree does not allow "evidently" to beattached to the S node (see figure 4.
)NP ~ VPV ADV PP*John walked evid fly to the storeFigure 4.For a similar discussion, see McCawley\[1988, p631=40\] and Radford \[1988, p73, 93\].Classification of adverbs by functional classis gwen in tables such as Table 3.ADV_MOD W(_WQ_~_,H_H_LC.~,SENS~,SUBSENSE#,MODIFYING_CLASS)evidently 1 1 1 sentencehappily 1 1 1 sentence, speaker, mannerclumsily 1 1 1 subject, mannerTable 3.
Classifications of ModifyingAdverb Based on Modification ClassAdditional information about adverbialpositions in sentences has been collected byJacobson \[1964\].
This information shouldsupplement the information in Table 3, andshould also be helpful for information retrievaland NLP applications.
This information isorganized as in Table 4.ADV- JACOBSON(~_ ,H/G#,SENS~,SUBSENSE#,POSITION)after 1 2 1 E4constantly 1 1 1 M1, M3, M4, El, E5exactly 1 1 2 M3, M4otherwise 1 2 1 M3, El, E4, E5Table 4.
Adverb Positions in SentencesCollected by JaeobsonThus, "constantly" is found in "middle" and"end" positions.
More details about eachposition can be found in Jacobson \[1964\].4.
APPLICATIONSA sophisticated a verbial lexicon should helpNLP systems to handle adverbs appropriately.NLP systems will be able to use information inthe adverbial lexicon in parsing, languageunderstanding, and text generation systems.Suppose, for example, that a parser has toparse a sentence of the form: "John \[Adv\]walked to the store."
The parser can determinehow to treat the adverb by looking in thelexicon to see whether the adverb is a sentenceor a verb phrase adverb.
For example, if"quickly" is the adverb in the sentence, it is amanner adverb, so it should be attached to theverb or verb phrase node.
On the other hand,if the adverb is "evidently" then it is a moodadverb (speaker oriented sentence modifier),and so, should be attached to the S node.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANll~S, 23-28 AO~' 1992 1 1 9 5 t'ROC.
O1: COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992Once the sentence has been successfullyparsed, the language understanding system canthen create prolog-like formulas of the formindicated in Figure 1.
Similarly, the textgeneration system should be designed to takeprolog-like formulas uch as those in Figure 1and successfully translate them into naturallanguage.
The functional class then placesrestrictions on the position of the adverbs, as inFigures 2, 3, and 4.Finally, selectional restrictions can be usedto reduce lexical ambiguity in languageunderstanding systems, and assist in wordchoice in text generation (see Section 2).5.
CONCLUSIONNLP systems can handle adverbs, if theadverbial exicon provides enough relevantinformation with appropriate knowledgerepresentation techniques.
The tables in ourlexicon include, among others,Table 1: Semantic classifications of eachadverb.Table 2: Selectional restrictions.Table 3: Modifying class (sentence, speaker,manner, etc.
).Table 4.
Jacobson's dictionary of adverbplacement.This adverbial exicon can be used incombination with Tables for other parts ofspeech to implement NLP systems.These tables, with others, should allow NLPsystems to break down the intimidatingcomplexity of the adverb class, and so, handleparsing of sentences with adverbs, adverbplacement, knowledge representation related toadverbs, and selectional restrictions betweenadverbs and other parts of speech.6.
