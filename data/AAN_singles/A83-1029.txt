COMPUTER-ASSISTED TRANSLATION SYSTEMS:The Standard Design and A Multi-level DesignAlan K. MelbyLinguistics DepartmentBrigham Young UniversityProvo, Utah 84602 USAABSTRACTThe standard design for a computer-assistedtranslation system consists of data entry of sourcetext, machine translation, and revision of rawmachine translation.
This paper discusses thisstandard design and presents an alternative multi-level design consisting of integrated word process-ing, terminology aids, preprocessing aids and alink to an off- l ine machine translation system.Advantages of the new design are discussed.I THE STANDARD DESIGN FOR A COMPUTER-ASSISTED TRANSLATION SYSTEM.The standard design for a computer-assistedtranslation system consists of three phases:(A) data entry of the source text, (B) machinetranslation of the text, and (C) human revision ofthe raw machine translation.
Most machine trans-lation projects of the past thirty years have usedthis design without questioning its validity, yeti t  may not be optimal.
This section wil l  discussthis design and some possible objections to i t .The data entry phase may be tr iv ia l  i f  thesource text is available in machine-readable formalready or can be optically scanned, or i t  mayinvolve considerable overhead i f  the text must beentered on a keyboard and proofread.The actual machine translation is usuallyof the whole text.
That is, the system is general-ly designed to produce some output for each sen-tence of the source text.
Of course, some sen-tences wil l  not receive a ful l  analysis and sothere wil l  be a considerable variation in thequality of the output from sentence to sentence.Also, there may be several possible translationsfor a given word within the same gramatical cate-gory and subject matter so that the system mustchoose one of the translations arbitrari ly.
Thatchoice may of course be appropriate or inappro-priate.
I t  is well-known that for these and otherreasons, a machine translation of a whole text isusually of rather uneven quality.
There is analternative to translating the whole text --na~nely, "selective translation," a notion whichwil l  be discussed further later on.Revision of the raw machine translation by ahuman translator seems at f i rs t  to be an attractiveway to compensate for whatever errors may occur inthe raw machine translation.
However, revision iseffective only i f  the raw translation is alreadynearly acceptable.
Brinkmann (Ig8O) concludedthat even i f  only 20% of the text needs revision,i t  is better to translate from scratch instead ofrevising.The author worked on a system with this stan-dard design for a whole decade (from 1970 to 1980).This design can, of course, work very well.
Theauthor's major objection to this ~esign is that i tmust be almost perfect or i t  is nearly useless.In other words, the system does not become pro-gressively more useful as the output improves frombeing 50% correct to 60% to 70% to 80% to 90%.Instead, the system is nearly useless as the out-put improves and passes some threshold of quality.Then, all of a sudden, the system becomes veryuseful.
I t  would, of course, be preferable towork with a design which allows the system to be-come progressivelv more useful.Here is a summary of objections to the stan-dard design:WHY COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTS 00 NOT LIKE IT:Because even i f  the algorithms start out "clean",they must be kludged to make sure that somethinocomes out for every sentence that goes in.WHY TRANSLATORS DO NOT LIKE IT:Because they feel that they are tools of the sys-tem instead of artists using a tool.WHY SPONSORS DO NOT LIKE IT:Because the system has to be worked on for a lonQtime and be almost perfect before i t  can bedetermined whether or not any useful result wi l lbe obtained.II AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGNThere has been for some time a real alter-native to the standard design -- namely, trans-lator aids.
These translator aids have beenprincipally terminology aids of various kinds andsome use of standard word processing.
These aidshave been found to be clearly useful.
However,they have not attracted the attention of computa-tional linguists because they do not involve anyreally interesting or challengina linguisticprocessing.
This is not to say that they areI "T&t r iv ia l .
I t  is, in fact, quite d i f f icu l t  to per-fect a reliable, user-frlendly word processor ora secure, easy to use automated ictionary.
Butthe challenge is more in the area of computerscience and engineering than in computationallinguistics.Until now, there has not been much realintegration of work in machine translation andtranslator aids.
This paper is a proposal for asystem design which allows Just such an integra-tion.
The proposed system consists of two piecesof hardware: (1) a translator work station(probably a single-user micro-computer) and (2)a "selective" machine translation system (prob-ably running on a mainframe).
The translatorwork station is a three-level system of aids.All three levels look much the same to the trans-later.
At each level, the translator works at akeyboard and video display.
The display is di-vided into two major windows.
The bottom windowcontains the current segment of translated text.I t  is a work area, and nothing goes in i t  exceptwhat the translator puts there.
The upper windowcontains various aids such as dictionary entriessegments of source text, or  suggested translation~To the translator, the difference betweenthe various levels is simply the nature of theaids that appear in the upper window; and thetranslator in all cases produces the translationa segment at a time in the lower window.
Inter-nally, however, the three levels are vastly dif-ferent.Level 1 is the lowest level of aid to thetranslator.
At this level, there is no need fordata ent~ of the source text.
The translator cansit  down with a source text on paper and begintranslating immediately.
The system at this levelincludes word processing of the target text,access to a terminology f i le ,  and access to anexpansion code f i le  to speed up use of connmnlyencountered terms.Level 2 is an intermediate level at whichthe source text must be available in machine read-able form.
I t  can be entered remotely and sup-plied to the translator (e.g.
on a diskette) or i tcan be entered at the translator work station.Level 2 provides all the aids available at level land two additional aids -?
(a) preprocessing ofthe source text to search for unusual or misspel-led terms, etc., and (b) dynamic processing ofthe source text as i t  is translated.
The trans-lator sees in the upper window the current segmentof text to be translated and suggested translationsof selected words and phrases found by automati-cally identifying the words of the current segmentof source text and looking them up in the bilingualdictionary that can be accessed manually in levelI.Level 3 requires a separate machine trans-lation system and an interface to i t .
Instead ofsupplying just the source text to the translatorwork station, the work station receives (on disk-ette or through a network) the source text and(for each segment of source text) either a machine17.5translation of the segment or an indication of thereason for failure of the machine translationsystem on that segment.
This explains the notionof "selective" machine translation referred topreviously.
A selective machine translation sys-tem does not attempt to translate even segmentof text.
I t  contains a formal model of languagewhich may or may not accept a given segment ofsource text.
I f  a given segment fails in analy-sis, transfer, or generation, a reason is given.I f  no failure occurs, a machine translation ofthat segment is produced and a problem record isattached to the segment indicating diff lcult iesencountered, such as arbitrary choices made.Level 3 provides to the translator all the aidsof levels l & Z.
In addition, the translator hasthe option of specifying a maximum acceptableproblem level.
When a segment of source text isdisplayed, i f  the machine translation of that seg-ment has a problem level which is low enough, themachine translation of that segment wil l  be dis-played below the source text instead of the levelZ suggestions.
The translator can examine themachine translation of a given segment and, i f  i tis Judged to be good enough by the translator,the translator can pull i t  down into the bottomwindow with a single keystroke and revise i t  asneeded.
Note that writing a selective machinetranslation system need not mean starting fromscratch.
I t  should be possible to take any exist-Ing machine translation system and modify i t  tobe a selective translation system.
Note that thetranslator work station can provide valuable feed-back to the machine translation development teamby recording which segments of machine translation~re seen by the translator and whether they wereused and i f  so how revised.The standard design for a machine translationsystem and the alternative mul ti- level designjust described use essentially the same components.They both involve data entry of the source text(although the data entry is needed only at levels2 and 3 in the multi-level design).
They bothinvolve machine translation (although the machinetranslation is needed only at level 3 in the multi-level design).
And they both involve interactionwith a human translator.
In the standard design,this interaction consists of human revision of theraw machine translation.
In the multi-level de-sign, this interaction consists of human trans-lation in which the human uses word processing,terminology lookup, and suggested translationsfrom the computer.
At one extreme (level l ) ,  themulti-level system involves no machine translationat a l l ,  and the system is l i t t le  more than anintegrated word processor and terminology f i le .At the other extreme (level 3), the multi-levelsystem could act much the same as the standarddesign.
I f  eve.e.ve~.~.sentence of the source textreceived a machine translation with a hiqh qualityestimate, then the translation could conceivablybe produced by the translator choosing to pulleach segment of translated text into the trans-lation work area and revise i t  as needed.
Thedifference between the two designs becomesapparent only when the raw machine translation isnot almost perfect.
In that case, which is ofcourse common, the multi-level system continuesto produce translations with the human translatortranslating more segments using level l and level2 aids instead of level ~ aids; the translationprocess continues with some loss of speed but nomajor d i f f icu l ty .
When the same raw machinetranslation is placed in a standard design con-text, the translator is expected to revise i t  inspite of the problems, and according to theauthor's experience, the translators tend tobecome frustrated and unhappy with their work.Both designs use the same components but putthem together differently.
See Figure I.Here is a summary of the arguments for amulti-level design:WHY COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTS LIKE IT:Because they can set up a "clean" formal modeland keep i t  clean, because there is no pressureto produce a translation for every sentence thatgoes in.WHY TRANSLATORS LIKE IT:Because the system is truly a tool for the trans-lator.
The translator is never pressured toFigure 1 Two DesignsSTANDARD DESIGNi,Source text .

Of course, i f  the rawmachine translation of a sentence is very goodand needs only a minor change or two, the trans-lator wi l l  naturally pull i t  down and revise i tbecause that is so much faster and easier thantranslating from scratch.WHY SPONSORS LIKE IT:Because the system is useful after a modestinvestment in level I.
Then level 2 is addedand the system becomes more useful.
Whilethe system is being used at levels l and 2, level3 is developed and the machine translation sys-tem becomes a useful component of the multi-level system when only a small fraction of thesource sentences receive a good machine trans-lation.
Thus, there is a measurable resultobtained from each increment of investment.WEAVER, WARREN.
