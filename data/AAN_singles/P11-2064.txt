MohammadInstitute for Information TechnologyNational Research Council Canada.Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1A 0R6saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.caAbstractColour is a key component in the success-ful dissemination of information.
Sincemany real-world concepts are associated withcolour, for example danger with red, linguisticinformation is often complemented with theuse of appropriate colours in information vi-sualization and product marketing.
Yet, thereis no comprehensive resource that capturesconcept?colour associations.
We present amethod to create a large word?colour asso-ciation lexicon by crowdsourcing.
A word-choice question was used to obtain sense-levelannotations and to ensure data quality.
We fo-cus especially on abstract concepts and emo-tions to show that even they tend to havestrong colour associations.
Thus, using theright colours can not only improve semanticcoherence, but also inspire the desired emo-tional response.1 IntroductionColour is a vital component in the successful deliv-ery of information, whether it is in marketing a com-mercial product (Sable and Akcay, 2010), in webdesign (Meier, 1988; Pribadi et al, 1990), or in in-formation visualization (Christ, 1975; Card et al,1999).
Since real-world concepts have associationswith certain colour categories (for example, dangerwith red, and softness with pink), complementinglinguistic and non-linguistic information with appro-priate colours has a number of benefits, including:(1) strengthening the message (improving semanticcoherence), (2) easing cognitive load on the receiver,(3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evokingthe desired emotional response.
Consider, for exam-ple, the use of red in stop signs.
Drivers are able torecognize the sign faster, and it evokes a subliminalemotion pertaining to possible danger, which is en-tirely appropriate in the context.
The use of red toshow areas of high crime rate in a visualization isanother example of good use of colour to draw emo-tional response.
On the other hand, improper useof colour can be more detrimental to understandingthan using no colour (Marcus, 1982; Meier, 1988).A word has strong association with a colour whenthe colour is a salient feature of the concept theword refers to, or because the word is related toa such a concept.
Many concept?colour associa-tions, such as swan with white and vegetables withgreen, involve physical entities.
However, even ab-stract notions and emotions may have colour as-sociations (honesty?white, danger?red, joy?yellow,anger?red).
Further, many associations are culture-specific (Gage, 1969; Chen, 2005).
For example,prosperity is associated with red in much of Asia.Unfortunately, there exists no lexicon with anysignificant coverage that captures these concept?colour associations, and a number of questions re-main unanswered, such as, the extent to which hu-mans agree with each other on these associations,and whether physical concepts are more likely tohave a colour association than abstract ones.In this paper, we describe how we created a largeword?colour lexicon by crowdsourcing with effec-tive quality control measures (Section 3), as well asexperiments and analyses to show that:?
More than 30% of the terms have a strongcolour association (Sections 4).368?
About 33% of thesaurus categories have strongcolour associations (Section 5).?
Abstract terms have colour associations almostas often as physical entities do (Section 6).?
There is a strong association between differentemotions and colours (Section 7).Thus, using the right colours can not only improvesemantic coherence, but also inspire the desiredemotional response.2 Related WorkThe relation between language and cognition has re-ceived considerable attention over the years, mainlyon answering whether language impacts thought,and if so, to what extent.
Experiments withcolour categories have been used both to showthat language has an effect on thought (Brown andLenneberg, 1954; Ratner, 1989) and that it does not(Bornstein, 1985).
However, that line of work doesnot explicitly deal with word?colour associations.
Infact, we did not find any other academic work thatgathered large word?colour associations.
There is,however, a commercial endeavor?Cymbolism1.Child et al (1968), Ou et al (2011), and othersshow that people of different ages and genders havedifferent colour preferences.
(See also the onlinestudy by Joe Hallock2.)
In this work, we are inter-ested in identifying words that have a strong associa-tion with a colour due to their meaning; associationsthat are not affected by age and gender preferences.There is substantial work on inferring the emo-tions evoked by colour (Luscher, 1969; Kaya, 2004).Strapparava and Ozbal (2010) compute corpus-based semantic similarity between emotions andcolours.
We combine a word?colour and a word?emotion lexicon to determine the association be-tween emotion words and colours.Berlin and Kay (1969), and later Kay and Maffi(1999), showed that often colour terms appeared inlanguages in certain groups.
If a language has onlytwo colour terms, then they are white and black.
If alanguage has three colour terms, then they tend to bewhite, black, and red.
Such groupings are seen forup to eleven colours, and based on these groupings,colours can be ranked as follows:1http://www.cymbolism.com/about2http://www.joehallock.com/edu/COM498/preferences.html1.
white, 2. black, 3. red, 4. green, 5. yel-low, 6. blue, 7. brown, 8. pink, 9. purple,10.
orange, 11. grey (1)There are hundreds of different words for colours.3To make our task feasible, we chose to use the elevenbasic colour words of Berlin and Kay (1969).The MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart,1981) has, among other information, the imageabil-ity ratings for 9240 words.4 The imageability rat-ing is a score given by human judges that reflectshow easy it is to visualize the concept.
It is a scalefrom 100 (very hard to visualize) to 700 (very easyto visualize).
We use the ratings in our experimentsto determine whether there is a correlation betweenimageability and strength of colour association.3 CrowdsourcingWe used the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986)as the source for terms to be annotated by peopleon Mechanical Turk.5 Thesauri, such as the Roget?sand Macquarie, group related words into categories.These categories can be thought of as coarse senses(Yarowsky, 1992; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006).
Ifa word is ambiguous, then it is listed in more thanone category.
Since we were additionally interestedin determining colour signatures for emotions (Sec-tion 7), we chose to annotate all of the 10,170 word?sense pairs that Mohammad and Turney (2010) usedto create their word?emotion lexicon.
Below is anexample questionnaire:Q1.

yellowQ1 is a word choice question generated automati-cally by taking a near-synonym from the thesaurusand random distractors.
If an annotator answersthis question incorrectly, then we discard informa-tion from both Q1 and Q2.
The near-synonym alsoguides the annotator to the desired sense of the word.Further, it encourages the annotator to think clearly3See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of colors4http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/mrcdatabase/uwa mrc.htm5Mechanical Turk: www.mturk.com369white black red green yellow blue brown pink purple orange greyoverall 11.9 12.2 11.7 12.0 11.0 9.4 9.6 8.6 4.2 4.2 4.6voted 22.7 18.4 13.4 12.1 10.0 6.4 6.3 5.3 2.1 1.5 1.3Table 1: Percentage of terms marked as being associated with each colour.about the target word?s meaning; we believe this im-proves the quality of the annotations in Q2.The colour options in Q2 were presented in ran-dom order.
We do not provide a ?not associatedwith any colour?
option to encourage colour selec-tion even if the association is weak.
If there is noassociation between a word and a colour, then weexpect low agreement for that term.
We requestedannotations from five different people for each term.The annotators on Mechanical Turk, by design,are anonymous.
However, we requested annotationsfrom US residents only.4 Word?Colour AssociationAbout 10% of the annotations had an incorrect an-swer to Q1.
Since, for these instances, the annotatordid not know the meaning of the target word, wediscarded the corresponding colour association re-sponse.
Terms with less than three valid annotationswere discarded from further analysis.
Each of theremaining terms has, on average, 4.45 distinct anno-tations.
The information from multiple annotatorswas combined by taking the majority vote, result-ing in a lexicon with 8,813 entries.
Each entry con-tains a unique word?synonym pair, majority votedcolour(s), and a confidence score?number of votesfor the colour / number of total votes.
(For the analy-ses in Sections 5, 6, and 7, ties were broken by pick-ing one colour at random.)
A separate version of thelexicon that includes entries for all of the valid anno-tations by each of the annotators is also available.6The first row in Table 1 shows the percentage oftimes different colours were associated with the tar-get term.
The second row shows percentages af-ter taking a majority vote of the annotators.
Eventhough the colour options were presented in randomorder, the order of the most frequently associatedcolours is identical to the Berlin and Kay order (Sec-tion 2:(1)).The number of ambiguous words annotated was2924.

8/11?7/11 = 0.344.
Thus, if there was no correlationamong any of the terms and colours, then 34.4% ofthe time none of the annotators would have agreedwith each other.
However, this happens only 15.1%of the time.
A large number of terms have a ma-jority class size ?
2 (84.9%), and thus have morethan chance association with a colour.
One can ar-gue that terms with a majority class size ?
3 (32%)have strong colour associations.Below are some reasons why agreement valuesare much lower than certain other tasks, for exam-ple, part of speech tagging:?
The annotators were not given a ?not associ-ated with any colour?
option.
Low agreementfor certain instances is an indicator that thesewords have weak, if any, colour association.Therefore, inter-annotator agreement does notcorrelate with quality of annotation.370Figure 1: Scatter plot of thesaurus categories.
The area of high colour association is shaded.
Some points are labeled.?
Words are associated with colours to differentdegrees.
Some words may be associated withmore than one colour by comparable degrees,and there might be higher disagreement.?
The target word?sense pair is presented out ofcontext.
We expect higher agreement if we pro-vided words in context, but words can occur ininnumerable contexts, and annotating too manyinstances of the same word is costly.Nonetheless, the lexicon is useful for downstreamapplications because any of the following strategiesmay be employed: (1) choosing colour associationsfrom only those instances with high agreement, (2)assuming low-agreement terms have no colour asso-ciation, (3) determining colour association of a cat-egory through information from many words, as de-scribed in the next section.5 Category?Colour AssociationDifferent words within a thesaurus category may notbe strongly associated with any colour, or they maybe associated with many different colours.
We nowdetermine whether there exist categories where thesemantic coherence carries over to a strong commonassociation with one colour.We determine the strength of colour associationof a category by first determining the colour c mostassociated with the terms in it, and then calculatingthe ratio of the number of times a word from the cat-egory is associated with c to the number of words inthe category associated with any colour.
Only cate-gories that had at least four words that also appearin the word?colour lexicon were considered; 535 ofthe 812 categories from Macquarie Thesaurus metthis condition.
If a category has exactly four wordsthat appear in the colour lexicon, and if all fourwords are associated with different colours, then thecategory has the lowest possible strength of colourassociation?0.25 (1/4).
19 categories had a scoreof 0.25.
No category had a score less than 0.25.
Anyscore above 0.25 shows more than random chanceassociation with a colour.
There were 516 such cat-egories (96.5%).
177 categories (33.1%) had a score0.5 or above, that is, half or more of the words inthese categories are associated with one colour.
Weconsider these to be strong associations.6 ImageabilityIt is natural for physical entities of a certain colourto be associated with that colour.
However, abstractconcepts such as danger and excitability are also as-sociated with colours?red and orange, respectively.Figure 1 displays an experiment to determinewhether there is a correlation between imageabilityand association with colour.We define imageability of a thesaurus category tobe the average of the imageability ratings of wordsin it.
We calculated imageability for the 535 cate-gories described in the previous section using onlythe words that appear in the colour lexicon.
Figure 1shows the scatter plot of these categories on the im-ageability and strength of colour association axes.

Instead, we observe that the strongly associ-ated categories are spread all across the imageabilityaxis, implying that there is only weak, if any, corre-lation.
Imageability and colour association have aPearson?s product moment correlation of 0.116, anda Spearman?s rank order correlation of 0.102.7 The Colour of Emotion WordsEmotions such as joy, sadness, and anger are ab-stract concepts dealing with one?s psychologicalstate.
As pointed out in Section 2, there is prior workon emotions evoked by colours.
In contrast, herewe investigate the colours associated with emotionwords.
We combine the word?emotion associationlexicon compiled by Mohammad and Turney (2010;2011) and our word?colour lexicon to determinethe colour signature of emotions?the rows in Ta-ble 4.
Notably, we see that all of the emotions havestrong associations with certain colours.
Observethat anger is associated most with red.
Other nega-tive emotions?disgust, fear, sadness?go strongestwith black.
Among the positive emotions: antici-pation is most frequently associated with white andgreen; joy with white, green, and yellow; and trustwith white, blue, and green.
Table 4 shows thecolour signature for terms marked positive and neg-ative (these include terms that may not be associatedwith the eight basic emotions).
Observe that the neg-ative terms are strongly associated with black andred, whereas the positive terms are strongly associ-ated with white and green.
Thus, colour can addto the potency of emotional concepts, yielding evenmore effective visualizations.8 Conclusions and Future WorkWe created a large word?colour association lexi-con by crowdsourcing.
A word-choice question wasused to guide the annotator to the desired sense ofthe target word, and to ensure data quality.
We ob-served that abstract concepts, emotions in particu-lar, have strong colour associations.
Thus, using theright colours in tasks such as information visualiza-tion, product marketing, and web development, cannot only improve semantic coherence, but also in-spire the desired psychological response.
Interest-ingly, we found that frequencies of colour choice inassociations follow the same order in which colourterms occur in language (Berlin and Kay, 1969).Future work includes developing automatic corpus-based methods to determine the strength of word?colour association, and the extent to which strongword?colour associations manifest themselves asmore-than-random chance co-occurrence in text.AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by the National ResearchCouncil Canada (NRC).
