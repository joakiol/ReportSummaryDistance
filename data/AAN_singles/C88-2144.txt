THE ANALYSIS OF TENSE AND ASPECT IN EUROTRAFrank VAN EYNDEEurotra - LeuvenMaria-Theresias~aat 213000 LeuvenBEI.~IUMABSTRACTThis papua plesel~ts a framework tot the modebfl~eoleticanalysis of tense and aspect onns in diseomse.
It has beendeveloped for Eurot~'a, the MT project of the EuropeauCommunity, and has been applied to the nine Eurotralanguages: English, German, Dutch, Danish, Greek, Italian,French, Spanish and Portuguese.The paper censis~s of six parts.
The first presents the prob-lem of translating tense and aspect forms and indicates thetype of solution I envisage.
The second contains a formal-ism for tile.
representation f time meanings.
The third andthe fourth present a theory of tense and aspect respectively.The fifth discusses the issue of compositionality and thesixth is at;out the use of the system in the Eurotra frame-work.1.
THE PROBLEMIt is a facL of language that the number and the use of thetense and aspect forms are different for every language.Even for closely related languages the differences teld tobe large.
As a consequence, it is not possible to state one-to-one conespondences between the tense and aspect formsof different languages.

THE FORMALISMAs a starting point I take the temporal structure <T,<,ca>,where T is a set of intervals, < is a binary relation thatlinearly orders time (precedence), and n is a binary opera-tion on intervals (intersection).An interval is a continuous ubpart of the time line (a).
Itmay consist of one single moment of time (b), but it can-not contain any gaps (c):I I(a)  .

The time of event (E) is tile intervalfor which a basic tenseless proposition is said to be true,and the function of the tense and aspect forms is to definethe relation between that interval and the time of speech(S) via the intermediary time of reference (R.).For the analysis of clauses in context I make use of a gen-eralised model (cf.
3.4.).3.
A THEORY OF TENSE3.1.
file tense meaningsTense meanings will be defined as relations between a timeof reference and a time of speech : Rel(R,S).The number of possible tense meanings is, hence, equal tothe number of possible relations between R and S, which isseven (cf.
2.).
However, since the time of speech is gen-erally conceived to be a moment of time rather than aninterval of some length, some of these relations carmot holdin principle.
The overlap-relations (<< and >>), for instance,can tufty obtain between two intervals of a certain length,and the proper part-of relation (c) cannot hold between Rand S either, for if S is one moment of time, R can onlybe a proper part of S if it is smaller than a moment,which is impossible.Furthermore, there seems to be no linguistic evidence lotmaking a distinction between proper inclusion (w) and iden-tity (=), since "... languages do not have distinct grammatioeal categories of tense indicating location in time at a par-.ticular point vs. location in time surrounding a particularpoint."
\[Comrie 1985, 123\]As a consequence, the number of possible relations betweenR and S can be reduced to the following three:<(R,S) = anteriority>(R,S) = posteriority~(R,S) = simultaneityThese COlTespond to the traditional concepts of Past, Futureand Present.
Notice, however, that the latter is not definedin terms of identity, but in terms of improper inclusion.The language specific forms for the expl~ession of theseconcepts are the tense forms and the time adverbials.3.2.
tire deictic time adverbialsTypical examples of deictic time adverbials are "now","tomorrow", and "two weeks ago".
Their function is torelate the time of ~eference to the time of speech.
Depend-ing on the kind of relation they express they can becharactefised assimultaneous : now ...anterior : yesterday, two weeks ago ...posterior : tomorrow, next summer ...7{303.3. the tense formsIn contrast to the tense meanings which are languageindependent he tense forms are langnage specilic.
Theirnumber, names and distribution differ from language tolanguage.As h~r the Eumtra languages there seem to be two type~ oftelJse fonn systems: the one of the Romance langllages v~Mthe one of the Germanic languages and Greek.An example of the latter type is English:tense form --~ \[+/.-ED\] (will+infinitiw;)yielding\[-ED\] ~ ,= lh~esent play\[+ED\] f3 = Past played\[uED\] will =: Future will play\[+ED\] will = Condilion~ would playThere is a bound morpheme \[+/4~:D\] and an optional auxili--ary "will".
The latter can "also have a modal meaning, espe-cially in its past tense lonn, bnt in this context I will onlydiscuss its temporal meaning.An examtfle of the former type is French:tensefo~m--~ \[\[+/-R\]\[+/-AIS\]\]Pass6yieldingi-R\] \[-AIS\] = Pr6sent joue\[+R\] \[-AIS\] = Fntur joueraii-R\] \[+AIS\] = Imparfait jouais\[+R\] \[+AIS\] = Conditionnel jouelaisPass6 = Pass~ jouaiIn this system the tense forms are combinations of boundmoq)heines; there are no anxiliaries involved.As for the meanings of the tense forms they will bedefined as elements of the power set of possible tensemeanings.
This power set contains eight elements :{~, {<), {>), (~}, {<,>1, (<,_~}, (>,~l, 1<,>,~}).Not all of these combinations can be assigned to particularlense forms, though, for there are a few general constraints.Bernard Comrie has argued, lbr instance, that "in a tensesystem, the time reference of each tense is a continuity"\[Comrie 1985, 50\].
This implies that there can be no tenselbm~s which can express posteriority and anteriority withoutexpressing simultaneity as welt.
The combination {ante,post}can, hence, be discarded a priori.
For the Eurotra languagesthis restficition appears to hold.A second restricition concerns tile combinatiotts {ante,simnl}and {post,simul}.
The former is a possible me,'ming inlanguages which make a basic distinction between Future({post}) and non-Fut~e ({ante,simul}) ; the latter is a pos-sible meaning in languages which make a basic distinctionbetween Past ({ante}) and non-Past ({post,simul}).
Since ah'mguage cam~ot belong to both types at the same time, itfollows that for any given langnage either file contbination{post,simul} or the combination {ante,simld} is rnl~ out.As far as the Enrotra languages are concerned, they allbelong to the latter type.In older to find out wtfieh of tile six remaining combina.tions can he assigned to file tense forms one can make nseof a grammatie,'dity est : a tense from X can have ameaning Y (where Y is any of {simultaneous, anterior, pos-terior}), if and only if it can be combined with a deicticadverbial of type Y.The application of this test to Englishthe following results :Er~glish :and French yieldsFrench :Present -4 {post,simul}Past ~-~ {~nte}Future ~ {post}Conditional ~-~ 0PrEsent ~ {post,simul }Futur ~ {post}lmparfalt --~ {ante}Condifionnel --~ 0Pas~ --o { ante }The conditional tenses get the value O since they do nothave a temporal meaning in single isolated clauses (cf.3.6.).3.4.
a discourse modelThe model presented so far is useftd for the analysis ofisolated clauses.
For tl~e analysis of texts we need anextension, or rather a generalisation of the original model.The main extensions concern the introduction of anotherkind of interval, the point of perspective P (the term isbon~wed from \[Rohrer 1985\]), and the addition of indicesto the intervals.Instead of defining the time of reference with respect o thetime of speech I will now define its position with respectto the point of perspective.
For any clanse i which is partof a discourse, there will be one peint of perspective Piand one time of reference Ri.
If the clause is the lirst mainclause of the discourse, then its point of perspective isderived from the time of speech.
In other cases the pointof perstx~'ctive will be, derived fl~m tile time of reference ofa dominating or preceding clause.An example:R0 ANCHORING TENSE(1) V she R1promisedthat ~-~ ......
pie-.--) V(PI,R0) & <(RI,I'1)she would V R2come on __,...~7~ ...... --_) V(P2,R1) & >(R2,P2)Monday P2 V R2=Mondaybut she R3lnmed up .......... ...i7z3__~ V(P3,R2) & >(R3,P3)2 days P3 R3=WednesdaylaterThe notation "V(Pi,Rjy means that Pi is derived from Rj.The interval Rj from wlfich the pesition of Pi is derivedwill be called the temporal antecedent of the clause withpoint of perspective Pi.
In the example the temporalantecedent of the third clause is "Monday" (R2), the tem-poral antecedent of the second clause is the time of herpromising (R1), and the temporal antecedent of the firstclause is the lime of speech (R0=S).Notice that file temporal antecedent of a clause i need notalways be the time of reference of the immediately preced-ing clau,~:e (Ri-1).
In the sequence(2) she promised that she would come on Monday, butthen she changed her mindthe temporal antecedent Of the third clause is the thne ofher prondsing (R1) rather than "Monday", and in(3) she promised that she would come on Monday, butnow it seems that she cannotthe temporal antecedent of the third clause is the time ofspeech : "now" refers back to the time of speech directly.The differences between the discourse model and the origi-nal temporal model are minor: the tense meanings are nowrelations between Ri and Pi (instead of between R and S)but, since Pi is always a moment of lime (just like S), thenumber of possible tense meanings remains the same.
Theexpressive power of the tormalism, however, has beenenhanced considerably.
It now provides a formalism lbrthe temporal analysis of all types of clauses - whetherenrbedded or not, whether isolated or in context - and forthe description of anaphoric temporal expressions.
The latterwill be discussed in the next paragraphs.3.5.
the anaphorie time adverbialsThere is a class of adverbials which do not refer to thetime of speech, as the deictie ones, but rather to the timeof relerence of a dominating or preceding clause.
They canalso be grouped in the three subclassessimultan : the same time, at that moment ...anterior : two weeks before, previously ...posterior : one week later, then ...Together with the deictic adverbials they form the class ofrelational time adverbials.For completeness sake I 'also mention the locational timeadverbials, such as "at 2 o'clock", "on Monday" and "inthe summer".
They do not express any relational informa-tion and can, therefore, be combined with all possibletcoses.Common to both the relational and the locational timeadverbials is that they can be used as ,answers to "when"-questions.
In this respect they differ from the a.
';pectualadverbials (cf.
4.3.).3.6.
anaphoric tensesThe use of the tense forms in texts is somewhat differentfrom their use in single isolated clauses.
This is due to thefact that in anterior contexts the present is often replacedby file past and the future by the conditional.
Thisphenomenon, which is called transposition (of.
Rohrer1985), can be seen at work in the following sentences:(4) he said that he was ill(5) he entered the room and fell on his faceIn (4) tbe time of Iris being ill is simultaneous with hissaying that he is ill, and in (5) the time of his falling onhis face is posterior to the time of his entering the room.In both cases one would expect a present tense in thesecond clause, bnt since the first clause is in the past, tran-sposition applies and results in the use of the past tense.Tfie discourse diagrams for these sentences look as follows:701R0=S(4)' !

In theformer case one first maps the past on the present and theconditional on the future and then applies the normal rulesfor the assignment of meanings.
In the latter case onedefines extra rules for the assignment of meanings to thepast and the conditional tenses.The former alternative is more constrained than the latterand, hence, more attractive, but the choice for the one orthe other might turn out to be language dependent.4.
A THEORY OF ASPECT4.1.
the aspect meahingsThere is a considerable confusion in the literature about thedefinition of aspect.
This is largely due to the fact thatmany authors donot make a distinction between grammaticalaspect and lexical aspect.
The former concerns the syntaxand semantics of aspectual auxiliaries and adverbials,whereas the latter concerns the semantics of main verbs andpropositions (cf.
the event/state/process distinction).
In thispaper I will use the term aspect for the former only.
Thelatter will be called Aktionsart.As a general definition of aspect I will adopt the formula-tion by Marion Johnson: "What I am proposing concerningthe semantiCS of the aspect forms is that they specify therelation between reference time and event time in an utter-ance."
\[Johnson 1981, 153\]Starting from this definition of aspect meanings as binaryrelations between intervals and combining it with the obser-vation that the number of possible binary relations betweenintervals is seven (of.
2.)
it is possible to predict that therewill be seven aspectual relations.
In the following para-graphs I will discuss them in some detail and relate themto the traditional aspectological terminology.A well-known aspectual distinction is the one between theperfective and the imperfective.
The perfective presents asituation as a single unanalysable whole, whereas the imper-fective looks at a situation from the inside and focusses onthe beginning, ending or continuation of it (el.
Comrie1976, 3-4).As formal counterparts of these definitions I propose therelations =(E,R) and c(E,R) for the perfective :702E ~ER RE E...... -EEEE~---~ - - - ~ - ~R RThese relations express the intuition that ti~ time of event(E) is seen as one unanalysable whole from the point ofview of the reference time.
The formal definition of theperfective is, hence, ~(E,R).For the imperfoctive I will make a distinction between threetypes.
If the focus is on the continuation, the aspect isdurative.
For its representation I use the relation of properinclusion : D(E,R).E ER RThe situation is clearly looked at from the inside : R is inE.For the two other types of imperfectivity I will make useof the overlap relations :E E.~F- '272~.
.
.~  .
.t-Z'YY77&L......ZZS.T -.q,R R>>(E,R) <<0~,R)In the ease of right overlap the focus is on the beginningof the situation.
This aspect I will call the inchoative.
Inthe case of left overlap the focus is on the end of thesituation.
This aspect I will call the terminative.Another aspect that is often mentioned in the literature isthe socalled perfect (# perfective !).
In conformity withReichenbach, Johnson and others I will analyse it in termsof precedence : <(E,R).
I will, however, not use the term"perfect" for it, but rather the term "retrospective".
The rea-son for this is that the perfect aspect form should be dis-tingnished from the retrospective aspect meaning : theformer is syntactic, the latter is semantic, and the relationbetween both is not necessarily one-to-one.Finally, there is the inverse of the retrospective, i.e.
theprospective : >(E,R).
It is one of the meanings of theEnglish "be going to" and of the French auxiliary "aller".In short, there are six different aspect meanings.
Theirlanguage specific counterparts are aspeetual auxiliaries andadverbials.4.2.
the aspectual auxiliariesAs for the Eumtra languages the aspect form systems howa larger diversity than the tense form systems.Some typical aspectual distinctions are the ones between- perfect and non-perfect (have + past participle)- progressive and non-progressive (be + present participle)- go and non-gu (go + to-infinitive)The first distinction is made in all of the Eumtm languages,but the two other ones are not eumversal.
They are presentin English, but not ha German and Danish, for instance,and French has the third distinction, but not the second.It may be worth stressing that I will only analyse theaspectaal anxiliaries.
Full lexical verbs, such as "stop","start" and "continue", and periphrastic forms, such as "~treen train de" and "venir de", will not be discussed here.l?br English, the set of aspectual auxiliaries can be definedas follows:aspectO ?5have Of~ behave beO behave bel;br French,aspectlonn --) (have+papa) (be+prpa(go+to-int))f~ = Simple rainO = Perfect have rainedO = Progressive be miningO =Per f  Progr have been raininggo = Go be going to raingo = Perfect Go have been going to rainthe definition looks as follows :lbrm --> \[ avoir/~tre+papaaller+inf \]O = Simple pleuvoiravoir/~tre = Compost avoir plualler = Futur proche aller pleuvoirAs tor the assignment of meanings to the auxiliaries I willfollow the same procedure as for the tense meanings.
Themeaning of an aspect form is an element of the power setof possible aspect meanings.
This set contains 64 elements.For the dr;fruition of the mappings one can start from thefollowing euroversal scheme (euroversal = common to thenine Eurotra languages) :simple -~ {perfective}perfect --> {retrospective}go ~ {inchoafive}progressive -~ {durativc}If one of these tbrms is not present in the language, itsmeaning may he expressed by another form.
In general thiswill be the form whose basic meaning is the least distantfrom the meaning to be expressed.
For a specification ofthe notion of distance between meanings I will use the fol-lowing scheme:retm term perf, dur incho pro< << .~ , =3 >> >1 2 3 4 5The distance between two ,aspect meanings is equal to thedifference of their numbers.it follows frmn the principle of minimal distance that alanguage without a progressive will express the durative bymeans of the form which expresses the perfective (13-31=0),i.e.
the simple form.
This is indeed tree for French,Dutch, German and Danish.Tbe principle also guides the choice of a form for theexpression of file terminative.
Some languages have a spe-cial form for this aspect.
English, for instance, has the per-\[izct progrcssive for this meaning.
Most languages, however,donot have such a tbrm and in those cases the minimaldistance principle predicts which forms can be used for theexpression of terminativity, i.e the (retrospective) perfectlbrm, the (perfective) simple form or the (durative) progres-sive foim: 12.-11=12-31=1 (see also 4.3.
).Taking into account he basic scheme and the principle ofminimal distance, ,and complementing it with languagespecific observations, one can derive the following mappingsfor English and French:English :French :Simple --> {pelf}Perfect --~ {retro,term}Progressive ~ {dur,perf}Perf progr --~ {term}Go ~ {incho,pro }Perfect Go --4 OSimple --~ {perf,dur,term }Compost ~ { retro,tenn }Futur proche ~ {incho,pro}4.3. aspectual dverbialsTile aspectual adverbials include the duration adverbials andthe boundary adverbials.The duration adverbials pecify the length of the time ofevent.
Depending on whether the basic proposition is anevent or a state/process they are expressed by an 1N-adverbial or a FOR-adverbial:(7) she ran the mile in five minutt~(8) he has been sleeping for ten hours(9) we have been in France for a monthThey do not express any relational information.The boundary adverbials specify the beginning and/or theend of the time of event.
They are prepositional pbrasesintroduced by "since", "from", "until", "till", "from .. till".One of these expresses relational information: the "since"-adverbials denote an interval which begins in the past atsome specified time, e.g.
Christmas in "since Chrismlas".The end point of such an interval is not specified by theadverbial, but is normally taken to be included in the timeof reference.
The relation between time of event and timeof reference will, hence, be one of overlap:EXmas RIt tbllows that "since" adverbials express terminativity andthat the compatibility of these adverbials with the aspectforms can be used as a test for deciding whether a givenaspect form can be terminative.What the aspectual adverbials have in common is that theycan be used as answers to "how long"-questions.
This dis-tinguishes them from the time adverbials.5.
DEGREES OF COMPOSITIONALITYTense and aspect forms do not occur in isolation: finiteverbs have both a tense form and an aspect form.
Themeaning of their combination is the relational product ofthe meanings of the tense form and the meanings of theaspect form.
An example: the meaning of the Englishpresent perfect progressive is the relational product of themeanings of the present tense with the meanings of theperfect progressive aspect.
In other words, the meaning ofthe present perfect progressive is compositional.Not all combinations of tense and aspect are compositional,though.
In some cases a form can have a meaning whichcannot be derived eompositionally, in other cases a formmay lack a meaning which can be derived compositionally.703An 'example of the former type is the present perfect inlanguages like French, Dutch and German.
Apart from oreven instead of its compositional meanings this form has an<anterior, peffective> meaning, i .e .
the meaning of theEnglish simple past.
This appears a.o.
from their compatibil-ity with anterior time adverbials:FR je l'ai vu bierDU ik beb hem gisteren gezienGE ich habe ihn gestem gesehenEN * I have seen him yesterdayI saw him yesterdayAn example of the latter type is the French passd simple.The simple aspect can have three different meanings inFrench, but in combination with the passg, it can only havethe perfective interpretation: the durative and the terminativemeaning are expressed by the imparfait.Depending on how many exceptions there are, the tenseand aspect system of a given language will be more or lesscompositional.
In ease of a low degree of compositionalityone could decide to assign meanings to combinations oftense and aspect forms, rather than to tense and aspectforms separately.6.
THE SYSTEM IN USEEurotra is a transfer based system.
The integration of thegiven analyses in the Eurotra framework has been achievedas follows.In analysis the tense and aspect forms are mapped ontotheir meanings.
This mapping is many-to-many and will,hence, result in  the assignment of many meanings to oneand the same form.
Disambiguation is done on the basisof the context.
Factors to be taken into account are thetemporal adverbials and the Aktionsart of the basic proposi-tion.In transfer the tense and aspect meanings are simplycopied: their representations are interlingual.In generation the meanings are mapped onto forms.
Unlikethe mapping in analysis, this mapping is a function.The system presented in this paper has been applied to thenine Eurotra languages and has been implemented in termsof the unification based Eurotra formalism.
Still lacking atthis moment are the treamaent of the transposed uses of thetenses and the rules for determining the Aktionsart of basicpropositions.REFERENCES ~Bennett Michael & Partee Barbara (1972), Toward the logicof tense and aspect in English.
