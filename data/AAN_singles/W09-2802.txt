Proceedings of the 2009 Workshop on Language Generation and Summarisation, ACL-IJCNLP 2009, page 3,Suntec, Singapore, 6 August 2009. c?2009 ACL and AFNLPQuery-focused Summarization Using Text-to-Text Generation:When Information Comes from Multilingual SourcesKathleen McKeownDepartment of Computer ScienceColumbia Universitykathy@cs.columbia.eduAbstractThe past five years have seen the emergence of robust, scalable natu-ral language processing systems that can summarize and answerquestions about online material.
One key to the success of such sys-tems is that they re-use text that appeared in the documents ratherthan generating new sentences from scratch.
Re-using text is abso-lutely essential for the development of robust systems; full semanticinterpretation of unrestricted text is beyond the state of the art.
Bettersummaries and answers can be produced, however, if systems cangenerate new sentences from the input text, fusing relevant phrasesand discarding irrelevant ones.
When the underlying sources forsummarization come from multiple languages, the need for text-to-text generation is even more pronounced.In this invited talk I present research on query-focused summariza-tion over a variety of sources, including news, broadcast news, talksshows and blogs.
Our research combines approaches from summari-zation and information extraction to answer open-ended questions.Because our sources include informal genres as well as formal genresand draw from English, Arabic and Chinese, text-to-text generation iscritical for improving the intelligibility of responses.
In our systems,we exploit information available at question answering time to editsentences, removing redundant and irrelevant information and cor-recting errors in translated sentences.3
