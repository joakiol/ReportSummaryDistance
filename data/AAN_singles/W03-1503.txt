For thisresearch, we are constructing a Japanese-English broadcast news corpus with NEtags.
The tags represent not only NEclass information but also coreference in-formation within the same monolingualdocument and between correspondingJapanese-English document pairs.
Anal-ysis of about 1,100 annotated article pairshas shown that if NE occurrence informa-tion, such as classes, number of occur-rence and occurrence order, is given foreach language, it may provide a good cluefor corresponding NEs across languages.1 IntroductionStudies on named entity (NE) extraction are mak-ing progress for various languages, such as En-glish and Japanese.
A number of evaluation work-shops have been held, including the Message Under-standing Conference (MUC)1 for English and otherlanguages, and the Information Retrieval and Ex-traction Exercise (IREX)2 for Japanese.
Extractionaccuracy for English has reached a nearly practi-cal level (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1998).
As forJapanese, it is more difficult to find NE bound-1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related_projects/muc/2http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/irex/aries, however, NE extraction is relatively accurate(Sekine and Isahara, 2000).Most of the past research on NE extraction usedmonolingual corpora, but the application of NE ex-traction techniques to bilingual (or multilingual) cor-pora is expected to obtain NE translation pairs.
Weare developing a Japanese-English machine trans-lation system for documents including many NEs,such as news articles or documents about currenttopics.
Translating NE correctly is indispensable forconveying information correctly.
NE translations,however, are not listed in conventional dictionaries.It is necessary to retrieve NE translation knowledgefrom the latest bilingual documents.When extracting translation knowledge frombilingual corpora, using literally translated parallelcorpora, such as official documents written in sev-eral languages makes it easier to get the desired in-formation.
However, not many of such corpora con-tain the latest NEs.
There are few Japanese-Englishcorpora which are translated literally.
Therefore,we decided to extract NE translation pairs fromcontent-aligned corpora, such as multilingual broad-cast news articles including new NEs daily, whichare not literally translated.Sentential alignment (Brown et al, 1991; Galeand Church, 1993; Kay and Ro?scheisen, 1993; Ut-suro et al, 1994; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996) iscommonly used as a starting point for finding thetranslations of words or expressions from bilingualcorpora.
However, it is not always possible to cor-respond non-parallel corpora in sentences.
Past sta-tistical methods for non-parallel corpora (Fung andYee, 1998) are not valid for finding translations ofwords or expressions with low frequency.
Thesemethods have a problem in covering NEs becausethere are many NEs that appear only once in a cor-pus.
So we need a specialized method for extract-ing NE translation pairs.
Transliteration is used forfinding the translations of NE in the source languagefrom texts in the target language (Stalls and Knight,1998; Goto et al, 2001; Al-Onazian and Knight,2002).
Transliteration is useful for the names of per-sons and places; however, it is not applicable to allsorts of NEs.Content-aligned documents, such as a bilingualnews corpus, are made to convey the same top-ics.
Since NEs are the essential element of docu-ment contents, content-aligned documents are likelyto share NEs pointing to the same objects.
Con-sequently, when extracting all NEs with NE classinformation from each of a pair of bilingual docu-ments separately by applying monolingual NE ex-traction techniques, the distribution of the NEs ineach document may be similar enough to recognizecorrespondences between the NE translation pairs.A technique for finding bilingual NE correspon-dences will have a wide range of applications otherthan NE translation-pair extraction.
For example,?
Bilingual NE correspondences have clues foridentifying corresponding parts in a pair ofnoisy bilingual documents.?
The similarity of any two documents in dif-ferent languages can be estimated by NEtranslation-pair correspondence.For this research, we obtained a Japanese-Englishbroadcast news corpus (Kumano et al, 2002) bythe Japanese broadcast company NHK3, and we aremanually tagging NEs in the corpus to analyze itand to conduct NE translation-pair extraction exper-iments.The tag specifications are based on the IREXNE task (Sekine and Isahara, 1999), the evaluationworkshop of Japanese NE extraction.
We extendedthe specifications to English NEs.
In addition, coref-erence information between NEs, within the samemonolingual document and between the correspond-ing Japanese-English document pairs (henceforth,3Nippon Hoso Kyokai (Japan Broadcasting Corporation)(http://www.nhk.or.jp/englishtop/)we call these in a language and across languages,respectively), is added to each of the tagged NEs,for NE translation-pair extraction studies.In Section 2, we will introduce the bilingual cor-pus used in this study and describe its characteris-tics.
Then, we will discuss tag design for NE extrac-tion studies, and explain the tag specifications andexisting problems.
The current status of corpus an-notation under these specifications will also be in-troduced.
We analyzed an annotated part of the cor-pus in terms of NE occurrence and translation.
Thisanalysis will be shown in Section 3.
In Section 4,we will mention future plans for the extraction ofNE translation-pairs.2 Constructing a Japanese-Englishbroadcast news corpus with NE tags2.1 Characteristics of the NHKJapanese-English broadcast news corpusWe are annotating an NHK broadcast news corpuswith NE tags.
The corpus is composed of Japanesenews articles for domestic programs and Englishnews articles translated for international broadcast-ing4 and domestic bilingual programs5.Figure 1 shows an example of a Japanese newsarticle and its translation in English.
The originalJapanese article and the translated English articledeal with the same topic, but they differ much in de-tails.
The difference arises from the following rea-sons (Kumano et al, 2002).Audience Content might be added or deleted, ac-cording to the audience, especially for interna-tional broadcasting.Broadcasting date The broadcasting of Englishnews is often delayed compared to the origi-nal Japanese news.
The time expressions mightbe changed sometimes or new facts might beadded to the articles.News styles / languages Comparing news articlesof two languages reveals that they have differ-ent presentation styles, for example, facts aresometimes introduced in a different order.
The4NHK WORLD (http://www.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/)5http://www.nhk.or.jp/englishtop/program_list/Original article in Japanese (and its literal translation in English by authors):1: ????????????????????????????????????????????????

The specifications are shown below.?
It is desirable that NE recognition guidelinesbe consistent with NE tags of existing corpora.Past guidelines of MUC and IREX should berespected because they were configured as a re-sult of many discussions.
Consistent guidelinesenable us to utilize existing annotated corporaand systems designated for the corpora.?
Within each bilingual document pair, corefer-ence between NEs in a language and across lan-guages will be specified.
When several NEsexist for the same referent in a document, itis not always possible to determine the actualtranslation for each instance of the NEs fromthe counterpart document, because our corpusis not composed of literal translations.
There-fore, coreference between NEs in a languageshould be marked so that the coreference acrosslanguages can be assigned between NE groupsthat have the same referent.
Coreference be-tween NE groups is sufficient for our purpose.?
Assignment of coreference in a language is lim-ited between NEs only.
Although NEs mayhave the same referent with pronouns or non-NE expressions, these elements are ignored toavoid complicating the annotation work.2.3 Tag specifications1.
The tag specifications conform to IREX NEtag specifications (IREX Committee, 1999) (anEnglish description in (Sekine and Isahara,1999)) as regards the markup form, NE classes,and NE recognition guidelines.Japanese:???????

the same 7 classes as MUC-7 (3 typesof named entities in the narrow sense, 2 typesof temporal expressions, and 2 types of numberexpressions), and ARTIFACT (concrete objectslike commercial products and abstract objectssuch as laws or intellectual properties).
Table 1shows a list of these.2.
IREX?s NE classes and NE recognition guide-lines are applied to English for consistency be-tween Japanese and English NEs.
For English-specific annotation, such as prepositions or de-terminers in NE, the MUC-7 Named EntityTask Definition (Chinchor, 1997) is consulted6.3.
The SGML markup form of the IREX tag isextended by adding the following two tag at-tributes, which represent coreference informa-tion in a language, and across languages.ID=?NE group ID?
(mandatory)Each NE is assigned an attribute ID andan ID number as its value.
All corefer-ent NEs in each language document are6The tag specifications of IREX NE and those of MUC-7 donot differ radically, because IREX NE tags are designed basedon the discussions of MUC.given the same ID number7.
The sameID number is assigned to NEs that havedifferent forms, such as the full name andthe first name or the official name and theabbreviated form, in addition to NEs withthe same form.
Basically, NE are assignedthe same ID number when they belong toan NE class and have the identical surfaceform8.COR=?ID for corresponding NE groups inthe other language?
(optional)When there exists a corresponding NE(group) belonging to the same NE classin the other language, an attribute CORis given to each NE (group) in both lan-guages, and the ID number for the coun-terpart is assigned as a value to each other.Annotations by the specifications are illustratedin Figure 2.2.4 Current status of the corpus annotationAnnotators who have experience in translation workand in the production of linguistic data are engagingin the tag annotation.
Plans call for a total of 2,000article pairs to be annotated, and about 1,100 pairshave been finished up to the present.2.5 ProblemsSome problems became obvious in the course ofdiscussions of tag specifications and tag annotationwork.
They confuse annotators and make the resultinaccurate.
Typical cases are shown below.2.5.1 The granularity difference betweenJapanese and EnglishIn Japanese, a unit smaller than a morpheme maybe accepted as an NE according to IREX guidelines.7ID numbers do not maintain uniqueness across the docu-ments.8There are some exceptions.
See Section 2.5.3.

?<DATE ID=?1?>??</DATE>???
?<DATE ID=?2?>?
?</DATE>E: <DATE COR=?1?>last Sunday</DATE> and <DATE COR=?2?>this Sunday</DATE>Figure 3: Assignment of different group IDs with NEs having the same surface formOn the other hand, English does not accept any unitsmaller than a word by MUC-7 guidelines.
SomeJapanese NEs cannot have a counterpart EnglishNE, even if they have a corresponding English ex-pression because of the difference in the segmenta-tion granularity.
For example, ?????
(amerika;America)?
in the Japanese morpheme ??????
(amerika-jin; America-people)?
is treated as an NE,while no NE can be tagged to ?American?, the En-glish counterpart of ??????.
?2.5.2 Translation problemsNEs have the same problem that translation ingeneral has: What is the exact translation word(s)for an expression??
Semantically corresponding expressions maynot be assigned corresponding NE relations,because they belong to different NE classes oran expression in a language is not recognizedas an NE.
For example, a non-NE word ???
(seifu; government)?
which means Japanesegovernment in Japanese articles is often trans-lated as the English NE: ?Japan.??
A non-literal translation of an NE may causedifficulty in recognizing corresponding rela-tions.
Correspondences for some expressionscannot be decided with the information repre-sented in documents: Relative temporal expres-sions in Japanese are often translated as ab-solute expressions in English and those corre-spondences cannot be identified without con-sulting the calendar; Money expressions aregenerally converted to dollars and the ex-change rate at the relative time is needed toconfirm correspondences.
For example, wefound a translation pair of money expressions?????
(sanzen-oku-en; three hundred bil-lion yen)?
and ?three billion U-S dollars?
in ourcorpus, which constitutes a rough conversionfrom yen into dollars when the articles wereproduced.2.5.3 Assigning NE group IDsWe defined NEs that have the identical surfaceform and the same NE class to be coreferent andassigned the same NE group ID, in order to makecoreference judgment easier.
There are some caseswhere we cannot apply this rule, especially to tem-poral expressions or number expressions.The example in Figure 3 shows the translationpair ????????????
(last Sunday and thisSunday)?
and ?last Sunday and this Sunday?
anno-tated with NE tags.
Japanese temporal expressions??????
(last Sunday)?
and ??????
(thisSunday)?
are translated into English as ?last Sun-day?
and ?this Sunday?
respectively.
When anno-tating NE tags for this translation pair, only ???(Sunday)?
in those temporal expressions in Japaneseis regarded as an NE according to the IREX?s NEspecifications.
This causes a problem in which thetwo NEs of the same surface form that are assignedthe same NE class have different referents.
Each ofthem should assign correspondence to different NEsin the counterpart: the former to ?last Sunday?
andthe latter to ?this Sunday.
?Tentatively, we allowed a different NE group ID tobe assigned to an NE with the identical surface formin an NE class, as shown in Figure 3.
It would bebetter reexamine the consistency of the NE tag spec-ification between Japanese and English, and the ne-cessity of coreference information for temporal ex-pressions and number expressions.3 AnalysisWe conducted an elementary investigation into1,096 pairs of annotated Japanese and English ar-ticles.3.1 Corpus sizeTable 2 shows the content size of our corpus bythe number of sentences and the morphemes/words.The content decreases significantly when translatingfrom Japanese to English.

The distribution of NE classes isalmost the same as that in the data for MUC-7 orIREX.By comparing the decrease in content (cf.
Ta-ble 2), the number of NE tokens also decreases fortranslations.
However, the degree of the NE de-crease is less than that of the morphemes/words.
Itis also remarkable that the number of NE types isfairly well preserved.
Notice that only a small num-ber of tokens in the NE class TIME appear in En-glish.
The reason may be that detailed time infor-mation may become less important for English ar-ticles, which are intended for audiences outside ofJapan and broadcast later than the original Japanesearticles.3.2.2 NE characteristics within NE groupsTo examine the surface form distribution in thesame NE groups, we counted the number of mem-bers ( freq) and sorts of surface form (sort) for eachNE group in each article.

2).Table 4 shows the values averaged for all the NEgroups that appeared in all articles.In English, a repetition of the same expression isnot conventionally desirable.
Therefore, pronounsor paraphrases are used frequently.
On the otherhand, Japanese does not have such a convention.This difference is considered to be the reason for theresult shown in Table 4: freq in English is smallerthan that in Japanese, and sort in English is largerthan that in Japanese.
As a result, uniq in English ishigher than that in Japanese.
These tendencies differslightly according to the NE classes.?
The sort of English PERSON is notably large.
InEnglish, the name of a person is usually first ex-pressed in full, and after that, it tends to be ex-pressed only by the family name.
In Japanese,only the family name is generally used from thebeginning, especially for well-known persons.NE classJ?

An NE occurring more timesin an article may have more important informationand is more likely to appear in the translation.3.3.2 Preservation of NE orderWe investigated how well the order of NEs oc-curring in an article is preserved in the counterpartlanguage as follows:1.
In every article, we eliminated all NEs exceptthe first occurrence of every NE group.2.
We calculated the ratio between all of the pos-sible NE pairs in the source language and thosetranslated into the target language with thesame order of occurrence.Table 7 lists the average preservation ratios of theNE order for all NEs (?All?)
and for NEs havingcorresponding NEs in the counterpart (?Corr.
only?
).The scores labeled ?All NEs?
express ratios for theorder of all NEs.
The preservation ratio for eachNE class is listed below in the table.
The NE or-ders are preserved so well even for all NEs that theycan be used for determining cross-language corre-spondences.4 ConclusionIn this paper, in which we aimed to acquire NE trans-lation knowledge, we described our construction ofa Japanese-English broadcast news corpus with NEtags for NE translation-pair extraction.
The tags rep-resent NE characteristics and coreference informa-tion in a language and across languages.
Analysisof the annotated 1,097 article pairs has shown thatif NE occurrence information, such as classes, num-ber of occurrences and occurrence order, is given foreach language side, it may provide a good clue fordetermining NE correspondence across languages.Our future plans are listed below.?
The problems in Section 2.5 need to be reex-amined from the point of view of what infor-mation bilingual corpora should have for NEtranslation-pair extraction research.?
The proposed analysis in Section 3 pointed outthat identifying coreferences in a language isvery important for achieving NE translation-pair extraction.
Richer coreference informationshould be annotated in our corpus for coref-erence identification studies.
We are planningto annotate coreference information for pro-nouns and some other non-NE expressions, re-ferring to the MUC-7 coreference task defini-tion (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997).?
Corpora with different characteristics, such as abilingual newspaper corpus, will be annotatedand analyzed.Acknowledgments This research was supportedin part by the Telecommunications AdvancementOrganization of Japan.ReferencesYaser Al-Onazian and Kevin Knight.
