Prediction of Vowel and Consonant Place of ArticulationRen6 Carr6 and Maria ModyDrpartement Signal, Unit6 Associre au CNRS,ENSTcarre@ sig.enst.fr, mody @ sig.enst.frAbstractA deductive approach is used to predict voweland consonant places of articulation.
Based ontwo main criteria, viz.
simple and efficient use ofan acoustic tube, along with maximum acousticdispersion, the Distinctive Regions Model(DRM) of speech production derives regionsthat closely correspond to established vowel andconsonant places of articulation.1 IntroductionAttempts to explain speech production data often sufferfrom circularity.
That is, the classification of data tendsto be purely descriptive without shedding light on theprocesses that give rise to them.
In criticizing the data-based approach, Lindblom (1990) favors, instead, theuse of substance-based approaches.
Here, deductionsare derived from specific criteria or from characteristicsof the speech production and/or perceptual systems inorder to explain the data.
In fact, researcher havesuccessfully exploited the substance-based approach inexplaining vowel systems, using a perceptually-drivenmaximum acoustic dispersion criterion (Liljencrantsand Lindblom, 1972; Lindblorn, 1986).
But thisapproach, too, may be thought of as being circular, tosome extent, in that the criterion used may be viewedas, merely, a more encompassing description of thevowels themselves.
The crucial task then is to explainthe characteristics of the speech perception/productionsystem itself.
For example, what is it about the humanspeech apparatus that yields three and not four or fiveplaces of articulation?
Is the vocal tract designedprimarily for feeding or does it reflect adaptationsspecialized for speech?
To answer some of thesequestions, we undertook to investigate whatdeformations (i.e.
vocal tract configurations/shapes) ofa simple acoustic tube, open at one end and closed atthe other, and modeled after a male vocal tract, willyield (i) a good acoustic ommunication device, and (ii)an acoustic repertoire that closely matches the phoneticrichness of human speech.2 Criteria for building an acoustic device forcommunicationOur approach will be based purely on physical lawsand communication theory principles, and not on anyspecific characteristics of the human production and/orperception systems.
The acoustic device is shown inFig.1.
It is a closed-open tube corresponding to thevocal folds at one end and to the lip opening at theother, respectively.
Commands deform the area functionof the acoustic tube consequently producing changes inthe acoustic signal.
These commands constitute ourphonological repertoire and may be viewed asanalogous to the 'gestures' proposed by Browman andGoldstein (1989).Commands AcousticLexical 1(5, 6, 7) I Isignal (1)memory (8) \] : Acoustic tube IArticulatory-acousticrelation (2, 3, 4)Figure 1.
Acoustic device deformed by commands.The criteria used to buildcommunication device are the following:?
acoustic contrast: maximization ofa 'good'the acousticcontrast of the sounds produced (1) in order to havea good signal-to-noise ratio.
The spectral peaks(formants) having maximum energy are retained asacoustic parameters;?
least effort: this refers to the efficiency of thearticulatory-acoustic relations (2) with monotonicity(3) and orthogonality (4) of the relations.
The use ofan efficiency criterion corresponds to increasing therole of the dynamics;?
simplicity: with respect to the commands of thedeformation of the acoustic tube, the commandsmust be simple J(5) (straight deformations), few innumber (6), and with a reduced number of degrees (a)of constriction (7).
This is based on the assumptionthat fewer commands make for smaller demands onmemory resources (8) that may be engaged in thelearning and eventual mastery of these commands inthe phonological cquisition process.An algorithm to automatically and efficientlydeform the area function of an acoustic tube in order toincrease or decrease the frequency of a formant orcombination of several formants has been proposedelsewhere Carr6 et  al.
(1994; 1995).
As an example,figure 2 shows the automatic evolution of the area (b)function of the tube from a closed-open neutralconfiguration, for increasing and decreasing F2.Four main regions naturally emerge which arenot of equal length.
The /a/ vowel is an automaticconsequence of a back constriction associated with afront cavity, and, the/ i /vowel of a front constrictionassociated with a back cavity (anti-symmetricalbehavior), a pharynx cavity, thus, being automaticallyobtained.
If, however, the initial configuration is that ofa tube closed at both ends (i.e.
closed-closed) the/u/ (c)vowel is automaiicaUy obtained with a centralconstriction (symmetrical behavior).
A summary of themain conclusions that may be drawn from the abovemanipulations are as following:?
configurations using the maximum acoustic ontrastcriterion correspond to those for the three vowels/a,i, u/of  the vowe\[ triangle;?
the deformation of the tube is minimum, because ofthe use of the sensitivity function (Fant and Pauli,1974) and thus efficient; (d)?
the deformation 'commands (or gestures) are simple(recti-linear), limited in number (only one in the caseof figure 2, for the making of a back constriction isautomatically as~sociated with a front cavity andvice-versa, as i 9 human), and applied at specificplaces called distinctive regions.

(c)-(d) Corresponding three formant variations andformant rajectories in the F,-F2 plane (lower part).=,7In summary, characteristics important andintegral to a 'good' acoustic communication devicewere obtained when an acoustic tube underwentspecific deformations.
It is this type of tube, so-structured in regions, that forms the basis of theDistinctive Region Model (DRM) (Carr6 and Mrayati,1992; Mrayati, et al, 1988).
Deformation gestures andefficient places of deformation (the regions) are thusdeduced from acoustic theory.3 The Distinctive Region Model (DRM)The DRM model proposed in 1988 (Mrayati, et al,1988) is structured in regions, the limits of whichcorrespond to the zero-crossings of the sensitivityfunction computed on a uniform closed-open tube(figure 3).The DRM is a 2-region model when only thefirst formant is controlled.
It is a 4-region model whenthe first two formants (F~ and F2) are controlled (notethat this 4-region structure is automatically obtainedwith a maximum acoustic contrast algorithm - seefigure 2).
It is an 8-region model when the first threeformants (F~, F2, F3) are controlled.
Thus, increasedcontrol of the number of formants entails an increase incomplexity and topological accuracy.
Varying thecross-sectional rea of any one region maximizes theformant frequency variations, with each binarycombination of a positive or negative formant variationcorresponding to a specific region.
Thus, it ishypothesized that the regions of the model couldrepresent the best places of articulation for vowels andconsonants.Critics of this model, may claim that definingregions from the sensitivity functions for a uniform tubeAF F~ would limit the functioning domain for smalll perturbations.
But synergetic ommand of the regionsallows one to maintain monotonic formant variations aswell as the region structure, as shown in figure 2.PI I I -  I I II\ t  / \ I \ F.;\ x l  I \ \ t l F :\ l _ l t l F ,Figure 3.

The limits of the 8 regions ofthe DRM model correspond to the zero-crossings of thesensitivity functions (central part).

Vocal tract (from Perkell (1969)) and theeight regions of the model.Note that the region boundaries correspond to apercentage of the total length of the tube.
Since thephysical ength of the acoustic tube is around 19.5 cmfor the vowel /u/ and 17.5 cm for the vowel /i/, theplace of articulation would thus move according to thepronounced vowel.
However, it is the 'effective' lengththat one must take into account ; for, in addition to thephysical ength, Lp, effective length incorporates thelength, Lr, which corresponds to the radiation effect.Now then, Lr is imore or less proportional to the lipopening.
For the vowel/i/, Lr=2 cm, and for the vowel/u/, Lr=0 cm.
Thus the effective length remains almostconstant (Mrayat i, et al, 1990) and the places ofarticulation, fixe& with region 7 always correspondingto the teeth (figure 4).
Region 8 (with the radiationeffect) corresponds tothe lips, regions 3, 4, 5, 6 to thetongue, the region 1 to the larynx.
Regions 2 and 7, ofsmall ength, are acoustically unimportant.As such, a closed-open model may not beemployed for an/u/production because the vocal tractis closed at the source and more or less closed at thelips.
A closed-close.d model would be more convenient.The behavior of such a model is symmetrical, allowingfor a central constriction to be automatically derived(Carr6 and Mrayati, 1992).front constrictioncentral c o ~ t i o ~ ~  ~ ~"back ' / ~ - \ [  R6 ~7~8const@tion 7 / ~  K5 ~ / l- - I  / ~/d/closureR3 /g/closureR2RiFigure 5.

For consonant production, the8-region model is needed (taking into account he firstthree formants).
Thus, prediction of consonantproduction requires amore complex model than that forthe vowel production (insofar as the number of degreesof constriction is not taken into account).4 Vowel  p laces  o f  a r t i cu la t ionThe DRM model with its places of articulation wasused to produce vowels.
For example, figure 6 showsthe execution of a command (using a closed-open DRMmodel) to pass from a front constriction to a backconstriction along with a labial command.
The acousticresults of these commands are also shown in the FrFzplane.
The positions of the vowels obtained with such aclosed-open model are given.
Thus, to produce vowelsthe first two formants appear to be sufficient, the thirdone either being deduced from the first two (Ladefogedand Harshman, 1979) or is a speaker specificcharacteristic (Boulogne, et al, 1973).I-from front to backconstriction- lJl b3000200010000F2(Hz)from front to back+lab _\[i\] ~ constrictionF,(m)I I I IThe places: of articulation predicted by themodel as the bes~t places for maximum formantvariations are represented in figure 5.
It can beobserved that the three main places of articulation forrvowel production may be predicted with the 4-regionmodel (taking into account he first two formants).
Theclosed-open model predicts the front constriction andthe back constriction; the closed-closed model predicts1~ 3~ 5~ 7~ 9~Figure 6.

The trajectory/uf/ was obtained with a central constriction (closed-closed model).The consequences of a change from a closed-open to a closed-closed configuration of the DRMmodel have been studied elsewhere (for more details,see Carr6 and Mrayati (1995)).
Intermediate places ofarticulation between central and back and central andfront are obtained.
This approach allows for a goodprediction of vocalic systems (Cart6, 1996).5 Consonant places of articulationFigure 7 shows the formant variations associated withclosing and opening of the eight regions of the DRMmodel with its uniform configuration.
Using the placesof articulation defined by this model (taking intoaccount the first three formants), we were able to obtainthe formant transitions measured by Ohman (1966)(Carri and Chennoukh, 1995).
The use of the region 7gives rise to the production of consonants perceived aslabial.
Thus, the classification proposed by Mrayati etal.
(1988, figure 18) has been revised.
Considering thevowel/El as close to the neutral partly contributed tothe misclassification.

The regions 3 and 4 of the back part of themodel correspond to the places of articulation ofpharyngeal p osives (AI Dakkak, et al, 1994).. .

Variations of the first three formantscorresponding to a closing-opening gesture in a specificregion.Since the regions of the DRM model can beobtained from the formant variations of a uniform tubeand since these regions indeed correspond to the placesof articulation, we may hypothesize the following:?
the bursts (Blumstein and Stevens, 1979; Stevensand Blumstein, 1981) associated with the plosivesare consequences of closure-opening actions.
Indeed,it has beeen shown that if the bursts are important,they are not determinant for plosive identification icomparison with the formant transitions (Kewley-Port and Pisoni, 1983; Walley and Carrell, 1983).?
the fricative consonants which are generallycharacterized by their noise sources and not by theirforrnant ransitions have to be studied according toanother criterion.?
the third formant may be essential for differentiatingcertain consonants l ike/d/and/g/ ( the slopes of thefirst and second forrnant would not be sufficient).Indeed, it is noted in Harris et al (1958) that theconsonant /d/ cannot be obtained in the vocaliccontext /i/ without the third formant.
The authorsconcluded that << The effects of third formant cuesare independent of the two-formant patterns towhich they are added.
When a third formant cueenhances the perception of a particular phoneme, ittypically does not do so equally at the expense of theother response alternatives >>.
Similarly, incategorical perception experiments, Godfrey et al(1981) studied the boundary between/d /and/g /bychanging the rate and direction of the third formantonly, while the first two formants were changed fora/b/-/d/contrast.
Additional experiments have to beundertaken tofurther explore this point.?
the use of a uniform tube allowed for allcombinations of formant variations (positive andnegative), that form the basis of the DRM structure,to be revealed.
Does this imply that perceptualidentification is carried out with reference to auniform state?
This point is worth studying further.6 ConclusionsThe main places of articulation for vowels and plosiveconsonants can be predicted from a criterion ofefficiency of articulatory-acoustic relations.
Forvowels, a 4-region model (taking into account he firsttwo formants) is needed, and for the plosiveconsonants, an 8-region model (taking into account hefirst three formants).
This has important implication forthe role of complexity in the production of vowelsversus consonants.3oIf the regions 5, 6, 8 are the best places for R.maximum formant variations (maximum dynamicacoustic contrast)fin the case of non-nasal closure-opening, how does: one explain the production of nasalconsonant having the same places of articulation?
For R.nasal consonants, !it is not evident hat the maximumdynamic ontrasts are preserved.
Perhaps, simplicity ofproduction (same iplaces of articulation) may be thecriterion if the dynamic acoustic more important E.

contrasts are sufficient?
Additional experiments have to R.be undertaken to l know if this apparently optimalacoustic behavior: of the human speech apparatusrepresents adaptat!ons specialized for communication,i.e., is it a consequence of communication theory R.(ecological point of view) or is it just a coincidence?
Isit that speech is just an overlaid function on a systemdesigned primarily for feeding?
The answer to thisquestion will determine the importance and validity ofour deductions.
R.In summary, the DRM model uses as its basicelements, control commands, that allow one to deducethe places of articulation for vowels and consonantsthereby uncovering the physical bases of phonological R.distinctions.
Furthermore, speech synthesis using thismodel have yielded high quality results (Hill, et al,1995).ReferencesO.
