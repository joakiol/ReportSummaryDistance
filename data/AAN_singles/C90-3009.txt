Syllable-based MorphologyLynne J. Cahil l*School  of Cogni t ive  and Comput ing  SciencesUn ivers i ty  of SussexBr ighton  BN1 9QHEng landAbst rac tThis paper presents a language for the description ofmorphological lternations which is based on sylla-ble structure.
The justification for such an approachis discussed with reference to examples fi'om a va-riety of languages and the approach is compared toKoskenniemi's two-level account of morphonoIogy.Keywords :  morphology, phonology, syllables.1 In t roduct ionThe field of computational morphology was revolu-tionized by the work of Kfimno Koskenniemi (198a,1984), whose two-level model of lnorphonology ha.sbeen used for the description of several languages,including English, French, Finnish and Japanese.
Itis attractive computationally, being based on finitestate transducers.
However, we shall argue that, al-though FSTs are good at ma.pping strings of symbolsonto strings of symbols, morphological representa-tion is tree-like rather than string-like.Work on computational morphology can roughlybe divided into Koskenniemi-type models, which givean account of phonological (or orthographical) alter-nations, but which pay less attention to morphologi-cal aspects, such as inheritance; and inheritance-typemodels, which do the opposite - ignoring phonologi-cal aspects.The latter includes lexical representation lan-guages which provide as output objects like:1.

(>>REFERENT(APPEND(APPEND \[STRING "werk"\])OF PAST-PARTICIPLE-SUFFIX))OF PAST-PARTICIPLE-PREFIX))\[Daetemans, t987, p.40\]Work of this kind thus opens a gap which needs tobe filled - namely a means of defining such morpho-logical fimctions a.s umlaut and su~xation.The a.im of the work described here is 1;o pro-vide a formal language for describing (in phonologi-cal terms) those morphological lternations that areto be found in natural anguages.Section 2 will discuss the approach to morphol-ogy being advocated here, in particular contrastingit with Koskenniemi's approach, and explaining whyconcepts from non-linear phonologies may be usefulto morphology.
Section 3 will present he languageitself, and some examples of how it may be appliedto natural anguage alternations will be discussed inSection 4.2 The  ApproachKoskenniemi's model divides the morphological pro-cessor into two elements - the FST which handles(mor)phonologicM alternations by matching lexicaland surface forms, and a system of mini-lexicons,which handle the concatenation of morphemes tomake words.
While this system has been shown towork with a nulnber of languages, and while its con>putationM simplicity makes it very attractive, such amodel forces one to make a rather radical distinctionbetween, say, suflixation and a modification functionsuch as unfiaut.
Furthermore, the model is concernedwith strings of segments - that is, it does not a.l-low one to make any reference to entities above thelevel of the segment (syllables, feet, etc.
), except bythe use of rather awkward boundary diacritics.
Thisis in contrast with much recent lit~guistic work onphonology, which i~w.

(see e.g.
Liberman & Prince, 1976, Du-rand,1986.
)That there is some interaction between the pro-cesses of phonology and those of morphology can bereadily seen by looking at an example from Matthews(1974).
The Latin verb alternations ' eribo' (I write)and 'scripsi' (I wrote) apparently involve both.
Theaddition of the '-s-' in the past tense form is purelymorphological, while the alteration of the /b /  to a/p / ,  while it could again be morphological, could alsobe accounted for by natural phonological processeswhich operate in other morphological environments,as a ease of voicing assimilation, with the voicing fea-ture of the/b/ass imi lat ing to that of the /s / to  giveIpl.With this in mind, it is no surprise that the typesof functions which can occur in morphology are gemerally similar to phonological processes and oftenrequire reference to at least a. subset of those con-cepts required for the description of phonologicalphenomena.
(Indeed , many morphological functionsare phonological functions which have become "fos-silized" in the morphology after the disappearanceof the phonological conditioning context.)
Kosken-niemi's model was strictly segmental and used onlymonadic phones and phonenaes, rather than featurebundles.
The present work proposes that tree struc-tures to the level of the syllable are required formorphological description, as well as feature bun-dies.
The motivation comes from examples uch asthe English stressed syllable shift as in pairs like/kon'vikt/--/'konvikt/, and pairs distinguished by asingle feature, such as the voicing feature in / te l l : f / -/reli:v/.The present work aims to provide a languagetot defining morphological fimctions using tree-structures, feature bundles and concepts from non-linear phonologies.
It assumes the existence of a lex-ical representation language like those in Section 1above, although the exact nature of that languagehas no bearing on the language presented here.3 The LanguageMOLUSC 1, the formal language presented here, isa declarative language based on the concept of thesyllable and hence it embodies the clai,n that all thefunctions used in morphology can be defined in termsof syllables and subsyllabic onstituents.
A syllablestructure as in Figure 1 is assumed, where the onsetand coda consist of consonants and the peak consistsof vowels.
(The onset a.nd coda may optionally beempty.
)The existence of a rhyme constituent is not entirelyuncontroversial (see Clements and Keyser, 1983),1 Morphological Operations Language Using Syllabic-basedConstructssyllonset rhymepeak codaFigure 1: Syllable structurebut is nonetheless widely accepted by linguists andits role in morphological description can be seen bylooldng at the English verb alternations, "bring" -"brought", "think" -"thought" etc., in which therhyme constituent in the past tense form is always/w/  (assmning that the / t / i s  a past tense suffix).A stem ~" consists of a sequence of syllables, withoutany further structure between the level of syllableand stem.. A disyllabic stein, such as /beg in /  wouldtherefore have the structure in Figure 2 (over).It should be noted that this analysis is distinctfrom most non-linear phonologies, which postulatefllrther levels of structure between the syllable andthe stem, such as metrical feet.
We maintain thatthese fllrther levels of analysis are not necessary formorphological description, although this is not todeny their role in phonological description.With this kind of structure, we still need some wayof referring to particular syllables within the stem,or segments within the peak, onset and coda.
Weachieve this by means of a simple numbering con-vention, where +N refers to the Nth element fromthe left, and -N refers to the Nth element from theright.
In addition, +0 refers to the pre-initial po-sition with respect to a sequence of nodes, and -Orefers to the post-final position.
This latter conven-tion is intended primarily for pre- and suffixation.MOLUSC contains one basic operation, substitu-tion.
Conceptually, this means that affixation fimc-tions are regarded as substitutions of null elementswith non-null elements, and deletion functions ("sub-traction" in Matthews, 1974) vice versa.
A substitu-tion is expressed in the following form:\[LtlS ~ RItS\]where LIIS is an expression which specifies the nodeof a tree which is to be replaced and PdtS is an ex-pression which specifies the subtree which is to re-place it.
The above function template consists of asingle rule (LItS =~ RHS), each rule defining a sub-stitution.
All alternations are defined in terms of2We use the word stem to refer to any word-form; this is notintended to carry any implications about the nature or role ofthe object in question, but is mcrcly a relatively neutral wordfor referring to objects above the lcvel of the syllable.49sternonsetbsyllrhymepeak codaI Ie 0onsetIgsyllrhymepeak codai nFigure 2: /begin/functions on trees, so tl{at a substitution involvesthe replacement of a single node in the tree togetherwith all its daughters, with another node and all itsdaughters.The LtIS of the function is an expression consistingof a structurally unique mother category, a numericalargument indicating tile syllable, and a numericalargument indicating the segment (the last two beingoptional with certain restrictions).
This gives objectssuch as the following:(stem, +1) - the first syllable.
( rhyme,-1)  - the rhyme of the finalsyllable.
(coda, +1, -1 )  - the final segment of thecoda of the firstsyllable.The LI1S of the function can also be qualified withadditional phonological information, such as:(coda,+l,-1)/d/(coda,+l,-1)\[+,voice\]which say respectively that the final segment of thecoda of the final syllable must be /d /o r  must havethe feature \[+, voice\] for the function to have anyeffect.
(In the event of any of the conditions fail-ing, the identity functions applies, so that a functionalways applies although it may not have any effect.
)The P~HS n'lay be a description of a completephonological object (i.e.
a tree) or a feature set,.
Sinceall node names are assumed to be abbreviations forfeature sets, a substitution of a feature set involvessimply the substitution of some subset of features inthe set.The RIIS may also consist of variables, indicatedby upper case letters, which are bound to parts ofthe input.
This is needed for reduplication functions,which require the a.ttixation of some element (usuallya syllable) which is the sarne as some part of thestern.The tree-structured phonological representationsare expressed with punctuation marks - -  a pe-riod separates the three terminal groups, onset,peak and coda, a semicolon separates yllables andcommas separate the segments within a terminalgroup.
Thus, the representation for /begin/ wouldbe/b.e.;g.
i .n/ .
All phonological objects, whether asinput to the function or as a subtree to be substi-tuted in within a flmction must have their structurespecified in this way.In addition to tile qualifications which the LHSmay have, any number of conditions may be placedon the input tree.
A function which has conditionstakes the form,\[LItS ~ I~I~S :C\]where the : behaves like the context slash / stan-dardly used in phonology and C is any number ofconditions.
Each condition takes the same form asthe LHS with qualifications, and may be combinedas conjunctions (linked with commas) or disjunctions(linked with colnmas within curly braces {}).
Thus,we may define a flmction which adds a suf f ix / .u .
/only if the final syllable has the feature \[+,light\] (theplural suffixation to nouns in Old English),\ [ (stem,-0) ~ /.u.
/  : (stem,-1)\[+,l ight\]  \]In many cases, more than one Nnction needs tohe applied, and the ways in which the flmctions arecombined can be crucial.
There are three possiblesituations:?
where one function must apply before another?
where two functions must apply simultaneously?
where two functions do not interact and so mayapply in either order or simultaneously and yieldthe same result.The first case is handled with composite applica-tion of functions.
By composite application we mean50 3the application of functions combined with functioncomposition, denoted by o, as standardly used.
(Seeexample of Latin reduplication below.
)For the second case we use conjoint application, in-dicated by &, which may apply to whole flmctions,or to rules within flmctions.
Thus, we may have twoalternations which both require the same conditions.For example, the Austronesian language Rotumanexhibits morphological metathesis, with alternationslike / t i ko / -  / t iok/ ,  / fupa/  - / fuap/ .
This can bedefined as a swapping of the onset and coda of thefinal syllable with the use of variables, but the vari-ables must both be instantiated before either of thefunctions apply.
We can define this using conjointapplication of rules (where a rule is LIIS ::> RItS)within a single flmction, e.g.meta = \[(onset,-1) => /C /&  (coda,-1) =>/O/:(coda,-1)/C/,(onset,-1)/O /1where O and C are variables which are bound toparts of the input, in this case, the onset and codaof the finM syllable respectively.There are two types of situation which fit the thirdcase,?
where there is an exclusive disjunction, only oneof which can ever apply?
where the functions affect different parts of thestructure, as in "the case of Semitic verbs, wheretwo peak change functions apply to the stem -one to the initial syllable and the other to thefinal syllable.The latter is treated as function composition sincethere can be no question of interaction in these casesas they affect different parts of the stem.
The formeris treated as conjoint application of functions, sincethe use of function composition would seem a misusein a situation where only one of the functions couldever apply.4 Some ExamplesThere are a wide variety of different morphologicalfunctions which occur in language.
This section willexamine three in detail.
The first of these is sim-ple suffixation.
Suffixation is the main function usedin many European languages, and exa.rnples are nu-merous.
We shall take the German example /ze : / -/ze:en/, "See" - "Seen", ( ' lake'- ' lakes').
The basicfunction for describing sutfixation is:\ [ (stem,-0)  =:, /S/\]where S is the suffix.
This says, intuitively, "thespace after the stem is replaced with the suffix, S".The flmction required to define the alternation/ze: / - /ze:en/ ,  then is:s mx_en = \[(stem,-0) a / .e.n/\]The second flmction we shall look at is tt, e Germanmnlaut.
The German umlaut is a classic example ofa phonological process which ha~s become fossilized inthe morphology.
Once occurring as part of a vowelharmony process, it applied to stems, fronting a hackvowel when a suffix with a front vowel was added, topreserve vowel harmony.
In modern German, vowelharmony is no longer a productive phonological pro-cess, but the umlaut remains, largely without anysuffix, ms a morphological marker for plurality insome classes of nouns.The description of the umlaut as the change from avowel with the feature \[+,back\] to the correspondingvowel with the feature \[-,back\], is perhaps slightlymisleading.
Although with most vowels this is thecase - / i /  - - /y / ,  /o/  - /oe/, etc.
- with the diph-thong /ou/ ,  the "umlauted" equivalent is /oy/ ,  inwhich the second vowel is fronted, but the first israised.
This raising can be seen as a phonologicalassimilation process, leaving us to define the umlautas the t'ronting of a vowel if it is the only vowel,the fronting of both vowels if the peak consists of adoubled (long) vowel, and the fronting of the secondvowel only in a peak which is a diphthong.
This canbe expressed by means of the following functions:umlaut l '  = \[(peak,?,--1)\[+,back\] ::~ \[-,back\]\]umlautT = \[(peak,?,-2)\[+,back\] => \[-,back\]: (peak,?,-1)/V/ ,(peak,?,-2)/V/\]the second of which says that the first vowel in apeak with two vowels is fronted only if it has thesame value as the second vowel.Tlle other problem with the umlaut is the syllableto which it applies.
MOLUSC requires that a func-tion be defined in terms of the syllable to which itapplies, and this is one of the things which makesit a language for morphology rather than phonol-ogy.
Phonological phenomena occur whatever tilesyllable, provided only that the context restrictionsarc satisfied.
Morphological functions, we argue, al-though in other ways very similar to phonologicalones, apply in a more restricted way to particularparts of stems, which we show by means of exam-ples can be defined in terms of the representationsdescribed above.Most German noun stems are monosyllabic, butthose di-syllabic stems there are seem to divide fairlyevenly betwcen those to which the umlaut applies tothe first syllable and those to which it applies to thesecond syllable, as Table i shows.
However, if welook more closely at this table, we can see that allthose nouns which undergo umlaut on the first sylla-ble, have the unstressed, neutral-vowelled/ou/, /a /or /a l /  as their second syllables.
This might leadus to propose an analysis which rcquircs reference to4 51Nouns which take the umlaut Nouns which take the umlauton the first syllable on the second syllableApfel I'apfal/Boden / 'boodan/Bruder / 'bruuda/Garten / 'gaatan/Hammer / 'hams/Laden / ' laadan/Ofen / 'of0n/Sattel / 'zatal/Ausflucht / 'ausfluxt/Auskunft / 'auskunft/Gebrauch /ga'braux/Gewand /ga'vant/Irrtum / ' iatum/Reichtum /'raixtum/Vormund /ffamunt/Vorhang /!fahat.
}/_ _ _Table 1: Di-syllabie German nounsmetrical feet, in order to specify that the stressedsyllable takes the umlaut, but if we look again, wecan see that in words such ms / iatum/ (" Irrtum','error') and / ra ixtum/ ("Reichtmn", 'wealth'), theunstressed, but non-neutral-rowelled second syllableis umlauted.
Thus, it would seem that the neutral-ness of the vowel is the deciding factor, not the stress.The functions required for the umlaut in German arethus,umlautl  = \[(peak,+l,-1)\[+,back\] => \[-,back\]:(peak,-1,+l)/o/\]umlaut2 = \[(peak,+l,-2)\[+,back\] ~ \[-,back\]: (peak,+l , -1) /V/ , (peak,+l , -2) /V/ ,(peak,-1,+l)/o/\]umla,ut3 = \[(peak,-1,-1)\[+,back\] \[/,back\]\]umlaut4 = \[(peakc-l,Tg)\[+,back\] => \[-,back\]:(peak,-1,-1)/V/,(peak,-1,-2)/V/\]Note that there is no need to specify" the context inwhich the second syllable undergoes the umlaut, asany stem with /a /  in the second peak will be un-changed by the second two functions anyway, as /a /does not have the feature \[+,back\].Since there is no interaction between these fnnc-tions and only one is ever going to have any effect,we combine these with &, indicating conjoint appli.-cation, thus,umlaut = umlautl  & umlaut2 & umlaut3g~ umlaut4Finally, let us look at a more complex function -the partial reduplication found in Latin.
This in-volves alternations such as /fal /  - /fefeli/, /kur /  -/kukuri / .
For this we need two functions.
The firstreduplicates the whole of the first syllable, and thesecond deletes the initial coda.
(that is, the coda ofthe reduplicative affix).
This is necessary becausewe cannot reduplicate the onset and peak of the firstsyllable, as this is not a constituent in the structureswe use.
However, this analysis is actually quite at-tractive from a linguistic point of view, as it leavesus with two very natural functions - (reduplicative)prefixation a.nd consona.nt cluster reduction, a com-mon phonological process.
The two functions are:redup' = \[(stem, +0) => /V/:(stem, + l ) /P / \ ]cod~_0 = \[(coda, +1) a /0/1Tim first of these reads something like " /P / i s  pre-fixed where /P / i s  the same as the first syllable of theinput stem", and uses variable binding.
The wholereduplica,tion can then be defined thus:redup = \[(coda,-1) => 0\] o\[(stem, +0):(stem, +t ) /P / \ ]5 Concluding RemarksThe approach to computational morphologLv advo-cated here allows one to enjoy all the benefits of pow-erful and economical inheritance mechanisms pro-vided by lexical representation languages like thosementioned in 1 above, but still provide phonologi-cally (semi-)realized forms as output.
Using syllablesas the basic unit of description for the realizationlanguage nables succinct and linguistically attrac-tive definitions of a wide variety of morphologicalalternations from simple affixation to partial redu-plication and morphological metathesis.An interpreter for the language has been imple-mented in Prolog, and used to test a wide variety Ofmorphological functions frorn a range of languagesas diverse as English, Arabic and Nakanai.
Cahill(1989) presents the language in full, with a formalsyntax and semantics of the language, a descriptionof the interpreter and analyses of substantial frag-ments of English and Arabic.References1.
