Such toolshave an important role in developing intelli-gent multilingual NLP, text mining and ICTsystems.
In this work, we aim to extend an ex-isting English semantic annotation tool tocover a range of languages, namely Italian,Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese, by boot-strapping new semantic lexical resources viaautomatically translating existing English se-mantic lexicons into these languages.
We useda set of bilingual dictionaries and word listsfor this purpose.
In our experiment, with mi-nor manual improvement of the automaticallygenerated semantic lexicons, the prototypetools based on the new lexicons achieved anaverage lexical coverage of 79.86% and anaverage annotation precision of 71.42% (ifonly precise annotations are considered) or84.64% (if partially correct annotations are in-cluded) on the three languages.
Our experi-ment demonstrates that it is feasible to rapidlydevelop prototype semantic annotation toolsfor new languages by automatically boot-strapping new semantic lexicons based on ex-isting ones.1 IntroductionIn this paper, we report on an experiment to devel-op prototype semantic annotation tools for Italian,Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese based on an ex-isting English annotation tool.
Over the last twentyyears, semantic lexical resources and semantic an-notation tools, such as EuroWordNet (Vossen,1998) and USAS (Rayson et al, 2004), haveplayed an important role in developing intelligentNLP and HLT systems.
Various applications ofsemantic annotation systems and annotated corpusresources have been reported, including empiricallanguage studies at the semantic level (Rayson etal.
2004; Ooi et al, 2007; Beigman Klebanov etal., 2008; Potts and Baker, 2013) and studies ininformation technology (Volk, et al, 2002; Nakanoet al 2005; Doherty et al, 2006; Chitchyan et al,2006; Taiani et al, 2008; Gacitua et al, 2008)among others.While various semantic annotation tools areavailable for monolingual analysis, particularly forEnglish, there are few such systems that can carryout semantic analysis of multiple languages with aunified semantic annotation scheme.
We aim toaddress this issue by extending an existing Englishsemantic annotation tool (Rayson et al, 2004) tocover a range of languages.The USAS semantic annotation tool mentionedabove adopts a lexical semantic classificationscheme derived from Tom McArthur's LongmanLexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur,1981), which consists of 21 main discourse fieldsand 232 sub-fields, such as ?social actions, statesand processes?
and ?emotion?
etc.
It also uses a set1268of auxiliary codes, such as m/f (male/female), +/-(positive/negative) etc.
For example, it tags?happy?
and ?sad?
with ?E4.1+?
and ?E4.1-?
re-spectively, indicating positive and negative senti-ment.
It also identifies many types of multi-wordexpressions, such as phrasal verbs, noun phrases,named entities and true non-compositional idioms,and annotates them with single semantic tags sincethis is highly significant for identifying contextualmeaning.
Recent applications of the USAS taggerinclude analysis of literary language (Balossi,2014), the language of psychopaths (Hancock et al2013) and scientific deception (Markowitz andHancock, 2014).
There would be obvious benefitsif such a semantic tool could cover a wide range oflanguages.
Efforts have been made to port theexisting semantic annotation system to other lan-guages (Finnish and Russian) (L?fberg et al, 2005;Mudraya et al, 2006), so a prototype softwareframework could be used.
However, manually de-veloping semantic lexical resources for new lan-guages from scratch is a time consuming task.
Inthis experiment, we examine the feasibility of rap-idly bootstrapping semantic lexical resources fornew languages by automatically translating exist-ing English semantic lexicons using bilingual dic-tionaries.
We developed prototype semanticannotation tools for Italian, Chinese and BrazilianPortuguese based on automatically generated se-mantic lexicons.
Our evaluation of the tools showsthat it is feasible to rapidly develop prototype se-mantic tools via the aforementioned automaticmethod, which can be improved and refined manu-ally to achieve a high performance.2 Related WorkThere exist various tools that can semantically an-notate multilingual texts, including GATE (Cun-ningham et al, 2011) and KIM (Popov et al, 2003)which, combined together, provide multilingualsemantic annotation functionalities based on ontol-ogies.
Freeling (Padr?
et al, 2012) provides multi-lingual annotations such as named entityrecognition and WordNet sense tagging.
Recentdevelopments in this area include Zhang and Ret-tinger?s work (2014) in which they tested a toolkitfor Wikipedia-based annotation (wikification) ofmultilingual texts.
However, in the work describedhere we employ a lexicographically-informed se-mantic classification scheme and we perform all-words annotation.
In terms of porting tools fromone language to another by translating lexicons,Brooke et al (2009) obtained poor results from asmall dictionary in cross-linguistic sentiment anal-ysis.3 Generating Multilingual Semantic Lexi-cons by Automatic MappingThe USAS tagger relies heavily on the semanticdictionary as its knowledge source, so the maintask in the development of our prototype semanticannotation tools for new languages was to generatesemantic lexicons, both for single word and multi-word expressions (MWE), in which words andMWEs can be associated with appropriate seman-tic tags.
For this purpose, our approach involvesmapping existing English semantic lexicons intotarget languages in order to transfer the semantictags across translation equivalents.
The entries ofthe English semantic lexicons are classified underthe USAS semantic annotation scheme (Archer etal., 2004), which consists of 21 major semanticcategories that are further divided into 232 sub-categories.In order to translate the English semantic lexi-cons into other languages, we needed a bilinguallexicon for each of the target languages, Italian,Chinese and Portuguese in our particular case.
Forthis purpose, we first used two corpus-based fre-quency dictionaries compiled for Chinese (Xiao etal., 2009) and Portuguese (Davies and Preto-Bay,2007), which cover the 5,000 most frequent Chi-nese and Portuguese words respectively.
Thesedictionaries provided high-quality manually editedword translations.
In addition, we used large Eng-lish-Italian and English-Portuguese bilingual lexi-cons available from FreeLang site(http://www.freelang.net/dictionary) as well as anEnglish-Chinese bilingual word list available fromLDC (Linguistic Data Consortium).
Compiledwithout professional editing, these bilingual wordlists contain errors and inaccurate translations, andhence they introduced noise into the mapping pro-cess.
However, they provided wider lexical cover-age of the languages involved and complementedthe limited sizes of the high-quality dictionariesused in our experiment.
Table 1 lists the bilinguallexical resources employed for translating the Eng-lish lexicons into each of the three languages in-volved in our experiment.1269Language Lexical resourcesItalian English-Italian FreeLang wordlist  (33,700 entries);Chinese Chinese/English dictionary (5,000 entries);LDC Eng-Chi bilingual wordlist (110,800 entries)Portuguese Portuguese/English dictionary (5,000 entries);English-Portuguese (Brazilian version) FreeLangwordlist (20,980 entries)Table 1: Bilingual lexical resources used.The semantic lexicon translation process mainlyinvolves transferring semantic tags from an Eng-lish lexeme to its translation equivalent/s.
For in-stance, given a pair of word/MWE translations,one of which is English, if the English headword isfound in the English semantic lexicon, its semanticcategories are passed to its translation equivalents.For the high-quality formal dictionaries, this ap-proach worked very well in our experiment, thanksto the accurate translations and explicit part-of-speech (POS) information provided by such re-sources.With the bilingual word lists from FreeLangand LDC, however, this translation process wasnot straightforward.
Firstly, most of the entries ofthe word lists do not contain any POS information.To avoid losing any potentially relevant semantictags, we have to consider all possible POS catego-ries of each English headword, and the same ap-plies to their translation equivalents.
For example,the English headword ?advance?
has four possibleC7 POS tags (JJ-adjective, NN1-singular noun,VV0-base form of verb, VVI-infinitive verb) in theEnglish semantic lexicon with different semanticcategories including N4 (linear order), A9- (giv-ing), M1 (moving, coming and going), A5.1(evaluation: good/bad), A2.1 (affect: modify,change), Q2.2 (speech acts), S8+ (helping), Q2.1(speech etc: communicative), although with someoverlap, as shown below (in each line, the firstcode is a POS tag and the following ones denoteUSAS semantic categories1):advance     JJ N4advance     NN1 A9- M1 A5.1+/A2.1advance     VV0 M1 A9- Q2.2 A5.1+/A2.1advance     VVI M1 S8+ A9- A5.1+/A2.1 Q2.1In such a case, for each of the possible transla-tion equivalents of the word ?advance?, these fourtypes of POS tags and their corresponding seman-tic tags need to be assigned to their corresponding1 For definitions of the POS and semantic tags, see websiteshttp://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html andhttp://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/USASSemanticTagset.pdftranslations in the target languages.
Obviously thiswould lead to passing wrong and redundant seman-tic tags to the translation equivalents.
Nevertheless,we have to accept such noise in order to increasethe chances of obtaining correct semantic tags, as itwould be easier to remove redundant/incorrect se-mantic tags than searching for missing ones in themanual improvement stage.Another major challenge in the translation pro-cess was the mapping between the POS tagsetsemployed by different lexical resources and tools.Even for the same language, different lexicons andtools can employ different POS tagsets.
For exam-ple, different Portuguese POS tagsets are used bythe Portuguese frequency dictionary and the POSTreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
To bridge between thedifferent POS tagsets, we designed a simplifiedcommon POS tagset for each language, into whichother tags can be mapped.
For example, the Portu-guese POS tagset was simplified into 12 categories?adj, adv, det, noun, pnoun, verb, pron, conj, intj,prep, num, punc?.
Because a single semantic cate-gory tends to span similar POS categories, e.g.
pre-sent/past/progressive tense of verbs, simplificationof POS tagsets generally does not affect semanticannotation accuracy.After applying all the resources and automaticmapping described above, we obtained approxi-mately 38,720, 83,600 and 15,700 semantic lexi-con entries for Italian, Chinese and Portugueserespectively.
Our initial evaluation involved directmanual checking of these bootstrapped lexicons.For example, 5,622 Italian MWE entries and 1,763Italian single word entries have been manually cor-rected.
For the Chinese lexicon, the most frequentwords were identified using the Chinese word fre-quency list of Internet Corpus (Sharoff, 2006), andthe semantic tags of about 560 entries related to themost frequent words were manually corrected.
ForPortuguese, about 900 lexicon entries were manu-ally checked.The manual improvement mainly involves threeprocesses: a) filtering lexicon entries having wrongPOS tags, b) selecting correct semantic tags fromcandidates, c) adding missing semantic tags.
Theamount of effort needed depends on the quality ofthe bilingual dictionaries.
For example, from theautomatically generated 900 Chinese entries con-taining the most frequent (also highly ambiguous)words, 505 entries were selected after the POS fil-tering.
In addition, 145 of them were improved by1270adding missing semantic tags.
Table 2 shows thesizes of the current lexicons.Language Single word entries MWE entriesItalian 33,100 5,622Chinese 64,413 19,039Portuguese 13,942 1,799Table 2: Sizes of current semantic lexicons.4 Architecture of Annotation SystemBased on the multilingual semantic lexicons de-scribed in the previous section, prototype semantictaggers were built for the three languages by de-ploying the lexicons into the existing software ar-chitecture, which employs disambiguation methodsreported by Rayson et al (2004).
A set of POStagging tools were incorporated to pre-processtexts from the target languages.
The TreeTagger(Schmid, 1994) was used for Italian and Portu-guese, and the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova etal., 2003) was used for Chinese.
These tools andsemantic lexicon look-up components form pipe-lines to annotate words in running texts.
Figure 1shows the architecture of the software framework.Figure 1: Architecture of the semantic tagger.5 Evaluation of Prototype SystemFollowing the initial manual evaluation of the pro-totype semantic taggers described in section 3, wethen carried out larger scale automatic evaluationsusing a set of sample corpora.
We conducted twocomplementary types of evaluations: lexical cover-age and annotation precision.
The lexical coverageis a particularly interesting metric for our evalua-tion, as we expect this is where an automatic ap-proach can make significant contribution to thedevelopment of annotation systems.
On the otherhand, high annotation precision normally entailsmanual improvement of the lexical resources or aperiod of training on manually tagged corpora.For the lexical coverage evaluation, three refer-ence corpora were chosen: PAIS?
Italian corpus(Borghetti et al, 2011), LCMC Corpus (LancasterCorpus of Mandarin Chinese) (McEnery and Xiao,2004) and Lacio-Ref Portuguese corpus (Aluisio etal., 2003).
Because PAIS?
and Lacio-Ref corporaare too large for our purpose, we extracted sub-sections of about 1.5 million Italian words and 1.7million Portuguese words from them.For the evaluation, we annotated the corpusdata using the annotation tools of the correspond-ing target languages, and examined what percent-age of the words were assigned with semantic tags.Punctuation marks were excluded in this evalua-tion process.
Table 3 shows the statistics of theevaluation for each language.Language  Numberof wordsTaggedwordsLexicon cove-rage (%)Italian 1,479,394 1,265,399 85.53Chinese 975,482 786,663 80.64Portuguese 1,705,184 1,251,579 73.40Average  79.86Table 3: Lexical coverage of the semantic taggers.As shown in the table, the annotation toolsachieved an average lexical coverage of 79.86%over the three languages, with Italian having thehighest coverage of 85.53% and Portuguese thelowest coverage of 73.40%.
Due to the differenttypes of data in the three sample corpora, this re-sult is not conclusive.
Homogeneous corpus datafrom all of the three languages will be needed tomake more reliable comparison of the lexical cov-erage.
Considering that the tools were built basedon only three bilingual lexical resources over ashort period of time, such lexical coverage is en-couraging.
This result also demonstrates that, ifsufficiently large bilingual lexicons become avail-able; our approach can potentially achieve highlexical coverage.Next we conducted an evaluation of the preci-sion of the prototype tools.
We randomly selectedsample texts for each language as follows.
Italiansample texts were selected from domains of press,contemporary literature and blogs; Chinese sampletexts from press, reviews and fiction; Portuguesesample texts from press and fiction.
In the evalua-tion, we annotated the sample texts using the pro-totype annotation tools and manually checked theprecision among the annotated words.
We usedtwo metrics: correctly tagged and partially cor-pos taggerlemmatizersem taggerwordlexiconmwelexiconcontextrulesraw textannotatedpos taggerlemmatizersem taggerwordlexiconmwelexiconcontextrulesraw textannotated1271rectly tagged.
With the current tools, a word can beassigned with multiple candidate semantic tags.The first evaluation metric refers to the caseswhere the first candidate tag is correct, whereas theother metric refers to the cases where the other tagsin the list are correct or closely related to the trueword sense.
Table 4 shows the statistics of theevaluation.Lan.

However,if we include the partially correct annotations, theprecision scores become more consistent: 76.49%,87.69% and 89.72% for the three languages re-spectively, with an average precision of 84.64%.We also estimated recall based on the numbers oftokens of the sample texts and those tagged cor-rectly/partially correctly, obtaining 55.39%,67.71% and 69.46% for Italian, Chinese and Por-tuguese respectively.
Such a fairly close range ofthe precision and recall values indicates that ourapproach to developing prototype semantic annota-tion tools can be expected to achieve stable resultsacross various languages, although we need larger-scale evaluations to draw a conclusion.
It is worthnoting that, although the recall is still low, thesetaggers are starting to approach the precision of theEnglish system at 91% (Rayson et al, 2004).Our further error analysis revealed that the maincauses of the errors include the homonym transla-tions (e.g.
bank as river bank vs. money bank),translation errors and missing of the translationwords in the English semantic lexicons.
For exam-ple, the Chinese word ????
(father) has a num-ber of synonymous English translation equivalentsin the bilingual lexicon: dad (with semantic tagS4m), baba, da, dada, daddy (S4m), father (S4mS9/S2m), papa (S4m).
It is also translated intopresence (M6, A3+, S1.1.3+, S1.2, S9) by mis-take.
Among the correct English translations, baba,da, dada (transliteration) are not included in theEnglish semantic lexicons.
Making things worse,da is a homonym which is classified as a discoursemarker of exclamation (Z4) in English lexicons.Our current automatic process collects all the se-mantic tags derived from the English translationcounterparts found in the bilingual lexicon and as-signs them to the Chinese word ???
?, resulting inan erroneous entry as shown below:??
noun    M6 A3+ S1.1.3+ S1.2 S9 S4/B1 S4m S9/S2.2m Z4In order to resolve such cases, we will need to con-sider contexts of each translation word pairs?
usagevia parallel or comparable corpora.6 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we have investigated the feasibilityof rapidly bootstrapping semantic annotation toolsfor new target languages2 by mapping an existingsemantic lexicon and software architecture.
In par-ticular, we tested the possibility of automaticallytranslating existing English semantic lexicons intoother languages, Italian, Chinese and BrazilianPortuguese in this particular case.
Our experimentdemonstrates that, if appropriate high-quality bi-lingual lexicons are available, it is feasible to rap-idly generating prototype systems with a goodlexical coverage with our automatic approach.
Onthe other hand, our experiment also shows that, inorder to achieve a high precision, paral-lel/comparable corpus based disambiguation isneeded for identifying precise translation equiva-lents, and a certain amount of manual cleaning andimprovement of the automatically generated se-mantic lexicons is indispensible.
We are continu-ing to improve the multilingual semantic taggersand extend them to cover more languages, such asSpanish and Dutch, aiming to develop a large-scalemultilingual semantic annotation and analysis sys-tem.
We also intend to perform task-based evalua-tion of the manually checked versus automaticallygenerated lexicons.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Prof. Elena Semino, Prof.Yufang Qian and Dr. Richard Xiao for their con-tributions to our research.
