A TWO-LEVEL D I ~  REPRESENTATION 1Giacomo FerrariDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of PisaRonan ReillyEducational Research CentreSt Patrick's College, Dublin 9ABSTRACTIn this paper a two level dialogue representationsystem is presented?
It is intended to recognizethe  s t ruc ture  of a large range of d ia loguesincluding some nonverbal communicative acts whichmay be involved in an interaction.
It provides asyntactic description of a dialogue which can beexpressed  in terms of re -wr i t ing  rules.
Thesemantic level of the proposed representation systemis g iven  by  the goa l  and subgoa l  s t ruc tureunderlying the dialogue syntactic units.
Two typesof goal are identified; goals which relate to thecontent of the dialogue, and those which relate tocormaunicating the content?i.
INTRODUCTIONResearch on computational modelling of discourse hashighlighted some important aspects of hun~an dialogiccommunication.
In some cases (Reichman, 1984), astructural description of linguistic communicationhas been attempted altklough not for proper dialogue.What is requ i red  is a s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ionidentifying a corresponding set of con~nunicativeacts which can be confined in a fixed pattern, toform higher level communication act categories ordialogue constituents.The importance of such a structural description, ifa t ta ined,  is that  it wou ld  make poss ib le  anaxiomatic theory of dialogue, embedding rhetoricalpatterns, focusing, and focus shifting.A possible basis for such a structural descriptionis Burton's (1981) taxonomy of communication acts,with some modifications.Such a formalization of dialogue, however, is afully syntactic one which needs to be augmented withsome semantics.
Our assumption is that dialogueconstituents have a semantic interpretation in termsof goals and subgoals.A theoretical frame for a dialogue classificationsystem based on these assunptions is being developedwith the aim of providing a coherent basis for thecomputational modelling of dialogue.The final aim of our project is, in fact the designand implementation of a computat iona l  d ia log icinteraction system, with the ability to recover fr~ncommunication failure.2.
STRUCZURAL DESCRIPTIONThe syntactic level of a dialogue description systemhas to meet three requirements:(a) It must consist of a model whose genera l i tymakes it applicable to both person-person and1This research was supported in part by the ESPRITprogranme of the CEC under contract AIP P527.person-machine dialogues, irrespective of thesoc io - ins t i tu t iona l  d i spos i t ion  of anyspeaker/user.
(b) It must be capable of describing in terms ofcommunication concepts the i~teractive nature ofdialogue exchanges.
(c) It must be capable of "naming" the units whichcompose  the  d ia logue  exchanges ,  i .eoidentifying an utterance as both of a particulartype and playing a cez%ain role in a part icularexchange.The dialogue units taxonomy proposed  by Bur ton(\].981) seems to sat i s fy  these requ i rements .According to her analysis systen\[ we distinguish fourh ierarchica l ly  related levels: the interaction~which is the largest unit; the transaction; theexchange; the move; and the act.
An interactionconsists of a number of transactions, a transactionconsists of a number of exchanges, and so on.
~esmallest interactive unit in this system is themove.
A move can consist of a number of linguisticand non-linguistic "acts" which are realised eitheras utterances or physical actions.2.1 ACTSAn act is a way of c lassi fying utterances whichoccur in a conversational move.
The act is a levelabove that of the utterance, and a move can consistof a number of acts.
For example, ~le following isan opening n~veby  a teacher in a classroom dialogueconsisting of two acts (in brackets):T: those letters have a special name (Starter)do you know what it is (Elicitation)Most acts are real isedby a wide range of utterancetypes?
For example, the act called 'starter' can bereal ised by either a statement, question, conraand,or a moodless item.we d is t ingu ish  the fo l low ing  15 acts, marker,summons, silent stress, starter, metastatements,conclusion, informative, elicitation, directive,comment, accept, reply, react, acknowledge, preface,prompt, null.
Their definition is always given interms of both l inguistic structure and function.Thus, for instance, the starter act, whose structurehas been described above, has the funct ion  ofproviding information about, directing attention to,or thought towards an area, in order to increase thel i ke l ihood  of making a correct response to thesubsequent initiation.
An informative act has thestructure of a statea~nt and serves the function ofproviding information.
Some of these acts are moredirectly relevant to the problem of analysing personmachine dialogues than others.
However, togetherthey provide a broad fran~work, incorporating bothverbal and non-verbal aspects of dialogue, withinwhich we can situate a detailed analysis of the morerelevant acts.422.2 MOVESAt a h igher  leve l  seven  types  of move arerecogn ized :  de l ineat ing ,  sketch ing ,  opening,supporting, challenging, bound-opening, and re-opening.Moves are the basic units of a dyadic exchange andcan consist of a ntnnber of acts.
We will define thevar ious  moves  in a semi - fo rmal  manner .
'fheformal ism is a type of context-sensitive grammar.If an element is enclosed in { \] it indicates thatthe item is optional.
The symbol I indicates thatthe elements it separates are alternatives.
If anelement is enclosed in < > it indicates that thesymbol  is non- termina l  and requ i res  fu r therexpansion.
The following is the formal descriptionof a sketching move:<sketching move><signal><pre-head><head>:= \[<signal>\] {<pre-head>\] <head>:=marker I su~nons:= starter:= metastatement I conclusionSimilar descriptions are also given for the othermoves.In addition to these standard conventions we adopt aspecial convention to i l lustrate the effects ofcontext.
~ is  takes the form:C\[<argl> <~g2>\]  := expansionWhere C is a function which, when evaluated, expands<arg2> subject to something being true of <argl>.For example, we might want to restrict the expansionof <arg2> ~ only those situation in which <argl>has already occurred as an act in the previous move.This can be accomplished by an appropriately definedC function?2.3 EXCHANGESSequences of moves compose an exchange.
Accordingto Burton two types of exchange are distinguished:expl icit  boundary (EB) exchanges and conversational(C) exchanges.
Explicit boundary exchanges occur,as the i r  name suggests ,  at the boundary  oftransactions.
They can include del ineating and/orsketching moves which must be supported by anotherspeaker.Conversat iona l  exchanges  consist  of chains ofopening, challenging and/or supporting moves.
EBexchanges have the following structure:<EB-exchange> := {<delineating move>}{<sketching move>}<supporting move>ffhe structure of a C-exchange is as follows:<C-exchange> := <initiation>\[<supporting move>{<bound-opening move><supporting move>{<supporting move>}l\]m\] n\]<initiation> := <openingmove>l<challenging move>l<re-opening>The superscr ip ts  i, m, and n represent sets ofnumbers of repetitions ~ Where \[" contains m numbers,m contains n numbers v and n ~onsists o~ just one~umber.
Th~ numbers ,  the - repet i t ion  factorsthemselves, can range from 0 upwards.
However, whenn is 0, m and 1 are also 0.
This arr~\]gement allows~s to ge-nerat~ a different bound-opening/supportingpattern for each m.2.4 TRANSACTIONS AND INTERACTIONSTransactions and interactions are the final twoleve ls  o f  the  c lass i f i ca t ion  h ie rarchy .Transactions consist of patterns of exchanges, andin teract ions  cons is t  of unordered  str ings oftransactions.
Transactions have the following form:<transaction> := {<EB-exchange>}C\[<opening n~)ve> <C-exchange>\]{C\[<challenging move> <C-exchange>\]{C\[<re-openingmove> <C-exchange>\]}l} mThe C funct ion  in this case expands its secondargument if the first argument, a move,  is theinitiator of the C-exchange.Finally interactions t~ke the form:<interaction> := <transaction> 13.
%~E COMV~\]NICATIVE COMPONENTThe fol lowing two assumptions form the basis for apair ing of a dialogue p lann ing  mechan ism wi thelexents of the clialogue description system:dialogue participants always have two cooperatingtypes of goals, substantive real life goals (S-goals),  wh ich  determine  "what to say", andl inguist ic/communicative goals (C-goals), whichdetermine "how to say it".
No re la t ion  ofnecessity seems to hold between them.
In fact, inmost cases there are many d i f fe rent  ways ofexpressing the same goal.it is possible to identify hierarchical relationsbetween goals and subgoals both for substantiveand communicative goals.
However, in the h ighlevel dialogue description system units S-goalssee/~1 to be more important, while at the low levelsC-goal seem to prevail.The highest level of the discourse structure is thetransaction.
Given that the dialogue as a whole is ameans of effecting the high-level goals of one oro ther  of the participants, we can functionallydefine transaction as the unit of dialogue concernedwith effecting these high-level goals.At  the h ighest  lewi.~l of the d ia logue 's  goa ls t ruc ture  the dominant  goals  mot ivat ing  thetransaction are those concerned with the substanceof  the  d ia logue,  not  the means  by wh ich  thesubstance is conveyed.
As we move down thishierarchy it is possible to discern a bifurcation ofgoals into one group concerned with the substance ofthe  d ia logue ,  and  the other  concerned  w i thcommunication of this substance.
These are the S-goa ls  and C-goa ls  (or more  proper ly ,  S and Csubgoals) mentioned above.43A transaction is always motivatedby a general goalsuch as seek information, make a t ra in  journey(Al len, 1982),  make a reservation.
The socialcontext, for example the relation between speakerand hearer  or s imply  a social  convention, cansuggest rhetorical choices.
Among these might bethe direct stating of the general goal, the indirectrevelation o f the  general goal by several relatedquestions, the questioning of a system's generalcapabilities before asking, and so on.Essent ia l ly,  exchanges can be thought of as thetopic-bearing elements of the dialogue.
New topicsare introduced by either an EB-exchange (explicitboundary), a C-exchange (conversational) with anopening move as its first move, or a C-exchange witha challenge as its first move.
Topics that havebeen discussed prior to the most recent challengeare re-introducedby a C-exchange with a re-openingmove as its f i rst  move.
Topics that have beendiscussed less recently are re- introduced by meansof an EB-exchange containing a sketching move.There is, therefore, a strong connection between theexchange s t ructure  of the transaction and thepattern of topic-shifts in the dialogue.
Thesetop ic -sh i f t s ,  in tu rn ,  a re  re la ted  to theconversant's shift ing goal structure.
This isespecial ly true in task-oriented dialogues, wherethe component operations of the task are mirrored inthe topic structure of the dialogue (Grosz, 1981).A general goal can be, therefore, sp l i t  into asequence of subgoals bof/n because the task consistsin reality of a sequence of subtasks (Grosz, 1981)and because of rhetorical reasons.
This gives avery  spec ia l  s ta tus  to exchanges  in  ourclassif icat ion system.
A transaction is in fact,divided into several exchanges determined either bythe structure of the task to be carried out, or byrhetor i ca l  cons iderat ions ,  or by  both .
Inparticular, we should distinguish between two typesof exchange:- a subtask exchange, which aims at reaching somesubstantive subgoal- an instrumental exchange, which aims at attainingsome communicative (sub)goal, such as introducingthe terms of the conversation, or clarifying someunclear substantive goal or subgoal.Every exchange is conloosed of moves and is, in mostcases, opened by some form of topic shift ing moveand  c losed  by  a conc lud ing  move.
Othersabcategories of exchanges can be found.
However, apattern of moves is associated with every exchange.At th is  leve l  d i f fe rent  rhetor i ca l  cho ices(motivated by C-goals) may appear in the form ofdifferent distr ibutions of instrumental or non-clar i fying exchanges within a transaction.
The S-goals of an exchange can be computed  f rom theinterpretat ion of the utterances comprising it,ut i l is ing some notion of general focus (Sidner,1979).At a lower level, the goals that motivate the movesare drawn equally from S-goals and C-goals.
At themove level, the S-goal  s t ruc ture  becomes  lessrelevant to the sequence of moves.
Moves are mostlyrhetorical elements.
They signal the pushing to a(new) topic (topic shifting and topic re-introducingmoves) ,  the cont inuat ion  of a top ic  ( top ic44maintaining moves), and the popping of a topic (non-introduction).Push ing and popping are the opening and closingmoves of an exchange.
The coherence of the topic isto be expected within an exchange and should beperhaps checked from one move to the other.
A topicshift is in itself a pushing move.
The notion oftopic probably coincides with the notion of focusedgoal.Moves serve as syntactic components of exchanges andevery move is a step in a linguistic goal structure.Therefore, every exchange consists of a pattern ofmoves representing the communicative choices of thedialogue participants.
In some cases, there is acorrespondence between the S-goal associated with anexchange and some move (chal lenge) .
A l so  acommunicative adherence between one move and thefollowing should hold.
Coherence means that thetop ic  must be roughly the same, while adherencemoans that the given move canbe followed only by aspecific set ofmoves.Finally, an act is a limited linguistic act, utteredto effect very local communicative/rhetoric goals.In a dialogue most moves consists of a single act,but this does not.
always hold.
A distinction can bemade at the act level between acts which are drawnfrom a l imited class of utterances, and acts whichare not l imited in this way.
We wil l  call theseclosed and open classes, respectively.
Most of theclosed class items are associated with acts whichsubserve C-goals rather than S-goals.
This is nottoo surprising since the items from the closed classdo not usually convey substantive information butusually serve as go-ahead signals in a dialogue.Whereas the primary function of open class items isto convey task-relevant information.4.
SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE AND GOAL STRUCTUREFrom the previous paragraph it has been clear thatthere is a different distribution of S and C-goalsa long the h ie rarchy  of d ia logue  un i ts .
Inparticular, higher level units are more related toS-goals, while low level units are connected to C-goals.The model presented is intended to serve main lydescr ip t ive  and representational purposes.
Nodefinition is given of the process of inference ofthe goal structure from the syntactic structure ofdialogue.
However it is possible to imagine thatsuch a process rely, among others, on- the functions assigned to ~ialogue subunits- the actions mentioned in any specific utterance.5.
CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVESThe advantages of the proposed dialogue descriptionsystem are the following:- the design of a grammar for the description ofdialogue units and subunits is madepossible;- the distinction between S- and C-goals allows thetreata~nt of possible interrupt and clarif icationsubd ia logues  in the same frame as the goaldirected parts of the dialogue;Fur ther  research  wi l l  be devoted  to thespec i f icat ion of a more deta i led grammar  ofexchanges and moves, and to the establishing of astricter correspondence between more types of goals.However ,  a stil l  more important point to beclarified is the specification of the for1~al devicesby which the semantic (goal) structure can beinferred from utterance and act elements and'raised' to the higher dialogue units.6.
