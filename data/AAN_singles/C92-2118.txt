Exploit ing Linguistic Iconism for ArticleMachine TranslationCorne l ia  Ze l insky -Wibbe l tUn ivers i ty  of  the  Saar lnad ,  FRGe-mai l :  cor@dude.un i -sb .deSelection in1 In t roduct ionThis paper is meant to give a cognltive-linguistic ex-planation of the process of reference.
This meansthat we ate concerned with meaning arising from thespeaker's conceptualization of reality.
Different waysof referring to the s~me real situation are reflecteddifferently on the expression side of language.
Wewill exemplify this with the use of articles.
We dealwith two contrasting processes wh/.ch are reflected inNP syntax: on the one hand, this is the selection of aspedfic part of a MAss, which normally has an indefoinite extension.
This process results in identificationemd hence in ~oken reference (cf.
Deelerck 1986:163;Croft 1985; Langacker 1987a).
On the other hand weare concerned with type  re ference  to COUNT enti-ties (cf.
ibd.
), more specifically with how we can talkabout the whole kind of an entity which in reality isrepresented by individual instances.Our ultimate aim is to exploit the cognitive principlesby which reference is determined and to hnport theminto Machine T~anslation (MT).
Traditional MT sys-tems so far have not been concerned with a seman-tic interpretation mid translation of articles.
Thetranslationai relevance of interpreting NP readingshas been stressed in different places (cf.
Meya 1990;Grabski 1990; gelinsky-Wibbelt 1988, 1901): Bound-ing by individuatioh of a MASS results in definitenessin Germanic languages (Das Wasser in der Tasseist sehmutzig.
'The water in the cup is dirty.').
InEnglish type reference to masses is usually expressedby the bare construction as in Wa~er is indispens-able, which in German can be expressed both bythe definite NP and by the bare construction as in(Das) Wasser ist nnverzichtbar (see e.g.
ter Meulen1988:390).
In Spanish a D~.FINITZ NP is usually usedfor type reference (El espa~ol me gnsta rods que elraso.
'1 like Spanish better than Russian.
').Type reference to a COUNT entity by the subject NPmay surface in two contrasting structures in French:Uu specta~enr veut voir quelque chose.
'A spectatorwants to see something.'
Le speeta~eur es~ uu ~trehumaiu.
'The spectator is a human being.
'In this paper we will explain the conceptual condi-tions for type and token reference, which in turn es-tablish the conditions for generating the correct sur-face structures in the respective target language.
Weinterpret genericity vs. identification by default rules(cf.
McDermott & Doyle 1980; Reiter 1980), whichshould mirror cognitive processing (cf.
e.g.
Morreau1988, Schubert & Pelletier 1988).
There seems toexist a preference order among the contextual con-ditions on the restriction or preservation of the un-bounded extension of a MASs.
This order is basedon the degree of prototypicality of the respective ref-erence function: the typicality of the NP's referencefunction is rendered by the strength which the modoifiers have with respect to bounding or unbouudlngthe entity's normal extension denoted by the noun.The component of default rules has been implementedin the CAT2 system and results in successful articletranslation.
We relate our conceptual conditions tothe CAT2 rules given in the annex.DeMing with different ways of reference, the concep-tualization of ent i t ies  will be in the foreground.
En-tities are denoted by nouns.
We assume that wordshave a basic prototypical sense, which is representedin the lexicon.
Senses of decreasing prototypicniityate related to this prototypical sense by systematicmetonymy rules.2 Reference  and  prototype  semant icsIt is our ulna to explain how universal and language-specific iconic principles result in different ways ofreferring to the same tea\] situation by using differ-ing syntactic structures.
Speakers of different lan~guage communities, constrained by their different cul-tures, arrive at different measures of conventionality,salience, relevance and typicality for specific parts oftheir environment and thus categorize and refer tothese in different ways.
Our theoretical frameworkwill be prototype semantics (cf.
Rosch 1978), be-cause this theory explains how categorization is inline with human judgement.
Categorization is therecognition or judgement of some instance as beingthe same as n previously occurring one~ where thedifferences which may well exist in reality are thenirrelevant for the human conceptualizer.
We want toadapt these hmnan strategies of categorisation to acomputational interpretation of reference.2.1 Cogn i t ive  const ra in ts  onconceptua l i za t ionNouns denote  something by virtue of their basic,lexicai meaning.
Reference  is only achieved whena noun is used in a grammatical construction.
Theinterpretation of a word's meaning in different waysrelies on the speaker's capacity to construe alternatecognitive representations of the same real situationand to express this by different grammatical con-structions.
This is the result of selecting certainsubstructures from several cognitive dimensions (cf.Langacker 1987c:189ff.
):ACrEs DE COL1NG-92, NANnieS, 23-28 AOUt" 1992 7 9 2 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992?
Along the most significant dimension a speakerdivides a scene into prof i le and  base.
The baseis the necessary background knowledge out ofwhich the profile is singled out as the prominentpart.
For instance the English words lamb, ewe,mutton and sheep profile different aspects of thecommon base which consists in the knowledgethat we have about a certain animal, namely theaspects of AGE, GENDER I NUTRITION, COLLEC~TION respectively.
The English nouns all trans-late into the German noun Schaf, which gener-alizes over all aspects profiled in English.
Thisshows that both the selection of alternate sub-structures and of different degrees of granularityresult in different mental profilings and hence dif-ferent expressions.
* Along the f igure /ground dimension the mentalforegrounding and backgrounding of the partswhich constitute a scene is achieved.
For lln-guistic purposes the foregrounded part consti-tutes the t ra jec tor  (of.
Langacker 1987c), whichcorresponds to the grammatical subject or verb,and the background constitutes the landmark ,which corresponds to the grammatical object.?
Speakers may mentally image reality from differ-ent perspect ives .
To take Bolinger's example(1975:181):(1) The airlines charge too much.
(2) Airlines eharye too much.In the first case the speaker's perspective coin-tides with the time of speech and the scope ofhis predication includes all airlines currently ex-isting.
In the second case the speaker is fartheraway from the real situation, so that the scopeof his predication includes all airlines of past,present and future (cf.
rule (16) in the annex).The conditions for this difference in perspectiveare not provided within this sentence.
* Finally, p ro totyp ica l i ty  is a dimension alongwhich the speaker construes his cognitive rep-resentation of reality.
The core of a semanticcategory relating to a word is represented bythe "optimal" prototypical instance to which in-stances of decreasing typicality are related (cf.Rosch 1978).
A speaker can use an expression ina more or less typical meaning.
We have to relateentities to their typicality space, as reference toentities by the predication of a typ ica l  propertymay differ in surface strucnre from reference bypredicating a cont ingent  property (Us speefa-fear vent voir qnelqne chose.
'A spectator wantsto see something.'
Le speetatenr est nn et~e hu-main.
'The spectator is a living being'.
)2.2 Conceptua l i z ing  externa l  and  in terna lbound ing  of  ent i t iesThe following characteristics determine whether anentity is conceptualized as COUNT or MAss, andwhether a MASS is conceptualized as HOMOGENEOUSor as HETEROGENEOUS (of.
Wiersbicka 1985:335):?
unboundedness  vs. boundedness* arbitrary vs. non-arbitrary d iv is ib i l i ty?
pragmatically relevant vs. non-relevant count -ab i l i tyLangacker (1987a:63) defines COUNT nouns to de-note a hounded region.
This implies that COUNTnouns are individuated on the lexical level.
It infor this reason that we can coneeptualise several in-stances of a COUNT entity and express this fact bythe plural form (cups, rooms, figures).
A MAss noundenotes an unbounded region in physical or mentalspace (butter, water).
A MAss is cumulative, thatis, different amounts of the same MAss are arbi-trarily unifiable without changing the MAss meaning(cf.
Quine 1960:91; Bunt 1985; Link 1983).
The un-bounded extension of a MAss implies that we cannotconceptualize one or several bounded partitions of aMASS per se, s MASS may not be indlviduated with-out additional linguistic means.HOMOGENEOUS entities, such as those denoted bybutter are arbitrarily divisible without losing theirconstitution and function.
The form and functionof HETEROGENEOUS MASS entities, such as those de-noted by furniture, are violated if they are divided.Langacker's definitions apply to lexical units; they donot exclude n bomtding or unbounding at the level ofthe NP.If we determine the countability of MAss entities insemantic terms, three classes emerge dependent ontheir inner constitution (el.
Wiersbicka1985:321):1.
For MAss entities conceptualized exclusivelyas HOMOGENEOUS there exists no possibilityof counting them without additional inguisticmeans.
They have no 'built-in modes of distin-guishing their reference' (Quine 1960:91).
TheseMAss nouns can, however, adopt the criteria ofdistinctness, identity and particularity under aspecific pragmatic purpose; then a classifier ex-presses some conventionalized form or function(cL Lehrer 1986, Allan 1977) as in a piece ofbutter, a glass of water.2.
For COLLECTIVE MASS entities comprising dif-ferent individuals, such as furniture, there existsno relevant perspective from which they may becounted.3.
Some MAssEs are normally conceptualized asHOMOGENEOUS t but under a pragmatically un-usual perspective may also be conceptualizedas a HETEROGENEOUS COLLECTIVE entity com-prising identical individuals, such as graiu, hair;,for instance one may count hair in order to have ameasure for the density of a person's hair.
In thissituation the individual members are referred toby the plural form (eL Zeliasky-Wibbelt 1992).3 Mu l t ip le  ways  o f  re ferenceType reference to a COUNT entity by default isachieved by attributing a typ ica l  property to it:(3) Airlines fly airplanes.If, in contrast to this, we attribute a contingent prop-erty to airlines, token reference to some bounded partoccurs attd a definite NP expresses the restriction inEnglish:(4) The airlines fly airplanes again.AcrEs DE COL1NG-92, NAm~:S. 23-28 AO~' 1992 7 9 3 P~oc.

1992Type reference to a count entity may be expressed bya singular definite NP in most European languages:(5) The computer i~ an indispensable ~ool nowada~/s.In this case the totality is referred to by metonymy:one instance is taken to represent the whole kind ofcomputers (cf.
Bolinger 1975:182).
This generaliza-tion is achieved by the predication of an EVaLUaTION:indispensable is an EWtLUX'rIVE adjective, and if thespeaker utters an evaluation this results in a habitualmeaning which implies TEMPORAL UNBOUNDEDNESSin the absence of conflicting conditions (cf.
rule (14)in the annex).The prototypical type reference occurs to entities des-iguated by NPs in subject position, i.e.
to entitieswhich are mentally foregrounded as the trajector andlocated with respect o some property space desig-nated by the landmark NP in object positiou.
Thelatter is usually restricted by the verbal scope of pred-ication, especially if the verb expresses some tempo-rally extended action as in (4).
This does not holdfor verbs expressing an ATTITUDE or a SEMIOTIC orCOGNITIVE action or state as in (22).
These verbsimply habituality, i.e.
TEMPOItaL UNBOUNDEDNESSwhich the process has in relation to the speech event,if not restricted by conflicting conditions:(22) The~/ regard computers as important.4 Contextua l  bound ing  a MASSconceptWhereas in German individuated as well as non-individuated entities may be designated by definiteNPs, in English only individuated entities may be sodesignated; non-individuated entities are designatedby the bare construction:(6) Das Wasscr in der Tasse isi schmutzig.---4The water in the cup is dirty.
(7) (Das) Wasscr ist unverzichtbar f~r die Men-schheit.___.+Water is indispensable for humanit~.l.In (6) the definite article expresses that out of the ba-sicaily unbounded MAss water the PP-modifier picksout the quantity which is in the cup as being dirty (cf.Platteau 1980:114; cf.
rule (7) in the annex).
In (7)the adjective xpresses an evaluation about the sub-ject NP, from which u habitual sentence meaning isinferred and the subject NP thereby refers to a total-ity, hence the bare construction in English (cf.
rule(14) in the annex).In order to individuate a specific part of a MASS,this specific part has to be identified by restrictivemodification, as the water in the cup in (6) (cf.
C.Lyons 1980; Hawkins 1980), whereas the unboundedextension of the Mass is preserved, if the Mass en-tity has no modifier, as in (7), or if the modifier is notsuccessful in scope narrowing, which holds for non-restrictive modifiers which are themselves conceptu-alised as unbounded, as in (15) below.
We assumethat a hearer - following a conversational principle(cf.
Declerck 1986:87) - tends to interpret Germandefinite NPs dominating Mass nouns an GENERICby default, unless semantically restrictive modifiersyield a contrasting interpretation (cf.
rule (15) in theannex).
In this section we will give the conditionsfor interpreting German definite NPs and translatingthem into English.4.1 Re la t ive  clause modi f icat ionRelative clauses modifying Mass nouns have greateststrength with respect o modifying the reference func-tion.
A relative clause inherits the temporal bounded-hess from its verbal predicate.
According to Vendler'sclassification (cf.
Vendler 1967, Dowry 1979) TEM-PORALLY BOUNDED verbs a~e those which expressan ACHIEVEMENT or an ACCOMPLISHMENT of somestate of affairs (cf.
also Langacker 1987a).
In (8)the relative clause - by virtue of its predicate liefcrn,which denotes a~ ACHIEVEMENT -- narrows down theunboundedness which Information expresses in its ba-sic meaning to that amount which holds for a specificperiod of time (cf.
rule (2) in the annex):(8) Die Information, die 9eliefert wird ...The information which is given ...(9) Die 1ndasfrie, die entwickelt wird, braucht fi-nauzielle Untcrst~tzun9.Industry.t, which is being developed, needs finan-cial support.In (9) the Aktionsart of the modifying relative clauseis ACTIVITY, which is unbounded, and hence doesnot restrict the unbounded extension which indus-try denotes in its basic meaning (el.
rule (4) in theannex).In anaiogy to the Ak~iousart of the verb, the aspectof the relative clause can affect the unboundeduessof MAss entities.
In (9) above, the DURaTIVEpect of the relative clause, which implies that thebeginning and end of the action is unbounded inrelation to the reference time (of.
Comrie 1976), isan additional condition for the preservation of theunbounded extension of the Mass.
In contrast othis, the RIgTROSPECTIVE aspect of a relative clause,by the completion which the action has with respectto the reference time, results in delimitation of somepart of a Mass (cf.
rule (3) in the annex):(10) Die lndustrie, die entwickelt worden ist, brauch~weiterhin .tlnanzielle Unterst~ttznng.----4The indastr~y, which has been developed, needsfurther financial support.Note again that these conditions only apply in the ab-sence of conflicting conditions which may be providedby a broader context.4.2 Ad ject ive  phrase  modi f icat ionAmong the conditions provided by adjective modifi-cation the comparison expressed by the superlativehas greatest strength in bounding a Mass entity.
Itfixes the conception of the MJtss entity from all itspossible realisations exactly to the degree of the prop-erty specified by the adjective, as in sentence (11) (cf.Bierwisch 1989).
The result is identification, which isACTES DE COLING-92, Nnr, rrEs, 23-28 nO(Zr 1992 7 9 4 PROC.

They are also called 'absolute' becausethey either do or do not apply to an entity as thereexists only one reMisation of them; they are concep ~tuMised as sharply bounded and hence in Germandefinite NPs result in a restriction of the unboundedextension of a MAss as the adjective system- bezoeen('system-related') (cf.

Notethat we are concerned here with the translation ofGerman definite NPs into English:(12) Die systcm-bezogene I formation fehlt.The systcm-rcla~ed informalion is lacking.This is the unmarked, typical modification of MAssnouns by NON-GRADABLE adjectives.
There are,however, NoN-GRADABLE adjectives which standout as non-typical when modifying a MAss noun.
Bychoosing a LOGATIONAI, or t~ROVE, NANGE adjectiveas rnodifyer, as in (13) and (14), the speaker merelymakes an additional commentary to the inherentlyunbounded entity by locating it in a conventionalizedproperty space and thus creates a new unboundedMAss (cf.

An exception are MODAL ad-jectives which are DI~ONTIC.
They restrict the MAssto exactly that partition about which the speaker ex-presses an obligation (cf.
rule (8) in the annex):(16) Die notwendige Forschung wird uich~ gefJrdert.The necessary research is not being supported.COMPARISON adjectives such as similar behave in thesame way by identifying the specific part of the un-bounded MAss which is compased, ms we can onlycompare what we can identify (cf.
rule (8) in theannex):(17) Die veryleichbare lnformatiou \[chit.The comparable information is lacking.5 Ty l le  re ference  to  COUNT ent i t iesIf the speaker efers to the type of a COUNT entity, theindefinite astide expresses that the entity's descrip-tion satisfies its prototypical or "ideal" concept (cf.Croft 1985:7-5), or it expresses a certain regularity(cf.
Kr i~a 1988:287).
This results from attributing atypical property to the whole kind of the entity (cf.Declerck 1986:168f.
):(18) Ein Zuschauer will ctwas schen.Uu spectateur veut voir quelque chose.
'A spectator wants to see something.
'ttere the predicated property defines a stereotypeof the species of guschauer in the sense of Putnam(1975), hence this sentence is GENErtIC by default,i.e.
it is true even if the predicated typical propertydoes not hold 'inclusively' (cf.
Declerck 1986:157L)of all members of tile species of Zasehauer.
If notypical property is attributed to the entity, but theentity is classified by a basic domain supereategory,comparable to Heyer's essential property (cf.
Heyer1988:180ff.
), a law-like GENERIC reading results,which holds 'inclusively' - without exception - forthe whole kind (also referred to as 'nomic' sentencesor 'gnomic' by Carlson 1982).
Three different NPsmay then be used in German, but only definite NPsin French (eL also Winkelmann 1980:97), as shown bythe following examples, where guschauer is classifiedby NXTUrtXL and NOMINAL (SOCIAl:,) kinds:(19) Zuschauer sind Menscheu.~,e(s) ,pcc~at~,(s} e,~ OonO uu (des) ~tre(,) h~main(s).

1992They do not restrict the unbounded extension re-letted to by the object NP (cf.

Hence the bare construction in Spanish.
(25) This tczt i~ written in Spanish.----tEste tezto estd escrito en eslm~ol.7 Conc lus ionWe have shown how conceptual bounding and un-bounding of entities result in different ways of ref-erence.
The translational relevance of the processof bounding and unbounding arises from the factthat different languages are sensitive to the processby surface distinctions in different ways.
Our non-monotonic approach to the problem guarantees ex-tensibillty of the rule fragment, that is, we can addrules with conflicting conditions provided by a largercontext in the future, when the interpretation is madefrom n broader perspective, for instance by includingdiscourse phenomena and by using a knowledge base.8 Annex  o f  Defau l t  Ru lesThis annex contains out fragment of default rules,which interpret German NPs  in a compositional way,i.e.
by unifying the semantic and syntactic featuresof different lexical and non-lexical nodes of the sen-tence.
The result of this interpretation process is aninterlingually constant NP reading out of which thesyntactic NP structure is generated.
The rule orderrepresents the degree of markedness; the less marked,more typical interpretation only applies after the ex-ceptional marked conditions have failed.In order to facilitate reading we have translated theCAT2 rules into trees and simplified the feature struc-tures to mere labels (The only relations are thoseenclosed in curly brex.kets: ";" indicates disjunction," ,"  conjunction).
For n mote detailed explanation ofCAT2 cf.
Sharp 1991.
CAT2 consists in stepwisetranslation between two linguistically motivated lev-eis, both in source language analysis and in targetlanguage synthesis.
These levels represent eonfigu-rational structure and semantic functional structure.The semantic level should contain all informationneeded for transfer, analysis and synthesis.
Our rulefragment is implemented on this level.
The structureof the ~ules is based on the DP analysis (cf.
