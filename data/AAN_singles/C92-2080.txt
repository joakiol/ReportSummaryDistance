cornABSTRACTWe propose a new method to resolve am-biguity in translation and meaning in-terpretation using linguistic statistics ex-tracted from dual corpora of sourcu audtarget languages in addition to tim logicalrestrictions described on dictiomtry andgrammar ules for ambiguity resolution.It provides reasonable criteria for deter-mining a suitable equivalent ranslationor meaning by making tile dependency re-lation in the source language be reflectedin the translated text.
The method canbe tractable because tile required staffs-tics can be computed semi-automaticallyin advance from a source language corpusand a target language corpus, while anordinal corpus-based translation methodneeds a large volume of bilingual corpusof strict pairs of a sentence and its transla-tion.
Moreover, it also provides the meansto compute the linguistic statistics on thepairs of meaning expressions.1 In t roduct ionIt~ecently many kinds of natural lauguage pro-cessing systems like machine translation systemshave been developed and put into practical use, butambiguity resolution ill translation and meaning in-terpretation is still the primary issue in such sys-tems.
These systems have conventionally adopteda rule-ba.~ed disambiguation method, using linguis-tic restrictions described logically in dictionary andgrammar to select the suitable equivalent transla-tion and meaning.
Generally speaking, it is impos-sible to provide all the restrictions ystematicallyin advance.
Furthermore, such machine transla-tion systems have suffered from inability to selectthe most suitable equivalent translation if the in-put expression meets two or more restrictions, andhave difficulty in accepting any input expressionthat meets no restrictions.Ill order to overcome these difficulties, followingmethods .~r~ proposed these years:1.
F, xample-Ba.sed Translation : tile methodbased oil trans\[atiou examples (pairs of sourcetext, aml its translation) \[Nagao 84, Sato 90,Smuita 90\]2.
Statistics-Based Translation : the nmthod us-ing statistical mr probabilistic information ex-tracted from a bilingual corpus \[Brown 90,Nomiyama 9\]\]Still, each (ff them has inherent problems and isinsufficient for ambiguity resolution.
For example,either all e?amplc~b~mcd translation method or astatistics-based translation method needs a large-scale database of translation exalnpl~, and it isdifficult to collect all adequate amount of a bilin-gual corpus.In this paper, we propose a new method to selectthe suitable equivalent ranslation using the sta-tistical data extracted independently from sourceand target language texts \[Muraki 91\].
The sta-tistical data used here is linguistic statistics repre:senting the dependency degree on the pairs of ex-pressions in each text, especially statistics for co-occurrence, i.e., how frequently the expressions co-occur in the Sallle seutence~ the sanle paragraph ortile same chapter of each text.
The dependencyrelation in the source language is reflected in thetranslated text through bilingual dictionary by sc~lecting the equivalent translation which ma.ximizesboth statistics tot co-occurrence in tile source andtarg(~t language text.
Moreover, the method alsoprovid~ the means to compute tile linguistic statis-tics on the pairs of meaning expressions.
We calltlds method for equivalent translation and meaningselection DMAX Criteria (Double Maximize Crite-ria based on Dual Corpora).First, we make comments on the characteristicsand the linfits of the conventional methods of am-biguity resolution in translation and meaning inter-pretation in the second section.
Next, we describethe details of DMAX Criteria for equivalent trans-lation selection in the third section.
And last, weexplain the means to compute the linguistic statis-tics on the pairs of meaning expressions.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^of.rr 1992 5 2 5 PROC, oJ, COLING-92, NA~CrEs.
AUG. 23-28, 19922 Conventional Methods ofAmbiguity Resolution2.1 Rule-Based TranslationIn conventional methods, linguistic restrictionsdescribed in the dictionary and grammar are usedto select the suitable equivMcnt translation ormeaning.
In general, these restrictions are de~scribed logically on characteristics of another ex-pression which modifies or is modified by the ex-pression to be processed.
For example, to translatepredicates (verbs and predicative adjectives), se-mantic restrictions are deacribed on essential casearguments in forms of semantic markers to indicatefeatures of words or terms in the thesaurus to showa hierarchy composed of word concepts.Though these conventional methods have beenvery useful to realize natural anguage processingsystems, ttmy have the following problems:1.
It is impossible to decide the most suitableequivalent translation if the input expressionmeets two or more restrictions.2.
Analysis fails when the input expression canmeet no restrictions.3.
Actually the practical systems depends onsuch heuristics as pre-declded application or-der of restrictions or some default equivalenttranslations or meanings.4.
The description of the restrictions i based ondirect structural dependencies, therefore it isquite difficult to describe the restrictions basedon sister-dependency or between expressionsbelong to different sentences or paragraphs.5.
Restrictions on any dependencies cannot bethoroughly described in advance.For example, a Japanese word "booru" has twomeanings, one is 'a bail(a round object used in agame or sport)' and the other is 'a bowl(a deepround container open at the tap especially used incooking)'.
When this word occurs in the followingsentence, it must mean ~a bowP.JAP: Booru-nl mizu-o irerubowl dative water obj, pour,or marker marker put inball or fillENG; To pour water in%o a bowlIn this case, to select he meaning by the logical re-strictions on dependencies, it is necessary to havedescribed even the appearance or usage of the in-direct object of the verb "irern".
To describe suchdetail restrictions on ,all expressions may be possi-ble, but it is quite difficult because the trouble ofdescription and the cost of calculation.2.2 Example-Based TranslationBesides the conventional translation methodabove, a machine translation system based ontranslation examples (pairs of source texts andtheir translations) is also proposed \[Nagao 84,Sato 90, Sumita 90\].
This type of system, calledExample-Based Machine Translation, has stored alarge amount of bilingual translation examples msa database, and translates input expressions by re-trieving an example most similar to tim input fromthe database.
There is no failure of output in thismethod because it selects the most similar examplenot the identical one.However this example-based translation systemneeds a large-scale database of translation exam-ples, and iL is difficult to collect an adcxluateamount of bilingual corpora.
Even if it is possible,there is no means to divide the sentences of suchcorpora into fragments and link them automati-cally, and it costs us too much time and money todivide and link manually.
Besides, this method canneither achieve precise meaning interpretation be-cause it selects equivalent translation directly fromthe input expression and leaves meaning interpre-tation out of consideration.To overcome this problem, we have also proposeda new mechanism based on sentential examples indictionary, which utilize the merits of both thetranslation by logical restrictions and the example-based methud, by selecting the equivalent transla-tion which ha.s tlle most similar example to the in-put expression IDol 92\].
This mechanism can guar-antee no failure in selecting an equivalent transla-tion, but the description of relations are still basedonly on direct structural dependencies.2,$ Statistics-Based TranslationSeveral new methods especially of machine trans-lation have been proposed lately, which select asuitable equivalent translation using statistical orprobabilistic information extracted from languagetext \[Brown 90, Nomiyama 91\].
Because many ma-chine readable texts have been already collectednowadays, it is not difficult to extract statisticalinformation of each expression in the texts semi-automatically.
Moreover, the statistical informa-tion reflects the context in which eactt word occursand implies the logical restrictions based on indi-rect structural dependencies.Although we call the systems in a same word"statistics-based translation", statistical informa-tion used in the methods is diverse, such as trans-lation probability, connectivity of words, statisticsfor (co-)occurrence, tc.
We make comments onthe characteristics and the limits of these systems.The first method uses fertility probabilities,translation probabilities and distortion probabili-ties \[Brown 90\].
Fertility means the number ofthe words in target language that the word of ttleAcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOOT 1992 5 2 6 PROC.

AUG. 23-28, 1992source language produces, and distortion means tiledistance between the position of the word of thesource language and the one of the target language.Tile method has been applied to au experiinentaltranslation system from French to English.
However, since these probabilities are extracted froma large amount of text pairs that are translationsof each other, this method must be suffered fromtile santo difficulties ,as examplc~b~sed translationin collecting and analyzing an adequate amountof bilingual corpora, and it's very difficult to ap-ply this method to the languages whose linguisticstructures aren't similar each other, such as Englishand Japanese.The second method uses tile statistics for occur-fence in target language text \[Nomiyama 91\].
It iscalculated ill advance how frequently the each ex-pression occurs in the t~rget language text, whichneeds only to belong the same tiehl as the sourcelanguage text beblngs, but not to be a translatedtext of tile source language text.
If there are morethan one possible quivalent translations, the mostfrequent ranslation is selected through this calcu-lated data.
Moreover, this nrethod can be appliedto make good use of the conventional methods ofselecting equivalent translations, tbr it employs thefrequency data exclusively when logical restrictionscannot select one out of candldates.However this method hms one big problem.
Thehigh frequency of the expression in the target lan-guage text may not originate from the frequencyof the expression in the source language text to betranslated, because one target language xpressiondoes not correspond to only one source languageexpression ill general.Suppose the following sentence is a first examph.
':JAP: Sorlo saibankan-wa kooto-tothat judge subj.

In this case, the statistics for co-occurrencein the target language English text denotes thatthe most frequent pair is 'court-judge', because theword ~COllr|' also lneans a qaw court'.

The proposed methodgives us a way to select tile expression with thehighest frequency of the target language text thatkeeps high frequency of the source language textat tim same time, so it overcomes the difficulty ofthe method using the frequency data on the targetlanguage text only, because it does not select theexpression with the highest frequency of only thetarget language text.~The subject phrase "watashi-wa" = T is omittedin this sentence.AcrEs DE COLlNG-92, NANT .ES, 23-28 AObq" 1992 5 2 7 PRec.

Figurc 1and 2 are examples of Japanesc~Engllsh transla-tion.
In Figure 1, with only statlstic,t\] data onthe target language text, ~court' may be chosen asan equivah;nt ranslation of "kooto" because timpair of 'eonrt- judge' co-occurs most frequeatly inthe target language.
However with DMAX Cr i terio, the equivalent translation of "kooto" is selectedcorrectly.?
The expression which co-occurs with "kooto"most frequently in the source language is?
The pair of the equivalent translation of"kooto" and the one of "nekutai" which co-occurs most frequently in the target languageis 'coat tie'.?
As a result, "kooto" is translated into 'coat'.It is the same ms shown in Figure 2.
A pairof 'basket ball' co-occurs most frequently in thetarget language.
But using DMAX Criteria, giv-ing attention first to the most frequent pair in thesource language text, "kotori-kago" cart gain thecorrect equivalent translation 'cage'.
Next, a pairof "mizu-booru" decides 'bowl' as an equivalenttranslation of "booru'.
Finally, correct rauslationcan be acquired in this way.Figure 3 shows the translation proct.~s and thestatistics for co-occurrence of another English~Japanese tr~tnslation example.~NG: The coiling of the court wascleaned quite well.#JAP: Saibansho no tenjoo~wacourt of ceiling subj.

But using DMAX Criteria,'ceiling' is selected as a basis for the equivalenttranslation selection of 'court', and "saibansho" isselected as an equivalent translation of 'court'  bythe comparison between statistics for co-occurrenceon the pairs of "tenjoo-saibansho" and "tenjookooto'.4 Calculation of LinguisticStatistics for SemanticInterpretationIn language understanding systems or machinetranslation systems throngh semantic expressions,one suitable meaning must be selected out of theones described in a dictionary according to an entryword.
However in conventional systems the mean-ing selection mechanism isn't robust and cannotselect the most suitable meaning only by logicalrestrictions described in the dictionaries.
We pre-sented a new method for the equivalent ransla-tion selection in the former chapter using statis-tical data on source language and target languagethrough bilingual dictionary.
To apply this methodto meaning selection, it is necessary to calculatestatistical data on the pairs of each meaning in ad-vance, but there is no means of calculating themautomatically.We have already devdoped an interlingua-based machine translation system whose interlin-gun named PIVOT doesn't depend on arty par-ticular natural language \[Muraki 86, ichiyama89, Okumura 91\].
In its dictionary, a.s illus-trated in Figure 4., expressions in the source lan-guage are mapped onto some interlingua vocab-ularies (CONCEPTUAL-PRIMITIVE:CP),  whichare next mapped onto some equivalent translations.Then we propose a new method of computing lin-guistic statistics for occurrence of meanings auto-matically using this format of dictionary.Suppose linguistic statistics on the pairs of ex-pressions in both source and target language textshave already been calculated.
In case of transla-tion, when an expression Si occurs in the sourcelanguage text, an equivalent translation Ti j  k is de-cided through the passage of Si :=*'Cij ~T i j~,  andas a result, CPCIj  is also selected from the CPscorresponding to the expression Si.
Therefore, thelinguistic statistics on the pairs of CPs or meaningsis nothing but coupling linguistic statistics on thepairs of corresponding exl)ressions in the target lan-guage text.
Thus, the linguistic statistics ~Z on thepairs of the meaning expressions in the dictionarycan be obtained as the sum of the linguistic statis-tics w on the pairs of target language oxpressiousaccording to the following equation.f i (C. , ,Cb, , )  = ~wm(Ta.,v,T~,,,q)p,qThis linguistic statistics can be added to the dic-tionary in advance  I and we c~n select the meaningin the same way as equivalent translation selection.5 ConclusionWe lu'oposed a new method DMAX Criteria(Double Maximize Criteria based on Dual Corpora)in this paper.
It can select a suitable equivalenttranslation or meaning using the statistical dataextracted from both source and target languagecorpora even when linguistic restrictions describedin the dictionary or grammar cannot.
The dependency relation in the source language is reflectedin the translated text through bilingual dictionary.Moreover, the nmthod has the following features:1.
It utilizes linguistic statistics as context in fermotion in addition to logical restrictions effec-tive for ambiguity resolution.2.
The source of the linguistic statistics is thedual corpora of source and target languages,not the bilingual corpora (the target languagetext doesn't have to be the translation of thesource language text).3.
The linguistic statistics can be coml)uted send-automatically in advance.4.
Tim linguistic statistics on the pairs of mean-ing expressions are computed from the lin-guistic statistics in source and target languagetexts with the interlingua-based bilingmd dic-tlonary to resolve ambiguity in meaning inter-.pretation.Based on this method, we have carried out anexperinmnt on a limited-scale translation system,attd confirmed eti~ctiveness of the method.
We arepreparing further experiments on a large-scMe dualcorpora with PIVOT interlingua dictionary.
