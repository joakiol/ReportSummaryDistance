Segment-Based Acoustic Models with Multi-level SearchAlgorithms for Continuous Speech RecognitionMari Ostendorf J. Robin RohlicekBoston University BBN Systems and Technologies Corp.Objective:The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independentrecognition of continuous peech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate foruse with these models.
The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic,segment-based models that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (featurevectors) that correspond to a phoneme.
Since the use of segment models is computationallycomplex, we will also investigate multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficientsearch.
Furthermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higher-order information.
This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF.Summary of Accomplishments:?
Refined the stochastic segment model to model time correlation using a Markov timestructure and using time-dependent parameter reduction.?
Investigated the utility of sentence-level duration phenomena for incorporation i  amulti-level algorithm.?
Investigated robust covariance stimates for limited training data.?
Developed a speaker-independent phoneme classification system that achieves 72%accuracy on the TIMIT database.?
Implement segment-based and HMM-based phoneme recognition systems to betterunderstand the relative advantages of these modelling techniques.?
Evaluate further efinements o the stochastic segment model such as use of different pa-rameter estimation methods, alternative variable-to-fixed-length transformations, andincorporation of context modelling.?
Implement a multi-level, iterative search algorithm for phomeme recognition.446
