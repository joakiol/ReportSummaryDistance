INTRODUCIDRY Pd~4ARKSThe elaboration of advanced user-computer dialoguesystems requires the cc~m%mication la~ to be inves-tigated and formalized.
This d~n of research hasnot yet been officially acknowledged as a part ofcomputational linguistics.
HzDwever, developing theformal models of speech interaction requires totake into account not only linguistic but c~ca-tire competence also.
That is necessary for creat-ing natural-language systems as ~ i i  as any cc~l i -cated systam of "natural" dialogue, and especiallyimportant in view of constructing new generationcomputers intended for mass non-programming users.We propose here a draft scheme of the model formaliz-ing the structure of c~,~nicative context in dia-logue interaction.
The relationships between the in-teracting partners are considered as a system ofthree automata.
TWo of them represent the agents ofthe dialogue and the third one is a model of theworld including the envirorm~_nt of interaction andother agents if they participate.
The autcrnaton-agentis the central con~ponent of the communicative compe-tence model.
We divide m~nory of each agent intoextracommunicative and cut~t~nicative parts.
The lat-ter directly concerns with the relationships betweenthe agents in projection onto the interaction pro-cess.Two restrictions have been accepted to simplify themodel.
(a) C~i,u~nicative ccrmpetences of both the agents,i.e.
their beliefs about ccr~munication laws and ac-tual state of their relations are identical just upto current communicative act (CA) because the con-tents of the act (including the cc~cat ive  con-tents) at the moment of its producing is known tothe speaker only.
(b) Receiver extracts from CA just the same informa-tion the speaker implies.2.
INITIAL N317/)NSWe shall introduce necessary notions and notations.Let {M} be a set of all propositions reflectingthe possible states of the three automata withinthe model, and M be a memory representing theagents' mutually coordinated beliefs about theworld.
State of M at moment z (i.e.
M ) is aconsistent subset of propositions from {~},  eachof which being characterized by index of certainty.The machinery of interaction between the agents isdcatinated by a systE~a of c o n t r a c t s. Herecontracts represent all kinds of human-to-human re-lationships (social, interpersonal, business, etc.
)For example, "chief-subordinate", "official-client","friends", "married couple", "patron-ward", etc.Contractis_represented with a tuplek, X, Y. Cond, Cond-Act, Cond-Des, T,wherek is a name of contract;and Y are roles of partners X and Y in thecontract;Cor~, Cond-Act and Cond-Des are consistentsubsets of propositions from {M}, called generalconditions, conditions of activation and conditionsof desactivation of the contract, respectively;T is a set of interact/on topics related togiven contract.The interaction between the agents is realized bymeans of communicative acts (CA), in particular,of speech acts.
Every CA is characterized with roles(author-receiver), aim, topic and value of phasefunction indicating the relation between CA and thetopic (CA can be initiating, continuing, closingand re-initiating in respect to its topic).
A sub-sequence of coherent cL~municative acts connectedwith the sane topic is called a t-i n t e r a c t-i ng .
Discourse is considered as a system of ~a-bedded t-interactings.
The simplest t-interacting274may consist of a single CA which simultaD~ouslyinitiates and closes its own topic (for example,CA requiring no reaction fran the receiver).
Topicis represented here by the following tuplet, X, Y, Cond, Aim, Scr, Cnsq,wheret is a name of topic;X, Y and Cond have the same meaning as forcontract in the above definition;Scr is a set of s c r i p t s of t-inter-actings which realize the topic t (a script iseither a single CA being the simplest t-interact-ing mentioned above or a chain of correlated ~m-bedded subtopics, respectively); the scripts inScr may he just listed or/and specified by meansof a formal generative procedure;Cnsq is a set of all possible consequencesof closing t, i.e.
a set of modifications of them~nory M resulting fran t-interactings which rea-lize the potential scripts of Scr;Aim is a subset of Cnsq which conventionallyis considered as the aim of agent initiating thetopic t.Initiating some topic t the agent chooses sanescript from Scr he plans to realize; in generalcase a script allows several possible continuationsat every intermediate point of its realization,one of these continuations corresponds to thescript the agent plans to realize at the given mo-ment.3.
OCX4~%~CATIVE CONTEXTThus the ccm~micative competence of the agentsis defined by the set {M} of propositions, theset {K} of contracts and the set {T} of topicspossible for X and Y.
To demonstrate the func-tioning of our model we shall consider the compo-nent of M related directly to the process of ccm-n~/nication.
This component being called Ccrnmunica-tive Context (CC), includes:- a set Tr of current topics, i.e.
the topicsinitiated before a nu,ent T and not closed yet,to each topic t H T current script of its reali-zation is put in correspondence.
The topics belong-ing to TT are hierarchically embedded so thatthe topic t is embedded into the topic t' (or t'is on higher level than t) if t is initiatedaccording to the current script of t'; a currenttopic/script which CA,:_ 1 belongs to,will be re-ferred as actual topic/script;- a set K T of contracts being in the activatedstate for the agent at the moment r;- a subset +KtC  K T of contracts related tothe topics included--in TT; i.e.
the contracts im-mediately related to the contents of the interac-tion.The transformation of K T is defined by the fol-lowing rules (for each k 6 K) ;(a) if Cond-Act (MT) and k E K r is true, thenthe contract k is included into KT+I;(b) if (k E KT)&(COndk(MT)=false), i.e.
conditionsof the contract k are not fulfilled, the contractk is excluded from KT+ 1 ;(c) if Cond-DeSk(Mr)~k E K T is true, the contractk is excluded from KT+I; it does not mean thatCond-Des k (M T ) - NO Cond k (M T ) takes place.The rules (a) and (b) require Cond-Actk(MT)--Cond k (M~).For the contracts in K a system of relationscan be defined, for example: contracts kl and k2are mutua l ly  incompat ib le  ifCOndk1&Condk2=false; kl is ~ n c o m p a-t i b 1 e with k2 if (k2 6'KTVCondk2(~)) -(Cond-DeSkl (M~)V NO Condkl);kl implies k2 if(CondklV Cond-ACtkl)- Cona-ACtk2 or k16Kt~Cond--ACtk2 (M T).The main scheme of the considered machinery of com-munication can be described as follows.
A currentstate M~ causes agent (X) to set scme goal; Xfonts a plan to achieve the goal and begins to rea-lize it.
Some step of X's plan demands to involvethe partner Y: to perform definite action or toaccept sane proposition as valid or to provide in-formation needed, etc.
To get this result is theaim of X at the given step of this plan.
To gainthe aim, X should choose an appropriate topic(one of the topics with this aim).
In the simplestcase it is possible to use just the next topic tin the script of the higher level topic with anaim being more general in the X's plan than thecurrent one.
In this situation initiating the sub-topic t produces minimal modification of CC(which is adding t to T) and does not modify theset K of the activated contracts and its subset+K.
In more complex cases to initiate an appropri-te topic t it is necessary to include in +K oneof contracts from K/+K or even to activate sc~enew contract k', i.e.
to include k' in K. Clos-ing a current topic t may produce sane consequen-ces ~ C~sqt with the corresponding modifica-tion of M which can lead to- the end of c~,,~unication,- a new goal for X and/or Y,- moving to the next subgoal in the current plan.In the next section we shall consider the spectrumof possible situations related with realization ofcurrent CA.4.
MODELLING THE PROCESSEach current act CA r may be initiating, continu-ing or closing with respect to embedding topic tbelonging to T T .The initiation of the topic t by CA~ may corres-pond to three different types of situations: "nor-mal order", "interruption with return", and "inter-ruption without return".
(a) Normal order covers the following situations:- the previous act CAT- 1 has closed the topic t"and the topic t is the next in the script the to-pic t' belongs to; if t' closes simultaneouslyseveral consecutively embedded topics, then t isthe next topic of the script of the lowest unclosedtopic;- CAT- 1 has closed one of the highest-level to-pics belonging to TT- I, then (i) t belongs toone of the contracts frcm +Kr_ I or (ii) the contr-act k has been activated, but not included into+Kr_ I (i.e.
k 6 K./+K~), or (iii) t activatesa new contract k E~ } and includes it into K Tand +K T (that is possible if the initiation of t275nt munent z leads to fulfillment Cond-Act k (Mw) ;(b) Interruption with return covers the followingsituations: the topic of the act CAT- 1 b~s nobbeen closed yet, but t is another topic of thesame or another contract; if a change of topic ismarked by "interruption with return", then this"deviation" is necessary either (i) for continuingthe interzzA0ted topic (return after some previousinterruption), or (ii) for the realization of thehigh-priority aim related to the new topic t;(c) interruption without return covers the situa-tions described in (b) but without the "return"mark as well as the following situation: the topicof the act CA~_ 1 is not closed and t is thenext topic of the same or higher-level script; theinterlnlption withot~t retttr~% us1~lly means by de-fault that the interrupted topic is considered tobe closed with success or failure depending on theinterrupted and new topics).The act CA~ ccntinued actual tepic t may be rea-lized in situations related to the normal order orto the return after interruption.
(a) normal order means that CA~ continues thetopic of the previous act CA~_ 1 ;(b) return after interruption means that CA~ con-tinues the topic remained to be unclosed ur~ "theinterruption with return".
The topic t beingclosed by the act CAT, some or all modificationslisted in Cnsqt take place in the m~r~ry M. Thesem:~ifications reflected in MT+ 1 can cause the fol-lowing situations:(a) KT+I = K T , i .e.
no contracts are activated ordesactivated, the current script of the actual to-pic and higher-level topics are not alternated;(b) KT+I = KT, but one/some of the current scriptsare alternated;(c) contract k is closed (i.e.
Cond-Desk(M~+l) =truth) ;(d) other contracts are c loud  and/or activated.The work presented is the part of the integral pro-ject on the lanquage interaction model being elabo-rated in our laboratory.The authors believe the system of the notions pre-sented may be used as a basis for forming the commu-nicative comp3nent in the dialogue systems includ-ing the natural-language interfaces.~CESI.
