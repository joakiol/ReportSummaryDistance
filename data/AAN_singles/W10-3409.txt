Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex 2010), pages 56?65,Beijing, August 2010Computational Lexicography: A Feature-based Approach in Designing an E-dictionary of Chinese ClassifiersHelena H. Gao Nanyang Technological Universityhelenagao@ntu.edu.sgAbstractChinese noun classifiers are obligatory as a category in association with nouns.
Conventional dictionaries include classifiers as lexical entries but explanations given are very brief and thus hardly helpful for L2 learners.
This paper presents a new design of an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers.
The design is based on both theoretical studies of Chinese classifiers and empirical studies of Chinese classifier acquisition by both children and adults.
My main argument with regards to Chinese classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies with a bottom-up approach are the key to the understanding of the complexity of classifier and noun associations.
The noun-dependent semantic features of classifiers are evidence to support my argument.
These features are categorically defined and stored in a separated database in an e-learning environment linked to the e-dictionary.
The aim of making such a design is to provide a platform for L2 learners to explore and learn with a bottom-up approach the associations of classifiers with nouns.
The computational agent-based model that automatically links noun features to that of classifiers is the technical part of the design that will be described in detail in the paper.
Future development of the e-dictionary will be discussed as well.1 IntroductionNoun classifiers are a typical feature of Chinese that distinguishes itself from many other languages.
In simple terms, a classifier is a morpheme or word used to classify a noun according to its inherent semantic features.
Noun classifiers in Chinese are obligatory as a category of its own and used to specify a noun when it isused with a determiner or a numeral.
In other words, A Chinese classifier is never used independently.
It must occur before a noun with a numeral (e.g., yi ?one?, liang ?two?, san ?three?)
and/or a determiner (e.g., zhe ?this?, nei ?that?
), or certain quantifiers (e.g., ji ?how many?, mei ?every?).
Such a combination is referred to as a classifier phrase.
However, the definition of Chinese classifiers is not a simple one.
There are different types of classifiers in terms of their semantic functions.
Some of them carry the unique features of the Chinese language; others are representatives of classifier languages, and yet al of them have the grammatical functions of measure words, which are a universal category in all languages.
Due to the complexity of classifier functions, different definitions and classifications have been found.
However, generally speaking, classifiers refer to common properties of noun objects across domains and common relations of objects in the world, rather than to categories having to do solely with language-internal relations (Lucy, 1992).
Some researchers take a functional approach and define Chinese classifiers based on their grammatical functions.
For example, Chao (1968) divides classifiers into nine categories.
They are ?classifiers or individual measures?, ?classifiers associated with v-o?, ?group measures?, ?partitive measures?, ?container measures?, ?temporary measures?, ?standard measures?, ?quasi-measures or autonomous measures?, and ?measures for verbs of action?.
From his classification we can see that he does not distinguish the concept of a classifier from that of a measure word.
The advantage of such a classification is its inclusion of all the three types of classifiers mentioned above and being able to define them all as measure words, but the disadvantage is that those that are Chinese specific noun classifiers are all treated under the universal concept of measure words.
This may be easy for learners to understand the grammatical functions of Chinese classifiers but the ontological nature of noun objects that classifiers are associated with are56largely ignored.
In recent decades, researchers have started to take a cognitive approach to understand the links between nouns and classifiers and found it necessary to make a distinction between classifiers and measure words.
For instance, Tai & Wang (1990:38) state that ?A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun.
?
This definition makes a clear distinction between a classifier and a measure word, which is assumed to be helpful for L2 learners to have a better understanding of the cognitive basis of a classifier system.
This is because there are no measure words in English or other European languages that can also function as classifiers in the same sense as Chinese classifiers.
A recent study done by Gao (2010) has shown that Swedish adult learners of Chinese had a lower proficiency in classifier application than their general Chinese proficiency and that most of them were not aware of the difference between the concept of a classifier and that of a measure word.
Other previous studies on classifiers include descriptive and experimental studies of classifier systems of natural languages.
For example, some descriptive studies make typological surveys of classifier systems in different languages (e.g.
Allan, 1977; Lyons, 1977; Goddard, 1998); others provide semantic analysis of classifiers and their associated nouns (e.g.
Downing, 1993; Huang & Ahrens, 2003; Matsumoto, 1993), and some also propose that there is an ontological base on which classifiers and nouns are associated with (Sowa 2000; Philpot et al, 2003; Nichols et al, 2005).
Experimental studies using computer technology to apply findings of classifier knowledge to natural language processing (NLP) have provided a new approach for the semantic analysis of classifiers (e.g.
Nirenburg & Raskin, 2004; Hwang et al, 2007, Quek, 2010) and  for computer-assisted language learning (e.g.
Guo & Zhong, 2005).
However, no e-learning systems developed so far are found to be able to guide second language learners to use the semanticproperties to understand the links between classifiers and their associated nouns.
The emergence of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) provides language learners with a user-friendly and flexible e-learning tool.
CALL incorporates technology into the language learning process and also applies itself across a broad spectrum of teaching styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson & Haggstrom, 2006).
Its bidirectional and individualized features makes it possible for learners to use it effectively to improve different aspects of language skills (e.g.
Mallon 2006; Chang et al, 2008).
My idea of designing the e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL.
Empirical studies have shown that classifier learning is a big challenge for L2 learners of Chinese.
My argument with regards to Chinese classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies with a bottom-up approach are the key to the understanding of the complexity of classifier and noun associations.
Therefore, the design of the e-dictionary has a focus on guiding learners to explore the cognitive foundations of classifier-noun relations.
The e-learning system implemented in the e-dictionary is designed to promote self-paced accelerated learning.
It consists of a database of the decomposed semantic features of classifiers and their associated nouns.
These well-defined unique and non-unique features will help learners to take a cognitive approach to explore case by case the matched pairs of classifiers and nouns.
Currently the e-dictionary has included 168 noun classifiers and 680 nouns, of which 80 classifiers and 560 nouns have been analysed and entered into the e-learning database.
My aim is to define and include all Chinese classifiers and their associated nouns1 and eventually link them to the e-learning system.2 Multi-categorization of ClassifiersIn cognitive linguistics, categories are defined by groups of features and relationships within a same family.
From this viewpoint, the                                                            1 Eleven classifier dictionaries are consulted (see References).
The number of classifiers listed in them ranges from 143 to 422 and the number of associated nouns is from 388 to 8609.
However, if we follow Tai and Wang?s (1990) definition of classifiers, 178 of them are true classifiers.57occurrence of a noun with a particular classifier is dependent upon the categorical features of both nouns and classifiers.
However, the internal semantic network of categories may be ambiguous due to historical and social factors, which makes categorization dependent on not only noun referents?
intrinsic properties but also their functional and human perceptual ones.
In other words, classifier and noun associations encode as well human cognitive understandings of the real world entities.
As a result, classifiers are found to be able to link nouns cross-categorically.
That is, one single classifier can associate itself with a number of nouns from different noun categories and at the same time one single noun from certain categories can be associated with not one but two classifiers.
This multiple-categorization nature of classifiers complicates the classification of classifiers and nouns for the purpose of providing an effective learning strategy.
It is also virtually impossible for linguists to build a meta-theory for a systematic organization of any clear logical classifier-noun categories and thus hard for lexicographers to find an effective way to illustrate the semantic connections between classifiers and nouns.
However, one thing we are clear about is that the main obstacles in classifier acquisition are that the inhabited meaning associations in the nature of classifiers are opaque and that the complex classifier associations with nouns have caused noun categorizations to be linguistically unconventional.
Yet, from a cognitive viewpoint, these associations and categorizations can provide cognitive motivations to learners if we can provide a learning tool that allows them to pay attention to the pragmatic use of classifiers on a cognitive basis.3 Semantic Decomposition of Classifiers and NounsTable 1 is a demonstration of the semantic features of some most commonly used noun classifiers and their associated nouns.
A total of 168 classifiers are collected and sorted out according to the number of noun categories each classifier is associated with.
One special feature of this dictionary design is that the classifiers?
associated nouns are grouped into categories based on the real-world entities as nounreferents.
Currently I have defined the following 11 categories in the e-dictionary:  ?nature, humans & body parts?, ?animals?, ?vegetables & fruits?, ?man-made objects?, ?buildings?, ?clothing?, ?food?, ?furniture?, ?tools?
and ?vehicles?.
A hierarchy of noun classifiers is built up according to the number of noun categories they enter into.
For instance, the classifier liang occurs only in the ?vehicles?
category, (e.g.
car, lorry, bicycle, etc.).
Out of the 168 classifiers, 149 occur in fewer than 3 noun categories.
The cognitive mapping between these 149 classifiers and their associated nouns are straightforward.
Hence it is relatively easy for users to quickly have a big picture of how a classifier is associated with certain type(s) of nouns.
For the rest of 19 classifiers listed in Table 1, each occurs in at least 3 noun categories.
At the current stage my work focuses on individual noun classifiers; the other types of classifiers will be added in the future when more people are involved in the project.
In the e-learning part of the dictionary, I temporarily exclude the general classifier ge because cognitively it is not assumed to be a difficult one to learn.
Through semantic decomposition, the cognitive mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns is revealed.
Take the classifier tiao for example.
It is associated with nouns such as rainbow, leg, snake, cucumber, road, scarf, potato chip, boat and necklace, which are from 9 of the 11 noun categories listed above.
Despite of the different categories they belong to, the 9 nouns share one same cognitive property ?
the shape of the noun referents that is defined as ?longitudinal?.
This shows that the classifier tiao is inhabited with this semantic feature as a cognitive basis and links itself to the nouns accordingly.
Similarly, the classifier gen is connected to the nouns such as stick, bone, banana, pillar, sausage, needle, and ribbon that belong to 7 noun categories respectively.
These nouns possess the same ?longitudinal?
feature as tiao.
This shows that extracting one same feature from gen and tiao is not helpful enough for learners to understand the difference between the two classifiers, though classifying nouns into categories can constrain the interference to learners to some extent.
What needs to be carried58out is to define each noun with a unique feature of its own, no matter whether they are from its lexical semantic meanings, pragmatic functions, or human perceptions.
For instance, besides ?longitudinal?, ?for supporting walking?
is added as a feature to stick, ?a piece of human skeleton?
to bone, ?turns from green to yellow when ripe?
to banana, ?one end stuck to the ground?
to pillar, etc.
More are needed until finally each noun is distinguished from other nouns that are associated with the same classifier.
These feature extractions and definitions are the core part of the database for the e-learning tool linked to the e-dictionary.4.
Methodology4.1.
Application of cognitive strategies in noun classifier acquisition  In this section we describe an approach that can enhance the practical use of the classifier dictionary.
Developed in the software environment of FileMaker Pro 8.5 (see Figure 2), the dictionary is established within a database system.
Categorical records created as data files are used to store the associated nouns.
The records created so far include 11 categories of nouns described in Section 3.
Such a categorization appears explicit, but its top-down approach fails to reveal the feature-based mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns.
However, the e-learning part of the dictionary can guide learners to search for correct classifier and noun pairs by looking for the defined features of the noun referents in a different database, firstly from those broadly defined as ?animacy?, ?shape?, ?size?, ?thickness?, ?length?, ?function?, etc., to those specific ones extracted from each particular noun referent.
With such a bottom-up approach, the e-dictionary allows users to learn the particular interrelated features of a classifier and its associated noun referents in a case-by-case fashion.
In this way, learners can better understand the point that a classifier reflects the cognitive classification of its associated noun referents.
Each individual record thus contains both general and specific information of a classifier and its associated nouns as data entries.
The features decomposed from the nounreferents are defined and recorded as independent data entries linked to the e-learning tool.
For instance, if a learner wants to know which classifier is the correct one for boat, he can enter the word  boat, finds its category as ?vehicles?, choose its shape as ?longitudinal?.
Then, tiao should automatically pop up in this case because boat is the only noun referent from the ?vehicles?
category (see Table 2).
In other cases where there are two or more items that are featured as ?longitudinal?, the learner will be guided to look for a more specific or unique feature with a few more clicks on the users?
interface.
The e-learning environment in the dictionary also provides learners the noun-classifier phrases that are commonly used but they may not be easy for learners to acquire.
Take the noun classifier zhi for example.
It is associated with noun referents that belong to ?animals and body-parts?, and ?man-made objects?, such as bird, hand, pen, etc.
The unique perceptual features of these noun referents are identified and built into the e-learning system so that users can click different categories in the interface to make particular associations as long as they have some general knowledge of the entities, such as their functions and perceptual features, etc.4.2 Implementation of Agent-based Model in Classifier E-learningThe e-learning tool in our classifier e-dictionary is targeted for automatic classifier-noun associations.
By adopting an agent-based model (Holland, 1995), we2 have developed a classifier-noun network for learners to learn step by step classifier phrases.
Included in the prototype model will be nouns and classifiers, divided into two groups of agents.
To design a semantic interface between the two types of agents with a computational approach, a tag is attached to each agent.
The tags are of opposite polarity, one to a noun, and the other to a classifier.
Each tag is a pseudo-binary-bit string of {0, 1, #}, where ?#?
is the ?doesn?t care?
symbol.
The position a symbol occupies in the string corresponds to a particular semantic feature of the agent, with ?#?
2 Acknowledgements to Ni Wei my research assistant for his contributions to the technical experiment and grants from Nanyang Technological University that supported preparation of this paper.59indicating that the corresponding feature is not critical for the formulation of the classifier phrase, even though the noun referent owns such a feature.
When a noun agent meets a classifier agent, we line up the two tags and match the digits in one string with those in the other position by position.
To report a match score at the end of this comparison, there are three match rules to follow: (i) it scores 1 given there is a match between two ?1?s or between two ?0?s; (ii) it scores 0 given there is a match between a ?1?
and a ?#?
or a ?0?
and a ?#?
or between two ?#?s; (iii) it scores -1 given there is a match between a ?1?
and a ?0?.
The aggregate match score indicates the likeliness of a correct classifier phrase with the involved classifier and the noun.
More specifically, in this model each tag consists of 4 pseudo-binary bits.
Out of the noun?s many semantic features, let?s selectively represent two of them: the first feature with the first two symbols, and the second with the last two.
For example, a tag ?1100?
is assigned to the agent (noun) leg to represent the noun?s features defined as ?longitudinal?
and ?body-part?
respectively.
In this case, ?longitudinal?
might be considered as the most salient feature of leg with regards to the selection of a classifier.
Hence, it is represented by ?11?.
On the other hand, if ?longitudinal?
is by no means an external or internal feature of the associated noun referent, the symbols at the corresponding positions would be ?00?.
Other possible combinations of symbols such as ?01?
and ?10?
are reserved for fuzzy states, which are associated with marginally accepted classifier phrases.
Besides, the noun referent leg also has a ?body-part?
property listed, but it is not of primary importance for finding its classifier match.
Therefore, it is represented by ?##?
at the last two string positions, rather than explicitly indicated by any of the four combinations mentioned above.
We assign the tags to classifier agents in a similar way.
For instance, ?11##?
may be assigned to the classifier tiao, due to the fact that tiao often occurs in a classifier phrase with nouns defined as having ?longitudinal?
features.
On the other hand, ?##11?
may be assigned to the noun classifier zhi, which is commonly applied to noun referents of body-part.Regarding the agent?s interaction with those agents of classifiers, when the tag ?1100?
of leg is compared with the tag ?11##?
of the agent tiao, the match score is 1+1+0+0 = 2.
In contrast, its match score with the tag ?##11?
of the agent zhi is reported as 0+0+0+0 = -2.
The match score 2 indicates tiao is more likely to be linked to leg, and the match score -2 implies an undesirable match between leg and zhi.
It is noteworthy, however, that if a user assigns ?1111?
to leg, they will obtain a match score of 2 (0+0+1+1) with zhi.
They will hence conclude that, beside tiao, zhi is another correct classifier for leg.
In addition, we include the defined features of nouns and classifiers as a group of interactive agents.
This group is designed to facilitate the learning process from learner?s perspective.
Take L2 learners for example.
First they may learn that tiao is the correct classifier for leg because the noun referent of leg has the longitudinal attribute.
Next, they tend to look for other nouns with the longitudinal feature, such as necklace and snake, and to verify whether tiao is also the correct classifier for these nouns.
By establishing the mapping between the defined features of nouns and classifiers, the agent-based model explicitly shows learners the possible connections between these groups of agents.
Among the semantic features, some are defined as unique features which distinguish their corresponding nouns from the rest of the nouns?
group.
For instance, we may define ?chained jewel?
as the unique feature of a necklace, and ?limbless reptile, some of which produce venom?
as that of a snake (see Figure 1).
We assign two kinds of tags respectively, one for non-unique feature agents and the other for unique feature agents.
Each non-unique feature agent is attached with an adhesion tag (Holland, 1995).
This adhesion tag provides the possibility of forming multi-feature agent aggregates with individual unique feature agents.
On the other hand, each unique semantic feature is attached with a two-segment tag.
The first segment plays the same role as the classifier/noun tag, which controls the agent?s interaction with agents of other groups, i.e.
nouns and noun classifiers.
The second segment functions simply as an adhesion tag.
To decide whether to form a multi-feature agent aggregate, we can match a non-unique feature agent?s adhesion tag and the second60segment of a unique feature agent?s tag.
The match score is calculated in a similar way with that between noun?s agents and classifier?s agents.
To simplify the discussion, we assume that adhesion only occurs between one unique feature agent and one or more non-unique feature agents.
In other words, adhesion does not occur between either two unique feature agents or two non-unique feature agents.
To explicitly show the cognitive mapping between classifiers/nouns and their features, we use a collection of condition/action if-then rules (Holland, 1995).
In our model, both the condition and the action are linguistic variables, which are in turn represented by pseudo-binary-bit strings.
The rules represent the interconnection among the agent group of classifiers, the agent group of nouns, and the group of defined features.
For instance, the same noun classifier tiao occurs in the classifier phrase yi tiao xianglian ?a necklace?.
Let ?, ?
and ?
respectively denote the features of ?chained jewel?, ?man-made?, and ?longitudinal?, where ?
is the unique feature to identify the noun referent of necklace.
As discussed previously, the individual features?, ?, and ?
can form a multi-feature agent aggregate, which we denote as ???.
The if-then Rule 1 can be implemented as:  Rule 1: {If (???)
Then (necklace)}.
Following the tag interaction approach discussed previously in this section, Rule 2 can be implemented to reflect the inter-agent communication between the noun and its classifier:  Rule 2: {If (necklace) Then (tiao)}.
Based on these two rules, Rule 3 can be implemented as   Rule 3: {If (???)
Then (tiao)}.
Note that Rule 3 has the same input (condition) with Rule 1 and the same output (action) with Rule 2.
Rule 1 outputs its action as a message, which is subsequently received by Rule 2 as its condition.
This is an example of transitivity, a property of the rule-based network.
The condition and action part in each of the threerules could also be exchanged to implement three inverse rules.
Now let?s take a look at the noun snake and its classifier tiao.
Given that ?
represents ?animate?
and ?
represents ?limbless reptile, some of which produce venom?, we can retrieve?, ?, ?
from the features?
group and form them as another multi-feature agent aggregate as???.
Here ?
is the unique feature of snake.
We add another three if-then rules concerned with snake and tiao as follows:  Rule 4: {If (???)
Then (snake)}; Rule 5: {If (snake) Then (tiao)}; Rule 6: {If (???)
Then (tiao)}.
So far only multi-feature agent aggregate, rather than single feature agents are used as conditions.
It is also noteworthy that non-unique feature agents are incapable of interacting directly with noun agents or classifier agents, since their adhesion tags cannot be matched with the classifier/noun tags.
The property of transitivity implies, however, that we can establish the mapping between nouns and non-unique feature agents indirectly.
For example, we represent the relation between the noun necklace and the unique feature agent ?
?chained jewel?
by Rule 7 as follows:  Rule 7: {If (necklace) Then (?)}
We also represent the relation between the noun snake and the unique feature agent ?
?limbless reptile, some of which produce venom?
by Rule 8 as follows:  Rule 8: {If (snake) Then (?)}
Either ?
or ?
is related with the non-unique feature agent ?
?longitudinal?, which could be represented by Rule 9 & 10.
Rule 9: {If (?)
Then (?)}
Rule 10: {If (?)
Then (?)}
The mapping between necklace/snake and the non-unique feature agent ?
?longitudinal?
could then be implemented by Rule 11 & 12.61Rule 11: {If (necklace) Then (?)}
Rule 12: {If (snake) Then (?)}
In Rule 11 and 12, the noun is taken as the input and the non-unique semantic feature as the output.
By swapping the two kinds of agents?
roles in the message-processing rules, we may inversely implement Rule 13 by taking the non-unique feature as the input and the noun as the output.
If a learner chooses ?
as the single input agent, two possible outputs pop up for his/her selection.
Rule 13: {If (?)
Then (necklace or snake)}  More rules could be added in the classifier network by selecting different agents from the three groups in a similar way as we implement Rule 1-13.
In this way the if-then rule-based network explicitly shows the cognitive mapping between the classifiers and their associated nouns.
Learners will find out the association between the target words and their features, which are essential for their classifier acquisition.
So far we have tested some commonly used classifiers and their associated nouns selected from the e-dictionary and tried within the agent-based model.
The automatic matching is successful, though more pairs need to be tested.5.
ConclusionThis paper presents a feature-based approach in designing a classifier e-dictionary with an e-learning environment created for learners to use cognitive strategies to explore and learn the classifier phrases.
The current dictionary is based on a database with classes of nouns (11 classes at present) and classifiers (168 added) that are stored as individual records.
The records are not organized according to the lexical meanings of the words.
Instead, the classification scheme is based on the noun referents?
semantic and salient external or functional features.
The objective of the design is to use such features to set up a classifier network that can automatically associate all possible nouns.
A computer-based model with such a design is expected to show learners of Chinese the cognitive base of linguistic combinations.
The proposed agent-based model uses the matchbetween pseudo-binary-bit strings to indicate the probability of interactions between agents.
It hence predicts how likely a classifier and a noun occurs in a classifier phrase.
The relations among the agent groups are shown within the framework of the if-then rule-based network.
Learners can explore case by case, when using the dictionary?s e-learning function, the classifier and noun associations and the defined features that the associations are based on.
The future task is to include the rest of the classifiers and all possible associated nouns.
Linguistically, a challenge to carry out the task would be the definitions of the unique features of the noun referents and their classifiers that have fuzzy boundaries.
Technically, the challenge would be the solution to making perfect matches of those cases where one classifier agent as input is expected to link automatically a number of noun agents as output, which should follow a step-by-step procedure that is interesting and effective from learners?
