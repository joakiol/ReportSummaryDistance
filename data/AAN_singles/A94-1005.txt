Machine Translation of Sentences with Fixed ExpressionsNaoto Katoh 1 Teruaki AizawaNHK Science and Technical Research Laboratories1-10-11, Kinuta, Setagaya-ku,Tokyo 157, Japan{ katonao, aizaw a } @ strl.nhk, or.jpAbstractThis paper presents a practical machine translation systembased on sentence types for economic news stories.Conventional English-to-Japanese machine translation(MT) systems which are rule-based approaches, are diffi-cult to translate certain types of Associated Press (AP)wire service news stories, such as economics and sports,because these topics include many fixed expressions ( uchas compound words or collocations) which are difficult obe processed by conventional syntactic analysis and/orword selection methods.The proposed MT system, an economic-news storiesmachine translation system (ENTS), can translate co-nomic news sentences with fixed expressions.
The systemconsists of three processes, to handle different ypes ofsentences, fixed type, economics-specific type and generaltype.
This paper focuses mainly on the translation methodfor fixed-type sentences, which is a kind of example-basedapproach.
In this translation method, fixed sentence trans-lation (STRA) data plays a key role.
The STRA data is aset of bilingual templates, which is built automaticallyfrom fixed English sentences and their Japanese transla-tion equivalents.
The fixed English sentences are extractedautomatically from the AP corpus.A series of experiments o evaluate ENTS using eco-nomic news in the AP news stories howed the translationaccuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conven-tional rule-based MT method.1 IntroductionWe are developing an English-to-Japanese machine trans-lation (MT) system to produce real-time rough translationsfor Associated Press (AP) wire service news stories.
Withsome news topics, troubles with fixed expressions lowsthe translation accuracy of the MT system.
Economicnews stories in particular are difficult to translate by con-ventional rule-based methods, because they contain manyfixed expressions sharing two major characteristics:cl) The fixed expressions produce conomics-specificsyntactic structure.c2) Equivalents of the fixed expressions require Japa-nese economic jargons.These characteristics respectively cause two major bot-tlenecks for the conventional rule-based MT system:bl) General-purpose grammatical rules are not suffi-cient to yield correct analysis of economic news stories.
(Simple addition of grammatical rules increases yntacticambiguities.
)b2) It is difficult to select the appropriate Japanesewords for the translation.Actually, these problems reduce the translation accu-racy of our rule-based MT system to only 20%, which istoo low for practical use.This paper presents a new English-to-Japanese MT sys-tem for economic news stories, which is called ENTS(Economic News stories machine Translation System), toprocess fixed expressions effectively.
ENTS consists ofthree sequential processes (as shown in Fig.
1), based onthe three basic types of economic news sentence.
Process 1is a kind of example-based approach, while Processes 2and 3 are rule-based ones that differ in grammatical rules.This paper focuses mainly on Process 1, which is com-posed of fixed sentence translation, compound word trans-lation, fixed sentence translation data production and fixedsentence xtraction, Fixed sentence translation data(STRA data), which is a kind of bilingual template, playsa key role in the fixed sentence translation.
The STRA datais built automatically from fixed English sentences ex-tracted from a large corpus and their corresponding Japa-nese translations.inputI Process 2Process 3Figure 1STRA : Fixed sentence translationCTRA : Compound word translationDTRA : Data production for STRAEXTRA : Fixed sentence extraction.

JAn overview of ENTS1Currently he is working at ATR Interpreting Telecom-munications Research Laboratories.28Recently, several example-based MTs were proposedfor processing fixed expressions \[Nagao841\[Sumita91 \].Furuse proposed a cooperative method using tightlywoven combination of example- and rule-based ap-proaches \[Furuse92\].
In contrast to their approach, we usethe two methods independently.
Therefore, the translationaccuracy of our example-based method is guaranteed tobe100%.Creating an example-based MT requires bilingual trans-lation data.
Kaji proposed acquiring the bilingual transla-tion data from bilingual texts \[Kaji92\].
However thatwould require a complete syntactic analysis of bilingualtexts.
Our method is more robust, because it requires onlya partial analysis.Section 2 describes some relevant features of economicnews stories.
In Section 3, we present an overview ofENTS.
The following sections describe the fixed sentencetranslation method in ENTS, and the results of experi-ments using ENTS for AP economic news stories.2 Features of economic news sentencesThe AP delivers about 350 wire-service news stories aday, of which about 50 are concerned with economics.Each news story has its own title related to the contents.Because the titles on economic news stories are fixed, suchstories can be selected easily.
Most sentences in theseeconomic news stories have fixed expressions comprisedof compound words and/or collocations.Example of fixed expressionsel) compound words"5 cents", "17.76 dollars per kilo",and "The U.S. dollar"e2) collocations"Malaysian tin closed at", "The U.S. dollar opened",and "as share prices rose"Based on the fixed expressions, the sentences in eco-nomic news stories, called economic sentences, are classi-fied into three types:Type I : Fixed sentencesExample 11-1) "In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 17.76dollars per kilo, up 5 cents.
"1-2) "In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 16.83dollars per kilo, up 19 cents.
"1-3) "In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian tin closed at 16.40dollars per kilo, down 8 cents.
"Type II : Economics-specific sentencesExample 22-1) "The U.S. dollar opened slightly higher against heJapanese yen Tuesday morning in Tokyo, while shareprices inched up.
"2-2) "The U.S. dollar drifted lower against he Japaneseyen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the TokyoStock Exchange rose sharply.
"2-3) "The U.S. dollar opened higher against he Japaneseyen in Tokyo Thursday, as share prices rose in early trad-ing.
"Type III : General sentencesExample 33-1 ) "Kagawa added, however, that the market still antici-pates a rising dollar.
"3-2) "Shigeru Sato, an analyst with Sanyo Securities, saidthe index fell some 65 points at one point in the afternoon,but last-minute arbitrage buying pulled it back up.
"3-3) "But Tobo said the market's basic sentiment remainedbearish because of a lack of incentives to focus on.
"(1) Type IThe sentences in Type I contain fixed expressions inwhich the words change a little form day to day.
The partsof speech of the translation equivalents of these fixed ex-pressions are nouns in Japanese.
For example, the transla-tion equivalents of compound words like "17.76 dollarsper kilo" are nouns, as are those of "up" and "down"in 1-1,2, 3.
The verb in a Type I sentence, such as "close" in ex-amples 1-1, 2, 3, is fixed.
(2) Type IIAlthough each sentence in Type II has a unique style withfixed expressions, there is a greater variety of fixed ex-pressions than that in Type I sentences.
For example:"opened" and "drifted"or "slightly higher", "lower" and "higher"The parts of speech of their translation equivalents ofthese fixed expressions are verb or adjective in Japanese.Therefore, their translation equivalences require aproduc-tion method of their inflections in Japanese generationprocess of MT.
(3) Type IIIThe Type IlI sentences have no features that make MTappropriate.
Most of the general sentences are dealers'comments.3 Outline of ENTSENTS consists of three translation methods correspondingto the types of economic sentences.
ENTS processing fol-lows the flow in Fig.
2.F igure 2 ENTS f low chart(1) Process 1Process 1 translates fixed sentences (Type I) using bilin-gual templates that directly handle fixed expressions.
(2) Process 2Process 2 translates sentences of Type II using a conven-tional rule-based approach with grammatical rules tunedto economic sentences obtained from two data worth ofAP stories \[Aizawa93\].
The grammatical rules are builtreflecting features of fixed expressions.
These economics-specific grammatical rules total about 500, which is 1/5 of29the number of rules for general sentences.
Therefore, thereare few ambiguities in syntactic structure.
(3) Process 3Process 3 translates those sentences not processed byProcess 1 or Process 2.
It is a rule-based MT with general-purpose grammatical rules.4 A translation method of fixedsentenceIn our translation method, STRA (a fixed SentenceTRAnslation method), the bilingual templates in whichtranslation equivalents of the fixed expressions are repre-sented as variables are created using STRA data.
Thatdata is built automatically by DTRA (a Data productionmethod for STRA) from fixed English sentences and theircorresponding Japanese translations.
The fixed Englishsentences are extracted automatically from a corpus byEXTRA (a fixed sentence EXTRAction method).
CTRA(a Compound word TRAnslation method) plays a mainrole in STRA and DTRA.Fig.

EXTRA : Fixed sentence extractionFigure 3 Fixed-sentence translation method4.1 Compound word translation (CTRA)The compound word translation module (CTRA) trans-lates compound words in fixed expressions \[Katoh91\].
InSTRA and DTRA, CTRA is the main processing unit,while it is used in one step of analysis in Processes 2 and 3.In our MT system used in Processes 2 and 3, the CTRAstep occurs between morphological nd syntactic analysesas shown in Fig.

~__ _ L _Idat~Figure 4 Our rule-based MT system withCTRACTRA extracts fixed expressions and defines their ap-propriate translation equivalents, the parts of speech andthe semantic markers.
For example, fixed expressions inexample 1-1 are processed as:idiomatic translation part of semanticexpression equivalents speech marker"17.76 dollars per kilo .... le~ ~ 17.76 ~')v" noun unit expression"5 cents" "5 ~ > I," noun unit expressionIn CTRA, English analysis is done by CHART parserbased on CFG rules which represent fixed expressions.On the other hand, Japanese generation is not based on arule-based method, but conducted by substituting thetranslation equivalents of the English words for variablesin Japanese templates.
Fig.

Boththese CFG rules and Japanese templates are named asCTRA data.English fixed expressions Japanese templates1: S--> UNTEXP r#1#\]2: UNTEXP--> UNTEXP PER UNIT \[- 1 #3##1#J3: --> NUMEXP UNIT \[#1##2#J4: UNIT --> "dollar", "cents", r b')l/.\] , I-~ 2 /b  / ,"kilo", "yen", etc \ [~  ~ J , \[\['qJ ...5: PER--> "per", "a" rJ6: NUMEXP--> "1", "12", etc \[-lJ , \[12J ""7: CMA--> "," \['J8: UPDW --> "up", "down" r T .

)Figure 5 Sample CTRA data4.2 Fixed sentence translation (STRA)The fixed sentence translation module (STRA) is an ex-panded CTRA with added CTRA data (named as STRAdata) for translating not only fixed expressions but alsofixed sentences.
STRA data is produced automatically, asdescribed in next section.An example of STRA data used to translate xample 1-1 in Section 2, are shown in Fig.

6 is an English tem-plate of example 1-1, and its corresponding translationwith variables is a Japanese template.
The CFG rules arebased not on English grammar but on an English sentencepattern, although they represent the word order of a fixedsentence.
For example, "Malaysian tin closed at", which isarranged in one phrase, cannot usually be represented asone grammatical category according to English grammar.The STRA data is flexible in its ability to translate fixedsentences.
For example, the STRA data shown in Fig.
6and the CTRA data in Fig.
5 can translate :1-4) "In Tokyo, Malaysian tin closed at 1941 yen per kilo,down 19 yen.
"into Japanese:1941H'd" O' ~" fz Jbecause, the fixed expressions in the examples arematched:Kuala Lumpur <---> Tokyo17.76 dollars per kilo <---> 1941 yen per kiloup <---> down5 cents <---> 19 yenTo make STRA data flexible, the words used in fixedexpressions, uch as "Kuala Lumpur", "Tokyo", "cents"and "yen", should be registered in CTRA data.
Thesewords are selected by hand, referring to frequently appear-ing fixed expressions collected from corpora.4.3 Data production for STRA (DTRA)A data production module for STRA (DTRA) buildsSTRA data automatically from English fixed sentencesand their Japanese quivalent sentences.
In DTRA, CFGrules are constructed by transforming English fixed sen-tences, and Japanese templates are made by replacingfixed expressions in their Japanese quivalent sentenceswith variables.
DTRA's algorithm is as follows:\[DTRA's Algorithm\]STEP0Translate a fixed sentence wl...wn into Japanese byhand.STEP 1CTRA makes candidate variables for a bilingual tem-plate.STEP2Define weights for the candidates by the algorithmshown in Fig.

)& (there is an equivalent inthe Japanese sentence.
)thenweight(i, j) = 3 j ielse thenweight(i, j) = 0Figure 7 Algorithm for calculating relativeweights of positionsIn STEP 0, a fixed sentence wl...wn is translated intoJapanese by hand.
STEP 1 collects candidates for vari-ables in the Japanese sentence.
Actually, the fixed sen-tence is analyzed by CTRA, and various fixed expressionsare extracted as symbols (pre-terminal or terminal sym-bols) used in non-active dges.
STEP 2 is to calculate theweights of the symbols by the algorithm shown in Fig.
7 toselect an optimal set of fixed expressions.
If the translationequivalent of a symbol exist in the Japanese quivalentsentence, its weight is defined according to the number ofwords in edges, otherwise it is zero.
STEP 3 selects anoptimal set of edges by calculating the maximum in sumsof the weights between positions 0 and n by DynamicProgramming (DP).
STEP 4 produces pre-terminal sym-bols for the word sequences not selected in STEP 3, andlines up the symbols in order of their appearance tomakeCFG rules.
In STEP 5, each translation equivalent of theedges in the optimal set is replaced with a variable in theJapanese quivalent sentence to make Japanese templates.DTRA is illustrated by processing sentence 1-1.STEP 0 translates the sentence into Japanese by hand:7 "y 7*O') 1 ~ t~ 17.76 F')I,"C O'~?t:JThe non-active dges obtained by CTRA in STEP 1 areshown in Fig.

The fixed-wordsequences are not only compound words such as "\[DIGIT\]dollars per kilo"(where \[DIGIT\] denotes digits) and "oncondition of anonymity", but also some parts of fixed ex-pressions, such as "said in a" and "condition of anonym-ity".
The fixed-word sequences are called "fixed patterns"and the compiled fixed patterns are called "fixed patterndata".Using fixed patterns, FPR is defined as follows:sum of words in fixed sequences of a sentenceFPR .

.the total number of words in a sentenceExample4-1) The NYSE's composite index rose 0.39 to 196.61.4-2) The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.33 to186.51.FPD1) "The NYSE's composite index rose \[DIGITI to\[DIGITI" (8 words),FPD2) "The NYSE's composite index"(4 words),FPD3) "\[DIGITI to IDIGITI"(3 words)FPD1, FPD2 and FPD3 are assumed to be in fixed patterndata.
Thus,The FPR of example 4-1 = 8/8 =1.0, because 4-1 itself isFPD1.The FPR of example 4-2 = (4+3)/9 = 0.78, because 4-2includes FPD2 and FPD3.Fixed sentences are defined as those with FWR valuesabove a certain threshold.
EXTRA analyze ach sentencein a corpus and extracts the sentences with sufficientlyhigh FPR as fixed sentences.EXTRA has three parameters:P1) range of fixed patternsP2) frequency of fixed patternsP3) threshold of FPR5 Exper iments5.1 Extracting fixed sentencesThe parameters for EXTRA were selected as:P1) 3 to 6 words in fixed patternsP2) more than 10 timesP3) 0.8To satisfy conditions P1 and P2, about 92,000 fixed pat-terns were collected from AP wire-service news storiesfrom a two-year period, which include about 1.6 millionsentences.
Using these fixed patterns, about 21,000 fixedsentences were extracted under the condition P3.
The ex-periment was not limited to economic news stories.
Ex-amples of the extracted results are shown in Appendix.Since most of the sentences are economic ones with manyidiomatic expressions, EXTRA would be a good methodenough to extract fixed sentences.5.2 Production of STRA dataThe 388 most frequently occurring economics-relatedfixed sentences were manually sampled from the 21,000fixed sentences.
After manually translating them intoJapanese, STRA data was produced by DTRA.While most of CFG rules in the STRA data include vari-ables, a few do not, such as for "Gold prices were mixed.
"The STRA data produced was as simple as:S --> PAT225 r#1 #\]PAT225 --> "Gold prices were mixed"The total number of symbols given in STEP 4, such asPAT1 and PAT2, are approximately 230.5.3 Exper iment for ENTSA series of experiments was conducted using the STRAdata discussed in Section 5.2 to evaluate the accuracy ofENTS.Table 1 and 2 show each process's volume and transla-tion accuracy, respectively for two data sets: Datal in-cludes 193 economic sentences used to tune to the CFGrules of Process 2, and data2 includes 167 sentences whichwere not used in the tuning.32dataldata2Table 1 Processing volume (%)Process 129.131.2Process 261.357.5Process 3 Total9.6 10011.3 100\[Uratani91\] Uratani, N., Katoh, N. and Aizawa T.: "Ex-traction of Fixed Patterns from AP Economic News" Proc.of 42nd Annual Convention of IPSJ, 6E-4 (1991 ) ; in Japa-nese.Table 2 Translation accuracy (%)data Idata2Process 11130100Process 270.158.7Process 3 Total10.2 73.022.2 66.3About 30% of each data set is translated in Process 1and its translation accuracy is 100% for both cases.
Thetranslation accuracy of Process 2 for data2 is so high as fordatal, although Process 2 is not tuned to data2.
The overalltranslation accuracy increases from about 20% with ourconventional MT system to about 70%.6 ConclusionWe described our new machine translation system(ENTS), which is an economics-specific MT system forprocessing fixed expressions.
We focused mainly on themethod of translating fixed sentences in ENTS.
The re-sults of experiments show that translation accuracy in-creases from 20% with our conventional MT to 70% withENTS.
We conclude ENTS will be effective for translat-ing AP economic news stories into Japanese.The processing rate in Process 1 will be improved byincreasing CFG rules in CTRA data and by collectingmore fixed sentences and their translation equivalents inDTRA.
Moreover we intend to apply the translationmethod to sports and general news stories.Appendix(FPR: extracted sentence)1.000: He did not elaborate.1.000: No injuries were reported.1.000; The U.S. dollar opened at 159.97 yen on the Tokyoforeign exchange market Monday, up from last Friday'sclose of 157.65 yen.1.000; The Federal Reserve Board's index measuring thevalue of the dollar against 10 other currencies weighted onthe basis of trade was 97.46 Tuesday, off 0.74 points or0.74 percent from Monday's 98.20.0.970: The average price for strict low middling 1 1-16inch spot cotton declined 99 points to 78.64 cents a poundWednesday for the seven markets, according to the NewYork Cotton Exchange.0.952: The Nikkei Stock Average closed at 25,194.10,down 48.30 points, or 0.19 percent on the Tokyo StockExchange Wednesday.References\[Aizawa93\] Aizawa, T., Katoh, N. and Kamata, M.: "Tun-ing of  a Machine Translation System to Wire-ServiceEconomic News", Proc.
