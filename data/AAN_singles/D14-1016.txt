Conventionalword alignment methods allow discontin-uous alignment, meaning that a source(or target) word links to several target (orsource) words whose positions are dis-continuous.
However, we cannot extrac-t phrase pairs from this kind of align-ments as they break the alignment con-sistency constraint.
In this paper, we usea weighted vote method to transform dis-continuous word alignment to continuousalignment, which enables SMT system-s extract more phrase pairs.
We carryout experiments on large scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English trans-lation tasks.
Experimental results showstatistically significant improvements ofBLEU score in both cases over the base-line systems.
Our method produces a gainof +1.68 BLEU on NIST OpenMT04 forthe phrase-based system, and a gain of+1.28 BLEU on NIST OpenMT06 for thehierarchical phrase-based system.1 IntroductionWord alignment, indicating the correspondencebetween the source and target words in bilingualsentences, plays an important role in statisticalmachine translation (SMT).
Almost all of the SMTmodels, not only phrase-based (Koehn et al.,2003), but also syntax-based (Chiang, 2005; Liuet al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), derive translationknowledge from large amount bilingual text anno-tated with word alignment.
Therefore, the qualityof the word alignment has big impact on the qual-ity of translation output.Word alignments are usually automatically ob-tained from a large amount of bilingual trainingcorpus.
The most widely used toolkit for wordalignment in SMT community is GIZA++ (Ochand Ney, 2004), which implements the well knownIBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HM-M model (Vogel and Ney, 1996).
Koehn et al.
(2003) proposed some heuristic methods (e.g.
the?grow-diag-final?
method) to refine word align-ments trained by GIZA++.
Another group of wordalignment methods (Liu et al., 2005; Moore etal., 2006; Riesa and Marcu, 2010) define featurefunctions to describe word alignment.
They needmanually aligned bilingual texts to train the mod-el.
However, the manually annotated data is tooexpensive to be available for all languages.
Al-though these models reported high accuracy, theGIZA++ and ?grow-diag-final?
method are domi-nant in practice.However, automatic word alignments are usu-ally very noisy.
The example in Figure 1 showsa Chinese and English sentence pair, with wordalignment automatically trained by GIZA++ andthe ?grow-diag-final?
method.
We find many er-rors (dashed links) are caused by discontinuousalignment (formal definition is described in Sec-tion 2), a source (or target) word linking to sev-eral discontinuous target (or source) words.
Thiskind of errors will result in the loss of many use-ful phrase pairs that are learned based on bilingualword alignment.
Actually, according to the defini-tion of phrases in a standard phrase-based model,we cannot extract phrases from the discontinuousalignment.
The reason is that this kind of align-ment break the alignment consistency constrain-t (Koehn et al., 2003).
For example, the Chi-1471{Imeiguo2?shi3?shaoshu4A?jige5?tou6exia7??fandui8?piao9de10I[guojia11?

The dashed linksare incorrect alignments.nese word ?shi2?1is aligned to the English words?was4?
and ?that10?.
However, these two Englishwords are discontinuous, and we cannot extract thephrase pair ?
(shi, was)?.In this paper, we propose a simple weighed votemethod to deal with the discontinuous word align-ment.
Firstly, we split the discontinuous align-ment into several continuous alignment group-s, and consider each continuous alignment groupas a bucket.
Secondly, we vote for each buck-et with alignment score measured by word trans-lation probabilities.
Finally, we select the buck-et with the highest score as the final alignment.The strength of our method is that we refine wordalignment without using any external knowledge,as the word translation probabilities can be esti-mated from the bilingual corpus with the originalword alignment.We notice that the discontinuous alignment ishelpful for hierarchical phrase-based model, as themodel allows discontinuous phrases.
Thus, forthe hierarchical phrase-based model, our methodmay lost some discontinuous phrases.
To solvethe problem, we keep the original discontinuousalignment in the training corpus.We carry out experiment with the state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based(Chiang, 2005) SMT systems implemented inMoses (Koehn et al., 2007).
Experiments on largescale Chinese-to-English and German-to-Englishtranslation tasks demonstrate significant improve-ments in both cases over the baseline systems.2 The Weighted Vote MethodTo refine the discontinuous alignment, we proposea weighted vote method to transform discontinu-ous alignment to continuous alignment by discard-ing noisy links.
We split discontinuous alignment1The subscript denotes the word position.into several continuous groups, and select the bestgroup with the highest score computed by wordtranslation probabilities as the final alignment.For further understanding, we first describesome definitions.
Given a word-aligned sentencepair (FI1, EJ1, A), an alignment set Aset(i) is theset of target word positions that aligned to thesource word Fii:Aset(i) = {j|(i, j) ?
A} (1)For example, in Figure 1, the alignment setfor the Chinese word ?shaoshu3?
is Aset(3) ={5, 7, 8, 10}.
We define an alignment s-pan Aspan(i) as [min(Aset(i)),max(Aset(i))].Thus, the alignment span for the Chinese word?shaoshu3?
is Aspan(3) = [5, 10].The alignment for Fiiis discontinuous if thereexist some target words in Aspan(i) linking to an-other source word, i.e.
?
(i?, j?)
?
A, where i?6= i,j??
Aspan(i).
Otherwise, the alignment is contin-uous.
According to the definition, the alignmentfor ?shaoshu3?
is discontinuous.
Because the tar-get words ?the6?
and ?nations9?
in the alignmen-t span link to another Chinese words ?de9?
and?guojia10?, respectively.
For a target word Ejj, thedefinition is similar.If the alignment for Fiiis discontinuous, wecan split the alignment span Aspan(i) = [j1, j2]into m continuous spans {[jkp, jkq]}, where k =1, 2, ...,m, and jkp, jkq?
[j1, j2].
Our goal is to se-lect the best continuous span for the word Fii.
Todo this, we score each continuous span with wordtranslation probabilities:S([jkp, jkq]) =q?t=p(Pr(Ejkt|Fi) + Pr(Fi|Ejkt))(2)where,Pr(f |e) =count(f, e)?f?count(f?, e)(3)148amongthehandfulofnationsthat??

The heavy shadingarea is selected as the final alignment.Pr(e|f) =count(e, f)?e?count(f, e?
)(4)The word translation probabilities can be comput-ed from the bilingual corpus with the initial wordalignment.
Finally, we select the span with thehighest score as the final alignment, and discardall other alignments.We illustrate our method in Figure 2, whichshows the source word ?shaoshu?
and its align-ment in Figure 1.
We split the alignments intothree continuous alignment spans and compute s-core for each span.
Finally, the span with highestscore (heavy shading area) is selected as the finalalignment.We conduct the procedure for each source andtarget word, the improved alignment (solid links)is shown in Figure 1.3 ExperimentTo demonstrate the effect of the proposed method,we use the state-of-the-art phrase-based systemand hierarchical phrase-based system implement-ed in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).
The phrase-based system uses continuous phrase pair as themain translation knowledge.
While the hierarchi-cal phrase-based system uses both continuous anddiscontinuous phrase pairs, which has an ability tocapture long distance phrase reordering.we carried out experiments on two translationtasks: the Chinese-to-English task comes from theNIST Open MT Evaluation, and the German-to-English task comes from the Workshop on Ma-chine Translation (WMT) shared task.3.1 TrainingThe training data we used are listed in Table 1.
Forthe Chinese-English task, the bilingual data are s-elected from LDC.
We used NIST MT03 as thedevelopment set and tested our system on NISTMT evaluation sets from 2004 to 2008.
For theGerman-English task, the bilingual data are fromTask Src.

We used WMT08as the development set and tested our system onWMT test sets from 2010 to 2013.The baseline systems are trained on the trainingcorpus with initial word alignment, which was ob-tained via GIZA++ and ?grow-diag-final?
method.Based on the initial word alignment, we comput-ed word translation probabilities and used the pro-posed method to obtain a refined word alignment.Then we used the refined word alignment to trainour SMT systems.The translation results are evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002).The feature weights of the translation systemare tuned with the standard minimum-error-rate-training (Och, 2003) to maximize the systemsBLEU score on the development set.3.2 Results3.2.1 Phrase-based SystemTable 2 shows Chinese-to-English translationquality of the phrase-based system.
We ob-served that our refined method significantly out-performed the baseline word alignment on all testsets.
The improvements are ranged from 0.97 to1.68 BLEU%.Table 3 shows German-to-English translationquality of the phrase-based system.
The improve-ments are ranged from 0.51 to 0.75 BLEU%.These results demonstrate that the proposedmethod improves the translation quality for149System N04 N05 N06 N08Baseline 37.33 34.81 32.20 25.33Refined 37.91 35.36 32.75 25.40Combined 38.13 35.63 33.48 25.66Table 4: Chinese-to-English translation quality ofthe hierarchical phrase-based system.System W10 W11 W12 W13Baseline 21.22 19.77 20.53 23.51Refined 21.34 20.64 20.88 23.82Combined 21.65 20.87 21.16 24.04Table 5: German-to-English translation quality ofthe hierarchical phrase-based system.phrase-based system.
The reason is that by dis-carding noisy word alignments from the discon-tinuous alignments, the phrase pairs constrainedby the noisy alignments can be extracted.
Thus thesystem utilized more phrase pairs than the baselinedid.3.2.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based SystemThe hierarchical phrase-based system utilizes dis-continuous phrase pairs for long distance phrasereordering.
Some of the discontinuous phrasepairs are extracted from the discontinuous align-ments.
By transforming the discontinuous align-ments to continuous alignments, on the one hand,we may lost some discontinuous phrase pairs.
Onthe other hand, we may extract additional contin-uous and discontinuous phrase pairs as the align-ment restriction is loose.See Figure 3 for illustration.
From the initialalignment, we can extract a hierarchical phrasepair ?
(dang X1shi, when X1)?
from the discon-tinuous alignment of the English word ?when?.However, the hierarchical phrase pair cannot beextracted from our refined alignment, because ourmethod discards the link between the Chineseword ?dang?
and the English word ?when?.
In-stead, we can extract another hierarchical phrasepair ?
(X1shi, when X1)?.Does our method still obtain improvements onthe hierarchical phrase-based system?
Table 4 andTable 5 shows Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation quality of the hierarchicalphrase-based system, respectively.
For Chinese-to-English translation, the refined alignment ob-tained improvements ranged from 0.07 to 0.58dang?shiguu)fasheng?shiwhen the accidenthappendFigure 3: Example of word alignment between aChinese and English sentence pair.

).While for German-to-English translation, the im-provements ranged from 0.12 to 0.59 BLEU% onthe test set (the row ?Refined?
).We find that the improvements are less thanthat of the phrase-based system.
As discussedabove, our method may lost some hierarchicalphrase pairs that extracted from the discontinuousalignments.
To solve the problem, we combine2the initial alignments and the refined alignmentsto train the SMT system.
The results are shownin the row ?Combined?
in Table 4 and Table 5.For Chinese-to-English translation, we obtainedan improvements of 1.28 BLEU% on NIST06 overthe baseline.
While for German-to-English trans-lation, the greatest improvements is 1.10 BLEU%on WMT11.4 AnalysesIn order to further study the performance of theproposed method, we analyze the word alignmentand the phrase table for Chinese-to-English trans-lation.
We find that our method improves the qual-ity of word alignment.
And as a result, more usefulphrase pairs are extracted from the refined wordalignment.4.1 Word AlignmentThe Chinese-to-English training corpus contains4.5M sentence pairs.
By applying GIZA++ andthe ?grow-diag-final?
method, we obtained initialalignments.
We find that 4.0M (accounting for89%) sentence pairs contain discontinuous align-ments.
We then used the proposed method to dis-card noisy links.
By doing this, the total linksbetween words in the training corpus are reducedfrom 99.6M to 78.9M, indicating that 21% linksare discarded.2We do not perform combination for phrase-based sys-tem, because the phrase table extracted from the initial align-ment is a subset of that extracted from the refined alignment.150Alignment Precision Recall AERInitial 62.94 89.55 26.07Refined 73.43 87.82 20.01Table 6: Precision, Recall and AER on Chinese-to-English alignment.Alignment StandPhr HierPhrInitial 29M 86MRefined 104M 436MTable 7: The phrase number extracted from theinitial and refined alignment for the hierarchicalphrase-based system on Chinese-to-English trans-lation.
StandPhr is standard phrase, HierPhr is hi-erarchical phrase.We evaluated the alignment quality on 200 sen-tence pairs.
Results are shown in Table 6.
It isobserved that our method improves the precisionand decreases the AER, while keeping a high re-call.
This means that our method effectively dis-cards noisy links in the initial word alignments.4.2 Phrase TableAccording to the standard definition of phrase inSMT, phrase pairs cannot be extracted from thediscontinuous alignments.
By transforming dis-continuous alignments into continuous alignmen-t, we can extract more phrase pairs.
Table 7shows the number of standard phrases and hier-archical phrases extracted from the initial and re-fined word alignments.
We find that the number ofboth phrases and hierarchical phrases grows heav-ily.
This is because that the word alignment con-straint for phrase extraction is loosed by removingnoisy links.
Although the phrase table becomeslarger, fortunately, there are some methods (John-son et al., 2007; He et al., 2009) to prune phrasetable without hurting translation quality.For further illustration, we compare the phrasepairs extracted from the initial alignment and re-fined alignment in Figure 1.
From the initial align-ments, we extracted only 3 standard phrase pairsand no hierarchical phrase pairs (Table 8).
Afterdiscarding noisy alignments (dashed links) by us-ing the proposed method, we extracted 21 standardphrase pairs and 36 hierarchical phrases.

The method re-fines initial word alignments by transforming dis-continuous alignment to continuous alignment.
Asa result, more useful phrase pairs are extractedfrom the refined word alignment.
Our method issimple and efficient, since it uses only the wordtranslation probabilities obtained from the initialalignments to discard noisy links.
Our methodis independent of languages and can be appliedto most SMT models.
Experimental results showsignificantly improvements for the state-of-the-artphrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based sys-tems on all Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation tasks.In the future, we will refine the method by con-sidering neighbor words and alignments when dis-carding noisy links.AcknowlegementThis paper is supported by the 973 program No.2014CB340505.
