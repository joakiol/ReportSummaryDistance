The concept of oon Junot iona l  compat ib i l i ty  de-pends on semant i~ psxa l le l iam between the con jo ined  e lements!thus, in the first example, hands and feet are more semantic-ally parallel than swellln~ and feet.
Although it is possibleto write special rules to define allowable con~oln~ngs for apartlaular domain of application, this would mean that the- 129  -system would not be por tab le :  the con junct ion  const ra in tswould have to be rewr i t ten  fo r  each new domain.

This  paper w i l ldescr ibe  such a pr inc ip le ,  implemented as "con junct ion  re -s t r i c t ions"  w i th in  the genera l  t reatment  of  con junct ion  inthe natura l  language process ing  system of  the  L ingu is t i cS t r ing  P ro jec t  parser .
The i l l us t ra t ive  examples are  drawnfrom actua l  text  occur rences  in  hosp i ta l  d i scharge  sunnnaries,processed us ing the mechanisms descr ibed  below, as we l l  asfrom some bu i ld ing  code spec i f i ca t ions ,  a l so  processed wi ththe LSP system.The f i r s t  ru le  of  con Junct iona l  compat ib i l i ty  i s  s imply:Two con jo ined nouns must be long to the  same (domain-specific) semantic class,This rule will produce the correct parse for the two previousexamples, swellin~ of hands and feet and swe l l i~  of handsand fever.
Hands and fee_._~t are both BODY-PART words in thefirst example, while swellin~ is not; in the second example,swellin~ and feve.._...rr are both SIGN.SYMPTOM words.In  o rder  to  determine con Junct iona l  compat ib i l i ty ,  thenoun con juncts  are  compared pa i rw ise!

(Most words belong to  Jus t  one semant ic  c lass !
however, cer -ta in  lex ica l ly  ambiguous wo~ds belong to two or  more c lasses ,as i l l us t ra ted  be low.)

This serves  as a record  of a~v d isambignat ion  thatoccurs  as a resu l t  of  computing oon Junct ions l  compat ib i l i ty .For  example, d i scharge  i s  lex ica l l y  ambiguous in  medicalnar ra t ive :  i t  be longs  to the ~DICAL-ACT c lass ,  as in :- 130  -hospital e~m'Leslen end d lso~geINITIAL LISTS (INST) (MEDICALvACT) (MEDICALvACT,SIGN-s~su~oM)AFTER CONJ.

If we could disregard the word portionsof and look instead at the noun in the prepositional phrase,namely buildin~ with class BLDG, then the conjunction rulewould apply correctly.
We call this type of construction the"computed attribute" oonstructlon, because, in its most gene-ral form, the semant ic  c lass  fo r  an ent i re  phrase i s  computedfrom the  in teract ion  of  the semant ic  c lass  of  the head nounand the o lass (es )  of  i t s  mod i f ie rs .The computed a t t r ibute  const ruc t ion  tu rns  out  to  becharacter i s t i c  of a se t  of  Eng l i sh  semantic c lasses  common toma~7 domains.
These c lasses  inc lude  the c lasses  AMOUNT,PERIOD, BEGINNING, ENDING, FREQUENCY, e tc .
To handle these- 131-const ruct ions ,  an add i t iona l  mechanism has been added as ares t r i c t ion  to the  grammar.

I t  ass igns  to  the  phrase  as  a wholethe  c lass  o f  the  mod i f ie r  and b inds  the  mod i f ie r  to  the  headnoun,  so that  the  mod i f ie r  does  not  d i s t r ibute  over  the  o thercon~oined  noun(s )?
