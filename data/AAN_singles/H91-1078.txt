A SNAPSHOT OF  TWO DARPA SPEECHAND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMSCharles L. WayneDARPA/ISTODARPA is investing in speech and naturallanguage processing research to ensure theavailability of key technology needed by theDepartment of Defense for a wide variety ofapplications.
The research programs aim (a) todevelop enabling component technology that canbe integrated on demand and/or apidly tailored forspecific applications and (b) to demonstrate thattechnology in limited prototypes.
The programsare highly synergistic and emphasize objectiveperformance evaluation.This note describes the overall programs; thefollowing project summaries provide additionaldetail.SPOKEN LANGUAGEThe DARPA Spoken Language program has twomajor components: large vocabulary speechrecognition, which has many applications, andspoken language understanding, aimed atinteractive problem solving.
Both deal withspontaneous, goal-directed, natural anguagespeech.
And both aim for real-time, speaker-independent or speaker-adaptive op ration.
Theprogram also includes basic research to fuel thenext generation ofadvances.Performance evaluation for speech recognition iscurrently being conducted using the ResourceManagement (RM) corpus, which consists ofread queries and commands, and the Air TravelInformation System (ATIS) corpus, whichconsists of spontaneous queries and commands.Plans are underway to expand the ATIS corpusand to replace the RM corpus with a morechallenging one.Performance evaluation for speech understandingis being conducted with the ATIS corpus,collected from subjects interacting with asimulated (wizard-based) understanding systemthat contains certain data from the OfficialAirline Guide (OAG).In addition, several groups are also developingspoken language technology demonstrationapplications.
The most advanced of these isMIT's Voyager system, which providesnavigational assistance for Cambridge,Massachusetts.Groups currently being funded include BBN,Brown, BU, CMU, Dragon, Lincoln, MIT, SRI,TI, and UNISYS.
The program is greatlyenriched by the voluntary participation of AT&Tin the periodic performance evaluations.WRITTEN LANGUAGEThe Written Language program is developing thetechnology needed for large-scale t xt processing.The program encompasses messageunderstanding, natural language learning, basicresearch, and corpus building.
It will sooninclude work on machine translation.Performance evaluation of message understandingsystems is done in terms of database templatefilling.
Multisite evaluations take place inmessage understanding conferences (MUCs).MUC-2, which was held in 1989 used NavyOPREP messages.
MUC-3, which is happeningin two phases this year, is using FBIS newsreports.
Performance valuation of naturallanguage l arning techniques also takes place (inpart) in the context of the MUC process.Performance evaluation of machine translationalgorithms will also be done on previouslyunseen, naturally occurring texts.
DARPA's MTwork is just beginning this year, and animportant part of the initial phase will be todevelop specific evaluation methodologies.Groups currently being funded include BBN,Columbia, NMSU, NYU, Penn, Rochester, SRI,and UCB.
The program is greatly enriched bythe participation of many other groups in theDARPA speech and natural language workshopsand in the MUC process.403~osliI o o II o o op I !
