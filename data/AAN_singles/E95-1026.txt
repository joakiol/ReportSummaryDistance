deAbstractWe present he dialogue component ofthe speech-to-speech translation systemVERBMOBIL.
In contrast to conventionaldialogue systems it mediates the dia-logue while processing maximally 50% ofthe dialogue in depth.
Special require-ments (robustness and efficiency) leadto a 3-layered hybrid architecture forthe dialogue module, using statistics, anautomaton and a planner.
A dialoguememory is constructed incrementally.1 Introduct ionVERBMOBIL combines the two key technologiesspeech processing and machine translation.
Thelong-term goal of this project is the developmentof a prototype for the translation of spoken di-alogues between two persons who want to find adate for a business meeting (for more detail on theobjectives of VERBMOBIL see (Wahlster, 1993)).
Aspecial characteristic of VERBMOBIL is that bothparticipants are assumed to have at least a pas-sive knowledge of English which is used as inter-mediate language.
Translations are produced ondemand so that only parts of the dialogue are pro-cessed.
If VERBMOBIL is inactive, shallow process-ing by a keyword spotter takes place which allowsthe system to follow the dialogue at least partially.In this paper focus is on the description of thedialogue component, which processes the interac-tion of the two dialogue partners and builds a rep-resentation of the discourse.
Dialogue processingin VERBMOBIL differs from systems,like SUNDIAL(Andry, 1992) in two important points: (1) VERB-MOBIL mediates the dialogue between two humandialogue participants; the system is not a partic-ipant of its own, i.e.
it does not control the di-alogue as it happens in the flight scheduling sce-nario of SUNDIAL; (2) VERBMOBIL processes maxi-mally 50% of the dialogue contributions in depth,*The research within VERBMOBIL presented here isfunded by the German Ministry of Research and Tech-nology under grant 011V101K/1.i.e.
when the 'owner' of VERBMOBIL speaks Ger-man only.
The rest of the dialogue can only befollowed by a keyword spotter.In the remainder of this paper first the require-ments of the VERBMOBIL setting with respect ofunctionality and design of the dialogue compo-nent section are introduced.
Then a hybrid archi-tecture for the dialogue component and its embed-ding into the VERBMOBIL prototype are discussed.Finally, results from our implemented system arepresented.
We conclude with an outline of futureextensions.2 Tasks of the DialogueComponentThe dialogue component within VERBMOBIL hasfour mQor tasks:(1) to support speech recognition and linguis-tic analysis when processing the speech signal.Top-down predictions can be made to restrict hesearch space of other analysis components o getbetter esults in shorter time (Young et al, 1989;Andry, 1992)).
For instance, predictions about aspeech act can be used to narrow down the set ofwords which are likely to occur in the followingutterance - a fact exploited by the speech recog-nition component which uses adaptive languagemodels (Jellinek, 1990).
Top-down predictions arealso used to limit the set of applicable grammarrules to a specific subgrammar.
They are of par-ticular importance since the system has to workunder real-time constraints.
(2) to provide contextual information for otherVERBMOBIL components.
In order to get goodtranslations, context plays an important role.
Oneexample is the translation of the German "Geht esbei Ihnen?"
which can be translated as "Does itsuit you?"
or "How about your place?
", depend-ing on whether the dialogue partners discussed atime or a place before.
A discourse history is con-structed which can be accessed by other VP.RB-MOBIL components(Ripplinger and Caroli, 1994;LuperFoy and Rich, 1992).
(3) to follow the dialogue when V~.RBMOBIL isoff-line.
When both dialogue participants speak188English (and no automatic translation is neces-sary) VERBMOBIL is "passive", i.e.
no syntactic orsemantic analyses are performed.
In such cases,the dialogue component tries to follow the dia-logue by using a keyword spotter.
This devicescans the input for a small set of predeterminedwords which are characteristic for certain stages ofthe dialogue.
The dialogue component computesthe most probable speech act type of the next ut-terance in order to selects its typical key words.
(4) to control clarification dialogues betweenVERBMOBIL and its users.
If processing breaksdown VERBMOBIL has to initiate a clarification di-alogue in order to recover.3 The ArchitecturePlannerIFSM'1StatisticsDialogue Memory Intel~~Refer~mtlal StnJcture. Key-Word Spotting I?

i~ Generation IFigure 1: Architecture of the dialogue moduleThe abovementioned requirements cannot bemet when using a single method of processing: ifwe use structural knowledge sources like plans ordialogue-grammars, top-down predictions are dif-ficult make, because usually one can infer manypossible follow-up speech acts from such knowl-edge sources that are not scored (Nagata nd Mo-rimoto, 1993).
Also, a planning-only approach isinappropriate when the dialogue is processed onlypartially.
Therefore we chose a hybrid 3-layeredapproach (see fig.
1) where the layers differ withrespect o the type of knowledge they use and thetask they are responsible for.
The components areA Statist ic Module The task of the statisticmodule is the prediction of the followingspeech act, using knowledge about speech actfrequencies in our training corpus.A Finite State Machine (FSM) Thefinite state machine describes the sequence ofspeech acts that are admissible in a standardappointment scheduling dialogue and checksthe ongoing dialogue whether it follows theseexpectations ( ee fig.
2).A P lanner  The hierarchical planner constructsa description of the dialogue's underlying dia-logue and thematic structures, making exten-sive use of contextual knowledge.
This mod-ule is sensitive to inconsistencies and there-fore robustness and backup-strategies arethemost important features of this component.While the statistical component completely re-lies on numerical information and is able to pro-vide scored predictions in a fast and efficient way,the planner handles time-intensive tasks exploit-ing various knowledge sources, in particular lin-guistic information.
The FSM can be located inbetween these two components: it works like anefficient parser for the detection of inconsistent di-alogue states.
The three modules interact in casesof repair, e.g.
when the planner needs statisticalinformation to resume an incongruent dialogue.On the input side the dialogue component is in-terfaced with the output from the semantic con-struction/evaluation module, which is a Drts-likefeature-value structure (Bos et al, 1994) contain-ing syntactic, semantic, and occasionally prag-matic information.
The input also includes infor-mation from the generation component about theutterance produced in the target language and aword lattice from the keyword spotter.The output of the dialogue module is de-livered to any module that needs informationabout the-dialogue pursued so far, as for examplethe transfer module and the semantic onstruc-tion/evaluation module.
Additionally, the key-word spotter is provided with words expected inthe next utterance.4 Layered Dialogue Processing4.1 Knowledge-Based Layers4.1.1 The Underly ing Knowledge Source- The Dialogue ModelLike previous approaches for modeling task-oriented dialogues we base our ideas on the as-sumption that a dialogue can be described bymeans of a limited but open set of speech acts(e.g.
(Bilange, 1991), (Mast, 1993)).
As pointof departure we take speech acts as proposed by(Austin, 1962) and (Searle, 1969) and also a num-ber of so-called illocutionary acts as employed in amodel of information-seeking dialogues (Sitter andStein, 1992).
We examined the VERBMOBIL cor-pus of appointment, scheduling dialogues for theiroccurrence and for the necessity to introduce newspeech acts 1 .At present,, our model contains 17 speech acts(see (Maier, 1994) for more details on the char-acterization of the various speech acts; the di-alogue model describing admissible sequences ofz The acts we introduce below are mostly of illocu-tionary nature.
Nevertheless we will refer to them asspeech acts throughout this paper.189speech acts is given in fig.
2).
Among the domain-dependent speech acts there are low-level (primi-tive) speech acts like BEC~RUESSUNG for initiatingand VERABSCHIEDUNG for concluding a dialogue.Among the domain-independent speech acts weuse acts as e.g.
AKZEPTANZ and ABLEHNUNG.Additionally, we introduced two speech acts nec-essary for modeling our appointment schedulingdialogues: INIT_TERMINABSPRACHE and BESTAE-TIGUNG.
While the first is used to describe utter-ances which state date s or places to be negotiated,the latter corresponds to contributions that con-tain a mutual agreement concerning a given topic.Mnin dialogueBegruessung Auflordecung_StellungBecufL_Position Init _Telminal~prache Vorsehlag~Vorsldlungrund .TA ~ VomchlagAufforderung_Stellung ~?

ReasonFigure 2: A dialogue model for the description ofappointment scheduling dialoguesThe dialogue consists Of three phases (Maier,1994).
First, an introductory phase, where thediscourse participants greet I each other, introducethemselves and provide information e.g.
abouttheir professional status.
After ?this, the topic ofthe conversation is introduced, usually the factthat one or more appointments have to be sched-uled.
Then negotiation ?begins where the discourseparticipants repeatedly offer possible time frames,make counter offers, refine the time frames, re-ject offers and request other ?
possibilities.
Oncean item is accepted ~nd mutual agreement existseither the dialogue can be terminated, or anotherappointment is negotiated.A dialogue model based on speech acts seemsto be an appropriate approach also from the pointof view of machine translation and of transfer inparticular: While in written discourse sentencescan be considered the basic units of transfer, thisassumption is not valid for spoken dialogues.
Inmany cases only sentence fragments are uttered,which often are grammatically incomplete or evenincorrect.
Therefore different descriptive unitshave to be chosen.
In the case Of VERBMOBIL theseunits are speech acts.The speech acts which in our approach are em-bedded in a sequential model of interaction can beadditionally classified using the taxonomy of dia-logue control functions as proposed in e.g.
(Bunt,1989).
Speech acts like BEGRUESSUNG and VE-RABSCHIEDUNG, for example, can be classified asdialogue flmctions controlling interaction manage-ment.
More fine-grained taxonomical distinctionslike CONFIRM and CONFIRM/WEAK as proposedin (Bunt, 1994) are captured in our approach bypragmatic features like suitability and possibilityspecified in the DRS-description of an utterance,which serves as input for the dialogue component.4.1.2 Ti le F in i te  S tate  Mach ineThe finite state machine provides an efficientand robust implementation f the dialogue model.It parses the speech acts encountered so far, teststheir consistency with the dialogue model andsaves the current state.
When an inconsistencyoccurs fall back strategies (using for instance thestatistical layer) are used to select the most prob-able state.
The state machine is extended to al-low for phenomena that might appear anywherein a dialogue, e.g.
human-human clarification di-alogues and deliberation.
It can also handle re-cursively embedded clarification dialogues.An important ask of this layer is to signal tothe planner when an inconsistency has occurred,i.e.
when a speech act is not within the standardmodel so that it can activate repair techniques.4.1.3 The  Dia logue P lannerTo incorporate constraints in dialogue process-ing and to allow decisions to trigger follow-upactions a plan-based approach has been chosen.This approach is adopted from text generationwhere plan-operators are responsible for choos-ing linguistic means in order to create coherentstretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore andParis, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)).
The applicationof plan operators depends on the validity of con-straints.
Planning proceeds in a top-down fash-ion, i.e.
high-level goals are decomposed into sub-goals, each of which has to be achieved individ-ually in order to be fulfilled.
Our top-level goalSCHEDULE-MEETING (see below) is decomposedinto three subgoals each of which is responsiblefor the treatment of one dialogue segment: the in-190troductory phase (GREET-INTRODUCE-TOPIC), thenegotiation phase (NEGOTIATE) and the closingphase (FINISH).
These goals have to be fulfilled inthe specified order.
The keyword i te ra te  speci-fies that negotiation phases can occur repeatedly.begin-plan-operator GENERIC-OPERATORgoal \[SCHEDULE-MEETING\]constraints nilactions nilsubgoals (sequence \[GREET-INTRODUCE-TOPIC\]iterate \[NEGOTIATE\]\[FINISH\] )end-plan-operatorbegin-plan-operator OFFER-OPERATORgoal \[OFFER\]constra ints  n i lact ions (retr ieve-theme)subgoals pr imit iveend-plan-operatorIn our hierarchy of plan operators the leaves, i.e.the most specific operators, correspond to the in-dividual speech acts of the model as given in fig.
2.Their application is mainly controlled by prag-matic and contextual constraints.
Among theseconstraints are, for example, features related tothe discourse participants (acquaintance, l vel ofexpertise) and features related to the dialogue his-tory (e.g.
the occurrence of a certain speech act inthe preceding context).Additionally, our plan operators contain an ac-tions slot, where operations which are triggeredafter a successful fulfillment of the subgoals arespecified.
Actions, therefore, are employed to in-teract with other system components.
In the sub-plan 0FFER-0PERATOR, for example, which is re-sponsible for planning a speech act of the typeVORSCHLAG, the action (retr ieve-theme) filtersthe information relevant for the progress of thenegotiation (e.g.
information related to dates, likemonths, weeks, days) and updates the thematicstructure of the dialogue history.
During the plan-ning process tree-like structures are built whichmirror the structure of the dialogue.The dialogue memory consists of three layersof dialog structure: (1) an intentional structurerepresenting dialogue phases and speech acts asoccurring in the dialogue, (2) a thematic struc-ture representing the dates being negotiated, and(3) a referential structure keeping track oflexicalrealizations.
The planner also augments he inputsign by pragmatic nformation, i.e.
by informationconcerning its speech act.The plan-based and the other two layers -statistics and finite state machine - interact ina number of ways" in cases where gaps occurin the dialogue statistical rating can help to de-termine the speech acts which are most likely tomiss.
Also, when the finite state machine detect?an error, the planner must activate plan operatorswhich are specialized for recovering the dialoguestate in order not to fail.
For this purpose spe-cialized repair-operators have been implementedwhich determine both the type of error occurredand the most likely and plausible way to continuethe dialogue.
It is an intrinsic feature of the dia-logue planner that it is able to process any input- even dialogues which do not the least coincidewith our expectations of a valid dialogue - andthat it proceeds properly if the parts processed byVERBMOBIL contain gaps.4.2  The Statist ical Layer -  Statist icalModel ing and Predict ionAnother level of processing is an implementa-tion of an information-theoretic model.
In speechrecognition language models are commonly usedto reduce the search space when determining aword that can match a given part of the in?put.
This approach is also used in the domainof discourse modeling to support he recognitionprocess in speech-processing systems (Niedermair,1992; Nagata and Morimoto, 1993).
The units tobe processed are not words, but the speech acts ofa text or a dialogue.
The basis oLprocessing is atraining corpus annotated with the speech acts ofthe utterances.
This corpus is used to gain sta-tistical information about the dialogue structure,namely unigram, bigram and trigram frequenciesof speech acts.
They can be used for e.g.
the pre-diction of following speech acts to support thespeech processing components (e.g.
dialogue de-pendent language models), for the disambiguationof diflhrent readings of a sentence, or for guidingthe dialogue planner.
Since the statistical modelalways delivers a result and since it can adapt it-self to unknown structures, it is very robust.
Also,if the statistic is updated uring normal operation,it can adapt itself to the dialogue patterns of theVERBMOBIL user, leading to a higher predictionaccuracy.Considering a dialogue to be a source that hasspeech acts as output, we can predict the nthspeech act s,~ using the maximal conditional prob-abilitys,, := max.. P(sls,,,1, s,,-2, s,_a, ...)We approximate P with the standard smooth-ing technique known as deleted interpolation(Jellinek, 1990), using unigram, bigram and tri-gram relative frequencies, where f are relative fre-quencies and qi are weights whose sum is 1:P(s , , I s .
- , ,  s,,..~) =q,f(s..) + q~f(s..Is.._, ) + q.~f(s..ls,-,, s..-2)Given tl/is formula and the required N-grams wecan determine the k best predictions for the nextspeech acts.In order to evaluate the statistical model, wemade various experiments.
In the table below theresults for two experiments are shown.
Experi-ment TS1 uses 52 hand-annotated dialogues with1912340 speech acts as training corpus, and 41 dia-logues with 2472 speech acts as test data.
TS2uses another 81 dialogues with 2995 speech actsas test data.I P~ed" I TSI I TS2 I1 40,65 % 44,24 %2 60,19 % 66,47 %3 73,92 % 81,46 %Compared to the data from (Nagata and Mo-rimoto, 1993) who report prediction accuracies of61.7 %, 77.5 % and 85.1% for one, two or threepredictions respectively, our predictions are lessreliable.
The main reason is, that the dialogues inour corpus frequently do not follow conventionaldialogue behavior, i.e.
the dialogue structure dif-fers remarkably from dialogue to dialogue.5 An Annotated ExampleTo get an impression of the flmctionality of thedialogue module, we will show the processing ofthree sentences which are part of an example di-alogue which has a total length of 25 turns.
Thisdialogue is part of a corpus of 200 dialogues whichare all fully processed by our dialogue component.Prior to sentence DEO04 given below ~.L initializedthe dialogue requesting a date for a trip s.DEO04: #oh ja, gut, nach meinem Termin-kalender <Pause>, wie w"ars imOktober?# (VORSCHLAG)VMO05: just lookin at my diary, I wouldsuggest October.
(VORSCHLAG)DEO06/I: <Pause> I propose from Tuesdaythe fifth/-DEO06/2: <Pause> no, Tuesday the fourth toSaturday the eighth <Pause>,those five days?
(VORSCHLAG)ELO07: oh, that's too bad, I'm not freeright then.
(ABLEHNUlVG) <Pause>I could fit it into my schedule<Smack> the week after, fromSaturday to Thursday, thethirteenth.
(VORSCHLAG)If we trace the processing with the finite statemachine and the statistics component, allowingtwo predictions, we get the following results:ELO03 : INIT_TERMINABSPRACHEPrediction: (VORSCHLAG AUFFORDERUNG_VORSCHLAG)DEO04 : VORSCHLAGPrediction: (KKZEPTANZ VORSCHLAG)DEO06/I : VORSCHLAGPrediction: (AKZEPTANZ VORSCHLAG)DEO06/2: VORSCHLAGPrediction: (AKZEPTANZ VORSCHLAG) **Failed**ELO07/I : ABLEHNUNGPrediction: (VORSCHLAG AUFFORDERUNG_STELLUNG)ELO07/2 : VGRSCHLAG2DE indicates the German speaker, VM the trans-lation provided by VERBMOBIL and EL the Englishspeaker.
# indicates pressing or release of the buttonthat activates VERBMOBIL.Prediction: (AKZEPTANZ ABLEHNUNG)While the finite state machine accepts the se-quence of speech acts without failure the pre-dictions made by the statistical module are notcorrect for DE006/2.
The four best predic-tions and their scores are AKZEPTANZ (28.09~,),VORSCHLAG (26.93~,), ABLEHNUNG (21.67~,) andAUFFORDERUNG_STELLUNG (9.7~,).
In comparisonwith the fourth prediction, the first three pre-dictions have a very similar ranking, so that thefailure can only be considered a near miss.
Theoverall prediction rates for the whole dialogue are56.52 %, 82,60%, and 95.65% for one, two, andthree predictions, respectively.Since the dialogue can be processed properlyby the finite state machine no repair is neces-sary.
The only task of the planner therefore isthe construction of the dialogue memory.
It addsthe incoming speech acts to the intentional struc-ture, keeps track of the dates being negotiated,stores the various linguistic realizations of objects(e.g.
lexical variations, referring expressions) andbuilds and administrates the links to the instanti-ated representation f these objects in the knowl-edge representation language BACK (Hoppe et al,1993).
In fig.
3 we give two snapshots howinghow the dialogue memory looks like after process-ing the turns DE006/2 and EL007.6 Conclusion and future extensionsDialogue processing in VERBMOBIL poses prob-lems that differ from other systems like (Mast,1993) and (Bilange, 1991).
Not being in a control-ling position within a speech-processing systembut tracking a mediated ialogue calls for an ar-chitecture where different approaches to dialogueprocessing cooperate.
One important goal of ourmodule is to provide top-down information for theother modules of VERBMOBIL, e.g.
to reduce thesearch space of the word recognizer.
This require-ment is solved partially by using a statistics-basedspeech act prediction component.
Also, we repre-sent contextual information that is important forother VERBMOBIL components, as e.g.
transferand generation.
This information is built up bythe planner during dialogue processing.Future extensions of the dialogue component,which has been sucessfidly tested with 200 dia-logues of our corpus concern the treatment ofclar-ification dialogues.
Robust processing will be an-other issue to be tackled: the possibility to processgaps in the dialogue will also be integrated.ReferencesAndry, F. 1992.
