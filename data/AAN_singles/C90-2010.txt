Information-based Case GramlnarKeh-jiann CHENInstitute of h2Jbrmation ScietzceAccMemia SinicaTaipei, TaiwwzR.O.CClm-Ren HUANGb~stitute ofItistory and PhilologyAcademia SinicaTaipei, TaiwwtR.O.C.KCHEN%IS @TWNCTUO1.BITNET HSCHUREN@TWNAS886.BITNETAbstract: In this paper we propose a framework of Information-based Case Grammar (ICG).
This grammatical formalism entailsthat the lexical entry for each word contain both semantic andsyntactic feature structures.
In the feature structure of a phrasalhead, we encode syntactic and semantic constraints ongrammatical phrasal patterns in terms of thematic structures, andencode the precedence relations in terms of adjunct structures.Such feature structures denote partial information which definesthe set of legal phrases.
They also provide sufficient informationto identify thematic roles.
With this formalism, parsing andthematic analysis can be achieved simultaneously.
Due to thesimplicity and flexibility of Information-based Case Grammar,context dependent and discontinuous relations such asagreements, coordinations, long-distance dependencies, andcontrol and binding, can be easily expressed.
ICG is a kind ofunification-based formalism.
'H:erefore it inherits the advantagesof unification-bmscd formalisms and more.In the feature structure of a phrasal head, we encode syntacticand semantic constraints on grammatical phrasal patterns haterms of thematic structures, and encode the precedence r lationsin terms of adjunct structures.
The feature structure of apotential phr~al head denotes partial information for defining theset of legal/grammatical phrases.
It also provides enoughinformation to identify the thematic roles for arguments andadjuncts \[Chert 89\].
In other words, with ICG, parsing andthematic analysis are achieved simultaneously without additionaloperation; and generation with thematic structure can be donewith the identical formalism.We take Mandarin Chinese as our representational target.Thus, the features were selected to account for Chinese only.Itowever, the abstract design of this formalism is not limited toonly the representation f Chinese.
Since the Chinese lexicon isimpoverished in inflection, it is necessary to fully stipulate bothsemantic and syntactic information for the purpose of bothparsing and generation.
Furthermore the precedence r lationshipof constituents i defined over thematic roles.
This seems to bemore appropriate for Chinese.
By coincidence, Bresnen andKanerva's \[Bresnan 89\] lexical mapping theory represents a shifttowards the possibility of senmntics major approaches.l.
lntroductiozzIn this paper, we plopose a lexicon-based gramrrmticalformalism called hfformatiou-based Case Grammar (ICG).
Thisforma\[isnl entails that the lexical entry ff~r each word containboth sen:antic and syntactic information.
It wiI1 bc argtmd that ourlexicon-based representation approach better focuses informationfor parsit:g a::d generatiotL hi colltrast, the phrase-structure ruleapproaches lack ,ule focusing capability.
Even with the LRparsing strategy \[Tomita 8@ ulmecessary branchiltg andbacktracking cannot be avoided when adopting these approaches.Therefore, modern linguistic theories share the tendency to belexicon-based and to reduce I'S rules.
For instance, LFG andftPSG stipulate the argumetU structure as one of the attributesfor each verb \[Bresnan 82, Pollard 87\] and Karttunen \[Karttunen86\] proposes a radical exicatism's approach to do without PS rulesby representing syntactic itfformation in terms of categorialgrail\]mar.
Categorial granunar, however, offers nostraightfop.vard and intuitive mechanisms to handle contextdependent or discontinuous relations uch as control and longdistance dependency \[Uszkoreit 86\].
llence, we adopt analterlaative approach equivalent to the ID/LP (immediatedominance and linear prcccdcace) format of GPSG \[Gazdar 87\].2.
Feature Structures for Mandarin ChineseChinese is a weakly marked language with no inflection.Nevertheless, the linear order of arguments and adjuncts arerelatively free.
Hence syntactic-only representations would causetremendous ambiguities.
For representational precision and forparsing adequacy, semantic information is indispensibte.
The mostimportant semantic information includes 1. argument structuresand their semantic restrictions, and 2. the semantic features foreach word which ;ire necessary to identify thematic roles, l tcncethe following feature structure (1) was selected so that eachtexical entry can be uniformly represented by the same structurewith lexicalty or syntactically defined value (including null).

The value for each thematicargument is a feature structure of the sametype ~u~ the value for tile feature path'semantic'.E.g.
'a nice boy' is an agent, as in 'A niceboy drove the cattle.

C~me restrictionsindicate semantic preferences of thenmtic roles andfunction as a guide to identifying each case role\[Chen 89\].
The argument structures fur otherphrasal heads such as prepositions, post-positions;.tnd conjunctions serve similar purposes.Adjuncts: a set of pcrmissible adjuncts of the head word.The value of each adjunct is a feature structureof the same type as arguments.E.g.
'yestm day'(4) time: meaning: 'yesterday'features: + timearguments: none\[ac juncts: noneArguments, adjuncts and head form the right-hand side of an immediate dominance rule.Syntactic Class: atomic values denoting the syntactic classof the word.
"Ilm syntactic class of a word serves twopurposes.
The first is to denote the syntactic type.The second is as an index for inheriting commonsyntactic properties belonging to the mother nodein the syntactic hierarchy,Syntactic Form: a set of syntactic and semanticdefinitions for arguments andadjuncts.
"Ilm syntactic form for each thematic role in factconstrains the syntactic structures and semanticfeatures of this role.
We consider semanticrestriction as part of the syntactic onstraint.
Forinstance, temporal expressions are instantiated byat least five different syntactic ategories which arenouns phrase (NPs), compounds withdeterminatives and measures (DM, such as Swz.ditto Shi-fen three-hours ten-minute, i.e.
'three-ten'), post-position phrases (GPs), prepositionphrases (PPs), br adverbs (ADVs).
They all sharea cornmon semantic feature +time regardless oftheir categories.
Therefore tile temporalcxprcssions can be expressed as time \[{NP, DM,PP, GP, ADV}, +time\].
For complex expressions,we adopt the choice system used by tlalliday in thesystemic grammar \[Winograd 83\].Basic Patterns: aset of linear precedence rules governingarguments and heads.The basic patterns for verbs denote the possiblesententkd patterns, including optional argumentomission.
The familiar syntactic generalizationswith regard to passivizatio% topicalization etc.
canbe captured by lexical rules \[Gazdar 85, Pollard 87,Sells 85\].
Adopting the lexical mapping theory,however, is a theoretical possibility to make basicpatterns obsolete \[Bresnan 89, Huang 89\].2 55Adjunct Precedence: a set of linear precedence andcooccurrence constraints foradjuncts.The following notations were adopted.
* : denotes a phrasal head.< : e.g.
"a < b" denotesa precedesb.< < : e.g.
"a < < b" denotes a immediatelyprecedes 12.> < : e.g.
"a > < b" denotes a and b can not cooccur.
{ }: e.g.
"a < {t2,_c }" denotes a precedes both b and_c but there are no preced-enceconstraints between b and c.(5) A nice boy persuaded John to go ,o school yesterday.r meaning; "persuade"features: mstarguments 'AGENT: "meaning: "boy"feature: + }lumanadjuncts:\[ quantifier:\[meaning: "a"\[ feature: -definite, +singulart property:(meaning: "nice"GOAL : L\[t me:ruing: "John"tfeamre: + \]hllrianTIIEME: meaning: "go to"feature: + Eventarguments:/AGENT: El\[GOAL: meaning: %chool"adjuncts: \[,hne: \[ mcani ng: "yesterday"\[ { features: + timeAlthough Basic Patterns and Adjunct Precedence bothgovern !inear precedence relations, they differ in theirnature.
Basic Patterns encode phrasal heads and theirarguments.
Linear order is but an additional piece ofinformation describing the pattern.
It is conceivable, i.e.
innon-configurational languages, that linear precedencerelations play no role in Basic Patterns.
AdjunctPrecedence Rules, on the other hand, are constraints onlinear precedence relations among possible adjuncts.
Inother words, linear order is central to Adjunct Precedencestatements while the presence of each adjunct is not.
"I2ms, a legal phrase can be viewed as a sequence ofthematic roles arranged in a proper order defined by oneof the basic patterns and satisfying all the constraints ofAdjuncts Precedence when qpplicable.
The division ofBasic Pattents from Adjunct Precedence is similar to theID/LP format with the additional inforrnationdifferentiating adjunts from arguments.
The limhednumbers of thematic cases, syntactic categories, andsemantic features require only a finite number ofnotational symbols \[Gazdar 87\].
"~erefore we claim thatICG fails into the ch,ss of context-free grammars.The semantic features would be unified during parsingwhile the syntactic features are no more than constraintsguiding appropriate unification.
We \[lave a scheme toidentify the thematic roles by' fully utilizing the semanticaf~d syntactic information \[Chen 89\].
In \[Chen 89\], Chenet al propose an information accumulation scheme(incremental description refinement in \[Mellish 88\]) foridentifying thematic roles with the parametricalizedinformation encoded with the ICG formalism.
The fourtypes of parametric infornaatitm used in Chinese are:a. th_2e ~utactic ~ and semantic features ofthe constituent,b.

77ze Formal Definition for hzformation.based CaseGrwnmar: The Lexicon and Principlesrl'be ICG is composed of two major components.
One is thelexicon which is the set of feature structures ms described insection 2.
The other is the principles.
Each feature structure canbe viewed as a set of interpretable r presentations of syntactic andsemantic information governed by a formal synt~.
A parser orgenerator interpretes feature structures while parsing orgenerating sentences.
The interpretation processes are guided bythe principles of the grammar, qhe principles define well-formedness conditions and the rules for infommtion managementfor sentences and phrases.
The parser or generator takes lexicalinformation and unify it in such a way that changes of lexicalinformation woukl not affect the phr,'ksing or generating process.Therefore we claim that ICG is declarative, qlm major principlesof ICG are summarized below:1) I Iead Driven PrincipleThe feature structure of a head contains the partialinformation that defines the permissible set of phraseswith it ,'ks a phrasal head.
The possible head types andrespective phrase types for Mandarin Chinese are asfollows.
(6)I Icad PbrascV S, VI'N NPPrcp ppPost P GI'Determinant DM (determinat ireatld nleasurecouq~mtnd)Conjunction CP (conjunctive phrase)The syntactic classes of the heads determine thesyntactic types of their projections.
VP is definedas an S without subject \[Gazdar 87\].56 32) Well-formedness ConditionsLike LFG \[Bresnan 82\], we have tim followingwell-formedness conditions:a. Completeness and functional biuniquenessconditions,b.
Coherence conditions,and c. Linear precedence and syntactic form constraints.In fact, the completeness condition is enforced withrespect to Basic Patterns (BP) only.
The cases ofargument omission are idiosyncratically determined byverb classes, and are nut governed by the completenesscondition, On the other hand, adjuncts are optional andconstrained orfly by linear precedence rules AP and formrestrictions.
The functional uniqueness condition is alsorelaxed a bit to account fur cases of multiple occurrencesof some adjuncts uch as modal at the sentential level,and rop_Lg.p_~ ~ on the noun phrase level, by annotatingKleene's tar on top of the adjunct modal and the adjunct3) Feature Propagation Principlesa.
Head feature conve,)tion \[Gazdar 85\],b.
Foot feature principle \[Gazdar 85\],e. Explicit feature paths:Explicitly denoting the daughter's feature inthe mother node by a feature path such as the'argument feature',d.
Conditional features:Locally ambiguous semantic features can beexpressed by conditional features.
ForiJrstance, the preposition bei 'by' can markan agent, a causer, or an instrumentdepending upon whether the arguments areanimate, nonphysical, or physical inanimaterespectively.
Therefore the feature structureof bei 'by' would be (7).

qlw.y are differentiated by attribute value pairs.
Tim threerequired types of semantic features for Chinese are 1. semanticclasses e.g.
+ animate 2. syntactic/semantic feature, e.g.
+NEG 3. thematic roles, e.g.
AGENT.
Different types offeatures can be identified simply by their attribute names e.g.
weknow AGENT in <ARGUMENT AGENT> is a thematic role.The head feature principle is thc same as the one in GPSG\[Gazdar 85\] which states that in any local subtree, the headfeatures of the mother are identical to the hcad features of thehead daul, hter.
Similarly, our Foot feature principle also followsGPSG.
Roughly speaking, foot features are passed up fromany daughter in a tree, with the upper and lower limits of thispropagation are determined by prior specification \[Gazdar 85\].In Chinese, +_.
Question, + Negation, + Plural, + Definite etc.are all considered foot features.The semantic lass of a thematic role is usually determined byits head daughter.
However, for the marked cases with thesyntactic categories of PP/GP, the semantic classes aredetermined by complement daughters.
We can not define everysemantic type ,as a foot feature.
Therefore, we propose toexplicitly state the daughter's feature in the mother node by afeature path such as 'DUMMY featm'es' in (7).4.
What Makes ICG a Good Representational LanguageWe think that the simplicity and flexibility of the ICGformalism makes it a good representational language.
It is simplesince ICG is a type of context-free gramnmr and the attributes forfeature structures are nniform for all different ypes of phrases.Preparation of lexical feature structures are straightfonvard.Linguists can start with the categorial feature structure of eachentry by discovering idividual idinsyncracies and then modifyingthe categorial feature structure accordingly.
As for flexibility,ICG is much more flexible than tile other context-freegrammatical forms such as BNF, GPSG, etc., due to the widerscope of accessibility and the richness of informatioh encoding oneach thematic onstituent.
Context dependent and discontinuousrdafions such as agreements, coordinations, long-distancedependencies, control and binding, can be easily expressed inICG.4.1 Agreement altd CoordhmtionAgreement and coordination pose similar problems inrepresentation (but different proNems in processing).
Both haveto express the relations between daughters.
Coordination can heviewed as the agreement of syntactic or/and semantic lassesbetween two daughter arguments of a conjunction.
In contrast,other types of agreements are the relations between headdaughter and complement daughters.
Since ICG provides anexplicit accessing capability to tim daughters features, both typesof agreements can be easily solved.
The only difference is thatcoordination requires a w~riable ranging over a finite domainof syntactic classes and/or semantic classes to denote thecommon features of two arguments (8).
For instance, the subjectverb agreement problems are solved by stating agreementconstraints on each subject role in every basic pattern.
Forexample, the AGENT of the verb "persuades" is expressed as,AGENT \[NP, + singular, + third\] in active voice.

2 Long-distattce DepeiMencyKaplan and Zaenen \[Kaplan 88, Kaplan 89\] proposedfunctional uncertainty as a new descriptive technique, assuminggrammatical function in LFG, in order to account for long-distance dependencies.
The schema of functional uncertaintyavoid the.
problem of infinite specifications so that the attributepositions for topicalizable constituet, us cot, ld be realized as aregular expression such as (T comp subj\[obj)=(T topic).
Thisequation expresses the uncertainty about what the with-in clausefunctional roles of an extraposed topic might be.
It offered aclearer and mr.~re accurate characterization of long-distancedependencies but still could not handle the case of contextdependency in topicalization.
For instance, there are many verbsin Chinese which do not allow the object to be topicalized.
Whensuch a verb is the head of aa embedded sentence, it is clear that(comp obj) is not toplicalizable either.
There is no way to predictthe topicalizable constituent in depth by way of regularexpressions.
There are similar examples in English.
(9)a.b.Who/ did Mary think that Bill saw e i ?
?Who/ did Mary quip that Bill saw e i ?Who/ did John tell you (that) Mary thoughtthat Bill saw e i ?
?Who/ did John tell you (that) Mary quippedthat Bill saw e i ?lIowever we can solve such context dependentproblenrs in ICG by recursively defining the topicalizableconstituents in terms of topicalizable constituents ofembedded sentences.
The verb with sententialcomplements usually causes the problems.
We mayencode the topicalized sentence patterns ms a part of BPor as derived by iexical rules.
The topic of the embeddedsentence is ope of the topicalizable cot~sdtuents of such"?erb.~< For instance the topicalized sentence pattern ofexample (2) is:TOPIC \[TOPIC (THEME)\]< AGENT\[NP\]< ?
<GOAL\[NI'\] <TttEME/TOPICThe topics of embedded sentences are defined rccursivelyunder the sentcnce patterns of the verbs of embeddedsentences.
Detailed discussion is given in \[Chen 90,Huang 90\].4.3 Control and BindingFunctional control is tile relation that exists between anantecedent and the missing subject in an XCOMP orXADJUNCT \[Bresnan 82, Sells 85\].
The coindex label adopted inthe unification-based grammars is a simple solution to suchproblems.
We use the same scheme in ICG, e.g.
in (2).Anaphoric binding was solved in LFG by the concept of F-command \[Bresnau 82, Sells 851 .
The same concept is alsoapplicable to ICG.5, CoHclusiotlFrom the brief sketch above, it is clear that e:xch lexical entrycontains a large amount of redundant syntactic and semanticinformation shared by other entries belonging to the samecategory, llence, a more elegant and economic strategy is toform a category hierarchy and to store shared information onhigher level nodes.
Each lexical entry contains only individualidiosyncracies.
Thus the redundancy in representation can beremoved and data consistency can also be easily maintained.ICG is a kind of unification-based formalism.
Therefore allthe advantages of unification-based formalism were kept in ICG.Furthernmre, additional advaqtages are incorporated via thefollowing design features of ICG.1.
Declarative"II~e lexical information defines legal sentences orphrase.
And the changes in the above information doesnot affect processing procedures and results.2.
Algorithm-freeDifferent control processes are allowed for parsing orgeneration.
Regardless of whether it is sequential,parallel, or heuristic ontrol, the result will be the same.3.
Suitable for parallel processingThe processes are head driven.
Each possible head caninitiate a phrasal construction process.
Thus, processescan be executed in parallel.4.
Allows a partial parseAt any moment of the unification processes, theaccumulated information shows the partial result up tothat momem even if the input is ungrammatical.5.
Semantic structure is universalThe semantic information contained in the featurestructures of each lexical entry is universal.
Differentlanguages differ with regard to syntactic of information.6.
Incorporated with thenmtic role identification schen~eThe parametrical information for identifying thematicroles can bo encoded in ICG such that syntactic parsingand semantic analysis can be done in parallel.7.
Parsing result is a thematic structureRecent theoretical linguistic studies are concerned withthe relationship between thematic structures andargument structures (e.g.
Brensan and Kanerva 1989).Our formalism directly and explicitly represents hematicstructures.Last but not least, we expect future studies of ICG to confirmtile plausibility of the following advantages.1.
Efficient parsingICG has the advantages of lexicon-based parsingwhich is better focused on the relavant syntactic andsemantic information.2.
Cognitive realityThe language capability of a man seems to beimproved day after day by learning and polishinglexical information.
ICG is able to reflect thisphenomenon.58 53.
Germration powerICG provides a way of generating surfaceseIlteilces froili thematic structures.
The pragmaticconsideration of the selection of the sentencepatterns can be accomplished by incorporating thepragmatic features in the basic patterns and lexicalrules.5.
