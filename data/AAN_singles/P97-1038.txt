An Alignment Method for Noisy Parallel Corpora based onImage Processing TechniquesJason S. Chang and Mathis H. ChenDepartment ofComputer Science,National Tsing Hua University, Taiwanjschang@cs.nthu.edu.tw mathis @nlplab.cs.nthu.edu.twPhone: +886-3-5731069 Fax: +886-3-5723694AbstractThis paper presents a new approach to bitextcorrespondence problem (BCP) of noisy bilingualcorpora based on image processing (IP) techniques.By using one of several ways of estimating thelexical translation probability (LTP) between pairsof source and target words, we can turn a bitextinto a discrete gray-level image.
We contend thatthe BCP, when seen in this light, bears a strikingresemblance to the line detection problem in IP.Therefore, BCPs, including sentence and wordalignment, can benefit from a wealth of effective,well established IP techniques, includingconvolution-based filters, texture analysis andHough transform.
This paper describes a newprogram, PlotAlign that produces a word-levelbitext map for noisy or non-literal bitext, based onthese techniques.Keywords: alignment, bilingual corpus,image processing1.
IntroductionAligned corpora have proved very useful in manytasks, including statistical machine translation,bilingual lexicography (Daille, Gaussier and Lange1993), and word sense disambiguation (Gale,Church and Yarowsky 1992; Chen, Ker, Sheng,and Chang 1997).
Several methods have recentlybeen proposed for sentence alignment of theHansards, an English-French corpus of Canadianparliamentary debates (Brown, Lai and Mercer1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster andIsabelle 1992; Chen 1993), and for other languagepairs such as English-German, English-Chinese,and English-Japanese (Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung,Helfman and Satish 1993; Kay and Rtischeisen1993; Wu 1994).The statistical approach to machine translation(SMT) can be understood as a word-by-wordmodel consisting of two sub-models: a languagemodel for generating a source text segment S and atranslation model for mapping S to its translationT.
Brown et al (1993) also recommend using abilingual corpus to train the parameters ofPr(S I 73,translation probability (TP) in the translationmodel.
In the context of SMT, Brown et al(1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I 73for word alignment.
The authors propose usingan adaptive Expectation and Maximization (EM)algorithm to estimate parameters for lexicaltranslation probability (LTP) and distortionprobability (DP), two factors in the TP, from analigned bitext.
The EM algorithm iteratesbetween two phases to estimate LTP and DP untilboth functions converge.Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishingsentence boundaries for a noisy bitext obtainedfrom an OCR device is quite difficult.
Dagan,Church and Gale (1993) recommend aligningwords directly without he preprocessing phase ofsentence alignment.
They propose usingchar_align to produce a rough character-levelalignment first.
The rough alignment provides abasis for estimating the translation probabilitybased on position, as well as limits the range oftarget words being considered for each source word.Char_align (Church 1993) is based on theobservation that there are many instances o f .297?

An example of a dotplot ofalignment showing only likely dots which liewithin a short distance from the diagonal.cognates among the languages in the Indo-European family.
However, Fung and Church(1994) point out that such a constraint does notexist between languages across language groupssuch as Chinese and English.
The authorspropose a K-vec approach which is based on a k-way partition of the bilingual corpus.
Fung andMcKeown (1994) propose using a similar measurebased on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) betweenoccurrence r cency sequences to improve on the K-vec method.The char-align, K-vec and DTW approaches relyon dynamic programming strategy to reach a roughalignment.
As Chen (1993) points out, dynamicprogramming is particularly susceptible todeletions occurring in one of the two languages.Thus, dynamic programming based sentencealignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors(Brown et al 1991) or lexical information, such ascognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a highaccuracy rate.
These methods are not robust withrespect to non-literal translations and largedeletions (Simard 1996).
This paper presents anew approach based on image processing (IP)techniques, which is immune to such predicaments.2.
BCP as image processing2.1 Estimation of LTPA wide variety of ways of LTP estimation havebeen proposed in the literature of computationallinguistics, including Dice coefficient (Kay andR6scheisen 1993), mutual information, ~2 (Galeand Church 1991b), dictionary and thesaurusTable 1.
Linguistic constraints.
Linguistic constraintsat various level of alignment resolution give rise todifferent ypes of image pattern that are susceptibleto well established IP techniques.Constraints Image IP techniques AlignmentPattern ResolutionStructure Edge Convolution PhrasepreservingOne-to-one Texture Feature SentenceextractionNon-crossing Line Hough Discoursetransforminformation (Ker and Chang 1996), cognates(Simard 1992), K-vec (Fung and Church 1994),DTW (Fung and McKeown 1994), etc.Dice coefficient:Dice(s,t)= 2. prob( s, t) prob(s) + prob(t)mutual information:Ml(s, t) = log prob(s,t) prob(s), prob(t)Like the image of a natural scene, the linguistic orstatistical estimate of LTP gives rise to signal aswell as noise.
These signal and noise can beviewed as a gray-level dotplot (Church and Gale1991), as Figure 1 shows.We observe that the BCP, when cast as a gray-levelimage, bears a striking resemblance to IP problems,including edge detection, texture classification, andline detection.
Therefore, the BCP can benefitfrom a wealth of effective, well established IPtechniques, including convolution-based filtering,texture analysis, and Hough transform.2.2 Properties of aligned corporaThe PlotAlign algorithms are based on threelinguistic constraints that can be observed atdifferent level of alignment resolution, includingphrase, sentence, and discourse:2981.
Structure preserving constraint: The connec-tion target of a word tend to be located next tothat of its neighboring words.2.
One-to.one constraint: Each source word tokenconnect to at most one target word token.3 Non-crossing constraint: The connection targetof a sentence does not come before that of itspreceding sentence.HehopestoachieveallhisaimsbytheendoftheyearFigure 2.0Omi[ ]me[]BShort edges and textural pattern in adotplot.
The shaded cells are positionswhere a high LTP value is registered.
Thecell with a dark dot in it is an alignmentconnection.Each of these constraints lead to a specific patternin the dotplot.
The structure preserving constraintmeans that the connections of adjacent words tendto form short, diagonal edges on the dotplot.
Forinstance, Figure 2 shows that the adjacent wordssuch as "He hopes" and "achieve all" lead todiagonal edges, 00  and 00  in the dotplot.However, edges with different orientation may alsoappear due to some morphological constraints.For instance, the token "aim" connects to aMandarin compound "I~ ~.," thereby gives rise tothe horizontal edge 00 .
The one-to-oneassumption leads to a textural pattern that can becategorized as  region of dense dots distributedmuch like the l 's in a permutation matrix.
Forinstance, the vicinity of connection dot O (end,)~,)is denser than that of a non-connection say (end,).
Furthermore, the n arby connections @, O,and 0 ,  form a texture much like a permutationmatrix with roughly one dot per row and percolumn.
The non-crossing assumption means thatthe connection target of a sentence will not comebefore that of its preceding sentence.
For instance,Figure 1 shows that there are clearly two long linesrepresenting a sequence of sentences where thisconstraint holds.
The gap between these two linesresults from the deletion of several sentences in thetranslation process.

Convolution.
(a) LTP dotplot beforeconvolution; and (b) after convolution.2.3 Convolution and local edge detectionConvolution is the method of choice for enhancingand detecting the edges in an image.
For noise orincomplete image, as in the case of LTP dotplot, adiscrete convolution-based filter is effective infilling a missing or under-estimated dot which issurrounded by neighboring dots with high LTPvalue according to the structure preserving con-straint.
A filtering mask stipulates the relativelocation of these supporting dots.
The filteringcan be proceed as follows to obtain Pr(sx, ty), the299translation probability of the position (x, y), fromt(sx+i, ty+j), the LTP values of itself and neighboringcells:Pr(sx, t r) = ~ ~ t(sx+i, ty, j)?mask(i,j)j=  .w i= -wwhere w is a pre-determined parameter specifyingthe size of the convolution filter.
Connections thatfall outside this window are assumed to have noaffect on Pr(sx, ty).For simplicity, two 3x3 filters can be employed todetect and accentuate he signal:-1 -1 -1 2 -1 -12 2 2 -1 2 -1-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 2However, a 5 by 5 filter, empirically derived fromthe data, performs much better.-0.04 -0.11 -0.20 -0.15 -0.110.08 -0.01 -0.25 -0.19 -0.15-0.13 0.27 1.00 0.27 -013-0.13 -0.16 -0.22 0.02 0.11-0.10 -0.14 -0.19 -0.10 -0.022.4 Texture analysisFollowing the common practice in IP for textureanalysis, we propose to extract features todiscriminate a connection region in the dotplot fromnon-connection regions.
First, the dotplot shouldbe normalized and binarized, leaving the expectednumber of dots, in order to reduce complexity andsimplify computation.
Then, projectionaltransformation to either or both axes of thelanguages involved will compress the data furtherwithout losing too much information.
Thatfurther reduces the 2D texture discrimination taskto a 1D problem.
For instance, Figure 4 showsthat the vicinity of a connection (by, ~r)  ischaracterized by evenly distributed high LTPvalues, while that of a non-connection is not.According to the one-to-one constraint, we shouldbe looking for dense and continuous 1D occurrenceof dots.
A cell with high density and high powerdensity indicate that connections fall on the vicinityof the cell.
With this in mind, we proceed asfollows to extract features for textural discrimina-tion:1.
Normalize the LTP value row-wise and column-wise.2.
For a window of n x m cells, set the t (s, t)values of k cells with highest LTP values to 1and the rest to 0, k = max (n, m).3.
Compute the density and deviation features:projection:Itp (x, y) = ~,t(x,y+j)j= -vdensity:d (x,y) =wY~p(x + i, y)i~w2w+ 1power density:pd(x,y)= ~ *~* p(x',y).p(x'-i,y)i=1 x'=x-wwhere w and v are the width and height of a windowfor feature extraction, and c is the bound for theresolution of texture.
The bound depends on thecoverage rate of LTP estimates; 2 or 3 seems toproduce satisfactory results.Since the one-to-one constraint is a sentence levelphenomena, the values for w and v should bechosen to correspond to the lengths of averagesentences in each of the two languages.2.5 Hough transform and line detectionThe purpose of Hough transform (HT) algorithm,in short, is to map all points of a line in the originalspace to a single accumulative value in theparameter space.
We can describe a line on x-yplane in the form p = x.sin0 + y.cos0.
Therefore,300a point (p, 0) on the p - 0 plane describes a line onthe x-y plane.
Furthermore, HT is insensitive toperturbation i the sense the line of (p, 0) is veryclose to that of (p+Ap, 0+A0).
That enablesHT-based line detection algorithm to fred highresolution, one-pixel-wide lines, as well as lower-resolution lines.p 1/2 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1/21/31/21/2He mt I Ihopes Im I Ito W Iachieve ~ I Iall ~]e Jhis ~ ~]aims ~by 0 J Jthe I Iend ?

Projection.
The histogram of horizontalprojection of the data in Figure 2.As mentioned above, many alignment algorithmsrely on anchors, such as cognates, to keepalignment on track.
However, that is onlypossible for bitext of certain language pairs andtext genres.
For a clean bitext, such as theHansards, most dynamic programming basedalgorithms perform well (Simard 1996).
To thecontrary, a noisy bitext with large deletions,inversions and non-literal translations will appearas disconnected segments on the dotplot.
Gapsbetween these segments may overpower dynamicprogramming, and lead to a low precision rate.Simard (1996) shows that for the Hansards corpus,most sentence-align algorithms yield a precisionrate over 90%.
For a noisy corpus, such asliterary bitext, the rate drops below 50%.Contrary to the dynamic programming basedmethods, Hough transform always detect he mostapparent line segments even in a noisy dotplot.Before applying Hough transform, the sameprocesses of normalization and thresholding areperformed first.
The algorithm is described asfollows:1.
Normalize the LTP value row-wise and column-wise.2.
For a window of n x m cells, set the t(s, t) valuesof k cells with highest LTP values to 1 and therest to 0, k = max (n, m).3.
Set incidence (p, 0) = 0, for all - k < p < k, -90 ?<0<0 ?,4.
For each cell (x, y), t(x, y) = 1 and -90 ?
< 0 < 0 ?,increment incidence (x cos 0 + y sin 0, 0) by 1.5.
Keep (p, 0) pairs that have high incidence value,incidence (p, 0) > ~,.
Subsequently, filter outdot (x, y) that does not lie on such a line, (p, 0)or within a certain distance ~i from (p, 0).3.
Exper imentsTo asses the effectiveness of the PlotAlignalgorithms, we conducted a series of experiments.A novel and its translation was chosen as the testdata.
For simplicity, we have selected mutualinformation to estimate LTP.
Statistics of mutualinformation between a source and target words isestimated using an outside source, examplesentences and translation i  the Longman English-Chinese Dictionary of Contemporary English(LecDOCE, Longman Group, 1992).
An addi-tional list of some 3,200 English person names andChinese translations are used to enhance thecoverage of proper nouns in the bitext.301500r j2OO100 /~.

He walked on the oppositeside of the street from her; using a zoom lens, he hadalready shot a whole roll of film.
When they came toSeventy-ninth Street, he caught a real break when shecrossed over to him, and he realised he might be ableto squeeze off full-face shots.
Maybe, i{it clouded overmore, she might take off her dark glasses.
That wouldbe a real coup.4.
Result and DiscussionFigure 6 shows that the coverage and precision ofthe LTP estimate is not very high.
That is to beexpected since the translation is not literal and themutual information estimate based on an outsidesource might not be relevant.
Nevertheless,PlotAlign algorithms eem to be robust enough toproduce reasonably high precision that can be seenfrom Figure 3.
Figure 3(a) shows that anormalization and thresholding process based onone-to-one constraints does a good job of filteringout noise.
Figure 3(b) shows that convolution-based filtering remove more noise according to theassumption of structure preserving constraint.Texture analysis does an even better job in noisesuppression.
Figure 7(a) and 7(b) show thatsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greatly improved.The filtering based on Hough Transform, contraryto the other two filtering methods, prefersconnection that is consistent with other connectionsglobally.
It does a pretty good job of identifying along line segment.
However, isolated, shortsegments, urrounded by deletions are likely to bemissed out.
Figure 8(b) shows that filtering basedon HT missed out the short line segment appearingnear the center of the dotplot shown in Figure 6(b).Nevertheless, this short segment presents mostvividly in the result of textural filter, shown inFigure 7(b).
By combining filters on all threelevels of resolution, we gather as much evidence aspossible for optimal result.302500400300 ~2m;100ol ' I0(a)l, 41 l ?

Conclus ionThe algorithm's performance discussed herein candefinitely be improved by enhancing the variouscomponents of the algorithms, e.g.
introducingbilingual dictionaries and thesauri.
However, thePlotAlign algorithms constitute a functional corefor processing noisy bitext.
While the evaluationis based on an English-Chinese bitext, the linguisticconstraints motivating the algorithms seem to bequite general and, to a large extent, languageindependent.
If that is the case, the algorithms303should be effective to other language pairs.
Theprospects for English-Japanese or Chinese-Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising.Performing the alignment task as image processingproves to be an effective approach and sheds newlight on the bitext correspondence problem.
Weare currently looking at the possibilities ofexploiting powerful and well established IPtechniques to attack other problems in naturallanguage processing.AcknowledgementThis work is supported by National ScienceCouncil, Taiwan under contracts NSC-862-745-E007-009 and NSC-862-213-E007-049.
