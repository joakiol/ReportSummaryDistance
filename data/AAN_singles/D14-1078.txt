Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), page 707,October 25-29, 2014, Doha, Qatar.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsLearning from Rational?BehaviorThorsten JoachimsDepartment of Computer Science andDepartment of Information ScienceCornell Universitytj@cs.cornell.eduAbstractThe ability to learn from user interactionscan give systems access to unprecedentedamounts of knowledge.
This is evidentin search engines, recommender systems,and electronic commerce, and it can bethe key to solving other knowledge in-tensive tasks.
However, extracting theknowledge conveyed by user interactionsis less straightforward than standard ma-chine learning, since it requires learningsystems that explicitly account for humandecision making, human motivation, andhuman abilities.In this talk, I argue that the design space ofsuch interactive learning systems encom-passes not only the machine learning algo-rithm itself, but also the design of the inter-action under an appropriate model of userbehavior.
To this effect, the talk exploreshow integrating microeconomic models ofhuman behavior into the learning processleads to new interaction models and theirassociated learning algorithms, leading tosystems that have provable guarantees andthat perform robustly in practice.About the SpeakerThorsten Joachims is a Professor in the Depart-ment of Computer Science and the Department ofInformation Science at Cornell University.
His re-search interests center on a synthesis of theory andsystem building in machine learning, with appli-cations in information access, language technol-ogy, and recommendation.
His past research fo-cused on support vector machines, text classifi-cation, structured output prediction, convex opti-mization, learning to rank, learning with prefer-ences, and learning from implicit feedback.

Some modeling is required.2001, he finished his dissertation advised by Prof.Katharina Morik at the University of Dortmund.From there he also received his Diploma in Com-puter Science in 1997.
Between 2000 and 2001 heworked as a PostDoc at the GMD Institute for Au-tonomous Intelligent Systems.
From 1994 to 1996he was a visiting scholar with Prof. Tom Mitchellat Carnegie Mellon University.707
