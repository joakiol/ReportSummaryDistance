Our goal is to evaluate the perfor-mance of simple, Regex-based algorithmsthat have the advantage of low compu-tational cost, simple implementation, anddo not rely on the accurate computationof deep linguistic features of idiosyncraticclinical texts.
The performance of theNegEx algorithm with an additional set ofRegex-based rules reveals promising re-sults (evaluated on the BioScope corpus).Current and future work focuses on a boot-strapping algorithm for the discovery ofnew rules from unannotated clinical texts.1 MotivationFinding negated and speculative (hedging) state-ments is an important subtask for biomedical In-formation Extraction (IE) systems.
The task ofhedge detection is of particular importance in thesub-genre of clinical texts which tend to avoid un-qualified negations or assertions.Negation/Speculation discovery is typicallybroken down into two subtasks - discovering thenegation/speculation cue (a phrase or a syntacticpattern) and establishing its scope.
While a num-ber of cue and scope discovery algorithms havebeen developed, high performing systems typi-cally rely on machine learning and more involvedfeature creation.
Deep linguistic feature creationcould pose problems, as the idiosyncrasies of clin-ical texts often confuse off-the-shelf NLP featuregeneration tools (e.g.
relying on proper punctu-ation and grammaticality).
In addition, computa-tionally expensive algorithms could pose problemsfor high-volume IE systems.In contrast, simple Regex-based algorithmshave demonstrated larger practical significance asthey offer reasonable performance at a low devel-opment and computational cost.
NegEx1 (Chap-man et al, 2001), a simple rule-based algorithmdeveloped for the discovery of negation of findingsand diseases in discharge summaries, has been im-plemented in a number of BioNLP systems, in-cluding Metamap2, CaTIES3, and Mayo Clinic?sClinical IE System (Savova et al, 2008).
InNegEx, a list of phrases split into subsets are usedto identify cues and their corresponding scopes(token widows preceding or following the cues).2 MethodNegation/Speculation in general English could beexpressed by almost any combination of mor-phologic, syntactic, semantic, and discourse-levelmeans.
However, the scientific ?dryness?
of thebiomedical genre and clinical texts in particular,limits language variability and simplifies the task.We evaluated the performance of the NegEx al-gorithm on the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al,2008).

Without any tuningor modifications, NegEx performed well on identi-fying negation cues across all documents, achiev-1http://code.google.com/p/negex/2c?The National Library of Medicine3http://caties.cabig.upmc.edu/Wiki.jsp?page=Home81ing an F-score of 90% on the clinical texts.
Forthe task of identifying speculation cues, we sim-ply used the NegEx Conditional Possibility Phraselist (35 speculative cue phrases).
The overall per-formance of this simplistic approach revealed poorresults.TP FP FN Precision Recall F-scoreNegationRad Reports 836 131 36 86.45 95.87 90.92Full Papers 307 74 71 80.58 81.22 80.9Paper Abstracts 1390 211 367 86.82 79.11 82.79SpeculationRad Reports 62 1 1075 98.41 5.45 10.33Full Papers 1 0 681 100.0 0.15 0.3Paper Abstracts 0 5 2694 0.0 0.0 0Table 3: NegEx performance on identifying Negation andSpeculation Cues (non-exact boundary).
(TP=true positive,FP=false positive, FN=false negative)As shown in Figure 1, speculation cues ex-hibit wider variability and a rule matching only35 phrases proved inefficient.
To enrich the list ofspeculation cues, we used hedging cues from theFlySlip corpus of speculative sentences4.
Withoutany synonym expansion or fine-tuning, the per-formance of speculation cue detection improvedsignificantly as shown in Table 4, achieving an F-score of 86% on the clinical dataset5.Figure 1: The number of occurrences (Y axis) of the 228unique speculation cues and the 45 unique negation cues ofthe BioScope corpus (X axis).Corpus TP FP FN Precision Recall F-scoreRad Reports 903 52 234 94.55 79.42 86.33Full Papers 439 553 243 44.25 64.37 52.45Paper Abstracts 1741 1811 953 49.01 64.63 55.75Table 4: NegEx performance on identifying speculationcues (non-exact boundary) with the addition of the FlySliphedging cues.We next measured the performance of NegExon scope detection.
Newly introduced speculationcues from the FlySlip corpus were automaticallyclassified into preceding or following their scopebased the position of of their annotated ?topic?.
Ta-ble 5 shows the results of scope identification.3 DiscussionOur results show that a simple, surface-level algo-rithm could be sufficient for the task of negation4http://www.wiki.cl.cam.ac.uk/rowiki/NaturalLanguage/FlySlip/Flyslip-resources5To avoid fine-tuning cues on the corpus we did not set aside a training subset ofthe BioScope corpus for speculation cue enhancements and instead used an independenthedging corpus (FlySlip).TP FP FN Precision Recall F-scoreNegationRad Reports 4003 267 140 94.12 97.61 95.18Full Papers 2129 1835 525 54.45 80.12 64.01Paper Abstracts 10049 6023 1728 63.04 85.13 72.31SpeculationRad Reports 2817 1459 2471 65.87 53.27 58.90Full Papers 3313 2372 2958 58.27 52.83 55.41Paper Abstracts 17219 6329 9477 73.12 64.50 68.54Table 5: NegEx performance on identifying scopes of cor-rectly identified cues.
Precision and recall are computedbased on the number of correctly identified scope tokensexcluding punctuation (i.e.
number of tokens within cuescopes).
Best results were achieved with no scope windowsize (i.e.
using sentence boundaries).and hedge detection in clinical texts.
Using theNegEx algorithm and the FlySlip hedging corpus,without any modifications or additions, we wereable to achieve an impressive F-score of 90.92%and 86.33% for negation and speculation cue dis-covery respectively6.
We are currently expand-ing the set of speculation cues using an unan-notated dataset of clinical texts and a bootstrap-ping algorithm (Medlock, 2008).
The algorithmis based on the intuition that speculative cues tendto co-occur and this redundancy could be exploredto probabilistically discover new cues from high-confidence existing ones.
We are also exploringthe discovery of degree of speculativeness (e.g.very unlikely vs very likely).While NegEx performed well on the task ofidentifying negation scope (F-score 95.18), furtherwork is needed on the discovery of speculationscopes (F-score 58.90).
As hedging cues requirea more fine-tuned set of rules, in future work wewill evaluate linguistically motivated approaches(Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008) for the creation of aset of surface-level speculation scope rules.ReferencesW.W.
