The starting point for this project is the development of a new part-of-speech tag-ging scheme based on the EAGLES tagset guidelines, adapted to incorporate additional languageinternal features.
The tags are currently being used in a part-of-speech annotation task for thedevelopment of POS tagged Igbo corpus.
The proposed tagset has 59 tags.1 IntroductionSupervised machine learning methods in NLP require an adequate amount of training data.
The firstcrucial step for a part-of-speech (POS) tagging system for a language is a well designed, consistent, andcomplete tagset (Bamba Dione et al., 2010) which must be preceded by a detailed study and analysis ofthe language.
Our tagset was developed from scratch through the study of linguistics and electronic textsin Igbo, using the EAGLES recommendations.This initial manual annotation is important.
Firstly, information dealing with challenging phenomenain a language is expressed in the tagging guideline; secondly, computational POS taggers require anno-tated text as training data.
Even in unsupervised methods, some annotated texts are still required as abenchmark in evaluation.
With this in mind, our tagset design follows three main goals: to determinethe tagset size, since a smaller granularity provides higher accuracy and less ambiguity (de Pauwy et al.,2012); to use a sizeable scheme to capture the grammatical distinctions at a word level suited for furthergrammatical analysis, such as parsing; and to deliver good accuracy for automatic tagging, using themanually tagged data.
We discuss the development of the tagset and corpus for Igbo.
This work is, to thebest of our knowledge, the first published work attempting to develop statistical NLP resources for Igbo.2 Some Grammatical Features of the Igbo Language2.1 Language family and speakersThe Igbo language has been classified as a Benue-Congo language of the Kwa sub-group of the Niger-Congo family1and is one of the three major languages in Nigeria, spoken in the eastern part of Nigeria,with about 36 million speakers2.
Nigeria is a multilingual country having around 510 living languages1,but English serves as the official language.2.2 PhonologyStandard Igbo has eight vowels and thirty consonants.
The 8 vowels are divided into two harmony groupsthat are distinguished on the basis of the Advanced Tongue Root (ATR) phenomenon.
They are -ATR: i.
[I], u.
[U], a [A], o.
[O] and +ATR: i [i], u [u], e [e], o [o] (Uchechukwu, 2008).
Many Igbo words selecttheir vowels from the same harmony group.
Also, Igbo is a tonal language.
There are three distinct tonesThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/1http://nigerianwiki.com/wiki/Languages2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people93recognized in the language viz; High, Low, and Downstep.
The tones are represented as High [H] =[?
], Low [L] = [` ], downstep = [? ]
(Emenanjo, 1978; Ikekeonwu, 1999) and are placed above the tonebearing units (TBU) of the language.There are two tone marking systems, either: all high tones are left unmarked and all low tones anddownsteps are marked (Green and Igwe, 1963; Emenanjo, 1978), or only contrastive tones are marked(Welmers and Welmers, 1968; Nwachukwu, 1995).
We used the first system to illustrate the importanceof tonal feature in the language?s lexical or grammatical structure.
For example, at the lexical level theword akwa without a tone mark can be given the equivalent of ?bed/bridge?, ?cry?, ?cloth?, or ?egg?.But these equivalents can be properly distinguished when tone marked, as follows: akwa ?cry?, akw?
?cloth?, ?kw?
?bed or brigde?, ?kwa ?egg?.
At the grammatical level, an interrogative sentence can bedistinguished from a declarative sentence through a change in tone of the person pronouns from a hightone (e.g.
O.n?-?bi.a ?He is coming?)
to a low tone (e.g.
?.n?-?bi.a ?Is he coming??).
Also, there aresyllabic nasal consonants, which are tone bearing units in the language.
The nasal consonants alwaysoccur before a consonant.
For example: `ndo ?Sorry?
or explicitly tone marked as `nd?.2.3 Writing SystemThe Igbo orthography is based on the Standard Igbo by the O.nwu.Committee (O.nwu.Committee, 1961).There are 28 consonants: b gb ch d f g gh gw h j k kw kp l m n nw ny ?n p r s sh t v w y z, and 8 vowels(see phonology section).
Nine of the consonants are digraphs: ch, gb, gh, gw, kp, kw, nw, ny, sh.Igbo is an agglutinative language in which its lexical categories undergo affixation, especially theverbs, to form a lexical unit.
For example, the word form erichari.ri.is a verbal structure with fourmorphemes: verbal vowel prefix e-, verb root -ri-, extensional suffix -cha-, and a second extensionalsuffix -ri.ri.. Its occurrence in the sentence ?Obi must eat up that food?
is Obi ga-erichari.ri.nri ahu.,that is, Obi aux-eat.completely.must food DET.
Igbo word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), with acomplement to the right of the head.2.4 Grammatical ClassesGenerally, Emenanjo (1978) identified the following broad word classes for Igbo: verbal, nominal, nom-inal modifier, conjunction, preposition, suffixes, and enclitics.
The verbal is made up of verbs, auxiliariesand participles, while the nominal is made up of nouns, numerals, pronouns and interrogatives.
Nouns arefurther classified into five lexical classes, viz; proper, common, qualificative, adverbial and ideophones.However, we identified extra five in the tagset design phase (see the appendix).
Nominal modifiers occurin a noun phrase.
Its four classes are adjectives, demonstratives, quantifiers and pronominal modifiers.Conjunctions link words or sentences together, while prepositions are found preceding nominals and ver-bals and cannot be found in isolation.
Suffixes and enclitics are the only bound elements in the language.Suffixes are primarily affixed to verbals only, while enclitics are used with both verbals and other wordclasses.
Suffixes are found in verb phrase slots and enclitics can be found in both verb phrase and nounphrase slots.
The language does not have a grammatical gender system.3 Language ResourcesThe development of NLP resources for any language is based on the linguistics resources available for thelanguage.
This includes appropriate fonts and text processing software as well as the available electronictexts for the work.
The font and software problems of the language have been addressed through theUnicode development (Uchechukwu, 2005; Uchechukwu, 2006).
The next is the availability of Igbotexts.Any effort towards the Igbo corpus development is a non-trivial task.
There are basic issues connectedwith the nature of the language.
The first major surprise is that Igbo texts ?by native speakers?
written?for native speakers?
vary in forms due to dialectal difference and are usually not tone-marked.
Indeed,the tone marking used in the sections above are usually found in academic articles.
It would be strangeto find an Igbo text (literary work) that is fully tone marked and no effort has been made to undertake atone marking of existing Igbo texts.
Such an effort looks impossible as more Igbo texts are written and94published.
Such is the situation that confronts any effort to develop an Igbo corpus.
Hence, developingNLP resources for the language has to start with the available resources; otherwise, such an endeavourwould have to first take a backward step of tone marking all the texts to be added to its corpus andnormalizing the dialectal differences.
This is a no mean task.It is for this reason that we chose the New World Translation (NWT) Bible version for Igbo corpuswith its English parallel text3.
The NWT Bible does not adopt a particular tone marking system, neitheris there a consistent use of tone marks for all the sentences in the Bible.
Instead, there is narrow useof tone marks in specific and restricted circumstances throughout the book.
An example is when thereis a need to disambiguate a particular word.
For instance, ihe without tone mark could mean ?thing?
or?light?.
These two are always tone marked in the Bible to avoid confusion; hence ?h?
?light?
and ?h??thing?.
The same applies to many other lexical items.
Another instance is the placement of a low toneon the person pronouns to indicate the onset of an interrogative sentence, which otherwise would beread as a declarative sentence.
This particular example has already been cited as one of the uses of tonemark in the language.
Apart from such instances, the sentences in the Bible are not tone marked.
Assuch, one cannot rely on such restricted use of tone marks for any major conclusions on the grammar ofthe language.
With regard to corpus work in general, the Bible has been described as consistent in itsorthography, most easily accessible, carefully translated (most translators believe it is the word of God),and well structured (books, chapters, verses), etc.
(Resnik et al., 1999; Kanungo and Resnik, 1999; Chewet al., 2006).
The NWT Bible is generally written in standard Igbo.4 TokenizationWe outline here the method we used in the tokenization of the text.
For the sake of a start-up, wetokenized based on the whitespace.
The Igbo language uses whitespace to represent lexical boundaries;we used the following regex:Separate characters if the string matches:?
?ga-?
or ?n??
or ?N??
or ?na-?
or ?Na-?
or ?ana-?
or ?i.na-?
; for example, the followingsamples n?elu, na?erughari., i.na-akwa, ana-egbu in the Bible will be separated into n?,elu, na?, erughari., i.na-, akwa, ana-, egbu tokens.?
Any non-zero length sequence consisting of a?z, A?Z, 0?9, combining grave accent(` ), combining acute accent (?
), combining dot below (.
); for example, these words?h?, ah?., ?j?
in the corpus will be separated as tokens with their diacritics.?
Any single character from: left double-quotation mark (?
), right double-quotationmark (?
), comma (,), colon (:), semicolon (;), exclamation (!
), question (?
), dot (.).?
Any single non-whitespace character.In place of sentence splitting, we use verses since all 66 books of the Bible is written in verse level.
Ourmajor aim is to use this Igbo corpus to implement our new tagset, which will capture all the inflected andnon-inflected tokens in the corpus.
For lack of space, issues with tokenization with respect to morphemes,manual annotation implemetations and platform used will not be discussed in this paper.5 Tagset DesignWe adopt the (Leech, 1997) definition of a POS tagset as a set of word categories to be applied to thetokens of a text.
We designed our tagset following the standard EAGLES guidelines, diverging wherenecessary (e.g.
EAGLES, which favours European languages, specifies articles at the obligatory level,but this category does not apply for Igbo).
A crucial question in tagset design is the extent of fine-graineddistinctions to encode within the tagset.
A too coarsely grained tagset may fail to capture distinctions thatwould be valuable for subsequent analysis, e.g.
syntactic parsing; too fine-grained may make automatic(and manual) POS tagging difficult, resulting in errors that lead to different problems for later processing.In what follows, we introduce a sizeable tagset granularity with the intention of providing a basis forpractical POS tagging.3Obtained from jw.org.95NNM Number marking nouns NNT Instrumental nounsNNQ Qualificative nouns VrV ?rV implies suffixNND Adverbial nouns VCJ Conjunctional verbsNNH Inherent complement nouns ?_XS any POS tag with affixesNNA Agentive nounsTable 1: Selected distinctive tags from the tagset schemeThe tagset is intended to strike an appropriate balance for practical purposes regarding granularity,capturing what we believe will be the key lexico-grammatical distinctions of value for subsequent pro-cessing, such as parsing.
Further subcategorization of the grammatical classes, as described in section2.4, results in 59 tags which apply to whole tokens (produced by the tokenisation stage described above).An important challenge comes from the complex morphological behaviour of Igbo.
Thus, a verb suchas bi.a, which we assign the tag VSI (a verb in its simple or base form), can combine with extensionalsuffixes, such as ghi.and kwa, to produce variants such as bi.aghi., bi.akwa and bi.aghi.kwa, which exhibitsimilar grammatical behaviour to the base form.
As such, we might have assigned these variants the VSItag also, but have instead chosen to assign VSI_XS, which serves to indicate both the core grammaticalbehaviour and the presence of extensional suffixes.
In abi.akwa, we find the same base form bi.a, plus averbal vowel prefix a, resulting in the verb being a participle, which we assign the tag VPP_XS.
For thebenefit of cross-lingual training and other NLP tasks, a smaller tagset that captures only the grammaticaldistinctions between major classes is required.
The present 59 tags can easily be simplified to a coarse-grained tagset of 15 tags, which will principally preserve just the core distinctions between word classes,such as nouns, verb, adjective, etc.Athough Emenanjo (1978) classified ideophones as a form of noun, we have assigned them a sepa-rate tag IDEO, as these items can be found performing many grammatical functions.
For instance, theideophone ko.i., ?to say that someone walks ko.i.ko.i.?
has no nominal meaning, rather its function here isadverbial.
A full enumeration of this scheme is given in the appendix.5.1 The developement of an POS tagged Igbo CorpusHere we analyse the manual POS tagging process that is ongoing based on the tagset scheme.
TheBible books were allocated randomly to six groups, producing six corpora portions of approximately45,000 tokens each.
Our plan was for each human annotator to tag at least 1000 tokens per day, resultingin complete POS tagging in 45 days.
The overall corpus size allocated is 264,795 tokens of the newtestament Bible.
There are six human annotators, who are students of the Department of Linguistics atNnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, supervised by a senior lecturer in the same department; giving aneffective total of seven human annotators.
Additionally, a common portion of the corpus (38,093 tokens)was given to all the annotators, as a basis for calculating inter-annotator agreement.6 ConclusionsWe have outlined our current progress in the development of a POS tagging scheme for Igbo from scratch.Our project aims to build linguistic computational resources to support research in natural languageprocessing (NLP) for Igbo.
It is important to note that these tags are applicable on unmarked, not fullymarked, and fully tone marked Igbo texts, since the fully tone marked tokens play the same grammaticalroles as in the none tone marked texts, written by native speakers for fellow native speakers.Our method of tagset design could be used for other African or under-resourced languages.
Africanlanguages are morphologically rich, and of around 2000 languages in the continent, only a small numberhave featured in NLP research.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the support of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) in Nigeria, and would like tothank Mark Tice for his useful comments and help in preparing this paper.96ReferencesCheikh M.
