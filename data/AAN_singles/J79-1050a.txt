W A T S O N  RESEARCH CENTERYORKTWON WIGHTS, NEW YORK 10598ABSTRACT: This paper describes a loxical organization in which "scnscs" arc rcprcscnted i n  theirown right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinct data itcms.
The objcctivc of the scheme is tofacilitate recognition and employment of synonyms and stock phrases by programs which processnatural la,nguage.
Besides presenting the proposed organization, the paper characterizes thc lexical"senses" which result.1.
Introduction.-This paper describes an internal lexical organization which is particularly designed to capture thefacts about synonymy.
Besides recording the inclusion of each word in one or more synonym sets(identified with its various "senses"), the scheme attempts to distribute attributes per~picuouslybetween "senses", "wordings", and the intersections of the two.
I n  addition, there is provision torecord multi-word idioms, stock phrases, and the like.
and to include these as elements in synonymsets when appropriate.Briefly, "senses" are represented in their own right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinctdata items.
Each word or phrase is associated with a list of the "senses" which i t  can express;conversely, each "sense" is associated with a list of "alternative wo iings" Additionally.
eachword is associated with a list of phrases in which it occurs.Grammatical category, features, selection restrictions, and the like are applicable at three differentlevels: to words or phrases as such, to "senscs" as such, or to particular usages of words or phrases(equivalently, to particular wordings of "senses").An Organization for a Dictionary of Word SensesThis lexical organization has been inlplemerlted at 1BM Research, Yorktown Heights, N.Y., by aprogram -- not to  be described here -- which builds such dictionaries in a very compact form,giving interactive assistance to the person making the entries.
(For cxaniple, the plrogram p d n  tsout the possibility of merging "senses" whenever their wordings overlap and their attributes arccompatible, and merges them if so directed.)
There are suitable I'acilities for saving the results,retrieving them in various ways, and for altering such things as sclienies of classification w i t l i o ~ ~ ~scrapping previously prepared work.The ultimate intent is that the "dictionary of senses" should serve as the lexical coniponent in anatural language fact-retrieval system.
Pending its incorporation in that rolc, it will be used toamass and organize information on the semantic relations among words and phrases.The balance of this paper conies in two sections:Section 2 presents the proposed lexical data structures, and suggests haw they arc to be used.Included is a sketch of how various types of grammatical anri semantic "attributes" fit into thcscheme.Section 3 discusses the character of the "senses" encoded in the resulting dictictlary.
Reasons arcadvanced for regarding lexical "senses" as something far short of semantic primitives.
At the sametime, synonym sets are defended against the view that "true paraphrases are rare or rtonexistcnt".An Organization far a Dictionary of Word Senses2.
The Internal Remesentation.It will be our purpose in this section to say just enough about internal representation to lay barethe organizing principles of the lexicon.
The focus is on architecture afid motivations; details offield layouts, internal codes, etc.
are not at issue here.To make the discllssion concrete, suppose we are interested in the senses of the word "changevAssuming that none of the words are unfamiliar, the following should put us in mind of two senses:change: 1. v alter;2. n small coin.This, of course, is just a dictionary entry in the traditional format (though with synonyms offeredin lieu of definitions),On the other hand, we might approach the same information from a different direction: startingwith the two concepts, we might seek words to express them.
It is difficult to picture this lattersituation without assigning artificial labels to the concepts.
Call them concepts 1 and 2, andsuppose for a moment that there were a practical way to look the concepts up (witlzozlt havingthought of either word for either concept).
Then the information to be retrieved might be envi-sioned this way:I .
v change, alter2.
n change, small coinIt is this duality of viewpoint -- that words have senses, while senses have wordings -- that ourlexical representation must reflect.The starting point, then, is that words, phrases, and "senses" are separately represented.
There arethree principal types of data item, plus a standard connector:1.
A "Key Data Item " ( K D I )  represent:; a single word.2.
A "Phrase Data Item" (PDI)  represents a string of two or more words which are toserve as a unit in some context..An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses3.
A "Sense Data Item" (SDI) represents one distinct sense common to a set of wordqand/or phrases.
In general, a word or phrase may be usable in more than one sense,while a given sense may have alternative (synonymous) wordings.
Both these types ofvariability are recorded making use of the next data item:4.
A "Sertse Link Element" (SLE) is a connective item, to be explained shortly.Three principal fields will engage our attention in each type of data item.
Fig.

1Schematic of Data Items, with Principal Contents1"SenseChain"LinkEach KDI (Key Data Item) or PDI (Phrase Data Item) coiltains an "alternative senses" link -- alpointer to the first SLE (Sense Link Element) in a chain of SLE's which represent the varioussenses of the word or phrase.
The SLE's are chained via their own "alternative senses" links, andthe final member points back to the KDI or PDI.
Thus, we shall speak of such a chain as a ringLocalAttributes"AlternativeWordings"LinkAn Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 6specifically, an "alternative senses ring".
If no senses are on record for a particular word oxphra , the "alternative senses" link in the KDI or PDI is ssl: referent.Reciprocally, each SDI (Sense Data Item) contahs an "alt-native wordings" link.
This leads to achain of S L E ~ S  which represent more-or-less synonymous wordings mat express the sense.
TheseSLE's are chained through their own "alternative wordink links, and again the chain is closedinto a ring -- this time beginniog and ending with the SDI.The structure that is shaping up may now be seen in Fig.
2, The crtrcicrl poirir is that encll SLErepresents the intersection betwen nn "alternntive  sense^ ring nrrd an "cllterncirive wordi~rgs"ring.
From the standpoint of the word or phrase, it; represents a particular scnse; from thestandpoint of the sense, it represents a particular wordinkStarting from a KDI or PDI, one gets to the SDI for a particular sense by advancing along the"alternative senses" ring to the relevant SLE, then &touring along the ring which connects t h ~latter to the SDI (as one of the SDI's "alternative wordings").
Starting from an SDI, one gets to aparticular wording by the reverse process.
Since each "alternative senses" ring contains exactlyone KDI or PDI, while each "alternative wording#' ring contains exactly one SDI, each SLE is tiedto exactly one sense of one word or phrase.
(Eani~alently, it is tied to one wording of one sense.
)The next point of interest is that "attribute" f ' i~ lds  are present in all four types of data item -- evenin the connectors (SLE's).
The attributes which may be recorded in each, however, come fromdifferent bags.To  begin with, the attributes found in an SDI characterize a11 the wordings of a given sensewhenever the wording-, are used in that sense.
In Fig.
2, for example, sense " I "  should be markedas a "verb" sense, whil?
sense "2" is a "noun".
One would not wish to record the attribute "verb"in the KDI for the word "change", for the KDI represents facts about the word itself, irrespectiveof sense, and "verb" does no!
'hold for all uses of the word "change".
On the other hand, "verb"does characterize all wordings of sense "I", whenever they're being employed to express thatsense.
It would furthermore apply to any additional wordings which we might think of, such as"modify", provided they are really used in a synonymous way.As a matter of fact, it turns out that the traditional parts of speech -- noun, verb, adjective,preposition, etc.
-- fit best in this scheme as global attributes of senses, recorded i l l  the SDI's.An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Sensessenses of "alter"Fig.
2"Alternative Senses" and "Alternative Wordings" Rings(The first sense has two wordings: "alter" and "change".
The second sense has wordings "change"and "small coin".
Two senses are recorded for "change", and one sense each for "alter'.'
and"small coin".
)A different sort of attribute may be recorded in a KDI, as a global feature of the word itself.
Forexample, we may note of the word "change" that it is "regularly conjugated".
That is, when usedAn Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 8as a verb, it forms the third person singular by adding "s", and both past ~ n d  past participle byadding "ed" To be sure, this "global" attribute applies only to the "verb" senses of "change"; buta moment's reflection will confirm that "change" has more than one "verb" sense, and theregularity of its conjugation is common to all of them.
Thus, it is useful to note this regularity as anattribute of the word itself.
(Contrast this with the behavior of the word "can", which is regularw h n  it means "to pack in cans", but irregular when it means "is able to".
)Various other attributes suggest themselves as global characterizers of the words thcn~selvcs, to bcrecarded in the KDI's.
For example, one might wish to note of "change" that it drops its final "e"whon adding "ing" (this is the normal rule) but of "singe" that it doesn't.Still other attributes are appropriate when characterizing multi-word units (in PDl's).
A string o fwords whose meaning is not evident from the nlere juxtaposition of its constittlents (such as "givcup") may be classified as an "idiom", A string of words whose meaning could be figured out fromthe meanings of its constituents, but which occurs with enough frequency to warrant inclusion inthe dictionary, might be classed as a "stock phrase".
(Example: "drop dead".)
A string like"perform in a subordinate role", which one would not normally expect to encounter in its ownright, might be classed as a "definition" (for a certain sense of the word "accompany", difficult toreword except with a definition).Perhaps the most unexpected site for recording attributes is in the connective elements (SLE's).These are the logical place, though, to note features that apply to a specific sense of a word,without being global to either the sense or the word.
Consider the following four senrenccs:On the way to the office, he stopped daydreaming.On the way to the office, he ceased daydreaming.On the way to the office, he ceased to daydream.versus:On thebway to the office, he stopped to daydream.Suppose we choose to view this as a restriction upon the (surface) object of the verb: "stop", whenapplied to an action, must take a gerund as its object; "cease" can take either a gerund or aninfinitive.
(It wouldn't affect the point being made if we said that "stop" inhibits a certaingrammatical transformation en route to surface structure, while "cease" pennits it.
)An Organization tur a Dictionary of Word Senses 9Now, we wouldn't want to mark "gerund object only" as a global.
attribute of the sense, for wehave just shown that "cease" and "stop", two wordings of the sense, differ with respect to thisrestriction.
On the other hand, it doesn't belong among the global attributes of the word "stop" assuch, for "stop" has other verb senses, even transitive ones, tu which the restriction is completelyinapplicable.
(Consider "stop a hole in the dike", "stop a catastrophe", etc.)
That leaves thealternative we are suggesting: treat the restriction as an attribute of one particular usage of thcword (equivalently, one particular wording of the sense).Fig.

Fig.

I'n the KDI for each word, there is a l inkconnecting it to the PDI for the first phrase in which the word is known to occur, together with anumber designating the position of the word (Ist, Znd, 3rd.
etc.)
in that phrase.
In  the PDI itself,there is a coiltinuation link for each word of the phrase, together with its niiri~ber in the nextphrase.
In the final PDI involving a given word, the link for that word points back to the KDI.Thus, independent of its "altcrnative senses" ring, each KDI tnay hmc r~ "phrase invol\~cit~ents"ring.This structure makes i t  possible to retrieve all the idioms, stock phrases, definitions, etc., in whicha given word has made its appearance, anywhere in the dictionary.
As the same structure is used toencode every multi-word unit, no occurrence of a word is ever lost sight of, and r~ phrase can belooked up via any of its constituent words.Of the fields to which Fig.
1 calls attention, we have discussed all but one.
In the SDI for each"sense", tbpre is a "sense chain" link field.
This links the SDI to its successor in a global chain of"senses".
Using this chain, it is possible to make an exhaustive, non-duplicative list of all the"senses" recorded in the dictionary.
The listing program has only to proceed down the chain,retrieve frdm each SDI its attributes, decode them, then chase around the "alternative wordings'ring of the SDI and list the wordings alongside the attributes.One more feature of the internal representation deserves mention: the data items for words occuras "leaves" in a lexical tree (Fig.
4).
That is, the KDI for a word can be looked u p  letter-by-letter,following a chain of pointers that correspond to successive letters.
The chain ends at a KDI afterfollowing a substring sufficient to distinguish the word fro111 the nearest thing like i t  in thcdictionary.
The lexical tree has the advantage that words can be looked up  either at random or insequence.Recapitulating, these are the essential features of the representation:*1) "Senses" are represented separately from "wordings", and the mutual connectionsbetween them are made explicit in both directions.
*2) "Wordings" may be either single words or multi-word pnrases.
I hese are representea bydistinct types of data item, and may be subject to distinct schemes of classification.
butthey are on the same footing with regard to "sense" connections.
With each word isassociated an exhaustive list of the phrases in which it  occurs.An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses(start)I"monkey"B"above" &,Fig.

Alternative implementations of individtlal points (though notof the scheme as a whole) have in fact been described by other writers.
Tlte lexical tree ( * S ) ,  forexample, is no great novelty: Sydney M Lamb and William H. Jacobsen describe implementationdetails of one such tree [SJ.

systems by R. F. Simnlons ([I l l ,  [12]) and by Larry R. Harris (31.
This way of looking atmatters led Harris to remark some of the same points that we have been stressing: that senses havealternative wordings just as words have alternative senses; that multi-word phrases might occur onthe same footing as individual words in the expression of a sense; and (interestingly enough) thatpart-of-speech information really adheres to the "sense", not to the "word" Similarly, Simmonsassociates his "deep case" information with lexical nodes representing "wordsenscs",, while wordsthe~nselves are treated as "print image" attributes of the wordsenses.Harris's dictionary was only a minor component in a small-scale model of concept acquisition.
Nogreat number of either words or concepts was required to illustrate the principles at stake, soHarris programmed the dictionary as an array, with words represented by rows and "concepts" bycolumns.
Elements of the array were merely frequencies, indicating the strength of associationbetween each word and each concept.Needless to say, for a full-scale vocabulary of words and concepts, such an array is mostly empty;nobody would dream of expanding it in that form.
From a programming standpoint, the onlythinkable choice is some form of list structure.
Having decided in principle to use "some form oflist structure", though, one might well ask: Why chains?
Why rings?
Why not just include in eachKey Data Item a full list of pointers to the corresponding Sense Data Items.
and vice-versa?The answer is simply one of convenience.
It's easier to handle insertions and deletions when theydon't require the movement of expanded items to new quarters, or the provision of "overflow"pointers.
It's easier to reclaim freed storage when deleted items come in a handful of standardAn Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 13sizes.
As for "rings", they eliminate the need for two-way pointers, since one can break into a ringat any point and follow it to its source.It should be noted that to make rings an attractive representation, the details of the material beingrepresented must cooperate, In particular, the rings must not become too long, or the processingrequlred to follow them becomes excessive.
It happens that "alternative senses" rings and"alternative wordings" rings are typically short rarely more than a dozen links per ring.
"Phraseinvolvement" rings, on the other hand, can become spectacularly long, especially for words like"a*' and "to".
In practice, it's necessary to provide these rings with short-cut links.Any of these, programming details could be altered, however, without abando~ting tltc ossencc ofthe scheme, which is given in points * 1 through * 5  above.An OqginiZatioh for a Dictionary of Word Senses3.
The Character of Lexical Senses.-- -Pe~haps the first tljing to get straight about the "senses" represented in this dictionary is what theyare not.
They are aot "concepts"; they are not a set of "primitives" into which human  espurlcnccan be decomposed, No conjecture is put forivard here [hot any such collcrtion of discrete, i~tr~riiicconcepts even exists, let ulonc that i t  might be finite.Rather, the "senses" of the dictionary are in thc nr.urc of fuzzy equivalcncc sets among worcis.
(This is only a metaphor; we shall do more and more violence to thc ttchnicul notion of an"equivalence set" as we proceed.)
Each "sense" groups n set of words which, in n set of appr:~pri-ate cu.ntexts; might be tiscd ~nore or less intcrchangenbly.

desert, leave, forsake, abdicate)Clearly, there is a common theme that can run through all of these, given the right circumstances.It might be expressed as "reluctant parting from somebody or something".
This can be seen bycoupling the verbs with var.ious possible objects:(abandon, give up, surrender) a town to the enemy(abandon, give up) all hope(give up, relinquish) one's claim to an estate(give up, let go) our entire stock at a loss(abandon, desert, leave) one's wife and children(desert, forsake) a friend in need(give up, abdicate) the throneAn Organhtion for a Dictionary of Word Senses(abandon, desert) an exhausted mine(forsake, give up) all other, keeping thee only to her/him(abandon, desert, leave) the area threatened by the stormShould we, then, declare this group of words to be a "sense"?
There are difficulties.
The variouswords carry nuances, which it may or may not be easy to ignore in a particular context,"Forsake", for example, can suggest that there is something reprehensible about the action.
It canalso connote formal renunciation, and the above example from a marriage vow shows that theformality can be present without the reprehensibility.
Nuances get in the way of interchangeabili-ty; it would sound strange to substitute "desert" into the marriage vow.Besides nuances, the individual words have conventional areas of application.
One does notnormally say that the doctors "deserted" all hope, or that an errant husband "surrendered" hiswife and children.
The minister officiating at a wedding would be considered daft if be adjured thebride and groom to "abdicate" all others, and a merchant would not advertize that he was"relinquishing" his entire stock at a loss.
(Somehow, the larkr situaaon calls for more pedestrianlanguage.
)At the opposite extreme, overawed by this lack of interchangeability, we might decide to respectthe unique personality of each word, abolishing equivalenioe classes altogether.
The inconvenienceof such a cop-out is obvious: we then have to introduce some other mechanism for recognizing theequivalence of utterances that are intended synonymously, though they employ different words.But beyond being inconvenient, the exclusion of equidence sets is a denial of linguistic facts --just as bad, in its own way, as the naive attribution of unconditional synonymy.For it is a commonplace of everyone's experience that the speaker and the listener agree to ignorethe nuances of words, whenever nuances get in the way of communication.
A writer who has usedthe word "give up" eight times in five lines will surely cast about for some alternative ways ofsaying the same thing.
If "relinquish" and "abandon" would normally be too flowery, or if"mender" would in other circumstances call to mind an armistice ceremony in a railway wagon.that will not deter the writer from tossing in a few occurrences of those words -- once a contexthas been established that discourages the overtones.
Nor will the reader understand matters anydifferently.
It is as if writer and reader conspired: "We're fed up with that word, let's hearanother."
Or, perhaps, the writer simply connives at jolting the reader awake with frequentchanges of idiom, maybe even an occasional incongruity.
En any case, synonymy is imposed upanAn Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 16the words, and this literary behavior merely exaggerates what people do habitually in cbmmonspeech.Not only can words be stripped of nuances normally present; they can toke on colorationssuggested by the context.
The suggestion of "reluctance" conveyed by all thc verbs of our examplecan be inferred, in at least one case, from the setting alone; and in this case, a variety of rnorcneutral verbs could be used synonymously:(part with, take leave of) our entire stock at a lossOne could even substitute the word "sell", and it wouldn't change the meaning that was alreadybad into the utterance.
But to adnlit contest-dependent synonyniy of this clcgrcc is to strctch theequivalence sets" to thc point of uselessness.It comes to this: neither the grouping nor the separation of words can be fully justified.
Groupingis nearly always conditional, and separation is often so.
If one could anticipate all possible contextsin which a group of words could occur, one could perhaps enumerate all possible equivalence sets-- one for each combination of word group with a set of contexts making the words interchangea-ble.
Anyone, however, can see the futility of that aspiration.In the end, one settles for messy compromises.
Words are grouped if a largish set of contexts inwhich they are interchangeable springs readily to mind.
They are separated (into perhaps overlap-ping groups) if the imagination readily suggests contexts in which their meanings differ"significantly" -- whatever "significantly" may mean.
In doubtful cases, when words are groupedsomewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add markings some clay that will prevent misuseof the equivalence.
When words are separated somewhat questionably, one promises oneself toadd a mechanism some day that will recognize their relatedness.In the end, too, one assigns internal structure to the equivalence sets.
That's the effect of assigninglocal attributes to the alternative wordings ("animate subject", "object a vehicle", etc.
): const-raints are imposed upon the interchangeability of the wordings.
More radical structuring can beaccomplished if, for example, one notes "government" as an alternative wording of the sense"govern, rule, control", with the attribute "nominalization".A trenchant discussion of such difficulties may be found in Kelly and Stone [4].
There theemphasis is upon disambiguation: given a word in a passage of text, they seek to identify (byselection from a fixed list of possibilities) the sense in which it is used.
Building a computerizedAn Organization for a Dictionary of Word Sensesdictionary for the purpose, they soon became concerned with the arbitariness and the proliferationof target "senses", as taken from standard desk dictionaries.
They argue, with persuasive exam-ples, that what lexicographers conventionally distinguish as separate senses of a word are often justapplications of the word's underlying concept to different contexts.
To cover the various contexts,the underlying concept has to be stretched a little, by a process of metaphoric extension.
Thismetaphoric process is beyond our present power to computerize, but for 'the long run looksindispensable for successful language processing.
Meanwhile, the authors advocate a dictionarywhich records for each word as few discrete senses as practicable, combining into one scnsc all theusages which can reasonably be united by a common underlying thougl~t.It is interesting to re-examine Kelly and Stone's argument with a diffcrent task in n~inii: not tiledisambiguation of one word, but the recognition of synonymy between two words.
A n~etaphoricalcapability would be as useful for the one task as for the other, but in the case of synonynl rccogni-tion, some of the considerations which have guided traditional lexicography remain pertinent.
Inparticular, it is necessary to ask not merely whether the concepts overlap, but whether the oneword may in fact be used in place of the other.
As noted before, usage is restricted by conventionaldomaitls of application; for example, an "alteration" is conceptually both a "change" and a"modification", but one wouldn't call it a change or a modification when painting a sign for atailor's shap.The arbitrariness of the equivalence sets is not all that disqualilies then1 as "conceptualprimitives".
There is a much deeper difficulty in the fact that practically all "senses" can beparaphrased in terms of other "senses".
Take, for example, the intransitive sense of "change" (asin "My, but you've changed!").
Surely, one would suppose, the concept of "change" must beprimitive?
Change of state is what well-nigh a third of all verbs are about.But if "change" is a "primitive", it's a peculiar sort of "primitive", for i t  can be paraphrased in avariety of ways:(change, become different, cease to be the same, assume new characteristics, make atransition into a new state)Note that the multi-word paraphrasals are not idioms; the individual words contribute their usualmeaqings to concatenated meanings which express the concept "change".An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 18But perhaps we were merely unlucky?
Perhaps we chanced upon a concept which looked elementalbut actually turned out to be complex.
Maybe the real primitives are "become", "be", "cease","different", "same", etc.
Let's dig into that possibility.What does it mean to "become X", where X is an adjective?
The meaning can bc \~ario\islyexpressed:(become X, come to bq X, get to be X, get X, turn X, grow X, assume thc charrtctcris-tic X)That's a discouraging number of ways for a "primitive" to be re-expressible -- though if  we chooseto regard "come to be" and "get to be" as idiomatic concatcnr\tions of words, only onc of thealternatives makes use of other concepts to explain the one at hand.As for "different", it implies a whole underlying anecdote about sortlebody making a contparisoi~,after first making a judgment about relevant things to compare.
In the combination of the twoconcepts -- "become different" --, we furthermore drop mention of the objects being compared.It's simply understood that they are certain attributes of the subject at two points in time.It is tempting to invent ad-hoc "transformational" explanations for these phenomena.
One mightconjecture, for example, tliat "The man changed."
is a surface realization of four underlyingsentences:(Man be X at time m. Man be Y at time n. X not equal Y, Time n greater-than time n ~ .
)Thetrouble  with explanations of this sort -- apart from the fact that they introduce growingcomplexity into the understanding of straightforward utterances -- is that they assign arbitraryprimacy to some concepts at the expense of others.
Why should"time n greater-than time m"be an assumed primitive?
May we not equally well conjecture that "time n greater-than time m" isa surface realization of these?
:(Time be m. Time change.
Then time be n.)For that matter, why not viewAn Organization for a Dictibnary of Word Senses"Time elapsed.
"as a surface form of this?
:"At least one thing in the universe changed.
"After all, what is "time" but a nominalized way of talking about the presence and partitioning ofchange?The difficulty, it would seem, lies in the very notion of context-independent "conceptualprimitives".
The metaphor itself is at fault: it calls to mind a fixed set of dements, like thosc ofwhich matter is composed, out of which all ideus must be compounded.
But where concepts arcconcerned, primitivity is a matter of focus, Shift the perspective a little, and new elenlcnts swiminto view as fundamentals, while former simples become con~plex.A more promising metaphor is the analogy to a 'vector space.
A set of basis vectors is, in a way, aset of "primitives" out of which all the entities in the space can be composed.
These primitiveshave the appealing property that they are only primitive relative to one frame of reference.
Rotatcyour point of view, and what used to come natural as basis vectors are now at an angle; theybecome easier to express as sums of vectors that lie along new axes.
That bears a resemblance towhat we have seen,in tlhe case of lexical "primitives".Thus far and no further may the analogy be pushed, however.
The elements which span"conceptual space" can be no such uniform set of objects as those in a vettor space, while therules of composition are coextensive with grammar -- at a minimum.
Composition of conceptsitself contributes to the meaning.
(For that matter, it is arguable whether concepts are sufficientlyseparable to model them as discrete objects at all -- whether simple or composite.)
Moreover as"conceptual space" must encompass all things thinkable, the rules of composition must themselvesbe part of the space.
That is, the operators as much as the things operated upon lie within the spaceto be spanned.A seming counterexample to these remarks may be found in the "primitive ACT's" of conceptualdependency theory, as propounded by Schank, Goldman, Rieger, and Riesbeck (121, [7], [8], [9]).On a close reading, however, the "primitive ACT's" turn out to be verb paradigms -- powerful,semantically motivated generalizations about large classes of verbs.
The names of these paradigmsreplace specific verbs as building blocks in the "conceptual" representation of an utterance.
TheAn manbation f ~ r  a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 0effect is to provide strong guidelines for the inference of unstated information, for the comparisonof related utterances, for paraphrasal, etc.TO represent a particular verb in terms of these ACT's, however, i t  is necessary to augment eachACT with various substructures which detail the manner, the means, the type of actor or object,etc.
No reduced set of representatives is as yet offered for the adverbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.
interms of which the "primitive ACT's" are qualified.
If such additional condcnsntion wercattempted, the elaboration of a given utterance in terms of the full set of "primitives" might wellramify without practical end.
In other words, reduction of the set of names L'or nodes (and labelsfor arcs) must be purchased at the expense of extending the number of them required to representeach utterance,In conceptual dependency representation, just as in the sernantic networks" of Quillinn [ 6 ] ,Simmons ([I I], [12]), Slocum, and others, reality ultimately appears as a shimmering web, everypart of which trembles when any part of it is touched upon.
Taken in its totality, the system -- asyet -- is entirely compatible with skepticism about a corrrprehensive set of "conceptual primitives"In any case, the verbal "senses" proposed here lie at a far lower level of generality than the"primitive ACT's" used in conceptual dependency theory.
In terms of that theory, they comeclosest to the so-called "CONCEXICON entries" used by Goldman in realizing surface expres-sions 'of a concept from its conceptual representation [2].
Given a primitive ACT, Goldmannarrows it down to a particular "CONCEXICON" entry by applying the tests in a discrin~inationtree to the rest of the structure in which the ACT appears.Our lexical "senses", therefore, are lcft with a humbled role.
If they span anything, it might bestbe thought of as "communication space", not "conceptual space".
Even in this light, they arc ahugely redundant basis, and a not at all unique one.
They form no inventory of the experiencesbeing communicated about; "meaning" is still a step removed, still evoked rather than embodiedby the elements of this basis.If we persist in calling these things "senses", it is because that is the traditional term for what isbrought to mind as the synonym sets of a given word are enumerated.
The tie-in with meaning istenuous, but the human user is able to supply it.
There is at least this much justification for theterm: synonym sets, more forcefully than words, direct attention to the points at which a tie-inmust be made between the tokens of communication and the underlying representation of "worldknowledge"An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 1In a full-fledged system for processing natural language, then, we must envision the "dictionary ofsenses" as a component stretching vertically across the "upper" layers.
Its "sense data items" mustlink, ifi some way, to the deeper-lying data structures which encode "knowledge of the world" (the"pragmatic component").
The "key data items" and "phrase data items" register tokens to beexpected or employed in "surfzrce" utterances.
Global and local attributes recorded in the variousdata items guide parsing and interpretation.
Where one takes i t  froin there depends upon thclinguistic approach to be used.An Organization for a Dictionary of Word SensesReferences:[ I ]  Feigenbaum.

91ROBOTICSGENERALPutnam and Clarke and Mind and BodyYorick WilkesArti f icial Intelligence Laboratory, Stan fordBrilish Journal for the Philosophy o f  Science 26:213-225, Seprrrnber I975 l S S N  0007-0882Putnam argues f o r  a satirical privacy for  machines by asserting that, just us it makes no senseto ask John  how he knows that he is in pain, so i t  makes no  sense to ask a Turing Machine(TM) how it knows that it is in stnte n. When addressed to an abstract Tb1 the question isabsurd, but not when addressed to a physically realized TM.
Putiirlm equivocates about thenotion of stnte, discussirig only abstract TM's when introducing the notion of state, bu tmaking an argument which is cohcrer~t only with respect ot  a physicaliy r en l i~cd  TM.
Thereis thus, in  effect, n cot)fusion between 'state' as of an ai1t0111;lt n rind 'stnte' as of a real Y machine which is executing a program which rcalizes that automaton--any of a i iun~ber  ofstates of the machine might correspond to one state of  the nutonlaton embodied in  theprogranl.
Thus Putnam's argument fails.
Clarke's criticisms of Putnam are rilisguided butinstructive.

Fourier transform methods have been used to establish acorrespondence between the quality of  the reconstructed compressed speech waveforms and thesubjective recognition of compressed speech.
The result of two psychoacot~stic experimentsindicate that 1) the interruption frequency should be equal to  the pitch frequency of  thevoice waveform f o r  optimum recognition of the compressed speech, and 2) smoothing of thediscontinuities with electronic techniques significantly improves the recognition of thecompressed speech.
The  optimum smoothing parameters, window width and characteristicfunction, are also obtained from this study.PHONETICS-PHONOLOGY 37On the Characteristics of Individual Vowels and the Statistical Characteristicsof Formant Frequency Patterns in Connected SpeechY oshbari KanamoriResearch l n s ~ i t u f e  o/ Elecirical Communication, Tohoku Universily, Sendai 980, JapanSysrems - Compurers - Conrrols, 6, No.

space.
The areas enclosing these loci were obtained for  each vowel.The positions of vobels i n  connected speech lie inside an area surrounded by the isolatedvowels because of the neutralization s f  vowels io connected speech.
The faster the speakingr3 c, the more the areas tend to concentrate deeper inside.
Also, the areas of individualvowels overlap each other and the Caster the speaking rate, the more the overlapping areasincrease.
The overlapping areas were estimated in FI-F2 space and, to investigate the effectof F in F1;F2-FJ space.
The distribution of F is nearly approximated by the normaldensi ?

Areas reflecting the bound ofarticulatory movement in the acoustic domain were obtained from the loci of formantfrequencies represented i n  F1-FZ and FI-F3 spaces.
We conclude with a comparison of thediscussed areas and those obtained from the artlculatsry model by Lindblorn.Epoch Extraction of Voiced Speech'r.

Some typical glottal waveshapes are considered to explain their effect ofthe speech output.
The points of excitation of the vocal tract can be precisely identified forcontinuous speech and it is possible to obtain accurate pitch information by this method evenfor high-prtched sounds.PHONETICS-PHONOLOGY: RECOGNITIONReal-Time Digital Hardware Pitch DetectorRonald W .

Formant tracks were computedf o r  each sound under investigation using covariance-type pitch-asynchronous linear predictiontogether with a root-finding algorithm.
The  interspeaker variability of about 200measurements made on these formant  tracks was compared initially with intrnspeakervariability through the palculation of F ratios.
Those with average F ratios greater than 80were evaluated further  with a probability-of-error criterion.
Features that are potentiallymost effective in identifying speakers are the minimum second-formant value in  [ar], themaximum first-formant value in [ar], the maximum second-formant values of [o], a n d  [ 11.and the minimum third-formant value of [ ] The individual differences apparent in thesesounds presumably depend mor t  on speaker habits than on vocal-tract anatomy.

For each of the separate displays (i.e., waveform,autocorrelation, and cepstrum) an independent estimate o f  the pitch period is made on  aninteractive basis with the computer, and the final pitch period decision is made by the userbased on  results of each of the meacurements.

The  pitchextractor uses an adaptive digital filter in time-domain transforming the speech signal into asignal similar to the glottal waveform.
Using the levels of the speech signal and thedifferenced signal as parameters in tim,e domain, the subsequent segmentation algorithmderives a signal parameter which describes the speed of articulatory nlovenient.
From this.the signal is divided into "stationary" and "transitional" segments; one stationary segment isassociated to one phoneme.
For the formant  tracking procedure a subset of the pitch periodsis selected by the seglnentation algorithm and is t ransfor~ned into freque~icy domain.

Linear regression analysis of pitchpatterns allows a 4-way classification of slopes of lines: fast rising, rising, level, falling.These are the 4 Fundamental Pattern Features (FPF).
A combination of 2 or  3 (of the 4)FPF's per segment of utterance is a pitch pattern (80 possible).
An intonation pattern is ac o m ~ i i ~ a t i o n  of pitch patterns.
The position of the highest frequency v d u e  in the utteranceis important.
In comparing 2 utterances.
if the high point occurs in different segments theintonations are contrastive even if the pitch patterns are the same.
Of the 80 possible pitchpatterns, some must be recognized as cardinal patterns and same as cognate patterns to  thecardinal patterns.

The most si~ccessful classification i~iethod involved a linearly-mean-corrected minimum distance measure, on a 30-point spectral representation with asquare (or  cube) norm.
Straight minimum distance is the worst performer.
The question ofappropriate point representation is really one of adequate information retention.
The SO-point representation contains too many components above 3 k H z  while 20- and 10-pointrepresentations contain insufficient information relative to the classes to be discriminated.The value of the norm exponent primarily relates to the weight given extrerrla in the normkernel; a heavier weighting (2  o r  3) should be placed on extrerna.PHONETICS-PHONOLOGY: RECOGNITION: CHINESESpeech Recognition and Chinese Voice Input for ComputerKung-Pu LiTRW Systems Group, One Spoce Park,  Redondo Beach, CaliforniaS.

There a re four tonemes in Mandarin Chinese; the pitch con tourscover only the final part of the syllable.
In the vowel part of a syllable, although sevenphonen~es are sufficient to describe all possible vowels, the final can also con tuin dipthorigsand tripthongs composed of more than one vowel phoneme.

The results of analyzing, by means of sonagrams obtained from ten male voices,show that the 16 vowel phonemes can be classified into two classes as single and compoundedvowel sounds.
Some of the synthesized single vowels are very monotonic and can berecognized.
Others, with third formant frequency slightly greater than 3 K H z  are not asclear, due to the fast decaying of high frequency components in the generated pulses.
Thecompounded vowels are also synthesized by a step variation of formant frequency derivedfrom its components.
The result is also well recognizable.
The sonogram analysis of acontinuous Chinese speech shows that every word and its spelling phonemes are quiteindependent and separable, and are therfore very different from English speech.WRITING 44Gra hemic Synthesis: The Ultimate Solution to the Chinese Input/OutputPro I iemCarl LebanThe University of Kansas, LawrenceS.

1) Calculatethe position of each radical and the area occupied by each in t h e  character.
2)  Compresseach radical and place the radicals illto their right positions.
There a re  seven methods f o rrepresenting the radical system i n  a computer: 1) do t  matrix method, 2) absolute line segmentmethod ( the method adopted in implementing the system).
3) relative line seement method, 4)core method, 5) chain code method (basically a line segment method), 6 )  analytical method,7) mixed mode, which requires the smallest memory space (7.992 K Bytes) to store all 496radicals.WRITING: CHARACTER SETS: CHINESE 5 3The Upper-Right Corner Indexing System for Chinese Language and a NewChinese Character Encoding SystemT.

100 common radicals were selected for use iq thesystem and nearly 70% of the chnracters belong to class 2.
Since most of thel commonradicals are on the left sides of characters, we suggest indexing a cllarncter according to i t supper o r  right stroke form.
In the resulting system i t  is necessary to learn only 47 indices,The characters as well as the n u i n  parts are equally distributed under the indices.
The systemis easy to learn, fast in operation, has a large vocabulary, low in cost and is readilyimplen~entable on a mini-computer,WRITING: CHARACTER SETS: CHINESECharacter Identification Using the Phonetic Code and the Four-Corner Code (in Chinese)T. h e ,  an C.

April-June 1975A collection of English language data based on free associcition is organized as a network:node = word, arc = associative frequency.
We obtained 100 responses f o r  each of 8,400words; the net has 56,000 nodes.
For  each of  35,000 words we can obtain an environment ofrelated words a n d  this environment is fairly large and relevant in content for  8400 s t imi~luswords.
The  environment can be clustered into subsets, which turn ou t  to  be a semanticsorting of the environment.
The search can be forward (stimulus to associate), inverse, or inboth directions.
Since growing environments can produce ponderously large subsets ofnetwork, environments are l in~i ted  by techniques involving transmittance to each node, thenumber of paths traversed which lead to  each node, path length, and a frequency cut-off.
Itseems better to consider forward and  inverse environments separately.GRAMMAR 59Optimal Encoding of Linguistic lnforma tionliazu hi ko OzekiN H K ( J a p a n  Broadcosting Corporation) Technical Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Jopan 157Sysfenis - Computers - Confrols 5, No.

A senttnce is parsed first andtransformed into a sentence dtrivstion, and then this derivation, expressed as a string ofresults of "productions," is coded by coding each production.
For this coding procedure, it  isshown that* if the productions are divided into groups of the same left-hand side and if eachproduction group is 'Huffman-coded, then the mean code length is less than the sum of theentrop,y and the mean number of steps of sentence derivations.

However, in investigating the information theoretic properties of a long text isconvenient to use a scfg-based system which returns to the start symbol and begins theeeneration of another sentence as soon as it  completes the generation on one sentence.
The Csystem becomes a Markov chain having the set of all derivations as the state space, which iscalled hece the Markov chain associated with an scfg It turns out that: 1)  The Markov chainassoicated with an scfg is irreducible.
2 )  For the chain to be recurrent i t  is necessary andsufficient that the language generated by the scfg be a probability space.
3) For the chain tobe positive recurrent, it is necessary and sufficient that the mean number of steps of thesentence derivations be finite.
4) It is well known that when a Markov chain is positiverecurrent it has an invariant distribution and its entropy per step HI is defined.
If an scfgsatisfies certain conditions, we have HI = H(E)/(M(E) + 1).GRAMMAR: GENERATOR 60On the Generation of English SentenceFranz HuberCardiovascular Pulmonary Research Laboratory, Universily o f  Colorado Medical Center,Denver 80220l E E E  Transactions o f  Coniputers 25:90-91, January 1976Beckniann's error-detecting code model for the structure of natural languages is used in asimple efficient procedure f o r  generating a large number of English sentences with simplegramni;~ticnl structure atid a high rate of word repetition--such as dingrioslic messages of  acompiler, messages i n  interactive systems, etc.

Watson Research Cetrter, hiat/~ernatical Scimces Department, Yorktown Heigkrs,  NewYorkIBM Research Report 5577, 17 August 1975Some of the arguments which have been given both fo r  and against the use of naturallanguages in  qnestioning-answering ( Q A )  systems are  discussed.
The following systems areconsidered in evaluatingr the current level of Q A  system development: LSNLIS, REL,SHRDLU.
REQUEST There is a trade-off between syntactic and semantic complexity.
Ayystem with relatively simple syntactic capabilities must have complex semantic analysisprocedures while a system, such as REQUEST, with sophisticated syntax can producei~nderlying syntactic structures which directly reflect meaning without the need f o r  "creative"interpretation.
A brief comparison between processing times in LSN LlS and REQUEST isgiven.SEMANTICS-DISCOURSE: MEMORY: QUESTION ANSWERINGQuestion Answering in a Story Understanding SystemWendy LehnertDeparrmenl of Computer Science, Yale UniversityResearch Report 57, December 1975This theory of question answering is based on the SAM (Script Applier Mechanism)mechanism.
In the interpretative phase i t  takes a question in  Conceptual Dependency formand categorizes i t  i n  terms of particular question types: 1) why.
2) how, 3) yes or no, 4)occurrence, 5) component.
Each question type corresponds to a specific form of CDrepresentation.
In  the response phase the memory is searched for the answer; this mayinvolve nothing more than simple inforni:itioi~ retrieval or i t  may entail inferring the answerusing gener;ll knowledge of the world.
The systenl tries for co~npleteness in  answering; ayes/no q\~estion will be answered with yes or no plus an account of that answer.
Work isbeing done on a Generation-Selection paradigm in which each question generates a numberof feasible answers (the problem of memory representation) and a selection procedure choosesamong them (pure QA).
Selection rules are presented and discussed.SEMANTICS-DISCOURSE: TEXT GRAMMARBeyond the Sentence, Between Linguistics and LogicJanos S. PetofiUniversitaet BielefeldHakan Ringbop, Ed ., Style and Text ,  Sprak forlaget Skriptor AB, Stockholm, 377-390, 1975ISBN 91-7282-095-0The 'text-structure-world-structure theory' (TeSWeST) is an empirically motivated logic-oriented theory aiming at  the gramn~atical description of a text as a con~plex sign (intensionalsemantic description) and the assignment of the possible extensional interpretations to theintensional-semantically described text structure (extensional-semantic theory).
Theintensional-semantic and extensional-semantic descriptions are si~ch that they also contain thedescription of the pragmatic' aspects.
The grammatical component of the TeSWeST is agenerative transformational text grammar operating with linearly not fixed canonic basicstructur?
The formation rule system of this grammar consists of a o-called comn~unicative E rule (R ) expressed informally as: A communicative basis (TB ) is a communicativepredicate-complex: a communicator (C1) communicates (COMM) to a (potential)b * t  * 1 communisator/interpreter (C ) at a given tlme ( Q ) i n  a given place ( Q ) the message TB.
The elements of the norme implicit representation of the text intension are definienda i nthe lexicon and the elements of the normed explicir repxsentation of the text intension aredefinientes in  the lexicon.
The task of the extensional semantic component is to assignpossible extensional semantic interpretations to the possible i n  tensional semanticrepresentations.LINGUISTICS: METHODSLinguistics and Artificial IntelligencePetr SgallCentre of Numerical hiothemo~ics, Charles University, PraguePrague Bulletin of Moihemorical Linguisrics 24.9-33, 1975(1) Winograd's approach to language has forced a reeval.

(2 )  The useof lingi~istics descriptions in A1 provides a test f o r  l~nguis t ic  theories.
(3 )  Winograd's"imperative form" of  representing knowledge and semantics is more effective than one basedentirely on deductive logic.

M.

This is a major flawbecause extension of a database or integration of two existing-databases will then lead toeither reprogramming or inconsistency, or  both.
The flaw can be corrected by 'requiring thatall attributes are represented as a d a b  item in the (Ingical) schema.
In the CODASY L DDL1973, there are five places to optionally declare a record identifier and four of these fiveplaces are not in the rncord but in  the CODASYL set type.
Declaring record identifierstherefore results i n  fairly complex and non-orthogonal declarations.
This could be simplifiedby abondoning tjtese five places and by introducing a record identifier clause in the recordtype entry.
For integrity reasons i t  is necessary to require that at  least one record identifieris declared in every fecord type entry.
The previous two corrections will make is possible todesign a CODASY L set selection clause.

Thecorrected DDL is functionally equivalent, yet offers more data independence, is simpler andmore orthogonal.

The definiendum of one concept X1 may appear as a term in the definiens ofanother concept X2, thus permitt~ng recursive construction of defin~tions.
A machine basedarchive of soc~al  science concepts is proposed in which the core element of each entry will bea definition copied from relevant scholarly writings.
Each entry will :ilso contain: a) apossible translation of the definition into English and i n t o  fornial precise language b)specification of related terms and relevant theoretical context, c )  docu~neiitation of the sourceOF the difinition, d )  name of the contributor, e) anything else which secnls appropriate.Terms found i n  the new Thesaurus of the American Political Science Associ;l\ion will be r~sedfrom the beginning with later additions as needed.

1.92-60, 1975A fact-retrieval system consisting of  a data base, axiom set and inference system can deduceanswers to questions by combining a certain number of facts.
A predicate symbol followedby a series of constant terms or variable terms and its complement is a literal.
A literalwithout variable terms is a ground literal.
A. clause is a logical sum of literals.
Ahierarchical fact-retrieval system is stvdied by  viewing data as a set of  clauses, each of whichconsists of a ground literal.
Concrete fact-retrieval is assumed not to contain functionsymbols by limiting the objective.
Under such condition efficient procedures- are given for:1) retrieving constant terms by specifying predicate symbois and part of the constant termsand.
2) retrieving predicate syn~bols and the remaining constant terms by specifying part ofthe constant terms.
Futhermore, the number of comp:risons, which is the criterion for theretreival time in each procedure, is examined analytically and experimentally.DOCUMENTATION: RETRIEVALA Linguistic Approa~h to lnforrnation Retrieval--1Petr Syall, and Eva HajicovaCent re o/ Numerical Mat hemo fics,  Charles University, PragueInf irmation Storage and Retrieval 10:411-4 /7 ,  1974The.

2)the analysis, which takes, as its input, text and qlreslions i n  N L  mixed wi th  formal notations,and presents, as output, disambiguated translations in a language the brain can directly use,and 3) the synthesis, translating the answers delivered by the brain into the appropriate NL.The representation of the sentence on the ~ectuyranimaticnl level (the artifical language) hasthe form of a dependency graph, with the verb as its root.

The generative component is a context-free phrase structure anduses modifying, subs~itutional and selectional rules.
The right-hand side of the rules cannotcontain more than two non-terminal symbols.
I'here are recursive rules.
The order ofapplication is determined by the form of the rule i t se l f  (by a selection of non-terminalsynibols).
The rules are not distinguished as obligatory and optional ones.
The translation ofthe semantic representation to the graphemic level proceeds in two steps.
First, the semanticrepresentation i s  translated into a surface syntactic level, and this is then (secondly) translatedinto a morphemic representation.
The sequence of computer programs is based on the formalpattern of pushdown transducers.TRANSLATIONSome Computer Functions for Machine- Aided TranslationJ.

These rules are classified into severalhierarchies and there exist priorities in each hierarchy w h e l ~  rules are used.
Program andlinguistic data are separated as much as possible, so that a change of grammar does not  affectthe main program.
Therefore the program size becomes very small: about 1500 statements inassembler language.
The word dictionary contains SO00 head words and the grammar tablecontains about 900 rewriting rules.

Each opposition in the Rotinese rituallanguage is a dyadic set.
Some terms may appear in Inore t h a n  one dyadic set.
Tracingrelations among these semantic elements involves chains and cycles alorlg the edges o f  asymmetric graph.
The analysis of 5000 lines of verse has yielded a dictionary of the rituallanguage consisting of 1000+ dyadic sets over 1400 entries.
By concentratir~g on elementsincluded i n  5 or more dyads  (the frequency cutoff is somewhat  arbitrary) and with at  least 2links i n  common a core set of 21 entries is identified.
The core includes directionalcoordinates, words f o r  earth', 'water', 'rock , and 'tree" terms for plants and plant-parts, bodyparts, and a peculiar collection of verbs of position involving ideas of balance, border, ascent,and descent.

R.  GainesMun- M achines Systems Laboratory, Dtpartment oJ Electrical Engineering Science, Universityof Essex, Colchester, EnglandIEEE Transactions o/ Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 636-59, January 1976The prin,ciple of causality is fundamental to human thinking.
It has been observedexperimentally that causal thinking lends to complex hypothesis formation by humall subjectsattempting to solve comparatively simple problems involvirly acausal randon11 y generated.The assumption of causality in  modeling acausal systems leads to meaningless models thatcannot reflect any stochastic structure present.
This correspondence provides un automata-theoretic explanation of this phenomenon by analyzing the performance of an optimalmodeler observitlg tile behavior of a system and forming a minimal-stale model of it.SOCIAL-BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE: PSYCHOLOGYComputer-Determined Readability ProfilesDavid M.

Theamiddleground rules f o r  the major mode involve two formalized lan_eus~es,  S1, which has 11inference rules (corresponding to Schenker's prolongation techniques), and S2.

S1 governs dilyneor compositions (a l yne being o n e  musical voice) and  hasthree primitive axioms, while S2 governs irilvnear conipositions and contains an axiomstructure which relstes the systems S1 and S2.
The decision procedure provides one proof forany given theorem (i.e composition) rather than all possible proofs.
