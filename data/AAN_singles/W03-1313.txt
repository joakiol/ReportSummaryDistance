Despite the fact thatincreasingly complex linguistic informa-tion is being added to biomedical texts,no standard solutions have so far beenproposed for their encoding.
This pa-per describes a standardised XML tagset(DTD) for annotated biomedical corporaand other resources, which is based onthe Text Encoding Initiative GuidelinesP4, a general and parameterisable stan-dard for encoding language resources.
Weground the discussion in the encoding ofthe GENIA corpus, which currently con-tains 2,000 abstracts taken from the MED-LINE database, and has almost 100,000hand-annotated terms marked for seman-tic class from the accompanying ontol-ogy.
The paper introduces GENIA andTEI and implements a TEI parametrisa-tion and conversion for the GENIA cor-pus.
A number of aspects of biomedi-cal language are discussed, such as com-plex tokenisation, prevalence of contrac-tions and complex terms, and the linkageand encoding of ontologies.1 IntroductionWith the growing research on processing texts fromthe biomedical domain, the number of resources,esp.
corpora, is increasing rapidly.
Such corpora canbe heavily annotated, e.g., with meta-data, wordsand part-of-speech tags, named entities, phrases,terms, concepts, translation equivalents, etc.
Cor-pora are invaluable to the further development oftechnologies for utilising the information in biomed-ical texts, as they provide them with training andtesting data.
Given the value of such resources, itis important to ensure their reusability and increasetheir interchange potential ?
a step in this direc-tion is developing common encodings for biomedi-cal corpora.Standardisation of resource encoding practiceshas now, for some time, been in the forefront of at-tention.
Most of these advances are Web-driven, andinclude XML and related recommendations, such asXSLT, XML Schemas, XPointer, SAX, etc.
Thehigher level standards, of meta-data (RDF) and on-tologies (OWL) have been especially influential inencoding biomedical resources.
However, there re-mains the question how to best encode the structureof the text themselves, how to mark-up added lin-guistic analyses, and how to implement linkages be-tween the text and and further resources, such as lex-ica, thesauri and ontologies.
As discussed in (Ideand Brew, 2000), in order to qualify as a ?good?annotated corpus, its encoding should provide forreusabilty and extensibily.In this paper we build on previous work (Erjavecet al, 2003) and show how to develop a standard-ised encoding for biomedical corpora.
We baseour discussion on the case of the GENIA corpus(Ohta et al, 2002), which is originaly encoded inGPML, the GENIA Project Markup Language, anXML DTD.
We re-encode the corpus into a stan-dardised annotation scheme, based on the Text En-coding Initiative Guidelines P4 (Sperberg-McQueenand Burnard, 2002), and specify a constructive map-ping from the original DTD to the developed encod-ing via a XSLT transformation.One of the motivations for such an re-encodingis that TEI is well-designed and widely accepted ar-chitecture, which has been often used for annotatinglanguage corpora, and by porting to it, GENIA, andother projects, can gain new insights into possibleencoding practices and maybe make the corpus bet-ter suited for interchange.
As the transformation toTEI is fully automatic, there is also no need to aban-don the original markup format (in this case GPML),which, as it has been crafted specially for the corpus,provides a tighter encoding than can be possible withthe more general TEI.The paper thus proposes the creation of a prac-tical annotation scheme for linguistically annotated(biomedical) corpora, the conversion to which isautomatic and supports consistency checking andvalidation.
The paper also serves as a guide toparametrising TEI and draws attention to certain as-pects of biomedical corpora which are likely to faceall that wish to process such texts.The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 in-troduces the GENIA corpus; Section 3 introducesthe TEI, gives some pros and cons of using it,and the method of parametrising TEI for particularprojects; Section 4 discusses such a parametrisationfor biomedical corpora and explains the conversionof the GENIA corpus to TEI; Section 5 discussessome challenging properties of biomedical text an-notations; finally, Section 6 offers some conclusionsand directions for further work.2 The GENIA CorpusThe GENIA corpus (Ohta et al, 2002) is be-ing developed in the scope of the GENIA project,which seeks to develop information extraction tech-niques for scientific texts using NLP technol-ogy.
The corpus consists of semantically anno-tated published abstracts from the biomedical do-main.
The corpus is a collection of articles ex-tracted from the on-line MEDLINE abstracts (U.S.National Center for Biotechnology Information,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, PubMed database).Since the focus of the corpus is on biological re-actions concerning transcription factors in humanblood cells, articles were selected that contain theMeSH terms human, blood cell and transcriptionfactor.As usual for the field, the articles are composedlargely of structurally very complex technical terms,and are almost incomprehensible to a layperson.
Atypical heading e.g., reads IL-2 gene expression andNF-kappa B activation through CD28 requires reac-tive oxygen production by 5-lipoxygenase.The main value of the GENIA corpus comes fromits annotation: all the abstracts and their titles havebeen marked-up by two domain experts for bio-logically meaningful terms, and these terms havebeen semantically annotated with descriptors fromthe GENIA ontology.The GENIA ontology is a taxonomy of, currently,47 biologically relevant nominal categories, such asbody part, virus, or RNA domain or region; the tax-onomy has 35 terminal categories.The terms of the corpus are semantically de-fined as those sentence constituents that can be cate-gorised using the terminal categories from the ontol-ogy.
Syntactically such constituents are quite varied:they include qualifiers and can be recursive.The GENIA corpus is encoded in the GeniaProject Markup Language.
The GPML is an XMLDTD (Kim et al, 2001) where each article con-tains its MEDLINE ID, title and abstract.
The textsof the abstracts are segmented into sentences, andthese contain the constituents with their semanticclassification.
The GENIA ontology is provided to-gether with the GENIA corpus and is encoded inDAML+OIL (http://www.daml.org/ ), the standardXML-based ontology description language.
Thisstructure and its annotation will be further discussedbelow.A suite of supporting tools has been developed ortuned for the GENIA corpus and GPML: the termannotation is performed with the XMLMind editor;an XPath-based concordancer has been developedfor searching the corpus; and CSS stylesheets areavailable for browsing it.At the time of writing, the latest version of theGENIA corpus is 3.01, which has been releasedin April 2003.
It consists of 2,000 abstracts withover 400,000 words and more than 90,000 marked-up terms.
This version has not yet been marked-up with tokens or PoS information, although anearlier version (Genia-V3.0p) has been.
The GE-NIA corpus is available free of charge from the GE-NIA project homepage, at http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/.3 The Text Encoding InitiativeThe Text Encoding Initiative was established in1987 as a systematised attempt to develop a fullygeneral text encoding model and set of encodingconventions based upon it, suitable for processingand analysis of any type of text, in any language,and intended to serve the increasing range of ex-isting (and potential) applications and uses.
TheTEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding andInterchange were first published in April 1994 intwo substantial green volumes, known as TEI P3.In May 1999, a revised edition of TEI P3 wasproduced, correcting several typographic and othererrors.
In December 2000 the TEI Consortium(http://www.tei-c.org/ ) was set up to maintain anddevelop the TEI standard.
In 2002, the Consortiumannounced the availability of a major revision of TEIP3, the TEI P4 (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard,2002) the object of which is to provide equal sup-port for XML and SGML applications using the TEIscheme.
The revisions needed to make TEI P4 havebeen deliberately restricted to error correction only,with a view to ensuring that documents conformingto TEI P3 will not become illegal when processedwith TEI P4.
For GENIA, we are using the XML-compatible version of TEI P4.In producing P4, many possibilities for other,more fundamental changes have been identified.With the establishment of the TEI Council, it be-came possible to agree on a programme of work toenhance and modify the Guidelines more fundamen-tally over the coming years.
TEI P5 will be the nextfull revision of the Guidelines.
The work on P5 hasstarted, and the date of its appearance will likely bein 2004 and there are currently several TEI WorkingGroups addressing various parts of the Guidelinesthat need attention.More than 80 projects spanning over 30 languageshave so far made use of the TEI guidelines, pro-ducing diverse resources, e.g., text-critical editionsof classical works.
TEI has also been influentialin corpus encoding, where the best known exam-ple is probably the British National Corpus.
How-ever, while the TEI has been extensively used forannotating PoS tagged corpora, it been less popu-lar for encoding texts used by the the InformationRetrieval/Extraction community; here, a number ofother initiatives have taken the lead in encoding, say,ontologies or inter-document linking.3.1 Pros and cons of using TEIWhy, if a corpus is already encoded in XML usinga home-grown DTD, to re-encoded it in TEI at all?One reasons is certainly the validation aspect of theexercise: re-coding a corpus, or any other resource,reveals hidden (and in practice incorrect) assump-tions about its structure.
Re-coding to a standardrecommendation also forces the corpus designers toface issues which might have been overlooked in theoriginal design.There are also other advantages of using TEI asthe interchange format: (1) it is a wide-coverage,well-designed (modular and extensible), widely ac-cepted and well-maintained architecture; (2) it pro-vides extensive documentation, which comprises notonly the Guidelines but also papers and documen-tation (best practices) of various projects; (3) it of-fers community support via the tei-l public discus-sion list; (4) various TEI-dedicated software alreadyexists, and more is likely to become available; and(5) using it contributes to the adoption of open stan-dards and recommendations.However, using a very general recommendationwhich tries to cater for any possible situation bringswith it also several disadvantages:Tag abuse TEI might not have elements / attributeswith the exact meaning we require.
This re-sults in a tendency to misuse tags for purposesthey were not meant for; however, it is a caseof individual judgement to decide whether to(slightly) abuse a tag, or to implement a lo-cal extension to add the attribute or element re-quired.Tag bloat Being a general purpose recommenda-tion, TEI can ?
almost by definition ?
neverbe optimal for a specific application.
Thus acustom developed DTD will be leaner, haveless (redundant) tags and simpler content mod-els.TEI for humanities While the Guidelines cover avast range of text types and annotations, theyare maybe the least developed for ?high level?NLP applications or have failed to keep abreastof ?cutting-edge?
initiatives.
As will be seen,critical areas are the encoding of ontologies, oflexical databases and of feature structures.3.2 Building the TEI DTDThe TEI Guidelines (Sperberg-McQueen andBurnard, 2002) consist of the formal part, whichis a set of SGML/XML DTD fragments, and thedocumentation, which explains the rationale behindthe elements available in these fragments, as well asgiving overall information about the structure of theTEI.The formal SGML/XML part of TEI comes as aset of DTD fragments or tagsets.
A TEI DTD for aparticular application is then constructed by select-ing an appropriate combination of such tagsets.
TEIdistinguishes the following types of tagsets:Core tagset : standard components of the TEI mainDTD in all its forms; these are always includedwithout any special action by the encoder.Base tagsets : basic building blocks for specific texttypes; exactly one base must be selected by theencoder, unless one of the combined bases isused.Additional tagsets : extra tags useful for particularpurposes.
All additional tagsets are compatiblewith all bases and with each other; an encodermay therefore add them to the selected base inany combination desired.User defined tagsets : these extra tags give the pos-sibility of extending and overriding the defi-nitions provided in the TEI tagset.
Further-more, they give the option of explicitly includ-<!DOCTYPE teiCorpus.2 SYSTEM"http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/DTD/tei2.dtd"[<!ENTITY % TEI.XML "INCLUDE"><!ENTITY % TEI.prose "INCLUDE"><!ENTITY % TEI.linking "INCLUDE"><!ENTITY % TEI.analysis "INCLUDE"><!ENTITY % TEI.corpus "INCLUDE"><!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM?geniaex.ent?><!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM?geniaex.dtd?>]>Figure 1: The XML TEI prolog for GENIAing or ignoring (disallowing) each particular el-ement licensed by the chosen base and addi-tional tagsets.While a project-particular XML DTD can be con-structed by including and ignoring the TEI DTDfragments directly (as exemplified in Figure 1), it isalso possible to build ?

aone-file DTD with the help of the on-line TEI PizzaChef service, available from the TEI web site.4 Parametrising TEI for biomedicalcorporaIn previous work (Erjavec et al, 2003) we have al-ready proposed a TEI parametrisation of GENIAwhich was quite broad in its scope.
Because a num-ber of tagsets could prove useful in the long termthis parametrisation collected not only those that weconsidered necessary for the current version of GE-NIA, but also some that might prove of service in thefuture.
Furthermore, we supported the encoding ofboth version 2.1 and 3.0 of the corpus.
The resultingDTD was thus very generous in what kinds of data itcaters for.
To focus the discussion we, in the currentpaper, only address tagset that are immediately rele-vant to annotating biomedical texts.
In Figure 1 wedefine the XML DTD that can be used for encodingbiomedical resources, and that we used for GENIAV3.01.
The XML prolog given in this Figure definesthat ?teiCorpus.2?
is the root element of the corpus,that the external DTD resides at the given URL be-longing to the TEI Consortium, and that a numberof TEI modules, detailed below, are being used toparametrise the TEI to arrive at our particular DTD.4.1 TEI.XMLTEI P4 allows both standard SGML and XML en-codings.
Including the TEI.XML option indicatesthat the target DTD is to be expressed in XML.4.2 TEI.proseThe base tagset does not declare many elements butrather inherits all of the TEI core, which includes theTEI header, and text elements.
A TEI document willtypically have as its root element ?TEI.2?
which iscomposed of the ?teiHeader?, followed by the ?text?;c.f.
right hand side of Figure 2, but note that the rootelement from the TEI.corpus module is used for thecomplete corpus.The TEI header describes an encoded work so thatthe text (corpus) itself, its source, its encoding, andits revisions are all thoroughly documented.TEI.prose also contains elements and attributesfor describing text structure, e.g.
?div?
for text divi-sion, ?p?
for paragraph, ?head?
for text header, etc.The tagset is therefore useful for encoding the grossstructure of the corpus texts; for an illustration againsee Figure 2.4.3 TEI.linkingThis additional tagset provides mechanisms for link-ing, segmentation, and alignment.
The elementsprovided here enable links to be made e.g., betweenthe articles and their source URLs, or between con-cepts and their hypernyms.It should be noted that while the TEI treatmentof external pointers had been very influential, it wasovertaken and made obsolete by newer recommen-dations.
However, the TEI does have a WorkingGroup on Stand-Off Markup, XLink and XPointer,which should produce new TEI encoding recom-mendations for this area in 2003.4.4 TEI.analysisThis additional tagset is used for associating sim-ple linguistic analyses and interpretations with textelements.
It can be used to annotate words, ?w?,clauses, ?cl?, and sentences, ?s?
with dedicated tags,as well as arbitrary and possibly nested segmentswith the ?seg?.
Such elements can be, via at-tributes, associated with their analyses.
This tagsethas proved very popular for PoS-annotated corpora;for an illustration see Figure 3.4.5 TEI.corpusThis additional tagset introduces a new root element,?teiCorpus.2?, which comprises a (corpus) headerand a series of ?TEI.2?
elements.
The TEI.corpustagset alo extends the certain header elements toprovide more detailed descriptions of the corpus ma-terial.4.6 TEI.extensions.entThe file gives, for each element sanctioned by thechosen modules, whether we include or ignore it inour parametrisation.
While this is not strictly neces-sary (without any such specification, all the elementswould be included) we thought it wise to constrainthe content models somewhat, to reduce the bewil-dering variety of choices that the TEI otherwise of-fers.
Also, such an entity extension file gives thecomplete list of all the TEI elements that are allowed(and disallowed) in GENIA, which might prove use-ful for documentation purposes.4.7 TEI.extensions.dtdThis file specifies the changes we have made to TEIelements.
We have e.g., added the url attribute to?xptr?
and ?xref ?
and tagging attributes to word andpunctuation elements.4.8 Conversion of GPML to TEIBecause the source format of GENIA will remainthe simpler GPML, it is imperative to have an au-tomatic procedure for converting to the TEI inter-change format.
The translation process takes advan-tage of the fact that both the input and output areencoded in XML, which makes it possible to use theXSL Transformation Language, XSLT that defines astandard declarative specification of transformationsbetween XML documents.
There also exist a num-ber of free XSLT processors; we used Daniel Veil-lard?s xsltproc.The transformation is written as a XSLTstylesheet, which makes reference to two docu-ments: the GENIA ontology in TEI and the templatefor the corpus header.
The stylesheet then resolvesthe GPML encoded corpus into TEI.
The translationof the corpus is thus fully automatic, except for thetaxonomy, which was translated by hand.Figure 2 illustrates the top level structure of thecorpus, and how it differs between the GPML andTEI encodings.
The most noticeable difference is,apart from the renaming of elements, the additionof headers to the corpus and texts.
In the GENIA?teiHeader?
we give e.g., the name, address, avail-ability, sampling description, and, for each abstract?s?sourceDesc?, two ?xptr?s: the first gives the URL ofthe HTML article in the MEDLINE database, whilethe second is the URL of the article in the origi-nal XML.
It should be noted that we use a locallydefined url attribute for specifying the value of thepointer.5 Characteristics of biomedical textsIn this section we review some challenges thatbiomedical texts present to the processing and en-coding of linguistic information, and the manner oftheir encoding in our DTD.5.1 TokensTokenisation, i.e., the identification of words andpunctuation marks, is the lowest level of linguisticanalysis, yet is, in spite (or because) of this of con-siderable importance.
As all other levels of linguis-tic markup make direct or direct reference to the to-ken stream of the text, so if this is incorrect, errorswill propagate to all other annotations.It is also interesting to note that current annota-tion practice is more and more leaning toward stand-off markup, i.e., annotations that are separated fromthe primary data (text) and make reference to it onlyvia pointers.
However, it is beneficial to have somemarkup in the primary data to which it is possible torefer, and this markup is, almost exclusivelly, that oftokens; see e.g., (Freese et al, 2003).Version V1.1 of GENIA has been also annotatedwith LTG tools (Grover et al, 2002).
In short, thecorpus is tokenised, and then part-of-speech taggedwith two taggers, each one using a different tagset,and the nouns and verbs lemmatised.
Additionally,the deverbal nominalisations are assigned their ver-bal stems.The conversion to TEI is also able to handle thisadditional markup, by using the TEI.analysis mod-ule.
The word and punctuation tokens are encodedas ?w?
and ?c?
elements respectively, which are fur-ther marked with type and lemma and the locally de-fined c1, c2 and vstem.
An example of such markup<s><w c1="DT" c2="DB">All</w><c type="HYPH" c1=":" c2="-">-</c><w c1="VBZ" c2="JJ">trans</w><w c1="JJ" c2="JJ">retinoic</w><w lemma="acid" c1="NN" c2="NN1">acid</w><c type="BR" c1="(" c2="(">(</c><w lemma="Ra" c1="NN" c2="NP1">RA</w><c type="BR" c1=")" c2=")">)</c><w lemma="be" c1="VBZ" c2="VBZ">is</w><w c1="DT" c2="AT1">an</w><w c1="JJ" c2="JJ">important</w>...Figure 3: TEI encoding of annotated tokensis given in Figure 3.Given the high density of technical terms,biomedical texts are rife with various types of con-tractions, such as abbreviations, acronyms, prefixes,etc.
As seen already in Figure 3, one of themore problematic apects of tokenisaton are paren-theses.
Almost all tokenisers (e.g., the LT one, orthe UPENN tokeniser) take these as separate tokens,but many are in biomedical texts parts of terms.
So,out of almost 35,000 distinct terms that have beenmarked up in the GENIA corpus, over 1,700 con-tain parentheses.
Some examples: (+)-pentazocine,(3H)-E2 binding, (gamma(c))-like molecule.Correct tokenisation of the biomedical texts isthus a challenging tasks, and it is fair to say that,from a linguistic processing perspective, complextokenisation is one of the defining characteristics ofsuch corpora.5.2 TermsAnnotation of terms is a prerequisite for meaningfulprocessing of biomedical texts, yet it is often diffi-cult to decide what constitutes a term in a text, andhow to abstract away from local variations.
Biomed-ical texts are largerly (one could almost say excu-sivelly) composed of terms, and, as mentioned, thisbrings with it complex abbreviatory mechanisms.Even though TEI offers a ?term?
element, wechose, in line with the original GPML encoding, torather use the TEI.analysis clause (?cl?)
element toencode terms.
In GENIA, the terms have been hand-annotated, and marked up with concepts from theGENIA ontology; this was also the defining factorof term-hood, namely that the term could be linked<!DOCTYPE set SYSTEM "gpml.dtd"> <!DOCTYPE teiCorpus.2 SYSTEM "genia-tei.dtd"><set> <TEIcorpus.2><article> <teiHeader type="corpus"><articleinfo><bibliomisc> *Corpus_header*</teiHeader>*MEDLINE_ID* <TEI.2 id="*MEDLINE_ID*"></bibliomisc></articleinfo> <teiHeader type="text"><title> *Article_header*</teiHeader>*Title_of_article* <text><body></title> <div type="abstract"><abstract> <head>*Title_of_article*</head>*Abstract_of_article* <p>*Abstract_of_article*</p></abstract> </div></article> </body></text></TEI.2>*More_articles* *More_articles*</set> </TEIcorpus.2>Figure 2: The GPML and TEI structure of the corpusto a terminal concept of the GENIA ontology.In spite of the simple semantic definition, the syn-tactic structure of the terms in the corpus variesdramatically.
Biomedical terms are in some wayssimilar to named entities (names of people, orga-nizations, etc.)
but from the linguistic perspective,they are different in that named entities are mostlyproper nouns, while terms mostly contain commonnouns, and the two differ in their syntactic proper-ties.
Terms in the corpus can also be nested, wherecomplex terms are composed out of simpler ones,e.g., ?cl?
?cl?IL-2 gene?/cl?
transcription?/cl?.This nesting, and the reference to ontology con-cepts is often far from simple, as (partial) terms canappear in coordinated clauses involving ellipsis.
Forexample, ?CD2 and CD 25 receptors?
refers to twoterms, CD2 receptors and CD25 receptors, but onlythe latter actually appears in the text.In such cases by parsing the coordinationall the terms can be identified and annotated;the TEI encoding achieves this by specifyngthe propositional formula involving the par-ticipating concepts in the function attribute;for example, ?cl function=?
(AND G.tissueG.tissue)?
ana=?G.tissue???cl?normal?/cl?
and?cl?hypopigmented?/cl?
?cl?skin samples?/cl?
?/cl?.The ana attribute encodes the IDREF of the con-cept; currently, only same valued concepts are eitherconjoined or disjoined.The number of ?cl?
elements in the GENIA cor-pus is 96,582, among which 89,682 are simple termsand 1,583 are nested terms that are contain 3,431terms.
5,137 terms do not yet have the ana attributefor concept identification, so the total number ofontology-linked terms is 93,293.5.3 OntologiesOne of the more interesting questions in recodingGENIA in TEI was how to encode the ontology.
Theontology is in GENIA GPML encoded in a separatedocument, conforming to the OIL+DAML specifi-cation.
This, inter alia, means that that XML fileheavily relies on XML Namespaces and the RDFrecommendation.
An illustrative fragment is givenon the left side of Figure 4.Currently the GENIA ontology has a simple tree-like structure, i.e., it corresponds to a taxonomy,so we translated it to the TEI ?taxonomy?
element,which is contained in the ?classDecl?
of the header?encodingDesc?.
The TEI defines this elementas ?
[the classification declaration] contains one ormore taxonomies defining any classificatory codesused elsewhere in the text?, i.e., is exactly suited forour purposes.There are quite substantial differences betweenthe two encodings: the DAML+OIL models classinclusion with links, while the TEI does it as XMLelement inclusion.
This is certainly the simpler andmore robust solution, but requires that the ontol-ogy is a taxonomy, i.e., tree structured.
The sec-ond difference is in the status of the identifiers: inDAML+OIL they are general #CDATA links, whichneed a separate (XLink/XPointer) mechanisms fortheir resolution.
In TEI they are XML ID attributes,<daml:Class rdf:ID="source"></daml:Class> <taxonomy id="G.taxonomy"><daml:Class rdf:ID="natural"> <category id="G.source"><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#source"/> <catDesc>biological source</catDesc></daml:Class> <category id="G.natural"><daml:Class rdf:ID="organism"> <catDesc>natural</catDesc><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#natural"/> <category id="G.organism"></daml:Class> <catDesc>organism</catDesc><daml:Class rdf:ID="multi_cell"> <category id="G.multi_cell"><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#organism"/> <catDesc>multi-cellular</catDesc></daml:Class> </category>...
...Figure 4: The GENIA DAML+OIL and TEI ontologyand can rely on the XML parser to resolve them.While this is a simpler solution, it does supportdocument-internal reference only.6 ConclusionsThe paper proposed an XML paramterisation of TEIP4 developed for linguistically annotated biomedi-cal corpora, and applied it to the GENIA corpus.The conversion from the Genia Project Markup Lan-guage to this encoding has been implemented inXSLT and both the TEI-conformant parametrisation(TEI extension file and one-file DTD) and the XSLTstylesheets are, together with a report documentingthem, available at http://nl.ijs.si/et/genia/, while theGENIA corpus is freely available from http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/.The paper gave a survey of the TEI modules thatcan be useful for encoding a wide variety of linguis-tically annotated corpora.
This contribution, it ishoped, can thus serve as a blueprint for parametris-ing TEI for diverse corpus resources.Further work involves the inclusion of otherknowledge sources into the corpus, say of Medi-cal Subject Headings (MeSH), Unified Medical Lan-guage System (UMLS), International Classificationof Disease (ICD), etc.
The place of these annota-tions in the corpus will have to be considered, andtheir linking to the existing information determined.ReferencesTomaz?
