Interactive Auditory DemonstrationsMartin CookeSpeech and Hearing ResearchDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of SheffieldRegent Court211 Portobello StreetSheffield S 1 4DPUKm.cooke@dcs.shef.ac.ukAbstractThe subject matter of speech and hearing ispacked full of phenomena and processes whichlend themselves toor require auditory demon-stration.
In the past, this has been achievedthrough passive media such as tape or CD (e.g.Houtsma et ai, 1987; Bregman & Ahad, 1995).The advent of languages such as MATLABwhich suppor!s ound handling, modern inter-face elements and powerful signal processingroutines, coupled with the availability of fastprocessors and ubiquitous oundcards allowstbr a more interactive style of demonstration.A significant effort is now underway in thespeech and hearing community to exploit hesefavourable conditions (see the MATISSE pro-ceedings (1999), for instance).Excitingly, it is now possible to allow explora-tory access to part or all of the parameter spaceunderlying each phenomenon.
Over the past 18months, more than 20 interactive auditorydemonstrations have been produced at Shef-field as part of an ongoing project o provideteaching material for the diverse disciplineswhich contribute to speech and hearing.
Manyof the demonstrations are suitable for under-graduate courses, while others encode phe-nomena which are primarily of interest toresearchers.The motivation for and design ethos behindthis project has been described previously inCooke & Brown (1999) and Wrigley, Cooke &Brown (1999).
In this extended abstract, agal-lery of screenshots which focus on the auditory(as opposed to speech) demonstrations is pro-vided.
The aim is to show the breadth of whatis possible in a relatively short time and toencourage others to produce similar tools.The demonstrations can be freely downloadedvia http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/-martin.AcknowledgementsDemonstrations described here were pro-grammed by Guy Brown, Martin Cooke andStuart Wrigley (Sheffield, UK) and Dan Ellis(ICSI, Berkeley, USA).
