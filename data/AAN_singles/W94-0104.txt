Study and Implementation of Combined Techniques forAutomatic Extraction of TerminologyBdatrice DailleTALANAUniversity Paris 7Case 70032, Place JussieuF-75251 Paris Cedex 05Franceda i l le@l ingu is t ,  j ussieu, frAbstractThis paper presents an original method and its imple-mentation to extract terminology from corpora by com-bining linguistic filters and statistical methods.
Start-ing from a linguistic study of the terms of telecommu-nication domain, we designed a number of filters whichenable us to obtain a first selection of sequences thatmay be considered as terms.
Various statistical scoresare applied to this selection and results are evaluated.This method has been applied to French and to English,but this paper deals only with French.Introduct ionA terminology bank contains the vocabulary of a tech-nical domain: terms, which refer to its concepts.Building a terminological bank requires a lot of timeand both linguistic and technical knowledge.
The is-sue, at stake, is the automatic extraction of termi-nology of a specific domain from a corpus.
Cur-rent research on extracting terminology uses either lin-guistic specifications or statistical approaches.
Con-cerning the former, \[Bouriganlt, 1992\] has proposeda program which extracts automatically from a cor-pus sequences of lexical units whose morphosyntaxcharacterizes maximal technical noun phrases.
Thislist of sequences is given to a terminologist to bechecked.
For the latter, several works (\[Lafon, 1984\],\[Church and Hanks, 1990\], \[Calzolari and Bindi, 1990\],\[Smadja and McKeown, 1990\]) have shown that statis-tical scores are useful to extract collocations from cor-pora.
The main problem with one or the other approachis the "noise": indeed, morphosyntactic criteria are notsufficient o isolate terms, and collocations extractedthanks to statistical methods belong to various types ofassociations: functional, semantical, thematical or un-characterizable ones.Our goal is to use statistical scores for extracting tech-nical compounds only and to forget about the othertypes of collocations.
We proceed in two steps: first,apply a linguistic filter which selects candidates fromthe corpus; then, apply statistical scores to rank thesecandidates and select the scores which fit our purpos(~best, in other words scores that concentrate their highvalues to terms and their low values to co-occurrcuccswhich are not terms.Linguistic DataIn a first part, we therefore study the linguistic specifi-cations on the nature of terms in the technical domainof telecommunications for French.
Then, taking into ac-count these linguistics results, we present he methodand the program which extracts andcounts the candi-date terms.L ingu is t i c  spec i f i ca t ionsTerms are mainly multi-word units of nominal type thatcould be characterized by a range of morphological, syn-tactic or semantic properties.
The main property ofnominal terms is the morphosyntactic one: its str,c-ture belongs to well-known morphosyntactic structuressuch asN ADJ, N1 de N2, etc.
that have been studied by\[Mathieu-Colas, 1988\] for French.
Some graphic indica-tions (hyphen), morphological indications (restrictiousin flexion) and syntactic ones (absence of determiners)could also be good clues that a noun phrase is a term.We have also employed a semantic riteria: the criterionof unique referent.
A term refers to an unique and uni-versal concept.
However, it is not obvious to apply thiscriterion to a technical domain where we are not expert.So, we have interpreted the criterion of unique referentby the one of unique translation.
A French term is al-ways identically translated, mostly by a compound ora simple noun in English.
We have extracted mare,allyterms following these criteria from our bilingual corpus,29available in French and English, the Satellite Commu-nication Handbook (SCH) containing 200 000 words in,,ach language.
Then, we have classified terms followingtheir lengths; the length of a term is defined as the num-b,,r of main items it contains.
1 From this classification,it at)p('ars that terms of length 2 are by far the mostf rcquenl ,  ones .
As statistical methods ask for a goodrcl)rcsentatiou in number of the samples, we decided toextract in a first round only terms of length 2 that wewill call base-term which matched a list of previouslydetermined patterns:N ADJ station terrienne (Earth station)NI de (D~T) N2 zone de eouverture (coverage zone)Nt h (DET) N2 rdflecteur d grille (grid reflector)Nt PREP N~ liaison par satellite (satellite link)Ni N2 diode tunnel (tunnel diode)Of course, terms exist whose length is greater than 2.But the majority of terms of length greater than 2 arecreated recursively from base-terms.
We have distin-guished three operations that lead to a term of length 3from a term of length 1 or 2: "overcomposition", modifi-catio,, and coordination.
We illustrate now these opera-tions with a few examples where the base-terms appearinside brackets:I. Ovcrcompos l t ionTwo kinds of overcomposition have been pointed out:ow'rcomposition by juxtaposition and overcomposi-tion by substitution.
(a) .I u xtapositionA term obtained by juxtaposition is built with atleast one base-term whose structure will not be al-tered.
The example below illustrate the juxtaposi-tion of a base-term and a simple noun:Ni PREPI \[N2 PREP2 N3\]modulation par \[d~placement de phase\] (\[phaseshift,\] keying)(b) Substitution(living a base-term, one of its main item is sub-stituted by a base-term whose head is this mainitem.
For example, in the N1 PREP1 N2 structure,N1 is subtituted by a base-term of N1 PREP2 N3structure to create a term of N1 PREPs N3 PREP1N~ structure:rdscau d satellites + rgseau de transit ~ rgseau detransit h satellites (satellite transit network).We notice in the above example that the structureof r~seau h satellites (satellite network) is altered.2.
Mod i f i ca t ionModifiers that could generate a new term from a base-te rm appear either inside or after it.
(a) Insertion of modifiersAdjectives and adverbs are the current modifiers' Main items are nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
NeitherI,r,'l~osil.ions nor  deterndners are main itemsthat could be inserted inside a base-term structure:adjectives in the N1 PREP (DI~T) N2 structure andadverbs in the N ADJ one:liaisons mult ip les  par satellite (multiple \[satellitelinks\])rdseaux enti /~rement umdriques (all \[digital net-works\])(b) Post-modifieationAdjectives and adverbial prepositionnal phrase ofPREP ADJ N are the main modifiers that lead to thecreation of new terms: post-adjectives can modifyany kind of base-terms; for example, \[station ter-rienne\] brouilleuse (interfering \[earth(-)station\]).Adverbial prepositional phrases modify either sim-ple nouns or base-terms2: amplificateur(s) \[dfaible bruit\] (flow noise\] amplifier(s)), \[interface(s)usager-rgseau\] \[~i usage multiple\] (\[multipurpose\]\[user-network interface(s)\]).3.
Coord inat ionCoordination is a rather complex syntactic phe-nomenon (term coordination have been studied in\[Jacquemin, 1991\]) and seldom generates new terms.Let us examine a rare example of a term of length 3obtained by coordination :N1 de Ns + N2 de N3 --+ N1 et N~ de N3assemblage de paquet + dgsassemblage d  paquets --rassemblage t dgsassemblage de paquets (packet as-sembly/desassembly)It is difficult to determine whether a modified or over-composed base-term is or is not a term.
Take for ex-ample bande latgrale unique (single side-band): bandelatgrale (side-band} is a base-term of structure N ADJand unique (single) a very common post-modifier ad-jective in French.
The fact that bande latgrale uniqueis a term is indicated by the presence of the abbrevia-tion BLU (SSB).
As abbreviations are not introducedfor all terms, the right attitude is surely to extract firstbase-terms, i.e.
bande latgrale (side-band}.
Once youhave base-terms, you can easily extract from the corpusterms of length greater than 2, at least post-modifiedbase-terms and overcomposed base-terms by juxtaposi-tion.
But, even if we have decided to extract only base-terms (length 2), we have to take into account theirvariations, at least some of them.
Variants of base-terms are classified under the following categories:1.
Graphical and orthographic variantsBy graphical variants, we mean either the use or notof capitalized letters (Service national or service na-tional ((D/cl)omestic service), or the presence or notof an hyphen inside the Ni N2 structure (mode pa-quet or mode.paquet (packet(-)mode) ).Orthographic variants concern N1 PREP N2 struc-ture.
For this structure, the number of N2 is gen-erally fixed, either singular or plural.
However, we2In this case, the length of the term is equal to 430have encountered some exceptions: rdseau(x) ~ satel-lite, rgseaux(x) fi satellites (satellite network(s)).2.
Morphosyntactic variantsMorphosyntactic variants refer to the presence ornot of an article before the N2 in the N1 PREP N~structure: ligne d'abonng, lignes de l'abonng (sub-scriber lines), to the optional character of the prepo-sition: tension hdlice, tension d'hdlice (helix voltage)and to synonymy relation between two base-termsof different structures: for example N ADJ and N1 dN2: rgseau commutd, rgseau d commutation (switchednetwork)3.
Elliptical variantsA base-term of length 2 could be called up by anelliptic form: for example: ddbit which is used insteadof dgbit binaire (bit rate).After this linguistic investigation, we decide to concen-trate on terms of length 2 (base-terms) which seemby far the most frequent ones.
Moreover, the major-ity of terms whose length is greater than 2 are builtfrom base-terms.
A statistical approach requires a goodsampling that base-terms provide.
To filter base-termsfrom the corpus, we use their morphosyntaetic struc-tures.
For this task, we need a tagged corpus whereeach item comes with its part-of-speech and its lemma.The part-of-speech is used to filter and the lemma toobtain an optimal sampling.
We have use the stochas-tic tagger and the lemmatizer of the Scientific Center ofIBM-France developed by the speech recognition team(\[Ddrouault, 1985\] and \[E1-B~ze, 19931).L ingu is t i c  f i l te rsWe now face a choice: we can either isolate collocationsusing statistics and then apply linguistic filters, or ap-ply linguistic filters and then statistics.
It is the latterstrategy that has been adopted: indeed, the former asksfor the use of a window of an arbitrary size; if you takea small window size, you will miss a lot of occurrences,mainly morphosyntactic variants, base-terms modifiedby an inserted modifier, very frequent in French, andcoordinated base-terms; if you take a longer one, youwill obtain occurrences that do not refer to the sameconceptual entity, a lot of ill-formed sequences which donot characterizes terms, and moreover wrong frequencycounts as several short sequences are masked by onlyone long sequence.
Using first linguistic filters based onpart-of-speech tags appears as the best solution.
More-over, as patterns that characterizes base-terms can bedescribed by regular expressions, the use of finite au-tomata seems a natural way to extract and count theoccurrences of the candidate base-terms.The frequency counts of the occurrences of the candi-date terms are crucial as they are the parameters ofthe statistical scores.
A wrong frequency count im-plies wrong or not relevant values of statistical scores.The objective is to optimize the count of base-termsoccurrences and to minimize the count of incorrect oc-currences.
Graphical, orthographic and xnorpho.sy.t;w-tic variants of base-terms (except synomymic varbmt,~)are taken into account as well as some syntactic vari-ations that affect the base-terms structure: coordhm-tion and insertion of modifiers.
Coordimttion of twobase-terms rarely leads to the creation of a new tcrntof length greater than 2, so it is reasonable to thi.kthat the sequence gquipements de modulation et d,' d, ~-modulation (modulation and demodulation cqaipmvnls)is equivalent to the sequence gquipement ,h. modul.tt,met dquipement de d~modulation (modulation equipmentand demodulation equipment).
Insertion of moditicrs in-side a base-term structure does not raise problem, ex-pect when this modifier is an adjective inserted inside aN1 PREP N2 structure.
Let us examine the sequence an-tenne parabolique de rdception (parabolic receiving an-tenna), this sequence could be a term of length 3 (ob-tained either by over-composition r by modification)or a modified base-term, namely antenne de rgceptionmodified by the inserted adjective parabolique.
On onehand, we don't want to extract erms of length greaterthan 2, but on the other hand, it is not possible toignore adjective insertion.
So, we have chosen to ac-cept insertion of adjective inside N1 PREP N~ structure.This choice implies the extraction of terms of length 3of N 1 ADJ PREP N2 structure that are considered asterms of length 2.
However, such cases are rare andthe majority of N1 ADJ PREP N2 sequences refer to aN1 PREP N2 base-term odified by an adjective.Each occurrence of a base-terms i counted equally; weconsider that there is equiprobability of the term ap-pearance in the corpus.
The occurrences of morpholog-ical sequences which characterize base-terms are classi-fied under pairs: a pair is composed of two main itemsin a fixed order and collects all the sequences wherethe two lemmas of the pair appear in one of the al-lowed morphosyntactic patterns; for example, the se-quences: ligne d'abonnd, lignes de l'abonnd (subscriberlines), ligne numgrique d'abonnd (digital subscriber line)are each one occurrence of the pair (llgne, abonn~).If we have the coordinated sequence lignes et servicesd'abonnd (subscriber lines and services), we count oneoccurrence for the pair (ligne, abonnd) and one occur-fence for the pair (service, abonnd).
Our program scansthe corpus and counts and extracts collocations whosesyntax characterizes base-terms.
Under each pair, wefind all the different occurrences found with their fre-quencies and their location in the corpus (file, sentence,item).
This program runs fast: for example, it took 2minutes to extract 8 000 pairs from our corpu s SCH(200 000 words) for the structure Nx de (DI,:T) N~ on aSparc station ELC (SS1) under Sun-Os Release 4. !
.3.Now that we have obtained a set of pairs, each pair rep-resenting a candidate term, we apply statistical scoresin order to distinguish terms from non-terms among thecandidates.31Rationumber of goodpairs dividedby total numberof an equivalenceclass (50 pairs)10IS,1IIp F2 3 ... 30  223Pairs sorted accordin to f r __g .

_Figure 1: Frequency histogramLexical StatisticsThe problem to solve now is to discover which sta-tistical score is the best to isolate terms among ourlist of Candidates.
So, we compute several measures:frequencies, association criteria, Shannon diversity anddistance scores.
All these measures could not be usedfor the same purpose: frequencies are the parametersof the association criteria, association criteria proposea conceptual sort of the couples, and Shannon diversityan<i distance measures are not discriminatory scores butprovide other types of informations.F requenc ies  and  Assoc ia t ion  c r i te r iaFrom a statistical point of view, the two lemmas of apair could be considered as two qualitative variableswhose link has to be tested.
A contingency table isdefined for each pair (Li, Lj):I II Lj I Lj, with j '  # jLi, with i' ?
i c dwhere:a stands for the frequency of pairs involving both Liand Lj,b stands for the frequency of pairs involving Li and Lj,,c stands for tile frequency of pairs involving Li, and Lj,d stands for the frequency of pairs involving Li, andThe statistical literature proposes many scores whichcan be used to test the strength of the bond be-tween the two variables of a contingency table.
Someare well-known such as the association ratio, closeto the concept of mutual information, introduced by\[Church and Hanks, 1990\]:aIM = log~ (a+b)Ca+c) (1)the O 2 coefficient introduced by\[Gale and Church, 1991\]:02 = (ad-  be) 2(a + b)(a + c)(b + c)(b + d) (2)or the Loglike coefficient introduced by\[Dunning, 1993\]:Loglike = a loga + blogb + clogc + dlogd- (  a + b)log(a + b) - ( a + c) logCa -I- c)-(b + d) logCb + d) - ( c + d) logCc + d)+(a+b+c+d) logCa+b+c+d)  (3)A property of these scores is that their values increasewith the strength of the bond of the lemmas.
We havetried out several scores (more than ten) including IM,?
2 and Loglike and we have sorted the pairs followingthe score value.
Each score proposes a conceptual sortof the pairs.
This sort, however, could put at the topof the list compounds that belong to general anguagerather than to the telecommunication domain.
As wewant to obtain a list of telecommunication terms, it is32Pairs of Ni (PREP (VET)) N2structure(largeur, bande)(tempt6rature, bruit)(bande, base)(amplificateur, puissance)(temps, propagation)(r~glement, radiocommunication)(produit, intermodulation)(taux, erreur)(miss, ~uvre)(tdldcommunication, satellite)(bilan, liaison)The most frequent pair sequencelargeur de bands (197)(bandwidth)tempdrature de bruit (110)(noise temperature)bande de base (142)(baseband)amplifieateur(s) depuissance (137)(power amplifier)temps de propagation (93)(propagation delay)r~glement des radiocommunications (60)(radio regulation)produit(s) d'intermodulation (61)( intermodulation product)taux d' erreur (70)(error ratio)raise en omvre (47)(implementation)t~l~communication(s) par satellite (88)(satellite communication(s) )bilanfs) de liaison (37)(link budget)Figure 2: Topmost pairsI Logl Nbc IM1328 223 5.74777 126 6.18745 145 5.52728 137 5.66612 94 6.69521 60 8.14458 61 7.45420 70 6.35355 47 7.49!353 99 4.09344 55 6.42essential to evaluate the correlation between the scorevalues and the pairs and to find out which scores arethe best to extract erminology.
Therefore, we comparethe values obtained for each score to a reference list ofthe domain.
We have used the terminology data bankof the EEC, telecommunication section, which has beenelaborated by experts.
This evaluation has been donefor 2 200 French pairs3of N1 de (DEW) N 2 structure x-tracted from our corpus SCH (200 000 words).
Eachscore provides as a result a list where the candidatesare sorted following the score value.
We have definedequivalence classes which generally collect 50 succes-sive pairs of the list.
The results of a score are rep-resented graphically thanks to an histogram in whichthe x-axis represents the pairs sorted according to thescore value, and y-axis the ratio of the number of pairsbelonging to the reference list divided by the numberof pairs per equivalence class, i.e.
generally 50 pairs.
Ifall the pairs of an equivalence class belong to the ref-erence list, we obtain the maximum ratio of 1; if noneof the pairs appear in the reference list, the minimumratio of 0 is reached.
The ideal score should assign itshigh values (resp.
low) to good (resp.
bad) pairs, i.e.candidates which belong (resp.
which don't belong) tothe reference list.
In other words, the histogram of theideal score should assign to equivalence classes contain-ing the high values (resp.
low values) of the score a ratioclose to 1 (resp.
0).
We are not going to present hereall the histograms obtained (see \[Daille, 1994\]).
All of3Only pairs which appear at least twice in the corpushave been retained.them show a general growing trend that confirm thatthe score values increase with the strength of the bondof the \]emma.
However, the growth is more or less clear,with more or less sharp variations.
The most beautiSdhistogram is the simple frequency of the pair (see Fig-ure 1).
This histogram shows that more frequent ilepair is, the more likely the pair is a term.
Frequency isthe most significant score to detect erms of a technicaldomain.
This results contradicts numerous results oflexical resources, which claim that association criteriaare more significant than frequency: for example, all themost frequent pairs whose terminological status is un-doubted share low values of association ratio (formula1) as for example rdseau d satellites (satellite network}IM=2.57, liaison par satellite (satellite link) IM=2.72,circuit tglgphonique (telephone circuit )IM=3.32, sta-tion spatiale (space station) IM=l.17 etc.
Tile remain-ing problem with the sort proposed by frequency is thatit integrates very quickly bad candidates, i.e.
pairswhich are not terms.
So, we have preferred to elect theLoglike coefficient (formula 3) the best score.
Indeed,Loglike coefficient which is a real statistical test, takesinto account he pair frequency but accepts very littlenoise for high values.
To give an element of comparison,the first bad candidate with frequency for the generalpattern N1 (PREP (DEW)) N2 is the pair (cas, transmis-sion) which appears in 56th place; this pair, which isalso the first bad candidate with Loglike, appears in176th place.
We give in figure 2 the topmost 11 frenchpairs sorted by the Loglike coefficient (Logl) (Nbc isthe number of the pair occurrences and IM the value of33association ratio).D ivers i tyDiversity has been introduced by \[Shannon, 1948\] andchara,~terizes the marginal distribution of the lemma ofa pair through the range of pairs.
Its computation usesa contingency table of length n: we give below as an,xample the contingency table which is associated tothe pairs of N ADJ structure:progressi\] \] porteur L.:2:._l\] Total .~corm't 9 0The line counts nbi., which are found in the last column,represent the distribution of the adjectives with regardsto a given noun.
The columns counts nb.j, which arefound on the last line, represent the distribution of the.ouns with regards to a given adjective.
These distri-butio,s arc called "marginal distributions" of the nounsand the adjectives for the N ADJ structure.
Diversityis computed for each lemma appearing in a pair, usingthe fornmla:Hi = nbi.
log hi.
- ~ nblj log nblj (4)j=lilj = nb.j log n4 - ~ nbo log nblji=1For example, using the contingency table of the N ^vJstructure above, diversity of the noun onde is equal to:H{onde..) = nb(onde,.)

.
)We note H1, diversity of the first lemma of a pair and!t2 diversity of the second lemma.
We take into accountthe diversity normalized by the number of occurrencesof the pairs:Hihi -- (5)ni jHj  hj = - -ni jThe normalized iversities hi and h2 are defined fromIll and H2.
'l'h~, normalized iversity provides interesting informa-tions about the distribution of the pair lemmas in theset of pairs.
A lemma with a high diversity means thatit appears in several pairs in equal proportion; con-w'rscly, a lemma which appear only in one pair ownsa zero diversity (minimal value) and this, whatever isthe frequency of the pair.
High values of hi applied tothe pairs of N ^DJ structure characterizes nouns thatcould l)c seen as key-words of the domain: r#sean (net-work), s~gnal, antenne (antenna), satellite.
Conversely,high values of h~ applied to the pairs of N ADJ structurecharacterizes adjectives which do not take part to base-MWVs as n&essaire (necessary), suivant (following),important, different (various), tel (such), etc.
The pairswith a zero diversity on one of their lemma receive highvalues of association ratio and other association crite-ria and a non-definite value of Loglike coefficient.
How-ever, the diversity is more precise because it indicatesif the two lemmas appear only together as for (ocEan,indien) (indian ocean) (Hl=hl=H2=h2=0), or if not,which of the two lemmas appear only with the other, asfor (r&,eau, maill~) (mesh network) (H2=hz=0), wherethe adjective mailM apl:wears only with rdseau or for(?odeur, id&al) (ideal coder) (Hi=hi=0) where the nouncodeur appears only with the adjective ideal.
Otherexamples are: Oh, salomon) (solomon island), (h~lium,gazeux) (helium gas), (suppresscur, bzho) (echo suppres-sor).
These pairs collects many frozen compounds andcollocations of the current language.
In future work,we will investigate how to incorporate the nice resultsprovided by diversity into an automatic extraction al-gorithm.D is tance  MeasuresFrench base-terms often accept modifications of theirinternal structure as it has been demonstrated previ-ously.
Each time, an occurrence of a pair is extractedand counted, two distances are computed: the num-ber of items Dist and the number of main items MDistwhich occur between the two lemmas.
Then, for eachcouple, the mean and the variance of the number ofitems and main items are computed.
The variance for-mula is:v(x )  ==The distance measures bring interesting informationswhich concern the morphosyntactic variations of thebase-terms, but they don't allow to take a decision uponthe status of term or non-term of a candidate.
A pairwhich has no distance variation, whatever is the dis-tance, is or is not a term; we give now some examplesof pairs which have no distance variations and whichare not terms: paire de signal (a pair of signaO, typed'antenne (a type off antenna), organigramme de la fig-ure (diagram of the figure), etc.
We illustrate belowhow the distance measures allow to attribute to a pairits elementary type automatically, for example, eitherN1 N2, N1 PREP N2, N1 PREP DET N2, or Ni ADJ PREP(VET) N2 for the general N1 (PREP (VET)) N2 structure.1.

Starting from a first selection of lemmapairs representing candidate terms from a morphosyn-tactic point of view, we have applied and evaluated sev-eral statistical scores.
Results were surprising: mostassociation criteria (for example, mutual association)didn't give good results contrary to frequency.
This badbehavior of the association criteria could be explainedby the introduction of linguistic filters.
We can no-tice anyway that frequency characterizes undoubtedlyterms, contrary to association criteria which select intheir high values frozen compounds belonging to gen-eral language.
However, we preferred to elect the Log-like criterion rather than frequency as the best score.This latter takes into account frequency of the pairsbut provide a conceptual sort of high accuracy.
Oursystem which uses finite automata llows to increasethe results of the extraction of lexical resources and todemonstrate he efficiency to incorporate linguistics ina statistic system.
