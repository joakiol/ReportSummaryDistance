This taskpresents a number of opportunities for the au-tomatic support of manual curation efforts.However, the sheer number of different typesof protein modifications is a daunting chal-lenge for automatic extraction that has so farnot been met in full, with most studies focus-ing on single modifications or a few prominentones.
In this work, aim to meet this challenge:we analyse protein modification types throughontologies, databases, and literature and intro-duce a corpus of 360 abstracts manually anno-tated in the BioNLP Shared Task event repre-sentation for over 4500 mentions of proteinsand 1000 statements of modification events ofnearly 40 different types.
We argue that to-gether with existing resources, this corpus pro-vides sufficient coverage of modification typesto make effectively exhaustive extraction ofprotein modifications from text feasible.1 IntroductionIn the decade following the sequencing of the hu-man genome, the critical role of protein modifica-tions in establishing the full set of protein functionsfrom forms transcribed from the fixed DNA is in-creasingly appreciated, reflected in the rise of pro-teomics as an extension and complement to geneticsin efforts to understand gene and protein functions.The mapping of the space of modifications of spe-cific proteins is a formidable undertaking: the num-ber of known types of post-translational modifica-tions (PTMs) is as high as 300 (Witze et al, 2007)with new types identified regularly (e.g.
(Brennanand Barford, 2009)), and the number of specificmolecular variants of proteins in cells may be severalorders of magnitude larger than that encoded in thegenome; up to millions for humans (Walsh, 2006).Automatic extraction of protein modifications fromthe massive literature on the topic could contributesignificantly to addressing these challenges.Biomedical information extraction (IE) has ad-vanced substantially in recent years, shifting fromthe detection of simple binary associations suchas protein-protein interactions toward resources andmethods for the extraction of multiple types of struc-tured associations of varying numbers participants inspecific roles.
These IE approaches are frequentlytermed event extraction (Ananiadou et al, 2010).While protein modifications have been consideredin numerous IE studies in the domain (e.g.
(Fried-man et al, 2001; Rzhetsky et al, 2004; Hu et al,2005; Narayanaswamy et al, 2005; Saric et al,2006; Yuan et al, 2006; Lee et al, 2008; Ohta etal., 2010), event extraction efforts have brought in-creased focus also on the extraction of protein modi-fications: in the BioNLP Shared Task series that haspopularized event extraction, the 2009 shared task(Kim et al, 2009) involved the extraction of nineevent types including one PTM, and in the 2011follow-up event (Kim et al, 2011) the Epigenet-ics and Post-translational modifications (EPI) task(Ohta et al, 2011) targeted six PTM types, their re-114verse reactions, and statements regarding their catal-ysis.
The results of these tasks were promising, sug-gesting that the single PTM type could be extractedat over 80% F-score (Buyko et al, 2009) and thecore arguments of the larger set at nearly 70% F-score (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011).The increasing availability of systems capable ofdetailed IE for protein modifications, their high per-formance also for multiple modifications types, anddemonstrations of the scalability of the technologyto the full scale of the literature (Bjo?rne et al, 2010)are highly encouraging for automatic extraction ofprotein modifications.
However, previous effortshave been restricted by the relatively narrow scopeof targeted modification types.
In the present study,we seek to address the task in full by identifyingall modifications of substantial biological signifi-cance and creating an annotated resource with effec-tively complete type-level coverage.
We addition-ally present preliminary extraction results to assessthe difficulty of exhaustive modification extraction.2 Event representationTo be able to benefit from the substantial number ofexisting resources and systems for event extraction,we apply the event representation of the BioNLPShared Task (ST) for annotating protein modifica-tions.
Specifically, we directly extend the approachof the BioNLP ST 2011 EPI task (Ohta et al, 2011).In brief, in the applied representation, each eventis marked as being expressed by a specific span oftext (the event trigger) and assigned a type from afixed ontology defining event types.
Events can takea conceptually open-ended number of participants,each of which is similarly bound to a specific tex-tual expression and marked as participating in theevent in a specific role.
In this work, we apply threeroles: Theme identifies the entity or event that is af-fected by the event (e.g.
the protein that is modified),Cause its cause, and Site specifies a specific part onthe Theme participant that is affected, i.e.
the mod-ification site or region.
Further, events are primaryobjects of annotation and can thus in turn be par-ticipants in other events as well as being marked ase.g.
explicitly negated (?is not phosphorylated?)
orstated speculatively (?may be phosphorylated?).
Anevent annotation example is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Illustration of the event representation.
Anevent of type ADP-RIBOSYLATION (expressed throughthe text ?ADP-ribosylation?)
with a PROTEIN (?P2X7?
)participant in the Theme role is in turn the Theme of aCATALYSIS event with another PROTEIN (?ART2?)
as itsCause.3 Protein ModificationsWe next present our selection of protein modifica-tion types relevant to event annotation and an ex-tended analysis of their relative prominence.3.1 Protein Modifications in OntologiesFor mapping and structuring the space of proteinmodification concepts, we primarily build on thecommunity-standard Gene Ontology (GO) (Ash-burner et al, 2000).
GO has substantial represen-tation of protein modifications: the sub-ontologyrooted at protein modification process(GO:0006464) in the GO biological process ontol-ogy contains 805 terms1 (including both leaf and in-ternal nodes).
This set of terms is the starting pointfor our selection of modifications types to target.First, many specific GO terms can be excludeddue to the different approach to semantic representa-tion taken in event annotation: while GO terms rep-resent detailed concepts without explicit structure(see e.g.
(Ogren et al, 2004)), the event representa-tion is structured, allowing more general terms to beapplied while capturing the same information.
Forexample, many GO modification terms have childnodes that identify the target (substrate) of modifica-tion, e.g.
protein phosphorylation has thechild actin phosphorylation.
In the eventrepresentation, the target of modification is cap-tured through the Theme argument.
Similarly, GOterms may identify the site or region of modifica-tion, which becomes a Site argument in the eventrepresentation (see Figure 2).
To avoid redundancy,we exclude GO terms that differ from a more gen-eral included term only in specifying a substrate ormodification site.
We similarly exclude terms thatspecify a catalyst or refer to regulation of modifi-1GO structure and statistics from data retrieved Dec. 2010.115Figure 2: Comparison of hypothetical text-bound GO an-notation with specific terms (top) and event annotationwith general GO terms (bottom).cation, as these are captured using separate eventsin the applied representation, as illustrated in Fig-ure 1.
For an analogous reason, we do not separatelyinclude type-level distinctions for ?magnitude?variants of terms (e.g.
monoubiquitination,polyubiquitination) as these can be system-atically modeled as aspects that can mark any event(cf.
the low/neutral/high Manner of Nawaz et al(2010)).Second, a number of the GO terms identify reac-tions that are in scope of previously defined (non-modification) event types in existing resources.
Toavoid introducing redundant or conflicting annota-tion with e.g.
the GENIA Event corpus (Kim et al,2008) or BioNLP ST resources, we excluded termsthat involve predominantly (or exclusively) non-covalent binding (included in the scope of the eventtype BINDING) and terms involving the removal ofor binding between the amino acids of a protein, in-cluding protein maturation by peptide bond cleav-age (annotated ?
arguably somewhat inaccurately ?as PROTEIN CATABOLISM in GENIA/BioNLP STdata).
By contrast, we do differentiate between re-actions involving the addition of chemical groups orsmall proteins and those involving their removal, in-cluding e.g.
PALMITOYLATION and DEPALMITOY-LATION as distinct types.
To preserve the ontologystructure, we further include also internal nodes ap-pearing in GO for the purposes of structuring theontology (e.g.
small protein conjugationor removal), although we only apply more spe-cific leaf nodes in event annotation.This selection, aiming to identify the maximalsubset of the protein modification branch of the GOontology relevant to event annotation, resulted inthe inclusion of 74 terms, approximately 9% of thebranch total.
Table 1 shows the relevant part ofthe GO protein modification subontologyterm structure, showing each term only once2 andexcluding very rare terms for space.
(A detailed de-scription of other information in the table is given inthe following sections.
)In addition to GO, we consider protein modifica-tions in the MeSH ontology,3 used to index PubMedcitations with concepts relevant to them.
Further, forresolving cases not appearing in GO, we refer to theUniprot controlled vocabulary of posttranslationalmodifications4 and the Proteomics Standards Ini-tiative Protein Modification Ontology5 (PSI-MOD)(Montecchi-Palazzi et al, 2008).3.2 Protein Modifications in DatabasesA substantial number of databases tracking pro-tein modifications from a variety of perspectives ex-ist, and new ones are introduced regularly.
Thedatabases range from the specific (e.g.
(Gupta et al,1999; Diella et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2010)) to thebroad in scope (Lee et al, 2005; Li et al, 2009).
In-formation on protein modifications is also found ingeneral protein knowledge resources such as Swiss-Prot (Boeckmann et al, 2003) and PIR (Wu et al,2003).
The relative number of entries relevant toeach protein modification in such resources is onepossible proxy for the biological significance of thevarious modifications.
We apply two such estimatesin this work.One of the primary applications of GO is the useof the ontology terms to annotate gene products,identifying their functions.
These annotations, pro-vided by a variety of groups in different efforts (e.g.
(Camon et al, 2004)), are readily available in GOand used in various GO tools as a reflection of theprominence of each of the ontology concepts.
AsGO is a community standard with wide participa-tion and a primary source in this work, we give theseannotation numbers priority in introducing an addi-tional filter: we exclude from detailed analysis anyterm that has no gene product association annota-tions, taking this as an indication that the modifica-2GO allows multiple inheritance, and e.g.
proteinpalmitoylation occurs under both proteinlipidation and protein acylation reflectingthe biological definition.3http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html4http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist5http://www.psidev.info/MOD116GPASysPTMPubMedGENIAOhta?10EPIThisstudyTerm GO IDphosphorylation GO:0006468 8246 24705 93584 546 3 130 85small protein conj./removal GO:0070647small protein conjugation GO:0032446ubiquitination GO:0016567 1724 439 4842 6 - 340 52sumoylation GO:0016925 121 260 886 - - - 101neddylation GO:0045116 66 2 100 - - - 52ufmylation GO:0071569 33 - 1 - - - -urmylation GO:0032447 16 - 7 - - - -pupylation GO:0070490 11 - 15 - - - -small protein removal GO:0070646deubiquitination GO:0016579 360 - 206 0 - 17 2deneddylation GO:0000338 45 - 39 - - - 8desumoylation GO:0016926 20 - 45 - - - 3dephosphorylation GO:0006470 1479 121 8339 28 - 3 1glycosylation GO:0006486 1145 2982 12619 - 122 347 62acylation GO:0043543 1 - 1728 - - - 71acetylation GO:0006473 522 2000 4423 7 90 337 17palmitoylation GO:0018345 49 198 1009 - - - 187myristoylation GO:0018377 27 150 895 - - - 34octanoylation GO:0018190 4 - 11 - - - -palmitoleylation GO:0045234 3 - 0 - - - -alkylation GO:0008213 0methylation GO:0006479 552 499 9749 - 90 374 18lipidation GO:0006497 34 51 258 - - - 16prenylation GO:0018342 64 111 822 - - - 71farnesylation GO:0018343 19 - 118 - - - 48geranylgeranylation GO:0018344 26 - 79 - - - 30deacylation GO:0035601 1 - 331 - - - 1deacetylation GO:0006476 320 6 1056 1 - 50 4depalmitoylation GO:0002084 9 - 81 - - - 9ADP-ribosylation GO:0006471 261 9 3113 - - - 52cofactor linkage GO:0018065lipoylation GO:0009249 53 - 49 - - - 14FAD linkage GO:0018293 46 - 6 - - - -pyridoxal-5-phosphate linkage GO:0018352 6 - 0 - - - -dealkylation GO:0008214 0demethylation GO:0006482 116 - 1465 - - 13 1deglycosylation GO:0006517 22 1 1204 - - 27 0ISG15-protein conjugation GO:0032020 20 - 3 - - - -arginylation GO:0016598 20 - 46 - - - -hydroxylation GO:0018126 20 226 2948 - 103 139 3sulfation GO:0006477 18 132 960 - - - 37carboxylation GO:0018214 17 7 595 - - - 34nucleotidylation GO:0018175 0adenylylation GO:0018117 16 - 116 - - - -uridylylation GO:0018177 1 - 105 - - - -polyglycylation GO:0018094 17 - 14 - - - -de-ADP-ribosylation GO:0051725 16 - 7 - - - 5nitrosylation GO:0017014 14 - 670 - - - -glutathionylation GO:0010731 11 - 279 - - - -biotinylation GO:0009305 8 - 1247 - - - 4deglutathionylation GO:0080058 3 - 42 - - - -delipidation GO:0051697 3 - 303 - - - -oxidation GO:0018158 3 475 23413 - - - 21phosphopantetheinylation GO:0018215 3 - 26 - - - -tyrosinylation GO:0018322 2 - 2 - - - -deamination GO:0018277 1 - 840 - - - -esterification GO:0018350 1 - 1180 - - - -glucuronidation GO:0018411 1 - 705 - - - -polyamination GO:0018184 1 - 13 - - - -Table 1: Protein modifications and protein modification resources.

We chose to use the integrated SysPTMresource (Li et al, 2009), which incorporates datafrom five databases, four webservers, and manualextraction from the literature.
In its initial release,SysPTM included information on ?nearly 50 modifi-cation types?
on over 30,000 proteins.
The columnslabeled GPA and SysPTM in Table 1 show the num-ber of gene product associations for each selectedtype in GO and entries per type in SysPTM, respec-tively.3.3 Protein Modifications in domain literatureAs a final estimate of the relative prominence of thevarious protein modification types, we estimated therelative frequency with which they are discussed inthe literature through simple PubMed search, query-ing the Entrez system for each modification in itsbasic nominalized form (e.g.
phosphorylation) in aprotein-related article.
Specifically, for each modifi-cation string MOD we searched Entrez for?MOD?
[TIAB] AND ?protein?
[TIAB]The modifier [TIAB] specifies to search the title andabstract.
The literal string ?protein?
is included toimprove the estimate by removing references thatinvolve the modification of non-proteins or relatedconcepts that happen to share the term.7 While thisquery is far from a perfect estimate of the actualnumber of protein modifications, we expect it to bea useful as a rough indicator of their relative fre-quencies and more straightforward to assess thanmore involved statistical analyses (e.g.
(Pyysalo etal., 2010)).
The results for these queries are given inthe PubMed column of Table 1.6We are also aware that GO coverage of protein modifica-tions is not perfect: for example, citrullination, eliminylation,sialylation, as well as a number of reverse reactions for addi-tion reactions in the ontology (e.g.
demyristoylation) are notincluded at the time of this writing.
As for terms with no geneproduct associations, we accept these omissions as indicatingthat these modifications are not biologically prominent.7For example, search for only dehydration ?
a modificationwith zero GPA in GO ?
matches nearly 10 times as many doc-uments as search including protein, implying that most of thehits for the former query likely do not concern protein modi-fication by dehydration.
By contrast, the majority of hits forphosphorylation match also phosphorylation AND protein.3.4 Protein Modifications in Event ResourcesThe rightmost four columns of Table 1 present thenumber of annotations for each modification typein previously introduced event-annotated resourcesfollowing the BioNLP ST representation as well asthose annotated in the present study.
While modi-fication annotations are found also in other corpora(e.g.
(Wu et al, 2003; Pyysalo et al, 2007)), weonly include here resources readily compatible withthe BioNLP ST representation.Separating for the moment from consideration thequestion of what level of practical extraction per-formance can be supported by these event annota-tions, we can now provide an estimate of the up-per bound on the coverage of relevant modifica-tion statements for each of the three proxies (GOGPA, SysPTM DB entries, PubMed query hits) sim-ply by dividing the sum of instances of modifica-tions for which annotations exist by the total.
Thus,for example, there are 8246 GPA annotations forPhosphorylation and a total of 15597 GPA an-notations, so the BioNLP ST?09 data (containingonly PHOSPHORYLATION events) could by the GPAestimate cover 8246/15597, or approximately 53%of individual modifications.8For the total coverage of the set of types for whichevent annotation is available given the corpus in-troduced in this study, the coverage estimates are:GO GPA: 98.2%, SysPTM 99.6%, PubMed 97.5%.Thus, we estimate that correct extraction of the in-cluded types would, depending on whether one takesa gene association, database entry, or literature men-tion point of view, cover between 97.5% to 99.6%of protein modification instances ?
a level of cov-erage we suggest is effectively exhaustive for mostpractical purposes.
We next briefly describe our an-notation effort before discarding the assumption thatcorrect extraction is possible and measuring actualextraction performance.4 AnnotationThis section presents the entity and event annotationapproach, document selection, and the statistics ofthe created annotation.8The remarkably high coverage for a single type reflects theZipfian distribution of the modification types; see e.g.
Ohta etal.
(2010).1184.1 Entity and Event AnnotationTo maximize compatibility with existing event-annotated resources, we chose to follow the gen-eral representation and annotation guidelines ap-plied in the annotation of GENIA/BioNLP ST re-sources, specifically the BioNLP ST 2011 EPI taskcorpus.
Correspondingly, we followed the GE-NIA gene/gene product (Ohta et al, 2009) annota-tion guidelines for marking protein mentions, ex-tended the GENIA event corpus guidelines (Kim etal., 2008) for the annotation of protein modificationevents, and marked CATALYSIS events following theEPI task representation.
For compatibility, we alsomarked event negation and speculation as in theseresources.
We followed the GO definitions for in-dividual modification types, and in the rare caseswhere a modification discussed in text had no ex-isting GO definition, we extrapolated from the wayin which protein modifications are generally definedin GO, consulting other domain ontologies and re-sources (Section 3.1) as necessary.4.2 Document SelectionAs the distribution of protein modifications inPubMed is extremely skewed, random samplingwould recover almost solely instances of majortypes such as phosphorylation.
As we are inter-ested also in the extraction of very rare modifica-tions, we applied a document selection strategy tar-geted at individual modification types.
We appliedone of two primary strategies depending on whethereach targeted modification type had a correspond-ing MeSH term or not.
If a MeSH term specificto the modification exists, we queried PubMed forthe MeSH term, thus avoiding searches for spe-cific forms of expression that might bias the search.In cases where no specific MeSH term existed,we searched the text of documents marked withthe generic MeSH term protein processing,post-translational for mentions of likelyforms of expression for the modification.9 Fi-nally, in a few isolated instances we applied cus-tom text-based PubMed searches with broader cov-9Specifically, we applied a regular expression incorporatingthe basic form of modification expression and allowing variancethrough relevant affixes and inflections derived from an initialset of annotations for documents for which MeSH terms weredefined.Item CountAbstract 360Word 76806Protein 4698Event type 37Event instance 1142Table 2: Annotation statistics.erage.
Then, as many of the modifications are notlimited to protein substrates, to select documents re-lating specifically to protein modification we pro-ceeded to tagged a large random sample of selecteddocuments with the BANNER named entity tagger(Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) trained on the GENE-TAG corpus (Tanabe et al, 2005) and removed doc-uments with fewer than five automatically taggedgene/protein-related entities.
The remaining docu-ments were then randomly sampled for annotation.104.3 Corpus StatisticsWe initially aimed to annotate balanced numbers ofmodification types in order of their estimated promi-nence, with particular focus on previously untar-geted reaction types involving the addition of chem-ical groups or small proteins.
However, it becameapparent in the annotation process that the extremerarity of some of the modifications as well as thetendency for more frequent modifications to be dis-cussed in texts mentioning rare ones made this im-possible.
Thus, while preserving the goal of es-tablishing broadly balanced numbers of major newmodifications, we allowed the number of rare reac-tions to remain modest.Table 2 summarizes the statistics of the final cor-pus, and the rightmost column of Table 1 showsper-type counts.
We note that as reactions involv-ing the removal of chemical groups or small pro-teins were not separately targeted, only few eventsof such types were annotated.
We did not sepa-rately measure inter-annotator agreement for this ef-fort, but note that this work is an extension of theEPI corpus annotation, for which comparison of in-dependently created event annotations indicated anF-score of 82% for the full task and 89% for the coretargets (see Section 5.1) (Ohta et al, 2011).10This strategy, including MeSH-based search, was appliedalso in the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 EPI task document selec-tion.1195 ExperimentsTo assess actual extraction performance, we per-formed experiments using a state-of-the art event ex-traction system.5.1 Experimental SetupWe first split the corpus into a training/developmentportion and a held out set for testing, placing half ofthe abstracts into each set.
The split was stratifiedby event type to assure that relatively even numbersof each event type were present in both sets.
Alldevelopment was performed using cross-validationon the visible portion of the data, and a single finalexperiment was performed on the test dataset.To assure that our results are comparable withthose published in recent event extraction stud-ies, we adopted the standard evaluation crite-ria of the BioNLP Shared Task.
The evalua-tion is event instance-based and uses the standardprecision/recall/F1-score metrics.
We modified theshared task evaluation software to support the newlydefined event types and ran experiments with thestandard approximate span matching and partial re-cursive matching criteria (see (Kim et al, 2009)).We further follow the EPI task evaluation in re-porting results separately for the extraction of onlyTheme and Cause arguments (core task) and for thefull argument set.5.2 Event extraction methodWe applied the EventMine event extraction system(Miwa et al, 2010a; Miwa et al, 2010b), an SVM-based pipeline system using an architecture similarto that of the best-performing system in the BioNLPST?09 (Bjo?rne et al, 2009); we refer to the studiesof Miwa et al for detailed description of the basesystem.
For analysing sentence structure, we appliedthe mogura 2.4.1 (Matsuzaki and Miyao, 2007) andGDep beta2 (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) parsers.For the present study, we modified the base Event-Mine system as follows.
First, to improve efficiencyand generalizability, instead of using all words astrigger candidates as in the base system, we filteredcandidates using a dictionary extracted from train-ing data and expanded by using the UMLS specialistlexicon (Bodenreider, 2004) and the ?hypernyms?and ?similar to?
relations in WordNet (Fellbaum,1998).
Second, to allow generalization across ar-gument types, we added support for solving a singleclassification problem for event argument detectioninstead of solving multiple classification problemsseparated by argument types.
Finally, to facilitatethe use of other event resources for extraction, weadded functionality to incorporate models trained byother corpora as reference models, using predictionsfrom these models as features in classification.5.3 Experimental resultsWe first performed a set of experiments to determinewhether models can beneficially generalize acrossdifferent modification event types.
The EventMinepipeline has separate classification stages for eventtrigger detection, event-argument detection, and theextraction of complete event structures.
Each ofthese stages involves a separate set of features andoutput labels, some of which derive directly fromthe involved event types: for example, in deter-mining whether a specific entity is the Theme ofan event triggered by the string ?phosphorylation?,the system by default uses the predicted event type(PHOSPHORYLATION) among its features.
It is pos-sible to force the model to generalize across eventtypes by replacing specific types with placehold-ers, for example replacing PHOSPHORYLATION,METHYLATION, etc.
with MODIFICATION.In preliminary experiments on the developmentset, we experimented with a number of such gener-alizations.
Results indicated that while some gen-eralization was essential for achieving good ex-traction performance, most implementation variantsproduced broadly comparable results.
We chose thefollowing generalizations for the final test: in thetrigger detection model, no generalization was per-formed (allowing specific types to be extracted), forargument detection, all instances of event types werereplaced with a generic type (EVENT), and for eventstructure prediction, all instances of specific modi-fication event types (but not CATALYSIS) were re-placed with a generic type (MODIFICATION).
Re-sults comparing the initial, ungeneralized model tothe generalized one are shown in the top two rowsof Table 3.
The results indicate that generalization isclearly beneficial: attempting to learn each of theevent types in isolation leaves F-score results ap-proximately 4-5% points lower than when general-120Core FullInitial 39.40 / 46.36 / 42.60 31.39 / 38.88 / 34.74Generalized 39.02 / 61.18 / 47.65 31.07 / 51.89 / 38.87+Model 41.28 / 61.28 / 49.33 33.66 / 53.06 / 41.19+Ann 38.46 / 66.99 / 48.87 32.36 / 59.17 / 41.84+Model +Ann 41.84 / 66.17 / 51.26 33.98 / 56.00 / 42.30Test data 45.69 / 62.35 / 52.74 38.03 / 54.57 / 44.82Table 3: Experimental results.izing across types.
A learning curve for the gen-eralized model is shown in Figure 3.
While thereis some indication of decreasing slope toward useof the full dataset, the curve suggests performancecould be further improved through additional anno-tation efforts.In a second set of experiments, we investigatedthe compatibility of the newly introduced annota-tions with existing event resources by incorporat-ing their annotations either directly as training data(+Ann) or indirectly through features from predic-tions from a model trained on existing resources(+Model), as well as their combination.
We per-formed experiments with the BioNLP Shared Task2011 EPI task corpus11 and the generalized setting.The results of these experiments are given in themiddle rows of Table 3.
We find substantial bene-fit from either form of existing resource integrationalone, and, interestingly, an indication that the ben-efits of the two approaches can be combined.
Thisresult indicates that the newly introduced corpus iscompatible with the EPI corpus, a major previouslyintroduced resource for protein modification eventextraction.
Evaluation on the test data (bottom rowof Table 3) confirmed that development data resultswere not overfit and generalized well to previouslyunseen data.6 Discussion and ConclusionsWe have presented an effort to directly address thechallenges involved in the exhaustive extraction ofprotein modifications in text.
We analysed the GeneOntology protein modification processsubontology from the perspective of event extractionfor information extraction, arguing that due largelyto the structured nature of the event representation,11When combining EPI annotations directly as additionaltraining abstracts, we filtered out abstracts including possible?missing?
annotations for modification types not annotated inEPI data using a simple regular expression.Figure 3: Learning curve.74 of the 805 ontology terms suffice to capture thegeneral modification types included.
Through ananalysis of the relative prominence of protein modi-fications in ontology annotations, domain databases,and literature, we then filtered and prioritized thesetypes, estimating that correct extraction of the mostprominent half of these types would give 97.5%-99.6% coverage of protein modifications, a level thatis effectively exhaustive for practical purposes.To support modification event extraction and toestimate actual extraction performance, we thenproceeded to manually annotate a corpus of 360PubMed abstracts selected for relevance to the se-lected modification types.
The resulting corpus an-notation marks over 4500 proteins and over 1000 in-stances of modification events and more than triplesthe number of specific protein modification types forwhich text-bound event annotations are available.Experiments using a state-of-the-art event extractionsystem showed that a machine learning method canbeneficially generalize features across different pro-tein modification event types and that incorporationof BioNLP Shared Task EPI corpus annotations canimprove performance, demonstrating the compati-bility of the created resource with existing event cor-pora.
Using the best settings on the test data, wefound that the core extraction task can be performedat 53% F-score.The corpus created in this study is freely availablefor use in research from http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Yo Shidahara and YoshihiroOkuda of NalaPro Technologies for their efforts increating the corpus annotation.
