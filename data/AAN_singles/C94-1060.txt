text phuming, has oftenbeen opposed to the task of l inguistic realization ()1" theinformation selected and organized by the text plan-ning process (el., e.g., MeKeown and Swartout,  1987).However, discourse organizat ion is not possibh', with-out taking into account l inguistic means that  are avail-able to express a part icular  meaning (el., e.g., Meteer,1992; Rubinoff, 1992).
Esl)e.eially the \['allure to in-tegrate lexical choice into the phuming process maylead to monotonous,  awkward, or even ungrammat i -cal text (note that  when used separately, the clausesin ( Ix) and (2a) are fully acceptable): '(I) a. ?

Consider thefollowing examples, which illustrate the three differ-ent reiteration relations (strict repetition in (7a),synonymy in (7b), and superord inat ion  in (7c)):(6) Last summer, Monica flew to Italy,(7) a. while Daniela flew to Norway.b.
while Daniela took the plane to Nor-way.c.
while Daniela travelled to Norway.Further substitution relations such as metaphor icrepet i t ion  (7d), negated  az~tonyray (7e), etc.
canbe added:(7) d. while Daniela wafted away to Norway.e.
Daniela also did not stay at home.Collocation stands for 'any recognizable lezicose-mastic relation' between lexicM expressions in relateddiscourse segments.
Examples of collocation relationsare a t t r ibut ion  (7f), par t i t ion  (7g), means (7h),etc.
:(7) f. it was a very pleasant journey.g.
making a stop over in Munich.It.
it was one of those ~ifl aircrafts.As our examples how, reiteration and collocationrelations help to ensure not only cohesion, but alsocoherence in texts.
Therefore, a text generator has toprovide an organization of lexical resources that tailorsdiscourse structure relations to reiteration and collo-cation relations.
This presupposes, on the one hand,a precise picture of which reiteration and collocationrelations are available in language and how they arerealizable; and, on the other hand, a fine-grained is-course model that contains these relations.To make allowance for the global discourse orga-nization, which is performed independently from lex-ical resources, we suggest a two level text planningtask implementation, with the first level realized by aRhetorical Struclure 7'heory (its'r) (M ann and Thomp-son, 1987) style text planner and the second level --by a separate lexical choice module.
Then, the dis-course organization of a text is done in two steps:in the first step, the text planner predetermines thediscourse structure relations; in the second step, thelexical choice module provides, in accordance with lin-guistic constraints, the final determination and the re-alization of these discourse structure relations.The present paper reports an attempt o define lex-ieally biased discourse structure relations used in apartially implemented lexical choice module.
I)ue tothe lack of space, we do not discuss the module it-self; it is described in detail in (Wanner, 1992, 1994).Here, we demonstrate how discourse organization fortext generation can be refined by lexically biased dis-course structure relations and how these relations arerelated to global discourse relations specified in theoutput of an RST style text planner.In contrast o the most discourse models (cf., e.g.,McKeown, 1985; Ch'osz and Sidner, 1986; Mann andThompson, 1987), which take the clause ~ts the min-imal discourse segment, we consider as discourse seg-ments "perspectives" (cf.
McCoy, 1989) -  specificviews taken on a semantic entity (an object, an ew~'nt,etc.).
A perspective is a wording which is tailored tothe lexical repertoire of an entity; it is realizable as aclause, a phrase, or as a single lexeme.
Each of theclauses in the examples above can be considered as arealization of a single perspective; ~md the reiterationand collocation relations that hold between the clausesas well-defined perspective pairs.In our model, a single perspective is represented as acomposition of Mel'&fl~'s Lexical l,~unctions (hereafterLFs) (Mel'&fl{ and Polgu~re, 11987); perspective pairsare represented as LI~' sequences.The lbllowing distinctive features characterize ourmodel:?
it makes snre that all relations defined ~tre ex-pressible in language,?
it allows for a realization of lexicM relations assubclansal relations between discourse segments,?
it is sensitive to lexical and syntactic wtriations \['orthe realization of discourse structure relations.2 LEX ICAL  FUNCTIONS IN  D IS -COURSE2 .1  The  Bas icsFormally speaking, an L~ f is a standard semantico-lexical relation which holds between a lexeme 1,1 (thekeyword of f ) and a set of lexemes f(t,) (the wdue off).

These criteria nmst beprovided by tile functional con lent we associate witheach sequence (or reiteration and collocation relation,respectively).

In our work, we suggest hat these individualdiscourse structure relations can be organized cohe,'-ently in terms of the fimctions anti semantic distinc-tions they represent.
In accordance with the claimthat the availability of specific LF sequences i depen-dent on the entities the LFs are applied to, we furthexsuggest hat this organization must be done individu-ally for each predicative ntity (el.
Wanner, 1994).Based on this, we define taxonomies (one foreach predicative ntity) which have been inspired bytlalliday's proposal for grouping interclausal logico-semantic relations (el.
Ilalliday, 1985).
l\[ow such anorganization carl be realized efficiently using inheri-tance teclmiques is described in (Wanner, 1992).SThls is not to say that these functions are the only onesthat are possibleAlthough our model is not restricted to interclausalrelations, two features o\[' lIalliday's proposal are wtlu-able to us: (i) that a Iogico-semantic relation 'expands'one wording by an another one rather than connectingtwo given wordings and (ii) that a logico-semantic re-lation can be further decomposed with respect, to its:1. semantics, 2. syntactic realization, 3. communica-tive structure, and 4. with respect to the speaker'sintention, which motiw~tes the selection of this rela-tion during the text production process.In what follows, we discuss first the general taxon-omy of our 'expanding' discourse structure relationsfor processes and then the decomposition of the reh>tions along these four dimensions, l?ollowing the con-ventions in R.ST, we call the expanded part 'nucleus'and the expanding o,e 'satellite'.3.1 Taxonomy of Lexlcal Discourse Re-lationsA taxonomy of lexical discourse, structure relations isto be understood as a hierarchy of alternative choicesof increasingly delicate relations.
The most delicaterelations are I,F sequences represented by their func-tional content.
The top level of the.
taxonomy repre-sents, thus, the most global types of exI)ansion.
Inaccordance with (llalliday, 1985), these are F, Lalm-RATION, MXTENSION, and I,\]NIIANCEMENT.
ELAIt()I1.A-TION subsumes all those, expansions which ensure adeeper understanding of t,he meaning comnmnicatedby the nucleus wording.
A deeper understanding orthe nucleus wording is ensured by reslaling, refining,or clarifying it (the next level of ELABORATION in thetaxonomy).
For example, all reiteration relations areof the I,;LABORATION type.The EXTENSION expansions extend the meaningcomnmnicated by tile nucleus wording.
This can be(lone by introducing a new constituent that is relatedto what has linen said ill the nucleus, by adding anew action of I.he known constitueuts, etc.
Beginningextens ion  is, e.g., an EXTENSION.The ENIIANCIi:MI,'NT expansions qualify the mean-lug conmmnieal.ed I)y tim nucleus wording by addinga reference o\[" causation, time., location, l;qanne.r,mode, etc.
An example of F, NIIANCEMENT iv causa lenhancement.f igure 1 shows ill lllOl'e detail tile ELABORATIONfragment of the taxonomy in network tbrm.
Ac-cording to this figure, ILESTA'PI,3MENT can be real-ized as a conlraslive, a generalized, or as a repeal-ing reslalemenl, respectively.
As shown ill Table 2,CONTII.ASTIVE RESTATEMENT corresponds to tile reit-eration negated antonymy, GENEItAL1ZING II.ESTATE-MENT to superord inat ion ,  respectively.
ItEPl,',ATINGRESTATI,;MENT is further insisting, clarifying, illustra-live, pictoresque, etc.

If the cruse frames are related, tile following threevariations are possible:(i) An RST relation instantiat ion coincides with a lex-ieal discourse structure relation; as, e.g., the instanti-ation of RESTATEMENT in the following rudimentarytext plan coinsides with our RESTATEMENT:(R2/RI.~STaTI~Mtr NT: s tatement1 (SAYING/ SYI'UATION:sayer Sveta/  person: verb iage  #unknown#:manner (quiet: sca le  #minima\]#): ob l igatory - ro les  ( : sayer ,:verbiage, :manner,: situation) ):statement2 (SAYINO/ SITUATION:sayer greta/ person:manner (quiet:scale ~minimal#):obligatory-roles (:sayer,:verbiage, :manner,, , .o :~ituatiQn))) .If so, tim suDciassmeatlon of  the lextcal discoursestructure relation deter,nines its final realization.
Forexample, the above text plan could be realized asa GENERALIZED II.I,~STATF, MI,~NT: S'vela fl'l'islerle; sicsayle elwas .qanz leise lit.
'Sveta whispered; she saidsomething very quietly'; an INTENSIFYING RESTATE-MlgN'r: Svela sagle ehvas sehr leise; sic hauchte eskaum hb'rbar hin llt.
'Sveta said something very quietly;she breathed it hardly audible', etc.
(ii) An RST relation instant iat ion subsumes everal dis-s Case frames are considered tobe unrelated if between themor one of their roles no identity, is-a, causer, location, etc.
rela-tion holds.tinct classes of lexical discourse structure relations; as,e.g., the instantiation of the aST relation CONTRASTin (this plan is also highly simplified):(R2/OONTRAST:act imn (OCCUPATION/ SITUATION:actor  Roman/ nation:actoe Gaul/ state:obligatory-roles (:actor,actee, :situation)):action2 (DeCUPATION/ SITUATION:actor Roman/ nation:actee (village /location:part-of : Gaul):negation +:obligatory-roles (:actor,actee, :situation)))may be realized either as CONTI~ASTIVE CI,ARIFICA-TION (ga) or as CONTR.ASTIVE ENIIANCEMENT (,Oh):(9) a.
(2aul is entirehj occupied by the I~o-marts; well, not enti~vly .
.
.one smallvillage still hohls out.b.
Gaul is uhnost entirehj oecvpied bythe l?omans; but one small village stillhohls out.In this case, tim taxonomy of lexical discourse struc-ture relations is entered at a relatively general level(in the worst case at TOP).
(iii) An lIST relation is not captured by our taxonomy(as, e.g., CONCI,ISSION).
Then, the corresponding easefi'ames are treated as unrelated (see above).5 RELATED WORKOur proposal for tile description of lexically biaseddiscourse structure relations resembles l)anlos'  work(Danlos, 1987), who presented acceptable hmse pat-tern sequences explMtly in a Discourse Grammar.The.
basic difference between Danlos' work and oursis that in the Discourse (h'amrnar, clause pattern se-qtlences are represented as concreLe valency sehelllatltwhile in our model they are represented as functionaldistinctions that encode sequcndes o\[' I,FS.
As a result,we do I/el.
\['aee the probhml of being restricted to aconcrete small domahl as l)anlos does.Metoer's text phumer (Meteer, 1992) is anotherprol)osa.l for the realization of lexically biased dis-course strucl.ure relations.
\[/ut while we argue thatlexically biased (liscourse structure relal;ions are toI)e realized by a functionally motiwd,ed h'.xical choice.model, Meteer sugggests a single struetundly  motirated model For text planning, which also sul)sumeslexical choice.
This is different from, e.g., (R.ubi-neff, 1992), who ensures the expressil)ility o1" discoursestructure relations provide(l I)y a conventional textl)hmner by annotat ing linguistic structures.Elhadad's prol)osal (Elhadad, 1992) to  use 7bpoi(inference ,'ules that encode relations between t)ropo -sitk)ns incorporating lexical material) as discoursestructure relations is aimed at exploit ing lexical phe-nomena for discourse organization.
Elhadad focuses,however, on the 'argumentat ive potential '  of lexiealitems r;~t.her t.llan on lexica.lly biased discourse struc-ture relations.3746 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTUREWORKIn this paper, we argue<l that it, is useful Lo distin-guish between two levels of discourse organization: aglobal discourse organization, which is not afli~cted bylinguistic means; and a finer discourse orgauizal,iou,which is built tip in accordance with the linguistic ma-terial that is availal>le for the meaning communicated.We have shown that reiteration aud collocatiott re-lations may function as discourse stru<:ture relatiousand that these relations are well represented by Lez'-ical Function sequences.
We presented a taxonomyof lexically biased discourse strucl:ure relations, whichis related to l Ial l iday's proposal for grouI>ing inter-clausal logico-semantic relations aud suggested l.o usethis taxonomy ill a lexical ch<>ice niodule.One of the ope=n problenis we face is how sulli<:ientlydetailed COlltP, Xtllal COllstrailits Cttll be aC(lllircd ill or:der to guide the choice of one discourse structllre re-lation over others.
