\]n <>r-der to judge three types of the errors, whichare characters wrongly substituted, deleted orinserted in a Japanese "bunsetsu" and an l';n-glish word, and to correct these errors, thispaper proposes new methods using rn-th or-der Markov chain model for Japanese "l~anji-kana" characters and Fmglish alphabets, as-suming that Markov l)robability of a correctchain of syllables or "kanji-kana" characters igreater than that of erroneous chains.From the results of the experiments, it isconcluded that the methods is usefld for de-tecting as well as correcting these errors inJapanese "bunsetsu" and English words.Key  words: Markov model, error detection,error correction, bunsetsu, substitution, dele-tion, insertion1 In t roduct ionIn order to improve the man-machine in-terface with computers, the <tevelopment ofinput devices such as optical cha.racter tea<l-ets (OCR) or speech recognition devices areexpected, llowew;r, it is not easy to inputJapanese sentences J)y these devices, because.they are written by many kinds of charac-ters, especially thousands of "kanji" charac-ters.
The sentences input through an OCR.or a speech recognition device usuMly containerroneous character strings.The techniques of natural anguage process-ing are expected to find and correct these er-rors.
tIowever, since current technologies ofnatural language analysis have been developedfor correct sentences, they cannot directly beapplied to these problems.
Up to now, statis-tical approaches have been made to this prob-lem.Markov mo<lels are considered to be oneof" machine learning models, sinfilar to neuralnetworks a.nd fuzzy models.
They have beenapplied to character chains of natural lan-g,,a~ges (e.g.,l);nglish)\[l\],\[2\], a.nd to phonemereco~gnition 3 .

The methods arebased on the idea about the relation betweenthe types of errors and the length of a chainin which the wdnes of Markov joint probabilityremain small, l,'urthermore, this method is ap-187plied to detect and correct errors in segmentedEnglish words?Experiments were conducted for the case of2nd-order and 3rd-order Markov model, andthey were applied to Japanese and Englishnewspaper arhcles.
Relevance Factor 1 and"Reeall Factor" R for erroneous characters de-tected and corrected by this method were ex-perimentally evaluated using statistical datafor 70 issues of a daily Japanese newspaperand 5 issues of a daily English newspaper.2 Basic Def in i t ions and theMethod  of Error Detect ionand Error Correct ion using2nd-Order  Markov Mode l2,1 Bas ic  Definit ionsIn this paper, two types of natural lan-guage's sentences are discussed.
One is aJapanese sentence, which is non-segmentedsentence and the other is an English sentence,which is segmented into words.A Japanese sentence can be separated intosyntactic units called '%unsetsu", where a {~" ( "bunsetsu" is composed of one m lependentword" and ~ sequence of n (greater than equalto 0) "dependent words".A "bunsetsu" is a chain of Japanese "kanji-kana" characters or an English word is a chainof alphabets, and are represented by 3' =sl s2...s,~, where s~ is a "kanji-kana" characteror an alphabet.
In particular, a chain, 7 , iscalled a "J-bunsetsu" when all of its elementsare "kanji-kana" characters, and is called a "\[iJ-word" when all of its elements are English al-phabets.
The set of eorre, ct .lapanese "bun-setsu" or English words is represented by Pc.Three types of erroneous "J-bunsetsu" orE-word are dehned as follows:First, a chain ce = N,?~... s\[Zlg;..,  s,;~ iscalled a "(i,k)-Erroneous J-bunsetsu or E-word Wrongly Substituted " ( (i, k ) -EWS)if a subehain fl = t l tu .

The combinato-rial method is denoted in the following way:(1) At first, erroneous "E-words" are detectedby Ispell, but the locations of erroneous alpha-bets in words can not be detected by it.
(2)Next decide the correct candidates words byprocedure 3 and 4.
