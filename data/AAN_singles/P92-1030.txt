rochester, eduABSTRACTWe present a new compositional tense-aspect deindex-ing mechanism that makes use of tense trees as com-ponents of discourse contexts.
The mechanism allowsreference pisodes to be correctly identified even forembedded clauses and for discourse that involves hiftsin temporal perspective, and permits deindexed logicalforms to be automatically computed with a small num-ber of deindexing rules.1 In t roduct ionWork on discourse structure, e.g., \[Reichman, 1985;Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Allen, 1987\], has so far takena rather coarse, high-level view of discourse, mostlytreating sentences or sentence-like entities ("utteranceunits, .
.
.

contributions," etc.)
as the lowest-level dis-course elements.
To the extent hat sentences are ana-lyzed at all, they are simply viewed as carriers of certainfeatures relevant to supra-sentential discourse structure:cue words, tense, time adverbials, aspectual class, into-national cues, and others.
These features are presumedto be extractable in some straightforward fashion andprovide the inputs to a higher-level discourse segmentanalyzer.However, sentences (or their logical forms) are not ingeneral "flat," with a single level of structure and fea-tures, but may contain multiple levels of clausal and ad-verbial embedding.
This substructure can give rise toarbitrarily complex relations among the contributionsmade by the parts, such as temporal and discourse rela-tions among subordinate clausal constituents and eventsor states of affairs they evoke.
It is therefore ssen-tial, in a comprehensive analysis of discourse structure,that these intra-sentential relations be systematicallybrought to light and integrated with larger-scale dis-course structures.Our particular interest is in tense, aspect and otherindicators of temporal structure.
We are developing auniform, compositional pproach to interpretation iwhich a parse tree leads directly (in rule-to-rule fash-ion) to a preliminary, indezical logical form, and thisLF is deindezed by processing it in the current context(a well-defined structure).
Deindexing simultaneouslytransforms the LF and the context: context-dependentconstituents ofthe LF, such as operators past, pres andperf and adverbs like today or earlier, are replaced byexplicit relations among quantified episodes; (anaphoraare also deindexed, but this is not discussed here); andnew structural components and episode tokens (andother information) are added to the context.
Thisdual transformation is accomplished by simple recur-sive equivalences and equalities.
The relevant contextstructures are called tense trees; these are what we pro-pose as the "fine structure" of discourse, or at least asa key component of that fine structure.In this paper, we first review Reichenbach's influen-tial work on tense and aspect.
Then we describe tem-poral deindexing using tense trees, and extensions ofthe mechanism to handle discourse involving shifts intemporal perspective.2 Farewel l  to Re ichenbachResearchers concerned with higher-level discourse struc-ture, e.g., Webber \[1987; 1988\], Passonneau \[1988\] andSong and Cohen \[1991\], have almost invariably relied onsome Reichenbach \[1947\]-1ike conception of tense.
Thesyntactic part of this conception is that there are ninetenses in English, namely simple past, present and fu-ture tense, past, present and future perfect tense, andposterior past, present and future tense 1 (plus progres-sive variants).
The semantic part of the conception isthat each tense specifies temporal relations among ex-actly three times particular to a tensed clause, namelythe event time (E), the reference time (R) and thespeech time (S).
On this conception, information indiscourse is a matter of "extracting" one of the nine Re-ichenbachian tenses from each sentence, asserting the1Exarnples of expressions in posterior tense are would, wasgoing to (posterior past), is going to (posterior p esent), and willbe going to (posterior future).232appropriate relations among E, R and S, and appro-priately relating these times to previously introducedtimes, taking account of discourse structure cues im-plicit in tense shifts.It is easy to understand the appeal of this approachwhen one's concern is with higher-level structure.
Byviewing sentences as essentially flat, carrying tense as atop-level feature with nine possible values and evoking atriplet of related times, one can get on with the higher-level processing with minimum fuss.
But while there ismuch that is right and insightful about Reichenbach'sconception, it seems to us unsatisfactory from a mod-ern perspective.
One basic problem concerns embeddedclauses.
Consider, for instance, the following passage.
(1) John will find this note when he gets home.
(2) He will think(a) Mary has left(b).Reichenbach's analysis of (2) gives us Eb < S, Rb <Ra, Ea, where tl < t~ means tl is before t2, as below.SI I IEb Rb R~E~That is, John will think that Mary's leaving tookplace some time before the speaker uttered sentence(2).
This is incorrect; it is not even likely that Johnwould know about the utterance of (2).
In actuality,(2) only implies that John will think Mary's leavingtook place some time before the time of his thinking,i.e., S < Ra, Ea and Eb < Rb, Ra , as shown below.S ~ Ra,E~Eb f RbThus, Reichenbach's system fails to take into accountthe local context created by syntactic embedding.Attempts have been made to refine Reichenbach'stheory (e.g., \[Hornstein, 1977; Smith, 1978; Nerbonne,1986\]), but we think the lumping together of tenseand aspect, and the assignment of E, R, S triples toall clauses, are out of step with modern syntax and se-mantics, providing a poor basis for a systematic, om-positional account of temporal relations within clausesand between clauses.
In particular, we contend thatEnglish past, present, future and perfect are separatemorphemes making separate contributions to syntacticstructure and meaning.
Note that perfect have, likemost verbs, can occur untensed ("She is likely to haveleft by now").
Therefore, if the meaning of other tensedverbs such as walks or became is regarded as compos-ite, with the tense morpheme supplying a "present" or"past" component of the meaning, the same ought o besaid about tensed forms of have.
The modals will andwould do not have untensed forms.
Nevertheless, con-siderations of syntactic and semantic uniformity suggestthat they too have composite meanings, present or pasttense being one part and "future modality" the other.This unifies the analyses of the modals in sentences like"He knows he will see her again" and "He knew hewould see her again," and makes them entirely parallelto paraphrases in terms of going to, viz., "He knows heis going to see her again" and "He knew he was goingto see her again."
We take these latter "posterior tense"forms to be patently hierarchical (e.g., is going to seeher has 4 levels of VP structure, counting to as an aux-iliary verb) and hence semantically composite on anycompositional ccount.
Moreover, going to can bothsubordinate, and be subordinated by, perfect have, asin "He is going to have left by then."
This leads to ad-ditional "complex tenses" missing from Reichenbach'slist.We therefore offer a compositional ccount in whichoperators corresponding to past (past), present (pres),future (futr) and perfect (perf) contribute separatelyand uniformly to the meanings of their operands, i.e.,formulas at the level of LF.
Thus, for instance, the tem-poral relations implicit in "John will have left" are ob-tMned not by extracting a "future perfect" and assertingrelations among E, R and S, but rather by successivelytaking account of the meanings of the nested pres, futrand perf operators in the LF of the sentence.
As ithappens, each of those operators implicitly introducesexactly one episode, yielding a Reichenbach-like r sultin this case.
(But note: a simple present sentence like"John is tired" would introduce only one episode con-current with the speech time, not two, as in Reichen-bach's analysis.)
Even more importantly for presentpurposes, each ofpres, past, futr and perf is treated uni-formly in deindexing and context change.
More specif-ically, they drive the generation and traversal of tensetrees in deindexing.3 Tense  TreesTense trees provide that part of a discourse contextstructure 2 which is needed to interpret (and deindex)temporal operators and modifiers within the logicalform of English sentences.
They differ from simple listsof Reichenbachian indices in that they organize pisodetokens (for described episodes and the utterances them-selves) in a way that echoes the hierarchy of temporaland modal operators of the sentences and clauses fromwhich the tokens arose.
In this respect, they are anal-2In general, the context structure would also contain speakerand hearer parameters, temporal and spatial frames, and to-kens for salient referents other than episodes, among othercomponents--see \[Allen, 1987\].233ogous to larger-scale representations of discourse struc-ture which encode the hierarchic segment structure ofdiscourse.
(As will be seen, the analogy goes further.
)Tense trees for successive sentences are "overlaid" insuch a way that related episode tokens typically end upas adjacent elements of lists at tree nodes.
The traver-sal of trees and the addition of new tokens is simply andfully determined by the logical forms of the sentencesbeing interpreted.The major advantage of tense trees is that they al-low simple, systematic interpretation (by deindexing)of tense, aspect, and time adverbials in texts consistingof arbitrarily complex sentences, and involving implicittemporal reference across clause and sentence bound-aries.
This includes certain relations implicit in theordering of clauses and sentences.
As has been fre-quently observed, for a sequence of sentences withinthe same discourse segment, the temporal reference ofa sentence is almost invariably connected to that of theprevious entence in some fashion.
Typically, the rela-tion is one of temporal precedence or concurrency, de-pending on the aspectual class or aktionsart involved(eft, "John closed his suitcase; He walked to the door"versus "John opened the door; Mary was sleeping").However, in "Mary got in her Ferrari.
She bought itwith her own money," the usual temporal precedence isreversed (based on world knowledge).
Also, other dis-course relations could be implied, such as cause-of, ex-plains, elaborates, etc.
(more on this later).
Whateverthe relation may be, finding the right pair of episodesinvolved in such relations is of crucial importance fordiscourse understanding.
Echoing Leech \[1987, p41\], weuse the predicate constant orients, which subsumes allsuch relations.
Note that the orients predications canlater be used to make probabilistic or default inferencesabout the temporal or causal relations between the twoepisodes, based on their aspectual class and other infor-mation.
In this way they supplement the informationprovided by larger-scale discourse segment structures.We now describe tense trees more precisely.Tense  Tree  S t ruc tureThe form of a tense tree is illustrated in Figure 1.
Asan aid to intuition, the nodes in Figure 1 are annotatedwith simple sentences whose indexical LFs would leadto those nodes in the course of deindexing.
A tense treenode may have up to three branches--a leftward pastbranch, a downward perfect branch, and a rightwardfuture branch.
Each node contains a stack-like list ofrecently introduced episode tokens (which we will oftenrefer to simply as episodes).In addition to the three branches, the tree may have(horizontal) embedding links to the roots of embed-ded tense trees.
There are two kinds of these embed-ding links, both illustrated in Figure 1.
One kind,utterance presnode .

A Tense  Treeindicated by dashed lines, is created by subordinat-ing constructions such as VPs with that-complementclauses.
The other kind, indicated by dotted lines, isderived from the surface speech act (e.g., telling, ask-ing or requesting) implicit in the mood of a sentence.On our view, the utterances of a speaker (or sentencesof a text, etc.)
are ultimately to be represented interms of modal predications expressing these surfacespeech acts, such as \[Speaker tell Hearer  (That ~)\]or \[Speaker ask Hearer  (Whether ~)\].
Although thesespeech acts are not explicitly part of what the speakeruttered, they are part of what the hearer gathers froman utterance.
Speaker and Hearer  are indexical con-stants to be replaced by the speaker(s) and the hearer(s)of the utterance context.
The two kinds of embeddinglinks require slightly different ree traversal techniquesas will be seen later.A set of trees connected by embedding links is calleda tense tree structure (though we often refer loosely totense tree structures as tense trees).
This is in effect atree of tense trees, since a tense tree can be embeddedby only one other tree.
At any time, exactly one nodeof the tense tree structure for a discourse is in focus,and the focal node is indicated by ~).
Note that the"tense tree" in Figure 1 is in fact a tense tree structure,with the lowest node in focus.By default, an episode added to the right end of alist at a node is "oriented" by the episode which waspreviously rightmost.
For episodes tored at differentnodes, we can read off their temporal relations from thetree roughly as follows.
At any given moment, for apair of episodes e and e' that are rightmost at nodes nand n', respectively, where n' is a daughter of n, if thebranch connecting the two nodes is a past branch, Is'234before e\]3; if it is a perfect branch, \[e' impinges-on e\](as we explain later, this yields entailments \[e' before e\]if e' is nonstative and \[e' until e\] if e' is stative, respec-tively illustrated by "John has left" and "John has beenworking"); if it is a future branch, \[d after e\]; and if itis an embedding link, \[d at-about e\].
These orientingrelations and temporal relations are not extracted posthoc, but rather are automatically asserted in the courseof deindexing using the rules shown later.As a preliminary example, consider the following pas-sage and a tense tree annotated with episodes derivedfrom it by our deindexing rules:(3) John picked up the phone.
(4) He had told Mary thatu j , .
,?
...... 2 '  J pas tepick, el ?fperfetellCD - - /~e2 ~: the would call her.ecallu3 and u4 are utterance pisodes for sentences (3) and(4) respectively.Intuitively, the temporal content of sentence (4) isthat the event of John's telling, etdz, took place beforesome time el, which is at the same time as the eventof John's picking up the phone, epiek; and the event ofJohn's calling, eean, is located after some time e2, whichis the at the same time as the event of John's telling,eteu.
For the most part, this information can be readoff directly from the tree: \[eple~ orients el\], \[etett beforeel\] and \[eeatt after e2\].
In addition, the deindexing rulesyield \[e2 same-time tell\].
From this, one may infer \[etellbefore epic~\] and \[ecau after eteu\], assuming that theorients relation defaults to same-time here.How does \[epiek orients el\] default o \[epiek same-timeeli?
In the tense tree, el is an episode evoked by thepast tense operator which is part of the meaning of hadin (4).
It is a stative episode, since this past opera-tor logically operates on a sentence of form (perf &),and such a sentence describes a state in which & hasoccurred--in this instance, a state in which John hastold Mary that he will call her.
It is this stativity ofel which (by default) leads to a same-time interpreta-tion of orients.
4 Thus, on our account, the tendencyof past perfect "reference time" to align itself with a3Or, somet imes,  same-time (cf., " John noticed that  Marylooked pale" vs. "Mary realized that  someone broke her vase").This is not  decided in an ad hoc manner, but as a result of sys-tematically interpreting the context-charged relation belT.
Moreon this later.4 More accurately, the default interpretation is \[(end-of epick )same-t ime ell, in view of examples involving a longer precedingevent, such as " John painted a picture.
He was pleased with theresult.
"previously introduced past event is just an instance of ageneral tendency of stative episodes to align themselveswith their orienting episode.
This is the same tendencynoted previously for "John opened the door.
Mary wassleeping."
We leave further comments about particu-larizing the orients relation to a later subsection.We remarked that the relation \[e2 same-time tett\] isobtained irectly from the deindexing rules.
We leave itto the reader to verify this in detail (see Past and Fut rrules stated below).
We note only that e2 is evokedby the past tense component of would in (4), and de-notes a (possible) state in which John will call Mary.Its stativity, and the fact that the subordinate clausein (4) is "past-dominated, ''5 causes \[e2 bef T eteu\] to bedeindexed to \[e2 same-time tch\].We now show how tense trees are modified as dis-course is processed, in particular, how episode tokensare stored at appropriate nodes of the tense tree, andhow deindexed LFs, with orients and temporal orderingrelations incorporated into them, are obtained.Processin~ of UtterancesThe processing of the (indexical) LF of a new utter-ance always begins with the root node of the currenttense tree (structure) in focus.
The processing of thetop-level operator immediately pushes a token for thesurface speech act onto the episode list of the root node.Here is a typical indexical LF:( decl (past \[John know (That(past (', (perf \[Mary leave\]))))\]))"John knew that Mary had not left.
"(decl stands for declarative; its deindexing rule intro-duces the surface speech act of type "tell").
As men-tioned earlier, our deindexing mechanism is a composi-tional one in which operators past, futr, perf, -,, That,decl, etc., contribute separately to the meaning of theiroperands.
As the LF is recursively transformed, thetense and aspect operators encountered, past, perf andfutr, in particular, cause the focus to shift "downward"along existing branches (or new ones if necessary).
Thatis, processing a past operator shifts the current focusdown to the left, creating a new branch if necessary.The resulting tense tree is symbolized as /T .
Similarlyperf shifts straight down, and futr shifts down to theright, with respective results t T and \ T. pres maintainsthe current focus.
Certain operators embed new treesat the current node, written ~--~T (e.g., That), or shiftfocus to an existing embedded tree, written ?--*T (e.g.,decl).
Focus shifts to a parent or embedding node aresymbolized as T T and .--T respectively.
As a final treeoperation, OT denotes torage of episode token e T (anew episode symbol not yet used in T) at the current5A node is past-domlnated if there is a past branch in its an-cestry (where embedding finks also count as ancestry links).235focus, as rightmost element of its episode list.
As eachnode comes into focus, its episode list and the lists atcertain nodes on the same tree path provide explicit ref-erence episodes in terms of which past, pres, futr, pert,time adverbials, and implicit "orienting" relations arerewritten nonindexically.
Eventually the focus returnsto the root, and at this point, we have a nonindexicalLF, as well as a modified tense tree.Deindexin~ RulesBefore we proceed with an example, we show some ofthe basic deindexing rules here.

Note that each equivalencepushes the dependence on context one level deeper intothe LF, thus deindexing the top-level operator.
The6See \[Hwang, 1992\] for the rest of our deindexing rules.
Someof the omitted ones are: Fpres ( "futural present," as in "John hasa meeting tomorrow"), Prog (progressive aspect), Pred (predica-tion), K, Ka and Ke ("kinds"), those for deindexing various oper-ators (especially, negation and adverbials), etc.r For details of Episodic Logic, our semantic representation, see\[Schubert and Hwang, 1989; Hwang and Schubert, 1991\].symbols NOWT, Last T and Emb T refer respectively to thespeech time for the most recent utterance in T, the last-stored episode at the current focal node, and the last-stored episode at the current embedding node.
bet Tin the Past-rule will he replaced by either before orsame-time, depending on the aspectual class of its firstargument and on whether the focal node of T is past-dominated.
In the Pert-rule, Last T is analogous tothe Reichenbachian reference time for the perfect.
Theimpinges-on relation confines its first argument e T (thesituation or event described by the sentential operand ofpert) to the temporal region preceding the second argu-ment.
As in the case of orients, its more specific importdepends on the aspectual types of its arguments.
If e T isa stative episode, impinges-on entails that the state orprocess involved persists to the reference time (episode),i.e., \[e T until LastT\].
If e T is an event (e.g., an accom-plishment), impinges-on entails that it occurred some-time before the reference time, i.e., \[e T before LaStT\],and (by default) its main effects persist to the referencetime.
sAn ExampleTo see the deindexing mechanism at work, consider nowsentences (ha) and (Ca).
(5) a. John went to the hospital.b.
(decl Ta (past Tb \[John goto Hospital\] ) ) Tcc.
(3 el:tel same-time Now1\]\[\[Speaker t ll Hearer (That(3 e2:\[e2 before ell\[\[John goto Hospital\] ** e2\]))\]** ell)(6) a.

Also, we are settingaside certain well-known problems involving temporal adverbialsin perfect sentences, uch as the inadmissibility of * " John has leftyesterday."
For a possible approach, see \[Schubert and Hwang,1990\].236The LFs before deindexing are shown in (5,6b) (wherethe labelled arrows mark points we will refer to); thefinal, context-independent LFs are in (5,6c).
The trans-formation from (b)'s to (c)'s and the correspondingtense tree transformations are done with the deindex-ing rules shown earlier.
Anaphoric processing ispresup-posed here.The snapshots of the tense tree while processing (5b)and (6b), at points Ta-Ti, are as follows (with a nullinitial context).a ta  a tb  at ?

"What is important here is, first, that Reichenbach-likerelations are introduced compositionally; e.g., \[e6 beforee5\], i.e., the breaking of the ankle, e6, is before the stateJohn is in at the time of the doctor's talking to him, e4.In addition, the recursive rules take correct account ofembedding.
For instance, the embedded present perfectin a sentence such as "John will think that Mary hasleft" will be correctly interpreted as relativized to John's(future) thinking time, rather than the speech time, asin a Reichenbachian analysis.But beyond that, episodes evoked by successive sen-tences, or by embedded clauses within the same sen-tence, are correctly connected to each other.
In par-ticular, note that the orienting relation between John'sgoing to the hospital, e2, and the doctor's diagnosis, e4,is automatically incorporated into the deindexed for-mula (6c).
We can plausibly particularize this orientingrelation to \[e4 after e2\], based on the aspectual class of"goto" and "tell" (see below).
Thus we have establishedinter-clausal connections automatically, which in otherapproaches require heuristic discourse processing.
Thiswas a primary motivation for tense trees.
Our schemeis easy to implement, and has been successfully used inthe TRAINS interactive planning advisor at Rochester\[Allen and Schubert, 1991\].More on ParC icu la r i z in~ the ORIENTS Re la?
ionThe orients relation is essentially an indicator thatthere could be a more specific discourse relation betweenthe argument episodes.
As mentioned, it can usuallybe particularized to one or more temporal, causal, orother "standard" discourse relation.
Existing propos-als for getting these discourse relations right appear tobe of two kinds.
The first uses the aspectual classesof the predicates involved to decide on discourse re-lations, especially temporal ones, e.g., \[Partee, 1984\],\[Dowty, 1986\] and \[Hinrichs, 1986\].
The second ap-proach emphasizes inference based on world knowledge,e.g., \[Hobbs, 1985\] and \[Lascarides and Asher, 1991;Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992\].
The work by Las-carides et hi.
is particularly interesting in that it makesuse of a default logic and is capable of retracting previ-ously inferred discourse relations.Our approach fully combines the use of aspectualclass information and world knowledge.
For example, in"Mary got in her Ferrari.
She bought it with her ownmoney," the successively reported "achievements" areby default in chronological order.
Here, however, thisdefault interpretation of orients is reversed by worldknowledge: one owns things after buying them, ratherthan before.
But sometimes world knowledge ismute onthe connection.
For instance, in "John raised his arm.A great gust of wind shook the trees," there seems to beno world knowledge supporting temporal adjacency ora causal connection.
Yet we tend to infer both, perhapsattributing magical powers to John (precisely becauseof the lack of support for a causal connection by worldknowledge).
So in this case default conclusions basedon orients seem decisive.
In particular, we would as-sume that if e and e' are nonstative pisodes, 9 where eis the performance of a volitional action and e' is not,then \[e orients e'\] suggests \[e right-before d\] and (lessfirmly) \[e cause-of d\].
1?4 Beyond Sentence PairsThe tense tree mechanism, and particularly the way inwhich it automatically supplies orienting relations, iswell suited for longer narratives, including ones withtense shifts.
Consider, for example, the following(slightly simplified) text from \[Allen, 1987, p400\]:(7) a. Jack and Sue went{e~} to a hardware storeb.
as someone had{e~} stolen{~5} their lawnmower.c.
Sue had{e4} seen{eh} a man take it9Non-statives could be achievements, accomplishments, cul-minations, etc.
Our aspectual class system is not entirely sett ledyet, but  we expect  to have  one s imi lar  to that  of \[Moens andSteedman, 1988\].1?Our approach to plausible inference in episodic logic in gen-eral, and to such default inferences in particular, is probabilistic(see \[Schubert and Hwang, 1989; Hwang, 1992\]).
The hope is thatwe will be able to "weigh the evidence" for or against alternativediscourse relations (as particularizations of orients).237d.
and had{,,} chased{e,} him down the street,e.
but he had{e,} driven{,g} away in a truck.f.
After looking{,,o} in the store, they realized{,in}that they couldn't afford{,~} a new one.Even though {b-e} would normally be considered a sub-segment of the main discourse {a, f}, both the temporalrelations within each segment and the relations betweensegments (i.e., that the substory temporally precedesthe main one) are automatically captured by our rules.For instance, el and ell are recognized as successiveepisodes, both preceded at some time in the past bye3, es, eT, and eg, in that order.This is not to say that our tense tree mechanism ob-viates the need for larger-scale discourse structures.
Ashas been pointed out by Webber \[1987; 1988\] and oth-ers, many subnarratives introduced by a past perfectsentence may continue in simple past.
The following isone of Webber's examples:(8) a. I was{,l} at Mary's house yesterday.b.
We talked{,2} about her sister Jane.c.
She had{e3} spent{e,} five weeks in Alaskawith two friends.d.
Together, they climbed{,,} Mt.
McKinley.e.
Mary askedoe } whether I would want to go toAlaska some time.Note the shift to simple past in d, though as Web-bet points out, past perfect could have been used.
Theabandonment of the past perfect in favor of simple pastsignals the temporary abandonment of a perspectiveanchored in the main narrative - thus bringing read-ers "closer" to the scene (a zoom-in effect).
In sucheases, the tense tree mechanism, unaided by a notion ofhigher-level discourse segment structure, would deriveincorrect temporal relations uch as \[e5 orients e6\] or\[e6 right-after es\].We now show possible deindexing rules for perspec-tive shifts, assuming for now that such shifts are inde-pendently identifiable, so that they can be incorporatedinto the indexical LFs.
new-pets is a sentence operatorinitiating a perspective shift for its operand, and prey-pets is a sentence (with otherwise no content) whichgets back to the previous perspective.
Recent T is theepisode most recently stored in the subtree immediatelyembedded by the focal node of T.New-pets: (new-pers ?
)T*'* \[$,-.
T A \[Itecent T orients RecentT,\]\]where T' = $"  (~-~ T)Tree transform :(new-pers ~)"  T = ~" (~-* T)Prev-pe\]:s: prev-pers T ---.
T (True)Tree transform : prev-pers ?
T = ~ TWhen new-pers is encountered, a new tree is createdand embedded at the focal node, the focus is moved tothe root node of the new tree, and the next sentence isprocessed in that context.
In contrast with other op-erators, new-pets causes an overall focus shift to thenew tree, rather than returning the focus to the orig-inal root.
Note that the predication \[Recen*c T orientsRecen'~T, \] connects an episode of the new sentence withan episode of the previous entence, prey-pets producesa trivial True, but it returns the focus to the embed-ding tree, simultaneously blocking the link between theembedding and the embedded tree (as emphasized byuse of ~ instead of ~---).We now illustrate how tense trees get modified overperspective changes, using (8) as example.
We re-peat (Sd,e) below, augmenting them with perspectivechanges, and show snapshots of the tense trees at thepoints marked.

Also, note that RecentT1 = e4 and Recenl;T2 = e5.So, by Hew-pets, we get \[e4 orients e5\], which can belater particularized to \[e5 during e4\].
It is fairly obvi-ous that the placement of new-pers and prev-pers oper-ators is fully determined by discourse segment bound-aries (though not in general coinciding with them).
So,as long as the higher-level discourse segment structureis known, our perspective rules are easily applied.
Inthat sense, the higher-level structure supplements he"fine structure" in a crucial way.However, this leaves us with a serious problem: dein-dexing and the context change it induces is supposedto be independent of "plausible inferencing"; in fact,238it is intended to set the stage for the latter.
Yet thedetermination f higher-level discourse structure--andhence of perspective shifts--is unquestionably a matterof plausible inference.
For example, if past perfect is fol-lowed by past, this could signal either a new perspectivewithin the current segment (see 8c,d), or the closing ofthe current subsegment with no perspective shift (see7e,f).
If past is followed by past, we may have eithera continuation of the current perspective and segment(see 9a,b below), or a perspective shift with opening ofa new segment (see 9b,c), or closing of the current seg-ment, with resumption of the previous perspective (see9c,d).
(9) a. Mary found that her favorite vase was broken.b.
She was upset.c.
She bought it at a special antique auction,d.
and she was afraid she wouldn't be able to findanything that beautiful again.Only plausible inference can resolve these ambiguities.This inference process will interact with resolution ofanaphora nd introduction of new individuals, identifi-cation of spatial and temporal frames, the presence ofmodal/cognition/perception verbs, and most of all willdepend on world knowledge.
In (9), for instance, onemay have to rely on the knowledge that one normallywould not buy broken things, or that one does not buythings one already owns.As approaches to this general difficulty, we are think-ing of the following two strategies: (A) Make a best ini-tial guess about presence or absence of new-pers/prev-pres, based on surface (syntactic) cues and then usefailure-driven backtracking if the resulting interpreta-tion is incoherent.
A serious disadvantage would be lackof integration with other forms of disambiguation.
(B)Change the interpretation f LaStT, in effect providingmultiple alternative referents for the first argument oforients.
In particular, we might useLast T = {ei \[ ei is the last-stored episode at thefocus of T, or was stored in the subtreerooted at the focus of T after the last-stored episode at the focus of T}.Subsequent processing would resemble anaphora disam-biguation.
In the course of further interpreting the dein-dexed LF, plausible inference would particularize theschematic orienting relation to a temporal (or causal,etc.)
relation involving just two episodes.
The resultwould then be used to make certain structural changesto the tense tree (after LF deindexing).For instance, suppose such a schematic orienting re-lation is computed for a simple past sentence followinga past perfect sentence (like 8c,d).
Suppose further thatthe most coherent interpretation f the second sentence(i.e., 8d) is one that disambiguates the orienting rela-tion as a simple temporal inclusion relation between thesuccessively reported events.
One might then move theevent token for the second event (reported in simplepast) from its position at the past node to the right-most position at the past perfect node, just as if the sec-ond event had been reported in the past perfect.
(Onemight in addition record a perspective shift, if this isstill considered useful.)
In other words, we would "re-pair" the distortion of the tense tree brought about bythe speaker's "lazy" use of simple past in place of pastperfect.
Then we would continue as before.In both strategies we have assumed a generalcoherence-seeking plausible inference process.
While itis clear that the attainment of coherence ntails delin-eation of discourse segment structure and of all relevanttemporal relations, it remains unclear in which directionthe information flows.
Are there independent principlesof discourse and temporal structure operating above thelevel of syntax and LF, guiding the achievement of fullunderstanding, or are higher-level discourse and tem-poral relations a mere byproduct of full understanding?Webber \[1987\] has proposed independent temporal fo-cusing principles imilar to those in \[Grosz and Sid-net, 1986\] for discourse.
These are not deterministic,and Song and Cohen \[1991\] sought o add heuristic on-straints as a step toward determinism.
For instance,one constraint is based on the presumed incoherenceof simple present followed by past perfect or posteriorpast.
But there are counterexamples; e.g., "Mary isangry about the accident.
The other driver had beendrinking."
Thus, we take the question about indepen-dent structural principles above the level of syntax andLF to be still open.5 ConclusionWe have shown that tense and aspect can be analyzedcompositionally in a way that accounts not only for theirmore obvious effects on sentence meaning but also, viatense trees, for their cumulative ffect on context andthe temporal relations implicit in such contexts.
Assuch, the analysis eems to fit well with higher-levelanalyses of discourse segment structure, though ques-tions remain about the flow of information between lev-els.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge helpful comments by JamesAllen and Philip Harrison on an earlier draft and muchuseful feedback from the members of TRAINS groupat the University of Rochester.
