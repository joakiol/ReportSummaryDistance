Examples of systems which usepred ic t ion  are FRUMP (DeJong 79) and(Schank 75a) .
The proper -ty  of in teres t  here i s  that  the i r  bas ic  mode of work i~ i s  todetermine whether an input  text  fo l lows one of the systemsp~s-spec i f ied  pat terns ;  in  o ther  words they pred ic t ,  to someextent ,  the form the i r  input  texts  w i l l  take .
A c ruc ia l  pro-blem for  such systems i s  the se lec t ion  of su i tab le  sets  ofp red ic t ions ,  or  pat terns ,  to be app l ied  to  any par t i cu la~text ,  and  i t  i s  th i s  problem 1 want to address in  the paper.I w i l l  assume that  the pred ic t ions  are organised i n tobundles  acoord i~ to the top is  of the texts  to which theyapply .
This i s  a genera l i sa t ion  of the sc r ip t  idea  employedb~ (DeJong 79) and (Schank75a).

Those cand idates  which arenot  e l im inated  are then  ident i f ied  as the top ics  of the text- 281  -sect ion .
(There may on ly  be one such cand idate . )
This approacha l lows the use o f  a lgor i thms fo r  suggest ing  poss ib le  top icswhich t ry  to ensure that  i f  the system possesses  a su i tab les te reotype  fo r  a text  sec t ion  i t  i s  ac t ivated ,  even at  theexpense of  ac t ivat ing  la rEe  numbers of  i r re levant  s te reotypes .This techn ique  has been tes ted  in  a computer systemca l led  Scrabb le .2!

(For  the purposes of  th i spaper i t  i s  assumed that  the system has access  to  a lex iconconta in ing  ent r ies  whose semant ic  component 18 something l i kethat  used by (Wilks 77) . )
As a word i s  input  to the systemthe senses  of  the  word are examined to determine i f  any ofthem have a semant ic  descr ip t ion  which conta ins  a pat ternassoc ia ted  w i th  any of  the system s s te reotypes .

In  Scrabb le ,  the sentences  of  the text  a re  f i r s tparsed in to  a var iant  of  Conceptual  Dependency (CD) represent -a t ion  (Schank 75b) by a program descr ibed  in  (Cater  80) .
Thesemant ic  representat ion  scheme lxas been extended to inc ludenominal descr ip t ions  s imi la r  in  power to those  used by (Wilke77) .

Boththe supermarket and k i tchen  s tereotypes  expect sentences  l l ke- 283 -the f i r s t  in  the text .

In  such a system add i t iona l  s te reotypeswould probably be ac t ivated  by the  occur rence  o f  the pr imi t ivepat tern  fo r  food,  and i t  i s  l i ke ly  that  yet  more s tereotypeswould be ac t ivated  by d i f fe rent  p r imi t ive  pat terns  in  thelex icon  ent r ies  fo r  the words in  the input  text .5J Conclus ionsThe techn ique  descr ibed  in  th i s  paper fo r  the ident i f i c -a t ion  o f  the top ic  of  a text  sec t ion  has a number of  advant -aKe8 over  prev ious  schemes.
F i r s t ,  i t s  use of  in fo rmat ionwhich w i l l  probably  a l ready  be s to red  in  the natura l  languageprocess ing  sys tem's  lex icon  has obvious advantages overschemes which requ i re  la rge ,  separate  data -s t ruc tures  pure lyfo r  top ic  ident i f i ca t ion ,  as we l l  as fo r  making the pred ic t -i ons  ussoo la ted  w i th  a top ic?
In  p ract i ce ,  Scrabb le  uses as l ight ly  doctored  lex icon  to  improve e f f i c iency ,  but thenecessary  work could be done by an automat ic  proprooess~Lngof  the lex icon .Second, the scheme descr ibed  here can make use o fnominal8 which suggest  a cand idate  top ic ,  and assoc ia teds tereotypes ,  w i thout  complex ma~tpu la t ion  of  semant ic  in fo rm-a t ion  which I s  not  use fu l  fo r  thAs purpose.
The scheme of- 284  -(DeJong 79) ,  fo r  example, would perform complex opeZattonson semantic  representat ions  assoc ia ted  wi th  "p ick"  before I tprocessed the more use fu l  word " tuna"  i f  I t  processed theabove example text .Third the use of semantl.o p r imi t ive  pat terns  has great -  ,er  genera l i ty  than  techn iques  which set  up d i rec t  l inks  bet -ween words and bundles  of p red ic t ions ,  as appeared to  be donein  ear ly  vers ions  of the SAM program (Sohank 75a) .One f ina l  po in t .
The techn ique fo r  top ic  ident i f i ca t ionin  th i s  paper would not be pract i ca l  e i ther  i f  i t  was veryexpensive to load s tereotypes  which turn  out to be I r re levant ,or  i f  the cost of comparing the pred ic t ions  of such s tereo-types with the text  representat ion  was h igh.
The Scr~bblesystem, runn ing  under Cambridge LISP on an IBM 370/165 took8770 mi l l i seconds  to ana lyse  the example text  above of which756 mi l l i seconds  was used by load ing  and act ivat iDg  the twoi r re levant  s te reotypes  and 103 mi l l i seconds  was spent  compar-ing  the i r  p red ic t ions  wi th  the CD-x~presentat ion f the text .The system des ign  i s  such that  these f igures  would not  in -crease dremat ica l ly  i f  more s tereotypes  were cons idered wh i l s tp rocess ing  the example.6 t References(Cater  80)Cater ,  A.W.S.
