Proceedings of the 2010 Workshop on Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing, ACL 2010, page 47,Uppsala, Sweden, 16 July 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsSpectral Approaches to Learning in the Graph DomainEdwin HancockDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of YorkYork YO10 5DD, UKerh@cs.york.ac.ukAbstractThe talk will commence by discussing some of the problems that arise when machine learning isapplied to graph structures.
A taxonomy of different methods organised around a) clustering b)characterisation and c) constructing generative models in the graph domain will be introduced.With this taxonomy in hand, Dr. Hancock will then describe a number of graph-spectral al-gorithms that can be applied to solve the many different problems inherent to graphs, drawingexamples from computer vision research.47
