SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONGOALGETTER: GENERATION OF SPOKEN SOCCER REPORTSMari~t Theune and Esther KlabbersIPO, Center for Research on User-System Interaction,Eindhoven University of Technology.Abstract - In this paper we describe ademonstration Of the GoalGetter system, which generates spoken soc-cer reports (in Dutch) on the basis of tabular data.
Two types of speech output are available.
The demo runsvia the web.
It includes the possibility of !creating your own match' and having GoalGetter generate a reporton  this match.

About the system?
The GoalGetter system is a Data-to-Speech system which generates spoken soccer eports (in Dutch) on thebasis of tabular data.
The system takes as input data about a soccer match that are derived from a Teletext?
page.
1The output of the system is a spoken, natural language report conveying the main events of the matchdescribed on the Teletext page,GoalGetter was developed on the basis of D2S, a generic system for the creation of Data-to-Speech systems.The general architecture of D2S is represented in Figure 1.
It consists of two modules, the Language Gen-eration Module (LGM), and the Speech Generation Module (SGM).
The LGM takes data as input .and?
produces enriched text, i.e., text which is annotated with prosodic markers indicating pitch accents and into-national boundarie s. This text is sentas input to the SGM, which turns it into a speech signal.Datan ?ag?
I SPeech I _- Generation EnrichedModule \] " Text ~ Generati?n IModu leSpeechSignalFigure 1" Global architecture of D2SLanguage generation i the LGM is done using syntactic templates, which are syntactic tree structures con-taining slots for variable expressions.
The selection and ordering of the templates and the filling of theirslots depend mainly on conditions on the discourse context, which is represented in a Discourse Model.
Inorder to achieve variation in the generated texts, the system generates a number of different expressions foreach piece of information.
If various expressions are equally suitable given the current contexL one is cho-sen at random.
For a detailed escription of the syntactic template technique we refer to \[Van Deemter &Odijk 97\] and \[Theune et al 97\].In the Prosody module, accentuation and phrasing are determined using information about the syntacticstructure of a sentence and about its context.
Phrases expressing 'new' or 'contrastive' information areaccented while those expressing ' iven' information are deaccented.
Speech generation i the SGM is done1.
Teletext is a system with which information is broadcast along with the television signal and decoded inthe receiver.
The information is distributed over various 'pages', most of which contain textual informa-tion, but some contain tables.292!IItIi|by means of either speech synthesis or an advanced form of phrase concatenation, using different prosodicversions of otherwise identical phrases?.
Which version is chosen depends on the prosodic markings pro-vided by the LGM.
For Dutch speech synthesis, we use the phonetics-to-speech system SPENGI (SPeechsynthesis ENGIne) developed at IPO, which employs PSOLA-based iphones.2.
Outline of the demonstrationThe demonstration f the GoalGetter system runs via the web and consists of three parts.
First we presentan example report hat has been generated off-line by GoalGetter.
This allows us to prepare an (annotated)English translation of the Dutch text in advance.
(In the other parts of the demonstration, preparing a trans-lation is not possible since reports will be generated on-line and i t is impossible to predict he exact contentsof the reports, due to the variation mentioned above.
In those cases we providea rough translation on thespot.)
Second, we generate a report on-line, using an existing input table.
FinallY, we fill an input table withdata selected by those attending the demonstration, and generate a report expressing these data.
All modulesdepicted in Figure 1 are included in the demonstration.
For each 'generation round', first a plain text versionof the generated report is shown, and then the enriched text with the prosodic markers.
Finally, the system's?
speech output is played.

Due to the fact that a few phrases are missing from the phrase database, phrase concatenation is only avail-able in the first part of the demonstration.
The output from diphone synthesis available in all parts.293showing an example 'Teletext page "3 and a report hat was generated onthe basis of this page in both plainand enriched text format.
A written English translation will be provided.
We play a spoken version of thereport using both speech synthesis and phrase concatenation.The screenshot in Figure 2 shows a Teletext page and the plain ?text version of a generated report.
4 Sincethe screenshot was taken from the English language version of the web demonstration, to the right of theTeletext page we can see a translation table of the words and abbreviations occurring on the page.
Belowthis table, there is a 'Create report' button, which can be used to generate a new report on the basis of thesame Teletext page.Below the report, there are three more buttons.
Clicking the first replaces the plain text version of the reportwith the enriched text version, shown in Figure 3.
5 The other two buttons can be clicked to play the audiofiles that were created when the report was generated, using phrase concatenation a d diphone synthesis?
respectively.
The sound files can be either in aiff or in wav format.Output from language generationI/"Vite~ze ging op "bezoek bij "Ajax/I en "won met "@een H ~ "@twee/H"vijfentmintig dulzend "'toe~aouwe~ / kwaman a~ De "Meet I/I:le % "Vite~e speler "Gorter/ benutte in de "t-4taalfde "mint.nat een "penalty///in de "drieentwintigste mintrat/brncht de% "Ajax speler "Litmw~n /de teams op "gelijke "hoogte//I:le % "verdediger "Arteveld / maa.~te na "vijfenveertig minuten bet "winrm~e doelpuaat / voor "Vite~e Hen~*paalde ,:la~'mee de ?elndstimd/op "~n I I -  "@trace l/I"Grim van "Ajax / ontving een "gele "l~art \[ van "~heidsrechter "Temmink//1'vielen "geen "rode ~ ' ten  I/!Figure 3: Partial screenshot showing generated report in enriched text format}Generate a report on-line - The next step is to generate a report on-line.
We use the same Teletext page asbefore, which gives us the opportunity tO point out the variation in the generated reports.
Although the writ-ten report (including prosodic markers) is generated almost instantaneously, the fact that the sound fileshave to be created at the same time causes a small delay of about five seconds.
When the report has beengenerated and one of the speech buttons is Clicked, the corresponding sound file has already been createdand onlY has to be read.Creating a match - Finally, the web demonstration allows?
one to define the input for GoalGetter by fillingan empty input table according to one's own preferences.
We use this feature to 'create a match' using dataselected by those present at the demonstration.
On the basis of these data, a 'Teletext pag e' is created andreports can be generated in the manner explained above.In Figure 4 we can see how an input table is filled.
First, general information about he match is specified,such as the teams involved, the referee and the number of spectators.
The teams and the referee are chosenfrom a predefined list, via a pull-down menu.
After the general information has been determined, the main?

Translation: Yitesse visited Ajax and gained a 1-2 victory.
Twenty five thousand spectators came to DeMeer.
The Vitesse player Gorter kicked a penalty home in the 12th minute.
In the 23rd minute, the Ajaxplayer Litmanen leveled the score.
After 45 minutes, the defender Atteveld scored the winning goal and: thereby brought hefinal score to 1-2.
Grim from Ajax received a yellow card from refere  Temmink.
Therewere no red cards5~ In the enriched text, accents are indicated by double quotes, and intonation boundaries of differentstrengths by a number of slashes.
The symbols?
@ and % indicate specific pronunciation s for certain words.294events of the match can be specified in the 'Goals and cards' section.
This is done by selecting aplayer fromone of the teams, selecting the event his player was involved in (goal, own goal, penalty, yellow or redcard), specifying the minute the event occurred in (for cards this is optional), and then clicking on the Addbutton to add the 'event' to the input table.
This action can be repeated until an interesting match has beencreated.
Then clicking the 'Create the Teletext page' button will produce a page similar to the one shownin Figure 2, and a report can be generated.General informationHome Team Visiting Team Referee Spectators..... 1Goals and cardsde Gl-aaf~:hap Go Ahead Eaglesi A-alOverviewIf i i!

RequirementsThe GoalGetter demonstration can be run via the web.
The web browser that is used should support framesand tables.
(In the case of Netscape, this means that version 2.0 or higher is required.)
In order to make thesound files audible, a sound card must be available.
When running the demonstration a PC, wav formatshould be chosen for the sound files, while for a Unix machine aiff-format is more suitable.
The options ofthe web browser should be set so that audio files are played (e.g., using sfplay) instead of being saved to?disk.References[Van Deemter & Odijk 97] Van Deemter, K. and J. Odijk, 1997.
