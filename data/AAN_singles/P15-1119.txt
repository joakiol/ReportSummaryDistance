English).
Existing approachestypically don?t include lexical features,which are not transferable across lan-guages.
In this paper, we bridge the lex-ical feature gap by using distributed fea-ture representations and their composition.We provide two algorithms for inducingcross-lingual distributed representations ofwords, which map vocabularies from twodifferent languages into a common vectorspace.
Consequently, both lexical featuresand non-lexical features can be used in ourmodel for cross-lingual transfer.Furthermore, our framework is able to in-corporate additional useful features suchas cross-lingual word clusters.
Our com-bined contributions achieve an average rel-ative error reduction of 10.9% in labeledattachment score as compared with thedelexicalized parser, trained on Englishuniversal treebank and transferred to threeother languages.
It also significantly out-performs McDonald et al (2013) aug-mented with projected cluster features onidentical data.1 IntroductionDependency Parsing has been one of NLP?s long-standing central problems.
The majority of workon dependency parsing has been dedicated toresource-rich languages, such as English and Chi-nese.
For these languages, there exist large-scale?This work was done while the author was visiting JHU.annotated treebanks that can be used for super-vised training of dependency parsers.
However,for most of the languages in the world, there arefew or even no labeled training data for parsing,and it is labor intensive and time-consuming tomanually build treebanks for all languages.
Thisfact has given rise to a number of research on un-supervised methods (Klein and Manning, 2004),annotation projection methods (Hwa et al, 2005),and model transfer methods (McDonald et al,2011) for predicting linguistic structures.
In thisstudy, we focus on the model transfer methods,which attempt to build parsers for low-resourcelanguages by exploiting treebanks from resource-rich languages.The major obstacle in transferring a parsingsystem from one language to another is the lex-ical features, e.g.
words, which are not directlytransferable across languages.
To solve this prob-lem, McDonald et al (2011) build a delexical-ized parser - a parser that only has non-lexicalfeatures.
A delexicalized parser makes sense inthat POS tag features are significantly predic-tive for unlabeled dependency parsing.
How-ever, for labeled dependency parsing, especiallyfor semantic-oriented dependencies like Stanford-type dependencies (De Marneffe et al, 2006;De Marneffe and Manning, 2008), these non-lexical features are not predictive enough.
T?ack-str?om et al (2012) propose to learn cross-lingualword clusters from multilingual paralleled un-labeled data through word alignments, and ap-ply these clusters as features for semi-superviseddelexicalized parsing.
Word clusters can bethought as a kind of coarse-grained representa-tions of words.
Thus, this approach partially fillsthe gap of lexical features in cross-lingual learningof dependency parsing.This paper proposes a novel approach for cross-lingual dependency parsing that is based on puredistributed feature representations.
In contrast to1234the discrete lexical features used in traditional de-pendency parsers, distributed representations mapsymbolic features into a continuous representationspace, that can be shared across languages.
There-fore, our model has the ability to utilize both lexi-cal and non-lexical features naturally.
Specifically,our framework contains two primary components:?
A neural network-based dependency parser.We expect a non-linear model for depen-dency parsing in our study, because dis-tributed feature representations are shown tobe more effective in non-linear architecturesthan in linear architectures (Wang and Man-ning, 2013).
Chen and Manning (2014) pro-pose a transition-based dependency parserusing a neural network architecture, whichis simple but works well on several datasets.Briefly, this model simply replaces the pre-dictor in transition-based dependency parserwith a well-designed neural network classi-fier.
We will provide explanations for themerits of this model in Section 3, as well ashow we adapt it to the cross-lingual task.?
Cross-lingual word representation learning.The key to filling the lexical feature gap is toproject the representations of these featuresfrom different languages into a common vec-tor space, preserving the translational equiv-alence.
We will study and compare two ap-proaches of learning cross-lingual word rep-resentations in Section 4.
The first approachis robust projection, and the second approachis based on canonical correlation analysis.Both approaches are simple to implement andare scalable to large data.We evaluate our model on the universal multi-lingual treebanks (McDonald et al, 2013).
Casestudies include transferring from English to Ger-man, Spanish and French.
Experiments show thatby incorporating lexical features, the performanceof cross-lingual dependency parsing can be im-proved significantly.
By further embedding cross-lingual cluster features (T?ackstr?om et al, 2012),we achieve an average relative error reduction of10.9% in labeled attachment score (LAS), as com-pared with the delexicalized parsers.
It also signif-icantly outperforms McDonald et al (2013) aug-mented with cluster features on identical data.

We show that cross-lingual word cluster fea-tures can be effectively embedded into ourmodel, leading to significant additive im-provements.2 Background2.1 Dependency ParsingGiven an input sentence x = w0w1...wn, the goalof dependency parsing is to build a dependencytree (Figure 1), which can be denoted by d ={(h,m, l) ?
0 ?
h ?
n; 0 <m ?
n, l ?
L}.
(h,m, l)indicates a directed arc from the head word whtothe modifier wmwith a dependency label l, and Lis the label set.
The mainstream models that havebeen proposed for dependency parsing can be de-scribed as either graph-based models or transition-based models (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).Graph-based models view the parsing problemas finding the highest scoring tree from a directedgraph.
The score of a dependency tree is typi-cally factored into scores of some small structures(e.g.
arcs) depending on the order of a model.Transition-based models aim to predict a transi-tion sequence from an initial parser state to someterminal states, depending on the parsing history.This approach has a lot of interest since it is fast(linear time) and can incorporate rich non-localfeatures (Zhang and Nivre, 2011).It has been considered that simple transition-based parsing using greedy decoding and localtraining is not as accurate as graph-based parsersor transition-based parsers with beam-search and1235global training (Zhang and Clark, 2011).
Recently,Chen and Manning (2014) show that greedytransition-based parsers can be greatly improvedby using a well-designed neural network architec-ture.
This approach can be considered as a newparadigm of parsing, in that it is based on pure dis-tributed feature representations.
In this study, wechoose Chen and Manning?s architecture to buildour basic dependency parsing model.2.2 Distributed Representations for NLPIn recent years, there has been a trend in the NLPresearch community of learning distributed rep-resentations for different natural language units,from morphemes, words and phrases, to sentencesand documents.
Using distributed representations,these symbolic units are embedded into a low-dimensional and continuous space, thus it is oftenreferred to as embeddings.1In general, there are two major ways of apply-ing distributed representations to NLP tasks.
First,they can be fed into existing supervised NLP sys-tems as augmented features in a semi-supervisedmanner.
This kind of approach has been adoptedin a variety of applications (Turian et al, 2010).Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, it has beenshown that the potential of distributed representa-tions cannot be fully exploited in the generalizedlinear models which are adopted in most of the ex-isting NLP systems (Wang and Manning, 2013).One remedy is to discretize the distributed featurerepresentations, as studied in Guo et al (2014).However, we believe that a non-linear system, e.g.a neural network, is a more powerful and effec-tive solution.
Some decent progress has alreadybeen made in this paradigm of NLP on varioustasks (Collobert et al, 2011; Chen and Manning,2014; Sutskever et al, 2014).3 Transition-based Dependency Parsing:A Neural Network ArchitectureIn this section, we first briefly describe transition-based dependency parsing and the arc-standardparsing algorithm.
Then we revisit the neural net-work architecture for transition-based dependencyparsing proposed by Chen and Manning (2014).As discussed in Section 2.1, transition-basedparsing aims to predict a transition sequence froman initial parser state to the terminal state.
Eachstate is conventionally regarded as a configuration,1In this paper, these two terms are used interchangeably.Words POS tags Arc labelsEmbeddingsTransition actionsROOT    has_VBZ good_JJ control_NN ._.He_PRPnsubjConfigurationStack BufferHidden units??

The Cluster features are introduced inSection 5.2.which typically consists of a stack S, a buffer B,and a partially derived forest, i.e.
a set of depen-dency arcs A.
Given an input word sequence x =w1w2, ...,wn, the initial configuration can be rep-resented as a tuple: ?
[w0]S, [w1w2, ...,wn]B,?
?,and the terminal configuration is ?
[w0]S, []B,A?,where w0is a pseudo word indicating the rootof the whole dependency tree.
We consider thearc-standard algorithm (Nivre, 2004) in this pa-per, which defines three types of transition actions:LEFT-ARC(l), RIGHT-ARC(l), and SHIFT, l is thedependency label.The typical approach for greedy arc-standardparsing is to build a multi-class classifier (e.g.,SVM, MaxEnt) of predicting the transition ac-tion given a feature vector extracted from a spe-cific configuration.
While conventional featureengineering suffers from the problem of sparsity,incompleteness and expensive feature computa-tion (Chen and Manning, 2014), the neural net-work model provides a potential solution.The architecture of the neural network-baseddependency parsing model is illustrated in Fig-ure 2.
Primarily, three types of information areextracted from a configuration in Chen and Man-ning?s model: word features, POS features and la-bel features respectively.
In this study, we add dis-tance features indicating the distance between twoitems, and valency features indicating the num-ber of children for a given item (Zhang and Nivre,1236Word featuresEwSi,EwBi, i = 0,1,2Ewlc1(Si),Ewrc1(Si),Ewlc2(Si),Ewrc2(Si), i = 0,1Ewlc1(lc1(Si)),Ewrc1(rc1(Si)), i = 0,1POS featuresEtSi,EtBi, i = 0,1,2Etlc1(Si),Etrc1(Si),Etlc2(Si),Etrc2(Si), i = 0,1Etlc1(lc1(Si)),Etrc1(rc1(Si)), i = 0,1Label featuresEllc1(Si),Elrc1(Si),Ellc2(Si),Elrc2(Si), i = 0,1Ellc1(lc1(Si)),Elrc1(rc1(Si)), i = 0,1Distance: Ed?S0,S1?,Ed?S0,B0?Valency: ElvS0,ElvS1,ErvS1Table 1: Feature templates of the neural networkparsing model.

Siand Birefer to the ithelements respec-tively in the stack and buffer.2011).
All of these features are projected to an em-bedding layer via corresponding embedding matri-ces, which will be estimated through the trainingprocess.
The complete feature templates used inour system are shown in Table 1.
Then, featurecompositions are performed at the hidden layer viaa cube activation function: g(x) = x3.The cube activation function can be viewed asa special case of low-rank tensor.
Formally, g(x)can be expanded as:g(w1x1+ ... +wmxm+ b) =?i,j,k(wiwjwk)xixjxk+?i,jb(wiwj)xixj+ ...If we treat the bias term as b ?
x0where x0=1, then the weight corresponding to each featurecombination xixjxkis wiwjwk, which is exactlythe same as a rank-1 component tensor in the low-rank form using CP tensor decomposition (Caoand Khudanpur, 2014).
Consequently, the cubeactivation function implicitly derives full featurecombinations.
An advantage of the cube activa-tion function is that it is flexible for adding extrafeatures to the input.
In fact, we can add as manyfeatures as possible to the input layer to improvethe parsing accuracy.
We will show in Section 5.2that the Brown cluster features can be readily in-corporated into our model.Cross-lingual Transfer.
The idea of cross-lingual transfer using the parser we examinedabove is straightforward.
In contrast to tradi-tional approaches that have to discard rich lexicalfeatures (delexicalizing) when transferring mod-els from one language to another, our model canbe transferred using the full model trained on thesource language side, i.e.
English.Since the non-lexical feature (POS, label, dis-tance, valency) embeddings are directly transfer-able between languages,2the key component ofthis framework is the cross-lingual learning of lex-ical feature embeddings, i.e.
word embeddings.Once the cross-lingual word embeddings are in-duced, we first learn a dependency parser at thesource language side.
After that, the parser will bedirectly used for parsing target language data.4 Cross-lingual Word RepresentationLearningPrior to introducing our approaches for cross-lingual word representation learning, we brieflyreview the basic model for learning monolingualword embeddings, which constitutes a subproce-dure of the cross-lingual approaches.4.1 Continuous Bag-of-Words ModelVarious approaches have been studied for learn-ing word embeddings from large-scale plaintexts.
In this study, we consider the ContinuousBag-of-Words (CBOW) model (Mikolov et al,2013) as implemented in the open-source toolkitword2vec.3The basic principle of the CBOWmodel is to predict each individual word in a se-quence given the bag of its context words within afixed window size as input, using a log-linear clas-sifier.
This model avoids the non-linear transfor-mation in hidden layers, and hence can be trainedwith high efficiency.With large window size, grouped words us-ing the resulting word embeddings are more topi-cally similar; whereas with small window size, thegrouped words will be more syntactically similar.So we set the window size to 1 in our parsing task.Next, we introduce our approach for inducingbilingual word embeddings.
In general, we ex-pect our bilingual word embeddings to preservetranslational equivalences.
For example, ?cook-ing?
(English) should be close to its translation:?kochen?
(German) in the embedding space.2POS tags are language-independent here since we use theuniversal POS tags (Section 5).3http://code.google.com/p/word2vec/12374.2 Robust Alignment-based ProjectionOur first method for inducing cross-lingual wordembeddings has two stages.
First, we learn wordembeddings from a source language (S) corporaas in the monolingual case, and then project themonolingual word embeddings to a target lan-guage (T), based on word alignments.Given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus D,we first conduct unsupervised bidirectional wordalignment, and then collect an alignment dictio-nary.
Specifically, in each word-aligned sentencepair of D, we keep all alignments with condi-tional alignment probability exceeding a thresh-old ?
= 0.95 and discard the others.
Specifically,let AT ?S = {(wTi,wSj, ci,j), i = 1,2, ...,NT; j =1,2, ...,NS} be the alignment dictionary, whereci,jis the number of times when the ithtarget wordwTiis aligned to the jthsource word wSj.
NSandNTare vocabulary sizes.
We use the shorthand(i, j) ?
AT ?S to denote a word pair in AT ?S .
Theprojection can be formalized as the weighted aver-age of the embeddings of translation words:v(wTi) = ?
(i,j)?AT ?Sci,jci,??
v(wSj) (1)where ci,?
= ?jci,j , v(w) is the embedding of w.Obviously, the simple projection method hasone drawback, it only assigns word embeddingsfor those target language words that occur in theword aligned data, which is typically smaller thanthe monolingual datasets.
Therefore, in order toimprove the robustness of projection, we utilizea morphology-inspired mechanism, to propagateembeddings from in-vocabulary words to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
Specifically, for eachOOV word wToov, we extract a list of candidatewords that is similar to it in terms of edit distance,and then set the averaged vector as the embeddingof wToov.
Formally,v(wToov) = Avgw??C(v(w?
))where C = {w?EditDist(wToov,w) ?

For two multidimensional vari-ables, CCA aims to find two projection matrices tomap the original variables to a new basis (lower-dimensional), such that the correlation betweenthe two variables is maximized.Let?s treat CCA as a blackbox here, and see howto apply CCA for inducing bilingual word embed-dings.

English andGerman): ?

However, one potential limita-tion is that CCA assumes linear transformation ofword embeddings, which is difficult to satisfy.4AT ?S is also worth trying, but we observed slight perfor-mance degradation in our experimental setting.1238Note that both approaches can be generalizeto lower-resource languages where parallel bitextsare not available.
In that way, the dictionary A canbe readily obtained either using bilingual lexiconinduction approaches (Koehn and Knight, 2002;Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Haghighi et al, 2008),or from resources like Wiktionary5and Panlex.65 Experiments5.1 Data and SettingsFor the pre-training of word embeddings, we usethe WMT-2011 monolingual news corpora for En-glish, German and Spanish.7For French, wecombined the WMT-2011 and WMT-2012 mono-lingual news corpora.8We obtained the wordalignment counts using the fast-align toolkit incdec (Dyer et al, 2010) from the parallel newscommentary corpora (WMT 2006-10) combinedwith the Europarl corpus for English-{German,Spanish, French}.9For the training of the neural network depen-dency parser, we set the number of hidden units to400.

The dimensions ofthe monolingual embeddings (d1, d2) and the re-sulting bilingual embeddings are set to 50 equally.We employ the universal dependency treebanksproposed by McDonald et al (2013) for a reli-able evaluation of our approach for cross-lingualdependency parsing.
The universal multilingualtreebanks are annotated using the universal POStagset (Petrov et al, 2011) which contains 12 POStags, as well as the universal dependencies whichcontains 42 relations.
We follow the standard splitof the treebanks for every language (DE, ES, andFR).105https://www.wiktionary.org/6http://panlex.org/7http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/8http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/9http://www.statmt.org/europarl/10http://code.google.com/p/uni-dep-tb/.5.2 Baseline SystemsWe compare our approach with three systems.
Forthe first baseline, we evaluate the delexicalizedtransfer of our parser [DELEX], in which we onlyuse non-lexical features.We also compare our approach with the delexi-calized parser in McDonald et al (2013) [McD13],who used a perceptron-trained transition-basedparser with a beam of size 8, along with rich non-local features (Zhang and Nivre, 2011).Furthermore, we augment cross-lingual wordclusters to the perceptron-based delexicalizedparser, as proposed in T?ackstr?om et al (2012).
Weuse the same alignment dictionary as described inSection 4 to induce the cross-lingual word clus-ters.
We re-implement the PROJECTED clusterapproach in T?ackstr?om et al (2012), which assignsa target word to the cluster with which it is mostoften aligned:c(wTi) = arg maxk?
(i,j)?AT ?Sci,j?
1[c(wSj) = k]This method also has the drawback that words thatdo not occur in the alignment dictionary (OOV)cannot be assigned a cluster.
Therefore, we usethe same strategy as described in Section 4.2 tofind the most likely clusters for the OOV words.Instead of the clustering model of Uszkoreit andBrants (2008), we use Brown clustering (Brownet al, 1992) to induce hierarchical word clusters,where each word is represented as a bit-string.We use the same word cluster feature templatesfrom T?ackstr?om et al (2012), and set the numberof Brown clusters to 256.5.3 Experimental ResultsAll of the parsing models are trained using the de-velopment data from English for early-stopping.Table 3 lists the results of the cross-lingual trans-fer experiments for dependency parsing.
Table 4further summarizes each of the experimental gainsdetailed in Table 3.Our delexicalized system obtains slightly lowerperformance than those reported in McDonaldet al (2013) (McD13), because we?re usingBefore this dataset was carried out, the CoNLL multilingualdependency treebanks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) wereoften used for evaluation.
However, the major problem isthat the dependency annotations vary for different languages(e.g.
the choice of lexical versus functional head), whichmakes it impossible to evaluate the LAS.1239Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) Labeled Attachment Score (LAS)EN DE ES FR AVG EN DE ES FR AVGDELEX 83.67 57.01 68.05 68.85 64.64 79.42 47.12 56.99 57.78 53.96PROJ 91.96 60.07 71.42 71.36 67.62 90.48 49.94 61.76 61.55 57.75PROJ+Cluster 92.33 60.35 71.90 72.93 68.39 90.91 51.54 62.28 63.12 58.98CCA 90.62?59.42 68.87 69.58 65.96 88.88?49.32 59.65 59.50 56.16CCA+Cluster 92.03?60.66 71.33 70.87 67.62 90.49?51.29 61.69 61.50 58.16MCD13 83.33 58.50 68.07 70.14 65.57 78.54 48.11 56.86 58.20 54.39MCD13?84.44 57.30 68.15 69.91 65.12 80.30 47.34 57.12 58.80 54.42MCD13?+Cluster 90.21 60.55 70.43 72.01 67.66 88.28 50.20 60.96 61.96 57.71Table 3: Cross-lingual transfer dependency parsing from English on the test dataset of 4 universal multi-lingual treebanks.

All gains are sta-tistically significant using MaltEval at p < 0.01.12greedy decoding and local training.
Our re-implementation of (McDonald et al, 2013) attainscomparable performance with MCD13.For all languages we consider in this study, byusing cross-lingual word embeddings either fromalignment-based projection or CCA, we obtainstatistically significant improvements against thedelexicalized system, both in UAS and LAS.Interestingly, we notice that PROJ consistentlyperforms better than CCA by a significant margin,and is comparable to McD13?+Cluster.
We willgive further analysis to this observation in Sec-tion 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.Our framework is flexible for incorporatingricher features simply by embedding them intocontinuous vectors.
Thus we further embed thecross-lingual word cluster features into our model,together with the proposed cross-lingual word em-beddings.
The cluster feature template used hereis similar to the POS tag feature templates:Cluster featuresEcSi,EcBi, i = 0,1,2Eclc1(Si),Ecrc1(Si),Eclc2(Si),Ecrc2(Si), i = 0,1Eclc1(lc1(Si)),Ecrc1(rc1(Si)), i = 0,1Table 5: Word cluster feature templates.As shown in Table 3, additive improvements areobtained for both PROJ and CCA.
Compared withour delexicalized system, the relative error is re-duced by up to 13.1% in UAS, and up to 12.6% inLAS.
The combined system further outperformsMcD13?augmented with cluster features signifi-cantly .5.3.1 Effect of Robust ProjectionSince in both PROJ and the induction of cross-lingual word clusters, we use edit distance mea-sure for OOV words, we would like to see howthis affects the performance of parsing.Intuitively, higher coverage of projected wordsin the test dataset should promote the parsing per-formance more.
To verify this, we further con-duct experiments under both settings using thePROJ+Cluster model.
Results are shown in Ta-ble 6.
Improvements are observed for all lan-guages when using robust projection with edit dis-tance measure, especially for FR, where the high-est coverage gain is obtained by robust projection.5.3.2 Fine-tuning of Word EmbeddingsAnother reason for the effectiveness of PROJ overCCA lies in the fine-tuning of word embeddingswhile training the parser.1240Simple Robust ?DEcoverage 91.37 94.70 +3.33UAS 59.74 60.35 +0.61LAS 50.84 51.54 +0.70EScoverage 94.51 96.67 +2.16UAS 70.97 71.90 +0.93LAS 61.34 62.28 +0.94FRcoverage 90.83 97.60 +6.77UAS 71.17 72.93 +1.76LAS 61.72 63.12 +1.40Table 6: Effect of robust projection.CCA can be viewed as a joint method for in-ducing cross-lingual word embeddings.
Whentraining the source language dependency parserwith cross-lingual word embeddings derived fromCCA, the EN word embeddings should be fixed.Otherwise, the translational equivalence will bebroken.
However, for PROJ, there is no such limi-tation.
Word embeddings can be updated as othernon-lexical feature embeddings, in order to obtaina more accurate dependency parser.
We refer tothis procedure as a fine-tuning process to the wordembeddings.
To verify the benefits of fine-tuning,we conduct experiments to see relative loss if wordembeddings are fixed while training.
Results areshown in Table 7, which indicates that fine-tuningindeed offers considerable help.Fix Fine-tune ?DEUAS 59.74 60.07 +0.33LAS 49.44 49.94 +0.50ESUAS 70.10 71.42 +1.32LAS 61.31 61.76 +0.45FRUAS 70.65 71.36 +0.71LAS 60.69 61.50 +0.81Table 7: Effect of fine-tuning word embeddings.5.4 Compare with Existing Bilingual WordEmbeddingsIn this section, we compare our bilingual em-beddings with several previous approaches in thecontext of dependency parsing.
To the best ofour knowledge, this is the first work on eval-uation of bilingual word embeddings in syntac-tic tasks.
The approaches we consider includethe multi-task learning approach (Klementiev etal., 2012) [MTL], the bilingual auto-encoder ap-proach (Chandar et al, 2014) [BIAE], the bilingualcompositional vector model (Hermann and Blun-som, 2014) [BICVM], and the bilingual bag-of-words approach (Gouws et al, 2014) [BILBOWA].For MTL and BIAE, we adopt their releasedword embeddings directly due to the inefficiencyof training.13For BICVM and BILBOWA, we re-run their systems on the same dataset as our pre-vious experiments.14Results are summarized inTable 8.
CCA and PROJ consistently outperformsall other approaches in all languages, and PROJperforms the best.
The inferior performance ofMTL and BIAE is partly due to the low wordcoverage.
For example, they cover only 31% ofwords in the universal DE test treebank, whereasthe CCA and PROJ covers over 70%.
Moreover,BIAE, BICVM and BILBOWA are optimized usingsemantic-related objectives.
So we suggest thatthey are probably not well fit for syntactic tasks.It is worth noting that we don?t assume/requirebilingual parallel data in CCA and PROJ.
Whatwe need in practice is a bilingual lexicon for eachpaired languages.
This is especially importantfor generalizing our approaches to lower-resourcelanguages, where parallel texts are not available.6 Related StudiesExisting approaches for cross-lingual dependencyparsing can be divided into three categories: cross-lingual annotation projection methods, jointlymodeling methods and cross-lingual representa-tion learning methods.The cross-lingual annotation projection methodis first proposed in Yarowsky et al (2001) for shal-lower NLP tasks (POS tagging, NER, etc.).
Thecentral idea is to project the syntactic annotationsfrom a resource-rich language to the target lan-guage through word alignments, and then train asupervised parser on the projected noisy annota-tions (Hwa et al, 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009;Zhao et al, 2009; Jiang et al, 2011; Tiedemann,2014; Tiedemann, 2015).
Noises and errors intro-duced by the word alignment and annotation pro-jection processes can be reduced with robust pro-jection methods by using graph-based label propa-gation (Das and Petrov, 2011; Kim and Lee, 2012),or by incorporating auxiliary resources (Kim et al,2012; Khapra et al, 2010).The jointly modeling methods integrates themonolingual grammar induction with bilingually-projected dependency information (Liu et al,2013), or linguistic constraints via posterior13The MTL embeddings are normalized before training.14BICVM only uses the bilingual parallel dataset.1241DE ES FRUAS LAS UAS LAS UAS LASMTL (Klementiev et al, 2012)?57.70 47.13 68.04 58.78 67.66 57.30BIAE (Chandar et al, 2014)?53.74 43.68 58.81 46.66 60.10 49.47BICVM (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014) 56.30 46.99 67.78 58.08 69.13 58.13BILBOWA (Gouws et al, 2014) 51.65 41.83 65.02 54.35 63.35 51.65CCA 59.42 49.32 68.87 59.65 69.58 59.50PROJ 60.07 49.94 71.42 61.76 71.36 61.55Table 8: Comparison with existing bilingual word embeddings.
?For MTL and BIAE, we use theirreleased bilingual word embeddings.regularization (Ganchev et al, 2009), manu-ally constructed universal dependency parsingrules (Naseem et al, 2010) and manually spec-ified typological features (Naseem et al, 2012).Besides dependency parsing, the joint modelingmethod has also been applied for other multi-lingual NLP tasks, including NER (Che et al,2013; Wang and Manning, 2014), SRL (Zhuangand Zong, 2010; Titov and Klementiev, 2012) andWSD (Guo and Diab, 2010).The cross-lingual representation learningmethod aims at building connections acrossdifferent languages by inducing language-independent feature representations.
After that, aparser can be trained at the source-language sidewithin the induced feature space, and directly beapplied to the target language.
Typical approachesinclude cross-lingual word clustering (T?ackstr?omet al, 2012) which is employed in this paper as abaseline, projection features (Durrett et al, 2012).Xiao and Guo (2014) learns cross-lingual wordembeddings and apply them with MSTParser forlinguistic transfer, which inspires this work.It is worth mentioning that remarkable re-sults on the universal dependency treebanks havebeen achieved by using annotation projectionmethod (Tiedemann, 2014), treebank translationmethod (Tiedemann and Nivre, 2014), and distri-bution transferring method (Ma and Xia, 2014).Unlike our approach, all of these methods in-volve training a parser at the target language side.Parallel bitexts are required in these methods,which limits their scalability to lower-resourcelanguages.
That said, these methods have the ad-vantage that they are capable of capturing somelanguage-specific syntactic patterns which our ap-proach cannot.15These two kinds of approaches15For example, in Spanish and French, adjectives often ap-pears after nouns, thus forming a right-directed arc labeledby amod, whereas in English, the amod arcs are mostly left-directed.are complementary, and can be integrated to pushthe performance further.7 ConclusionThis paper proposes a novel framework based ondistributed representations for cross-lingual de-pendency parsing.
Two algorithms are proposedfor the induction of cross-lingual word represen-tations: robust projection and CCA, which bridgethe lexical feature gap.Experiments show that by using cross-lingualword embeddings derived from either approach,the transferred parsing performance can be im-proved significantly against the delexicalized sys-tem.
A notable observation is that our projectionmethod performs significantly better than CCA,a joint method.
Additionally, our framework isflexibly able to incorporate the cross-lingual wordcluster features, with further significant gains ineach use.
The combined system significantlyoutperforms the delexicalized system on all lan-guages, by an average of 10.9% error reductionon LAS, and further significantly outperforms Mc-Donald et al (2013) augmented with projectedcluster features.16AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Manaal Faruqui for providingthe bilingual resources.
