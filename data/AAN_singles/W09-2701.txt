andVicedo, 2007; Ferret and Zweigenbaum,2007).
On the one hand, knowledge andreasoning may be more necessary thanin open-domain question-answering be-cause of more specific or more difficultquestions.
On the other hand, it mayalso be more manageable, since by def-inition restricted-domain QA should nothave to face the same breadth of ques-tions as open-domain QA.
It is thereforeinteresting to study the role of knowl-edge and reasoning in restricted-domainquestion-answering systems.
We shall doso in the case of the (bio-)medical domain,which has a long tradition of investigat-ing knowledge representation and reason-ing and, more generally, artificial intel-ligence methods (Shortliffe et al, 1975),and which has seen a growing interestin question-answering systems (Zweigen-baum, 2003; Yu et al, 2005; Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Zweigenbaum etal., 2007).1 Knowledge and Reasoning forProcessing Medical QuestionsMedical question-answering has to address ques-tions other than the usual factual questions of mostQA evaluations.
This calls for different questionclassifications (Ely et al, 2000; Yu et al, 2005),especially to determine whether a given ques-tion can be answered using medical knowledgebacked with a sufficient level of evidence (Lin andDemner-Fushman, 2005; Kilicoglu et al, 2009).This can also lead to a different representation ofquestions, for instance using a structured represen-tation such as PICO (Niu et al, 2003; Huang et al,2006; Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007) or simpleconcepts and relations (Lin, 2001; Jacquemart andZweigenbaum, 2003).2 Knowledge and Reasoning for FindingMedical AnswersAnswers to medical questions should be searchedin the most reliable data available.
When data existin structured knowledge bases (e.g.
a drug com-pendium), it may be more appropriate to querysuch knowledge bases directly.
Therefore an ap-proach akin to that of Start/Omnibase (Lin andKatz, 2003) may be indicated.
When answers areto be found in a collection of documents, as is thecase in traditional question-answering systems,a representation of the information contained inthese documents can be built, offline (Fleischmanet al, 2003; Sang et al, 2005; Delbecque et al,2005) or dynamically.In medical QA systems, both document anal-ysis and question analysis nearly always rely onextensive knowledge of domain concepts and re-lations, e.g.
as provided by the UMLS knowl-edge sources (McCray and Nelson, 1995).
Morethan named entities, systems need to detect men-tions of concepts (Aronson, 2001) and their rela-tions (Rindflesch et al, 2005).
Besides, taking intoaccount the structure of documents such as sci-entific articles or encyclopedia entries may helpfocus on more relevant sections (Niu and Hirst,2004; Sang et al, 2005).
Finally, answers to com-plex medical questions often need to span morethan one sentence.
Extractive summarization isperformed both from single documents (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007) and from multiple docu-ments (Fiszman et al, 2008).1ReferencesAlan R. Aronson.
