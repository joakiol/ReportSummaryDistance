Workshop on Information Discovery in Text, pages 19?24,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Proposition Knowledge GraphsGabriel Stanovsky Omer Levy Ido DaganComputer Science Department, Bar-Ilan University{gabriel.satanovsky, omerlevy}@gmail.comdagan@cs.biu.ac.ilAbstractOpen Information Extraction (Open IE) is a promising approach for unrestricted InformationDiscovery (ID).
While Open IE is a highly scalable approach, allowing unsupervised relationextraction from open domains, it currently has some limitations.
First, it lacks the expressivenessneeded to properly represent and extract complex assertions that are abundant in text.
Second, itdoes not consolidate the extracted propositions, which causes simple queries above Open IE as-sertions to return insufficient or redundant information.
To address these limitations, we proposein this position paper a novel representation for ID ?
Propositional Knowledge Graphs (PKG).PKGs extend the Open IE paradigm by representing semantic inter-proposition relations in atraversable graph.
We outline an approach for constructing PKGs from single and multiple texts,and highlight a variety of high-level applications that may leverage PKGs as their underlyinginformation discovery and representation framework.1 IntroductionInformation discovery from text (ID) aims to provide a consolidated and explorable data representation ofan input document or a collection of documents addressing a common topic.
Ideally, this representationwould separate the input into logically discrete units, omit redundancies in the original text, and providesemantic relations between the basic units of the representation.
This representation can then be usedby human readers as a convenient and succinct format, or by subsequent NLP tasks (such as questionanswering and multidocument summarization) as a structured input representation.A common approach to ID is to extract propositions conveyed in the text by applying either supervisedInformation Extraction (IE) techniques (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996), to recover propositions covering apredefined set of relations (Auer et al., 2007; Suchanek et al., 2008), or more recently, Open InformationExtraction (Open IE) (Etzioni et al., 2008), which discovers open-domain relations (Zhu et al., 2009;Wu et al., 2008).
In Open IE, natural language propositions are extracted from text, based on surfaceor syntactic patterns, and are then represented as predicate-argument tuples, where each element is anatural language string.
While Open IE presents a promising direction for ID, thanks to its robustnessand scalability across domains, we argue that it currently lacks representation power in two major aspects:representing complex propositions extracted from discourse, such as interdependent propositions orimplicitly conveyed propositions, and consolidating propositions extracted across multiple sources,which leads to either insufficient or redundant information when exploring a set of Open IE extractions.In this position paper we outline Propositional Knowledge Graphs (PKG), a representation whichaddresses both of Open IE?s mentioned drawbacks.
The graph?s nodes are discrete propositions extractedfrom text, and edges are drawn where semantic relations between propositions exists.
Such relations canbe inferred from a single discourse, or from multiple text fragments along with background knowledge ?by applying methods such as textual entailment recognition (Dagan et al., 2013) ?
which consolidates theinformation within the graph.
We discuss this representation as a useful input for semantic applications,and describe work we have been doing towards implementing such a framework.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

The dashed boundaries in the figure denote paraphrase cliques, meaning that all propositions within themare mutually entailing.
Some of these propositions are complex, and the bottom-right corner illustrates how one of them can berepresented by inter-connected sub-propositions.2 Approach: Discover Inter-Proposition RelationsWe propose a novel approach for textual information discovery and representation that enhances theexpressiveness of Open IE with structural power similar to traditional knowledge graphs.
Our represen-tation aims to extract all the information conveyed by text to a traversable graph format ?
a PropositionalKnowledge Graph (PKG).
The graph?s nodes are natural language propositions and its labeled edges aresemantic relations between these propositions.
Figure 1 illustrates an excerpt of a PKG.We separate the construction of such graphs into two phases, each of which addresses one of the afore-mentioned limitations of current Open IE.
The first phase (described in section 2.1) is the extraction ofcomplex propositions from a single discourse.
This phase extends upon the definition of Open IE ex-tractions to gain a more expressive paradigm and improve the recall of extracted propositions.
In thisextension, a single assertion is represented by a set of interconnected propositions.
An example can beseen in the bottom right of Figure 1.
The second phase (described in section 2.2) deals with the consolida-tion of propositions extracted in the first phase.
This is done by drawing relations such as entailment andtemporal succession between these propositions, which can be inferred utilizing background knowledgeapplied on multiple text fragments.2.1 Relations Implied by DiscourseCurrent Open IE representation schemes lack the expressibility to represent certain quite common propo-sitions implied by syntax, hindering Open IE?s potential as an information discovery framework.
We dis-cuss several cases in which this limitation is evident, and describe possible solutions within our proposedframework.Embedded and Interrelated Propositions Common Open IE systems retrieve only propositions inwhich both predicates and arguments are instantiated in succession in the surface form.
For such propo-sitions, these systems produce independent tuples (typically a (subject, verb, object) triplet) consisting ofa predicate and a list of its arguments, all expressed in natural language, in the same way they originallyappeared in the sentence.
This methodology lacks the ability to represent cases in which propositions areinherently embedded, such as conditionals and propositional arguments (e.g.
?Senator Kennedy askedcongress to pass the bill?).
Mausam et al.
(2012) introduced a context analysis layer, extending this20representation with an additional field per tuple, which intends to represent the factuality of the extrac-tion, accounting specifically for cases of conditionals and attribution.
For instance, the assertion ?If hewins five key states, Romney will be elected President?
will be represented as ((Romney; will be elected;President) ClausalModifier if; he wins five key states).While these methods capture some of the propositions conveyed by text, they fail to retrieve otherpropositions expressed by more sophisticated syntactic constructs.
Consider the sentence from Figure 1?Curiosity will look for evidence that Mars might have had conditions for supporting life?.
It exhibits aconstruction which the independent tuples format seems to fall short from representing.
Our proposedrepresentation for this sentence is depicted in the bottom right of Figure 1.
We represent the complexityof the sentence through a nested structure of interlinked propositions, each composed of a single pred-icate and its syntactic arguments and modifiers.
In addition, we model certain syntactic variabilities asfeatures, such as tense, negation, passive voice, etc.
Thus, a single assertion is represented through thediscrete propositions it conveys, along with their inter-relations.
In addition to the expressibility that thisrepresentation offers, an immediate gain is the often recurring case in which a part of a proposition (forexample, one of the arguments) immediately implies another proposition.
For instance, ?The Mars roverCuriosity is a mobile science lab?
implies that ?Curiosity is a rover?, and does so syntactically.Implicit propositions Certain propositions which are conveyed by the text are not explicitly expressedin the surface form.
Consider, for instance, the sentence ?Facebook?s acquisition of WhatsApp occurredyesterday?.
It introduces the proposition (Facebook, acquired, WhatsApp) through nominalization.
Cur-rent Open IE formalisms are unable to extract such triplets, since the necessary predicate (namely ?ac-quired?)
does not appear in the surface form.
Implicit propositions might be introduced in many otherlinguistic constructs, such as: appositions (?The company, Random House, doesn?t report its earnings.
?implies that Random House is a company), adjectives (?Tall John walked home?
implies that John is tall),and possessives (?John?s book is on the table?
implies that John has a book).
We intend to syntacticallyidentify these implicit propositions, and make them explicit in our representation.For further analysis of syntax-driven proposition representation, see our recent work (Stanovsky et al.,2014).
We believe that this extension of Open IE representation is feasibly extractable from syntacticparse trees, and are currently working on automatic conversion from Stanford dependencies (de Marneffeand Manning, 2008) to interconnected propositions as described.2.2 Consolidating Information across PropositionsWhile Open IE is indeed much more scalable than supervised approaches, it does not consolidate natu-ral language expressions, which leads to either insufficient or redundant information when accessing arepository of Open IE extractions.
As an illustrating example, querying the University of Washington?sOpen IE demo (openie.cs.washington.edu) for the generally equivalent relieves headache ortreats headache returns two different lists of entities; out of the top few results, the only answers thesequeries seem to agree on are caffeine and sex.
Desirably, an information discovery platform should re-turn identical results (or at least very similar ones) to these queries.
This is a major drawback relativeto supervised knowledge representations, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), which map naturallanguage expressions to canonical formal representations (e.g.
the treatments relation in Freebase).While much relational information can be salvaged from the original text, many inter-propositionalrelations stem from background knowledge and our understanding of language.
Perhaps the most promi-nent of these is the entailment relation, as demonstrated in Figure 1.
We rely on the definition of textualentailment as defined by Dagan et al.
(2013): proposition T entails proposition H if humans reading Twould typically infer that H is most likely true.
Entailment provides an effective structure for aggregat-ing natural-language based information; it merges semantically equivalent propositions into cliques, andinduces specification-generalization edges between them (if T entails H , then H is more general).Figure 1 demonstrates the usefulness of entailment in organizing the propositions within a PKG.
Forexample, the two statements describing Curiosity as a mobile science lab (middle right) originated fromtwo different texts.
However, in a PKG, they are marked as paraphrases (mutually entailing), and bothentail an additional proposition from a third source: ?Curiosity is a lab?.
If one were to query all the21propositions that entail ?Curiosity is a lab?
?
e.g.
in response to the query ?What is Curiosity??
?
allthree propositions would be retrieved, even though their surface forms may have ?functions as?
insteadof ?is?
or ?laboratory?
instead of ?lab?.We have recently taken some first steps in this direction, investigating algorithms for constructingentailment edges over sets of related propositions (Levy et al., 2014).
Even between simple propositions,recognizing entailment is challenging.
We are currently working on new methods that will leveragestructured and unstructured data to recognize entailment for Open IE propositions.
There are additionalrelations, besides entailment, that should desirably be represented in PKGs as well.
Two such examplesare temporal relations (depicted in Figure 1) and causality.
Investigating and adapting methods forrecognizing and utilizing these relations is intended for future work.3 ApplicationsAn appealing application of knowledge graphs is question answering (QA).
In this section we demon-strate how our representation may facilitate more sophisticated information access scenarios.Structured Queries Queries over structured data give the user the power to receive targeted answersfor her queries.
Consider for example the query ?electric cars on sale in Canada?.
PKGs can give thepower of queries over structured data to the domain of unstructured information.
To answer our query,we can search the PKG for all of the propositions that entail these two propositions: (1) ?X is an electriccar?, (2) ?X is on sale in Canada?, where X is a variable.
The list of X instantiations is the answerto our structured query.
Our knowledge structure enables even more sophisticated queries that involvemore than one variable.
For example, ?Japanese corporations that bought Australian start-ups?
retrievesa collection of pairs (X,Y ) where X is the Japanese corporation that bought Y , an Australian start-up.Summarization Multi-document summarization gives the user the ability to compactly assimilate in-formation from multiple documents on the same topic.
PKGs can be a natural platform leveraged bysummarization because: (1) they would contain the information from those documents as fine-grainedpropositions (2) they represent the semantic relations between those propositions.
These semantic re-lations can be leveraged to create high-quality summarizations.
For example, the paraphrase (mutualentailment) relation prevents redundancy.
Links of a temporal or causal nature can also dictate the orderin which each proposition is presented.
A recent method of summarizing text with entailment graphs(Gupta et al., 2014) demonstrates the appeal and feasibility of this application.Faceted Search Faceted search allows a user to interactively navigate a PKG.
Adler et al.
(2012)demonstrate this concept on a limited proposition graph.
When searching for ?headache?
in their demo,the user can drill-down to find possible causes or remedies, and even focus on subcategories of those;for example, finding the foods which relieve headaches.
As opposed to the structured query application,retrieval is not fully automated, but rather interactive.
It thus allows users to explore and discover newinformation they might not have considered a-priori.4 DiscussionIn this position paper we outlined a framework for information discovery that leverages and extends OpenIE, while addressing two of its current major drawbacks.
The proposed framework enriches Open IE byrepresenting natural language in a traversable graph, composed of propositions and their semantic inter-relations ?
A Propositional Knowledge Graph (PKG).
The resulting structure provides a representationin two levels: locally, at sentence level, by representing the syntactic proposition structure embedded in asingle sentence, and globally, at inter-proposition level, where relations are drawn between propositionsfrom discourse, or from various sources.At the sentence level, PKG can be compared to Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescuet al., 2013), which maps a sentence onto a hierarchical structure of propositions (predicate-argumentrelations) - a ?meaning representation?.
AMR uses Propbank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003) for pred-icates?
meaning representation, where possible, and ungrounded natural language, where no respective22Propbank lexicon entry exists.
While AMR relies on a deep semantic interpretation, our sentence levelrepresentation is more conservative (and thus, hopefully, more feasible) and can be obtained by syntacticinterpretation.At inter-proposition level, PKG can be compared with traditional Knowledge Graphs (such as Freebaseand Google?s Knowledge Graph).
These Knowledge Graphs, in contrast with PKGs, require manualintervention and aim to cover a rich set of relations using formal language and a pre-specified schema,thus many relations are inevitably left out (e.g.
the relation cracked, as in (Alan Turing, cracked, theEnigma) does not exist in Freebase).We believe that PKGs are a promising extension of Open IE?s unsupervised traits, for combining as-pects of information representation - on a local scale, providing a rich schema for representing sentences,and on a global scale providing an automated and consolidated method for structuring knowledge.ReferencesMeni Adler, Jonathan Berant, and Ido Dagan.
