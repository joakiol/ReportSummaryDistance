It is now considered to be fundamental for many natural language processing tasks suchas information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and question answering.This paper presents a workflow to build an English-Vietnamese named entity corpus from analigned bilingual corpus.
The workflow is based on a state of the art named entity recognitiontool to identify English named entities and map them into Vietnamese text.
The paper alsopresents a detailed discussion about several mapping errors and differences between English andVietnamese sentences that affect this task.1 IntroductionNamed entity recognition (NER) is a basic task in natural language processing and one of the mostimportant subtasks in Information Extraction.
It is really essential to identify objects and extract relationsbetween them.
Moreover, recognizing proper names from news articles or newswires is also useful indetecting events and monitoring them.
The NER task aims to identify and classify certain proper nounsinto some pre-defined target entity classes such as person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC),temporal expressions (TIME), monetary values (MON), and percentage (PCT).Several previous works in NER have been done on languages such as English (J.
Sun et al., 2002;C.W.
Shih et al., 2004), Japanese (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008), Chinese (J.
Sun et al., 2002;C.W.
Shih et al., 2004), and Vietnamese (N.C. Tu et al., 2005; T.X.
T. Pham et al., 2007; Q.T.
Tran etal., 2007); and NER systems have been developed using supervised learning methods such as DecisionTree, Maximum Entropy model (D. Nadeau and S. Sekine, 2007), and Support Vector Machine (Q.T.Tran et al., 2007), which achieved high performance.
Moreover, there are several studies for bilingualnamed entity recognition (C.J.
Lee et al., 2006; D. Feng et al., 2004; F. Huang and S. Vogel, 2002).However, for the English-Vietnamese pair, this task still presents a significant challenge in a number ofimportant respects (R. Sasano and S. Kurohashi, 2008).
Firstly, words in Vietnamese are not alwaysseparated by spaces, so word segmentation is necessary and segmentation errors will affect the levelof NER performance.
Secondly, some proper names of foreign persons and locations are loanwords orrepresented by phonetic symbols, so we can expect wide variations in some Vietnamese terms.
Thirdly,there are considerably fewer available existing resources such as lexicons, parsers, word nets, etc.
forVietnamese that have been used in previous studies.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

In fact, this process is applied to build an English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus by usingavailable English named entity recognition to tag entities in the English text, and then map them intoVietnamese text based on word alignments.
The mapping results are also corrected manually by using avisualization tool.The remainder of this paper describes the details of our work.
Firstly we address the data source forbuilding the corpus in Section 2.
Next, we present a procedure to build an English-Vietnamese NamedEntity Corpus by using a bilingual corpus and mapping English entities into Vietnamese entity tags inSection 3.
Experimental results and conclusion appear in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.2 Tagset and Data Source2.1 Tagset for Named EntitiesThere are many tagsets for the NER task, such as the hierarchical named entity tagset with 150 types (S.Sekine et al., 2002), the biological named entity tagset (Y. Tateisi et al., 2000; J-D Kim et al., 2003), orcommon named entity tagsets with 3 types and 7 tags (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998).
Accordingto the definition of the MUC-7 conference (N. Chinchor and P. Robinson, 1998), we will identify sixtypes of named entities:?
PERSON (PER): Person entities are limited to humans identified by name, nickname or alias.?
ORGANIZATION (ORG): Organization entities are limited to corporations, institutions, govern-ment agencies and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure.?
LOCATION (LOC): Location entities include names of politically or geographically definedplaces (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.).
Lo-cations also include man-made structures like airports, highways, streets, factories and monuments.?
TIME (TIM): Date/Time entities are complete or partial expressions of time of day, or date expres-sions.?
PERCENTAGE (PCT): Percentage entities are percentage expressions, including percentage rangeexpressions.?
MONEY (MON): Money entities include monetary expressions.We have developed a guide for bilingual named entity tagging and published it as EnVnNEguide athttp://code.google.com/p/evbcorpus/downloads/list.2.2 Data SourceThe data source for building the English-Vietnamese named entity corpus is a part of the EVBCorpus1,which consists of both original English text and its Vietnamese translations.
It contains 1,000 newsarticles defined as the EVBNews part of the EVBCorpus (as shown in Table 1) (Q.H.
Ngo et al., 2013).This corpus is also aligned semi-automatically at the word level.In particular, each article was translated one to one at the whole article level, so we align sentence tosentence.
Then, sentences are aligned semi-automatically at the word level, including automatic align-ment by class-based method (D. Dien et al., 2002) and use of the BiCAT tool (Q.H.
Ngo and W. Wini-warter, 2012) to correct the alignments manually.
The details of the corpus are listed in Table 1.Parallel documents are also chosen and classified into categories, such as economy, entertainment(art and music), health, science, social, politics, and technology (percentage of each category is shownin Table 2 and Figure 1).
The wide range of categories ensures that named entities in the corpus arediversified enough for other following tasks.86Figure 1: The distribution of articles and sentences in each topic in EVBNewsTable 1: Characteristics of EVBNews partEnglish VietnameseFiles 1,000 1,000Paragraphs 25,015 25,015Sentences 45,531 45,531Words 740,534 832,441Words in Alignments 654,060 768,0313 Building Named Entity Corpus3.1 Model of Building EVNECorpus from EVBCorpusFigure 2 shows the main modules of bilingual named entity corpus building, including three main mod-ules: pre-processing, named entity recognition, bilingual entity mapping, and bilingual entity correction.According to this workflow, the bilingual corpus will be tagged with named entities on the English text,then, named entities are mapped from English to Vietnamese text.
Finally, annotators will correct bothEnglish and Vietnamese named entities by using the BiCAT tool (Q.H.
Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012).At the first stage, a Named Entity Recognition system is used to tag English entities in the Englishsentence.
Several Named Entity Recognition systems for English text are available online.
For traditionalNER, the most popular publicly available systems are: OpenNLP NameFinder2, Illinois NER3systemby Lev Ratinov (L. Ratinov and D. Roth, 2009), Stanford NER4system by Jenny Rose Finkel (J.R.Finkel et al., 3005), and Lingpipe NER5system by Baldwin, B. and B. Carpenter (B. Carpenter, 2006).The Stanford NER reports 86.86 F1 on the CoNLL03 NER shared task data.
We chose the Stanford NERto provide for the ability of our corpus for tagging with multi-type, such as 3 classes, 4 classes, and 7classes.The following example is the result of the Stanford NER for the English sentence ?Prime MinisterGordon Brown resigned as Britain ?s top politician on Tuesday evening, making way for Conservative1http://code.google.com/p/evbcorpus/2http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/opennlp/3http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software view/44http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/index.shtml5http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/index.html87Table 2: Number of files and sentences for each topicTopic File SentenceEconomy 125 4,326Entertainment 11 365Health 336 21,107Politics 141 4,253Science 34 1,692Social 110 3,699Sport 22 838Technology 104 2,609Misc 117 117Total 1,000 45,531Figure 2: Architecture of building EVNECorpus from EVBCorpusleader David Cameron.?

]ORG.3.2 Mapping English to Vietnamese Named EntitiesAt the next stage, every alignment will be mapped from English into Vietnamese tokens.
Every namedentity tag on linked English words is mapped to Vietnamese tokens on the target sentence.
Left and rightboundaries are also detected to re-build named entity chunks on the Vietnamese sentence (as shown inFigure 3):?
Remove all alignments which are not related to English named entity tokens?
Map English named entity tokens to Vietnamese text by using alignments88?
Identify the boundaries of named entities and rebuild named entity script text.Figure 3: Mapping named entitiesHowever, there is a difference between the number of tagged English named entities and mappedVietnamese named entities (as shown in Table 3).
Several English entities in the English sentences arenot translated into the Vietnamese text, therefore, these entities are not mapped.Table 3: Number of entities at the first stageTag Name Tagged English Entity Mapped Vietnamese Entity Unmapped EntityLOC Location 10,418 10,354 64ORG Organization 8,197 8,120 77PER Person 7,217 7,153 64TIM Time 4,474 4,437 37MON Money 1,003 992 11PCT Percent 1,201 1,193 8Total 32,510 32,249 261There are several common errors of the mapping stage.
The most frequent error is caused by theseparation of entities from English text in Vietnamese.
It means that there are several cases of one taggedEnglish named entity being separated into two distinct Vietnamese named entities in the Vietnamesetext.
On the other hand, for example, the phrase ?President [Bill Clinton]PERbetween [1994]TIMand[1997]TIM?
has one PER entity and two TIM entities whereas the Vietnamese translated text ?T?ngth?ng [Bill Clinton]PERtrong giai ?o?n [1994-1997]TIM?
has one PER entity and only one TIM entity.Three common reasons which lead to mapping errors (these cases are discussed in the next section byanalysing unmatched cases) are:?
The differences between English and Vietnamese characteristics.?
The splitting of an English named entity to two Vietnamese entities.?
The entities are replaced by pronouns and possessive pronouns in the target sentences or the otherway around.893.3 Correcting Named EntitiesAs shown in Figure 4, we use the BiCAT tool (Q.H.
Ngo and W. Winiwarter, 2012) for correcting namedentities in both English and Vietnamese sentences.
The BiCAT tool is a visualization tool based on drag,drop, and edit label operations (actions) to correct the sentence pairs.
It is designed for annotators toreview whole phrase structures of English and Vietnamese sentences.
They can compare the Englishnamed entity result with the Vietnamese named entity result and correct them in both sentences.
Thecomparison is also used to detect incorrect named entities in both English and Vietnamese text.Figure 4: Screenshot of BiCAT with the named entity mapMoreover, several additional information, such as POS tagger, chunker, is also shown for buildingfurther linguistic tags.
Several features are implemented on the entity matrix at the right panel of theBiCAT tool:?
Show the sentence where named entities occur.?
Highlight the pairs which have imbalance in number of entities between source sentence and targetsentence.?
Quick jump to the sentence pair on which the user clicks.4 Experiment and ResultsNamed entities include six tags: Location (LOC), Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Time includingdate tags (TIM), Money (MON), and Percentage (PCT).
English text is tagged with English NER tags byStanford NER and then mapped to Vietnamese text.
Next, Vietnamese entity tags are corrected manually.In total, the English-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus (EVNECorpus) has 32,454 English namedentities and 33,338 Vietnamese named entities in the EVBNews corpus (see Table 4 for details and itscomparison in Figure 5).90Table 4: Number of entities in the EVNECorpusTag Name English Entity Vietnamese Entity Unmatched EntityLOC Location 10,406 11,343 998ORG Organization 8,177 8,218 189PER Person 7,201 7,205 199TIM Time 4,408 4,417 136MON Money 1,003 993 32PCT Percent 1,194 1,170 27Total 32,454 33,338 1,581There are several common unmatched named entities in English-Vietnamese named entity corpus: theEnglish-Vietnamese Named Entity Corpus (EVNECorpus) has 32,454 English named entities and 33,338Vietnamese named entities in the EVBNews corpus (see Table 5).
Moreover, to classify the unmatchednamed entities, we also tag part-of-speech for English sentences by the POS Tagger6of the StanfordNatural Language Processing Group (K. Toutanova and C. D. Manning, 2000).As shown in Table 5, a large number of English adjectives (tagged JJ tag) are not tagged as named en-tities while their translations are tagged as locations.
Most of them are coming from country names, suchas French, English, and Vietnamese, and they refer to people or languages.
In the English text ?Cubanmissile crisis?, the word Cuban is not tagged as a location because Cuban is an adjective (?Cuban/JJmissile/NN crisis/NN?
), while, in its Vietnamese translation, ?Kh?ng kho?ng t?n l?a [Cu Ba]LOC?, ?CuBa?
is tagged as a location.
Moreover, there are several English named entities that are split into twoentities in the Vietnamese sentences.
For example, ?
[Thailand]LOC?s [Ministry of Public Health]ORG?has two entities while its translation is [B?
Y t?
Th?i Lan]ORG.
Finally, there are several named entitiesthat are replaced by pronouns and possessive pronouns (30 cases for PRP and 11 cases for PRP$) in thetranslated sentences and the inverse direction (38 cases).Figure 5: English entities and Vietnamese entities in the EVNECorpus6http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml91Table 5: Common Unmatched Named EntitiesDescription/Examples POS Count1 English named entities without alignments to Vietnamese words 1902 Vietnamese named entities without alignments to English source words 1063English named entities with alignments to Vietnamese words rather thanNNP 38Vietnamese entities4Vietnamese named entities with alignments to English words rather thanEnglish entities- Eurobond, NN 10- Democrats, Eurobonds, Socialists NNS 45- Kenyan, French, NNP 229- Russians, Danish, Philippines NNPS 107- They, he, she, it PRP 36- Him, His, her, them PRP$ 11- French, English, and Fuji-based JJ 797- other cases Others 12Total 1,5815 ConclusionIn this paper, we have shown a workflow of building an English-Vietnamese named entity corpus.
Thisworkflow is based on an aligned bilingual corpus.
In addition, we built a Vietnamese word segmen-tation corpus for training and evaluating the system.
As result, the corpus is built semi-automaticallywith over 45,000 sentences, and totally 32,454 English named entities and 33,338 Vietnamese namedentities.
Moreover, we also pointed out several differences in named entity tagging between English andVietnamese text.
These differences can be used to map named entity tags, linguistic information, and inmachine translation systems.However, adding to the six common named entity types additional names (such as product, disease,and event names) is also necessary, and we need further research for identifying them in bilingual corporabecause they affect the named entity recognition process as well as the corpus.ReferencesBob Carpenter 2006.
