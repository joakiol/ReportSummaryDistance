Wc start out from the assumption thatcausative and perceptual verbs, like auxiliaries, canlexically 'raise' the arguments of the non-finite verbsthey govern to their own list of arguments through"argument composition" (\[H&N(1989)\]).1 In t roduct ionDutch cross serial dependencies (DCSDs), well-knownfrom (1) and (2), still challenge computational linguis-tics for an efficient treatment.

The con-struction is only licensed by members of two closedclasses of verbs, the class of perceptual verbs likezicn( "see" ), hoven( "hear" ) and voelen( "feel" ), and theclass of causative verbs like laten('qet/make") andhelpen("help").
In the analysis put forward here wcemphasize this lexical aspect of the phenomenon; inour analysis DCSDs are strictly tied to the subcate-gorization and semantics of perceptual and causativeverbs.
We analyze them as verbs which select, apartfrom their subject, a nonfinite V-projection which de-notes an event.

Er-rors are, of course, completely my own.rize for the arguments of the verb they govern, a mech-anism frequently referred to as argument compositionor argument inheritance.Recently DCSDs have been analyzed in a non-standard version of tIPSG 1 in \[P~eape(fc.)\].
In his so-called sequence union approach, the standard conceptof phrase structure grammar (i.e.
that a string is de-fined as the terminal yield of a phrase structure tree)is abandoned.
Our analysis is more standard, in thesense that we only need to refer to the lexicon andthe HPSG-mechanism of structure sharing3 Our pre-ferred explanatory mechanism, argument composition,is not so much an additional mechanism as an effectwhich derives from careful specification of structuresharing, and structure sharing is already at the theo-retical core of HPSG.Furthermore, argument composition is indepen-dently motivated, because Dutch is like German withrcspect to the phrase-structural behaviour of auxil-iaries, and argument composition in German construc-tions with auxiliaries is well-motivated (\[H&N(1989)\]).So we have good reason to assume argument composi-tion present in the theory, regardless of DCSDs.2 Event  Semant ics  in  HPSGThe choice of semantics in terms of a theory of events,known from \[Davidson(1967)\], offers interesting ad-vantages and explanations of logical and linguistic phe-uomena, motivating tt, e development of a constraint-based version of it.
3 So, in the spirit of event seman-tics we propose that main verbs like voeren("feed')in (3) should denote a discourse referent, which is infact a very natural assumption.
In (3) and throughoutthe paper, recurring \[-~'s indicate structure sharing,that is token-identity of information, as is common us-agc in HPSG.
Note also that we follow \[Borsley(1987)\]in representing subjects as values of SlJB3 and follow\[P&S(1994)\] (chapter 9) in representing non-subject1 Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar,  which the readeris p .

less familiar with (see \[P&S(1994)\]).2In fact our analysis differs from many previous analyses ofDCSDs in that we do not refer to any 'additional' (often pow-erful) mechanisms ( equence union, head wrapping, repeatedrightward head movement).3The combination of" I IPSG with (shallow) event seman-tics and translation to an event-based logical fomn originateswith work on the EC-sponsored PLUS project, EsPaiT P52fi4,a "Pragmatics-based Language Understanding System".818arguments as wducs of C()MI'~.

We assume that causative andperceptuM verbs syntactically behave just like auxil-iaries in this respect.Tile difference between auxiliaries on the one handand perceptual and causative verbs on the other weview as basically semantic.
We take it that auxiliariessemantically more or less operate on events, affectingfeatures for tense and aspect or modality.
Causativeand perceptual verbs on the other hand will be ana-lyzed as events themselves, events which take otherevents as their argument~ in general as a theme (viz,a valne of AIt(~, cf.
the entry in (7) below).ht chapter 9 of \[P&S(1994)\] the approach to local se--lection from \[Borsley(1987)\] is developed fltrther andleads to the Valence t)rinciple, which refers to the va-lence features SiJI-~d and C()MPS through 'F':(4) Va lence  Pr ine iph ,  Chapter 9, \[P&S(1994)\]In a headed phrase, h)r each valence featnre F,the t,' wdue of the head-daughter is the con-.catenation of the phrase's F value with the listof SYNSI,;M values of tt, e F-daughters' value.The general effect of the principle on a phrase whichis headed by some sign is that this headed sign canonly become 'complete' (or "saturated' )  if it is com-bined with the appropriate arguments.
For example,in the case of a transitive verb, such a verb must finda subject NP (selected through Sl;B./) and some oh.ject (selected through (:()Ml'S).
If we assume a lintclause structure analysis of Dutch and we furthenm)reassume lcxical signs like (3) and (7), then the imme~diate dominance statements (5) and (6) will suffice todescribe tilt: constructim, of Dutch we are concernedwith here.
r Here the H,S and C indicate that thedaughters of the phrase include a head, a subject andcomplements, not necessarily in that order (eft chap-ter 9 of \[P&S(1994)\] for details).

We arrange the lexicon so that any value of coywill always be an unsaturated base form verb which isdefined as LEX+ as well.
By the Valency Principle,this selection requirement of the governing verb willbe appropriately 'cancelled' after string concatenationduring parsing.Central to our analysis of the case-markings ofNPs in the Dutch Mittelfeld is the assumption from\[Pollard(fc.
)\] that base forms of verbs do not assignany case to their subject.
The value for the subject-NP's CASE-feature in (3), "c^s~", is the supertype inthe type hierarchy for those atomic types that are ap-propriate values of the feature CASE.
So, the valuecast."
is the supertype of NOM and Ace in Dutch and En-glish, and in German also of DA'r and G~N.
The resultof assigning the subject-NP this supertype for case inpractice bolls down to giving this NP some kind of"any"-value for case; the case-value CASE of such anNP will unify with any other possible case value.In our analysis, the discontinuous relation betweenarguments and verbs in DCSDs is brought about firstlyby lexically defining finite pereeptuals like zag (andfinite causatives) as argument composition verbs, alongthe following lines: 9(7) PHON(~o~)\[MAJOR ~ \]HEAD VFORM bUNI SUBJ ( NP\[NOM\]I~ )COMPS ~NP\[~ocl ) ~ \ [ \ ]~OV ( "V\[I\]ASE\] \ ] )SUBJ ( ~\]NP )COMPS \ [ \ ]CONT \ [ \ ]LEX +CONTENT 'bET ~VnNTPARA \ [ \ ]N / / \[\] /\[\] JLEX +The finite argument composition verb zag selects asingular nominative NP through its suB J-feature.
Asnon-subject arguments it selects through its COMPS-feature first the NP tagged as \ [ \ ]  which is unified withthe SUB J-value of the governed verb(s), and secondlythe list \[~\] of zero or more non-subject argumentsof the governed verb(s).
And crucially, being a gov-erning verb, zag selects through cov  a governed baseform verb, 1?
with as SUB J-value " \ [~' ,  as COMPS-value9In this entry and throughout the paper, @ stands for con-catenation of arbitrary-length lists of arguments.1?One base form verb, or a base form verb-headed verbal clus-"\[~2' and as semantics " \ [ \ ] ' .
Note that, since the gov-erned v\[nsi.
:\] is selected as missing a subject and a listof complements, it must not 'find' this subject or thesecomplements, which it indeed doesn't (cf.
the tree inFigure 1).As it were in passing, the governing perceptual verb(or causative verb alike) imposes accusative case onthe NP which denotes the suloject-argument of thegoverned verb.
The unification of \[CASE CASK\] and\[CASE Acc\] will be forced through the structure-sharingindicated in (7) as " \ [ \ ] ' ,  and will result in the morespecific restriction \[CASE ,cc\].
This accounts for theaccusative case-marking on hasp ("her") in examples(1) and (2), and in general on all non-subject argu-ments in such constructions.The second and crucial step in our account of thediscontinuity is accounting for the linear order in theverb cluster with DCSDs.
The linear order of the verbcluster in Dutch we account for through (8):(8) Linear Precedence l=tule Dutch Verb Clusters\[c~ov ( x )\] < x(9) Linear Precedence Rule German Verb ClustersX < \[(~ov ( x )\]By these LP-rnles, in each part of the binary branch-ing verb cluster the governing verb will appear head-initial in Dutch, and head-final in German.
n It isstraightforward to show that the above approach hasthe desired effect also for the sentence (2) mentionedin the introduction if we define a lexical entry for thecausative helpen with a syntax and semantics along thesame lines as the perceptual zag.
The only differencemust be that such nonfinite entries do not assign NOMto their subject, but "CASl.:".
Other than that, therewill just be additional embeddings in the semantics aswell as in the verb cluster.
Thus, by the ID-rule in (6)and the lexical entries for causatives and perceptuals,we account for the recursiveness of the phenomenon,cf.
the tree in Figure 2.4 Conc lus ionWe extended the \[H&N(1989)\]-analysis of Germanto Dutch, accounting for the difference, resp.
nestedvs.
cross serial dependencies, through one single LP-parameter.
Also, we argued that such an argumentcomposition approach is to be preferred over severalalternative approaches, ince argument composition is-n't an 'additional' mechanism.
Further linguistic ad-vantages of this approach, i.e.
accounts of irregularcase assignments and constraints on double infinitives,are discussed in \[Rentier(1994)\].
We are able to deriveverb second constructions by standard application ofter; due to the ID-schema in (6) either will be LEX-\[-, so thatwe are able to recltrsively build up bigger and bigger LEX+-complexes.u LP-rules like these are common in HPSG,  cf.
