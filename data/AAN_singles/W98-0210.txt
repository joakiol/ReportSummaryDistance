A Media-Independent Content Language for Integrated Text andGraphics GenerationNancy Green*, Giuseppe Carenini**, Stephan Kerpedjiev*, Steven Roth*,Johanna Moore***Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA**University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USAAbstractThis paper describes a media-independent k owl-edge representation scheme, or content language, fordescribing the content of communicative goals andactions.
The language is used within an intelligentsystem for automatically generating integrated textand information graphics presentations about com-plex, quantitative information.
The language is de-signed to satisfy four requirements: to represent in-formation about complex quantitative r lations andaggregate properties; compositionality; o representcertain pragmatic distinctions needed for satisfyingcommunicative goals; and to be usable as input bythe media-specific generators in our system.1 Int roduct ionThis paper describes a media-independentknowledge representation scheme, or contentlanguage, for describing the content of commu-nicative goals and actions.
The language isused within an intelligent system for automati-cally generating integrated text and informationgraphics 1 presentations about complex, quanti-tative information.
The goal of the current im-plementation of the system is to produce analy-ses and summarizations of the quantitative dataoutput by a transportation scheduling program.In our approach \[Kerpedjiev etal.1997a,Kerpedjiev et al1997b, Green et a1.1998,This work was supported by DARPA contract num-ber DAA-1593K0005.le.g., charts, tables, maps, rather than pictorial formsof representation.69Kerpedjiev et ai.1998\], the content and orga-nization of a presentation is first planned ata media-independent level using a hierarchicalplanner \[Young1994\].
In this way, a high-levelpresentation goal, such as to assist the user toevaluate a transportation schedule created bythe scheduling program, is ultimately decom-posed into media-independent subgoals, whosecontent is represented in the content language.The content language also is used to representthe content of the media-independent commu-nicative acts, e.g., Assert and Recommend, se-lected by the planner to satisfy these subgoals.
2Content language expressions are constructedby the plan constraint functions of the presen-tation plan operators during planning.The content language in the presentationplan is used by the system's two media-specificgenerators, one for text and one for informationgraphics.
A media allocation component de-cides which parts of the plan shall be realized byeach generator.
The text generator transformsits assigned parts to sentence specifications,for realization by a general-purpose ntencegenerator (SURGE) \[Elhadad and Robin1996\].The graphics generator transforms its assignedparts of the plan to a sequence of user taskswhich a graphic must support in order to sat-isfy the presentation goals.
The tasks arethen input to a graphic design system (SAGE)2In other words, the content language describes thatwhich is to be asserted, recommended, believed, etc.,rather than the types of communicative acts to be per-formed or propositional ttitudes which the acts are in-tended to achieve.\[Roth and Mattis1990, Roth et a1.1994\] whichautomatically designs and realizes a graphicsupporting the tasks.One of the requirements for our content lan-guage is the ability to represent complex de-scriptions of quantitative database attributes,such as total port capacity of all ports and90~ of the total weight of the cargo arrivingby clay 25.
In addition to application-specificconcepts such as port capacity, such descrip-tions involve the specification of application-independent quantitative relations (e.g., 90~ of...), aggregate properties of sets (e.g., total ...of all ... ), and time-dependent relations (e.g.,increase from ... to ... during the interval ...).Thus, we would like for the language to be ableto express a wide range of quantitative and tem-poral relations and aggregate properties, ratherthan just those required for the current domainof transportation scheduling.Another requirement is for the content lan-guage to represent these descriptions composi-tionally.
A compositional representation shouldfacilitate the work of the text and graphics gen-erators, as well as media coordination.A third requirement for the content lan-guage is the ability to represent subtle differ-ences in communicative intention with respectto the same data.
To give an example in thedomain which will be used for illustration inthe rest of the paper, the same data 3 could un-derly either the assertion that Three newspapersthat are circulated in Pittsburgh carry only na-tional news or the assertion that Three news-papers that carry only national news are circu-lated in Pittsburgh.
However, while conveyingthe same facts about the three newspapers, thetwo assertions are not interchangeable.
The firstassertion would be more effective than the sec-ond in an argument such asBe careful which newspaper you read tofind out what is going on locally.
The3All data used in the paper is fictitious.
However,many of the examples were inspired by a naturally oc-curing example about he numbers of readers of newspa-pers read in Pittsburgh.
We have selected this domainfor illustration because it requires minimal backgroundknowledge.70Post-Gazette covers both national andlocal news, but three newspapers thatare circulated in Pittsburgh carry onlynational news.while the second would be more effective thanthe first inPittsburghers are interested in nationalaffairs.
In fact, three newspapers thatcarry only national news are circulatedin Pittsburgh.As will be shown later in the paper, the con-tent language nables related assertions such asthese to be differentiated.A final requirement is for the representa-tion scheme to be media-independent i  orderto provide a common input language for themedia-specific generators.
We assume that sucha common language will facilitate the difficultproblem of media coordination.
On the otherhand, the language must satisfy the needs ofboth the text and information graphics genera-tors.In the rest of the paper, first we describethe content language, focusing on aspects of thecontent language which are applicable to otherdomains.
Next, we illustrate how subtle varia-tions in communicative intention can be repre-sented in the content language, and give exam-ples of how they can be expressed in text andinformation graphics.
Finally, we describe somerelated work.2 Content LanguageIn order to ensure that the language would beapplicable to a variety of quantitative domains,we first performed a corpus analysis, the resultsof which are summarized in the next section.Then we describe the syntax we adopted to sat-isfy the requirements given in the introduction.2.1 Corpus  Ana lys i sWe have collected samples of presentations withintegrated natural anguage and graphics in or-der to describe and analyze the vocabulary andstructure of such presentations.
To ensure gen-erality, the corpus includes presentations fromdifferent disciplines (Economics and Medicine)and intended for different audiences.
4 It alsoincludes samples from collections of presenta-tions compiled by others, such as \[Tufte1983,Tufte1990, Tufte1997, Kosslyn1994\], and pre-scriptive examples found in books on howto design effective presentations \[Zelazny1996,Kosslyn1994\].The analysis of this corpus contributed i-rectly to the development of a vocabulary forthe content language.
To describe the content ofthe presentations in the corpus, we distinguishthree different sets of predicates with associatedmodifiers, as follows: 5?
Comparison Predicates: \[much\] Greater,Lower I Highest, Lowest I \[very\] Far-from,Close-to I \[almost I exactly \] Equal, n-Times.Comparison Predicates apply to anyquantitative attribute of individuals or sets,e.g., On this measure Central Europe's stock-markets are still puny compared with those offast-growing Asian countries.?
Global Predicates: \[widelylslightly\] Vary\[:from :to\], Constant.Global Predicates apply to quantitative at-tributes of sets, e.g., Sales representative p r-formance is uneven.?
Trend Predicates: Remain-constant I \[con-siderably I slightly\] Increase, Decrease \[:from:to\] I Drop, Fall, Rise \[:from :to\] I Reach-a-Plateau I Fluctuate,Trend Predicates apply only to time series (aset of data ordered chronologically), e.g., Pro-duction of television sets in Russia fell from4.5m units in 1991 to fewer than lm in 1995.2.2 SyntaxThe first three requirements described in the In-troduction (representing quantitative and tem-poral relations and aggregate properties, com-4Economics: The Economist (March-August 1996).Medicine: UC Berkeley Wellness Letter (June 1993 andSeptember 1996), Scientific American (September 1996),New England Journal o\] Medicine (April-August 1996).5Square brackets indicate optionality, the barexclusive-or, and commas separate variants with differ-ing orientations.71positionality, and representing certain prag-matic distinctions) led us to make use of a first-order logic with restricted quantification (RQ-FOL), which has been used for representingthe meaning of natural anguage queries involv-ing complex referring expressions \[Woods1983,Webber1983\].
The features of RQFOL mostuseful for our purposes are (i) that it permitspragmatic distinctions to be made among ex-pressions which are semantically equivalent, and(ii) that it supports the compositional specifica-tion of complex descriptions of discourse ntities\[Webber1983\].A pragmatic distinction supported in RQ-FOL and our content language is the distinc-tion between the main predication of an expres-sion and information to be conveyed about theobjects of the main predication.
For example,although (la) and (lb) are semantically equiv-alent with (lc), they are not interchangeable intheir effectiveness for achieving different com-municative intentions (as was demonstrated inthe Introduction.)
In (la) the main predicationis about news coverage, whereas in (lb) it isabout newspaper circulation.
(la) Three newspapers that are circulated inPittsburgh carry only national news.
(lb) Three newspapers that carry only nationalnews are circulated in Pittsburgh.
(lc) There is a set of three newspapers such thatfor every newspaper in the set, it iscirculated in Pittsburgh and carries onlynational news.To represent this distinction in the contentlanguage, a communicative act has the form,(Act Proposition Referents), where Act specifiesthe type of action (such as Assert), Propositionis a quantifier-free FOL formula describing themain predication, and Referents is a list describ-ing the arguments of the main predication.
(Itis assumed that the agent performing a com-municative action is the system, and that theaudience is the user.)
For example, (la) and(Ib) can be analyzed ass realizing the assertions(2a) and (2b), respectively.
In (2a), the mainpredication is (has-coverage ?dl National-only);the variable ?dl is further described as threenewspapers that are circulated in Pittsburgh.
6In (2b), the main predication is (has-circulation?dI Pittsburgh); the variable ?dl is further de-scribed as three newspapers whose coverage isnational news only.
(2a) (Assert (has-coverage ?dl National-only)((?dl (for (cardinal 3) ?x newspaper(has-circulation ?x Pittsburgh)))))(2b) (Assert (has-circulation ?dl Pittsburgh)((?dl (for (cardinal 3) ?x newspaper(has-coverage ?x National-only)))))In general, each element of the Referents listhas the form (term description), where term isa variable or a database object identifier; andterm denotes a discourse ntity.
If provided, de-scription specifies information about term thatis required to achieve the goal(s) of the commu-nicative act, as opposed to information whoseonly function is to enable the audience to iden-tify the entity.
Only descriptions with an at-tributive function are specified in the presenta-tion plan.
Referential descriptions, whose func-tion is only to enable the audience to identifyan entity, are constructed by the media-specificgenerators.
(For information about the differentroles of attributive and referential descriptionsin our system, see \[Green et a1.1998\].)
In gen-eral, description is of the form (for quantifiervariable class restriction).
(In (2a) and (2b),quantifier is the cardinal 3, the class is news-paper, and the restriction is (has-circulation?z Pittsburgh) and (has-coverage ?x National-only), respectively.
)Complex descriptions can easily be ex-pressed in a compositional manner in the con-tent language.
For example, (3a) is a possiblerealization in text of the assertion given in (3b).
(A graphic realizing (3b) is shown in (3c) of Fig-ure 1.)
In (3b), the main predication, (gt ?dl?d2), is that ?dl is greater than ?d2.
?dl is tobe described as the unique integer ?x such that?x is the number of readers of SPPG.
($PPGis a database object denoting the Post-Gazette.
)?d2 is described as the unique integer ?x such6By convention, symbols prefixed with ?
are variables,and symbols prefixed with $ are database identifiers.72that ?x is the total of ?d3; ?d3 is described asthe unique set of integers ?y such that ?y is thenumber of readers of ?d4; and ?d4 is describedas the elements of the set ($WSJ ,  $NYT ,  and$USA), (whose elements are database objectsdenoting the Wall Street Journal, the New YorkTimes, and USA Today, respectively).
(3a)(3b)The number of readers of the Post-Gazette isgreater than the number of Pittsburghreaders of the New York Times, the WallStreet Journal, and USA Today combined.
(Assert (gt ?dl ?d2)((?dl (for the ?x integer(has-number-of-readers SPPG ?x)))($PPG 0)(?d2 (for the ?x integer (total ?x ?d3)))(?d3 (for the ?w set (lambda ?y integer(has-number-of-Pitts-readers ?d4 ?y)))(?d4 (for all ?z newspaper(in-set ?z ($WSJ $NYT SUSA))))($WSJ 0) ($NYT 0) ($USA 0))3 ExamplesIn this section we illustrate how different com-municative intentions about the same data canbe represented in the content language, and howthese intentions can be expressed in text and in-formation graphics.
One goal of this exercise isto illustrate what distinctions can be expressedgraphically, but not what information should beexpressed in graphics.
(The problem of decidingwhich media to use, media allocation, is beyondthe scope of this paper.)
Thus, the examplesof graphics are minimal in the sense that theyhave been designed to convey the informationto be asserted and as little as possible other in-formation.
However, in some cases it is not pos-sible not to convey more in graphics than wasintended.For example in (3c) in Figure 1, which re-alizes (3b), the graphic also conveys informa-tion about relative numbers of readers of eachof the newspapers, e.g., that the Post-Gazettehas about one-third more than the sum of theothers, and that the others have about the samenumber of readers each.
Note that althoughit is not the communicative intention in (3b)(3c) (4c)(5c)?

.Figure 1: Assertions expressed in graphicsto convey the particular numbers of readers ofeach newspaper (hence the x-axis does not showactual numbers), information about the actualnumbers of readers of each newspaper is neededduring graphics generation to design (3c).
(Ifthe presentation's intention was to convey theparticular numbers of readers of the newspa-pers, then different assertions specifying the ac-tual numbers would be planned.
)Whereas in (3b), four newspapers are indi-viduated, it is possible to make an assertionsuch as (4b) in which the members of the set($NAT) of newspapers with only national cov-erage are not individuated.
The assertion in(4b) could be expressed in text as (4a), or ingraphics in (4c) in Figure 1.
However, thisgraphic still expresses more than (4b), e.g., thatthe number of PPG readers is about one-thirdmore than the number of NAT readers (eventhough the x-axis does not show the actual num-bers of readers).
(4a) The number of readers of the Post-Gazette isgreater than the total number of readers ofthe newspapers ead in Pittsburgh withnational coverage only.73(4b) (Assert (gt ?dl ?d2)((?dl (for the ?x integer(has-number-of-readers SPPG ?x)))($PPG 0)(?d2 (for the ?y integer(has-total-number-of-Pitts-readersSNAT ?y)))($NAT (for the ?w set (lambda ?z newspaper(and (has-coverage ?zNational-only)(has-circulation ?z Pittsburgh))))))In contrast o (3b), (hb) differentiates themembers of NAT, but does not identify or oth-erwise describe them.
(hb) could be expressedin text as (ha), and in graphics as in (5 c) in Fig-ure 1.
Once again, the graphic has side-effects.In this case, it conveys additional informationabout the relative numbers of readers amongthe newspapers with national coverage only, andthe fact that there are three of those newspa-pers.
Comparing (5c) to (3c), in (3c) the totalnumber of readers of the three other newspapersis expressed by concatenating segments of barsrepresenting the three newspapers into a singlebar whose length represents he total number ofreaders of the three newspapers.
Although thisinformation can be computed from (5c), it is notdirectly realized in the graphic.
(Sa) The number of readers of the Post-Gazette isgreater than the number of readers inPittsburgh of any newspaper with nationalcoverage only.
(55) (Assert (gt ?all ?d2)((?dl (for the ?x integer(has-number-of-readers $PPG ?x)))($PPG O)(?d2 (for the ?y integer(has-number-of-Pitts-readers ?d3 ?y)))(?d3 (for each ?z newspaper(has-coverage ?z National))))In contrast o the preceding examples, (6b)illustrates a communicative intention (aboutthe same data as in the other examples) with adifferent main predication.
In text, (6b) couldbe expressed as in (6a); the main predication isabout the coverage of the Post-Gazette ratherthan about the number of readers.
This dif-ference in main predication results in a graphicsuch as (6c) in Figure i with a different struc-ture than those of the preceding examples.
(6a) Only 1 of the newspapers ead in Pittsburgh,the Post-Gazette, has both national andlocal coverage.
(6b) (Assert (has-coverage $PPG Local-National)(($PPG (for (only 1) ?x newspaper(in-set ?x ?dl)))(?dl (for the ?w set (lambda ?x newspaper(has-circulation ?x Pittsburgh)))))4 Re la ted  WorkSeveral projectshave studied the problem of media-independentknowledge representation schemes for auto-matic generation of multimedia presentations.The COMET \[Feiner and McKeown1991\] andWIP \[Wahlster et ah1993\] systems generate in-structions for operating physical devices, and\[Maybury1991\] describes a system that designsnarrated or animated route directions in a car-tographic information system.
These systemsrepresent content about complex sequences ofactions the user can perform on the physicaldevice and their effects, as well as spatial con-74cepts.
However, this work is not relevant oinformation graphics generation.The multimedia system whose focus is clos-est to ours,PostGraphe \[Fasciano and Lapalme1996\], is asystem that generates multimedia statistical re-ports consisting of graphics and text.
However,there are some fundamental differences with ourapproach.
First, in Postgraphe it is assumedthat a presentation is about the entire dataset,whereas our content language can be used todescribe subsets and individuals in the dataset.Second, in Postgraphe graphics are generateddirectly from its knowledge representation lan-guage; then text is generated based upon thegraphics.
Thus, it is not clear whether the lan-guage is truly media-independent, i.e., whetherit could be used to generate text directly.
Also,Postgraphe's language of intentions is less gen-eral than our approach of generating presenta-tion plans for achieving communicative goals.For example, in Postgraphe the language canbe used to specify the intention to compare twovariables of a dataset in a way that emphasizesan increase.
In our approach, complex argu-ments can be planned.5 Conc lus ionsThis paper describes a media-independentknowledge representation scheme, or contentlanguage, for describing the content of commu-nicative goals and actions.
The language isused within an intelligent system for automati-cally generating integrated text and informationgraphics presentations about complex, quanti-tative information.
To ensure that the languagewill be applicable to a variety of quantitativedomains, it is based upon a corpus analysis ofintegrated natural language and graphics pre-sentations.
The language is designed to sat-isfy four requirements: to represent informationabout complex quantitative r lations and aggre-gate propertiess; compositionality; to representcertain pragmatic distinctions needed for satis-fying communicative goals; and to be usable aspart of the input to the media-specific (text andgraphics) generators.References\[Elhadad and Robin1996\] M.
