Statistical Method of Recognizing Local Cohesionin Spoken DialoguesNaoto Katoh and Tsuyoshi MorimotoATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research LaboratoriesSeika-cho Soraku-gun Kyoto 619-02 Japan{katonao, morimoto }@ itl.atr.co.jpAbstractThis paper presents a method for auto-matically recognizing local cohesion be-tween utterances, which is one of the dis-course structures in task-oriented spokendialogues.
More specifically we can auto-matically acquire discourse knowledgefrom an annotated corpus with local co-hesion.
In this paper we focus on speechact type-based local cohesion.
The pre-sented method consists of two steps 1)identifying the speech act expressions inan utterance and 2) calculating the plausi-bility of local cohesion between thespeech act expressions by using the dia-logue corpus annotated with local cohe-sion.
We present two methods of interpo-lating the plausibility of local cohesionbased on surface information on utter-ances.
The presented method has ob-tained a 93% accuracy for closed data anda 78% accuracy for open data in recogniz-ing a pair of utterances with local cohe-sion.1 IntroductionFor ambiguity resolution, processing of a dis-course structure is one of the important processesin Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Indeed,discourse structures play a useful role in speechrecognition, which is an application of NLP.
In thecase of Japanese, it is very difficult to recognizethe end in utterances by using current speech rec-ognition techniques because the sound power ofan ending tends to be small.
For example, "desu",which represents he speech act type "response",is often misrecognized as"desu-ka (question)" or"desu-ne (confirmation)".
On the other hand,Japanese can easily select he adequate expression"desu", when the intention of the previous utter-ance is concerned with a question.
This is becausethey use the coherence relation (local cohesion)between the two utterances, question-response.In the conventional approach (i.e., rule-based approach) to processing the discourse struc-ture \[Hauptmann 88\]\[Kudo 90\]\[Yamaoka91\]\[Young 91\], NLP engineers built discourseknowledge by hand-coding.
However, the rule-based approach as a bottleneck in that it is a hardjob to add discourse knowledge when the em-ployed NLP system deals with a larger domainand more vocabulary.Recently, statistical approaches have beenattracting attention for their ability to acquire lin-guistic knowledge from a corpus.
Compared withthe above rule-based approach, a statistical ap-proach is easy to apply to larger domains ince thelinguistic knowledge can be automatically ex-tracted from the corpora concerned with the do-main.
However, little research as been reportedin discourse processing \[Nagata 94\]\[Reithinger95\], while in the areas of morphological nalysisand syntactic analysis, many research studies havebeen proposed in recent years.This paper presents a method for automati-cally recognizing local cohesion between utter-ances, which is one of the discourse structures intask-oriented spoken dialogues.
We can automati-cally acquire discourse knowledge from an anno-tated corpus with local cohesion.
In this paper wefocus on speech act type-based local cohesion.The presented method consists of two steps ~1)identifying the speech act expressions in an utter-ance and 2) calculating the plausibility of localcohesion between the speech act expressions byusing the dialogue corpus annotated with local co-hesion.
We present wo methods of interpolatingthe plausibility of local cohesion based on surfaceinformation on utterances.
Our method has ob-tained a 93% accuracy for closed data and a 78%accuracy for open data in recognizing a pair of ut-terances with local cohesion.In Section 2, local cohesion in task-orienteddialogues is described.
In Section 3, our statisticalmethod is presented.
In Section 4, the results of aseries of experiments using our method are de-scribed.634--Topics(1) hotel reservation(2) date(3) the number of personsGlobalcohesionILocalcohesioni u--q(1) I--U1 :Heya wo yoyaku shitai-no-desu-gaL (l would like to make a room reservation.)U2:Kashikomari-mashita(OK.

An example of a task-oriented dialogue in Japanese2 Local Cohesion between Utter-ancesThe discourse structure in task-oriented dialogueshas two types of cohesion: global cohesion andlocal cohesion.
Global cohesion is a top-downstructured context and is based on a hierarchy oftopics led by domain (e.g., hotel reservation orflight cancellation).
Using this cohesion, a task-oriented dialogue is segmented into severalsubdialogues according to the topic.
On the otherhand, local cohesion is a bottom-up structuredcontext and a coherence relation between utter-ances, such as question-response or response-con-firmation.
Different from global cohesion, localcohesion does not have a hierarchy.
This paperfocuses on local cohesion.Figure 1 shows a Japanese conversation be-tween a person and a hotel staff member, which isan example of a task-oriented dialogue; The per-son is making a hotel reservation.
The first col-umn represents global cohesion and the secondcolumn represents local cohesion.
For example,the pair of U3 and U4 has local cohesion, becauseit has a coherence relation for each word in theutterances as follows:c 1) speech act pattern between "onegai-itashimasu (requirement)"in U3 and "desu(response)" in U4c2) semantic oherence between ouns,"hinichi (date)"in U3, and "hachi-gatsu to-ka(August 10th)" and "ju-ni-nichi (12th)"in U4In the same way, (U4, U5) and (U5, U6) have lo-cal cohesion.
Thus, U3 to U6 are built up as onestructure and form a subdialogue with the topic"date".As observed from this example, whethertwo utterances have local cohesion with one an-other or not is determined by coherence relationsbetween the speech act types in the utterances, co-herence relations between the verbs in them andcoherence relations between the nouns in them.
Inrecognizing local cohesion, our method uses thesethree coherence relations.3 Our Approach3.1 Utterance Model with Local Co-hesionIn this paper, we approximate an utterance in adialogue to a three-tuple;U = (SPEECH __ ACT, VERB, NOUNS) (1)where SPEECH ACT is the speech act type,VERB is the ma\]-n verb in the utterance, andNOUNS is a set of nouns in the utterance' (e.g., asubject noun and an object noun for the mainverb).
Figure 2 shows a dialogue with our utter-ance model.635U 1 : (SPEECH ACT 1, VERB1, NOUNS1)U 2 = (SPEECH ACT2, VERB 2, NOUNS2)~ U i = (SPEECH ACT i, VERBi, NOUNSi)Uj : (SPEECH _ACTj, VERBj, NOUNSj)Localcohesion?

2nonnegatlve weights contributing to local cohe-sion, and cohesion_speechact, cohesion_verb andcohesion noun are functions giving the plausibil-ity of coherence relations between speech acttypes, verbs and nouns respectively.
The problemof deciding an utterance that has local cohesionwith U. can then be formally defined as finding a Jutterance with the highest plausibility of local co-hesion for Uj, which is the result of the followingfunction:Uopt s = arg max0<i<\]_l cohesion(U i , U\] ) (3)As the first step, this paper uses only speech acttypes in the calculation (i.e.
A t =1, J 2 = J 3 = 0).This is because the speech act types are more pow-erful in finding local cohesion than the verbs orthe nouns as follows:rl) The speech act types are independent ofdomain.r2) The speech act types are stable, while thenouns and the verbs are sometimes omitted inutterances in spoken dialogues.Thus, Equation (2) is reduced to:cohesion_local( U r Uj)= cohesion_speechact(SPEECHACT rSPEECH_ACT) (4)In order to calculate Equation (4), two kinds of in-formation to answer the following questions arerequired as discourse knowledge:q l) What expressions in an utterance indicatesa speech act type?q2) What speech act pattems have localcohesion?We automatically acquire these discourse knowl-edge from a annotated corpus with local cohesion.According to the information, our method is com-posed of two processes, 1) identifying the expres-sions which indicate a speech act type (calledspeech act expressions) in an utterance and 2) cal-culating the plausibility of the speech act patternsby using the dialogue corpus annotated with localcohesion.3.2 Identifying Speech Act Expres-sions in an UtteranceThe first process in our method identifies thespeech act expression in each of the utterances bymatching the longest pattern with the words in aset of speech act expressions.
The words can becollected by automatically extracting fixed ex-pressions from the parts at the end of utterances,because the speech act expressions in Japanesehave two features as follows:f l) The speech act expression forms fixedpatterns.f2) The speech act expressions lie on the partsat the end of the utterance.
For example,"desu" in "Futari desu"(U8) in Figure 1represents a speech act type "response".
Wecall these expressions ENDEXPR expressions.For the automatic extraction, we use a slightmodification of the cost criteria-based method\[Kita 94\], which uses the product of frequencyand length of expressions, because this is easywhen dealing with languages that do not use de-limiters in their writings such as Japanese.
Kita etal.
extract expressions in the order of larger costcriteria values.
We do so in the order of longerfixed-expressions with cost-criteria values abovea certain threshold.
For the more details of our ex-traction method, see \[Katoh 95\].When the ENDEXPR expressions, whichare listed in the set of the speech act expressions(represented as Set-ENDEXPR), are defined as asymbol ENDEXPR, we can approximate thespeech act types as SPEECH ACT=ENDEXPR.Thus, Equation (4) is transfornTed to:cohesion_local( U r ~)= cohesion_speechact(SPEECH_ACT rSPEECH ACT)- -  j= cohesion endexpr(ENDEXPR., ENDEXPR .)

In this pa-per, we define the plausibility of local cohesion,i.e., Equation (5), as follows:cohesion_local( U i, U.
)= cohesion endexpr(ENDEXPRi, ENDEXPRj)= f(ENDEXPR~,ENDEXPRj )- f(ENDEXPRi,ENDEXPRj) (6)wheref (ENDEXPR~, ENDEXPRj )= P(ENDEXPR~ n ENDEXPRj)P( ENDEXPR~ n ENDEXPRj )?
logP( ENDEXPR~ ) ?
P( ENDEXPR j )Df (ENDEXPR,, ENDEXPRj )= P(ENDEXPR~ ~ ENDEXPRj)P( ENDEXPRi n ENDEXPR j )x logP( ENDEXPR i) x P(ENDEXPRj )Thefand f are modified functions of mutual in-formation in Information Theory.
We call thempseudo-mutual information.
P(.)
is the relativefrequency of two utterances with local cohesionand P(.)
is that of two utterances without localcohesion.
ENDEXPR~ (~ ENDEXPR.
means thatENDEXPR: appears next to ENDEXPRz.
We calla series of two ENDEXPR expressions (i.e.,ENDEXPR i 0 ENDEXPRi+I) an ENDEXPRbigram.The htrger the value of Equation (6) in twoutterances gets, the more plausible the local cohe-sion between them becomes.
For example, in ap-plications in speech recognition, the optimal resulthas the largest plausibility value among severalcandidates obtained from a module of speech pat-tern recognition.3.4 Smoothing MethodsAlthough the statistical approach is easy to imple-ment, it has a major problem, i.e., sparse dataproblem.
Indeed Equation (6) gives very smallvalues in some cases.
In order to overcome thisproblem (to interpolate the plausibility), we pro-pose two smoothing techniques.\[Smoothing Method 1\]Interpolate the plausibility by using partial fixedexpressions in Set-ENDEXPR.
For example, inJapanese, "itadake-masu-ka" can be segmentedinto the smaller morpheme "masu-ka" or "ka", andthe original morpheme "itadake-masu-ka" is in-terpolated by these two morphemes as follows:cohesion endexpr(t'itadake-masu-ka ", "desu")= # ocohesion_endexpr("itadake-masu-ka","desu")+/~ 21 cohesion_endexpr("masu -ka", "desu")+ Y 31 cohesion_endexpr("ka", "desu")where flo, #21 and #3t(fZo + f12~ + #31 =1 )are nonnegative parameters.Formally, if we assume the partial fixed expres-sions ENDEXPR .P ~ Set-ENDEXPR andlENDEXPR 51 ~ Set-ENDEXPR, and represent theJ"smaller" as a symbol "<" (e.g., "ka"<"masu-ka"<"itadake-masu-ka"), we can interpolate theoriginal phmsibility by using these smaller mor-phemes:cohesion endexpr(ENDEXPR i, ENDEXPR :)=/x ocohesion_endexpr(ENDEXPR i, END~XPtL)-I- Z /1 Pq cohesion_endexpr(ENDEXPR i,l<_p<_ml<_q<_,, ENDEXPR)whereENDEXPR\] < ENDEXPR.
2 <...< ENDEXPR.
m l !
lENDEXPR \] < ENDEXPR .2 <...< ENDEXPR.nJ J J\[Smoothing Method 2\]Interpolate the plausibility by using the speech acttypes themselves.
For example, "itadake-masu-ka(requirement)" and "desu (response)" are interpo-lated by the relation of the speech act types (notthe speech act expressions), i.e., "requirement-re-sponse", as follows:cohesion endexpr("itadake-masu-ka", "desu")= y ocohesionendexpr("itadake-mas u ka","desu")+ y lCOhesionspeechacttype(req ui ment,response)where/z 0and # 1 (# o + # l = 1 ) are nonnegativeparameters.These speech act types are automatically con-structed by clustering ENDEXPRs based onENDEXPR bigrams, and then the type bigrams arere-calculated from the ENDEXPR bigrams.637Formally, when the speech act types are de-noted by SACT TYPE, we can interpolate anoriginal plausibilhy by using these type patterns:cohesion_endexpr( END EXP R i' END EXP Ri )=/~ ocohesion_endexpr(ENDEXPRi, ENDEXPRj)+/x fohesion speechacttype(SACT TYPE a,SA CT  TYPE b)whereENDEXPR i~ SACTTYPE ,ENDEXPR ~ SA CT_ TYPE hcohesion_speechact_type is a function giving theplausibility of coherence relations between thespeech act types.The former method must use the n Xm parameters(i.e., ,u ~ ) and the latter one must produce the Iqspeech act types.
We chose the former method forour first experiments, because it was easier toimplement.4 ExperimentsA series of experiments was done to evaluate ourmethod.
The experiments were carried out to de-cide whether one utterance and the next one havelocal cohesion with each other or not.
The resultsof the experiment were able to segment a dialogueinto several subdialogues.First, Set-ENDEXPR was constructed au-tomatically by our extraction method for fixed ex-pressions from the ATR speech and language da-tabase \[Morimoto 94\].
The database includesabout 600 task-oriented dialogues concerned withseveral domains, such as hotel reservation, flightcancellation and so on and each of the dialoguesincludes about 50 utterances on average.
We haveextracted about one hundred fixed-expressionsfrom the database by the extraction method.
Table1 shows examples of the fixed expressions.Table 2a.

Then, six dialogues were taken from the60 dialogues to use in testing for the open data,and the rest of the dialogues (54 dialogues) wereused to calculate ENDEXPR bigrams.
Moreover,six dialogues were taken from the 54 dialogues forthe closed data.
Using the 54 dialogues, theENDEXPR bigrams were produced in the follow-ing four parts:An ENDEXPR bigrampart A : with local cohesion + turn-taking.part B : with local cohesion + no turn-taking.part C : without local cohesion + turn-taking.part D : without local cohesion + no turn-taking.where "turn-taking" means that an utterance andthe next one are produced by different persons and"no turn-taking" means that they are done by thesame person.Table 2 shows examples of ENDEXPR bigramswith local cohesion.with local cohesion + turn-taking (part A)relativefrequency.01307.01226.01144.00735.00735ENDPXPR bigramswo-onegai -shimasu kashikomari-mashitadeshou-ka desude-onegai-shimasu kashikomari-mashitadesu-ka desudesu de-gozai-masu-neExamples of ENDEXPR bigrams with local cohesion + no turn-taking (part B)relativefrequency.03063.01685.01225.01225.01072ENDPXPR bigramsdesu desuimasu desushoushou-omachi-kudasaihai desudesu-ne desu-neomatase-itashimashita638Using these ENDEXPR bigrams, a series of ex-periments was done for the closed data.

Us-ing the smoothing method, we obtained a 93.8%accuracy for the closed data and about a 78.4%accuracy for the open data.5 ConclusionWe described our statistical method of recogniz-ing local cohesion between utterances, based onpseudo-mutual information.
We focused onspeech act expressions incalculating the plausibil-ity of local cohesion between two utterances.
Theresults of the first experiments showed a 93% ac-curacy for closed data and a 78% accuracy foropen data.
We conclude that the presented methodwill be effective for recognizing local cohesionbetween two utterances.To improve our method, we will use the co-herence relations in the verbs and set of nouns andwill use a larger corpus with local cohesion.
