Roosevelt, CP 194/6B-1050 Bruxelles, Belgiquevicpoz~isl.vub.ac.beAbstractThis paper is concerned with the question ofhow to extract lexical knowledge from Machine-Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) within a lexi-cal database which integrates a lexicon devel-opment environment.
Our long term objectiveis the creation of a large lexical knowledge baseusing semiautomatic techniques to recover syn-tactic and semantic information from MRDs.In doing so, one finds that reliance on a singleMRD source induces inadequacies which couldbe efficiently redressed through access to com-bined MRD sources.
In the general case, theintegration of information from distinct MRDsremains a problem hard, perhaps impossible, tosolve without the aid of a complete, linguisti-cally motivated atabase which provides a ref-erence point for comparison.
Nevertheless, ad-vances can be made by attempting to correlatedictionaries which are not too dissimilar.
Inkeeping with these observations, we describe asoftware package for correlating MRDs basedon sense merging techniques and show how sucha tool can be employed in augmenting a lexicalknowledge base built from a conventional MRDwith thesaurus information.1 In t roduct ionOver the last few years, the utilization of machine read-able dictionaries (MRDs) in compiling lexical compo-nents for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systemshas awakened the interest of an increasing number of re-searchers.
This trend has largely arisen from the recog-nition that access to a large scale Lexical KnowledgeBase (LKB) is a s ine qua non  for real world applica-tions of NLP systems.
Computer-aided acquisition oflexical knowledge from MRDs can be made to satisfy thisprerequisite in a manner which is both time- and cost-effective.
However, to maximize the utility of MRDs in*The research reported in this paper was carried out atthe Computer Laboratory (University of Cambridge) as partof an ongoing study on the acquisition of lexical knowledgefrom machine-readable dictionaries within the ACQUILEXproject, ESPRIT BRA 3030.NLP applications, it is necessary to overcome inconsis-tencies, omissions and the occasional errors which arecommonly found in MRDs (Atkins el al., 1986; Atkins,1989; Akkerman, 1989; Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989).
Thisgoal can be partly achieved by developing tools whichmake it possible to correct errors and inconsistenciescontained in the information structures automaticallyderived from the source MRD before these are storedin the LKB or target lexicon (Carroll & Grover, 1989).This technique is nevertheless of little avail in redress-ing inadequacies which arise from lack of information.In this case, manual supply of the missing informationwould be too time- and labour-intensive to be desirable.Moreover, the information which is missing can be usu-ally obtained from other MRD sources.
Consider, for ex-ample, a situation in which we wanted to augment lexicalrepresentations available from a conventional dictionarywith thesaurus information.
There can be little doubtthat the integration of information from distinct MRDsources would be far more convenient and appropriatethan reliance on manual encoding.In the general case, the integration of information fromdistinct MRD sources for use within a lexicon develop-ment environment is probably going to remain an un-solved problem for quite some time.
This is simply be-cause dictionaries eldom describe the same word usingthe same sense distinctions.
Consequently, the integra-tion of information from distinct MRD sources throughsimple word-sense matches is likely to fail in a significantnumber of instances (Calzolari & Picchi, 1986; Atkins1987; Klavans 1988; Boguraev & Pustejovsky 1990).
In-deed, Atkins & Levin (1990) have suggested that thetask of mapping MRDs onto each other is so complexthat the creation of a complete 'ideal' database whichprovides a reference point for the MRD sources to be in-tegrated may well be considered as an essential prereq-uisite.
However, when dealing with MRD sources whichuse entry definitions which are not too dissimilar, a cor-relation technique based on word sense merging can bemade to yield useful results, given the appropriate toolsAlthough sense matching across dictionaries in this casetoo is prone to errors, there are several reasons why theeffort is worthwhile.
First, the number of correct sens~matches across MRD sources in this case is guarantee~to be high.
Second, there are many instances in which atincorrect sense-to-sense match does not affect the fins80result since the information with respect o which a sensecorrelation is being sought may generalize across closelyrelated word senses.
Third, a close inspection of infelici-tous matches provides a better understanding of specificdifficulties involved in the task and may help developsolutions.
Finally, the construction of a linguisticallymotivated atabase aimed to facilitate the interrogationof combined MRD sources would be highly enhanced bythe availability of new tools for lexicology.
Partial asit may be, the possibility of mapping MRDs onto eachother through sense-merging techniques hould thus beseen as a step forward in the right direction.The goal of this paper is to describe a software pack-age for correlating word senses across dictionaries whichcan be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user'sneeds, and has convenient facilities for interactive sensematching.
We also show how such a tool can be em-ployed in augmenting a lexical knowledge base built froma conventional MRD with thesaurus information.2 BackgroundOur point of departure is the Lexical Data Base (LDB)and LKB tools developed at the Computer Laboratoryin Cambridge within the context of the ACQUILEXproject.
The LDB (Carroll, 1990) gives flexible accessto MRDs and is endowed with a graphic interface whichprovides a user-friendly environment for query formationand information retrieval.
It allows several dictionariesto be loaded and queried in parallel.| \ [ - 1 ~  Ldoce /_Sem/_ In ter  Ouerquer~jpronIs3AddClearUndoTemplate .

For example, the information needed to buildLKB representations for English verbs (see below) waspartly obtained by running LDB queries which combinedinformation from the Longman Dictionary of Contempo-rary English (LDOCE) and two other dictionaries de-rived from LDOCE: LDOCE_Inter and LDOCE_Sem.LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation programwhich mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entriesinto theoretically neutral intermediate representations(Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989; Carroll & Grover, 1989).LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus termsfrom dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989;Vossen, 1990).
Figure 1 provides an illustrative xampleof an LDB query which combines these MRD sources.We used these LDB facilities for running queries fromcombined MRD sources which included more than oneMRD - -  i.e.
LDOCE and the Longman Lexicon of Con-temporary English (LLOCE), a thesaurus closely relatedto LDOCE.The LKB provides a lexicon development environmentwhich uses a typed graph-based unification formalismas  representation language.
A detailed description ofthe LKB's representation language is given in papersby Copestake, de Paiva and Sanfilippo in Briscoe et al(forthcoming); various properties of the system are alsodiscussed in Briscoe (1991) and Copestake (1992).
TheLKB allows the user to define an inheritance networkof types plus restrictions associated with them, and tocreate lexicons where such types are assigned to lexi-cal templates extracted through LDB queries which giveword-sense specific information.
Consider, for exam-ple, the lexical template relative to the first LDOCEsense of the verb delight in (1) where sense specific infor-mation is integrated with a reference to the LKB typeSTRICT-TRANS-SIGII which provides a general syntacticand semantic haracterization f strict transitive verbs.

a book which is certain to delight them vs. a bookwhich is certain to delight.
Information concerning diathesisalternations i also derived from LDOCElnter.
The valueTRUE for the attribute reg-morph indicates that delight hasregular morphology.
OBJ and E-ItlJI~N are sorted variablesfor individual objects.2According to the verb representation adopted in the LKB(Sanfilippo, forthcoming), verbs are treated as predicates ofeventualities and thematic roles as relations between eventu-alities and individuMs (Parsons, 1990).

For example,information relative to selectional restrictions for tran-sitive verbs (e.g.
e-human and obj in (1)) is encodedby establishing a correspondence b tween the value forthe individual variables of the subject and object rolesin LKB representations and the values retrieved fromthe relevant LDOCE entry for box codes 5 and 10 (seeFigure 1).
Similarly, the assignment of verb types (e.g.STRICT-TRANS-SIGN) to verb senses is carried out by re-lating LKB types for English verbs - -  about 30 in thecurrent implementation (Sanfilippo, forthcoming) - -  tosubcategorization patterns retrieved from LDOCE_Inter.For example, if a verb sense in LDOCE_Inter were asso-ciated with the information in (2), the conversion func-tion would associate the lexical template being generatedwith the type STRICT-TRANS-SIGN.
(2) ((Cat V) (Takes NP NP) ...)Needless to say, the amount of information specified inLKB entries will be directly proportional to the amountof information which can be reliably extracted throughLDB queries.
With respect to verbs, there are severalof roles is computed in terms of entailments ofverb meaningswhich determine the most (p-agt) and least (p-pat) agentiveevent participants for each choice of predicate; see Figures 4and 5 for illustrative xample.
This approach reproduces theinsights of Dowty's and Jackendoff's treatments of thematicinformation (Dowty, 1991; Jackendoff, 1990) within a neo-Davidsonian approach to verb semantics (Sanfilippo, 1990).ways in which the representations derived from tem-plates such as the one in (1) can be enriched.
In thesimplest case, additional information can be recoveredfrom a single MRD source either directly or throughtranslation programs which allow the creation of deriveddictionaries where information which is somehow con-tained in the source MRD can be made more explicit.This technique may however be insufficient or inappro-priate to recover certain kinds of information which arenecessary in building an adequate verb lexicon.
Considerthe specification of verb class semantics.
This is highlyinstrumental in establishing subcategorization a d reg-imenting lexically governed grammatical processes (seeLevin (1989), Jackendoff (1990) and references therein)and should be thus included within a lexicon which sup-plied adequate information about verbs.
For example, averb such as delight should be specified as a member ofthe class of verbs which express emotion, i.e.
psycholog-ical verbs.
As is well known (Levin, 1989; Jackendoff,1990), verbs which belong to this semantic lass can beclassified according to the following parameters:* affect is positive (admire, delight), neutral (experi-ence, interest) or negative (fear, scare)?
stimulus argument is realized as object and experi-encer as subject, e.g.
admire, experience, fear?
stimulus argument is realized as subject and expe-riencer as object, e.g.
delight, interest, scarePsychological verbs with experiencer subjects are 'non-causative'; the stimulus of these verbs can be consideredto be a 'source' to which the experiencer 'reacts emc,tively'.
By contrast, psychological verbs with stimulu,,subjects involve 'causation'; the stimulus argument ma3be consided as a 'causative source' by which the experi.encer participant is 'emotively affected'.
Six subtypes opsychological verbs can thus be distinguished accordintto semantic properties of the stimulus and experience:arguments as shown in (3) where the verb delight is specified as belonging to one of these subtypes.

LDOCE) is a fairly hopele~,pursuit.
Standard dictionaries are simply not equippeto offer this kind of information with consistency anexhaustiveness.
Furthermore, the technique of creatinderived dictionaries where the information contained ia main source MRD is made more explicit is unhel\[ful in this case.
For example, one approach would bscare82to derive a dictionary from LDOCE where verbs are or-ganized into a network defined by IS-A links using thegeneral approach to taxonomy formation described byAmsler (1981).
Such an approach would involve the for-mation of chains through verb definitions determined bythe genus term of each definition.
Unfortunately, thegenus of verb definitions is often not specific enough tosupply a taxonomic haracterization which allows for theidentification of semantic verb classes with consistencyand exhaustiveness.
In LDOCE, for example, the genusof over 20% of verb senses (about 3,500) is one of 8 verbs:cause, make, be, give, put, take, move, have; many ofthe word senses which have the same genus belong todistinct semantic verb classes.
This is not to say thatverb taxonomies are of no value, and in the final sec-tion we will briefly discuss an important application ofverb taxonomies with respect to the assignment of se-mantic classes to verb senses.
Nevertheless, the achieve-ment of adequate results requires techniques which re-classify entries in the same source MRD(s) rather thanmaking explicit the classification 'implicit' in the lexi-cographer's choice of genus term.
Thesauri provide analternative semantically-motivated classification of lexi-cal items which is most naturally suited to reshape oraugment he taxonomic structure which can be inferredfrom the genus of dictionary definitions.
The LLOCEis a thesaurus which was developed from LDOCE andthere is substantial overlap (although not identity) be-tween the definitions and entries of both MRDs.
Wedecided to investigate the plausibility of semi-automaticsense correlations with LDOCE and LLOCE and to ex-plore the utility of the thesaurus classification for theclassification of verbs in a linguistically motivated way.3 DCK:  A F lex ib le  Too l  fo r  Cor re la t ingWord  Senses  Across  MRDsOur immediate goal in developing an environment forcorrelating MRDs was thus to merge word senses, and inparticular verb senses, from LDOCE and LLOCE.
Moregenerally, our aim was to provide a Dictionary Corre-lation Kit (DCK) containing a set of flexible tools thatcan be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user'sneeds, along with a facility for the interactive match-ing of dictionary entries.
Our DCK is designed to cor-relate word senses across pairs of MRDs which havebeen mounted on the LDB (henceforth source-dict anddestination.dict) using a list of comparison heuristics.Entries from the source-dict and destination-dict arecompared to yield a set of correlation structures whichdescribe matches between word senses in the two dictio-naries.
A function is provided that converts correlationstructures into entries of a derived dictionary which canbe mounted and queried on the LDB.3.1 General Functionality of  DCKEntry fields in the source-dict and destination-dict arecompared by means of comparators.
These are func-tions which take as input normalized field informationextracted from the entries under analysis, and returntwo values: a score indicating the degree to which thetwo fields correlate, along with an advisory datum whichindicates what kind of action to take.
The objectiveof each match is to produce a correlation structure con-sisting of a source-dict sense and a set of destination-dictsense/score pairs representing possible matches.
Prior toconverting correlation structures into derived dictionaryentries, the best match is selected for each correlationstructure on the basis of the comparator scores.
Whenthere is ambiguity as to the best match, a correlation di-alog window pops up that allows the user to peruse thecandidate matches and manually select the best match(see Figure 3).3.2 Customis lng  DCKTwo categories of information must be provided in orderto correlate a pair of new LDB-mounted ictionaries:* functions which normalize dictionary-dependentfield values, and* dictionary independent comparators which providematching heuristics.Field values describing the same information may belabeled differently across dictionaries.
For example, pro-nouns may be tagged as Pron in the part-of-speech fieldof one dictionary and Pronoun in part-of-speech field ofanother dictionary.
It is therefore necessary to providenormalizing functions which convert dictionary-specificfield values into dictionary-independent o es which canbe compared using generic comparators.Comparators take as arguments pairs of normalizedfield values relative to the senses of the two MRDs un-der comparison, and return a score associated with anadvisory datum which indicates the course of action tobe followed.
The score and advisory datum provide anindex of the degree of overlap between the two senses.3.3 Determining the Best SenseA correlation structure contains a list of destination-dictsense/score pairs which indicate possible matches withthe corresponding source-dict sense.
The most appro-priate match can be determined automatically using twouser-provided parameters:1. the threshold, which indicates the minimal accept-able score that a comparator list must achieve forautomatic sense selection, and2.
the tolerance, which is the minimum difference be-tween the top two scores that must be achieved ifthe top sense with the highest score is to be selected.The sense/score pair with the highest score is automat-ically selected if:A. the advisory datum provides no indication that thecorrelation should be queried,B.
the score relative to a single match exceeds thethreshold, orC.
the score relative to two or more matches exceedsthe threshold, and the difference between the toptwo scores exceeds the tolerance.If either one of these conditions is not fulfilled, the cor-relation dialog is invoked to allow a manual choice to bemade.83Ldoce Entr~ feel(5), Id: I Ife l l l  / f i : l /  t fe l t  / fe l t /  3 \ [T I ,5 ;U3\ ]  tobel lave,  asp.

A typical interaction can be seen in Fig-ure 3.
A scrollable window in the centre of the dia-log box provides information about the destination-dictsenses and their associated scores.
Single clicking themouse button on one or more rows makes them the cur-rent selection.
The large button above the threshold andtolerance indicators ummarizes source-dict sense infor-mation.
Clicking on this button invokes an LDB querywindow which inspects the source-dict sense (cf.
bottomleft window in Figure 3).The dialog can be in one of three modes:?
Explain Scores - -  the mode specific key pops up awindow for each destination-dict sense in the cur-rent selection, explaining how each score was ob-tained from the comparators;?
Display Entries - -  the mode specific key invokesstandard LDB browsers on the destination-dictsenses in the current selection (cf.
top-left windowin Figure 3), and?
Accept Entries - -  the mode specific key terminatesthe dialog and accepts the current selection as thebest match.Two additional buttons on the top right of the dialog boxallow the current selection to be accepted independentof the current mode, or all senses to be rejected (i.e.no match is found).
At the bottom of the screen, two'thermometers'  allow the user to adjust the thresholdand tolerance parameters dynamically.4 Using DCKWe run DCK with LLOCE as source-dict and LDOCEas destination-dict to produce a derived dictionary,LDOCE_Link, which when loaded together with LDOCEwould allow us to form LDOCE queries which inte-grated thesaurus information from LLOCE.
The workwas carried out with specific reference to verbs whichexpress 'Feelings, Emotions, Attitudes, and Sensations'and 'Movement, Location, Travel, and Transport '  (sets'F '  and 'M'  in LLOCE).
Correlation structures were de-rived for 1194 verb senses (over 1/5 of all verb senses inLLOCE) using as matching parameters degree of overlapin grammar codes, definitions and examples, as well asequality in headword and part-of-speech.
After sometrim runs, correlations appeared to yield best resultswhen all parameters were assigned the same weight ex-cept the comparator for 'degree of overlap in examples'which was set to be twice as determinant than the oth-ers.
Tolerance was set at 7% and threshold at 65%.
Therate of interactions through the correlation dialog wasabout one for every 8-10 senses.
It took about 10 hoursrunning time on a Macintosh I Icx to complete the work,with less than three hours' worth of interactions.A close examination of over 500 correlated entries dis-closed an extremely low incidence of infelicitous matches(below 1%).
In some cases, sense-matching inadequaciescould be easily redressed without reassignment of corre-lation links.
For example, DCK erroneously correlatedthe verb sense for float in LLOCE with the first verbsense of float in LDOCE.
As shown in (4), the LLOCEsense refers only to the intransitive use of the verb, whilethe LDOCE sense refers to both transitive and intransi-tive uses of the verb (i.e.
the LLOCE sense is subsumed84by LDOCE sense).
(4) a LLOCEfloat\[I0\] to stay on or very near thesurface of a liquid, esp.
waterb LDOCEfloat 2 v 1 \[10;T1\] to (cause to) stay atthe top of a liquid or be held up in theair without sinking waterOne way to redress this kind of inadequate match wouldbe to augment DCK with a lexical rule module cater-ing for diathesis alternations which made it possible toestablish a clear relation between distinct syntactic re-alizations of the same verb.
For example, the transitiveand intransitive senses of float could be related to eachother via the 'cansative/inchoative' alternation.
Thisaugmentation would be easy to implement since infor-mation about amenability of verbs to diathesis alterna-tions is recoverable from LDOCE_Inter, as shown belowfor float (Ergative is the term used in LDOCE-Inter tocharacterize verbs which like float are amenable to thecausative/inchoative alternation).

.
.Notice, incidentally, that even though DCK yieldedan incorrect sense correlation for the verb entry float,the information which was inherited by LDOCE fromLLOCE through the correlation link was still valid.
InLLOCE, float is classified as a verb whose set, groupand main identifiers are: floating-and-sinking, Shippingand Movement-location-travel-and-transport.
This infor-mation is useful in establishing the semantic class ofboth the transitive and intransitive uses of float.
Thisis also true in those rare cases where DCK incorrectlypreferred a sense match to another as shown below forthe first LLOCE sense of behave which DCK linkedto the third LDOCE sense rather than the first.
Ei-ther sense of behave is adequately characterized by theset, group and main identifiers 'behaving', Feeling-and-behaviour-generally', and 'Feelings-emotions-attitudes-and-sensations' which LDOCE inherits from LLOCEthrough the incorrect sense correlation established byDCK.

the set identifiers).
The integra-tion of thesaurus information provides adequate meansfor developing a semantic classification of verbs.
Withrespect to psychological verbs, for example, the set iden-tifiers proved to be very helpful in identifying membersof the six subtypes described in (3).
The properties usedin this classification could thus be used to define a hierar-chy of thematic types in the LKB which gave a detailedcharacterization of argument roles.
This is shown in thelattice fragment in Figure 4 where the underlined typescorrespond to the role types used to distinguish the sixsemantic varieties of psychological predicates.
3The correspondence between LLOCE set identifiersand the thematic role types shown in Figure 4 made itpossible to create word-sense templates for psychologicalverbs from LDB queries which in addition to providinginformation about morphological paradigm, subcatego-rization patterns, diathesis alternations and selectionalrestrictions, supplied thematic restrictions on the stimu-lus and experiencer roles.
Illustrative LKB entries rela-tive to the six verb subtypes described in (3) are shownin Figure 5.6 Final RemarksTaking into consideration the size of the LLOCE frag-ment correlated to LDOCE (1/5 of LLOCE verb senses)and the results obtained, it seems reasonable to expectthat this work should extend straightforwardly to otherverbs as well as word senses of different category types.As far as we were able to establish, the major limi-tation of the work carried out arises from the fact thatthe entries and senses per homonyn in the source dictio-nary were considerably fewer than those in the destina-tion dictionary (e.g.
16,049 entries with 25,100 sensesin LLOCE vs. 41,122 entries with 74,086 senses inLDOCE).
Consequently, many senses of correlated verbentries as well as entire verb entries in LDOCE are boundto be left without a specification of thesaurus informa-tion.
We are currently exploring the possibility of us-ing verb taxonomies to extend the results of LLOCE-LDOCE correlations to those LDOCE entries and verb3The labels 'p-agt' and 'p-pat' are abbreviations for'proto-typica\]' gent and patient roles which subsume clustersof entailments of verb meanings which qualify the most andleast agentive vent participants for each choice of predicate(see footnote 2).85th-alfected th-reacUve th-sentlent Is th-soume p-pat p-_agt \.

The basic idea is to derive top- LLOCE set identifiers across verb senses where appropri-down taxonomies using as parent nodes verb entries for ate - -  and let the daughter nodes of these taxonomie~,inherit the thesaurus pecifications associated with th(86parent nodes.
We expect that this use of verb taxon-omy should provide a significant solution for the lack ofsense-to-sense correlations due to differences in size.AcknowledgementsWe are indebted to Ted Briscoe, John Carroll andAnn Copestake for helpful comments and technical ad-vice.
