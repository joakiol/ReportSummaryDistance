THE SOLACEAs  a shor tcut  towards  a lex icon  o freasonab le  coverage  we dec ided  tobuild upon an available machinereadable dictionary, which we intendto augment later by hand and fromother sources.
Our primary source ofEnglish lexical data is now CUVOALD,or  the Expanded Computer UsableVersion of the Oxford AdvancedLearner's Dictionary of  Cul.rentEnglish, 3rd edition (OALD, Hornby,1974), w}Kch is available from OxfordText Archive (see Mitten, 1986) 4 .CUVOALDIists all headwords, headwordvariants and derivatives with simplecodes denoting word classes andinflection patterns, supplemented byverb pattern codes for verbs.
Sensedistinctions from OALD are notretained.Where~q the  der ivat ion  o f  lex ica lin fo rmat ion  as  needed by  the  ana lys i sf rom CUVOALD word  c lass  codes  isre la t ive ly  s t ra ight fo rward ,  the  OALDverb  pat tern  codes ,  wh ich  are  c ruc ia lfor our purpose, present a realchallenge.
The dictionary classifiesverbs according to the number and formof complements in%~ 51 "verbpat terns" ,  marked  by  numbers  1-25 ,supplemented in some cases by letters(4A,4B,4C,4D,4F).
The number of verbsin a single pattern is quite variable:starting from a single item in \[VP4F\]for he followed by an infinitive up to4855 standard transitive verbs in\[VP6A\].
A pattern groups togetherverbs which exhibit the same behaviourin a standard context and are subjectto the same set of transfor~tionsunder  spec i f ied  cond i t ions .
So  e.g .the  c lass  o f  in t rans i t ive  verbs\[ VP2A\ ]  can  take  in t roductory  there  andpostpone the subject if it isindefinite and "heavy" : There comesa time when we feel we must makea protest.
A single pattern is alsoused for verbs which allow the samemot phesyntactic variations ofa complement.
( \[VPI\] : She's dark~ingood heal th/here/a pretty girl.
)A different verb pattern is, however,used if only a subset of the relevantclass perndLs  the variation.
( \ [VP6C\] :She en~oys swimmir~g / * to  swim.
vs.\[VP6D\] : She likes swim~ting / to swim.

(b) I expected him to see the monster.
(c) I elected him to see the monster.
(d) I told him to see the monster.Following Quirk et al (1985,p.1216), the verb is monotransitive in(a) ,  complex-transitive in (b) and(c), and ditransitive in (d).
Theexample (b) is closer to the mono-transitive type while (c) is closer tothe ditransitive type.If we have the subcategorization listSC < \[1\] N\[nom\]4 , \[2\] N\[acc\ ]5  ,\[3\] V\[inf, SC<Ns>\]6 >to express the superficial identity ofall the four cases, we can assume theabove verbs to have the followingsyntactic frames:(a) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJ\[3\]\](b) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJI2\], OBJCOMPL\[3\]\](c) SF \[SUBJ\[1\], OBJ\[2\], OBJCOMPL\[3\]\](d) SF \[SUBJ\[I\], OBJ\[3\], OBJ212\]\]The difference between the types (a)and (b) vs. (c) and (d) is thatbetween the Raising and Equi types.Therefore, (b) will have only twoparticipants at the level of under-ly ing structure while (c) will havethree:(a) US \[ACr 14\], PAT \[6\]\](b) US \[ACT \[4\] ,  PAT \[6\]\](c) US \[ACT \[4\],  PAT \[5\] ,  EFF \[6\]\](d) US \[ACT \[4\],  PAT \[6\] ,  ADDR \[5\]\]The respective templates will be:(a) transitive, 3inf , raising(b) complex-transitive, 3inf , raisin~(c) complex-transitive, 3inf , equi(d} di trensi tive, 3inf , equiA problem remains bow to derivesuch information from OAL/T s verbpatterns.5.

Where possible,frequently co-occurring verb patternsare collapsed into a single paradigmwith local disjuction, e.g.
\[VP61)\] and\[VPTA\] for like (swimming/ to swim)give the following template:\[ transitive, { 2ing / 2inf }, equi \],which expands into:SC < \[I\] N \ [nomb ,\[ 21 V\[{prespartl inf} ,SC<N3>\]4 > ,SF \[ suB J  \[11 , OBJ lZ l  \] ,US \[ GOV l i ke  , ACI' \[3\] , PAT \[4\]  \]Now t~re  are two possible strat-egies representing two extremes.

P~SPM\[rr \ ]A~Lexicon and gram,~r together formthe basis for the extraction of lexi-cal and structural correspondences.Other tools are necessary, however,and we are currently designing speci-fications for such tools.Besides the non-trivial task oftext cleanup, for which no specialtools will be used, two major needsremain: text unit align,~nt and dataextraction methods.Automatic text unit alignment (onword, phrase, and sentence level ) isalso non-trivia/.
On the sentencelevel, we will employ a method foral igpmlent based on sentence length( Gale 1991 ), for which we havedeveloped a f\]exible front-end forrecognizing sentence houndaries.
Weare considering an extension ofChurch's algorithm taking into accountlexicon-based elementary word corres-pendences (as in Kay (1988) and Cati-zone et al (1991) ) for betteraccuracy, but this extension has notbeen implemented yet.Methods for data extraction arestill under development.
