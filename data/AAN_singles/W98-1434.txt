It isdeveloped to generate the multilingual text of the weather forecasts automatically.
The raw datafrom the weather observation can be used to generate the weather element chart.
According to theweather change trend, the forecasters can directly modify the value Of the element on the chart,such as the center .point value, the isoline and the isocircle.
After ?that, the modified data arestored as the input for the system.
The system can select a schema depending on the input or therequirement from the users.
The schema library can be conveniently maintained, such as theschema modification or extension.
Through optimizing and mapping the schema ?tree, themicroplanner constructs the brief and coherent internal text structure for the surface generator.After the processing of the generator, the muitilingual ?weather forecasts used for the broadcastprogram are generated.Keywords:  Multilingual Generation, Weather Forecast Assistant.. ,  1 IntroductionThe MLWFA ~system is developed as the first application of the project ACNLG \[Huang etal.
97a & b\] which is an international ?cooperation between the German Research Center forArtificial Intelligence (DFKI) and Shanghai?
?Jiao Tong University (SJTU).
The system mainlyconsists of four components: the graphic processor, the macroplanner, the microplanner and thesurface generator.
The graphic, ?processor is  used to adjust weather forecasts data by theforecasters.
The technique ?adopted for the macroplanner is based on the schema approach\[McKeown 85\], but we expand the operator of schema.
The microplanner is based on thesentence structure optimizing which is independent of the language and language resource mapping-which is associated with the language.
On the basis of the FB-LTAG (Feature-based Lexicalized-Tree Adjoining Grammar) \[Joshi 85, XTAGRG 95\], the surface generator identifies the feature ofthe nodes, compounds the grammar-trees and finally generates Chinese, ?English and Germanweather forecasts.2 ArchitectureThe architecture of the system is shown in figure 1.
The macroplanner obtains originalpredicted weather data either from the interface or from the users.
These data mainly includeweather status, wind direction, wind force, temperature and so on.In the stag e of macroplanning, we adopt the schema pproach and introduce the "It" operator?
which indicates that the order of the predicates can be exchanged.
The macroplanning procedure296IIIIiJIi'lsIi|i!i!!IIiI!
!IiIIIIIcontains five major steps: inputting meteorological data, building knowledgebase dynamically,initializing predicate, selecting schema nd filling schema \[Wang et al 97\].The users can dynamically define objects and input their property value.
Then the system willdynamically build a hierarchical knowledgebase.
With the help of that, the system transformsoriginal data to the conceptual value.
After producing the conceptual value, the system initializesthe predicates with the conceptual value.
The process of initialization is to fill the conceptualvalue in thepredicate by matching the semantics of the conceptual value and tl~e argument.
Weadd the layout information on the predicate and define some valid argument combinations thatenhance the expressible ability of the predicate.
In the macroplanner, System selects chemaaccording to three conditions.
There are selecting information carried by the schema item, biggrain information that is deduced by several conceptual values according to the domain conditionsand the selecting priority.input and requirement s fromuserssoeol 1 MacroplarmerLanguage I \[Resource ~-~ MicroplannerKnowledge I I " " 'Mult ilingdat TextInternal StructureL I Language" IOptimizingIKnowledgel Libra DI Grammat , ~ 1 Flule ~ Surface Gener~or\ [ L ib rary \ [ \ [  Mult,i~gualTextMachine3ict io naryFig.
1 MLWFA System ArchitectureThe work of the microplanner can be divided into two closely related parts: the sentencestructure optimizing (SSO) and the language resources mapping (LRM).
SSO aims at removingredundant information in the schema tree so as to make the sentence natural, fluent, and readable,and a semantic-based rule driven method is adopted in this component.
LRM adds the functionwords into it in conformity to the specific language syntax, and enriches them with the specificlanguage resources so that every expression i  the output is flexible and grammatically correct.In accordance with the weather forecast domain, 5 types of optimizing tasks are classified:the3' are the aggregation of the proposition with the common parts, the constitute conjoining, the297domain restriction, theconstitute omission and the reference planning.
Each stands for a group ofthe optimizing operations.
In this idea SSO can be confined within the semantic level which isirrelevant with any specific language, so a single operation can be done for all languages.As to LRM, the sentence structure classes are used to represent he detailed Sentencestructures as well as the syntax and semantic nformation for every composition of the sentence.There are several sentence structure classes defined for every predicate.
Considering textrequirements, one of the classes above is chosen and determined to construct he correspondingtext structure tree.
Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the different language, thedynamic information is added to the relevant nodes of  the tree.
As the definition differs widely fordifferent arget languages, we implement this module for different languages respectively.The input of surface generator is the output of the microplanner, which is a dependent treestructure including not only the information of the text content, the sentence syntax nd thesentence semantics, but also the result of the optimizing.?
We have used the FB-LTAG as a generation grammar for our generator [Yao et al 97, Wang97].
The algorithm of the surface generator can be summarized as:?
Instantiate the trees and compute all legal subtree compositions;?
Pick out the first ?tree from the set of acceptable derived trees, which satisfies the featureconstraints and has a complete structure;?
?
Traverse the selected tree and output the Sentences (do some morphology according tothe ?feature values, if necessary)..3 Demonst ra t ionThe main window of the system during the macroplanning is shown in figure 2.L :~oI xl; i~ ~rldi?t%?

2 The Main WindowAt the top of the screen is the main menu of the system.
In the system submenu the user canmaintain all the database in the system.
In the data submenu the system can generate Chinese,English or German text, through executing the macroplanning, the microplanning and the surfacegeneration procedure in turn.
In the prediction submenu the user can change options of thesystem, either produce forecasts step by step or do it uninterruptedly.
The left window on themiddle of the screen shows the weather element chart, the user can modify the element value onthe chart of that window directly.
The right window shows the result of the macropianning, wesplit that window into two parts: One shows the tree structure of the macroplanning result; the298IIIIIIIIIIII?Iother shows the detail information of the focusing node.4 ConclusionWe have implemented a prototype of MLWFA system consisting of four components inVC++ under Windows 95.
Currently we are replenishing more optimizing rules and sentencestructure classes, and further modifying some existing ones.
After doing that, we will plan to putthis prototype into test use.Acknowledgements We want to thank sincerely Dr, Xiaorong Huang for his concreteinstruction and valuable suggestion.
