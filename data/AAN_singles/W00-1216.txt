Text meaning representa-tion is composed of a set of ontological conceptinstances along with ontological links amongthem.
It integrates lexical, textual and worldknowledge into a single hierarchical frame-work.
In NLP application it serves as an inter-lingual representation for various processing.The methodology and implementation of textmeaning representation is discussed in detail.11 In t roduct ionIn natural language text processing, it be-comes inevitable to require a system havingcapability to automatically extract and repre-sent the information conveyed in a given text.The theory and methodology of text mean-ing representation (TMR) has been studiedin the past decade (Nirenburg, 1991; Ma-hesh and Nirenburg, 1996; Beale et al, 1995;Onyshkevych 1997) and its application hasbeen presented in machine translation sys-tems that employ interlingual approach.
Anideal text meaning representation will be alanguage-neutral description of the linguisticinformation conveyed in a natural languagetext.
TIVIR captures the meanings of words inthe text and represents them in a set of onto-logical concepts interconnected through onto-logical relations.
In a~:ldition, TMR providesinformation about the lexicon-semantic de-pendencies as well as stylistic factors.
Basedon this study, two supportive resources tocompose TMR are ontology and semantic lex-icon.
An ontology is a set of knowledge con-cepts about the world.
It is composed of thou-l This work has been supported by the Departmentof Defense of the United States under contract numberMDA-904-92-C,-5189.sands of concepts organized into a particularhierarchy so that each concept is related toother concepts through semantic links (Car lson et aI., 1990; Bateman, 1993; Dowellet al1995; Nirenburg et al, 1995; Bouaud, et al1995; Mahesh et al 1995;).
Semantic lexiconrepresents the senses of the words.
Each lex-icon entry is a framework that maps a wordsense to an ontological concept.
It also in-dudes information about syntax, semantics,morphology and pragmatics, as well as anno-tation that keep the record of data manage-ment.
Over the years, various methodologieshave been investigated carrying out the struc-ture of a computational lexicon entry within aknowledge-based framework(Onyshkevych etaI, 1995; Viegas and Raskin, 1998; Viegas:1999; Viegas, et a/, 1998a, 1998b).
A semanticparser uses information in the semantic lex/-con and makes a decision on word sense dis-ambiguation based on the strategy proposedby Beale et aI.
(1995) and Beale(1997).This paper presents the development andapplication of text meaning representationfor Chinese.
Detailed discussion about theprinciple for building a computational se-mantic Chinese lexicon is illustrated in Jin(1999).
The methodology and implementa-tion of word sense disambiguation is fully dis-cussed in Viegas, Jin and Beale(1999a: 1999b,1999c).2 Overview of OntologyAn ontology is a body of knowledge aboutthe world.
It is a repository of concepts usedin meaning representations.
All concepts areorganized in a tangled subsumption hierar-chy and further interconnected using a systemof semantic relations defined among the con-cepts.
The ontology is put into well-defined109relationships with knowledge sources in thesystem.
In an NLP  application the ontologysupplies world knowledge to lexical, syntactic,semantic and pragmatic processes.In the MikroKosmos project, 2 the ontolog-ical concepts consist of: OBJECT, the staticthings existing in the world; EVENT, any ac-tivities happening in the world, and PROP-ERTY, the properties of OBJECTs and EVENTs.The ontology organizes terminologicalnounsinto a taxonomy of objects, verbs into a taxon-omy of events, and adjectives into a taxonomyof attributes.
It further includes many onto-logical relations between objects and eventsto support a variety of disambiguation tasks.Currently, the ontology in the IVIikroKosmosproject contains about 5,000 concepts cover-ing a wide range of categories in the world.Each concept, on average, has 14 relationlinks.
An example below presents the topthree level of the ontology, which differentiatesbetween OBJECT; EVENT and PROPERTY.+ ALL+EVENT+ MENTAL-EVENT+ PHYSICAL-EVENT+ SOCIAL-EVENT+ OBJECT+MENTAL-OBJECT+ INTANGIBLE-OBJECT+ PHYSICAL-OB/ECT+ SOCIAL-OBJECT+ PROPERTY+ ATTRIBUTE+ RELATION+ 0NTOLOGY-SLOTEach concept is a frame in which a col-lection of ontological slots such as DEFINI-TION, IS-A, SUBCLASSES, INVERSE~ case rolessuch as AGENT,  THEME and properties suchas HEADED-BY, HAS-MEMBER, etc.
link oneconcept to other concepts in the ontology.Below is an example of a concept frame ofGOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY:2The MikroKosmos project is a knowledge-basedmachine translation system using an interHngual p-proach.
The so~ce languages are Spanish, Chineseand Japanese.
The target language is English.Concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITYDEFINITION: an activity commonlycarried out by agovernment.IS-A: POLITICAL-EVENTAGENT:  HUMANTHEME: EVENT OBJECTACCOMPANIER: HUMANLOCATION: PLACEThis example indicates that the conceptGOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY is a subclass ofthe concept POLITICAL-EVENT~ its case roleAGENT requires its semantic value as HUMANand its THEME requires its value as either OB-JECT or EVENT~ the GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITYcan also have case role ACCOMPANIER withvalue as HUMAN and LOCATION with value asPLACE.
Any lexicon entry mapping to the con-cept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY gets extendedinformation through this frame.3 Semant ic  Lex iconSemantic lexicon is another knowledge sourcefor text meaning representation.
In theM.ikroKosmos project each lexicon entry is de-signed as a frame with 11 zones correspondingto information relevant o orthography, mor-phology, syntax, semantics, syntax-semanticlinking, stylistics, and database type manage-ment record, etc.
The core of the lexiconframe is syntactic zone SYN-STRUC, semanticzone SEM-STRUC and their link SYNSEM zone.Syntax particular to a given language is de-scribed in the syntactical zone.
The semanticzone maps a sense into an ontological conceptin the case of single sense, or to several con-cepts in the case of multiple senses.
Throughthe syntactic-semantic link zone the informa-tion of each word in the text can be extracteddirectly from lexicon database and its relevantworld knowledge also can be retrieved.
Thegeneral template of semantic lexicon entry isshown as follows.
For a detailed descriptionsee Viegas and l~k in  (1998).Entry Elements =\[FORM: Word FormCAT: Part of speechMORPH: MorphologyANNO: AnnotationTRANS: Translation110SYNSEM:SYR-STRUC:SEM-STRUC:LEX-RULES:PRAGM:STYL:Syn1;ax-Semant ic linkSyntactic strucCureSemant ic sl;ructureLexical rulesPragmatic informationStylistic informazion\]'~k-Vlsyn: I~jb.j t: \ [ \ ]  : ~\]\[cat: NP\]I: \[\]\[cat: NP\]Jsere :;ynsem:IT G?vernment-Activity an 1AGENT: ~-l HumHEME: ~-~ Object J:bj ubj: E\]\[ sere: \[~\]1\]: ~\[se~: \ ] JFigure 1: Sense for the Chinese lexicon ~k .Figure 1. is a simplified structure of aChinse lexicon entry ~k  in the sense of{GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY.
The SYN zone in-dicates that when parsing a sentence contain-ing this entry, subcategories SUBJ and OBJ arerequired.
The SEM zone presents the semanticvalue of each case role, i.e.
AGENT with valueHUMAN, and TttEM~ with value EVENT or OB-JECT.
The SYNSEM zone provides informationabout the syntax-semantic linking.
That is,SUBJ \ [ \ ]  is linked to AGENT ~-l with valueHUMAN and OBJ \[\] is linked to THEblEwith value EVENT or OBJECT.Due to the lack of morphological informa-tion in Chinese, it is often the case that thesame Chinese word form can be mapped toa different part of speech and has multiplesenses, such as the word ~:g~:?
in the context ~:~ ~:~ flowers bloom,can be an intransitive verb mapping toa concept BLOOM with the definition toproduce flower.?
in the context ~ ~k  ~ ~ ~ thegovernment opens the foreign trade pol-icy, can be a transitive verb mapping toa concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY withthe definition an activity that is com-monly carried out by a government at anylevel.?
in the context ~ ~ ~k ~ the gov-ernment carries open policy, can be anadjective mapping to OPEN-TO-PUBLICwith the definition to be available to thepublic.?
in the context I~ l~ ~k the library isopen, can be an intransitive verb with thesame concept OPEN-TO-PUBLIC.Using the ontological concepts as the value ofsemantic variables and linking them to syn-tactic variables makes the lexicon very infor-mative.

In addition: ontological con-cepts referred to the semantic zones ofthe lexical entries are instantiated andlinked through ontological relations to es-tablish semantic dependencies.
For ex-ample, the syntactic structure of the textrequires ~k  to be a verb.
Thus: the ADJcategory with sense OPEN-TO-PUBLIC-2-4is rejected.
F rom Figure 2. and Figure3.
both SYN zones indicate an intransi-tive verb that violates the required syn-tax.
Therefore, the concepts BLOOM andOPEN-TO-PUBLIC are also rejected.
Inthe same way, the adverb ~b with senseOUTWARD-5-2 and the verb ~ withsense COMMERCE-EVENT-4-2 are also re-jected because of the violation of requiredPOS.
Finally the ADJ .~  with the senseINTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5-1 and theNOUN ~ with COMMERCE-EVENT-4-1are selected.
After all senses are de-termined: SYN-SEM zone binds all syn-tactic variables with semantic variables,i.e.
SUBJ FEDERATION-I  is bound tothe AGENT of GOVERNMENT-ACT IV ITY -2-2, OBJ LAW-3 is bound to the THEME ofGOVEB_NMENT-ACTIVITY-2-2.?
In the next step, selectional constraintsare retrieved from the ontology.
Individ-ual selectional constraints are checked.
Inthe example, the concept GOVEthNMENT-ACTIVITY requires AGENT to be HUMANand THEME to be EVENT or OBJECT.The lexical information indicates that theSUBJ ~ with sense FEDERATION mustsatisfy the AGENT of GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY with value HUMAN.
An infer-ence rule described below checks the sat-isfaction.
The OBJ ~ with the senseLAW satisfies THEME of GOVERNMENT-112ACTIVITY with value OBJECT.
ThroughIS-A links it is found that LAW is a descen-dant of OBJECT.
Therefore, the semanticconstraints are satisfied.Seeking satisfaction through inferencerules, the semantic analyzer does morethan match selectional constraints or findthe distance along IS-A links.
The searchinside the ontology also involves look-ing for metonymic type links, such asFEDERATION in a metonymic relationwith HUMAN through the property HAS-REPRESENTATIVE:Concep%:IS-A:DOMAIN:RANGE:INVERSE :HAS-REPRESENTATIVEORGANIZATION-RELATIONORGANIZATIONHUMAN BUSINESS-ROLEGOVERNMENTAL-ROLEREPRESENTATIVE-OFin which DOMAIN is ORGANIZATION thathas subclass FEDERATION and RANGE isHUMAN.
Thus, the constraint of AGENTof GOVERNAIENT-ACTIVITY to be HU-MAN is satisfied.?
In case multiple senses all satisfy the con-straints, the concept with the shortestpath is selected as the best choice.
Anontological search program, Onto-Search,is presented in Onyshkevych (1997).
Theresulting preference values for each con-stralnt are combined in an efficient con-trol and search algorithm called Hunter-Gatherer that combines constraint satis-faction~ branch and bound, and solutionsynthesis techniques to pick the best com-bination of word senses of the entire sen-tence in near linear time, as described inBeale (1997).?
Chosen word senses are assembled intoTMR frames.5 Text  Mean ing  Representat ioni text meaning representation(TMR) is alanguage-neutral description of the meaningconveyed in a text.
It is derived by syn-tactic and semantic analysis.
TMR capturesnot only the meaning of individual words inthe text, but also the relation between thosewords.
It provides information about thelexicon-semantic dependencies.
In addition, italso represents stylistic and other factors pre-sented in the text.
From the result of wordsense disambiguation, TMR integrates lexical,ontological and textual information i to a sin-gle hierarchical framework.
Below is a TMRfor the example sentence ~\[\] R~ ~:~ T~ ~ ~ R~.
Chinese government has opened.foreign trade policy.
(FEDERATION-1(AGENT-0F(VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2)(RELATION (VALUE CHINA-6) )(INSTANCE-OF (VALUE FEDERATION) ) )( GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2(AGENT (VALUE FEDERATION-i) )(THEME (VALUE LAW-3))(INSTANCE-OF(VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY) ) )(LAW-3(THmm-0Y(VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) )(INSTANCE-OF (VALUE LAW) ) )(COMMERCE-EVENT-4(EVENT-OBJECT-RELATION (VALUE LAW-3) )(INSTANCE-OF (VALUE COMMERCE-EVENT) )(INTERNATI ONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5(DOMAIN (VALUE COMMERCE-EVENT-4) )(RANGE (VALUE INTmU~ATIONAL))(INSTANCE-OF(VALUE INTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE) ) )(CHINA-6(INSTANCE-OF (VALUE CHINA) ) )(ASPECT-7(SCOPE (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2)(TELIC (VALUE YES) ) )(TIME-8(DOMAIN (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) )(RANGE (VALUE *speaker-time*)))(INFERENCE (TYPE METONYMY)(HUMAN(REPRESENTATIVE-OF(VALUE FEDERATION-1 ) ) ) )After semantic analysis~ a variety of mi-crotheories are applied to further analyze el-ements of text meaning such as time, aspect:propositions, sets, co-reference, and so on..to produce a complete TMR.
In the exam-ple, ASPECT-7 is applied within the scopeof GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY in which TELICwith value YES indicates the GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY is complete that means the action113of opening foreign trade policy is done.
TIME-8 indicates the GOVERNMFENT-ACTIVITY hap-pens at the time the speaker make the ut-terance.
Thus, the meaning of the Chinesesentence ~H\] ~ ~ ~ 3" ~t"  ~ ~ iscompletely represented in the TlVIR.6 Discuss ionA knowledge-based machine translation canbe viewed as extracting and representing themeaning of a text and generating a text intarget language based on the meaning pre-sented.
Thus, text meaning representationplays the key role in an interlingual approachto machine translation.
The approach de-scribed in this article enables integrating lin-guistic knowledge of source languages withgeneral world knowledge to reach high qual-ity translation.
It is because TMR representsmeaning deeper and broader than what thecontext presents.
For example, in the con-text ~.
~9~ provide service, the linguisticinformation indicates yntactic-semantic de-pendency as SUBJ (human) -V(service-event)-OBJ(event).
In an ontology, the SERVICE-EVENT concept frame contains informationabout AGENT and THEME as well as BENEFI-CIARY, ACCOMPANIEtL INSTRUMENT, LOCA-TION, etc.
which extends the meaning of thegiven text ~ ~ to lEA.
:~ ~ ~ i~,A.~.
~ ~ Someone provides service to someoneelse at some place.
If the extended informa-tion is not explicitly presented in the text, thedefault value provides the assumption basedon the world knowledge.
In machine transla-tion, it enables the generation of high qualitytext, especially in the case where the syntaxin source language is different from that intarget language or in the case where ellipsisis allowed in one language such as He playsBach in English, but is not allowed in otherlanguage such as in Chinese, where one mustsay ~ ~ ~ fi.\] ~ ~ He plays Bach's work.With the rapid development of internet, in-formation retrieval plays the key role in searchengin.
The extended information about theworld knowledge allows to retrieve relevantdata through the ontology that is implicitlyspecified in the query.
As result, more broadand deep information can be extracted.
It isextremely valuable to the development of nextgeneration of internet search engin.
