Annotation Graphs as a Framework forMultidimensional Linguistic Data AnalysisSteven  B i rd  and Mark  L ibermanLinguistic Data Consort ium, University of Pennsylvania3615 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104-2608, USA{ sb, myl}?Idc,  upenn, eduAbst rac tIn recent work we have presented a formalframework for linguistic annotation based onlabeled acyclic digraphs.
These 'annotation graphs'offer a simple yet powerful method for representingcomplex annotation structures incorporatinghierarchy and overlap.
Here, we motivate andillustrate our approach using discourse-levelannotations of text and speech data drawn fromthe CALLHOME, COCONUT, MUC-7, DAMSLand TRAINS annotation schemes.
With the helpof domain specialists, we have constructed a hybridmulti-level annotation for a fragment of the BostonUniversity Radio Speech Corpus which includesthe following levels: segment, word, breath, ToBI,Tilt, Treebank, coreference and named entity.
Weshow how annotation graphs can represent hybridmulti-level structures which derive from a diverseset of file formats.
We also show how the approachfacilitates substantive comparison of multipleannotations of a single signal based on differenttheoretical models.
The discussion shows howannotation graphs open the door to wide-rangingintegration oftools, formats and corpora.1 Annotation GraphsWhen we examine the kinds of speech transcriptionand annotation found in many existing 'communi-ties of practice', we see commonality of abstractform along with diversity of concrete format.
Oursurvey of annotation practice (Bird and Liberman,1999) attests to this commonality amidst diversity.
(See \[~.idc.upenn.edu/annotation\] for pointers toonline material.)
We observed that all annotationsof recorded linguistic signals require one unavoidablebasic action: to associate a label, or an orderedsequence of labels, with a stretch of time in therecording(s).
Such annotations also typically distin-guish labels of different types, such as spoken wordsvs.
non-speech noises.
Different types of annota-tion often span different-sized stretches of recordedtime, without necessarily forming a strict hierarchy:thus a conversation contains (perhaps overlapping)conversational turns, turns contain (perhaps inter-rupted) words, and words contain (perhaps hared)phonetic segments.
Some types of annotation aresystematically incommensurable with others: thusdisfluency structures (Taylor, 1995) and focus struc-tures (Jackendoff, 1972) often cut across conversa-tional turns and syntactic onstituents.A minimal formalization of this basic set of prac-tices is a directed graph with fielded records on thearcs and optional time references on the nodes.
Wehave argued that this minimal formalization i facthas sufficient expressive capacity to encode, in areasonably intuitive way, all of the kinds of linguis-tic annotations in use today.
We have also arguedthat this minimal formalization has good propertieswith respect to creation, maintenance and searchingof annotations.
We believe that these advantagesare especially strong in the case of discourse anno-tations, because of the prevalence of cross-cuttingstructures and the need to compare multiple anno-tations representing different purposes and perspec-tives.Translation i to annotation graphs does not mag-ically create compatibility among systems whosesemantics are different.
For instance, there are manydifferent approaches to transcribing filled pauses inEnglish - each will translate asily into an annota-tion graph framework, but their semantic ncompati-bility is not thereby erased.
However, it does enableus to focus on the substantive differences withouthaving to be concerned with diverse formats, andwithout being forced to recode annotations in anagreed, common format.
Therefore, we focus on thestructure of annotations, independently of domain-specific concerns about permissible tags, attributes,and values.As reference corpora are published for a widerrange of spoken language genres, annotationwork is increasingly reusing the same primarydata.
For instance, the Switchboard corpus\ [~ .

cis.
upenn, edu/'treebank/swit chboard-sample .html\] for an example, which also includes aseparate part-of-speech annotation and a Treebank-Style annotation.
Hirschman and Chinchor (1997)give an example of MUC-7 coreference annotationapplied to an existing TRAINS dialog annotationmarking speaker turns and overlap.
We shallencounter a number of such cases here.The FormalismAs we said above, we take an annotation label tobe a fielded record.
A minimal but sufficient set offields would be:type this represents a level of an annotation, suchas the segment, word and discourse levels;label this is a contentful property, such as a par-ticular word, a speaker's name, or a discoursefunction;class this is an optional field which permits thearcs of an annotation graph to be co-indexedas members of an equivalence class.
*One might add further fields for holding comments,annotator id, update history, and so on.Let T be a set of types, L be a set of labels, andC be a set of classes.
Let R = {(t,l,c) I t 6 T, l  6L, c 6 C}, the set of records over T, L, C. Let N bea set of nodes.
Annotation graphs (AGs) are nowdefined as follows:Definit ion 1 An annotat ion graph G over R, Nis a set of triples having the form (nl, r, n~), r e R,nl, n2 6 N, which satisfies the following conditions:1.
(N,{(nl,n2) l <nl,r, n2) 6 A}) is a labelledacyclic digraph.2.
T : N ~ ~ is an order-preserving map assigningtimes to (some o/) the nodes.For detailed discussion of these structures, see(Bird and Liberman, 1999).
Here we present a frag-ment (taken from Figure 8 below) to illustrate thedefinition.
For convenience the components of thefielded records which decorate the arcs are separatedusing the slash symbol.
The example contains twoword arcs, and a discourse tag encoding 'influenceon speaker'.
No class fields are used.
Not all nodeshave a time reference.1We have avoided using explicit pointers ince we prefernot to associate formal identifiers to the arcs.
Equivalenceclasses will be exemplified later.The minimal annotation graph for this structure isas follows:T = {w,.
}L = {oh, okay, IOS:Commit}C = 0N = {1,2,3}r = {<1,52.46},(3,53.14}}(l,Wlohl,2>,A = (2, W/okay/,3),(1, DnOS: Comm~/, 3> }XML is a natural 'surface representation' forannotation graphs and could provide the primaryexchange format.
A particularly simple XMLencoding of the above structure is shown below;one might choose to use a richer XML encoding inpractice. "

Thetranscripts exhibit abundant overlap betweenspeaker turns.
What follows is a typical fragmentof an annotation.
Each stretch of speech consists ofa begin time, an end time, a speaker designation,and the transcription for the cited stretch of time.We have augmented the annotation with + and *to indicate partial and total overlap (respectively)with the previous peaker turn.\ [~@ - .~  w,.

the period from 972.46 to 989.56seconds) were broken up into shorter stretches forthe convenience of the annotators and to provideadditional time references.
A section of this anno-tation which includes an example of total overlap isrepresented in annotation graph form in Figure 1,with the accompanying visualization shown in Fig-ure 2.
(We have no commitment to this particularvisualization; the graph structures can be visualizedin many ways and the perspicuity of a visualizationformat will be somewhat domain-specific.
)The turns are attributed to speakers using thespeaker /  type.
All of the words, punctuation anddisfluencies are given the w/type, though we couldeasily opt for a more refined version in which theseare assigned ifferent ypes.
The class field is notused here.
Observe that each speaker turn is a dis-joint piece of graph structure, and that hierarchicalorganisation uses the 'chart construction' (Gazdarand Mellish, 1989, 179ff).
Thus, we make a logi-ca\] di.stinction between the situation where the end-points of two pieces of annotation ecessarily coin-cide (by sharing the same node) from the situationwhere endpoints happen to coincide (by having dis-tinct nodes which contain the same time reference).The former possibility is required for hierarchicalstructure, and the latter possibility is required foroverlapping speaker turns where words spoken bydifferent speakers may happen to sharing the sameboundary.2.2 Dialogue Annotation in COCONUTThe COCONUT corpus is a set of dia\]ogues in whichthe two conversants collaborate on a task of decidingwhat furniture to buy for a house (Di Eugenio et al,1998).
The coding scheme augments the DAMSLscheme (Allen and Core, 1997) by having some newtop-level tags and by further specifying some exist-ing tags.
An example is given in Figure 3.The example shows five utterance pieces, identi-fied (a-e), four produced by speaker S1 and one pro-duced by speaker $2.
The discourse annotations canbe glossed as follows: Accept - the speaker is agreeingto a possible action or a claim; Comit - the speakerpotentially commits to intend to perform a futurespecific action, and the commitment is not contin-gent upon the assent of the addressee; Offer - thespeaker potentially commits to intend to perform afuture specific action, and the commitment is contin-gent upon the assent of the addressee; 0pen-0ption- the speaker provides an option for the addressee'sfuture action; Action-Directive - the utterance isdesigned to cause the addressee to undertake a spe-cific action.In utterance (e) of Figure 3, speaker $1 simul-taneously accepts to the mete-action i  (d) of not3Accept, CommitOpen-OptionAction-DirectiveAccept(d), Offer, CommitSI: (a) Let's take the blue rug for 250,(b) my rug wouldn't match(c) which is yellow for 150.S2: (d) we don't have to match...SI: (e) well then let's use mine for 150Figure 3: Dialogue with COCONUT Coding Schemespl .

The latter acceptance is notexplicitly represented in the original notation, so weshall only consider the former.In representing this dialogue structure Using anno-tation graphs, we will be concerned to achieve thefollowing: (i) to treat multiple annotations of thesame utterance fragment as an unordered set, ratherthan a list, to simplify indexing and query; (ii) toexplicitly link speaker S1 to utterances (a-c); (iii)to formalize the relationship between Accept (d) andutterance (d); and (iv) formalize the rest of theannotation structure which is implicit in the textualrepresentation.We adopt the types Sp (speaker), utt (utterance)and D (discourse).
A more refined type systemcould include other levels of representation, it coulddistinguish forward versus backward communicativefunction, and so on.
For the names we employ:speaker identifiers Sl, s2; discourse tags Offer,Commit, Accept, Open-0ption, Action-Directive; andorthographic strings representing the utterances.For the classes (the third, optional field) we employthe utterance identifiers a, b, c, d, e.An  annotation graph representation of theCOCONUT example can now be represented as inFigure 4.
The arcs are structured into three layers,one for each type, where the types are written onthe left.
If the optional class field is specified, thisinformation follows the name field, separated by aslash.
The Acceptld arc refers to the s2 utterancesimply by virtue of the fact that both share thesame class field.Observe that the Commit and Accept tags for (a)are unordered, unlike the original annotation, andthat speaker $1 is associated with all utterances (a-c), rather than being explicitly linked to (a) andimplicitly linked to (b) and (c) as in Figure 3.To make the referent of the Accept tag clear, wemake use of the class field.
Recall that the thirdcomponent of the fielded records, the class field, per-mits arcs to refer to each other.
Both the referringand the referenced arcs are assigned to equivalenceclass d.2.3 Coreference Annotat ion  in MUC-7The MUC-7 Message Understanding Conferencespecified tasks for information extraction, namedentity and coreference.
Coreferring expressionsare to be linked using SGML markup withID and REF tags (Hirschman and Chinchor,1997).
Figure 5 is a sample of text fromthe Boston University Radio Speech Corpus[~al;.

(We are gratefulto Lynette Hirschman for providing us with thisannotation.
)Noun phrases participating in coreference arewrapped with <coref>...</corer> tags, which canbear the attributes ID, REF, TYPE and MIN.
Each suchphrase is given a unique identifier, which may bereferenced by a REF attribute somewhere lse.
Ourexample contains the following references: 3 --~ 2,4 -+ 2 ,6 -+ 5, 7 -+ 5, 8--~ 5, 12-+ 11, 15 ~ 13.The TYPE attribute ncodes the relationship betweenthe anaphor and the antecedent.
Currently, onlythe identity relation is marked, and so coreferencesform an equivalence class.
Accordingly, our examplecontains the following equivalence classes: {2, 3, 4},{5,6,7,s}, {11, n}, {13,15}.In our AG representation wechoose the first num-ber from each of these sets as the identifier for theequivalence class.
MUC-7 also contains a specifica-tion for named entity annotation.

This problem does not arise in the annota-tion graph formalism; see (Bird and Liberman, 1999,2.7).3 Hybr id  Annotat ionsThere are many cases where a given corpus is anno-tated at several levels, from discourse to phonetics.While a uniform structure is sometimes imposed,as with Partitur (Schiel et al, 1998), establishedpractice and existing tools may give rise to corporatranscribed using different formats for different lev-els.
Two examples of hybrid annotation will be dis-cussed here: a TRAINS+DAMSL annotation~ andan eight-level annotation of the Boston UniversityRadio Speech Corpus.3.1 DAMSL annotation of TRAINSThe TRAINS corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1993) is acollection of about 100 dialogues containing a totalof 5,900 speaker turns \[~,.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/LDC95S25.htral\].

Here, a dialog is broken down into turnsand thence into utterances, where the tags containdiscourse-level annotation.In representing this hybrid annotation as an AGwe are motivated by the following concerns.
First,we want to preserve the distinction between theTRAINS and DAMSL components, o that they canremain in their native formats (and be manipulatedby their native tools) and be converted indepen-dently to AGs then combined using AG union, andso that they can be projected back out if necessary.Second, we want to identify those boundaries thatnecessarily have the same time reference (such asthe end of utterance 17 and the end of the word'Elmira'), and represent them using a single graphnode.
Contributions from different speakers willremain disconnected in the graph structure.
Finally,we want to use the equivalence class names to allowcross-references between utterances.
A fragment ofthe proposed annotation graph is depicted using ourvisualization format in Figure 9.
Observe that, forbrevity, some discourse tags are not represented, andthe phonetic segment level is omitted.Note that the tags in Figure 8 have the form offielded records and so, according to the AG defini-tion, all the attributes of a tag could be put intoa single label.
We have chosen to maximally splitsuch records into multiple arc labels, so that searchpredicates do not need to take account of inter-nal structure, and to limit the consequences of anerroneous code.
A relevant analogy here is that ofpre-composed versus compound characters in Uni-code.
The presence of both forms of a character ina text raises problems for searching and collating.This problem is avoided through normalization, andthis is typically done by maximally decomposing thecharacters.3.2 Multiple annotations of the  BU corpusLinguistic analysis is always multivocal, in twosenses.

Second, thereare many alternative representations or construalsof a given kind of linguistic information.Sometimes these alternatives are simply moreor less convenient for a certain purpose.
Thus aresearcher who thinks theoretically of phonologicalfeatures organized into moras, syllables and feet,will often find it convenient o use a phonemicstring as a representational pproximation.
Inother cases, however, different sorts of transcriptionor annotation reflect different theories about theontology of linguistic structure or the functionalcategories of communication.The AG representation offers a way to deal pro-ductively with both kinds of multivocality.
It pro-vides a framework for relating different categories oflinguistic analysis, and at the same time to comparedifferent approaches to a given type of analysis.As an example, Figure 10 shows an AG-based visualization of eight different sorts ofannotation of a phrase from the BU RadioCorpus, produced by Mari Ostendorf and othersat Boston University, and published by theLDC [~.Idc.upenn.edu/Catalog/LDC96S36.html].The basic material is from a recording of alocal public radio news broadcast.
The BUannotations include four types o f  information:orthographic transcripts, broad phonetic transcripts(including main word stress), and two kinds7of prosodic annotation, all time-aligned to thedigital audio files.
The two kinds of prosodicannotation implement the system known as ToBI\[wvw.

Taylor has done Tilt annotations formuch of the BU corpus, and will soon be publishingthem as a point of comparison with the ToBI tonalannotation.
Tilt differs from ToBI in providing aquantitative rather than qualitative characterizationof F0 obtrusions: where ToBI might say "this is aL+H* pitch accent," Tilt would say "This is an Foobtrusion that starts at time to, lasts for duration dseconds, involves a Hz total F0 change, and ends lHz different in F0 from where it started.
"As usual, the various annotations come in a bewil-dering variety of file formats.
These are not entirelytrivial to put into registration, because (for instance)the TreeBank terminal string contains both more(e.g.
traces) and fewer (e.g.
breaths) tokens than theorthographic transcription does.
One other slightlytricky point: the connection between the word stringand the "break indices" (which are ToBI's character-izations of the nature of interword disjuncture) aremediated only by identity in the floating-point timevalues assigned to word boundaries and to breakindices in separate files.
Since these time values areexpressed as ASCII strings, it is easy to lose theidentity relationship without meaning to, simply byreading in and writing out the values to programsthat may make different choices of internal variabletype (e.g.
float vs. double), or number of decimaldigits to print out, etc.Problems of this type are normal whenever multi-ple annotations need to be compared.
Solving themis not rocket science, but does take careful work.When annotations with separate histories involvemutually inconsistent corrections, ilent omissions ofproblematic material, or other typical developments,the problems are multiplied.
In noting such difficul-ties, we are not criticizing the authors of the annota-tions, but rather observing the value of being able toput multiple annotations into a common framework.Once this common framework is established, viatranslation of all eight "strands" into AG graphterms, we have the basis for posing queries thatcut across the different ypes of annotation.
Forinstance, we might look at the distribution of Tiltparameters as a function of ToBI accent type; orthe distribution of Tilt and ToBI values for initialvs.
non-initial members of coreference sets; or therelative size of Tilt F0-change measures for nounsvs.
verbs.We do not have the space in this paper to dis-cuss the design of an AG-based query formalism atlength - and indeed, many details of practical AGquery systems remain to be decided - but a shortdiscussion will indicate the direction we propose totake.
Of course the crux is simply to be able to putall the different annotations into the same frame ofreference, but beyond this, there are some aspectsof the annotation graph formalism that have niceproperties for defining a query system.
For example,if an annotation graph is defined as a set of "arcs"like those given in the XML encoding in ?1, thenevery member of the power set of this arc set isalso a well-formed annotation graph.
The power setconstruction provides the basis for a useful queryalgebra, since it defines the complete set of possiblevalues for queries over the AG in question, and isobviously closed under intersection, union and rela-tive complement.
As another example, various time-based indexes are definable on an adequately time-anchored annotation graph, with the result thatmany sorts of precedence, inclusion and overlap rela-tions are easy to calculate for arbitrary subgraphs.See (Bird and Liberman, 1999, ?5) for discussion.In this section, we have indicated some of the waysin which the AG framework can facilitate the anal-ysis of complex combinations linguistic annotations.These annotation sets are typically multivocal, bothin the sense of covering multiple types of linguisticinformation, and also in the sense of providing multi-ple versions of particular types of analysis.
Discoursestudies are especially multivocal in both senses, andso we feel that this approach will be especially help-ful to discourse researchers.4 Conc lus ionThis proliferation of formats and approaches can beviewed as a sign of intellectual ferment.
The factthat so many people have devoted so much energy tofielding new entries into this bazaar of data formatsindicates how important the computational study ofcommunicative interaction has become.

We need a way tointegrate these approaches without imposing someform of premature closure that would crush experi-mentation and innovation.Both here, and in associated work (Bird andLiberman, 1999), we have endeavored to showhow all current annotation formats involve thebasic actions of associating labels with stretchesof recorded signal data, and attributing logicalsequence, hierarchy and coindexing to such labels.We have grounded this assertion by definingannotation graphs and by showing how a disparaterange of annotation formats can be mapped intoAGs.
This work provides a central piece of thealgebraic foundation for inter-translatable formatsand inter-operating tools.
The intention is notto replace the formats and tools that have beenaccepted by any existing community of practice,but rather to make the descriptive and analyticalpractices, the formats, data and tools universallyaccessible.
This means that annotation contentfor diverse domains and theoretical models canbe created and maintained using tools that arethe most suitable or familiar to the community inquestion.
It also means that we can get startedon integrating annotations, corpora and researchfindings right away, without having to wait untilfinal agreement on all possible tags and attributeshas been achieved.There are many existing approaches to discourseannotation, and many options for future approaches.Our explorations presuppose a particular setof goals: (i) generality, specificity, simplicity;(ii) searchability and browsability; and (iii)malnfalnability and durability.
These are discussedin full in (Bird and Liberman, 1999, ?6).
Byidentifying a common conceptual core to allannotation structures, we hope to provide afoundation for a wide-ranging integration of tools,formats and corpora.
One might, by analogy totranslation systems, describe AGs as an interlinguawhich permits free exchange of annotation databetween n systems once n interfaces have beenwritten, rather than n 2 interfaces.Although we have been primarily concerned withthe structure rather than the content of annota-tions, the approach opens the way to meaningfulevaluation of content and comparison of contentfuldifferences between annotations, ince it is possibleto do all manner of quasi-correlational analyses ofparallel annotations.
A tool for converting a givenformat into the AG framework only needs to bewritten once.
Once this has been done, it becomesa straightforward task to pose complex queries overmultiple corpora.
Whereas if one were to start withannotations in several distinct file formats, it wouldbe a major programming chore to ask even a simplequestion.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the following people for discus-sions and input concerning the material presentedhere: Chris Cieri, Dave Graft, Julia Hirschberg,Lynette Hirschman, Brian MacWhinney, Ann Tay-lor, Paul Taylor, Marilyn Walker, and three anony-mous reviewers.9IIIReferencesJames Allen and Mark Core.
