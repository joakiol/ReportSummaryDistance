ACQUISITION OF SEMANTIC INFORMATIONFROM AN ON-LINE DICTIONARYNicoletta CALZOLAR1 - Eugenio P ICCHIDipartimento di Linguistica, Universita" di Pisalstituto di Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, PisaVia della l:aggiola 32L56100 P1SA - ITALYAbstractAfter the first work on machine-readable dictionaries(MRDs) in the seventies, and with the recent development ofthe concept of a lexical database (LI)B) in which interaction,flexibility and multidim;ensionality can be achieved, buteverything must be  explicitly stated in advance, a newpossibility which is now emerging is that of a procedmalexploitation of the full range of semantic in!brmation implicitlycontained in MRI)s. The dictionary is considered in thisframework as a prima~'y source of basic general knowledge.
Inthe paper we describe a project to develop a system which hasword-sense acquisition fi'om information contained incomputerized ictionaries and knowledge organization as itsmain objectives.
The approach consists in a discovery proce-dure technique operating on natural anguage delinitions, whichis recursively applied and relined.
We start \[i'om free-textdefinitions, in natural language linear form, analyzing andconverting them into infbrmationally equivalent structuredforms.
This new approach, which aims at reorganizing ti'ee textinto elaborately structured information, could be called theLcxical Knowledge Base (I.KB) approach.1.
BaekgromldFor a cmlsidcrable period in theoretical and computationallinguistics, there was a predominant lack of interest in lexicalproblems, which were regarded as being of minor importancewith respect o "core" issues concerning linguistic phenomena,mainly of a syntactic nature, l)uring the last few years,howevcr, this trend has been ahnost reversed.
The role of thelexicon in both linguistic thcories and computationalapplications is now being greatly revalued and one aspect onwhich a number of research groups are now focussing theirattention is the possibility of reusing the large quantity of datacontained in alrcady existing machine-readable lcxical sources,mainly dictionaries prepared for photocomposition, as a shortcut in the construction of extensive NLl'-oriented lexicons.This position was formulated very clearly in a number of paperspresented at a recent workshop organized in Grosseto (Italy)and sponsored by the European Community (see Walker,Zampolli, Calzolari, furthcoming), and can be found in the setel" recommendations which was one of" the results of thisworkshop (Zampolli 1987, pp.332-335).After the first work on machine-readable dictiona,'ies(MRI)s) in the seventies (see Olney 1972, Sherman 1974), andwith the recent development oI~the concept of'a lexical database(l.l)B) in which interaction, flexibility and multidiinensionalitycan be achieved, but everything must be explicitly stated inadvance (see e.g.
Amsler 1980, Byrd 1983, Calzolari 1982,Michiels 1980), a new possibility which is now emerging is thato1" a procedural exploitation of the lull range of semanticintbrmation implicitly contained in MRI)s (see Wilks 1987,Binot 1987, Alshawi forthcoming, Calzolari forthcoming).\ [he  dictionary is now considered as a prilnary source notonly of lcxical knowledge but also of basic general knowledge(ranging over the entire "world"), and some of tim dictionarysystems which are being developed have knowled~,e acquisitionand knowledge organization as their principal objectives (seealso l.enat al/d \[:eigenbaum 1987).
In this paper we describe atproject which we are now conducting on the acquisition ofsemantic inlbrmation ti'om computerized dictionaries.2.
I)ata and estal)lished methods fiw hierarchic'd semanticclassifyingThe data we use in our research include the lexicalinformation contained in the Italian Machine I)ictionary(I)MI), which is ah'eady structured as a LI)B and is nrainlybased on the Zingarelli Italian dictionary (1970); the DM l-l)Bhas different types o\[" linguistic inIormation already accessibleon-line.
A morphological module generates and analy,'es theintlected word-forms: approximately I million fiom 120,000lemmas, l.cnm/as, word-forms, deriwitivcs/suflixes, POS, usagecodes, and specialized terminology codes, can be used its directaccess search keys through which the user can query thedatabase dictionary.
On the semantic side, synonyms,hyponyms, and hypcrnyms constitute already implementedaccess paths covering all of the approximately 200,000definitions contained in the dictionary.
Examples of possiblequeries arc the lbllowing: give me all the nouns defined asnames of vehicles, of sounds, of games, all the verbs defined bya particular genus term, for example 'M UOVEII.E' (to move),'TAGLIARI.
:' (to cut), etc.
The procedures used to findB7hypernyms in definitions and to create taxonomies are similarto those used by other groups (see Chodorow 1985, Calzolari1983, Amslcr 1981).We have now begun work on restructuring another dictionaryavailable in MRF, the Garzanti Italian dictionary (1984).
Aparser has been implemented which, on the basis of thetypesetting codes for photocomposition, identifies the roughstructure of each lexical entry.

2 represents theprovisional model for a monolingual lexical entry as we havedefined it so far.

3 - Example of a parsed Entry.88The merging of part of the data of tile DM I and the Garzantidictionary into a single LI)B has already been completed, e.g.for lemmas, POSs, usage codes, etc.
We now have to tackle theproblcm of reorganizing the semantic data (dcfinitions andexamples).
Itcre our strategy is to design a new proceduralsystem which is ablc to gradually "learn" and acquire semanticinfornlation from dictionary definitions, going well bcyond thcIS-A hierarchies constructed so far, in order to attempt o alsocapturc what is prescnt in the "diffcrcntia" part of the definition.This can be achieved with some success given the particularnature of lexicographic definitions, with: a) a generic (andpe'rhaps over simplistic) description of the "world"; b) a ratherlcxically and syntactically constrained and a somewhat regularnatural anguage tcxt (Calzolari 1984, Wilks 1987).After having mappcd the codcs for photocomposition i tolinguistically relevant codes, all the preliminarily parsed data ofthe Garzanti have been organized on a PC in the form of aTextual Database (DBrl'), a fuEl-text Information Retrieval (IR)system in which all occurrences of any word-form or lermna canbe directly accessed (Picchi 1983).
The I)BT has been found tobe a very powerful tool in evidencing lexical units and particularsyntagms which can then be exploited in our "pattern-matching" procedure.
With the text in DBT form it is possibleto search occurrences of single word-forms in definitions andexamples, lemmas, codes of various types (POS, specializedlanguages, usage labels, etc.
), and also cooccurrences of any ofthese items throughout he entire dictionary.
In addition,structures composed of combinations of the above elementsconnected by the logical operators "and" and "or" to any degreeof complexity can also be searched.
The results of such queriesare returned together with the pertinent dictionary entries.Obviously frequencies can also be obtained.
All thisinformation can be retrieved with Fast interactive access.We have therefore already implemented two types oforganization for dictionary data:1) DB-type organization with the DM1 (we have not used astandard DBMS, but an ad hoc designed relational 1)B system);2) a full-text IR system for the Garzanti dictionary.Although both types of organization have proved to be verypowerful tools for different scopes, at tile same time eachpresents certain drawbacks and difficulties, due to the particularnature of dictionary data which in neither case has it beenpossible to fully exploit.
Dictionary data is in fact of a veryparticular nature, consisting of a combination of free text in ahighly organized structure.
The DB approach copes well withthe second characteristic, while the \[R approach is successful inhandling free text.
tlowever neither is capable of fullyexploiting the two features in combination.
A new methodmust be envisaged, capable of reorganizing free text intoelaborately structured information: this could be called theLexical Knowledge Base (LKB) approach, and is the aim of theproject described here.3.
Techniques fi~r word-sense acquisit ionDiscow:ry procedure techniques prove to be useful inextracting semantic information from definition texts.
Ingeneral, our approach consists in starting from fi'ee-tcxtdefinitions, in natural languagc linear form, analyzing andconverting them into inlormationally equivalent structuredtbrms.
The preliminary step of the work consisted in applyingthe morphological analyzer to the definitions; tim result of thisprocess tbr one definition appears in Fig.
4.
A programdesigned for homograph disambignation was then run on theotput produced by this morphological processor.
Thedisambiguator consists partly in rules generally valid for Italian,based on the immediate right and left context, and partly in adhoc rules written for the particular syntax used in lexicographicdefinitions.
Fig.
5 shows the result of applying thisdisambiguation procedure to all the homographs shown in thepreceding example.
We then had to implement a set ofdiscovery procedures acting on dictionary definitions.Entry ( EDITORE )Def ( che o chi stampa e pubblica l ib r i ,  periodicio musica, a scopo commereiale)F ( che )L (che, \['PR' ,\['NN'\] \], \['PT' ,\['NS'\] \],\[ 'DT' , \ [ 'NN' \ ]  \], \['DE' , \ [ 'NN' \ ]  \],\[ 'PI' ,\['MS'\] \], \['C ' , \[ '  '2 \] )F (o )L (o, \['SN' , \ [ 'NS ' \ ]  \],  \[ 'C ' , \ [ '  ' \ ]  \],\ [ ' I  ' , \ [ '  ' \]  \] )F ( chl )L (chi, \['PR' ,\['NS'\] \] )F ( stampa )L \[stampa, \['SF' ,\['FS'\] \] )L (stampare, \['VTP' ,\['S31P','S2MP'\]  )F (e )t (e, \['SN' ,\['NS'\] \], \['CC' , \ [ '  ' \]  \] )F ( pubblica )L (pubblico, \['A' ,\['FS '1 \] )L (pubblicare, \['VT' ,\['S31P','S2MP'\] )F ( l ibr i  )L (libro, \['SM' ,\['MP'\] \] )L (librare, \['VTR' ,\['S21P','SICP','S2CP','S3CP'\] \] )P \ [ , )F ( periodici )L (periodico, \['A ' ,\['MP'\] \], \['SM' ,\['MP'\] \] )F (o )L (o, \['SN' ,\['NS'\] \], \['C ' , \ [ '  '1 1,' l  ' , \ [ '  ' \]  \] )F ( musica )L (musica, \['SF' ,\['FS'\] \] )L (muslcare, \['VTI' ,\['S31P','S2NP'\] )I ' ( ,  )F(a)L (a, \ [ 'SN'  , \ [ 'NN ' \ ]  \ ] ,  \ [ 'E  ' , \ [ '  ' \ ]  \] )I- \[ scopo )L (scope, \[ 'SM' , \ [ 'MS ' \ ]  \] )L (scopare, \['VT' ,\[ 'SLIP'\] \] )F ( commereiale )L (eommerciale, \['A' ,\['NS '\] \] ).

4 - Output of the morphological analyzerThe first analysis of the definitional data was performedmanually for single definitimls, and quantitatively for the mostfrequently occurring words and syntagms.
From this analysiswe have established a number of broadly defined and simplifiedCategories of knowledge and Relations, which on the one handintuitively reflect basic "conceptual categories" and on the otherrepresenl attested lexicographic definitional categories.
Theyalso rely on past experience of similar work (both on Italian andon English), or of AI research.

As an example, the following lcmma~i:'arnese, attrczzo, dispositivo, strumcnto, congcgno', whichaltogether appear in dictionary definitions 761 dines, have beengrouped under the l.abel 'INSTR.UMI:~NT'.
Other examplesof I.abels behmging to the basic vocalmlary which ha~e beenestablished tbr hyl~ernyms are the following: SET, PART,SCII!N(II!, I l l ;MAN, ANIMAl.

We begin with a systemwhich has simple and general pnrpose pattern-matchingcapabilities, designing it as an incremental system.
To copewith the fact that there are ~ariations in the way the sameconceptual category or the same relation is linguistically(lcxically a ider  syntactically) rendered in natural languagedefinitions, each sttcll category or relation is associated with alist of specilicd lcxical units and or syntactic t'caturcs which givethe variant Ibrms.
The search is then driven by these lists ofpatterns to handle the grammatical nd lexical variations.The "pattcn>nmtching" strategy has bccn obviouslyintegrated with the Italian morphological analyzer to handleinflectional variation.
The patterns may contain either l.abcls,or Lemmas, or Word-tbrms.
For the Labels, the systemsearches for all the associated lcmmas and all their word-fornas(unless otherwise spccificd); in the same way l.emmas areautomatically expanded to cover their inllccted word-fo,'ms,Generally, wc look for recurring patterns in the definitionsand attempt o associate them with corresponding relations orconceptual categories.

Our practical global researchstrategy is to develop a system which at the beginning has onlya generalized expertise.
This system obviously breaks down atmany points on its first rtm; we can then evaluate all these90points, and consider when and where measures must be takento overcome specilic difficulties.
In this way, ncw capabilitiescan be added incrementally to the system so that gradually it isable to cope with increasingly difficult data.
Thus wcsystematically add new "knowledge" to the system, promptedeach time by a failure to cope with the given data.
It seems tous that this is a practical research strategy For cliciting andmodelling vague and fuzzy knowledge.liven though the methodological approach has beendeliberately simplified at the beginning (in order to introduceproblems gradually, a few at a time), the dimensions of the datahave not bccn limited in any way.4.
The knowledge organization.Although the body of knowledge with which we are dealingis at least partly based on intuition, on vague and not evencoherent data (as lexicographic definitions often are), and oninductive empirical strategies, we must attempt o model theknowledge as the system acquires it.
The formalism for therepresentation f word-senses i  as follows.Each element is defined as a Function characterized by aType and Arguments.
The Type qualifies the function.
Themain types include: tlypernym, Relation, Qualifier, etc.Examples of the Type.Relation are: USED, PRODU('I~D,IN-TIIIM:OP, M, SI'IJI)Y, LACK, etc.
The type l lypernymcan be instantiated by: !lyperriym proper, PART, SliT, etc.Arguments may be either Terms, or Terms plus Function, orFunctions.
A Term can be a Label, a Word, or a combinationof these with the logical operators 'and/or'.
A Word can beeither a Word-form, or a Lemma plus GrammaticalInformation (e.g.
INpl means plural Noun).The following definitions:Battcrio, s.m., microrganismo vcgetale unicellularc priw) diclorofilla.Batteriologia, s.f., parte della microbioloNa che studia i battcri.are now represented as:Batterio --def-- > f(T. t tYP,IN Imicrorganismo,f(T.QUAL,lAlvegetale, \]AlunicelMare),f(-I'.REL-I.,XCK,\[ N\[clorofilla))Baltcliolo~a --def-- > f(T.IIYI'-PART,f(T.REL-SPEC,lNImicrobiologia),f(T.I~,I-I ,-ST U D,I Nplbanerio) ) .As the metalanguage and the rules are declared separatelyfrom the pattern-matching parser, the system is incremental,flexible, portable (it can be used with other languages or otherdictionaries), and testable.
In fact, the system has beendesigned so that it is easy to test alternative strategies or setsof rules or constraints.This kind of organization will allow us to draw inferences,using part of the formal structure associated to an entry andinserting it in other structures in which that entry appears asan Argument.
For example, 'microbiologia' present in tilesecond definition above is dclined in its turn as 'parle dellabiologia the studia i microrganismi...', translated as(T.IIYI'-PAIUI',f(T.Rlil..SI'IiC,IN\[I~iologia)), and 'biologia'which is "scienza che studia i fenomeni della vita...' is finallydefined as T.1IYP-SCII!NCIL This last l.abcl SCIENCE isobviously also inherited by 'Battcriologia' and by..'Microbiologia',5.

This analysis o\[" the litst resuhs will leadto an improven~ent of the system, adding other patterns orother surface realizations of already existing patterns to the lirstsimple list of t)atterns, and also imposing constraints on givenhypernyms or on given relations.
I'heretbre, after the firststage, the system consists of patterns augmented withconditioning rules which will then drive subsequent runnings oftile procedure (\[br those cases which are lexically orgrammatically conditioned).
In this way, the system can begradually retined.
The analysis procedure is envisaged as aseries of cycles which lind relevant cooccurrenccs of categoriesand relations that can then be set as conditioning rules tofurther guide successive searches.
Art interactive phase is alsoforeseen so that, when necessary, definitions can be modified \[bra normalization i  accordance to acceptable analysis tructures.From succes!ive passes through the data, applying different andincreasingly <efined sets of patterns and rules, the procedurehuilds up, as completely as possible with this methodology, aformal description of the structure of the lexical definitions.At the end, from a comparison of the different formalizedstuctures generated, we will be able to associate structureswhich differ for only one element (a conceptual category orrelation).
In this way, we can construct something like"minimal pairs" of sense-definitions, which only differ in oneconceptual or relational feature.
It can be reasonably supposedthat this teature is related or realizes one of the differencesbetween these words.
It will also be possible to buildhierarchies not only for hypcrnyms, but also, and moreinterestingly, for complex conceptual structures considered as awhole.ReferencEsIt.
