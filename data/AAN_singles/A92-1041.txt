The hierarchical de~crip0.

For theRom/mian hnguage, there have been identified 136 inflectionalparadigtns.

:a) if a word ends in < inflexion > then247~dae root is what rernaim from the word after droppingthe < inflexion >~dae root belongs to the < inltectional-Lgaradig m >othe contextual-information c rresponding tothe currentword is ~'en by < slot-number >b) g a root belongs to the < inflectional-paradigm > andit is used in the context given by < slot -numlSer > thenothe word is obtained-by concatenating the given rootwith the < inflexion >.The lexicographer's interface is stric0y deoendent on theSofpeo-fim~ejCatiomfrom the linguist's interface sifice a'lar~e part of theormer is built automatically from the spedfications o-f tile latter.3 Lexical Stock BuildingMORPHO-2 lets the lexi.cog~apher d fine new entries in the lexi-con by means of a user-frien ..dly window oriented interface.Alexicon entry, has the foll6wing formal structure:< entry> ::= (< lemma >(< par a .digm,atic-description-selector >< inflexional-paradigni > ..< root > < morpho\].ogic-description >)  , , ,(<syntactic-des~ption> < senianfic-description> ) ) )The fields < lemma >, < _p,gradigmafi'c-deslaJption-selector >and < inflexional-paradigm > have 0ae obvious meaning.The field < root > may contain one or more roots~Insertingr .oots in the lexicon takes place in such a way that these shouldinherit the morphologicaI descriptions bel6nging to the slotswhere they occur.By < syntactic-description > ~ refer to restrictions on co-occurrence with other words .
(or phrases).
In order to slxcifysuch restrictions for the Roman~ ~ 6  we have perfor/nedsubeategorization f verbs based on their valency, objectcategories which .they govern(ea,~ a direct object may be an ac-cu~.a.
-tive noun without pre0osition, a reflexive pronoun or a non-finite form of a verb) and semantic features.The latter allow anoncontextual subcatego.rizati.on (f r exarn ple of nouns_) and acontexual one ~ sel~tional resfrictions (ih the case of ve.rbs).Typically, verb~ have a valency between 1 and 3 (th.
otighimp&sonaI verbs may have valen .cy 0).
The inlransitive verbs.areclaksified accor .ding to semantic criteria (verbs of motion~ state) orby their syntactic usa~ (like predicativi~ auxiliaries, urgpers6nalverbs with dative ).W'e should-notice that he same verb maybetransitiv 9 or intransitive, accor "ding to its m e.,~fin~; for example aajuq.

The actual semantic descriI~tious arestored in a separate data area, than the rest of the leficon, andthey are managed independently of MORPHO-2.A lexicon e21itor offers the lekicographer commands for delet-~g.
modifying alexicon entry and ~aen" listing according t 9 dif-ferent requests with respect to entry fields (Dtffnilxescu,1991).4 Morpho-Lexical ProcessingThe target natural l,~mguage processing system is the beneficiaryof the morpho-lexical processes execut~ byMORPHO-2.
_Word-forms ~ and synf.hesis are mediated b~ a proce.ss interlace.In the case of 1.~c~.. analysis, if the interface is giyen a se-quence_of words, it will return a sequence of morpho-lexicalatoms.

The former is oOained from en "dingand the latter from the lexicon en_tly corresponding toth~root.
The information for the other fields from the atom stru~ureis ~ taken from the lexicon entw_ correslx)nding, to the root.With respect to the result of morphoqogi _c91 congruence androot relxievfl within the lexico~ we may daTsfifv the moroho-lexi-cal atoms as unambiguous, am _b~ru_ous ~ind undetermined.The unambiguous morlaho-lexical toms assodate theanalyzed word with a single \[emma.
Inthe case of a root which.corr~po.nds to one lemma nd ~ more poss~.qgle morpholegi.caldescriflions, for the same para.digmatic description selector, thesystem will attempt to compact them.The ambiguous morpfio-lexical toms come from words towhich severaHemmae .may be attached.
The association of a rootwith several emmae is possible either due to ambiguity otcategory (e.g.
noun vs. verb) or to apparent homography,gene~at&1193/ theabsence of prosodic ma?rkers in the R0hmifi~nKangt~.
(m6dele, mod6le, ac61e, ficele, modfil, m6dtfl, etc.).
ThelX~O_~ iriterpretafions are ordered in such way that hose Whichcome from shorter roots (that means longer ending) have prio.rity.The undetermined morpho-lexical toms correspond towords which have no entry in the lexicon.
The atoms generated inthis situation have the foll6wing structure:(UNKNOWN < unknown-word>( < ixm~'ble-root > < morphologicMe.scri'pdon >'~*)The unknown word is associated with aql legal segmentationsand for each of them the morphological inf6i'rnation deducedfrom the identified en "dings i  prOcidex\[Lexical synthesis i the reverse of lexical analysk The processinterface nsures conversion of a morpho-lexical tom sefluenceinto a word _Sg:luence.
