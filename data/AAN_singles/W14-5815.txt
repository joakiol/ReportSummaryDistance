Manualevaluations of the partly automatically established synonym set (synset) relations between Dutchand English in Cornetto, a Dutch lexical-semantic database associated with the EuroWordNetgrid, have confronted us with a worrisome amount of erroneous links.
By extracting transla-tions from various bilingual resources and automatically assigning a confidence score to everypre-established link, we reduce the error rate of the existing equivalence relations between bothlanguages?
synsets (section 2).
We will apply this technique to reuse the connection of Scleraand Beta pictograph sets and Cornetto synsets to Princeton WordNet and other WordNets, allow-ing us to further extend an existing Dutch text-to-pictograph translation tool to other languages(section 3).1 IntroductionThe connections between WordNets, large semantic databases grouping lexical units into synonymsets or synsets, are an important resource in knowledge-based multilingual language processing.EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1997) aims to build language-specific WordNets among the same lines as theoriginal WordNet1(Miller et al., 1990), using Inter-Lingual-Indexes to weave a web of equivalence re-lations between the synsets contained within the databases.
Cornetto2(Vossen et al., 2007), a Dutchlexical-semantic collection of data associated with the Dutch EuroWordNet3, consists of more than 118000 synsets.
The equivalence relations establish connections between Dutch and English synsets inPrinceton WordNet version 1.5 and 2.0.
We update these links to Princeton WordNet version 3.0 by themappings among WordNet versions made available by TALP-UPC4.
The equivalence relations betweenCornetto and Princeton have been established semi-automatically by Vossen et al.
(1999).
Manual cod-ing was carried out for the 14 749 most important concepts in the database.
These include the mostfrequent concepts, the concepts having a large amount of semantic relations and the concepts occupyinga high position in the lexical hierarchy.
Automatic linkage was done by mapping the bilingual Van Daledatabase5to WordNet 1.5.
For every WordNet synset containing a dictionary?s translation for a particularDutch word, all its members were proposed as alternative translations.
In the case of only one transla-tion, the synset relation was instantly assumed correct, while multiple translations were weighted usingseveral heuristics, such as measuring the conceptual distance in the WordNet hierarchy.
We decided toverify the quality of these links and noticed that they were highly erroneous, making them not yet veryreliable for multilingual processing.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

A Cornetto synset is often linked to more than one Princetonsynset.
We found an erroneous link in 35.27% of the 998 equivalence relations we evaluated.Each Cornetto synset has about 3.3 automatically derived English equivalents, allowing to roughlycompare our evaluation to an initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen etal.
(1999).
They note that, in the case of synsets with three to nine translations, the percentages ofcorrect automatically derived equivalents went down to 65% and 49% for nouns and verbs respectively.Our manual evaluations are in line with these results, showing that only 64.73% of all the connectionsin our sample are correct.
An example of where it goes wrong is the Cornetto synset for the animal tor?beetle?, which is not only appropriately linked to correct synsets (such as beetle and bug), but alsomistakenly to the Princeton synset for the computational glitch.
This flaw is most probably caused bythe presence of the synonym bug, which is a commonly used word for errors in computer programs.Examples like these are omnipresent in our data6and led us to conclude that the synset links betweenCornetto and Princeton WordNet definitely could be improved.We build a bilingual dictionary for Dutch and English and use these translations as an automaticindicator of the quality of equivalence relations.
In order to create a huge list of translations we mergeseveral translation word lists, removing double entries.
Some are manually compiled dictionaries, whileothers are automatically derived word lists from parallel corpora: we extracted the 1-word phrases fromthe phrase tables built with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) based on the GIZA++ word alignments (Och andNey, 2003).
Table 1 gives an overview.This resulted in a coverage of 52.18% (43 970 out of 84 264) of the equivalence relations for whichtranslation information was available in order to possibly confirm the relation.Translation dictionary Reference Method of compilation Nr of word pairsWiktionary www.wiktionary.org Manual 23,575FreeDict www.freedict.com Manual 49,493Europarl (Koehn, 2005) Automatic 2,970,501Opus (Tiedemann, 2009) Automatic 6,223,539Sclera translations www.pictoselector.eu Manual 12,381Table 1: The used translation sourcesFigure 1 visualizes how we used the bilingual dictionaries to automatically evaluate the quality of thepre-established links between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet.
We retrieve all the lemmas of the lexicalunits that were contained within a synset Si(in our example, snoepgoed ?confectionary?
and snoep?candy?
extracted from S1).
Each of these lemmas is looked up in the bilingual dictionary, resultingin a dictionary words list of English translations.7This list is used to estimate the correctness of theequivalence relation between the Cornetto and the Princeton synset.We retrieve the lexical units list from the English synset Tj(in our example candy and confect extractedfrom T1).
We count the number of words in the lexical units list also appearing in the dictionary wordslist (the overlap being represented as the multiset Q).
Translations appearing more than once are givenmore importance.
For example, candy occurs twice, putting our overlap counter on 2.
This overlap isnormalized.
In the example it is divided by 3 (confect + candy + candy, as the double count is taken intoaccount), leaving us with a score of 66.67%.
For the gloss words list we remove the stop words8andmake an analogous calculation.
In our example, sweet is counted twice (the overlap being representedas the multiset R) and this number is divided by the total number of gloss words available (again taking6Other examples: nederig ?humble?
was linked to the synset for flexible (as a synonym for elastic), waterachtig ?aquatic?was linked to the synsets for grey and mousy, rocker (hardrocker) was linked to the synset for rocking chair, etc.7Note that this list can contain doubles (such as candy and delicacy), as these translations would provide additional evidenceto our scoring algorithm.
It is therefore not the case that the dictionary words list represents a set.
It represents a multiset.8http://norm.al/2009/04/14/list-of-english-stop-words121Figure 1: The scoring mechanism with examplesinto account the double count).
Averaging this score of 25% with our first result, we obtain a confidencescore of 45.83% for this equivalence relation.
We calculated this confidence score for every equivalencerelation in Cornetto.We checked whether the automatic scoring algorithm (section 2) (dis)agreed with the manual judge-ments in order to determine a satisfactory threshold value for the acceptance of synset links.
Evaluationresults are shown in figure 2.
While the precision (the proportion of accurate links that the system gotright) went slightly up as our criterium for link acceptance became stricter, the recall (the proportion ofcorrect links that the system retrieved) quickly made a rather deep dive.
The F-score reveals that the besttrade-off is reached when synset links getting a score of 0% are rejected, retaining any link with a higherconfidence score.
The results in Table 3 shows that we were able to reduce the error rate to 21.09%,which is a relative improvement of 40.20% over the baseline.3 Improving the equivalence relations in the context of text-to-pictograph translationBeing able to use the currently available technological tools is becoming an increasingly important factorin today?s society.
Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to the whole of commu-nication methods which aim to assist people that are suffering from cognitive disabilities, helping them tobecome more socially active in various domains of daily life.
Text-to-pictograph translation is a particularform of AAC technology that enables linguistically-impaired people to use the Internet independently.Filtering away erroneous synset links in Cornetto has proven to be a useful way to improve the qualityof a text-to-pictograph translation tool.
Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) have connected pictographsets to Cornetto synsets to enable text-to-pictograph translation.
Equivalence relations are important toallow reusing these connections in order to link pictographs to synsets for other languages than Dutch.122Figure 2: Precision (top line), recall (bottom line) and F-score (middle line) for different threshold valuesof link acceptance.Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) released Sclera2Cornetto, a resource linking Sclera9pictographsto Cornetto synsets.
Currently, over 13 000 Sclera pictographs are made available online, 5 710 of whichhave been manually linked to Cornetto synsets.
We want to build a text-to-pictograph conversion withEnglish and Spanish as source languages, reusing the Sclera2Cornetto data.By improving Cornetto?s pre-established equivalence relations with Princeton synsets, we can connectthe Sclera pictographs with Princeton WordNet for English.
The latter, in turn, will then be used as theintermediate step in our process of assigning pictographs to Spanish synsets.Manual evaluations were made for a randomly generated subset of the synsets that were previouslyused by Vandeghinste and Schuurman (2014) for assigning Sclera and Beta10pictographs to Cornetto.Beta pictographs are another pictograph set for which a link between the pictographs and Cornetto wasprovided by Vandeghinste (2014).Table 2 presents the coverage of our bilingual dictionary for synsets being connected to Sclera andBeta pictographs, which is clearly higher than the coverage over all synsets.Covered Total Difference with All synsetsAll synsets 43 970 (52.18%) 84 264 -Sclera baseline 5 294 (88.80%) 5 962 36.62%Beta synsets 3 409 (88.94%) 3 833 36.76%Table 2: Dictionary Coverage for different sets of synsetsTable 3 shows that the error rate of Cornetto?s equivalence relations on the Sclera and Beta subsetsis much lower than the error rate on the whole set (section 2).
We attribute this difference to the factthat Vossen et al.
(1999) carried out manual coding for the most important concepts in the database (seesection 1), as the Sclera and Beta pictographs tend to belong to this category.
In these cases, everysynset has between one and two automatically derived English equivalents on the average, allowing usto roughly compare with the initial quality check of the equivalence relations performed by Vossen et al.
(1999) showing that, in the event of a Dutch synset having only one English equivalent, 86% of the nounsand 78% of the verbs were correctly linked, while the ones having two equivalents were appropriate in68% and 71% of the cases respectively.The F-score in Figure 3 reveals that the best trade-off between precision and recall is reached at the> 0% threshold value, improving the baseline precision for both Sclera and Beta.
We now retrieve allEnglish synsets for which a non-zero score was obtained in order to assign Sclera and Beta pictographsto Princeton WordNet.9http://www.sclera.be10http://www.betavzw.be123Figure 3: Precision (top line), recall (bottom line) and F-score (middle line) for Sclera and Beta synsetsrespectively, for different threshold values of link acceptance.Baseline Current Relative improvementAll 35.27% 21.09% 40.20%Sclera 14.50% 9.95% 31.38%Beta 15.77% 13.47% 14.58%Table 3: The reduction in error rates of Cornetto?s equivalence relations.4 Related workUsing bilingual dictionaries to initiate or improve WordNet linkage has been applied elsewhere.
LinkingChinese lemmata to English synsets (Huang et al., 2003) to create the Chinese WordNet is one suchexample.
The 200 most frequent Chinese words and the 10 most frequent adjectives were taken asa starting set and found as translation equivalences for 496 English lemmata, making each Chineselemma corresponding to 2.13 English synsets on average.
Evaluations showed that 77% of the 496equivalent pairs were synonymous.
This accuracy rate dropped to 62.7% when the list of equivalencepairs was extended by including all WordNet synonyms.
Sornlertlamvanich et al.
(2008) assign synsetsto bilingual dictionaries for Asian languages by considering English equivalents and lexical synonyms,listing all English translations and scoring synsets according to the amount of matching translationsfound, yielding an average accuracy rate of 49.4% for synset assignment to a Thai-English dictionaryand an accuracy rate of 93.3% for synsets that are attributed the highest confidence score.
Joshi etal.
(2012) generate candidate synsets in English, starting with synsets in Hindi.
For each Hindi synset, abag of words is obtained by parsing its gloss, examples and synonyms.
Using a bilingual dictionary, theseHindi words are translated to English.
Various heuristics are used to calculate the intersection betweenthe translated bag of words and the synset words, concepts or relations of the target language, such asfinding the closest hyperonym synset (accuracy rate of 79.76%), the closest common synset word bag(accuracy rate of 74.48%) and the closest common concept word bag (accuracy rate of 55.20%).
Finally,Soria et al.
(2009) develop a mechanism for enriching monolingual lexicons with new semantic relationsby relying on the use of Inter-Lingual-Indexes to link WordNets of different languages.
However, thequality of these links is not evaluated.5 Conclusions and future workWe have shown that a rather large reduction in error rates (a relative improvement of 40.20% on thewhole set) concerning the equivalence relations between Cornetto and Princeton WordNet can be ac-quired by applying a scoring algorithm based on bilingual dictionaries.
The method can be used to createnew equivalence relations as well.
Contrasting our results with related work shows that we reach at leastthe same level of correctness, although results are hard to compare because of conceptual differencesbetween languages.
An accuracy rate of 78.91% was obtained for the general set of Cornetto?s equiva-lence relations, while its subset of Sclera and Beta synsets (denoting frequent concepts) acquired final124precision rates of 90.05% and 86.53% respectively (compare with section 4).One advantage of our method is that it could easily be reused to automatically build reliable linksbetween Princeton WordNet and brand-new WordNets.
Unsupervised clustering methods can provide uswith synonym sets in the source language, after which the bilingual dictionary technique and the scoringalgorithm can be applied in order to provide us with satisfactory equivalence relations between bothlanguages.
Semantic relations between synsets can then also be transferred from Princeton to the sourcelanguage?s WordNet.Our improved links will be integrated in the next version of Cornetto.
Future work will consist ofscaling to other languages through other relations between WordNets.6 AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Tom Vanallemeersch for providing us with the EuroParl and Opus alignmenttables.
