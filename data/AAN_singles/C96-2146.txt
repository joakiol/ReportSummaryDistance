jpAbstractThis paper describes a mefllod for ~malyzingJapanese double-subject constniction having anadjective predicate based on the valencystructure.
A simple sentence usually has onlyone subjective case in most languages.However, lnmly Japancse adjeclivcs (and someverbs) can dominate two surface subjectivecases within a simple sentence.
Such sentencestructure is called lhe double-subjectconstruction.
This paper classifies lhe Japtulesedouble-subject constntction i lo four types middescribes problems arising when analyzingfllcse lypes using orditmry Japmlese constructionapproaches.
This paper proposes a method tbranalyzing a Japanese double-subjectconstruction having an adjective predicate inorder to overcome lhe problems described.
Byapplying tiffs melhod to Jap~mese senlence,'malysis in Japanese-to-English machine~,mslalion systems, tl'm~slalion accuracy can beimproved because tiffs melhod eml analyzecorreclly the double-subject construction.1 IntroductionWe have bccn developing a Japanese-to-Englishmadfine lrauslation syslem called ALT-J/E (lkehm-aet al, 1987).
In ALT-J/E, Japanese sentence analysisis performed based on lhe wdency slruclure for thepredicalc of the input sentence.
ALT-J/E c~m trm~slateseveral special Japm~ese constntclions such as predicateidioms and funclion verb expressions (Oku, 1992).The Jap~mese double-subject conslntclion was nolhandled well by the original ALT-J/E.
This paperdescribes a melhod lbr mmlyzing a Japanese double-subject construction having an ad.i eclivet)rcdicate bascdon Ihe valency structure.Simple sentences normally have only one sub.icctivccase in most languages.
However, it is possible formany Japlmese adjectives (and so me verbs) to dominatetwo surface subjective cases within a simple sentence.Such sentence structure is called lhe double-subjectconstruction.
JEiDA (Ihe Japan Elcclronic IndustryDevelopment Associalion) has issued evaluationst~mdards for machine lnmslation systems (JEIDA,1995).
~Ihe main aim of lhese standards i to establishobjective test sets for machine translation systemevaluation.
Therefore, they include ahnost of alllinguislic phenomena flu,l the systems have to process.In lhc slandards, the double-subject eonslruclion islisted as one of the conslruclions lhat arc difficult loprocess uccessfidly.Many Japmlesephilologistshavesludicdthc double-subject construction because it is necessary to revealthe synlaclic or scmmltic structure of lhis constructionif wc are to establish a syntactic or sem~ullic lheo~,lor the Japanese language (lshigami, 1977) (Kuno,1973) (Mikami, 1961)).
However, there arc a few sludiesfor processing this conslmction from lhe point of viewof computational linguislics or engineering (Mttrala,1990).
~llmrelbrc, lhc aim of lhis paper is to discuss amelhod for ;malyzing lhc Japanese double-subjectconstnlction havhlg an adjective predicate from lhepoint of view of engineering.2 Definit ion of key termsKey terms used in this paper me defined as follows:?
case-marldng particleIn English, each case is marked by its relative posilionin terms of tile predicate or by a preposition.
In contrastto lhis, Japanese language marks each case by a certainsort of postposilional parlicle located next to nounphvases udl as "ga" or "we".
Such particles arc callcd"case-markiu g pm-ticl es".?
adverbial particle"Adverbial particles" give a case an additional function(topicalizalion etc.)
by their allachmenl to Ibc casc-markingparlicle.
Some adverbial particles uch as "wa"or "me" often stand-in for case-marking parlicles andgive the case ;m additional fimclion.?
sentence having an adjective predicateIn the Japanese I~mguage, adjectives function aspredicates in sentences as do verbs, qlmrefore, in thispaper, lhe sentence in which m~ adjective acts as apredicate is called a "senlence having an Mieclivepredicate".. double-sul;jeet constructionUsually, a simple sentence has only one subjeclivccase.
ttowevcr, m~my Japanese adjeclives (and some865verbs) can dominate two surface subjective cases withina simple sentence.
Such sentence structure is calledtile "double-subject onstrnction".
This constn~ctionincludes both adverbial particle "wa" and subjectivecase-marking p~trticle "ga".
Therefore, the Japanesedouble-subject onstruction is also referred to as file"wa"-"ga" construction.?
valency structureThe sentence structure can be considered as acombination of a predicate and its modifiers.
Suchsentence stntcturc is called the "valency structure".The valency structure represents what surface casesthe modifiers dominated by a given predicatecorrespond to.?
valency pattern"Valency patterns" are stnlcture patterns that formulatepossible valency structures for predicates.
A valencypattern is defined for each usage for each predicate.Figure 1 shows an example of a valency pattern for averb "shoukai sunl (introduce)".
For vcrbs andadjectives, wdcncy patterns formulated as shown infigure 1 are collect ed beforehand in the dictionary calledthe valency pattern dictionary.Japanese valency pattern tbr "~,~ 9'\]" J -~"N1 \] SR: \[(agent)\](suljective) \] JR: 73";, h "~ JN2 \] SR: \[(agent)\]N3 | SR: \[(agent)l(objective2)\] JR: ~Remarks:Ni: Label for a valency elementSR: Semantic restriction on a nounJR: Restriction on case-marking particlesFigure 1.
An example of a valency pattern.?
valency elementIn the valency stn~cture, each relation between apredicate and its modifier is called a "valency element".As shown in figure I, valency elements are describedusing both the semantic restriction on the noun includingthe modifier and the restriction on the case-markingpmaicles including the modifier.?
sentence analysis (or analyzing a sentence)"Sentence analysis" is the process that reveals thevalency structure of the input sentence.
ALT-J/Eperfonns entence analysis by binding the modifiersfor the predicate in the input sentence to the valencyelements in the wtiency pattern for the predicate in thewdency pattern dictionary.?
semantic ategoryA "semantic ategory" is a class for dividing nounsinto concepts according to their meaning.
For example,both "man" and "woman" belong to the same semanticcategory \[(human)\].
In the below, the words surroundedby 1( )\] are semantic categories.3 Japanese Sentence Analysis based onthe valency structureFigure 2 outlines the translation process in ALT-J/E(Hayashi, 1987).
Morphological nalysis egments heinput Japanese sentence into its component words suchas predicates and nouns.
Dependency analysisdetermines the dependency structure to indicate theassociation between words.
From the associationbetween a predicate and its modifiers in the dependencystructure, sentence analysis tries to determine thewflency strncture, i.e., it determines, for the valencypattern for the predicate, which valency element ead~modifier corresponds to.
This valency stnlcture is thenconverted into the equivalent English sentencestructure.
Finally, the outpnt English sentence isgenerated from the stnlcture.Input Japanese ntence\[Moq~hological ana lys is \ ]~- \ ]apanese  dict ional"~y~Dictionary about \[ \[Dependency analysis j .

Outline of translation process in ALT-J/E,The following describes how ordintu'y sentencesare analyzed by ALT-J/E using the valency structurefor the predicate of file input sentence.Sentence analysis is the process that converts thedependency structure into file valency structure byreferring to wdency patterns.
All valency patterns foreach usage with each predicate are prepared beforehandand held in the valency pattern dictionary.. As shownin figure 1, for each predicate, both file semanticrestriction on a noun including its modifier and filerestrictions on case-marking particles including itsmodifier are described for each valency element.
Whenthe modifier in the input sentence satisfies bothrestrictions for a certain wllency element in the valencypattern for the predicate, the modifier is botmd to thatvalency element.
The valency smlctnre is determinedby binding all predicate modifiers to valency elements.An adverbial particle can correspond to more than onecase-marking pataicle, for example, "wa" is a possibleproxy for "ga", "wo", "hi" and so on.
Therefore, sentenceanalysis first tries to bind modifiers that have case-marking particles, each of which represents which caseis unambiguously marked by particle spelling like "ga"866Japanese input sentence: ~Lt:kg.L~L'~L:/)))~;~{7'~ b-l-<o (he introduced his sister to me)?

Thc analysis thcntries to bind modifiers that have ml adverbial particleto the non-bolmd valency elements.Figure 3 shows an example of this type of Japanesesentence mmlysis for the sentcncc "kare wa watashini kate no imouto we shoukai shita (he theeduced hissister to me)".
First, the mmlysis tries to bind modifierswith case-tam'king parlicles "we" and "ni" to tile wdencyelements in the wdency pattern for the predicate"shoukai sent (introduce)" which is oblaincd IYom lhcvalency pattem dictionary.
As modifiers satisfy bolhrestrictions on the noun memfing and case-markingparlicles, they ,are bound to N2 (objective case 1) midN3 (objective case 2), respectively.
The ~malysis thenlfies to bind lhe modifier with adverbial particle "wa"to a non-bound valency element.
So far, N2 and N3in the wflcncy paltem have already been bound.Therefore, as shown in figure 3, the only non-boundvalency element is N1 which is a subjective case.
Theadverbial particle "wa" c~m stand-in for case-markingp~wticlc "ga", which is the non-bound wfiency clcment,mid the noun "km-e (he)" satisfies the scmanticrestriction on the subjcctive case N1 i.e.
\[(agent)\].Therefore, file modifier with "wa" is bonnd to timsubjective case N1.
Finally, lhc valency structure asshown in figure 3 is obtained.4 Processing the Japanese double-subjectconstructionMany Japmmse adjective predicates domhmtc twosubjective cases and so form the double-subjectconstruction.
The double-subject onstmctiou havingan Miective predicate actually has several wlrimlts, sono one approach c,'m be uscd to mlalyze it.
Accordingly,this section classifies the four types mid thecharacteristics of eadl type ~'e described.4.1 Classification of the Japanese dnuble-subjcetconstructionTile Japanese doublc-subjcct onsmlction (also calicOthe "wa"-"ga" conslruction) can be classified into lhefollowing four types based on a previous study(lshigami, 1977):?
type-IIn this vafi~mt, adverbial particle "wa" is a proxy for acase-marking particle such as "ni" other than subjectivecase-ram-king "ga".
Example-1 shows "wa" as a proxyfor case-marking particle "hi" in tile sentence "wamshino ie wa gakkou ga chikai (file school is near myhouse)" .Example- 1(myhouse) (adverbial (school) (case-marking (nea 0pro'title "wa") particle "ga")~1?
"wa" is \[br "ni".
proxy(myhousc) (destination (school) (subjective (hem') case-marking case-marking particle "ni") pmticle "ga")?
type-2in this wu'iant, adverbial parlicle "wa" is a proxy forcase-umrking panicle "no" representing a nounmodifier (pre-nominal).
Example-2 shows "wa" as aproxy for pre-nominal case-marking p~ulicle "no" inthe sentence "zou wa ham ga nagai (elcplumls havelong trunks)".
In this wu-itmI, the case of"wa" modifyinga predicate must be analyzed as "no" modifying the867Japanese input sentence: 7~7~h~~: t, ~o (elephants have long trunks) Japanese valency pattern for "~ 1~ v,dependency structure ~ (subjective) JR: 7~/ F@ @ ~  Ni: Label ~br a valency elementrefer to valency pattern SR: Semantic restriction on a nounon case-marking pazticles.'

"wa" is proxy for "no".
(elephant) (pre-nominal (nose) (subjective (long)case-marking case-markingparticle "no") particle "ga")?
type-3In this variant, the case with case-marking particle"ga" sometimes represents ~m objective case.
Allhoughan objective case is usually marked by case-markingparticle "wo", some adjective predicates have anoNective case marked by case-marking particle "ga".Example-3 shows that "kanojo (she)" with "ga" is anobjective case and "kare (he)" with "wa" is a subjectivecase in the sentence "kare wa kanojo ga snkida (helikes her)".
As case-marking particle "ga" normallyindicates the subjective case, binding "ga" to thesubjective case leads to incorrect mmlysis if onlysurface spelling is considered.Examlfle-3(he) (adveNial (her) (case-marking (like)particle "wa") particle "ga")?

"r~roxytor ~a.
|  g ,P .. Pwa" lS ~ ~ ~V all oDjecuve case~ (subjective (her) (objective (like)(he) case-marking case-markingparticle "ga") particle "wo")?
type-4In this variant, the case with adverbial particle "wa"acts as all adverbial phrase representing time and isactually a special form of type-1.
Representing time isoptional for most predicates.
Moreover, Japm~ese timeexpressions are often translated into English adverbialphi'ases.
Therefore, type-4 is separated from type-1 inthis classification from viewpoint of enghmering.Example-4 shows that time expression "6-gatsu wa(in Jmle)" acts as an adverbial phrase in the sentence"6-gatsu wa ame ga tot (it has much rain in June)".Example-4(June) (adverbial (rain) (case-marking (ninth)~(t particle "wa") particlc "ga")ime expression with "wa" acts as an adverbial phrase(June) (rain) (subject ive (much)(adverbial case-markingphrase) particle "ga")4.2 Problems in processing the Japanese double-subject constructionType-I and type-4 cases can be analyzed using theprocessing flow described in section 3 becauseadverbial particle "wa" simply acts as a case-markingparticle.
However, the following problems ,arise whenprocessing type-2 and type-3 cases in the normal way.?
Problem with type-2 casesFignre 4 shows the m~alysis of the type-2 example,"zou wa hana ga nagai (elephanls have long thinks)".The predicate "nagai (long)" has only one valencyelement N1 with "ga".
According to ordinary sentenceanalysis, the modifier "hana ga" is bound to the valencyelement NI, which means that the other modifier "zouwa" is left unbound.
That is, sentence analysis camlotbe completed as shown in the left bottom of figure 4.This complicates the accurate Wanslation of thismodifier into English.868Japanese input sentence: ~:1:~/& '~O~ '57o (he likes her)1?

ProMem with type-3 casesFigure 5 shows the analysis of sentence analysis ofthe type-3 example, "kare wa k~mqio ga sukida (helikes her)".
If modifiers with a case-marking parlicleare preferentially processed as described in seclion 3,then the modifier with "ga" binds to subjective caseN1 which is wrong in this example.
This leads us lolhe wrong interpretation as shown in lhe left bottomof figure 5.5 Proposed method for analyzing Japanesedouble-subject constructionIn order to overcome lhe problems described in theprevious section, this section proposes a method foranalyzing a Japanese double-subject conslmctionhaving m~ adjective predicate.
The mefl~od has fllrecprocessing phases.
The first determines whether lhcinput sentence has double-subject construction ornot.The second etermines which of tim four wtri~mls filesentcnce is.

Processing flow for analyzinga Japanese douMe-suhjeet construction.well as sentences with verb predicates, are processednormally as described ill section 3.?
Type determinationFirst, lype-4 is set if the modifier with adverbial parlicle"wa" represents a time expression or not.
Tiffs isefficient because type-4 is the most specific type.
Thisjudgment is performed by checking whether thesemantic calegory of the noun included in the modifierwith "wa" is associated with \[(time)\] or not.
Second,type-3 is set by the valency paltem for the predicate inlh?
input.
The predicate in a type-3 case has to cover869both subjective and objective cases in its usage.
Thevalency pattern for each usage for each predicate isdefined in the valency pattern dictionary.
Therefore,this judgment is performed by checking whether thevalency pattern for the predicate includes both asubjcctive case and an objective case.
Finally, type-1and type-2 are differentiated according to the result ofbinding betwccn the modifiers in the input senteuceand thevalency elements inthe valency pattern.
Type-2is set ff the modifier with case-marking particle "ga"is bound to the subjective case and the modifier withadverbi~d particle "wa" is not.
The remaining casesare judged as type-1.
Here, modifiers with "wa" and"ga" ,are often bound in type-1.
Notice that the bindingprocess resolves what case-marking parlicle theadverbial particle "wa" stands-in for.?
Determining the valency structureIn the type-4 preprocessing step in figure 6, the modifierwith "wa" (time reference) is considered as an adverbialplwase.
Next, binding the other modifiers with thevalency elements inthe valency pattern for the prcdicateis attcmpted.
This facilitates the translation of Japanesetime expressions into English.In the type-3 prcprocessing step in figure 6, case-marking particle "ga" has to be converted into thecase-marking particle "wo" before binding the formerwhich represents an objective case.
This conversionallows us to correctly bind each modifier to itsappropriate valency element, becanse predicates intype-3 cases have both a subjective case with "ga" andan objective case with "wo".
See the example in theright bottom of fignre 5.In type-2 processing, adverbial particle "wa" is aproxy for pre-nominal case-marking particle "no" andthe modifier with adverbial particle "wa" must beanalyzed as the phrase which modifies the snbjectivecase with "ga".
As a result, type-2 mmlysis involveschanging the valency structure.
In figure 4, the nounphrase "zou no hana" is fornled from both "zou(elcphant)" with "wa" and "hzma 0lose)" with "ga" byconverting "wa" into "no", and "zou no hana" is boundto the subjective case for the predicate "nagai (long)".See the example in the right bottom of figure 4.Moreover, type-2 processing tries to determine thesemantic relation between the noun with "ga" and thenoun with "no" (originally "wa").
Determining thesemmltic relation helps us translate he Japanese double-subject construction into the appropriate Englishconstruction a d expression.
Although several semanticrelations are known, at the present time ALT-J/E canresolve only two of them based on semantic categories:has-a relation and is-a relation.As adverbial particle "wa" in type-I cases is aproxy for a case-marking particle such as "ni", "de"and so on, type-I cases can be processed in the waydescribed in section 3.The above approach con'ectly determines die inputsentence's valency structure which allows the maddnetranslation system to produce more accurate output.As a result, the method proposed here improves thetranslation accuracy of ALT-J/E.6 Conc lus ionThis paper has proposed a method for analyzing theJapanese double-subject onstruction that includes anadjective predicate.
This paper has classified theconstruction i to four .types and described problemswhen applying the ordinary sentence analysis to thefour types.
The algorithm that overcomes theseproblems has been explained in detail.This method has been applied to Japanese sentenceanalysis in ALT-J/E.
Because this method cau correctlyanalyze the double-subject onstruction, the methodhelps the translation of this constrnction into anappropriate English construction.References:Yoshihiko Hayashi, "On the Japanese sentencesmlalysis based on the valency structure", Workinggroup report on natural anguage proces.s'ing, II'SJapan, 62-6 (1987) (in Japanese).Satoru lkehara, Masahiro Miyazaki, Satoshi Shirai andYoshihiko Hayashi, "Speaker's recognition andmulti-level-translating method based on it", Trans.IPS Japan, Vol.28, No.12, pp.1269-1279 (1987)(in Jap~ese).Terno lshigami, "Structure of Japm~ese double-subjectconstruction with adjective predicates (nijml-stmkaku keiyoushi bun no kouzot0 ", 1,;ssay onJapanese philology (nihongo-gaku shiron) , Vol.3,pp.
