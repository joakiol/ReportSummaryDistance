INTEX: A CORPUS PROCI!\]SSIN(-?, SYSTEMMax I).
SilberzteinLaboratoirc d'Automatiquc 1)ocumentaire ct LinguistiqueUniversil6 Paris 7ABSTRACTINTEX is a text processor; it is usually used toparse corpora of several megabytes.
It includesseveral built-in large coverage dictionaries andgrammars represented by graphs; the user inayadd his/her own dictionaries and gramnlars.These tools am applied to texts in order to locatelexical and syntactic patterns, remove ambigu-ities, and tag words.
INTEX builds collcordancesand indexes of all types of patterns; it is used bylinguists to analyse corpora, but can also beviewed as an information feb'lewd system.INTROI)UCTIONINTEX automatically identities words and mor-pho-syntactic patterns in large texts.
By usingINTEX, one can:.... build the dictionary of lhe words of the texts;words may be simple words (sequences of letters,e.g.
table), compounds (sequences of simplewords which include a separator, e.g.
worU pro~cessor) or complete expressions (sequences ofwords which accept insertions, e.g.
to kick ... thebucket);--- locate in texts all occurrences of a given word(even if inflected), a given category (e.g.
all femi-nine plural adjectives) or a morpho-syniactic pat~tern (a regular expression);- -app ly  grammars represented by recursivegraphs to texts; build indexes or concordances forall occurrences of the previous patterns;.... use local grammars to remove word and uller-ance ambiguities in texts, or to detect errors ordeviant sequences.While INTEX already i,lcludes several built-indictionaries and granunars, it allows tile user tocreate, c(lit and add his/her own tools, hi order toincrease coverage of texts and to remove addi-tional ambiguilies.1.

F in i te  S ta te  T ransducersFSTs are represented in INTEX by recursivegraphs.
Basically, the "input" part of an FST isused to identify patterns in texts; the "output"part of an FST is used to associate ach identifiedoccurrence with information.
In many cases,FSTs represent words more naturally than dictio-naries.
For example, numerical determiners, uchas trente-cinq mille neuf cents trente-qttatre, for-really are compounds which are naturally repre-sented by graphs (see the graph Dmlm inAppendix 1).
FSTs may also be used to bringtogether graphical variants of a woM in order tocheck the spelling coherency, to associate all thevariants of a term with a unique canonical ent,'yin an index, to represent families of derivedwords (see the graph France in Appendix 1), toassociate synonyms of a term in an informationretrieval system, etc.
In the graph editor, graynodes are graph names; tags written in whitenodes are the inputs of the FSTs, outputs are writ-ten below nodes 4.
The user draws graphs directly3.
For a discussion on the completeness of the DELACF, see in\[Courtois; Silberztein 1989\].4.
For a description f the graph editor of INTEX, see \[Silberztein1993\].on the screen; the resulting raphs a're interpretedas FSTs by INTEX.By selecting and applying dictionaries and FSTsto a text, the user builds the dictionary of thewords of the text.
Appendix 1 shows the resultingdictionary, as well as the list of all unknowntokens.
Generally, these tokens are either spellingerrors or proper names.2.
LOCATING PATTERNSAfter having built the dictionary of the words ofthe text, the user can locate morpho-syntaetic pat-terns in the corpus, index o1' build a concordancefor all occurrences of the pattern.
Patterns maybe:- -a  word, or a list of words.
For example, onecan locate in a text all occurrences of the verbfaire (even when inllected), all the compoundnouns (since most of them are non-ambiguousterms, their list constitutes a good index);- -a  given category, such as verb conjugated inthe third person sitzgttlar (V:3s), or noun in thefeminine plural (N:fp), etc.
Here arc severalexamples of categories5:A:p (adjective in plural), ADV (adverb),DE7".
'f (femirzine determirzer),DKms (past participle, mascttline singu-lar), etc.- -a  syntactic pattern represented by a regularexpression or a graph; the following is a regularexpression:<t?tre> (<ADV> + <E>) <DET> <N>This pattern re'Itches any sequence beginningwith a conjugated form of the verb e?tp'e, option-ally followed by an adverb (<E> stands for thenull word), followed by a determiner and then anoun.
Note that categories match simple andcompound words.
In particular; <ADV> alsomatches compound adverbs.
More generally, theuse," may apply to the text grammars expressedby recursive graphs; graphs typically represent:- -  sees of synonymous expressions, uch as : per-dre Ia t~te, l'esprit, le nord, etc.
Graphs in differ-5.
For a syntactic description f the categories, see \[Silberztein19931.580ent languages can be linked, so that eachmatching sequence in the source language couldbe automatically associated with the correspond-ing graph in the target hmguage (e.g.
lose one'shead, mind, bearings, etc.).
A graph may repre-sent all the expressions which designate an entity,or a process; indexing such graphs allows one toretrieve information in large corpora;- -  pieces of a large-coverage rammar of the lan-guage.
Recnrsive graphs are easily edited; stan-dard operations on graphs (union, intersection,differences, etc.)
help to build an easily main-rained system of hundreds of elementary graphs.This construction has begun in LADL; wealready have graphs describing adverbial comple-ments which express a measure (temperature,speed, length, etc.
), a time or a date (e.g.
le 17fdvrier 1993, le premier hmdi du mois de jnin)(Maurel 1989), some locative structures (Garri-gues 1993), etc.3.
REMOVING AMBIGUITIESIn order to disambiguate words in texts, INTEXuses cache dictionaries and local grammars.3.1 .
Cache dictionariesSince the DELAF and DELACF dictionariesincluded in INTEX have a very large coverage,they contain a number of words which only occurin some specific domains; in addition, some fie-quent words may be associated with generallyinappropriate information.
For instance, par isusually a preposition in French, but in some casesit may be a noun (a technical term in gol\[).
Bydefault, each occurrence of this token will be con-sidered ambiguous (preposition or noun).
Cachedictionaries are used as filters: if INTEX finds aword in a cache dictionary, it will not look tip theselected ictionaries and FSTs.
If the user knowsthat in a given corpus, the token par is always aproposition, he/she enters the following entry in acache dictionary:pat; par.
PREPHence, the user can avoid unnecessary ambigu-ities by putting frequent words (or conversely,specific terms) in cache dictionarids adapted toeach processed text.Most compounds are ambiguous, since they for-really are sequences of simple words; forinstance, the sequence pomme de terre is not nec-essarily a compound noun in the following sen-tence :Luc recottvre une pomme de terre tulle(Luc covetw a cooked potato)(Luc covers an apple with scorched earth)However, a number of compounds are not ambig-uous, either because they contain a non-autono-mous conslituent (e.g.
aujourd'hui), or becausethey are technical terms (e.g.
tm lube cathodiqtte,un sous-marin ucldaire).
By entering these non-ambiguous compounds in a cache dictionary, theuser prevents INTEX fi'om looking up dictionar-ies and FSTs for simple words; hence INTEXdoes not process these conlpounds as ambiguous.3.2.
Local grammarsA local granmaar is a two-part rule: if a givensequence of words is matched, then each word inthe sequence is tagged in the proper way.
Forinstance, in the sequence s'en donne, s' is a 1)1"o-noun (not a conjunction), en is a pronoun (not apreposition), and donne is a verb (not a noun).The corresponding local grammar would be:s '/<PRO> en/<PRO> <MOT>/< V><MOT> stands for any word.
Local grammars arcrepresented by FSTs, heuce their length and theirCOml)lcxity have no limit.
Any number of localgiammars may be used at lho sanie (line to disanl~bigualo Ioxls (FSTs Inorgo easily); hence it is bestIo el'tale small ()lieS.
Local ~l'aillnlal's use lhc dic-tionary of the words of the texts, so they correctlyhaildle sequellCOS with coinpounds.
Appendix 2shows a few local grannllars.
IN'rEX inchidos adozen "pcrfccl" local granllliars, tllat is, gram-ilqars that will never give hlcorreot lagging sohi-tioils; the user may add his/her own perfect (orprobabilistic) disan~bigualing gralnnlars.3.3.
The resiill of lhe parshigAfter having selected linguistic tools (either dic-tionaries or FSTs), the riser cau parse tile text,that is, insert in the text all the linguistic informa-tion reqt, ired by a syntactic parser.
For instance,the text: iI la donne would at this step be repre-sented by the following expression:iI, PRO(la, PRO:fr + la, DUl'.
'fs)(donne, N:fs + donner, V.'PIs + donner, V:P3sdonnel; V: S l s + donne r,V: S3s +donner, V.' Y2s )la can be a pronoun or a determiner; donne is anoun, or 5 conjugated forms of the verb donner.INTEX then builds the corresponding minimalautomaton: the number of transitions of thisautomaton corresponds to the number of lexicalambiguities of the text (in the above example: 9transitions).
By selecting and applying localgrammars to the text, the user effectively removestransitions in the resulting automaton.
Forinstance, thanks to a simple local grammar(which describes the preverbal particles), theabove text can be parsed to give the followingexpression:it, PROla, PRO:fs(donner, V.'P3s + donner, V:S3s)The remaining ambiguity corresponds to thetense of the verb: indicative or subjunctivepresent.
The corresponding automaton has only 4transitions.
Hence, the number of transitions canbe used as a quantitative tool to measure the effi-ciency of the removal of ambiguities.
By select-ing one local grammar at a time, or by mergingseveral, the user is able to apprehend exactly howeach grammar covers the text, and pcrlbnns interms of deleting transitions.CONCLUSIONINTEX is used for several purposes:--lexicographers who build dictionaries forcompounds (or technical terms) try to find newones by applying characteristic patterns to bigcorpora, such as: <N> (de + d' + de la + du +des) <N>;-- l inguists who study specific syntactic struc-tures use INTEX to find attestations of thesestructures.
For instance, one may search for thefollowing structure in order to find predicativenouns associated to the support verbs avob; don-net; Ftre, Jaire:( <avoir> + <donner> +<~tre > + <fai re >)(<ADV> + <E>) <N>- -our  objective is to build a large grammarwhich covers as much of the language as possi-ble.
By applying "pieces" of grammar to big cor-pora, and then studying the outputs, one cancorrect and refine each piece, and incrementallydevelop the global grammar;- - INTEX is used to find "semantic units" inlarge technical texts, hence it constitutes a goodinformation retrieval system.REFERENCESCourtois, B., Silberztcin M.
