Proceedings of the 5th ACL-HLT Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities, pages 105?114,Portland, OR, USA, 24 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsFrom Once Upon a Time to Happily Ever After:Tracking Emotions in Novels and Fairy TalesSaif MohammadInstitute for Information TechnologyNational Research Council CanadaOttawa, Ontario, Canada, K1A 0R6saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.caAbstractToday we have access to unprecedentedamounts of literary texts.
However, searchstill relies heavily on key words.
In this pa-per, we show how sentiment analysis can beused in tandem with effective visualizations toquantify and track emotions in both individualbooks and across very large collections.
Weintroduce the concept of emotion word den-sity, and using the Brothers Grimm fairy talesas example, we show how collections of textcan be organized for better search.
Using theGoogle Books Corpus we show how to deter-mine an entity?s emotion associations from co-occurring words.
Finally, we compare emo-tion words in fairy tales and novels, to showthat fairy tales have a much wider range ofemotion word densities than novels.1 IntroductionLiterary texts, such as novels, fairy tales, fables, ro-mances, and epics have long been channels to con-vey emotions, both explicitly and implicitly.
Withwidespread digitization of text, we now have easyaccess to unprecedented amounts of such literarytexts.
Project Gutenberg provides access to 34,000books (Lebert, 2009).1 Google is providing ac-cess to n-gram sequences and their frequencies frommore than 5.2 million digitized books, as part ofthe Google Books Corpus (GBC) (Michel et al,2011a).2 However, techniques to automatically ac-cess and analyze these books still rely heavily on key1Project Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org2GBC: http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasetsword searches alone.
In this paper, we show howsentiment analysis can be used in tandem with ef-fective visualizations to quantify and track emotionsin both individual books and across very large col-lections.
This serves many purposes, including:1.
Search: Allowing search based on emotions.For example, retrieving the darkest of theBrothers Grimm fairy tales, or finding snippetsfrom the Sherlock Holmes series that build thehighest sense of anticipation and suspense.2.
Social Analysis: Identifying how books haveportrayed different people and entities overtime.
For example, what is the distribution ofemotion words used in proximity to mentionsof women, race, and homosexuals.
(Similar tohow Michel et al (2011b) tracked fame by ana-lyzing mentions in the Google Books Corpus.)3.
Comparative analysis of literary works, gen-res, and writing styles: For example, is the dis-tribution of emotion words in fairy tales sig-nificantly different from that in novels?
Dowomen authors use a different distribution ofemotion words than their male counterparts?Did Hans C. Andersen use emotion words dif-ferently than Beatrix Potter?4.
Summarization: For example, automaticallygenerating summaries that capture the differentemotional states of the characters in a novel.5.
Analyzing Persuasion Tactics: Analyzing emo-tion words and their role in persuasion (Man-nix, 1992; Bales, 1997).In this paper, we describe how we use a large word?emotion association lexicon (described in Section1053.1) to create a simple emotion analyzer (Section3.2).
We present a number of visualizations that helptrack and analyze the use of emotion words in indi-vidual texts and across very large collections, whichis especially useful in Applications 1, 2, and 3 de-scribed above (Section 4).
We introduce the con-cept of emotion word density, and using the Broth-ers Grimm fairy tales as an example, we show howcollections of text can be organized for better search(Section 5).
Using the Google Books Corpus weshow how to determine emotion associations por-trayed in books towards different entities (Section6).
Finally, for the first time, we compare a collec-tion of novels and a collection of fairy tales usingan emotion lexicon to show that fairy tales have amuch wider distribution of emotion word densitiesthan novels.The emotion analyzer recognizes words with pos-itive polarity (expressing a favorable sentiment to-wards an entity), negative polarity (expressing anunfavorable sentiment towards an entity), and no po-larity (neutral).
It also associates words with joy,sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, antici-pation, which are argued to be the eight basic andprototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).This work is part of a broader project to pro-vide an affect-based interface to Project Gutenberg.Given a search query, the goal is to provide userswith relevant plots presented in this paper, as well asability to search for text snippets from multiple textsthat have high emotion word densities.2 Related workOver the last decade, there has been considerablework in sentiment analysis, especially in determin-ing whether a term has a positive or negative polar-ity (Lehrer, 1974; Turney and Littman, 2003; Mo-hammad et al, 2009).
There is also work in moresophisticated aspects of sentiment, for example, indetecting emotions such as anger, joy, sadness, fear,surprise, and disgust (Bellegarda, 2010; Mohammadand Turney, 2010; Alm et al, 2005; Alm et al,2005).
The technology is still developing and it canbe unpredictable when dealing with short sentences,but it has been shown to be reliable when drawingconclusions from large amounts of text (Dodds andDanforth, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2008).Automatic analysis of emotions in text has so farhad to rely on small emotion lexicons.
The WordNetAffect Lexicon (WAL) (Strapparava and Valitutti,2004) has a few hundred words annotated with as-sociations to a number of affect categories includingthe six Ekman emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear,disgust, and surprise).3 General Inquirer (GI) (Stoneet al, 1966) has 11,788 words labeled with 182 cat-egories of word tags, including positive and negativepolarity.4 We use the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mo-hammad and Yang, 2011; Mohammad and Turney,2010), a large set of human-provided word?emotionassociation ratings, in our experiments.5Empirical assessment of emotions in literary textshas sometimes relied on human annotation of thetexts, but this has restricted the number of texts an-alyzed.
For example, Alm and Sproat (2005) an-notated 22 Brothers Grimm fairy tales to show thatfairy tales often began with a neutral sentence andended with a happy sentence.
Here we use out-of-context word?emotion associations and analyze in-dividual texts to very large collections.
We rely oninformation from many words to provide a strongenough signal to overcome individual errors due toout-of-context annotations.3 Emotion Analysis3.1 Emotion LexiconThe NRC Emotion Lexicon was created by crowd-sourcing to Amazon?s Mechanical Turk, and it is de-scribed in (Mohammad and Yang, 2011; Moham-mad and Turney, 2010); we briefly summarize be-low.The 1911 Roget Thesaurus was used as the sourcefor target terms.6 Only those thesaurus words thatoccurred more than 120,000 times in the Google n-gram corpus were annotated for version 0.92 of thelexicon which we use for the experiments describedin this paper.7The Roget?s Thesaurus groups related words intoabout a thousand categories, which can be thought of3WAL: http://wndomains.fbk.eu/wnaffect.html4GI: http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/?inquirer5Please send an e-mail to saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.cato obtain the latest version of the NRC Emotion Lexicon.6Roget?s Thesaurus: www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106817The Google N-gram Corpus is available through the Lin-guistic Data Consortium.106as coarse senses or concepts (Yarowsky, 1992).
If aword is ambiguous, then it is listed in more than onecategory.
Since a word may have different emotionassociations when used in different senses, word-sense level annotations were obtained by first ask-ing an automatically generated word-choice ques-tion pertaining to the target:Q1.
Which word is closest in meaning to shark (target)??
car ?
tree ?
fish ?
oliveThe near-synonym for Q1 is taken from the the-saurus, and the distractors are randomly chosenwords.
This question guides the annotator to the de-sired sense of the target word.
It is followed by tenquestions asking if the target is associated with pos-itive sentiment, negative sentiment, anger, fear, joy,sadness, disgust, surprise, trust, and anticipation.The questions were phrased exactly as described inMohammad and Turney (2010).If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then in-formation obtained from the remaining questions isdiscarded.
Thus, even though there were no goldstandard correct answers to the emotion associationquestions, likely incorrect annotations were filteredout.
About 10% of the annotations were discardedbecause of an incorrect response to Q1.Each term was annotated by 5 different people.For 74.4% of the instances, all five annotators agreedon whether a term is associated with a particularemotion or not.
For 16.9% of the instances four outof five people agreed with each other.
The informa-tion from multiple annotators for a particular termwas combined by taking the majority vote.
The lex-icon has entries for about 24,200 word?sense pairs.The information from different senses of a word wascombined by taking the union of all emotions asso-ciated with the different senses of the word.
Thisresulted in a word-level emotion association lexiconfor about 14,200 word types.3.2 Text AnalysisGiven a target text, the system determines which ofthe words exist in our emotion lexicon and calculatesratios such as the number of words associated withan emotion to the total number of emotion words inthe text.
This simple approach may not be reliablein determining if a particular sentence is expressinga certain emotion, but it is reliable in determining ifa large piece of text has more emotional expressionsFigure 1: Emotions pie chart of Shakespeare?s tragedyHamlet.

)Figure 2: Emotions pie chart of Shakespeare?s comedyAs you like it.

)Figure 3: Difference in percentage scores for each of theeight basic emotions in Hamlet and As you like it.compared to others in a corpus.
Example applica-tions include clustering literary texts based on thedistributions of emotion words, analyzing gender-differences in email (Mohammad and Yang, 2011),and detecting spikes in anger words in close proxim-ity to mentions of a target product in a twitter stream(D?
?az and Ruz, 2002; Dube?
and Maute, 1996).4 Visualizations of Emotions4.1 Distributions of Emotion WordsFigures 1 and 2 show the percentages of emotionwords in Shakespeare?s famous tragedy, Hamlet, andhis comedy, As you like it, respectively.
Figure 3conveys the difference between the two novels evenmore explicitly by showing only the difference inpercentage scores for each of the emotions.
Emo-107Figure 4: Hamlet - As You Like It: relative-salience wordcloud for trust words.Figure 5: Hamlet - As You Like It: relative-salience wordcloud for sadness words.tions are represented by colours as per a study onword?colour associations (Mohammad, 2011).Observe how one can clearly see that Hamlet hasmore fear, sadness, disgust, and anger, and less joy,trust, and anticipation.
The bar graph is effective atconveying the extent to which an emotion is moreprominent in one text than another, but it does notconvey the source of these emotions.
Therefore, wecalculate the relative salience of an emotion word wacross two target texts T1 and T2:RelativeSalience(w|T1, T2) =f1N1?f2N2(1)Where, f1 and f2 are the frequencies of w in T1 andT2, respectively.
N1 and N2 are the total numberof word tokens in T1 and T2.
Figures 4 and 5 de-pict snippets of relative-salience word clouds of trustwords and sadness words across Hamlet and As YouLike it.
Our emotion analyzer uses Google?s freelyavailable software to create word clouds.88Google word cloud: http://visapi-gadgets.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wordcloud/doc.htmlFigure 6: Timeline of the emotions in As You Like It.Figure 7: Timeline of the emotions in Hamlet.Figure 8: Timeline of the emotions in Frankenstein.4.2 Flow of EmotionsLiterary researchers as well as casual readers may beinterested in noting how the use of emotion wordshas varied through the course of a book.
Figure 6, 7,and 8 show the flow of joy, trust, and fear in As YouLike it (comedy), Hamlet (tragedy), and Franken-stein (horror), respectively.
As expected, the visu-alizations depict the novels to be progressively moredark than the previous ones in the list.
Also thatFrankenstein is much darker in the final chapters.5 Emotion Word DensityApart from determining the relative percentage ofdifferent words, the use of emotion words in a bookcan also be quantified by calculating the number ofemotion words one is expected to see on reading ev-ery X words.
We will refer to this metric as emotionword density.
All emotion densities reported in thispaper are for X = 10, 000.
The dotted line in Fig-ure 9 shows the negative word density plot of 192fairy tales collected by Brothers Grimm.
The joy108Figure 9: The Brothers Grimm fairy tales arranged in increasing order of negative word density (number of negativewords in every 10,000 words).
The plot is of 192 stories but the x-axis has labels for only a few due to lack of space.A user may select any two tales, say Cinderella and Godfather Death (follow arrows), to reveal Figure 10.Figure 10: The difference in percentages of emotionwords across Cinderella and Godfather Death.Figure 11: Cinderella - Godfather Death: Relativesalience word cloud of joy.and sadness word densities are also shown?the thinand thick lines, respectively.
A person interested inunderstanding the use of emotion words in the fairytales collected by Brothers Grimm can further se-lect any two fairy tales from the plot, to reveal a bargraph showing the difference in percentages of emo-tions in the two texts.
Figure 10 shows the differencebar graph of Cinderella and Godfather Death.
Fig-ures 11 depicts the relative-salience word cloud ofjoy words across the two fairy tales.
The relative-salience word cloud of fear included: death, ill, be-ware, poverty, devil, astray, risk, illness, threaten-ing, horrified and revenge.6 Emotions Associated with TargetsWords found in proximity of target entities can begood indicators of emotions associated with the tar-gets.
Google has released n-gram frequency datafrom all the books they have scanned up to July15, 2009.9 The data consists of 5-grams along withthe number of times they were used in books pub-lished in every year from 1600 to 2009.
We an-alyzed the 5-gram files (about 800GB of data) toquantify the emotions associated with different tar-get entities.
We ignored data from books publishedbefore 1800 as that period is less comprehensivelycovered by Google books.
We chose to group thedata into five-year bins, though other groupings arereasonable as well.
Given a target entity of interest,the system identifies all 5-grams that contain the tar-get word, identifies all the emotion words in thosen-grams (other than the target word itself), and cal-culates percentages of emotion words.Figure 12 shows the percentage of fear wordsin the n-grams of different countries.
Observe,that there is a marked rise of fear words aroundWorld War I (1914?1918) for Germany, America,and China.
There is a spike for China around 1900,likely due to the unrest leading up to the Boxer Re-bellion (1898?1901).10 The 1810?1814 spike for9Google books data: http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets.10http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer Rebellion109Figure 12: Percentage of fear words in close proximity to occurrences of America, China, Germany, and India inbooks from the year 1800 to 2004.

Figures 14 shows similar curvesfor anger words.11http://www.iias.nl/nl/36/IIAS NL36 07.pdf12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit India Movement13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India in World War II7 Emotion Words in Novels vs. Fairy TalesNovels and fairy tales are two popular forms of liter-ary prose.
Both forms tell a story, but a fairy tale hascertain distinct characteristics such as (a) archetypalcharacters (peasant, king) (b) clear identification ofgood and bad characters, (c) happy ending, (d) pres-ence of magic and magical creatures, and (d) a clearmoral (Jones, 2002).
Fairy tales are extremely popu-lar and appeal to audiences through emotions?theyconvey personal concerns, subliminal fears, wishes,and fantasies in an exaggerated manner (Kast, 1993;Jones, 2002; Orenstein, 2003).
However, there havenot been any large-scale empirical studies to com-pare affect in fairy tales and novels.
Here for thefirst time, we compare the use of emotion-associatedwords in fairy tales and novels using a large lexicon.Specifically, we are interested in determiningwhether: (1) fairy tales on average have a higheremotional density than novels, (2) different fairytales focus on different emotions such that somefairy tales have high densities for certain emotion,whereas others have low emotional densities forthose same emotions.We used the Corpus of English Novels (CEN) andthe Fairy Tale Corpus (FTC) for our experiments.14The Corpus of English Novels is a collection of292 novels written between 1881 and 1922 by 25British and American novelists.
It was compiledfrom Project Gutenberg at the Catholic Universityof Leuven by Hendrik de Smet.
It consists of about26 million words.
The Fairy Tale Corpus (Lobo andMartins de Matos, 2010) has 453 stories, close to1 million words, downloaded from Project Guten-14CEN: https://perswww.kuleuven.be/?u0044428/cen.htmFTC: https://www.l2f.inesc-id.pt/wiki/index.php/Fairy tale corpus110anger anticip.

Even though many fairy tales have a strongoral tradition, the stories in this collection were com-piled, translated, or penned in the 19th century bythe Brothers Grimm, Beatrix Potter, and Hans C.Andersen to name a few.We calculated the polarity and emotion word den-sity of each of the novels in CEN and each of thefairy tales in FTC.
Table 1 lists the mean densitiesas well as standard deviation for each of the eightbasic emotions in the two corpora.
We find that themean densities for anger and sadness across CENand FTC are not significantly different.
However,fairy tales have significantly higher anticipation, dis-gust, joy, and surprise densities when compared tonovels (p < 0.001).
On the other hand, they havesignificantly lower trust word density than novels.Further, the standard deviations for all eight emo-tions are significantly different across the two cor-pora (p < 0.001).
The fairy tales, in general, havea much larger standard deviation than the novels.Thus for each of the 8 emotions, there are more fairytales than novels having high emotion densities andthere are more fairy tales than novels having lowemotion densities.Table 2 lists the mean densities as well as standarddeviation for negative and positive polarity words inthe two corpora.
The table states, for example, thatfor every 10,000 words in the CEN, one can expectto see about 1670 negative words.
We find that fairytales, on average, have a significantly lower numberof negative terms, and a significantly higher numberof positive words (p < 0.001).In order to obtain a better sense of the distribu-tion of emotion densities, we generated histogramsby counting all texts that had emotion densities be-tween 0?99, 100?199, 200?399, and so on.
A largestandard deviation for fairy tales could be due toone of at least two reasons: (1) the histogram hasa bimodal distribution?most of the fairy tales haveextreme emotion densities (either much higher thanthat of the novels, or much smaller).
(2) the his-togram approaches a normal distribution such thatnegative positivemean ?

Figures 15 through 20 show histogramscomparing novels and fairy tales for positive andnegative polarities, as well as for a few emotions.Observe that fairy tales do not have a bimodal distri-bution, and case (2) holds true.8 Conclusions and Future WorkWe presented an emotion analyzer that relies on thepowerful word?emotion association lexicon.
Wepresented a number of visualizations that help trackand analyze the use of emotion words in individ-ual texts and across very large collections.
We in-troduced the concept of emotion word density, andusing the Brothers Grimm fairy tales as an exam-ple, we showed how collections of text can be or-ganized for better search.
Using the Google BooksCorpus we showed how to determine emotion asso-ciations portrayed in books towards different enti-ties.
Finally, for the first time, we compared a col-lection of novels and a collection of fairy tales usingthe emotion lexicon to show that fairy tales have amuch wider distribution of emotion word densitiesthan novels.This work is part of a broader project to pro-vide an affect-based interface to Project Gutenberg.Given a search query, the goal is to provide userswith relevant plots presented in this paper.
Further,they will be able to search for snippets from multipletexts that have strong emotion word densities.AcknowledgmentsGrateful thanks to Peter Turney and Tara Small formany wonderful ideas.
