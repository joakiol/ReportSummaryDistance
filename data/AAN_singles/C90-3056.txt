25A,BG - 1113 Sofia,BulgariaAbstrae%:A framework for the description of syntacticstructures of free word order languages is proposed,based on combination of intuitions underlying imme-diate constituent description, dependency descriptionand communicative dynamism.
The combined approach iscompared to its sources and shown superior in descrip-tive power, esp.
in the area of free intermixing of(any number of) adjuncts with complements and in coor-dination.
Close resemblance to two other recent ap-proaches is pointed out.I.
Syz~tactic Structures for Free Word OrderThe absolute major i ty of current l inguisticframeworks characterize syntactic structures of natu-ral languages in predominantly static terms, payingonly minimal or no attel~tion to the communicativefunction ef language and its ref lection in the processof utterlng/understandlng (generation/parsing) senten-ces.In the case of generative frameworks based oni~nedlate constituent approaches to .language de-scr~ptlon, this can be ascribed (at least partly) tothe fact that many of them (GB, LFG, GPSG, TAGS, tomention the most widespread ones) were created prima-rlly for the sake of description of English, a highlyconfiguratlonal language in which the impact ofcommunicative functions on syntactic structure isquite l imited (at least in comparison with the so-ca!-led free-word-order languages - henceforth FWOLs).The frameworks based on the dependency syntax(e.g., the "Meaning-Text" model of Mel'chuk and Apre-syan, the "Functional Generat ive Description" of Sgallet al, the "Word Grammar" of Hudson), on the otherhand, by the very principle separate l inguisticstructures from the process of generation/parsing sosharply that even if any reflection of the communica-tive process is present in the generation/parsing pro-cedures, it gets lost in the resulting structures andhas to be added there (if needed) more or \]ess artif i-cially, e.g., in the form of different indices (cf.the structures in Sgall et el, 1986).This lack of reflection of communicative aspectsof language in the (syntactic) structures, togetherwith still other features of the abovementioned frame-works (such as, for the immediate constituent basedapproaches, the incapabil ity of the standard "S --> NPVP" approach to describe, e.g., the +'Object-Subject-Verb" constltuent order, or this obstacle overcome insome way, the problems connected with free intermixingof any number of free adjuncts among the complements,and, for the dependency based approaches, the problemsinvolved in capturing even quite simple instances ofcoordination), make relatively profound adjustments inthe exist ing frameworks or development of a new one anecessary and highly important task if a language in-volving broad impact of the communicative aspects onits syntactic structures (such as the FWOLs) has to bedescribed formally in such a way that the descriptioncan be directly implemented on a computer and functionas a generator or a parser.The easiest way how to overcome the diff icult lesconnected with the current frameworks and to achievethe abovementioned goal of creating a framework suit-able for a reasonable description of FWOLs as well asfor an easy and efficient computer implementationseemed to be to augment the immediate eonstltuent ba-sed nontransformatlonal approaches (which are easierto implement due to the clearcut correspondence be-tween the rules of the grammar and the structures theygenerate) with tile intultions contained in more tradi-tional descriptions of the FWOLs as well as in the de-scriptions of functional sentence perspective and com~municatlve dynamism (Firhas,1971,1975; Sga!l etai,1973).In the unmarked case, the scale of co~nunicativedynamism allows for splitt ing the sentence or arty ofits parts on the level of the  "main" constituel\]ts(such as Subject, Object, different verbal Adjunctsetc.)
at any moment into two parts, the first con+sisting of the constituent being processes (uttered,expanded) at the very moment, i+e.
the currently leastdynamic constituent, and the second one consisting ofthe "rest" of the sentence, i.e.
of all the consti~tuents more dynamic than the currently processed one.This results in a non-transformational accounc of syn-tactic structures, in the form of binary right-branch-ing trees (if the division sketched above is broadenedto all constituent types used in the description).
Artexample of the structure for the notorious sentence"John loves Mary" is given in (I).
(Mind the rightmost"Rest S" nonterminal dominating an empty string:"nothing more is to" be uttered" in the sentence,"nothing is more dynamic" than "Mary".

Juston the contrary, the approach results in a drasticsimplif ication of the number and shape of rulesneeded: one gross rule scheme (2) is sufficient forthe whole grammar:(2) ~ ~ a t  is to be 1\[be expandedJ lexpanded NO~AIn this scheme, the second constituent on the righthand side is always the phrasal head; accozding to thenature of the left daughter, the rule set can be furt-her factorized into the fol lowing subsets reflectingthe classical l inguistic wisdom: ru\]es expanding thelexical head, rules expanding a complement, rules ex-panding a free adjunct, rules expandi~g an extraposedconstituent, rules expanding a member of a coordinatedstructure, rules expanding minor categories(conjunctions, particles etc.}.
Such a division is im-1 311portan5 not only because it brings along some more pu-rity and perspicuity, but also because it allows for astraightforward implementation of different featureinheritance principles of the framework (such as theHead Feature Principle, Subcategorization Principleetc.)
in the computer variant of the grammar; on areasonable formal notation of the grammar rules al-lowing marking off the type of the rule as the pro-perty of the rule itself, it is possible to bound theappl ication of the principles to the whole rule typesrather than to each rule separately, as the case oftenis in many current parsers (e.g., for a head daughterin a rule, it is not necessary to stipulate explicit lythe sharing of its head features with the mother,since this is provided for by listing the rule in theclass of headexpand ing  rules).2.
Relat ion to other Syntactic FrameworksThe proposed structures might seem ratherunconventional at first glance; however, their re-lation to structures used in more usual syntacticframeworks can be shown to be quite straightforward insimple cases.
All what is needed to obtain dependencytrees is to factorize the set of nodes of the describ-ed structures by all bar projections of a single ter-minal node.
An X-structure can be obtained by facto-rizing the set of nodes by projections of the samebar~level of a single terminal node.In more complicated cases, however, thefactorizations sketched above cannot be performed.Exactly in these cases, the structures proposed rankbetter in describing at least the following phenomenaof FWOLs:in relation to dependency syntax (tradi-t ional ly used for description of FWOLs), first of allin describing coordination, but also the so-callednon-proJectlve constructions (e.g., unbounded depen-dencies) as well as cases where contact posit ion ofcertain words or constituents is required or positionsare to be strictly fixed even in FWOLs (e.g., the Wac-kernaGel's posit ion of clitlcs), which both is diffi-cult to achieve in dependency descriptions if non-pro-jective constructions are allowed to occur since these~nterfere with the "basic" projective ordering gene-rated- in relation to standard variants of X-syn-tax, the approach adopted solves the problems with theposit ion of subject, with free intermixing of comple-ments and adjuncts and, in addition, it is able tocope with certain cases of "heavy" coordination (seebelow) on a context-free basis.3.
suboategorizat ion and Coomdinat lonGeneral ly speaking, the intuitions (as opposed tothe formalism) standing behind the framework are veryclose to (if not the same as) those supporting depen-dency approaches (certainly more so than to theintultions of the majority of current immediate con-stituent approaches, cf., e.g., the nonexistence ofthe "NP/VP" division of a sentence), but the structu-res developed for the formal incarnation of these in-tuit ions have by far more descriptive power than thestandard formalizations proposed for the dependencyapproaches.
This extra power (even in comparison withthe standard X-approaches) stems mainly from the in-creased number of nonterminal symbols: the greaternumber of nonterminals allows for a more subtle struc-tul lng of the terminal string.The crucial point of this refinement of structu-ral information is the one concerning sub-categorization of phrases.
In accordance with thetreatment of subcategorization in HPSG and other fra-meworksr subcategorization can be informally viewed asthe number and shape of constituents to be added to apart icular phrase for it to become a saturated projec-tion of its lexical head (e.g., for a VP, this subca-tegorizat lon is the number and shape of constituentsto be added for the VP to become a sentence; thus, asentence is Just an alias for a VP with empty subcate-gorization).
In the example (3), it is important tonotice the "sharing" of the subcategorizatlon re-quirements (depicted schematical ly as sets of subcate-gorlzed-for elements associated with the nonterminalnodes of the structure) between the lexlcal head ofthe sentence (the verb) and its rlghtmost phrasalprojection, as well as the stepwlse right-to-left re-duction of the subcategorizat ion requirements of theVP's, and also the fact that the expansion of a lexi-col head or a free adjunct does not affect the subca-tegorization.

The instances wehave in mind are "Right Node Raising" and "Across theBoard" coordinations exemplif ied in (4) and (5),respectively.

(5) the pie Mary baked and John ateBefore presenting the treatment proper, two mattershave to be pointed out:- first, in FWOLs "Right Node Raising" and"Across the Board" are exactly the same cases of coor-dinative constructions (due to the free-word-order,the posit ion of the "extracted" constituent plays nosyntactic role)- second, the grammatical ity of other cases ofcoordination can be order dependent, even in FWOLs:typical case is "Gapping" (of.
the contrast shown forEnglish in (6)a,b but holding also in (at least) Bul-garian, Czech, Polish, Russian and Slovak), somewhatunclear is the situation with "Non-Constituent Coordi-nation", where speakers of the sbovementioned !an-guages seem to have different opinions about the gram-matical i ty of the respective counterparts of (7)b.

(7) a. John gave a book to Maryand a bunch of flowers to Sue.b.

A book to Mary anda bunch of flowers to Sue John gave.This corroborates the view that (6)a,(7)a are in-stances of some extragrammatlcal communicative pro-cesses (i.e.
processes not reflected in the grammar ofthe language - such as the tendency to avoid utteringidentical parts of coordinated structures etc.)
ratherthan true cases of "coordinated predication" whichseems to be the case with "Right Node Raising" and"Across the Board".The treatment of "Right Node Raising" and"Across the Board" relies fully on the refinement ofsubcategorization into the increased number of nodesof the structure, but on the other hand it does notrequire any augmentation of the coordination mecha-nisms of the framework, the only coordination rulebeing the "coordination of likes".
The approach evenallows for descript ion of constructions where "RightNode Raising" and "Across the Board" cooccur.
Thestructure assigned to such cases is given in (8) (theterminal string of which is quite probably no goodEnglish, but translations into the FWOLs tested areconsidered fully acceptable).312 2(8) .~ VP }0 "-'~ ~P ( SUBJ }John ~ ~/ ~  IP { SU\[~J, (}BJ} Z )~VP { SUBJ, OBd } "~'~'~---~ / } / ~ 3  VP {SUBJ}i ought and later {lave / ~ VPyesterday to Sue ~ ~ { SUBJ, OBJ}some app\] esNote  that the term "\]exica\] head" should be taken witha grain of salt for the  VP in (8) {as well as for all{)(her coordinative constructions) - this is, hog, ever,a purely termirlologlca\] matter which can be coped witheasily in a ful\]f\]edged exposit ion of the theory andi~as no bearing on its validity.

a set of declar\]t lvely statedrewziting rules) for the description of the language,which in turn guarantees a clear correspondence be-tween the structures of the language and the mechanismthat generates them.
