Hindi and Marathi to English Cross Language InformationManoj Kumar Chinnakotla, Sagar Ranadive, Om P. Damani and PushpakBhattacharyyaAbstractIn this paper, we present our Hindi ->English and Marathi ->English CLIRsystems developed as part of our participation in the CLEF 2007 Ad-HocBilingual task.
We take a query translation based approach using bi-lingualdictionaries.
Query words not found in the dictionary are transliterated usinga simple lookup table based transliteration approach.
The resultanttransliteration is then compared with the index items of the corpus to returnthe `k' closest English index words of the given Hindi/Marathi word.
Theresulting multiple translation/transliteration choices for each query word aredisambiguated using an iterative page-rank style algorithm, proposed in theliterature, which makes use of term-term co-occurrence statistics to producethe final translated query.
Using the above approach, for Hindi, we achieve aMean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.2366 in title which is 61.36% ofmonolingual performance and a MAP of 0.2952 in title and descriptionwhich is 67.06% of monolingual performance.
For Marathi, we achieve aMAP of 0.2163 in title which is 56.09% of monolingual performance.
