iCompiling Bilingual Lexicon EntriesFrom a Non-Parallel English-Chinese CorpusPascale Fung 1Computer Science DepartmentColumbia UniversityNew York, NY 10027pascale@cs, columbia, eduAbstractWe propose anovel context heterogeneity similarity measure between words and their translationsin helping to compile bilingual lexicon entries from a non-parallel English-Chinese corpus.
Currentalgorithms for bilingual exicon compilation rely on occurrence frequencies, length or positional statisticsderived from parallel texts.
There is little correlation between such statistics of a word and its translationin non-parallel corpora.
On the other hand, we suggest that words with productive context in one languagetranslate to words with productive context in another language, and words with rigid context ranslateinto words With rigid context.
Context heterogeneity measures how productive the context of a word is ina given domain, independent of its absolute occurrence frequency in the text.
Based on this information,we derive statistics of bilingual word pairs from a non-parallel corpus.
These statistics can be used tobootstrap a bilingual dictionary compilation algorithm.1 IntroductionBuilding a domain-specific bilingual lexicon is one significant component in machine translation andmachine-aided translation systems.
These terms are often not found in standard ictionaries.
Humantranslators, not being experts in every technical or regional domain, cannot produce their translations effec-tively.
Automatic:compilation of such a bilingual exicon in specific domains is therefore highly desirable.We present an algorithm in finding word correlation statistics for automatic bilingual exicon compilationfrom a non-parallel corpus in Chinese and English.
Most previous automatic lexicon compilation techniquesrequire a sentence-aligned clean parallel bilingual corpus (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano& Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al 1993; Wu & Xia 1994).
We have previously shown an algorithm whichextracts abilingual exicon from noisy parallel corpus without sentence alignment (Fung & McKeown 1994;Fung 1995).
Although bilingual parallel corpora have been available in recent years, they are still relativelyfew in comparison to the large amount of monolingual text.
Acquiring and processing of parallel corporaare usually labour-intensive and time-consuming.
More importantly, the existence of a parallel corpus ina particular domain means some translator has translated it, therefore, the bilingual exicon compiled fromsuch a corpus is at best a reverse ngineering of the lexicon this translator used.
On the other hand, if we cancompile a dictionary of domain-specific words from non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts, the resultswould be much more meaningful and useful.This research ispartly supported by the Department ofElectrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Scienceand Technology.173As demonstrated in all the bilingual exicon compilation algorithms, the foremost task is to identify wordfeatures which are similar between a word and its translation, yet different between a word and other wordswhich are not its translations.
In parallel corpora, this feature could be the positional co-occurrence ofa wordand its translation in the other language in the same sentences (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994;Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al 1993; Wu & Xia 1994) or in the same segments (Fung & Church1994; Fung 1995).
In a non-parallel corpus, there is no corresponding sentence or segment pairs, so theco-occurrence f ature is not applicable.
In Fung & McKeown (1994); Fung (1995), the word feature usedwas the positional difference vector.
Whereas this is more robust han sentence co-occurrence f ature, thematching between two positional difference vectors presumes the two texts are rough translations of oneanther.
Moreover, whereas the occurrence frequency of a word and that of its translation are relatively similarin a parallel corpus, they have little correlation in non-parallel texts.
Our task is, therefore, to identify aword feature correlating apair of words even if they appear in texts which are not translations of each other.This feature should also be language and character set independent, i.e.
it should be applicable to pairs oflanguages very different from each other.
We propose that context heterogeneity is such a feature.2 A Non-parallel Corpus of Chinese and EnglishWe use parts of the HKUST English-Chinese Bilingual Corpora for our experiments (Wu 1994), consistingof transcriptions of the Hong Kong Legislative Council debates in both English and Chinese.
We use thedata from 1988-1992, taking the first 73618 sentences from the English text, and the next 73618 sentencesfrom the Chinese text.
There are no overlapping sentences between the texts.
The topic of these debatesvaries though is to some extent confined to the same domain, namely the political and social issues of HongKong.
Although we select he same number of sentences from each language, there are 22147 unique wordsfrom English, and only 7942 unique words from Chinese.3 Some Linguistic Characteristics of ChineseWe have chosen Chinese and English as the two languages from which we will build a bilingual dictionary.Since these languages are significantly different, we need to develop an algorithm which does not rely onany similarity between the languages, and which can be readily extended to other language pairs.It is useful to point out some significant differences between Chinese and English in order to help explainthe output of our experiments:Chinese texts have no word delimiters.
It is necessary to perform tokenization on the text by using aChinese tokenizer.
Since the tokenizer is not perfect, the word translation extraction process is affectedby this preprocessing.Chinese part-of-speech lasses are very ambiguous; many words can be both adjective or noun, nounor verb.
Many adjectives can also act as adverbs with no morphological change.Chinese words have little or no morphological information.
There are no inflections for nouns, adjec-tives or verbs to indicate gender, number, case, tense or person (Xi 1985).
There is no capitalizationto indicate the beginning of a sentence.There are very few function words in Chinese compared to other languages, especially to English.Moreover, function words in Chinese are frequently omitted.1745 A vast number of acronyms are employed in Chinese, which means many single words in Chinese canbe translated into compound words in English.
Hong Kong Chinese use many terms borrowed fromclassical Chinese which tend to be more concise.
The usage of idioms in Chinese is significantly morefrequent than in English.Points 3,4, and 5 contribute to the fact that the Chinese text of our corpus has fewer unique words thanin English.4 Context Heterogeneity of a WordIn a non-parallel Corpus, a domain-specific term and its translation are used in different sentences in the twotexts.
Take the example of the word air in the English text.
Its concordance is shown partly in Table 4.
Itoccurred 176 times.
Its translation ~ occurred 37 times in the Chinese text and part of its concordance isshown in Table 4, They are used in totally different sentences.
Thus, we cannot hope that their occurrencefrequencies would correspond to each other in any significant way.On the other hand, a i r /~  are domain-specific words in the text, meaning something we breathe, asopposed to of some kind of ambiance or attitude.
They are used mostly in similar contexts, as shown inthe concordances.
If we look at the content word preceding air in the concordance, and the content wordfollowing it, we notice that air is not randomly paired with other words.
There are a limited number of wordbigrams (x, W) and a limited number of word bigrams (W, y) where W is the word air; likewise for ~ .The number of such unique bigrams indicate a degree of heterogeneity of this word in a text in terms of itsneighbors.We define the context heterogeneity vector of a word W to be an ordered pair (x, y) where:aleft heterogeneity x = - ;cbfight heterogeneity y = -;ca = number of different ypes of tokensimmediately preceding W in the text;b = number of different ypes of tokensimmediately following W in the text;c = number of occurrences of W in the text;The context heterogeneity of any function word, such as the, would have x and y values very close toone, since it can be preceded or followed by many different words.
On the other hand, the x value of theword am is small because it always follows the word I.We postulate that the context heterogeneity of a given domain-specific word is more similar to that of itstranslation in another language than that of an unrelated word in the other language, and that this is a moresalient feature than their occurrence frequencies in the two texts.For example, the context heterogeneity of air is (119/176, 47/176) = (0.676, 0.267) and the contextheterogeneity of its translation in Chinese, ~ is (29/37, 17/37) = (0.784, 0.459).
The context hetero-geneity of the word (~k~/adjournment, on the other hand, is (37/175, 16/175) = (0.211, 0.091).
Notice thatalthough air and (~k~ have similar occurrence frequencies, their context heterogeneities have very differenti175values, indicating that air has much more productive context han (~N.
On the other hand, gg~ has moresimilar context heterogeneity values as those of air even though its occurrence frequency in the Chinese textis much lower.Table 1" Part of the concordance for airWordpositionin text 1concordance87541432914431202943178086604102837118017118113119421people to enjoy fresh, is it possible for roomhouses and institutions.

We use the ordered pair based on the assumption that the word order for nouns in English and Chineseare similar most of the times.
For example, air pollution is translated into ~ .6 Filtering out Function Words in EnglishThere are many function words in English which do not translate into Chinese.
This is because in mostAsian languages, there are very few function words compared to Indo-European languages.
Function wordsin Chinese or Japanese are frequently omitted.
This partly contributes to the fact that there are far fewerChinese words than English words in two texts of similar lengths.Since these functions words such as the, a, of will affect the context heterogeneity of most nouns inEnglish while giving very little information, we filter them out from the English text.
This heuristic greatlyincreased the context heterogeneity values of many nouns.
The list of function words filtered out are the, a,an, this, that, of, by, for, in, to.
This is by no means a complete list of English function words.
More vigorousstatistical training methods could probably be developed to find out which function words in English haveno Chinese correspondences.
However, if one uses context heterogeneity in languages having more functionwords such as French, it is advisable that filtering be carried out on both texts.7 Experiment 1: Finding Word Translation CandidatesGiven the simplicity of our current context heterogeneity measures and the complexity of finding translationsfrom a non-parallel text in which many words will not find their translations, we propose to use contextheterogeneity only as a bootstrapping feature in finding a candidate list of translations for a word.In our first experiment, we hand-compiled a list of 58 word pairs as in Tables 3 and 4 in English andChinese, and then used 58 by 58 context heterogeneity measures to match them against each other.
Note thatthis list consists of many single character words which have ambiguities in Chinese, English words whichshould have been part of a compound word, multiple translations of a single word in English, etc.
The initialresults are revealing as shown by the histograms in Figure 1.14121086420~o~_match .

In the rightfigure, we show the result of filtering out the Chinese genitive ~ from the Chinese texts.
In this case, wecan see that over 50% of the words found their translation in the top 10 candidates, although it gives fewerwords with translations in top 5.In Sections 7.1 to 7.4, we will discuss the effects of various factors on our results.Table 3: Test set words - part oneEnglish word Chinese word possible Chinese POSBasicBritishCHIMCHOWCHOWChinaCommitteeCouncilDeclarationFinancialGovernmentGovernor~NNNNN'NHongKongLAMLAULawLtd~NN~NMcGREGORMr ~NOctober +~SECURITY t~Second .~-~TAMTU ~?WONGYIUnounnoun-adjambiguousambiguousambiguousnoun-adjnounambiguousnoun-verbnoun-adjnoun-adjnounproper nounproper nounambiguousproper nounnounnounambiguousnounnounnoun-verbnounproper nounambiguousambiguousambiguous7.1 Effect of Chinese TokenizationWe used a statistically augmented Chinese tokenizer for finding word boundaries in the Chinese text (Fung& Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994).
Chinese tokenization is a difficult problem and tokenizers always haveerrors.
Most single Chinese characters can be joined with other character(s) to form different words.
So thetranslation of a single Chinese character is ill-defined.
Moreover, in some cases, our Chinese tokenizer groupsfrequently co-occurring characters into a single word that does not have independent semantic meanings.For example, (~/ - th  item, number.
In the above cases, the context heterogeneity values of the Chinese178Table 4: Test set words - part twoEnglish word Chinese word possible Chinese POSaddressaircolleaguesdebatedecisionsdevelopmentemployersemploymentexpenditurefiguresgrowthincidentslandlandlawsmajorityproposalsprosperityqualityraterelationshiprights?~~g),.tll(human rights)nounnounnounnoun-verbnoun-verbnoun-verbnounnounnoun-verbnounnoun-verbnounquantifiernounnounnoun-adjnoun-verbnoun-adjambiguousambiguousnounnounrisksafetyservicessimplesteptargetstunnelsvesselswelfareyesterdayambiguousnoun-adjnoun-verbadjambiguousnounnounnounnounnountranslation is not reliable.
However, translators would recognize this error readily and would not consider itas a translation candidate.7.2 Effect of English Compound WordsAs we have mentioned, our Chinese text has many acronyms and idioms which were identified by ourtokenizer and grouped into a single word.
However, the English text did not under go a collocationextraction procesS.
We can use the following heuristic to overcome the problem:179For a given word Wi in a trigram of (Wi-1, Wi, Wi+l) with context heterogeneity (x, y):1 ifWi(x) = 12 W~(x) ~- W~_l(z);3 ifW~(y) = 14 Wi(y) ~ Wi+l(y);5 return (Wi(x), W~(y));Using this method, we have improved the context heterogeneity scores of ),,~/human rights, i~ i~/Basic Law, ,:-~/Second Reading and ~/Hong Kong.7.3 Effect of Words with Multiple FunctionsAs mentioned earlier, many Chinese words have multiple part-of-speech tags such as the "Chinese fordeclaration~declare, d velopment~developing, adjourned~adjournment, or expenditure~spend.
Thereforethese words have one-to-many mappings with English words.We could use part-of-speech taggers to label these words with different classes, effectively treating themas different words.Another way to reduce one-to-many mapping between Chinese and English words could be to use amorphological nalyzer in English to map all English words of the same roots with different case, gender,tense, number, capitalization to a single word type.7.4 Effect of Word OrderWe had assumed that the trigram word order in Chinese and English are similar.
Yet in a non-parallel text,nouns can appear either before a verb or after, as a subject or an object and thus, it is conceivable that weshould relax the distance measure to be:= ~/ (~ - ~)~ + (y~ - y~)~ + (~ - y~)~ + (yx - ~)~We applied this measure and indeed improved on the scores for nouns such as vessels, Government,employers, debate, prosperity.
In some other languages such as French and English, word order for trigramscontaining nouns could be reversed most of the time.
For example, air pollution would be translatedinto pollution d'air.
For adjective-noun pairs, Chinese, English and even Japanese share similar orders,whereas French has adjective-noun pairs in the reverse order most of the time.
So when we apply contextheterogeneity measures to word pairs in English and French, we might map the left heterogeneity in Englishto the right heterogeneity in French, and vice versa.8 Exper iment  2: F ind ing  the Word  Trans lat ion Among a C luster  o f  WordsThe above experiment showed to some extent he clustering ability of context heterogeneity.
To test thediscriminative ability of this feature, we choose two clusters of known English and Chinese word pairsdebate/~-~.
We obtained acluster of Chinese words centered around ~-~ by applying the Kvec segment co-occurrence score (Fung & Church 1994) on the Chinese text with itself.
The Kvec algorithm was previouslyused to find co-occurring bilingual word pairs with many candidates.
In our experiment, he co-occurrencehappens within the same text, and therefore we got a candidate list for ~-~ that is a cluster of words similar180ito it in terms of occurrence measure.
This cluster was proposed as a candidate translation list for debate.We applied context heterogeneity measures between debate and the Chinese word list, with the result shownin Table 5 with the best translation at the top.0.1173710~1492070~1558970~1583050:18569901200486012330630,2468260~255721012687710,2841340,3126370:3152100.3496080:3675390,3762380.3892960,3896930.4031400,404000Table 5: Sorted candidate list for debatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebatedebateI~/*,9-I-/*~/debate?~/resumption~k~/adjoumment~ ~ '~ l~/Amendment  stage of the Council~J-~+/*~/*Ji~--/*~-~/Second Reading~L~z.~/Second Reading of the Bill~ /*~L~~j~/moved to Second Reading of the Bill~ ~/Counc i l  Amendment~%/this afternoon~/ th i s  time~/Counc i l~ ~ / *~/*t '~ J~ i l~/Second Reading of the Bill passedThe asteriskslin Table 5 indicate tokenizer error.
The correct ranslation is the third candidate.
Althoughwe cannot say at this point that this result is significant, it is to some extent encouraging.It is interesting to note that if we applied the same Kvec algorithm to the English part of the text, we wouldget a cluster of English words which contain individual translations to some of the words in the Chinesecluster.
This shows that co-occurrence measure can give similar clusters of words in different languagesfrom non-parallel texts.9 Non-parallel Corpora Need to be Larger than Parallel CorporaAmong the 58 words we selected, there is one word service which occurred 926 times in the English text,but failed to appear even once in the Chinese text (presumably the Legco debate focused more on the issueof various public and legal services in Hong Kong during the 1988-90 time frame than later during 1991-92.And in English they frequently accuse ach other of paying lip service to various issues).
We expect herewould be a great flumber of words which simply do not have their translations in the other text.
Words whichoccur very few times also have unreliable context heterogeneity.
A logical way to cope with such sparse dataproblem is to use larger non-parallel corpora.
Our texts each have about 3 million words, which is muchsmaller than the parallel Canadian Hansard used for the same purposes.
Because it was divided into twoparts to form a non-parallel corpus, it is also half in size to the parallel corpus used for word alignment (Wu181& Xia 1994).
With a larger corpus, there will be more source words in the vocabulary for us to translate,and more target candidates tochoose from.10 Future WorkWe have explained that there are various immediate ways to improve context heterogeneity measures byincluding more linguistic information about Chinese and English such as word class correspondence andword order correspondence, as well as by using a larger context window.
Meanwhile, much larger non-parallel corpora re needed for compilation of bilingual exicons.
We are currently experimenting onusingsome other similarity measures between word pairs from non-parallel corpora.
We plan eventually toincorporate context heterogeneity measures and other word pair similarity measures into bilingual exiconlearning paradigms.11 ConclusionWe have shown the existence of statistical correlations between words and their translations even in a non-parallel corpus.
Context heterogeneity s such a correlation feature.
We have shown initial results of matchingwords with their translations in a English-Chinese non-parallel corpus by using context heterogeneitymeasures.
Context heterogeneity can be used both as a clustering measure and a discrimination measure.Given two corresponding clusters of words from the corpus, context heterogeneity could be used to furtherdivide and refine the clusters into few candidate translation words for a given word.
Its results can be usedto bootstrap or refine a bilingual exicon compilation algorithm.12 AcknowledgmentI wish to thank Kathleen McKeown and Ken Church for their advice and support, and AT&T Bell Laboratoriesfor use of software and equipments.ReferencesDAGAN, Ioo, KENNETH W.
