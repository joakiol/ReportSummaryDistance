Mork{neveola,mork,alan}@nlm.nih.govNational Library of Medicine8600 Rockville PikeBethesda, MD 20894USAAlan R. AronsonAbstractThe shift from paper to electronic docu-ments has caused the curation of informa-tion sources in large electronic databasesto become more generalized.
In the bio-medical domain, continuing efforts aim atrefining indexing tools to assist with theupdate and maintenance of databases suchas MEDLINE?.
In this paper, we evaluatetwo statistical methods of producingMeSH?
indexing recommendations forthe genetics literature, including recom-mendations involving subheadings, whichis a novel application for the methods.
Weshow that a generic representation of thedocuments yields both better precisionand recall.
We also find that a domain-specific representation of the documentscan contribute to enhancing recall.1 IntroductionThere are two major approaches for the automaticindexing of text documents: statistical approachesthat rely on various word counting techniques [su-ch as vector space models (Salton, 1989), LatentSemantic Indexing (Deerwester et al, 1990) orprobabilistic models (Sparck-Jones et al, 2000)]and linguistic approaches that involve syntacticaland lexical analysis [see for example term extrac-tion and term variation recognition in systems suchas MetaMap (Aronson, 2001), FASTR (Jacqueminand Tzoukermann, 1999) or IndDoc (Nazarenkoand Ait El Mekki, 2005)].
In many cases, the com-bination of these approaches has been shown toimprove the performance of a single approach bothfor controlled indexing (Aronson et al, 2004) andfree text indexing (Byrne and Klein, 2003).Recently, N?v?ol et al (2007) presented lin-guistic approaches for the indexing of documentsin the field of genetics.
In this paper, we explore astatistical approach of indexing for text documentsalso in the field of genetics.
This approach waspreviously used successfully to produce MedicalSubject Headings (MeSH) main heading recom-mendations.
Our goal in this experiment is two-fold: first, extending an existing method to the pro-duction of recommendations involving subhead-ings and second, assessing the possible benefit ofusing a domain-specific variant of the method.2 A k-Nearest-Neighbors approach forindexing2.1 PrincipleThe k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) approach viewsindexing as a multi-class classification problemwhere a document may be assigned several?classes?
in the form of indexing terms.
It requiresa large set of labeled data composed of previouslyindexed documents.
k-NN relies on the assumptionthat similar documents should be classified in asimilar way.
The algorithm consists of two steps:1/documents that are most ?similar?
to the querydocument must be retrieved from the set of labeleddocuments.
They are considered as ?neighbors?
forthe query document; 2/an indexing set must beproduced from these and assigned to the querydocument.Finding similar documentsAll documents are represented using a vector ofdistinctive features within the representation space.Based on this representation, labeled documents183may be ranked according to their similarity to thequery document using usual similarity measuressuch as cosine or Dice.
The challenge in this step isto define an appropriate representation space forthe documents and to select optimal features foreach document.
Another issue is the number (k) ofneighbors that should be selected to use in the nextstep.Producing an indexing setWhen applied to a single-class classification prob-lem, the class that is the most frequent among the kneighbors is usually assigned to the query docu-ment.
Indexing is a multi-class problem for whichthe number of classes a document should be as-signed is not known, as it may vary from onedocument to another.
Therefore, indexing termsfrom the neighbor documents are all taken intoaccount and ranked according to the number ofneighbors that were labeled with them.
The moreneighbors labeled with a given indexing term, thehigher the confidence that it will be a relevant in-dexing term for the query document.
This resultingindexing set may then be filtered to select only theterms that were obtained from a defined minimumnumber of neighbors.2.2 Document representationGeneric representationA generic representation of documents is obtainedfrom the text formed by the title and abstract.
Thistext is processed so that punctuation is removed,stop-words from a pre-defined list (of 310 words)are removed, remaining words are switched tolower case and a minimal amount of stemming isapplied.
As described by Salton (1989) wordsshould be weighted according to the number oftimes they occur in the query document and thenumber of times they occur in the whole collection(here, MEDLINE).
Moreover, words from the titleare given an additional weight compared to wordsfrom the abstract.
Further adjustments relative todocument length and local weighting according tothe Poisson distribution are detailed in (Aronson etal, 2000; Kim et al, 2001) where the PubMed Re-lated Citations (PRC) algorithm is discussed.
Fur-ther experiments showed that the best results wereobtained by using the ten nearest neighbors.Domain-specific representationIn specialized domains, documents from the litera-ture may be represented with concepts or objectscommonly used or studied in the field.
For exam-ple, (Rhodes et al, 2007) meet specific chemistryoriented search needs by representing US patentsand patent applications with molecular informationin the form of chemical terms and structures.
Asimilar representation is used for PubChem(http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) records.
In thegenetics domain, genes are among the most com-monly discussed or manipulated concepts.
There-fore, genes should provide a relevant domain-specific description of documents from the genet-ics literature.The second indexing algorithm that we describein this paper, know as the Gene Reference IntoFunction (GeneRIF) Related Citations (GRC) algo-rithm, uses ?GeneRIF?
links (defined in the para-graph below) to retrieve neighbors for a querydocument.To form a specific representation of the docu-ment, gene names are retrieved by ABGene1 (Ta-nabe and Wilbur, 2002) and mapped to EntrezGene2 unique identifiers.
The mapping was per-formed with a version of SemRep (Rindflesch andFiszman, 2003) restricted to human genes.
It con-sists in normalizing the gene name (switch to lowercase, remove spaces and hyphens) and matchingthe resulting string to one of the gene names oraliases listed in Entrez Gene.For each gene, the GeneRIF links supply a sub-set of MEDLINE citations manually selected byNLM indexers for describing the functions associ-ated with the gene.
These sets were used in twoways:To complete the document representation.
If acitation was included in the GeneRIF of agiven gene, the gene was given an additionalweight in the document representation.To limit the set of possible neighbors.
In thegeneric representation, all MEDLINE cita-tions contain the representation features,words.
Therefore, they all have to be con-sidered as potential neighbors.
However,1 Software downloaded January 17, 2007, fromhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/staff/lsmith/MedPost.html2 Retrieved January 17, 2007, from:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene184only a subset of citations actually containsgenes.
Therefore, only those citations needto be considered as potential neighbors.
Thisobservation enables us to limit the specificprocessing to relevant citations.
Possibleneighbors for a query document consist ofthe union of the GeneRIF citations corre-sponding to each gene in the document rep-resentation.Table 1: Gene description of a sample MEDLINEdocument and its two nearest neighborsPubMed IDs ABGene Entrez Gene IDs15645653 abcc6mrp6ldl-rpxefh368368; 62833949368; 5823227110835643 mrp6pxe368; 6283368; 582316392638 abcc6mrp6pxe368368; 6283368; 5823For each query document, the set of possibleneighbors was processed and ranked according togene similarity using a cosine measure.
Table 1shows the description of a sample MEDLINE cita-tion and its two nearest neighbors.Based on experiments with the PubMed RelatedCitations algorithm, ten neighbors were retained toform a candidate set of indexing terms.3 Experiment3.1 Application to MeSH indexingIn the MEDLINE database, publications of the bio-medical domain are indexed with Medical SubjectHeadings, or MeSH descriptors.
MeSH containsabout 24,000 main headings denoting medical con-cepts such as foot, bone neoplasm or appendec-tomy.
MeSH also contains 83 subheadings such asgenetics, metabolism or surgery that can be associ-ated with the main headings in order to refer to aspecific aspect of the concept.
Moreover, each de-scriptor (a main heading alone or associated withone or more subheadings) is assigned a ?minor?
or?major?
weight depending on how substantially theconcept it denotes is discussed in the article.
?Ma-jor?
descriptors are marked with a star.In order to form a candidate indexing set to beassigned to a query document, the descriptors as-signed to each of the neighbors were broken downinto a set of main headings and pairs (i.e.
a mainheading associated with a single subheading).
Forthis experiment, indications of major terms wereignored.For example, the MeSH descriptor*Myocardium/cytology/metabolism would gener-ate the main heading Myocardium and the twopairs Myocardium/cytology and Myocar-dium/metabolism.3.2 Test CorpusBoth methods were tested on a corpus composed ofa selection of the 49,863 citations entered intoMEDLINE in January 2005.
The 2006 version ofMeSH was used for the indexing in these citations.About one fifth of the citations (10,161) are con-sidered to be genetics-related, as determined byJournal Descriptor Indexing (Humphrey, 1999).Our test corpus was composed of genetics-relatedcitations from which Entrez Gene IDs could beextracted ?
about 40% of the cases.
The final testcorpus size was 3,962.
Appendix A shows a sam-ple citation from the corpus.3.3 ProtocolFigure 1 shows the setting of our experiment.Documents from the test corpus described abovewere processed to obtain both a generic and spe-cific representation as described in section 2.2.
Thecorresponding ten nearest neighbors were retrievedusing the PRC and GRC algorithms.
All theneighbors?
MeSH descriptors were pooled to formcandidate indexing sets of descriptors that wereevaluated using precision and recall measures.
Pre-cision was the number of candidate descriptors thatwere selected as indexing terms by NLM indexers(according to reference MEDLINE indexing) overthe total number of candidate descriptors.
Recallwas the number of candidate descriptors that wereselected as indexing terms by NLM indexers overthe total number of indexing terms expected (ac-cording to reference MEDLINE indexing).
Forbetter comparison between the methods, we alsocomputed F-measure giving equal weight to preci-185sion and recall - F1=2*PR/(P+R) and giving ahigher weight to recall - F3=10*PR/(9P+R).Four different categories of descriptors wereconsidered in the evaluation:MH: MeSH main headings (regardless ofwhether subheadings were attached in thereference indexing)SH: stand-alone subheadings (regardless of themain heading(s) they were attached to in thereference indexing)MH/SH: main heading/subheading pairsDESC: MeSH descriptors, i.e.
main headingsand main heading/subheading pairsSimilarly, four different candidate indexing setswere considered: the indexing set resulting fromPRC, the indexing set resulting from GRC, the in-dexing set resulting from the pooling of PRC andGRC sets and finally the indexing set resultingfrom the intersection of PRC and GRC indexingsets (common index terms).Figure 1: Producing candidate indexing sets withgeneric and domain-specific representations.4 ResultsAppendix B shows the indexing sets obtained fromthe GRC and PRC algorithms for a sample citationfrom the test corpus.
Table 2 presents the results ofour experiments.
For each category of descriptors,the best performance was bolded.
It can be ob-served that in general, the best precision and F1scores are obtained with the common indexing set,the best recall is obtained with the pooling of in-dexing sets and the best F3 score is obtained withPRC algorithm, the pooling of indexing sets beinga close second.5 Discussion5.1 Performance of the methodsAs can be seen from the bolded figures in table 2,the best performance is obtained either from thePRC algorithm, or from a combination of PRC andGRC.
When indexing methods are combined, it isusually expected that statistical methods will pro-vide the best recall whereas linguistic methods willprovide the best precision.
Combining complemen-tary methods is then expected to provide the bestoverall performance.
In this context, it seems thatthe option of pooling the indexing sets should beretained for further experiments.
The most signifi-cant result of this study is that the pooling of meth-ods achieves a recall of 92% for stand-alonesubheading retrieval.
While the precision is only19%, the selection of stand-alone subheadings of-fered by our methods is nearly exhaustive and itreduces by 70% the size of the list of allowablesubheadings that could potentially be used.
NLMindexers have declared this could prove very usefulto enhance their indexing practice.In order to qualify the added value of the spe-cific description, we looked at the descriptors thatwere correctly recommended by GRC and not rec-ommended by PRC.
Check Tags (descriptors usedto denote the species, age and gender of the sub-jects discussed in an article) seemed prominent, butonly Human was significantly recommended cor-rectly more often than it was recommended incor-rectly (~2.2 times more correct than incorrectrecommendations ?
2,712 correct vs. 1,250 incor-rect).
No other descriptor could be identified asbeing consistently recommended either correctly orincorrectly.GenericrepresentationText WordsSpecificrepresentationGenes1- Find similardocumentsMEDLINE documentPubMedRelated Citations(PRC)GeneRIFsRelated Citations(GRC)2- Use index termsin similardocuments asindexing candidatesPRCindexing setGRCindexing set186For both methods, filtering the indexing setsaccording to the number of neighbors that lead toinclude the indexing terms results in an increase ofprecision and a loss of recall.
The best trade-off(measured by F1) is obtained when indexing termscome from at least three neighbors (data notshown).5.2 A scale of indexing performanceThe problem with evaluating indexing is that,although inter-indexer variability is reduced whena controlled vocabulary is used, indexing is anopen cognitive task for which there is no unique?right?
solution.Table 2: performance of the indexing methods on the four categories of descriptorsSH MH SH/MH DESCP      R       F1     F3 P      R      F1      F3 P      R      F1      F3 P      R      F1      F3GRC 21     72     32     58 8      49     14      32 3      23     6        14 6      38     10      25PRC 27     88     41     72 13    61     22      45 8      56     15      36 11    59     18      41Pool 19     92     32     67 9      82     16      44 5      62     9        29 7      74     13     38Common 36     68     47     62 22    27     24      27 18    17     17      17 21    23     22      23In practice, this means that there is no idealunique set of descriptors to use for the indexingof a particular document.
Therefore, when com-paring an indexing set obtained automatically(e.g.
here with the PRC or GRC methods) to a?gold standard?
indexing set produced by atrained indexer (e.g.
here, NLM indexers) thedifference observed can be due to erroneous de-scriptors produced by the automatic methods.But it is also likely that the automatic methodswill produce terms that are semantically close towhat the human indexer selected or even rele-vant terms that the human indexer considered orforgot to select.
While evaluation methods toassess the semantic similarity between indexingsets are investigated (N?v?ol et al 2006), a con-sistency study by Funk et al (1983) can shadesome light on inter-indexer consistency inMEDLINE and what range of performance maybe expected from automatic systems.
In thisstudy, Hooper?s consistency (the average pro-portion of terms in agreement between two in-dexers) for stand-alone subheadings (SH) was48.7%.
It was 33.8% for pairs (MH/SH) and48.2% for main headings (MH).
In light of thesefigures, although no direct comparison with theresults of our experiment is possible, the preci-sion obtained from the common recommenda-tions (especially for stand-alone subheadings,36%) seems reasonably useful.
Further more,when informally presenting the indexers samplerecommendations obtained with these methods,they expressed their interest in the high recall asreviewing a larger selection of potentially usefulterms might help them track important descrip-tors they may not have thought of using other-wise.In comparison with other research, the resultsare also encouraging: the recall resulting fromeither PRC or pooling the indexing sets is sig-nificantly better than that obtained by N?v?ol etal.
(2007) on a larger set of MEDLINE 2005citations ?
20% at best for main head-ing/subheading pairs with a dictionary-basedmethod which consisted in extracting main head-ing and subheading separately from the citations(using MTI and string matching dictionary en-tries) before forming all the allowable pairs asrecommendations.5.3 Limitations of the experimentIn the specific description, the mapping betweengene names and Entrez Gene IDs only takes hu-man genes into account, which potentially limitsthe scope of the method, since many more or-ganisms and their genes may be discussed in theliterature.
In some cases, this limitation can leadto confusion with other organisms.
For example,the gene EPO ?erythropoietin?
is listed in EntrezGene for 11 organisms including Homo Sapiens.With our current algorithm, this gene will beassumed to be a human gene.
In the case ofPMID 15213094 in our test corpus, the organismdiscussed in the paper was in fact Mus Musculus(common mouse).
In this particular case, thecheck tag Humans, which was erroneous, couldbe found in the candidate indexing set.
However,187correct indexing terms could still be retrieveddue to the fact that both the human and mousegene share common functions.Another limitation is the size of the test cor-pus, which was limited to less than 4,000 docu-ments.5.4 Mining the biomedical literature forgene-concept linksOther approaches to gene-keyword mapping ex-ploit the links between genes and diseases orproteins as they are described either in the re-cords of databases such as OMIM or more for-mally expressed as in the GeneRIF.
Substantialwork has addressed linking DNA microarraydata to keywords in controlled vocabulary suchas MeSH (Masys et al 2001) or characterizinggene clusters with text words from the literature(Liu et al 2004).
However, no normalized ?se-mantic fingerprinting?
has been yet producedbetween controlled sets such as Entrez Gene andMeSH terms.6 Conclusion and future workIn this paper, we applied a statistical method forindexing documents from the genetics literature.We presented two different document represen-tations, one generic and one specific to the ge-netics domain.
The results bear out ourexpectations that such statistical methods canalso be used successfully to produce recommen-dations involving subheadings.
Furthermore,they yield higher recall than other more linguis-tic-based methods.
In terms of recall, the bestresults are obtained when the indexing sets fromboth the specific and generic representations arepooled.In future work, we plan to refine the algorithmbased on the specific method by expending itsscope to other organisms than Homo Sapiensand to take the gene frequency in the title andabstract of documents into account for the repre-sentation.
Then, we shall conduct further evalua-tions in order to observe the impact of thesechanges, and to verify that similar results can beobtained on a larger corpus.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported in part by an ap-pointment of A.

Recently, the ABCC6 (MRP6) gene wasfound to cause PXE.
A defective type of ABCC6 gene (16pl3.1) was determined in two Japanesepatients with PXE.
In order to determine whether these patients have a defect in ABCC6 gene, weexamined each of 31 exons and flanking intron sequences by PCR methods (SSCP screening anddirect sequencing).
We found two novel missense variants in exon 26 and 29 in a compound het-erozygous state in the first patient.
One is a missense mutation (c.3661C>T; p.R1221C) in exon 26and the other is a missense mutation (c.4069C>T; p.R1357W) in exon 29.
These mutations havenot been detected in our control panel of 200 alleles.
To our knowledge, this is the first report ofmutation identification in the ABCC6 gene in Japanese PXE patients.
The second patient was ho-mozygous for 2542_2543delG in ABCC6 gene and heterozygous for 6 kb deletion of LDL-R gene.This case is the first report of a genetically confirmed case of double mutations both in PXE andFH loci.MeSHreferenceindexing setAdultAgedFemaleHumansJapanMultidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics*Mutation, MissensePedigreePseudoxanthoma Elasticum/*genetics189Appendix B: Sample indexing sets obtained from the GRC and PRC algorithms fora sample citationPubMed ID 15645653GRC indexingset* (top 15 terms)Humans (10)Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins (9)Mutation (8)Male (7)Female (7)Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics (7)Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (6)Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum/genetics (6)Pedigree (5)Exons (4)DNA Mutational Analysis (4)Mutation/genetics (4)Adult (4)Introns (3)Aged (3)PRC indexingset* (top 15 terms)Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins (10)Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins /genetics (10)Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (10)Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum/genetics (10)Mutation (7)DNA Mutational Analysis (6)Pedigree (5)Genotype (4)Polymorphism, Genetic (4)Alleles (4)Mutation/genetics (3)Haplotypes (3)Models, Genetic (3)Gene Deletion (3)Exons (3)* Terms appearing in the reference set are underlined; the number of neighbors ?
