Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,page 1543, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Annotation Adaptation and Language Adaptation in NLPQun LiuCNGL Centre for Global Intelligent ContentNational Centre for Language TechnologySchool of ComputingDublin City UniversityDublin, Irelandqliu@computing.dcu.ieInvited Speaker AbstractAdaptation technologies are always useful in NLP when there is discrepancy between the training sce-nario and use scenario.
They are also effective in alleviating the data scarcity problem.
Domain adapta-tion is the most popular kind of adaptation technologies and is intensively researched.
In this talk we willintroduce two other kinds of adaptation technologies: annotation adaptation and language adaptation.Annotation adaptation is used to improve the performance of an automatic annotation task by leveragingcorpora with different annotation schemas, while language adaptation is used to solve an NLP problemin one language by utilizing the linguistic knowledge which is learnt from solving the same problemin another language.
We investigate these technologies mainly for the tasks of word segmentation andparsing, however similar technologies may be developed for other NLP tasks also.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
