Franceand IRISA Lannione-mail: bilanp~?rp.capsogeti.frABSTRACTThis paper presents a human-machine dia-logue model in the field of task-oriented dialogues.The originality of this model resides in the clearseparation of dialogue knowledge from task knowl-edge in order to facilitate for the modeling of di-alogue strategies and the maintenance of dialoguecoherence.
These two aspects are crucial in thefield of oral dialogues with a machine consider-ing the current state of the art in speech recogni-tion and understanding techniques.
One impor-tant theoretical innovation is that our dialoguemodel is based on a recent linguistic theory of di-alogue modeling.
The dialogue model considersreal-life situations, as our work was based on areal man-machine corpus of dialogues.In this paper we describe the model and the de-signed formalisms used in the implementation f adialogue manager module inside an oral dialoguesystem.
An important outcome and proof of ourmodel is that it is able to dialogue on three differ- ?ent applications.1 In t roduct ionThe work presented here is a dialogue model fororal task oriented dialogues.
This model is usedand under development in the SUNDIAL ESPRITproject I whose aim is to develop an oral coopera-tive dialogue system.Many researchers have observed that oral dia-logue is not merely organized as a cascade of ad-jacency pairs as Schlegoff and Sacks {1973} sug.gested.
Task oriented dialogues have been ana-lyzed from different point of view: discourse seg-mentation {Grosz & Sidner, 1986}, exchange seg-mentation with a triplet organization {Moeschler,19891, initiative in dialogue {Walker & Whittaker,1990}, etc.From a computational point of view, in task ori~?

Therefore,we developed a computational model able to haveclear views on happenings at the task level and atthe level of the communication itself.
This modelis not based on pure intuition but has been val-idated in a semi-automatic human-machine dia-logue simulation {Ponamal~ et al 1990).
The aimis to obtain a dialogue manager capable of naturalbehaviour during a conversation allowing the userto express himself and without being forced to re-spect the system behaviour.
Thus we endow thesystem with the capabilities of a fully interactivedialogue.Moreover, as a strategic hoice, we decided to havea predictive system, as it has been shown crucialfor oral dialogue system {Guyomard et al 1990;Young, 1989}, to guide the speech understandingmechanisms whenever possible.
These predictionsresult from an analysis of our corpus and gener-alized by endowing the system with the capacityto judge the degree of dialogue openness.
As aresults predicting the user's possible interventionsdoesn't mean that the system will predict all pos-sibilities - only relevant ones.
This presupposescooperative users.2 Overv iew of  the  D ia loguemanagerThe architecture of the SUNDIAL Dialogue Man-ager is presented in Fig.

Architecture of the Dialogue ManagerLet us briefly present how the dialogue man-ager works as a whole.
At each turn in the di-alogue, the dialogue module constructs dialogueallotvance8 on the basis of the current dialoguestructure.
Depending on whose turn it is to speak,these dialogue allowances provide either: dialogicdescriptions of the next possible system utteranceor dialogic predictions about the next possibleuser utterance(s).
When it is the system's turn,messages from the task module, such as requestsfor missing task parameters, message8 from thelinguistic interface module such as requests for therepetition of missing words, and messages from thebelief module arising, for example, from referentialfailure, are ordered and merged with the dialogueallowances by the dialogue module to produce thenext relevant system dialogue act(8) 2.
The result-Lug acts are then sent to message generator.When it is the user's turn to talk, task andbelief goals are ordered and merged with the di-alogue allowances to form predictions.
They aresent, via the linguistic interface module, to thelinguistic processor.
When the user speaks, a rep-resentation of the user's utterance is passed fromthe linguistic processor to the linguistic interfacemodule and then on to the belief module.
The be-lief module assigns it a context-dependent refer-ential interpretation suitable for the task moduleto make a task interpretation a d for the dialoguemodule to make a dialogic interpretation (e.g.
as-sign the correct dialogue act(s) and propagate theeffects on the dialogue history).
This results inthe construction of new dialogue allowances.
Thecycle is then repeated, to generate the next systemturn.This is necessarily a simplified overview of theprocessing which takes place inside the DialogueManager.
A detailed escription of the dialoguemanager can be found in (Bilange et al 1990a).The purpose of this paper is to describe some fun-aThis terminology is defined later.damental aspects of the dialogue module.
It ishowever important to state that the task moduleshould use planning techniques similar to Litman's(1984))3 Basis of the dialoguemodelTask oriented ialogues mainly consist of negoti-ations.
These negotiations are organized in twopossible patterns:1.
Negotiation opening + Reaction2.
Negotiation opening + Reaction + EvaluationMoreover negotiations may be detailed whichcauses ub-negotiations.
Also, in a full dialogue,conversational exchanges occur for clarifying com-munication problems, and for opening and closingthe dialogue.
This description is then recursivewith different possible dialogic functions.A dialogue model should take into accountthese phenomena keeping in mind the task thatmust be achieved.
An oral dialogue system shouldalso take into consideration acoustic problems dueto the limitation of the speech understanding tech-niques (soft-as well as hardware) e.g.
repairingtechniques to avoid misleading situations due tomisunderstandings should be provided.
Finally, asa cooperative principle, the model must be hab-itable and thus not rigid so that the two locutorscan take initiative whenever they want or need.These bases lead us to define a model whichconsists of four decision layers:s Rules of conversation,?
System dialogue act computation,o User dialogue act interpretation,?
Strategic decision level.Now let us describe ach layer.3.1  Rules  o f  conversat ionThe structural description of a dialogue consists offour levels similar to the linguistic model of Rouletand Moeschler (1989).
In each level specific func-tional aspects are assigned:s ~ransaction level : informative dialogues area collection of transactions.
In the domainof travel planning, transactions could be :book a one-way, a return, etc.
The trans-action level is then tied to the plan/sub-planparadigm.
A transaction can be viewed as adiscourse segment (Grosz & Sidner~ 1986).?
Ezchange level: transactions are achievedthrough exchanges which may be considered- 84 -Dialogue xcerpt of example in section 4$2 when would you like to leave 7U2 next thursdaySa next tuesday the 30th of November ;and at what time 7Us no, thursday december the 2ndtowards the end of the afternoonSt ok december the 2nd around six ...initiative(system, \[open_request, get_paranteter( dep.date)\])reaction(user, \[answer, \[dep_date : #1\]\])El \[ initiative( s#stem, \[echo, #1\])evaluation : E2 \] reaction(user, \[correct, \[#I, #2\]\])Tl L evaluation(system, \[echo, #2\ ] )initiative(system, \[open_request, get_parameter(dep_time)\])Ea reaction(user, \[answer, \[dep_time : #3\]\])e~aluation(s~ste,,~, \[echo, #$\])El : exchange(Owner: system, Intention: get(dep.date), Attention: {departure, date))E2 exchange(Owner: system, Intention: clarify(value(dep.date)), Attention: {departure, date))Ea exchange(Owner: system, Intention: get(dep_time), Attention: {departure, time))Tl = transaction(Intention:problem.description,Attention:(departure, a rival, city, date, time, flight))Figure 2.
Dialogue history representationas negotiations.
Exchanges may be embedded(sub-exchanges).
During an exchange, nego-tiations occur concerning task objects or thedialogue itself (meta-communication).Intervention level : An exchange is made upof interventions.
Three possible illocutionaxyfunctions axe attached to interventions: ini-tiative, reaction, and evaluation.Dialogue acts : A dialogue act could be de-fined as a speech act (Senile, 1975) augmentedwith structural effects on the dialogue (thuson the dialogue history) (Bunt, 1989).
Thereaxe one or more main dialogue acts in an in-tervention.
Possible secondary dialogue actsdenote the argumentation attached to themain ones.Dialogue acts represent he minimal entitiesof the conversation.The rules of conversation use this dialogue de-composition and axe organised as a dialogue gram-max.
Dialogue is then represented in a tree struc-ture to reflect he hieraxchica\] dialogue aspect aug-mented with dialogic functions.
An example isgiven in Fig.
2.
Now let us describe conversa-tional rules through a detailed description of thefunctional aspects of the intervention level.?
Initiatives axe often tied to task informa-tion requests, in task-oriented ialogues.
Initia-tives axe the first intervention of an exchange butmay be used to reintroduce a topic during an ex-change.
Intentional and attentional information isattached to initiatives and exchanges as in (Gross& Sidner, 1986).
When a locutor perforn'ts an ini-tiative the exchange is attributed to him, and heretains the initiative, since there is no need fordiscourse clarification, for the duration of the ex-change.
This is important as according to theanalysis of our corpus the owner of an exchangeis responsible for properly closing it and he hasmany possibilities to either keep the initiative orgive it back.The simplest initiative allowance rule initia-tive_taking, presented in Fig 3, means that thespeaker X who has just evaluated the exchangeSub-ezchange is allowed to open a new exchangesuch as it is a new sub-exchange of the exchangeEzchange ({_} means any well-formed sequenceaccording to the dialogue grammar).
Moreover,the new exchange can be used to enter a newtransaction.
In this case the newly created ex-change will not be linked as a sub-exchange (seesection 3.2 below).initiative.taking -->\[Exchange, {.
}, \[Sub-exchange, {_}, evaluation(X,_)\]\]dialogue (\[initiative (X,_),_\], Exchange).evaluation --->\[ Exchange, initiative(X,N), {_), reaction(Y,_) \]dialogue(evaluation (X,_), Exchange)<- not meta-diecursive(Exchange).Figure 3.
Two dialogue grammar ules.
Reactions obey the adjacency pair theory.Reactions always give relevant information to theinitiative answered.?
Evaluations, both by the machine and the hu-man, axe crucial.
To evaluate an exchange meansevaluating whether or not the underlying inten-tion is reached.
In task-oriented dialogues evalu-- ,~5  -ations may serve task evaluations or comprehen-sion evaluations in cases of speech degradations.An  example of an evaluation dialogue rule is givenin Fig 3.
The rule evaluation permits when Xhas initiated an exchange and Y reacted that Xevaluates this exchange.
The evaluation cannotbe made whilst there is no reaction taking place.This rule (as any other) is bidirectional : if X is in-stantiated by "user" then the generated ialogue'allowance' is a prediction of what the user canutter.
On the other hand, if X is instantiatedby "system" then the rule is one of a "strategicgeneration".
Evaluations are very important inoral conversation and coupled with the principleof bidirectional rules, this allows to foresee possi-ble user contentions and to handle them directlyas clarifying subexchanges.
The dialogue flavouris that the system implicitly offers initiative to theuser if necessary, keeping a cooperative attitude,and thus avoids systematic onfirmations whichcan be annoying (see example in section 4).The structural effects of evaluations are notnecessarily evident.
When an evaluation is ac-knowledged (with cue expressions like "yes", "ok ~or echoing what has been said) the exchange canbe closed in which case the exchange is explic-itly closed.
The acknowledgement may not havea concrete realization in which case the exchangeis implicitly closed.
In the latter case, closingsaxe effective when the next initiative is acceptedby the addressee.
It is unlikely, according to ourcorpus of dialogues, that one speaker will contestan evaluation later in the dialogue.
In the exam-ple in section 4, Sa initiative is accepted becauseU2 answers the question - the effect is then: U'sreaction implicitly accepts the initiative which im-plicitly accepts the S's evaluation.
Therefore, theexchange, concerning the destination and  arrivalcities, can be closed.
We will describe later howsuch effects are modelled.During one cycle, every possible dialogue al-lowance is generated even if some are conflicting.Conflicts are solved in the next two layers of themodel.3.2  D ia logue  acts  computat ionOnce the general perspective of the dialogue con-tinuation has been hypothesised, dialogue acts axeinstantiated according to task and communicationmanagement needs.
A dialogue act definition isdescribed in Fig 4.The premises state the list of messages thedialogue act copes with s. The conclusions axetwofold: there is a description of the dialogic ef-fect of the act and of its mental effect on the twoaWe recall that these messages are received by the di-alogue module internally (see section 3) or externally (seesection 2)Dialogue act label ==>message_l, .

We do not describe this last part asour model does no more than what exists in Allenetal's work (82 I. Lastly, the preconditions area list of tests concerning the current intentionaland attentional states in order to respect he dia-logue coherence and/or actions used for exampleto signal explicit topic shifts.
Signaling this meansintroducing features in order that once the act isto be generated some rhetorical cues are included:"Now let's talk about the return when do you wantto come back?
", or simply: aand at what time?
"when the discursive context states that the systemhas the initiative.At this level all possible dialogue acts accord-ing to the dialogue allowances issued by the previ-ous level axe hypothesised.
Discursive and meta-discursive acts are planned and the next layer willselect the relevant acts according to the dialoguestrategy.In the next paragraphs, we describe the most im-portant dialogue acts the system knows and clas-sify them according to the function they achieve.Combin ing  task  messages  and  d ia logue  al-lowances :The dialogue model considers the task as an in-dependent agent in a system.
The task modulesends relevant requests whenever it needs infor-mation, or information whenever asked by the di-alogue module.
* Initiatives and Parameter equests : an initia-tive can be used to ask for one task parameter.The intention of the new created exchange is thentagged as "get_parameter" whereas the attentionis the requested object 4.
The act is presented inFig.
5..
The other identified possibilities are initiativetThis is a very simplified description.
One can refer to(Sadek, 1990) to have a more precise view of what couldbe done.- 86  -and non topical information; initiative and tasksolution(n); trannaction opening, initiative, andtask plan opening; reaction and parameter value;transaction closing, evaluation and task plan clos-ing in which case the act may not have a surfacerealization since exchanges in the transaction mayhave been evaluated which implicitly allows thetransaction closing.Dia logue progression control :s Confirmation handling: Representations com-ing from the speech understanding module containrecognition scores s. According to the score rate,confirmations are generated with different inten-sity.
The rules are :s Low score : realize only the evaluation goalentering a clarifying exchange.
* Average score : a combination of evaluationand initiative is allowed, splitting them intotwo sentences as in "Paris Brest ; when wouldlike to leave ?"?
High score : in that case, the evaluation canbe merged with the next initiative as in "whenwould you like to leave for Bonn?".?
Contradiction handling.
When the addressee ut-ters a contradiction to an evaluation if any initia-tive has been uttered by the system, it is markedas "postponed".
The exchange in which the con-test occurs is then reentered and the evaluationpart becomes a sub-exchange.?
Communication management.
Requests forpauses or for repetition postpone every kind ofdialogue goal.
The adopted strategy is to achievethe phatic management and then reintroduce thegoals in the next system utterance.?
Reintroducing old goals.
As long ~ the currenttransaction is not closed the system tries to real-ize postponed goals if a dialogue opportunity (e.g.a dialogue allowance} arrives.
When realizing theopportunity a marker is used to reintroduce thecommunicative goal if it has been postponed for along time ("long time" refers to the length in thediscourse structure from the postponement andthe point where it is reintroduced).
This involvesthe tactical generation of using a special case ofrhetoric formulation.?
Abandoning previous goals.
The concrete real-ization of dropping an exchange occurs when goalshave been postponed and the transaction to whichthey belong is closed.
The justification is simple :a transaction close is submitted to the addresseefor evaluation.
If he does not contest this closingthen this implicitly allows the drop.Only non crucial exchanges are dropped.
If theySScores may be fuzzy.
They only represent the confusionrate which occurs during the lexicalization of the acousticsignal.were crucial to the transaction then they wouldn'thave been dropped.These communication management acts illus-trate the interest of our dialogue model and of-fer new means to cope with dialogue failure com-paring with recent techniques (Jullien & Marty,1989).3.3 D ia logue  s t ra tegy  mode l ingIn one running cycle, more than one dialogue actcan be a candidate, this is due to the nondeter-ministic nature of the dialogue which is preserveduntil this step.
For example, it is possible that thedialogue rules allow the system to take an initia-tive, evaluate an exchange, or react.
Consequentlya third layer of rules has been designed, in order toselect the best candidate according to a general di-alogue strategy.
As our system is dedicated to oraldialogues the strategy is firstly oriented toward asystematic confirmation of system's understand-ings and secondly, as a general strategy, we de-cided to avoid too many embedded subexchanges.This avoids numerous topic shifts, especially im-plicit ones.
The concrete realization of the latteris done by forcing the user to give explicit answersto problematic goals with utterances like "pleaseanswer yes or no ~.4 A dialogue exampleWe present here a dialogue example obtained withour system in the field of flight reservations 6.
Atpresent, there is no oral recognition system; user'sutterances are entered manually in predefined for-mat, including hypothesised acoustic scores andvoluntary misrecognition.$I  flight booking service, how can I help you?0"i one ticket to Brest, please$2 Paris, Brest, when would you like to leave7U2 next thursday$3 next tuesday the 30th of November ; and atwhat time?U3 no, thursday december the 2nd towards theend of the afternoon$4 ok december the 2nd around six ,~ just amoment  pleaseU4 thank you$5 there is one flight at six and another at ninethirtyUs nine thirty$6 ok nine thirty, Paris Brest, one-way or re-turn?U0 no I'd prefer six o'clock6Punctuation is here as oral transcription conventions.Therefore we suppressed some of them in user's utterancesas we are not able, at present, to deal with them.
Ques-tion marks mean that intonation rises and commas denotepauses.- 87  -57 ok, I'll book you on the six o'clock flight/\]7 fineSs one-way or return ?Us no, just one-way thanksNormally, the dialogue continues with the ac-quisition of the passenger name and address butnow this is not included in the task management.5 Conclus ionThe exposed model and system takes into ac-count previous works done in the field of dialoguemanagement augmenting them with a more sub-tle description of dialogues.
This allows us to re-spect our aims which were to obtain a generic dia-logue module adaptable to different applications,a model well suited to oral communication andlastly a model capable of handling dialogue fail-ures without any ad-hoc procedures.The system is currently under development inQuintus Prolog on a Sun Sparc Station.
We nowhave a first integrated small prototype which runsin three languages (English, French and German)and for three different applications: flight reser-vation, flight enquiries, and train timetable en-quiries.
This emphasizes the task independentand language independent aspects of the modelpresented here.
At present, we have about 20 dia-logue rules, 35 dialogue acts and limited strategymodeling.6 AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Jacques Siroux, Marc Guy-omaxd, Norman Fraser, Nigel Gilbert, Paul Heis-terkamp, Scott McGlashan, Jutta Unglaub, RobinWooffitt and Nick Youd for their discussion, com-ments and improvements on this research.7 ReferencesAllen, J.F., Frisch, A.M., Litman, D.J.
