PERSPECTIVES ONPARSING ISSUESChristopher K. RiesbeckYale UniversityCOMPUTATIONAL PEESPECTT VEIS IT USEFUL TO DISTINGUISH PARSING FROM INTERPRETATION?S ince  most  of th i s  pos i t ion  paper  v i i i  be a t tack ingthe  separat ion  of  pars ing  f rom in terpretat ion ,  le t  mef i r s t  make i t  c lear  that  I do be l ieve  in  syntact i cknowledge.
In  th i s  I am more conservat ive  than  o therresearchers  in  in terpretat ion  a t  Berke ley ,Carneg ie -Me l lon ,  Co lombia ,  the  un ivers i t ies  o fConnect icut  and Mary land ,  and Ya le .But be l iev ing  in  syntact i c  knowledge i s  not  the  sameas  be l iev ing  in  parsers !
The search  fo r  a way to ass ign8 syntact i c  s t ructure  to  a sentence  la rge ly  independento f  the  mean ing  o f  that  sentence  has led  to  a te r r ib lemisd i rec t ion  of  labor .
And th i s  e f fec t  has  been fe l t  onboth  s ides  of  the  fence .
We f ind  ourse lves  look ing  fo rways to  reduce  in teract ion  between syntax  and semant icsas  much as poss ib le .
How far  can  we dr ive  a pure lysyntact i c  ( semant ic )  ana lyzer ,  w i thout  sneak ing  over  in tothe enemy camp?
Row well can we disguise syntax(semantics) as semantics (syntax)?
How narrow a pipebetween the two can we set away with?
What a waste oftime, when we should be starting with bod ies  of texts,considering the total language analysis picture, andlooking for what kinds of knowledge need to interact tounders tand  those  texts .I f  our  in tent  in  overextend ins  our  theor ies  was tores t  the i r  musc le ,  then  I would  have no qua lms.
Push inga mechan ism down a b l ind  a l ley  i s  an impor tant  way tos tudy  i t s  weaknesses.
But I rea l ly  can ' t  accept  th i sPopper ian  v iew o f  modern computat iona l  l ingu is t i cs .Mechanisms are  not  d r iven  beyond the i r  l im i ts  to  f indthose  l im i ts ,  but  ra ther  to  grab  ter r i to ry  f rom the  o therside.
The underlying premise is "If our mechanism X cansometimes do task A, then there is no need for someonee lse 's  mechanism Y."
Occam's razor is used with murderousintent.Fur thermore ,  the  debate  over  whether  parsers  makesense  has  dras t i ca l ly  reduced in teract ion  betweenresearchers .
Each s ide  sees  the  o ther  as  avo id ingfundamenta l  i ssues ,  and so the  resu l ts  f rom the  o thers ide  a lways  seem to be bes ide  the  po in t .
For  example ,when Mirth Marcus" explains some grmamatical constraintas syntact i c  p rocess ing  const ra in ts ,  be doesn ' t  answerany of  the  prob lems I 'm faced  w i th .
And I 'm sure  Mi tchhas  no need fo r  f rame-based ,  domain -dr iven  par t ia ll anguage ana lys i s  techn iques .Th is  s i tuat ion  has  not  a r i sen  because  we have  beenfo rced  to  spec ia l i ze .
We s imply  don ' t  know enough toqua l i fy  fo r  an in format ion  exp los ion  yet .
Computat iona ll ingu is t i cs  doesn ' t  have  hundreds  of  journa ls  in  dozensof  languages .
I t ' s  a young f ie ld  w i th  on ly  a handfu l  o fpeop le  work ing  in  i t .Nor i s  i t  the  case  that  we don ' t  have th ings  to  sayto  each  o ther .
But - -  end here 's  the  rub  - -  some o f  themost  use fu l  th ings  that  each  o f  us knows are  the  th ingsthat  we don ' t  dare  te l l .
By that  I mean that  each  of  usknows where our  theor ies  fa l l  apar t ,  where ve have  tok ludge  the  programs,  fudge  the  inputs ,  o r  w ince  a t  theoutputs .
That  k ind  o f  in fo rmat ion  cou ld  be inva luab lefo r  suggest ing  to  the  o thers  where to  focus  the i ra t tent ions .
Unfor tunate ly ,  even i f  we became braveenough to ta lk  about ,  even emphas ize ,  where we ' re  hav ingprob lems,  the  odds are  low that  we would  cons ideracceptab le  what  someone e lse  proposes  as  a so lu t ion .IS SIMULATION OF HUMAN PROCESSING IMPORTANT?Yes, very much so, even if all you are interested inis a good computer program.
The reason why was neatlycaptured in ~rinciDles of Artificia~ lnte~lieence:" language has  evo lved  as a c~un icat ion  medium betweeni n te l l i aen~ be ings"  (N i l sson ,  p .
2 ) .
That  i s ,  natura llanguage usage  depends  on the  fac t  that  cer ta in  th ingscan  be le f t  ambiguous ,  le f t  vague,  o r  jus t  le f t  out ,because  the  hearer  knows a lmost  as  much as the  speaker .Natura l  language has  been f ine ly  tuned to  theco - , -un icat ive  needs  o f  human be ings .
We may have toadapt  to  the  l im i ta t ions  o f  our  ears  and our  voca lchords ,  but  we have o therwise  been the  masters  of  ourlanguage.
Th is  i s  t rue  even i f  there  i s  an innateun iversa l  grmmuar (wh ich  I don ' t  be l ieve  in ) .
Aun iversa l  grammar app l ies  few const ra in ts  to  our  use  o fe l l ips i s ,  ambigu i ty ,  anaphora ,  and a l l  the  o ther  aspectso f  language that  make language an e f f i c ient  means fo rin fo rmat ion  t rans fer ,  end a pa in  fo r  the  progr - - - -e r .Because  language has been f i t ted  to  what  we do best ,I be l ieve  i t ' s  improbab le  that  there  ex is t  p rocesses  veryun l ike  what peop le  use  to  dea l  w i th  i t .
There fore ,  wh i leI have  no in tent ion  o f  t ry ing  to  model  react ion  t ime datapo in ts ,  I do f ind  human behav ior  impor tant  fo r  two k indsof  in fo rmat ion .
F i r s t ,  what  do peop le  do we l l ,  how dothey  do i t ,  and how does  language use  depend on it?Second,  what  do peop le  do poor ly ,  and how does  languageuse  get  a round it?The quest ion  '~ow can we know what human process ingi s  rea l ly  l i ke?"
i s  a non- i ssue .
We don ' t  have to  knowwhat  human process ing  i s  rea l ly  l i ke .
But i f  peop le  canunders tand  texts  that  leave  out  c ruc ia l  background fac ts ,then  our  programs have to  be ab le  to  in fer  those  fac ts .I f  peop le  have  t roub le  unders tand ing  in format ion  phrasedin  cer ta in  ways ,  then  our  programs have to  phrase  i t  inways they  can  unders tand .
At some leve l  o f  descr ip t ion ,our  programs w i l l  have  to  be "do ing  what  peop le  do , "i .e .
,  f i l l i ng  in cer ta in  k inds  o f  b lanks ,  leav ing  outcer ta in  k inds  of  redundanc ies ,  and so on .
But there  i sno reason  fo r  computat iona l  l ingu is ts  to  wor ry  about  howdeep ly  the i r  p rograms cor respond to  human processes .WILL PARALLEL PROCESSING CHANGE THINGS?People have been predicting (and waiting for) greatbenefits from parallelism for some time.
Personally, Ibelieve that most of the benefits will come in the areaof  in terpretat ion ,  where la rge-sca le  memory search ,  suchas  Scot t  Fahlman has  been worry ing  about ,  a re  invo lved .And,  i f  anyth ing ,  improvements  in  the  use  o f  semant icsw i l l  decrease  the  a t t rac t iveness  o f  syntact i c  pars ing .But I a l so  th ink  that  there  are  not  that  many ga insto  be had from para l le l  p rocess ing .
Hash cod ings ,d i sc r iminat ion  t rees ,  and so on ,  a l ready  y ie ld  reasonab lyconstant  speeds  fo r  look ing  up data .
I t  i s  aninconven ience  to  have  to  dea l  w i th  such  th ings ,  but  notan insurmountab le  obstac le .
Our rea l  p rob lems at  themoment are  how to  get  our  sys tems to  make dec is ions ,  suchas  " I s  the  quest ion  "How many t imes  has  John asked  youfo r  money?"
rhetor i ca l  o r  not?"
We are  l im i ted  not  by thenumber of  p rocessors ,  but  by not  knowing how to do thejob.105TtI.~E LINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVEHAVE OUR TOOLS AFFECTED US?Yes,  and adverse ly .
To par t ia l l y  cont rad ic t  mys ta tements  in the  las t  paragraph,  we 've  been over lyconcerned w i th  how to do th ings  w i th  ex is t ing  hardwareand so f tware .
And we 've  been too impressed  by thesuccess  computer  sc ience  has  had w i th  syntax-dr ivencompi la t ion  of  p rogramming languages .
I1 i s  cer ta in lyt rue  that  work on grammars ,  parsers ,  code generators ,  andso on ,  have  changed compi le r  generat ion  f rom maes ivemul t i -man-year  endeavors  to  s tudent  course  pro jec ts .
I fcompi le r  techno logy  has  benef i ted  so much f rom syntact i cparsers ,  why can ' t  computat iona l  l ingu is t i cs?The prob lem here  is that  the  techno logy  has  not  donewhat  peop le  th ink  i t  has .
I t  has  a l lowed us to  deve lopmodern ,  we l l - s t ruc tured ,  task -or iented  languages ,  but  i thas  not  g iven  us natura l  ones .
Anyone who has  had coteach  an in t roductory  progru~ing  course  knows that .H igh- leve l  languages ,  though eas ie r  to l earn  than  mach inelanguage,  a re  very  d i f fe rent  f rom human languages ,  suchas English or Chinese.Programming languages ,  to  read jus t  N i l sson 's  quote ,a re  deve loped fo r  c~un icat ion  between morons .
A l l  theuseful features of language, such  as ellipsis andambigu i ty ,  have  to  be e l iminated  in  o rder  co use  thetechno logy  of  syntax-dr iven  pars ing .
Compi le rs  do notpoint the way for computational linguistics.
They showinstead what we get  if we restrict ourselves tosimplistic methods.DO WE PARSE CONTEXT-FREELY?My work ing  assumpt ion  i s  that  the  syntact i cknowledge used  in  comprehens ion  i s  a t  most  context - f reeand probab ly  a lo t  less ,  because  o f  memory l im i ta t ions .Th is  i s  most ly  a resu l t  o f  semant ic  heur i s t i cs  tak ingover  when const ruct ions  become too  complex  fo r  ourcogn i t ive  chunk ing  capac i t ies .
But th i s  i s  not  acritical assumpt ion  for me.
; ~rE~AC'~ ONSS ince  I don ' t  be l ieve  in  the  pure  gran~at ica lapproach ,  I have  to  rep lace  th i s  las t  set of  quest ionsw i th  quest ions  about  the  re la t ionsh ip  between ourknowledge ( l ingu is t i c  and o therwise)  and the  proceduresfo r  app ly ing  i1 .
For tunate ly ,  the  quest ions  s t i l l  makesense  a f te r  th i s  subst i tu t ion .DO OUR ALGORITHMS AFFECT OUR KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES?Of course .
In  fac t ,  i t  i s  o f ten  hard  to  dec idewhether  some feature  o f  a sys tem i s  a knowledge s t ructureor  a procedura l  fac tor .
For  example ,  i s  l inear  search  aresu l t  o f  data  s t ructures  or  p rocedure  des igns?CAN WE TEST ALGORITHMS/KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES SEPARATELY?We do indeed t ry  exper iments  based  on the  shape ofknowledge s t ructures ,  independent ly  o f  bow they  are  used(but  I th ink  that  most  such  exper iments  have  beeninconc lus ive) .
I 'm not  sure  what  i t  wou ld  mean,  however ,fo r  a procedure  to  be va l idated  independent ly  o f  theknowledge s t ructures  i t  works  w i th ,  s ince  unt i l  theknowledge s t ructures  were  r ight ,  you  cou ldn ' t  te l l  i f  theprocedure  was do ing  the  r ight  th ing  or  not .WHY DO WE SEPARATE RECOGNITION AND PRODUCTION?I f  I were t ry ing  to  dea l  w i th  th i s  quest io  n onEr ra t i ca l  g rounds ,  I wou ldn ' t  know what  i t  meant .Cr~ars  a re  not  p rocesses  and hence  have  no d i rec t ion .They are  abst ract  character i za t ions  o f  the  set  o fwe l l - fo rmed s t r ings .
From cer ta in  c lasses  o f  g ra -w-ars106one can mechan ica l ly  bu i ld  recogn izers  and rando~generators .
But such  mach ines  are  not  the  gra -~ars ,  anda recogn izer  i s  man i fes t ly  not  the  same mach ine  as agenerator ,  even though the  same grammar may under l ieboth.Suppose  ve rephrase  the  quest ion  as  '~hy  do we haveseparate  knowledge s t ructures  fo r  in terpretat ion  andproduct ion?"
Th is  p resupposes  that  there  are  separateknowledge s t ructures ,  and in  our  cur rent  systems th i s  ison ly  par t ia l l y  t rue .In terpret ing  and product ion  programs abound in adhoc procedures  that  share  very  l i t t le  in  common near  thelanguage end.
The in terpreters  a re  fu l l  o f  methods  fo rguessing at  mean ings ,  filling in the  b lanks ,  p red ic t ingl i ke ly  fo l low-ups ,  and  so on .
The generators  a re  fu l l  o fmethods  fo r  e l iminat ing  contextua l  i tems,  p ick ingappropr ia te  descr ip tors ,  choos ing  pronouns ,  and so on .Each has  a very  d i f fe rent  set  of  p rob lems to  dea l  w i th .On the  o ther  hand,  our  in terpreters  and generatorsdo share  what we th ink  i s  the  impor tant  s tu f f ,  the  wor ldknowledge,  w i thout  wh ich  a l l  the  o ther  process ingwou ldn ' t  be wor th  a par t r idge  in  a parse  t ree .
The wor ldknowledge says  what  makes sense  in  onders tand ins  and whati s  impor tant  to  ta lk  about .Par t  of  the  separat ion  of  in terpretat ion  andgenerat ion  occurs  when the  programs fo r  each  aredeve loped by d i f fe rent  peop le .
Th is  Tesu l ts  inunrea l i s t i c  sys tems that  wr i te  what  they  can ' t  read  andread  what they  can ' t  wr i te .
Someday we ' l l  have  a goodmodel o f  how knowledge the  in terpreter  ga ins  aboutunders tand ing  a new word i s  conver ted  to  knowledge thegenerator  can  use  to  va l id ly  p ick  that  word inproduct ion .
Th is  v i i i  have  account  fo r  how we canin terpret  words  w i thout  be ing  ready  to  use  them.For  example ,  f rom a sentence  l i ke  "The car  swervedo f f  the  road  and s t ruck  a br idge  abutment , "  we can  in ferthat  an abutment  i s  a noun descr ib ing  some k ind  o foutdoor  phys ica l  ob jec t ,  a t tachab le  to  a br idge .
Th iswould  be enough fo r  in terpretat ion ,  but  obv ious ly  thegenerator  w i l l  need co know more about  what  an abutmenti s  be fore  i t  cou ld  conf ident ly  say  "Oh,  look  a t  the  cuteabutment!
"A f ina l  po in t  on shar ing .
There  are  two s tandardarguments  fo r  shar ing  a t  leas t  g r=mmat ica l  in fo rmat ion .One i s  to  save  space ,  and the  o ther  i s  to  mainta incons is tency .
Wi thout  c la iming  that  shar ing  doesn ' toccur ,  I wou ld  l i ke  to  po in t  out  that  both  arguments  a revery  weak .
F i r s t ,  there  i s  rea l ly  not  a lo t  o fg rammat ica l  knowledge,  compared  aga ins t  a l l  the  o therknowledge we have  about  the  wor ld ,  so not  that  much spacewould  be saved i f  shar ing  occur red .
Second,  i f  thegenerator  der ives  i t ' s  l ingu is t i c  knowledge f rom theparser ' s  data  base ,  then  we ' l l  have  as  much cons is tencyas  we cou ld  measure  in  peop le  anyway.REFERENCENilsson, H. (1980).
