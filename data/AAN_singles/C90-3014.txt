A PhonologicalAbstractThis paper describes the framework of a Koreanphonological knowledge base system using the unification-based grammar formalism : Korean Phonology StructureGrammar (KPSG).
The approach of KPSG provides anexplicit development model for constructing a computationalphonological system : speech recognition and synthesis ystem.We show that the proposed approach is more describablethan other approaches uch as those employing a traditionalgenerative phonological approach.1, IntroductionKnowledge Base System Using Unification-based FormalismA Case Study of Korean PhonologyHee-Sung ChungKorea Academy of Industrial Technology(KAITECH)70-6, Yangjae-Dong, Seocho-Gu, S6oul Koreasyllable consists of all the segments that precede the neeleusand are tantosyllabic segments that follow the necleus.
Asyllable that has no coda is called "open syllable" : one witha coda is called "closed syllable".
According to the abovedefinitions of a syllable structure, the Korean syllable canbe described as follows :This paper has two main goals: one is to investigatethe phonological "knowledge base system for constructing aKorean speech recognition and synthesis system, the otheris to show that our formalism is more describable than othersystems employing the traditional phonological approaches\[I\]\[21.A language has its own sound patterns.
By sound pattenswe mean (1) set of sounds that occur is a language,(2) the permissible arrangement of the sounds in words and(3) the processing for adding, deleting, or changing sound\[3\].A speech recognition/synthesis ystem also needs aphonological knowledge base system (data base), and the ruleswhich govern the sound sequences and the phonologicalprocesses.Traditinoally, a computational phonological systems havebeen described and classified in terms of 'GenerativePhonology\[4\]', However most of those approaches are notsufficient to describe the various knowledge of acomputational speech system.In this paper, we show the feasibility of phonologicalknowledge base system with a uriification-based formalism,and illustrate the flexibility of implementation andrepresentation.

Korean Phonology Structure GrammarAs mentioned above, KLSG\[5\] is a new grammar theoryfor the Korean language and follows a unification-basedgrammar such as GPSG\[6\] and HPSG\[7\].
An outstandingcharacteristic of the KLSG, which has its descriptivecapability, can be described in syntatic and morphologicalknowledges as well as "knowledge of writting system,phonological and semantic knowledge with a unified grammartheory.
In this paper we are only concerned with thephonological structure of the Korean language.3-1.
The phonological feature system in KPSGAll the Korean phonological categories of KPSG arepresented by the sets of feature and they consist of featureand their values.
In the following, we briefly described thephonological feature structure of KPSG.2.
Syllable Structure of Korean LanguageA spoken language is not only a linear of soundsegments, but is a group of vowels and consonants to formlarge units of a sound such as syllables, words and utterance.In this section we present the nature and properties ofthe Korean phonetic structure : Korean syllable.
The Koreansyllable structure has two types: one is the type of consonantand vowel group(CV type : 71- : ga), and the other is thetype of consonant, vowel and consonant group(CVC type :7-1- : gak).
~\[he Korean language, however, has a predominantwriting system : HANGUL which is based on sound segmentsand syllables.
F_zpecially, a HANGUL syllable correspondsto one character which is a combination of two or threesound symbols.
In other words, a spoken syllable correspondsto a written syllable as a one-to-one fashion.Structurally, a syllable may be divided in to three parts :oneset, necleus and coda.
The most prominent part of aSYL(Syllable) <--- {Consonant-Onset,Vowel Consonant-Coda};This feature presents the consonant and vowel accordingto the articulatory properties of phoneme.PDF(Phoneme Distinctive Feature)<--- {Nasal, Voiced .... };This feature presents the practical phonetic values of theKorean language.FOLL(FOLIow) ; This feature can take a set ofcategories as its values : the value corresponds to a list ofcategories.3-2.
The Korean syllable structure ruleWe can de~ribe the Korean syllable struture of Fig 1using the value of FOLL features as follow :76 i(1-,1) open syllables -->Consonant-Onset + Vowel(1-2) closed syllabics .-->Consnnant.-Onset + Vowel + ConsonantoCc?la(1-l') \[SYL v ; FOL\[, { }\] -..>\[SYL e-o ; FOLI, { }\]\[SYL v ; FOLL {c-o}\].
(1-2') {SYL c-c ; FOLL { }1 ->\[SYL v ; FOLL { }\]\[SYL e-c ; FOLL {v}\].A careful look at the features specified in (1-1') and(1-2') will reveal that the ocurrences of the syllabic featureare predictable with the form of the rules; the syllabic featureappears on the set of feature similar to the left hand sideamong the right hand side in the rules.In the KPSG, we assume the syllable structure rule asthe general rule as follow :(1-3) M - -> C tI ,  MC HM' --> M \]-I M'/ .
j "M/"C HItwhere M and M' are the mother categories, C and Hare the daughter categories, in which C is the complementcategory, and tt is the head category, respectively.
Since(1-3) is a binary., tree, we u~ (1-1') to get a syllable structurefor (1-2').
its content is determined by the principles discussedlater.
The head in a rule plays the role of a primitive inthe knowledge processing of KPSG, and the feature of headis applied by the following principle,A.
Head Feature Principle(HFP)The values of the idivklual HEAD features of themother are indentical to the values of the HEAD featurescorn~'sponding to its head.This principle guarantees that the values of these headfeatures at the M(M') m?te and those at H no?It in the(1-3).
The general idea behind the formulations is to statecertain constraints regarding the head features, qhe headfeatures include SYL and PV.But tim HFP does not give necessary assignment of thevalues to the syllable's element.
The rules for the soundsequence and the phonological processes are handled byanother principle called subeat feature principle.B.
Subcat Feature Principle(SFP)'\[he value of the FOLL feature of a head is indcnticalto the FOLL feature of its naother except for the categorywhich is identical to its daughter.The sulx~lt feature principle states the rdationship thathol&; belween the FOLL vahte of the mothcr and that ofthe head in a given local phonology tree.C.
Binding Frature Principle(BFP)"\[\]fis principle states the distritmtion of binding featuresover a given syllabic tree.
A binding fealure is a featurewhose value is determined with respect to a category I~r~siblyseperatcd by a number of syllable boundaries.
"Ilfis featureplays a crucial role in describing the phonological process:vowel harmony and so on.~ihese principles are the constraints to select the adequatelocal syllabic tree among the inadequate local syllabic treesgenerated by the alxovc phonological rules: M ---> C H andM' ---> M H. The information of the basic feature valuesis prepared as the concrete phoneme entry, and is propagateda local tree to another local tree during the phonologicalprocessing, qtm operation which determines the structure cfffeature and the sets of feature is called unification.The feature system in phonological knowledge basesystem plays a role of the declarative feature knowledge andthe unification applied by the principles correspond to theprocedural knowdedge which specify the rules governing thesound sequence and phonological process.
From the viewpointof sound inventories, each rule is described deelaratively asa constraint condition which is ~ttled among the features.
"1tin equality and partiality among the feature are definedby the concept of unification.4.
Pratical examplesIn this section we illustrate how the phonological rulesin KPSG are operated.
The processes of sound change varyin the degree of naturalness.
The~.~.
are various type.s ofassimilations such as (1) nasalizal~0n, (2) palatalization,(3) assimilation and (4) vowel assimilation and ~ on.
Amongthose various types of assimilation, we investigate the mostcolnmon type of tim nasal assimilation in the Koreanlanguage.

\[+nasal\](1-4) is the formal descriptions of the phonological rulesbased on the theory of generative phonology.
The notationk - > / - - - \[+nasal\] is to be read as "k is re-writtenas if nasal phonetics is immediately to its fight".
~lhe~ rulescorrepond to the procedural knowledge of phonologicalprocess.
In comparison with this, unification based formalismis declarative knowledge representation.
For example,(1-5) \[SYL c-o ; FOLL { i ; PV a+/3  \]/ \{SYL c-e; FOLL {}; PDF nasal; PVa\]Ic~ \[SYL c-o; FOLL {SYL e-c; PDF nasal}: PVI3}\]I/3(1-5) presents the general rule form for na~l assimulationand here PVc~+/3means that phonetic values are composedaccording to the comtx.

Feature WorksAt present it is not clear just how to classify andintegrate all the knowledge we have accumulated about thenatural phonological processes into the grammars of individuallanguages.
We introduced a unification-based grammarformalism for phonology.
We verify that unification-basedgrammar formalism is a very useful theory for constructingthe computational speech processing system, similar to asyntactical system.In order to construct speech recognition and synthesissystem, we need a number of various knowledge sources :acoustic, phonetics, phonology, prosody, morphology, syntax,semantics, and pragmatics.
'Fhe problem is how to representand use those knowledges.
The knowledge representationmust keep the transparency among the knowledges with aunified way.
Unification-based grammar formalism satisfy theabove requirements.We also attemp to describe the English phonologicalknowledge base system with a unification-based formalism,and are implementing the Korean speech recognition /synthesissystem\[8\] with the KPSG.6.
