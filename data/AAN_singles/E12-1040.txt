Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, page 397,Avignon, France, April 23 - 27 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsLearning to Behave by ReadingRegina BarzilayComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence LaboratoryMassachusetts Institute of Technologyregina@csail.mit.eduAbstractIn this talk, I will address the problem of grounding linguistic analysis in control applications, suchas game playing and robot navigation.
We assume access to natural language documents that describethe desired behavior of a control algorithm (e.g., game strategy guides).
Our goal is to demonstratethat knowledge automatically extracted from such documents can dramatically improve performanceof the target application.
First, I will present a reinforcement learning algorithm for learning to mapnatural language instructions to executable actions.
This technique has enabled automation of tasksthat until now have required human participation ?
for example, automatically configuring softwareby consulting how-to guides.
Next, I will present a Monte-Carlo search algorithm for game playingthat incorporates information from game strategy guides.
In this framework, the task of text inter-pretation is formulated as a probabilistic model that is trained based on feedback from Monte-Carlosearch.
When applied to the Civilization strategy game, a language-empowered player outperformsits traditional counterpart by a significant margin.397
