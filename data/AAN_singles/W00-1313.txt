Chinae-mail: zyb, lesun, !du, yfsun@sonata.iscas.ac.cnAbstractThis paper proposed a new query translationmethod based on the mutual informationmatrices of terms in the Chinese andEnglish corpora.
Instead of looking up a?
bilingual phrase dictionary, thecompositional phrase (the translation ofphrase can be derived from the translationof its components) in the query can beindirectly translated via a general-purposeChinese-English dictionary look-upprocedure.
A novel selection method fortranslations of query terms is also presentedin detail.
Our query translation methodultimately constructs an English query inwhich each query term has a weight.
Theevaluation results show that the retrievalperformance achieved by our querytranslation method is about 73% ofmonolingual information retrieval and isabout 28% higher than that of simple word-by-word translation way.IntroductionWith the rapid growth of electronic documentsand the great development of network in China,there are more and more people touching theIntemet, on which, however, English is the mostpopular language being used.
It is difficult formost people in China to use English fluently, sothey would like to use Chinese to express theirqueries to retrieval the relevant Englishdocuments.
This situation motivates research inCross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).There are two approaches to CLIR, one isquery translation; the other is translatingoriginal language documents to destinationThis research was supported by the NationalScience Fund of China for Distinguished YoungScholars under contact 69983009.language quivalents.
Obviously, the latter is avery expensive task since there are so manydocuments in a collection and there is not yet areliable machine translation system that can beused to process automatically.
Most researchersare inclined to choose the query translationapproach \[Oard.
(1996)\].
Methods for querytranslation have focused on three areas: theemployment of machine translation techniques,dictionary based translation \[Hull &Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft (1996)\],parallel or comparable corpora for generatinga translation model \[Davis & Dunning (1995);Sheridan & Ballerini (1996); Nie, Jian-Yun eta1.(1999)\].
Machine translation (MT) methodhas many obstacles to prevent its employmentinto CLIR such as deep syntactic and semanticanalysis, user queries consisting of only one ortwo words, and an arduous task to build a MTsystem.
Dictionary based query translation is themost popular method because of its easiness toperform.
The main reasons leading to the greatdrops in CLIP,.
effectiveness by this method areambiguities caused by more than one translationof a query term and failures to translate phrasesduring query translation.
Previous studies \[Hull& Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros & Croft(1996)\] have shown that automatic word-by-word (WBW) query translation via machinereadable dictionary (MKD) results in a 40-60%loss in effectiveness below that of monolingualretrieval.
With regard to the use of parallelcorpora translation method, the critiques oneoften raises concern the availability of reliableparallel text corpora.
An alternative way is thatmaking use of the comparable corpora becausethey are easier to be obtained and there are moreand more bilingual even multilingual documentson the Internet.
From analyzing a documentcollection, an associated word list can beyielded and it is often used to expansion thequery in monolingual information retrieval \[Qiu& Frei(1993); Jing & Croft(1994)\].104In this paper, a new query translation ispresented by combination dictionary basedmethod with the comparable corpora analyzing.Ambiguity problem and phrase information lostare attacked in dictionary based Chinese-English Cross-Language information Retrieval(CECLIR).
The remainder of this paper isorganized as follows: section 1 gives a methodto calculate the mutual information matrices ofChinese-English comparable corpora.
Section 2develops a scheme to select the translations ofthe Chinese query terms and introduces how thecompositional phrase can be kept in our method.Section 3 presents a set of preliminaryexperiment on comparable corpora to evaluateour query translation method and gives someexplanations.1 .Mutual information matricescalculationWe hypothesize that the words in a sentenceafter being removed the stop words beassociated with each other and work together toexpress a query requirement.
The associationrelationship between two words can beindicated by their mutual information, whichcan be further used to discover phrases \[Church:& Hanks (1990)\].
If two words are independentwith each other, their mutual information wouldbe close to zero.
On the other hand, if they arestrongly related, the mutual information wouldbe much greater than zero and they would bemuch like to be a phrase; if they occurcomplementarily, the mutual information wouldbe negative.
In conclusion?
the bigger themutual information of word pair, the moreprobable the word phrase would be a phrase.According to \[Fano (1961)\], we can define themutual information M1 (tl,t z) of term t I andt z as formula (1).MI(q,t2) =log  z P(t~'t2) (1)P(t~)P(t2)WhereP(tl, t z) is the co-occurrence probability oft~ and t~ in a Chinese sentence.
The reason weselect a Chinese sentence to be a window otherthan a fixed length window is that a full Chinesesentence can keep more linguistic informationand consequently, it is more reasonable that wecan regard t~ and t 2 to be a phrase when theyco-occur in a sentence.
P(t l) and P(t 2) arethe occurrence probabilities of term t I and t 2in a sentence.
These probabilities can becalculated by the occurrence of term t~ and t 2in the collection as equation (2), (3) and (4).P(tl) = n,__~_ (2)NP(t2) = n,2 (3)NP(tl, t2 ) = n,,,,~ (4)NWherent~ , nt2 is the individual term frequency ofterm t I and t 2 respectively if either of themoccur in a sentence of the collection, ntt,t ~ isthe co-occurrence frequency of term t I and t 2i f  they are all in a sentence of the collection.
Nis the number of sentences of the collection.Replacing (1) with equation (2), (3) and (4), themutual information of term t I and t 2 can beexpressed by following formula.n,,.
NMI(q,t 2) = log 2 '- (5)H h nt 2Table 2 and table 3 show the occurrencefrequency values and mutual information valuescalculated by formula (5) for three Chinesecompositional phrases and their correspondingEnglish phrases respectively found in ourcomparable corpora.t 1 It 2 n,, n,2 n,,,,: MI~,\[-~l~f\]~ 106 84 45 9.28j~p l t~ 45 97 21 9.21~\ ]~\ [g~ 73 22 19 10.51Table 2: Mutual information of three Chinesephrases (N  = 123,000)tl I t2 nt~ ntz nt.t~ M1File I system 158 126 52 8.91User I management 59 112 18 8.97Graphic \[ interface 92 41 34 10.70Table 3: Mutual information of three Englishphrases (N  = 184,000)Anal)zing the Chinese-English comparablecorpora in this way, we can get two mutualinformation value matrices to indicate whichtwo terms (as to the Chinese collection, they are105almost Chinese words after segmentation)would be most possible to be a phrase.
A wordlist associated to each Chinese query term canbe obtained by looking up the mutualinformation value matrix of the Chinese corpuswith a cutoff of M1 =1.50.
As discussedabove, the bigger the mutual information valuebetween two terms, the more possible the twowords would be a phrase.
We can infer that theassociated word list of the query term containsthe terms that are the most possible componentsof a compositional phrase.
In other words, thephrase information can be kept by this way.
TheChinese query is translated into English vialooking up the English senses of Chinese queryterm and words in its associated word list in aChinese-English dictionary.
The procedureshow to select appropriate tranlations and toconstruct he English query are discussed insection 2.2 Translations selection and phrasekeepingIt is a naive method to translate a Chinese queryonly by looking up each Chinese term to get itsEnglish senses in a Chinese-English dictionary.This method, however, results in too manyambiguities during the query translation andoffers no path to select appropriate ones amongthe translations.
In addition, phrases in the querycan not be translated effectively.
Previous tudyhas showed that failure to translate phrasesgreatly reduces the performance by up to 25%over automatic word-by-word (WBW) querytranslation \[Ballesteros & Croft (1996)\].In our method, those English translationsmost likely co-occur with each other can beobtained via looking up the mutual informationvalue matrix of the English corpus with a cutoffM1 = 1.50.
In this way, the English senses ofterms in the associated word list can provide agood context for the translation of the Chinesequery term and give a significant clue for itstranslations selection.
In addition, theinformation of two terms (either Chinese orEnglish) to be a phrase can also be stored in theassociated word list.
In the following, we firstlydescribe our method to select translations indetail, and then we give an example todemonstrate how to keep the phrase informationin our method.Supposing the Chinese query is expressed by(e 1 ,e~ ,.--, e, ).
el, e2,... , e, are the segmentedChinese words of the query after removing thestop words.
The translations ofe m (m = 1,...,r)by looking up the Chinese-English bilingual dictionary can be ordered indescending by following formula.W(fm t ) = lOglO(Ot'i_Ml(f ~)+ fl "o_Ml(fm t )) (6)l~'llgmkl" t " "z zi _M i ( fm l ) = k=l j= l  /I~llrmkl (7)k=lr \]~1 lZ ZMI(f,~,J~ k)o_ MI(fm l ) = i=l,i?m k=l (8)r  lYd?
i=l,i~mWheref~ is one sense of the English translation setF m of the word e,~ (l = 1,...,IF.b g. is theassociation word set of e m .
The size of E m isle.I and its element is e~ (k = 1 .... ,le.I)F~ is the English translation set of emk, itselement is f,,~.
ct is the coefficient toemphasize the inner mutual informationbetween the English sense f t of the singleChinese query term e m and the English sensef ,~ of the e m's association word emk.
Thefirst part of the formula (6) i _M I ( f~)reflects the probability of English translationf,~ and f ,~ to be a phrase.
/3 is thecoefficient o emphasize the outside mutualinformation between f,~ and the English sense~* of the other Chinese terms included in thequery.
The second part of the formula (6)o_  Ml ( f~)  reflects the relevant value betweenthe English sense f ,~of  e m and the wholequery concept.Our method of translations selection can bedescribed as follows: if the weight of anytranslation of the Chinese query term is greaterthan 1.00, the sense is selected to construct theEnglish query.
If there is no weight of anytranslation of the Chinese query term greaterthan 1.00, the sense with biggest one is selectedto construct the English query.
In this way, wecan make an English query by the followingBoolean expression.106r / I F~I .
t "~ Query =21\[ XI ~glra'W(gra))) (9)Where o I is set element after the English Oratranslation sense set F m which is detruncatedby our translation selection method.In order to demonstrate he procedure of ourmethod, we give an example and explain howthe English translations are selected and how thephrase information is kept.
Given a simpleChinese query " ~ fi' , '~ ~ , ~ ~ (user,management, command)" after segmentationand removing stop words, the associated wordlist of term " ~ ~ (user)" is " '~" 2~(management) , 4-~ ,~ (information) , --f- ~"(manual)" and the associated word list of term"'~ ~E(management)" is "~ ~ (user), *J~(harrddisk), ~,Aq-(file)".
We process the associatedword "'~2~2(management)" of the query term"~q ~ (user)" in a special way by adding anappropriate value to their mutual informationvalue to let theirs be the biggest in theassociated word list, because the associatedword " '~(management)"  also occurs in theoriginal query.
Similar way is done with theassociated word "~ ~ (user)" of the query term"~ ~ (management)".
In this way, , thecompositional phrase " h~ ~ '~ JX (usermanagement)" can be kept in both associatedword list of term " I t / "  (user)" and term "~X(management)".When term ")~ ~"  is translated into Englishby looking up the general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual dictionary, we get its Englishsense set "user, consumer" ordered by theformula (6).
When term "~'JE" is translatedinto English, we get its English sense set"management, administration, supervision, run"ordered by the formula (6).
We can fred the firstpositions of the English translation set of thequery term "~ P"  and term '"~'JX" are "user"and "management" respectively.
From the pointof view of translation, the phrase "usermanagement" can be regarded as the Englishphrase translation of "~ # '~ ~" .
According toour translation selection and formula (9), we canconstruct the English Boolean query as follows,in which each query term has a weight.Query = (user, 1.86)and ((management, 1.83)or (administration, 1.63)) and (command, 1.92).3 Evaluation and discussionTo evaluate our query translation method, wedid a set of experiment to compare it to theword-by-word (WBW) translation method andmanual translation method.
In the word-by-word translation method, the Chinese queriesare automatically segmented and the Chineseterms included in them are translated intoEnglish only by looking up the general-purposeChinese-English bilingual dictionary.
In themanual translation method, the Chinese queriesare translated into English by a Ph.D. student.The segmentation we used is based on a smallgeneral-purpose Chinese-English bilingualdictionary that only contains 46,570 pairs inwhich each Chinese word has several Englishtranslations.
The forward and backwardmaximum matching algorithm is used tosegment he texts and find the combinatorialambiguities.
Of all the combinatorialambiguities, 91.2% are removed with the worduni-gram prior probabilities.
A stop word list of1210 elements is set up, which containsfrequently used functional words as well assymbols \[Du & Sun (2000)\].
Our Chinese querytranslation process contains following steps:(1) Segment the Chinese query according to themethod introduced above.
(2) Get the associated word list of each Chineseterm included in the query from the Chinesemutual information matrix.
(3) Look up the English sense set of eachChinese term and its associated word in thegeneral-purpose Chinese-English bilingualdictionary.
(4) Select the English translation sense by themethod introduced in section 2 (in formula(6) the coefficents tx and fl are selectedby 1.0 and 0.5 respectively in ourexperiment) and construct the English queryon the basis of the formula (9).The document collection used in ourexperiments consists of several Chinese andcorresponding English computer manuals,which include Linux-HOWTO, PostgreSQLhandbook, Mysql handbook, Linux kernel* andLinux Gazette 17 volumes (from July, 1998 toDec., 1999)".
In order get a large numberdocument Chinese and English collections, wedecomposed these manuals and let everydocument no more than 15 sentences.
As a* http://www.linux forum.nct/books/index.html* *http://www.linuxgazette.com.cn107result, Chinese-English bilingual comparablecorpora are obtained in which contain about8,200 Chinese documents and 12,500 Englishdocuments.
We design 13 Chinese queries, theaverage length is about 7 single Chinesecharacter (about hree Chinese words).
All workin this study was performed on the Search2000information retrieval system \[Du & Zhang(2000)\], which can process both Chinese andEnglish Boolean queries.Table 4 shows the precision and recall table forthe three methods.
The first column in table 4contains precision values averaged 13 queries andinterpolated to eleven recall points from 0.0 to 1.0in steps of 0.1.
The third column containsprecision values achieved by our translationmethod (QT).Precision Precision PrecisionRecall (WBW) (Manual) (QT)at 0.00at 0.10at 0.20at 0.30at 0.40at 0.50at 0.60at 0.70at 0.80at 0.90at 1.00Avg.0.5831 0.8975 0.66420.5132 0.7884 0.58250.4036 0.6573 0.51740.3771 0.6206 0.47280.3128 0.5840 0.41630.2816 0.5118 0.38380.2143 0.4876 0.31040.1641 0.3833 0.26450.1110 0.2114 0.17020.0741 0.1667 0.10200.0212 0.0428 0.03420.2778 0.4865 0.3562Table 4: The results of the three methodsThe results in table 4 suggest that in this case,the WBW query translation leads to a great dropin effectiveness of 42.90% below that formonolingual retrieval (manual translationmethod).
The result of our query translationmethod greatly improves effectiveness by28.22% over the WBW method, and itseffectiveness is about 73.21% of that formonolingual retrieval.
Although phrasetranslation is not executed directly in ourmethod, the phrase information is kepteffectively in the associated word list.
Therefore,the phrase can be well ~anslated.
The associatedword list also provides a good context fortranslation of the Chinese query terms(corresponding to the first part of formula (6)i _Ml ( f~t) )  and a good English translation isgiven a relatively high weight.
The results intable 4 show that our query translation methodcan construct a good English query and indeedimprove the effectiveness.ConclusionAutomatic word-by-word query translation is anattractive method because it is easy to perform,resources are readily available, and performanceis similar to that of other CLIP,.
methods.However, there are a lot of ambiguities intranslation of the query terms and failures totranslate phrases correctly, which are mainlyresponsible for the large drops in effectivenessbelow monolingual retrieval performance.Aiming to tackle with these problems, wedevelop a new scheme for how to selecttranslations in this paper.
In addition, rather thanusing a bilingual phrase dictionary, we also putforward a new method to translate phrasesindirectly by using the mutual informationbetween two words in a full sentence and keepthe phrase information in the associated wordlist effectively.
As a result of our querytranslation method, an English query isconstructed in which each query term has aweight.In this study, our method leads to improvethe effectiveness by 28.22% over the word byword query translation method, but is still about27% below the monolingual retrievalperformance.
If query expansion is employed inour method, we expect he performance shouldbe further improved.
A shortcoming of ourmethod is that the cost of calculation of themutual information matrices is very large.
Weare currently exploring an algorithm to generatethe matrices more efficiently and the selectionof coefficients in formula (6) also needs furtherresearch.AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to express their appreciation tothose interpreters of computer manuals.
