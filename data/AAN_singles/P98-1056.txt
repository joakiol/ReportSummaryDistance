ieAbst ractWe present wo approaches for syntactic and se-mantic transfer based on LFG f-structures andcompare the results with existing co-descriptionand restriction operator based approaches, fo-cusing on aspects of ambiguity preserving trans-fer, complex cases of syntactic structural mis-matches as well as on modularity and reusabil-ity.
The two transfer approaches are interfacedwith an existing, implemented transfer com-ponent (Verbmobi1), by translating f-structuresinto a term language, and by interfacing f-structure representations with an existing se-mantic based transfer approach, respectively.1 In t roduct ionTarget and source levels of representation itransfer-based machine translation (MT) aresubject o often competing demands: on the onehand, they need to abstract away from partic-ulars of language specific surface realization toensure that transfer is as simple and straightfor-ward as possible.
On the other hand, they needto encode sufficiently fine-grained information tosteer transfer.
Furthermore, target and sourcerepresentations should be linguistically well es-tablished and motivated levels of representa-tion.
Finally, from a computational perspectivethey need to be sensible representations forbothparsing and generation.
LFG f-structures areabstract, "high-level" syntactic representationswhich go some way towards meeting these of-ten irreconcilable r quirements."
We would like to thank H. Kamp, M. Schiehlen andthe anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on ear-lier versions of this article.
Part of this work was fundedby the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science,Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework ofthe Verbmobil project under grant 01 IV 701 N3.Correspondence-based transfer on f-structureshas been proposed in (Kaplan et al, 1989).A closer look at translation problems involv-ing structural mismatches between languages -in particular head switching phenomena (Sadlerand Thompson, 1991) - led to the contentionthat transfer is facilitated at the level of seman-tic representation, where structural differencesbetween languages are often neutralized.
Struc-tural misalignment is treated in semantics con-struction involving a restriction operator (Ka-plan and Wedekind, 1993) where f-structures arerelated to (possibly sets of) disambiguated se-mantic representations.Given the high potential of semantic ambigui-ties, the advantage of defining transfer on se-mantic representations could well be counter-balanced by the overhead generated by multi-ple disambiguated structures as input to trans-fer.
This and the observation that many seman-tic (and syntactic) ambiguities can be preservedwhen translating into a target language that isambiguous in similar ways, sheds light on theissue of the properties of representations for thetask of defining transfer.In principle, the problem of semantic ambi-guity in transfer can be tackled in a numberof ways.
Packed ambiguity representation tech-niques (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993) could beintegrated with the approach in (Kaplan andWedekind, 1993).
In the linear logic based se-mantics of (Dalrymple t al., 1996) scope am-biguities are accounted for in terms of alterna-tive derivations of meaning assignments froma set of meaning constructors.
Ambiguity pre-serving semantic transfer can be devised onsets of meaning constructors rather than dis-ambiguated meanings (Genabith et al, 1998).Transfer on packed representations is considered341in (Emele and Dorna, 1998).In the present paper we consider alternative ap-proaches to transfer on underspecified - syntac-tic or semantic - representations, focusing on is-sues of modularity, reusability and practicality,interfacing existing implemented approaches ina flexible way.
At the same time, the propos-als readdress the issue of what is an appropriatelevel of representation fortranslation, in view ofthe known problems engendered by structuralmismatches and semantic ambiguity.We first show how the underlying machineryof the semantic-based transfer approach de-veloped in Dorna and Emele (1996b) can beported to syntactic f-structure representations.Second, we show how the underspecified seman-tic interpretation approach developed in Gen-abith and Crouch (1997) can be exploited to in-terface f-structure representations directly withthe named semantic-based transfer approach.Third, we compare the two approaches witheach other, and with co-description and restric-tion operator based approaches.2 Syntact i c  T rans ferThis section presents a simple bidirectionaltranslation between LFG f-structures and termrepresentations which serve as input to andoutput of a transfer component developedwithin the Verbmobil project (Dorna and Emele,1996a).
The term representation is inspired byearlier work (Kay et al, 1994; Caspari andSchmid, 1994) which uses terms as a quasi-semantic representation for transfer and gener-ation.The translation between f-structures and termsis based on the correspondence between directedgraphs representing f-structures and the func-tional interpretation of these graphs (cf.
(John-son, 1991)).
Given an arc labeled f which con-nects two nodes nl and n2 in a graph, the samecan be expressed by a function f (n l )  = n2.
Anf-structure is the set of such feature equationsdescribing the associated graph.
Instead of fea-ture equations f (n l )  -- n2 we use the relationalnotation f (n l ,  n2).Using this idea f-structures can be convertedinto sets of terms and vice versa} F-structure1For motivation why we prefer term representationsPRED features and their "semantic form" valuesare given special treatment.
Instead of introduc-ing PRED terms we build unary relations withthe semantic form predicate name as functor(see Example (1)).
The resulting representationis similar to a Neo-Davidsonian style event se-mantics (Parsons, 1991) but uses syntactic roles.For a formalization of the f-structure-term cor-respondence s e Appendix A.l (I) a.

{ kochen(nl),SUBJ (nl ,n2), Hans (n2),ADJN(nl,n3), gerne(n3) }Consider the simple head switching example in-volving the German attitude adverb gerne andthe English verb like (see (lb) and (3b)).
(la)is the LFG f-structure for the German sen-tence (lb).
2 (lc) is the set of terms representing(la).Transfer works on source language (SL) and tar-get language (TL) sets of terms representingpredicates, roles, etc.
like the ones shown in (lc).The mapping is encoded in transfer ules as in(2).
For a rule to be applied, the set on the SLside must be a matching subset of the SL inputset.
If this is the case, we remove the coveringset from the input and add the set on the otherside of the rule to the TL output.
Transfer iscomplete, if the SL set is empty.

Up-per case letters in argument positions are logicalvariables which will be bound to nodes at run-time.
Because of the variable sharings on bothsides of a rule we work on the same nodes of agraph.
The result is a graph rewriting process.over feature structures for transfer, see (Emele andDorna, 1998).2For presentational purposes we leave out morpho-syntactic information in f-structures here and in the fol-lowing examples.342The head switching rule (2d) shows two compo-nents on its lefthand side: the part to the rightof # is a test on a copy of the original input.
Thetest binds the variable Y at runtime when ap-plying the rule from left to right.
In the reversedirection (and in general), TL tests are ignored.Applying the rule set in (2) to (lc), we get(3c).
We now use the correspondence b tween f-structures and term representations to constructthe TL f-structure.
The result is (3a) represent-ing the English sentence (3b).

The representations (Bos etal., 1996) are UDRS variants (Reyle, 1993).F-structures are abstract syntactic representa-tions.
They do, however, encode basic predicate-argument relations, and this is essentially se-mantic information.
It turns out that thereare important structural similarities betweenf-structures and UDRSs: f-structures can be"read" as UDRSs and hence be assigned anunderspecified truth-conditional interpretation(Genabith and Crouch, 1997).
3 Appendix Bgives a relational formulation of the corre-spondence between f-structures and UDRSs.The UDRS representations are processed bysemantic-based transfer.
The resulting system isbi-directional.
Consider again the simple headswitching case discussed in (1) and (3) above.
(4) shows the corresponding UDRSs.The structural mismatch between the two f-structures has disappeared on the level of UDRSrepresentations and transfer is facilitated.
43A similar corespondence between f-structures andQLFs (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) has been shown in(Genabith and Crouch, 1996).4In the implementation, a Neo-Davidsonian style en-(4)z, "?Hans(x~\]) \]?

Dueto space limits we will not discuss straightfor-ward cases where ambiguites represented in un-derspecified representations are carried over intothe target language.
Examples of this type in-volve quantificational nd plural NPs, negation,or adjunct sets.
Instead, we concentrate on com-plex cases where a source language ambiguityneeds to be resolved in target language.4.1 Embedded Head-Swi tch ingThe syntactic transfer rules (2) are supple-mented by (5).
The complex rule for gerne in(5) overrides 5 (2d) and the COMP rule in (5).
Foreach additional level of embedding triggered byhead switching adjuncts a special rule is needed.

{ gerne(X),ADJN(E,X),COMP(E1,E) } #(SUBJ(E,Y) } <->{ like(X),XCOMP(X,E),SUBJ(X,Y),COMP(EI,X) }.By contrast, on the level of UDRSs head switch-ing has disappeared and transfer is facilitated.Figure 1 shows the transfer correspondence b -tween terms and UDRSs.coding of predicate argument relations is used.
The sub-ject of the target l ike relation is determined by the fol-lowing transfer ule:{ L:gerne(L1) } # { L2 ~ L1, L2:agent(A) }<-> { L:like(A,L1) }._~ is the transitive closure over subordination con-straints <.
Here and in the following we do not give setrepresentations of UDRSs and transfer ules.
Instead, weprovide a graphical representations of standard UDRSsto better illustrate the structural mismatches discussion.5For the treatment of overriding see, e.g., the speci-ficity criterion in (Dorna and Emele, 1996a).343I zN, z?

For syntactictransfer, adding rules (9) to the ones introducedin (2) leads to (8a).

(8a) corresponds to only one of the En-glish translations, namely (6d), of (6a).
Asin the correspondence-based approach (Ha-plan et al, 1989), often can only be assignedwide scope over like if the transfer formal-ism allows reference to and rewriting of par-tial nodes.
In the present case the two termskochen(nl).
SUBJ(nl,n2) could then be rewrit-ten as the complement of like, XCOMP(n4,nl),whereas  ADJN(nl,n3) is rewritten as ADJN(n4,n3)or hDJN(nl ,n3).6The target f-structure for English must resolvethe relative scope between like and often ((8b)and (10)).

?k(xm) IHowever, (11) is not in the direct f-structure -UDRS correspondence with (10) and (Sb).
In-stead, the correspondences on the enumerationsof the scoping possibilities of (11) yield (10) and(8b) as required.By contrast, the reading of (6b) is restricted bythe surface order in which the two adverbialsoccur.
On the semantic level this is reflectedin terms of corresponding subordination con-straints (12).
The target UDRS corresponds tof-structure (Sb).OAs an alternative, we can get both readings ifwe define special rules for adverbials in head switch-ing contexts, giving them wide or narrow scope rel-ative to the head switching adverbial.
A narrowscope rule is already given in (9).
A wide scoperule would be {hDJN(E,X)} # {HS(E1), XC0~IP(E1,E)}~-} {ADJN(EI,X)} where HS(E1) is a "marker" on theswitched adverbial's node El.

Similarly, in syntactic transfer,the precedence constraint (13) can be used tosteer translation to f-structure (8b).5 D iscuss ionWe have presented two alternative architecturesfor transfer in LFG.
In both cases, transfer isdriven by the transfer module developed andimplemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a).
Inthe case of syntactic transfer, transfer is de-fined on term representations of f-structures.
Inthe case of semantic transfer, transfer is de-fined on UDRS translations of f-structures.
F-structure, term and UDRS correspondences aredefined in the Appendix.
The transfer ules arebi-directional, as are the f-structure-term andf-structure-UDRS correspondences.Co-description based approaches (Kaplan andWedekind, 1993) require annotation of sourceand target lexica and grammars.
By contrast,both approaches presented here support mod-ular grammar development: hey don't involveadditional coding in the grammar specifications.An important issue, noted above, is the problemof ambiguities and ambiguity preserving trans-fer.
F-structures and UDRSs are underspecifiedsyntactic and semantic representations, respec-tively.
Both support ambiguity preserving trans-fer to differing degrees (NP scope, operators,adjuncts).
F-structure based syntactic represen-345tations may come up against structural mis-matches in transfer.
The original co-descriptionbased approach in (Kaplan et al, 1989) facedproblems when it came to examples involvingembedded head-switching and multiple adjuncts(Sadler and Thompson, 1991), which led to theintroduction of a restriction operator, to en-able transfer on partial f-structures or semanticstructures (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993).
Onemight suppose that the need to refer to partialstructures i an artifact of the correspondence-based approach, which doesn't allow the map-ping from a single node of the source f-structureto distinct nodes in the target f-structure with-out violation of the functional property of thecorrespondence.
On closer inspection, though,the rewriting approach to syntactic f-structure-term translations presented above suffers fromthe very same problems that were met by thecorrespondence-based approach in (Kaplan etal., 1989).By contrast, transfer on the semantic UDRSrepresentations does not suffer from such prob-lems.
Head switching is dealt with in the con-struction of semantic representations.
Under-specified semantic representations i  the form ofUDRSs (or related formalisms) offer the follow-ing advantanges for transfer: they abstract awayfrom cross-language configurational variation tofacilitate transfer.
Unlike the original restric-tion operator approach (Kaplan and Wedekind,1993) whenever possible they avoid the detourof multiple transfer on disambiguated represen-tations.
At the same time they provide a flexibleencoding of information essential to steer trans-fer.Of course, semantics does not come for free nordoes it always blend as seamlessly with syntac-tic representations a  one would hope for.
Se-mantics has to be encoded in the grammar ordefined in terms of correspondences as below.System design has to address the question whereto do what at which cost.
Semantic representa-tions pay off when they are useful for a num-ber of tasks: evaluation (as against a database),inference and transfer.
Even more so when ex-isting resources can be interfaced qua semanticrepresentations: in our case the tested transfermethodology and resources developed in (Dornaand Emele, 1996a).Re ferencesH.
