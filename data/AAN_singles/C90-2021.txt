Complex Features in Description of Chinese LanguageFeng ZhiweiImtitute of Applied LinguisticsChinese Academy of Social Sciences51 Chaoyangmen Nanxiaojie100010 Beijing, ChinaAbstractIn this paper, the similarity of" multi-vahw label fimction" and "complex features" iv discussed.
The author especially era.phasizes the necessity of complex feattwes for description of Chinese Iaruguage.1 Multiple- Value Label FunctionThe phrase structure grammar (PSG) was used extensively in the parsing of natural lawguage.
A PSG can be expressed by a tree graph where every node has a correspondent label.The relationship between the node x and its label y can be described by a mono-value labelfunction L:L(x) = yFor every value of node x, there is only one corresponding value of label y.In 1981, we designed a multilingual automatic translation system FAJRA (from Chinese toFrench, English, Japanese, Russian, German).
In 1985; we designed two automatic translationsystems GCAT (from German to Chinese) and FCAT (from French to Chinese).
In systemFAJRA, we must do automatic analysis of Chinese, in system GCAT and FCAT, we must doautomatic generation of Chinese language.
We found that the linguistic features of Chinese ex...pressed by the mono-value label function of PSG is rather limited.
In the automatic analysisof Chinese language, PSG can not treat properly the ambiguity, the result of analysis oftenbring about a lot of ambiguous structures.
In the automatic generation ofChinese language, thegenerative power of PSG is so strong that a lot of ungrammatical sentences are generated.
It isthe chief drawback of PSG.
In order to overcome this drawback of PSG, in system FAJRA,we proposed a multiple- value label function to replace the mono-  value label function, and insystems GCAT and FCAT, we further improved this approach.A multiple-value label function can be described asbelow:L(x) = {y~, Y2,..., Y~}whereby a label x of tree can correspond to several abels {y~, ya, .
.
.
,  y=}.
By the means ol;this function, the generative power of PSG was restricted, the number of ambiguous tructureswere reduced, and the drawback of PSG was efl\]ciently overcome.Beginning with the augmented transition etwork (ATN) concept and .inspired by J.Bresnan'swork on lexically oriented non-transformational linguistics, the lexical functional grammar(LFG)  framework of J. Bresnan and R. Kaplan was evolved.
Simultanously, M. Kay devise(\].the functional m~Afication grammar (FUG)., G. G~dar, E. Klein and G. Pullum proposed.the generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG).
Implementation of GPSG1118at Hewtett-Packard led C. Pollard and his collcgues to design the head-driven phrase struc-ture grm:amar (HPSG) as a successor to GPSG.
In all these formalisms of grammars, thecomplex features are widely used to replace the simple feature of PSG and it is an improvementof PSG.
Therefore, The concept of complex features is very important for present developmentof computational linguistics.In the systems I;A,IRA, GCAT and FCAT, the values of labels must be the features of lan-guage, so the mtdtiple- value labels must be also the complex features of language.
In fact, theconcept of multiple--value labels and the concept of complex features is very similar.Historically, all these concepts are the results of separate researches in computational linguisticsfor improvement of PSG.
ThLts we can take our multiple-value labels as complex features.The famous linguist De Saussure (1857--1913) had pointed out in his <Course in GeneralLinguistics> : " Language in a manner oi" speaking, is a type of algeb,a consisting solely ofcomplex terms" (p122, English version, 1959).
He takes the flexion of" Nacht : N~/chte" inGerman as the example.
The relation "Nacht : Niichte" c:m be expressed by an algebraic formu-la a/b in which a and b are not simple terms but result from a set of relations .
.
.
.
complexterms.
The complex terms of Nacht are: norm, feminine gender, singular number, nominatix'ecase, its principal vowel is "a".
The complex terms of N'~.chte are: noun, feminine gender,plural number, nominative case, its principal vowel is "fi", its ending is "e", the pronunciationof" ch" changes f rom/x / to  /C.'.
De Saussure said: "But language being what it is, we shallfind nothing simple in it regardless oF our approach; every where and always there is the stoneconlplex equilibrium of * " ~ , 1959).
So ~e~m, that mutually condition each other" (P122,E.
v.called" complex terms" mentiot~ed here by Dc Saussure is nothing but the "complex features"or the "multiple -value labels"in computationa!
linguistics.
After all, De Saussure is a scholarwith a foresight, fie has proved himself to be a pioneer of modern linguistics.
The concept of'~omplex terms" oC De Saussure has served as a source of inspiration for tks to proposed the con-cept of "muhiple-value labels".
However, the property of Chinese language is more importantthan the concept of De Saussure in the dex.elopmemnt of our "multiple--value labels"( or "com-plex features" ), because without the "multiple- value labels" (or "complex features" ) we cannot adequately describe the Chinese language in the autornatic translation.
{2 Necessity of Complex Feature for Description of Chinese LanguageIf there is a necessity of complex features in description of' English, then this necessity ismore obvious fbr description of Chinese.The reasons are as following:1.
There is not one--to--one correspondence relation between the phrase types (or parts ofspeech) m~d their syntactic functions in the Chinese sentences.Chinese is dilRrent from Endish.
In English, the phrase types generally correspond to theirsyntactic functions.
For example, we have NP + VP ---  > S in English, whereby NP corre-sponds to subject, VP corresponds to predicate, and S is a sentence, becoming a construction"i19subject + predicate".
There is a one- to -one  correspondence between the phrase types andtheir syntactic ftmctions.
In Chinese, the structure "NP  + VP" can form a sentence, so wehave also NP  + VP - - > S. E. g. in phrase "d~ 2E / IN ~" (little Wang coughs), "/\]x t "(little Wang) is a NP, "~N ~"  (to cough) is a VP, forming a construction" suk!ject.+predicate".
However, in many cases, the NP doesn't correspond to the subject, the VP doesn'tcorrespond to the predicate.
For example, "~y~; / i~~-t"  (progrmming) in Chinese, " .~ j:~"(program) is a NP, "iRi-l" (.to design) is a VP, but this NP  is a modifier, and this VP is thehead of the structure "NP  + VP".
The structure "NP  + VP" can not form a sentence, butfbrm a new noun phrase NPI :  NP  + VP - - > NP\[.
So this noun phrase becomes a con-struction " modifier + head".
Similar example are: "i~--N / ~\ ]~"  (langtuage learning), "~~ / rN-~" (physics examination), etc.
In these phr~,~ses, the phrase tyws "NP + VP" can notform a construction "subject + predicate", but form a construction "modifier -~: head".
Inthis case, the "NP  + VP" is a syntactically ambiguous structure, the simple features " NP+ VP" can not distinguish the differences between the construction "subject + predicate" andthe construction "modifier + head".
We must use the complex features to describe these dif-ferences.The structure " NP -I- VP" which forms a construction " subject + predicate" can beformularized as following complex .feature set:CAT = N + CAT --= V\[_ \[_ SF = SUBJ_  SF = PRED _t _whereby K is the feature of" the phrase type, NP and VP are the values of this feature; CAT isthe feature o\[" the parts of speech, N and V are the values of this feature; SF is the feature o~"syntactic function, SUB.I and PRED are the values of this feature.
With the complex fea-tures, the structure " NP + VP" which forms a construction " modifier + head" can beformutarized as following:CAT = N + CAT = VSF = MODF_  SF = HEADwhereby MODF and HEAD are the values of the feature SF.Obviously, the structure "NP + VP"is ambiguous, there are two syntactically different con-structions included in this structure, their phrase types are identical, but their syntactic func-tions are different.
In order to adequately discribe the differences of them, we have to use thecomplex features in deed.In English, we have VP + NP - ->  VP1, the VP corresponding to the predicate:, theNP to the object, and VP1 is a new verb phrase, it is a construction "predicate + object".
InChinese, the structure "VP + NP"can form a new verb phrase, so we have also VP + NP- - > VP1.
For example, "$,-\]~/~ / I'~'\]~" (to discuss a problem) in Chinese, "$?i"~" (to dis-cttss) is a VP, "l'~-i\]~" (problem)is  a NP, forming a new verb phrase "predicate + object".120However, in many cases, VP doesn't correspond to predicate, NP doesn't correspond to object.
For example, "/di~lR / GN"  (taxicab) in Chinese," ~{ft" (to hire) is a VP, "~"(automobile) is a NP, but this VP is a modifier and this NP is the head of the structure "VP+ NP".
This structure can not form a new verb phrase, it forms a new noun phrase, so wehave: VP + NP - - > NP1.
The syntactic function of this noun phrase is a construction "modi\[ier + head".
The similar examples are:" ~-~ / -_)7 ~," (approach for reseach), "~/~"  (regulation for study), "~P~,Yk/i~" (policy of openning the door).
The phrasetype ,;tructure "VP + NP" can not form a construction "predicate + object", but forms a con-struction "modifier + head".
In this case, the structure "VP + NP" is syntactically ambigu-ous.
The simple features "VP + NP" is not enough to distinguish the differences between theconstruction " predicate + object" and the construction "modifier + head".
We mLmt use thecomplex t~:atures to describe these differences.The structure" VP + NP" which forms aformularized as following complex feature set:I K = VPCAT = V +_ SF = PRED_construction " predicate + object" can beK = NP  -Id CAT = N SF = OBJE_Iwhereby PRED and OBJE are the valuesThe structure " VP + NP" whichformularized as following complex featureI K=VPCAT = VSF = MODF_of feature SF.forms a construction " modifierset:-I- I K=NP -1 CAT = N | !
SF = HEAD2+ head" can bewhereby MODF and HEAD are the values of feature SF.Obviously we can not only use the simple fcature to describe the structure "VP + NP",we have to use the complex features.2.
For the construction which have the same phrase type structure and the same syntactic func-tion structure, its semantic relation may be diflErent.
So there is not simple one- - to -one corre-spondence between the syntactic function and its semantic relation.The values of semantic relation feature are the following: agent, patient, instrument, scope,aim, :result,... etc.
In English, there is no much correspondences between the syntactic func-tion of sentence lement and its semantic relation.
In Chinese, the correspondence is more com-plicated and sophisticated than in English.In the construction" subject + predicate" with corresponding phrase type structure " NP+ VP', the subject may be agent, but it may also be patient, or instrument, etc.
For exam-ple, in the sentence "iIf~/i;~T" (I have read), the subject ":ffB" (I) is the agent, but in thesentence " --p} / ~ T"  ( the book has been read), the subject "@" (book) is the patient, andthe verb " i~T"  (to read) doesn't change its form, it always takes the original form.
In mostEuropean languages, if the subject is the agent, then the verb must take an active form, and if121the subject is patient, then the verb must take the passive form.
However, In Chinese, the verbalways keeps the same form no matter whether the subject is an agent or a patient.
In an over-whelming majority of cases, the passive form of verb is seldom or never used in Chinese.
Bythis reason, in the atttomatic information processing of Chinese language, it is not enough toonly use the features of phrase types and synt~tic functions, we must use the features ofsemantic relations, thus the features for description of Chinese language will become mor~ com-plex.In the structure "NP + VP", if the syntactic function of NP is subject, and the semanticrelation of NP is agent, then the complex features of this structure can be formularized as fol-lowing:\[ K=NP ~ K=VP \]CAT = N + CAT = V \]SF = SUBJ l k. SF = PRED JL SM AGENT _Iwhereby SM is the feature of semantic relation, AGENT is the values of feature SM.In the structure "NP + VP',  if the syntactic function of NP is subject and the semanticrelation of NP is patient, then the complex features of this structure can be formularized as fo l -lowing:K = NPt CAT = NSF = SUBJ_ SM = PAT IENT_+ i K = VP 1 CAT = V SF .
= PREDwhereby PATIENT is the value o\[ feature SM.In the strcture " VP+NP"  with corresponding syntactic construction" predicate +object",the object may be a patient, but it may also be an agent, or an instrument, or a scope, oran aim, or a result , .
.
.
,  etc.
In the sentence "~${/~-Y" (to wipe the window) "~"  , .~, ( towipe) is the predicate, "~"  (window) is the object, and its semantic feature is the patient.The complex features of this sentence can be formularized as following:\[ K = VP -CAT = V\[_SF = PRED+ CAT = NSF = OBJE_ SNI = PATIENT _whereby PATIENT is thc value of feature SM.But we have also the following sentences where the semantic relation of object is not thepatient.
There are many very interesting phenomena in Chinese language: In the sentence "~71" /~."
(the father died), the object "~;~" (father) is the agent of the verb "~T"  (todie).
This structure can be formularized as following comlex feature set:122cK.

The grammatical and semantic fcatures of words play an important role to put f`o>ward the rules of` parsing.
These features can bc used as the couditions in the rules , and123they must be included into the system of complex features.
Thus the complex features is thebasis to set up the rules for parsing of Chinese language.
IIn the structure VP + NP, if the grammatical featme of VP is intransitive verb, then thesyntactic function of VP must be modifier, and the syntactic function of NP must be head.
Thesyntactic function of this structure VP + NP will be "modifier + head".
Thus we can have arule which is described with complex features as following:K = VP x,!
K =TRANS = I-K = VP -~- - ->  I CAT=V /TRANS = IV It !_sF = MODFJ?
I K = NP \] iL%dwhereby TRANS represents he feature of transitb~ty of verb, IV represents intransitive verb,it is a value of feature TRANS.This rule means: In the structure VP + NP, if the value of` TRANS d" VP is IV, then thesyntactical function of VP can be given the value MODF, and the syntactical function of NPcan be given the value HEAD .
.
.
.The semantic features of words can also be used to put forward the rules of' parsing.
In thestructure VP + NP, if VP is transitive verb, then we have to tLSe the semantic Features or NPto decide the valtm of.
syntactic Function of.
this structure.
Generally speaking, if VP is transitiveverb, the semantic feature of.
NP is" abstract hing", or"  title of a technical or processionalpost"', then the syntactical function of.
VP is modifier, and the syntactical function o2 NP ishead.
For example, in the phrase " fill }5~/ ~1 -~~" ~ purt~ose of training) tlne VP ijl\[ ,~,: (totrain) is a transitive verb, a~d the semantic Feature of' NP "i-!
~)"(purpose)is "abstract hing",we can decide that the syntactical f'unction or"-i.il\[ ~,~i" (to train) is m~iificr, and thesyntactical function of "hi ~{J" (purpose)is head.
In the phrase "~ f~';5/ {~.%" (high trainirgteacher), the VP "~I'~}" (to engage in advanced studies) is a transitive verb, the NP ":g?0~"(teacher) is a title of' professional post, thus we can decide that the syntactical function of'VP " :'~i~7"."
(to engage in advanced studies)is m.odi~ier, the sy~tacticaI function of.
NP "~Jili"'(teacher) is head.Therefore we can have two folhvoing rules for parsing:(1)FK-- vP ~ \[K: >-,, -\]ICAT-  V I+/c 'm = ,", / .

On the basis of these complex features, two new values of feature SF can be deduced:SF = MODY and SF = HEAD.With the complex features, we got good results in machine translation systems FAJRA,(3CAT and FCAT (see Annex).BIBLIOGRAPHY\[t\] Feng Zhiwei, multiple-branched and multiple-labeled tree analysis of Chinese sen-tence, <Journal of Artificial Intelligence>, No 2, 1983.\[1211 De Saussure, Course in General Linguistics, English version, 1959.\[311 M.
