A Hierarchical Parsing Approach with Punctuation Processing forLong Chinese SentencesXing LiInstitute of Automation,Chinese Academy ofSciences, Beijing 100080xli@nlpr.ia.ac.cnChengqing ZongInstitute of Automation,Chinese Academy ofSciences, Beijing 100080cqzong@nlpr.ia.ac.cnRile HuInstitute of Automation,CAS, Beijing 100080Nokia (China) ResearchCenter, Hepingli Dongjie11,Beijing 100013rlhu@nlpr.ia.ac.cnAbstractIn this paper, the usage and function ofChinese punctuations are studied insyntactic parsing and a newhierarchical approach is proposed forparsing long Chinese sentences.
Itdifferentiates from most of the previousapproaches mainly in two aspects.Firstly, Chinese punctuations areclassified as ?divide?
punctuations and?ordinary?
ones.
Long sentences whichinclude ?divide?
punctuations arebroken into suitable units, so theparsing will be carried out in two stages.This ?divide-and-rule?
strategy greatlyreduces the difficulty of acquiring theboundaries of sub-sentences andsyntactic structures of sub-sentences orphrases simultaneously in once-levelparsing strategy of previous approaches.Secondly, a grammar rules systemincluding all punctuations andprobability distribution is built to beused in parsing and disambiguating.Experiments show that our approachcan significantly reduce the timeconsumption and numbers ofambiguous edges of traditionalmethods, and also improve theaccuracy and recall when parsing longChinese sentences.1 IntroductionUntil recently, although punctuations are clearlyimportant parts of the written Chinese, manyChinese parsing systems developed to date havesimply ignored them.
Some researches havebeen done on English punctuations in parsing [1,2, 3, 4, 5], their researches have used plenty oftheoretical and experimental facts to prove thatit is effective to incorporate punctuationinformation into parsing of long complexsentences.
But as far as we know, little work hasbeen done in Chinese syntactic parsing.Because the derivation of Chinese punctuationswas referring to western language [3], they havemany similarities in usage.
Researches onChinese punctuations in parsing will be valuable.However, our study shows, there are stilldifferences between them, special research onChinese punctuations is necessary.In this paper, differences in English and Chinesepunctuations are compared and the specialdifficulty and corresponding cause in parsingChinese long sentences are analyzed.
Then anew hierarchical parsing (HP) approach isproposed instead of traditional parsing (TP)method.
This ?divide-and-rule?
strategy greatlyreduces the time consumption.
Open test shows,parsing accuracy and recall of HP method areboth about 7% higher than those of TP.The remainder of this paper is organized asfollows: Section 2 is related work.
Section 3mainly discusses the special difficulties andsolution in parsing long Chinese sentences.
ThenHP method is discussed in detail in Section 4.Section 5 gives the final experiment results andcorresponding analyses.
Finally, the furtherwork is expected.2 Related WorkNunberg?s The Linguistics of Punctuation [2] isthe foundation for most of the latter researches7in syntactic account of punctuation.
In hisimportant study, he advocates two separategrammars, operating at different levels.
Alexical grammar accounts for the text-categories(text-clauses, text-phrases) occurring betweenthe punctuation marks, and a text grammar dealswith the structure of punctuation, and therelation of those marks to the lexical expressionsthey separate.Based on above theory, Jones proposes hismethod which uses an integrated grammar.
Hedivided punctuations into conjoining andadjoining punctuation.
Conjoining punctuationscan be used to indicate coordinate relationshipbetween components.
Adjoining punctuations,otherwise, only can be attached to their adjacentsentence components.
In Jones?
theory, in asense, conjoining punctuation could also betreated under the adjunctive principle [3].
So,punctuations in his theory are still attached toadjacent lexical expressions.
An integratedsyntactic punctuation grammar is given.Jones?
method shows good modularity.However, the grammars he designed can onlycover a subset of all punctuation phenomena.His experiment shows that when parsing a set often previously unseen punctuationally complexsentences, seven of the ten are unparsable!In Chinese, Zhou Qiang[6] has usedpunctuations to do automatic acquisition ofcoordinate phrases.
In machine translation,Chengqing Zong[7] and Huang He-yan[8] haveused punctuations associating with relativepronouns to segment complex sentences intoseveral independent simple sentences.
Above all,none of previous work has carried out athorough study on punctuations from thesyntactic point of view.3 Motivations3.1 Differences between Chinese andEnglish PunctuationsIn Chinese, there are some punctuations whichdon?t exist in English.
The first one is a pair ofChinese book-name mark ???
and ??
?, whichare obvious marks that the content between themmust be name of a book.
The second one ispause mark ??
?, which replaces comma as theseparating mark between coordinate components.For instance, sentence ?I like to walk, skip, andrun.?
can be translated into Chinese one as ????????????.
Chinese pause mark isthe evident mark with the exclusive usage is toseparate coordinate words or simple phrases, soit is easier to get coordinate words or simplephrases in Chinese sentences.3.2 Special Difficulty in Parsing LongChinese SentencesIn essence, English is a kind of hypotaxislanguage, so an intact syntax structure denotes asentence.
When several simple sentences areconnected to form a compound sentence, thereshould be obvious conjunctions between them.Differently, Chinese is a kind of parataxislanguage, and the language unit which expressesa complete thought is an intact Chinese sentence.Therefore, several sentences with associativemeanings can be connected by comepunctuations to form a compound one withoutany conjunctions.
This type of sentence is called?run-on sentence?, and which is prevalent inChinese.
For example, we randomly selected4431 sentences whose lengths are over 30characters from a Chinese corpus named TCT973.1 There are 1830 run-on sentences, covering41.3%.
Chinese sentence ???????????????????????
is this kind ofsentence.
The corresponding English meaning is?Now, I am not young and I still have to takebus to work everyday,  which make me verytired?.
So, in above Chinese sentences, commasare used not only as separating marks of sub-sentences but also as separating marks ofcomponents in one sub-sentence.
However, lackof connections makes methods [7, 8] ofsegmenting complex sentences invalid.
In thissituation, acquisition of the boundaries of sub-sentences and syntactic structure of sub-sentences or phrases should be donesimultaneously in once-level parsing strategy,which will undoubtedly increase the difficulty ofparsing long sentences.3.3 Corresponding SolutionIn order to solve this problem, a hierarchicalparsing (HP) approach is proposed by us.Nunberg?s theory of two categories grammarsprovides us the theoretical base of HP approach.1 Please refer to http://www.chineseldc.org/8According to his definition of two categories ofgrammars described in section 2, the twogrammars can operate at different levelsindependently.
Punctuations which can occur aselements of text grammar are defined by us as?divide?
punctuations.
Then punctuations whichcan occur as elements of lexical grammar are?ordinary?
ones.
The ?divide?
punctuations canbe used to divide the whole sentence into severalparts.
Then the parsing will be carried out in twosteps.
Thus, acquisition of syntactic structure ofsub-sentences or phrases is done in the first levelparsing, and acquisition of the boundaries ofsub-sentences and relationship of sub-sentencesor phrases can be done in second level parsing.This is the main idea of HP approach, which canreduce the difficulty of parsing run-on sentencesand other types of compound sentences.
Theframework of HP approach is shown asfollowing Figure 1:OriginalsentenceSub-sen.1Sub-sen.3Sub-sen.2Sub-sen.n?

Framework of HP Approach4  Hierarchical Parsing Approach4.1 Classification of Chinese PunctuationsIn this paper, the ?divide?
punctuations aredefined as follows: If lexical sentences orphrases which are separated by certainpunctuations must be correlative to each otherwholly not partly, these punctuations are in levelof text grammar, which are classified as ?divide?punctuations.
Punctuations in a and b of Figure2 are examples of two categories of punctuations( P stands for punctuations).In Chinese, the semicolon is used to separatecoordinate sub-sentences.
The colon is used asseparation mark of interpretative phrases or sub-sentences from former sub-sentences.
So,according to above definition, they can beclassified as ?divide?
punctuations.
The comma,specially, can occur as a mark of coordinatephrases element.
So, using of it as ?divide?punctuation may cause improper divisionproblems and a compensatory solution isintroduced in, which will be discussed in detailin Section 4.3.3.Figure  2.
?Divide?
punctuations (first) and?ordinary?
punctuations (second)4.2 Grammar RulesThe automatic extraction of grammar ruleswhich include punctuations depends on largescales of parsed Chinese corpus which hasample syntactic phenomena and standard usageof punctuations.
Fortunately, Chinese tree-banknamed TCT 973 is such a corpus.
It includes1,000, 000 words and covers all kinds of textafter 1990th.
The average length of each sentenceis 23.3 words.
Long sentences of over 20 wordslength account for half of it.Firstly, original grammar rules are extracted.Then generalizations are done about the use ofthe various punctuation marks from the rules set.For example, as mentioned before, Chinesebook-name mark ??
?
and ??
?are obviousmarks that the content between ?
?
?
and??
?must be name of a book by any syntacticcategory.
Therefore, a generalized rule can bededuced as below::{ , , ,  ......}?NP X X NP VP S PP?
?
(1)In above generalized rule, X can be any POS ofphrases or single word, so possible rules thathave not been deduced from tree-bank are addedinto the grammar rules set with probabilities 1.Except for above special situations,corresponding probabilities of all grammar rulesare computed by Maximum Likelihood Estimate9(MLE) method.At last, all rules are combined toform an intact grammar system.4.3  Parsing Strategy4.3.1  Sentence DivisionDepending on above classification, commas,semicolons and colons are used to dividesentences into a series of sub-sentences.
Noticethat quotation marks and parenthesis are treatedas transparent and syntactically non-functional.4.3.2  First Level ParsingAll sub-sentences and phrases gotten from thedivision processing are inputs of the first levelparsing.
A chart parsing algorithm is used here.The grammar rules and correspondingprobabilities are used to do parsing anddisambiguating.
Then for all sub-sentences andphrases, their parsing trees are the highestprobabilities ones of all possible trees.4.3.3 Detection of Improper Division andCombinationBecause of the specialty of comma, using of itas the division mark may cause improperdivisions.
The main causation is improperdivision between coordinate phrases which havebeen same component of the sentence.
Forexample, Chinese sentence ?????????????????????????????????????????????
is atypical coordinate structure similar to ?I like todo ..., to do ..., to do..., but I like better to...?
inEnglish.
So, the first three ???
?are coordinatepredicates of the sentences.
Then the improperdivision will break up this relationship.
In thissection, a detection and combination method isproposed by us to solve this problem in parsingChinese sentences.Because the lexical expressions surroundingpunctuations are parsed in first level parsing, itis easy to get their internal syntactic structuresinformation we need.
Just a simple analysisprocedure is needed to judge if there exists sucha coordinate relationship between lexicalexpressions surrounding commas.A description of the analysis strategy is givenaccording to this example.Just like Figure 3 shows, the components afterthe first comma are parsed as verb phrase (VP)marked as B.
Obviously B is composed of apreposition phrase (PP) and a verb phrase.
Ifthere exists a minimal length of phraseimmediately before the first comma and thisphrase has totally the same structure to phrase B,then they are coordinate phrases.
In Figure 3, A2is such a phrase.
The components after othercommas are analyzed similarly.
Finally, A2, Band C are coordinate phrases.
Since the verbphrase D immediately after the second commahas obviously different structure from A2, B andC, so they aren?t coordinate components.
Thepart-of-speech tags throughout this paper followthe standard of TCT973.Figure 3.
Syntactic structure of examplesentenceThrough the above analysis, we can see that thefirst and second commas are actually in level oflexical grammar, using them as ?divide?punctuations will cause the improper division asshown in Figure 2 of b.
Therefore, we present amethod to use sub-tree adjoining operation,firstly combine the sub-tree A2 with tree B and C,then use the new tree A2?
to replace original A2without changing original structure of A .
Figure4 shows the adjoining procedure.Figure 4.
Sub-tree adjoining operationThen the execution conditions and results ofsuch adjoining operation are summarized asfollowing rules:[ ] [ ... ] [ [[ ] ] ... ]+ +?S X Y Y S X X X Y YX?
?
?
?X = {NP, VP, AP, DP} ,  S stands for sentence,Y = * ( any legal POS)(2)[ ... ][ ] [ ... [ [ ] ]]+ +?S Y Y X S Y Y X X XX?
?
?
?X = {NP, VP, AP, DP} ,  S stands for sentence,Y = * ( any legal POS)(3)10The execution conditions of both Rule (2) and (3)are defined as follows:  all X should becoordinate phrases with the same syntacticcategories.4.3.4  Second Level ParsingThe parsing algorithm of this module is totallythe same to the first level parsing; with thedifference is the input string.
At the first parsingstage, inputs are POS sequence of words, but atthe second parsing stage, inputs are POSsequence of all sub-tree root nodes.
After thisstage of parsing, the best parsing trees of wholesentences will be constructed.5 Performance Evaluation5.1 Test SentencesThe primary aim of the HP strategy is to takeuse of the punctuation information to help toconquer the difficulty of parsing long sentences.Chinese sentences with over 20 words aregenerally regarded as long sentences.
Therefore,we conduct experiments on the sentences withthe length over 20 words.Firstly, 8,059 sentences were chosen randomlyfrom TCT 973 as train set.
The 3,795 PCFGrules used in our system are extracted from thetrain set after generalizing.
Then, for other 847sentences, whose lengths are less than 20 wordsare filtered and 420 sentences are finallyconserved as our open test data set.
Distributionof these sentences is shown in Table 1 below:Text Type Number ofSenLength ofSen(Words)AverageLength ofSen (Words)Literature 116 21?123 36.06News 123 22?100 37.73Science 114 21?131 39.47Practical writing 67 20?98 38.36Total 420 20?131 37.84Table 1.
Distribution of test sentences5.2  Efficiency EvaluationIn order to compare our HP approach with TPmethod of once-parsing algorithm, we docompared experiments using same data set inTable 1 and same grammar rules set.5.2.1  Time Consumption EvaluationRunning two systems on a PC (Pentium 4,1.20GHz, 256M of RAM), their timeconsumptions are shown in Figure 5.Time Consumed Comparison02040608010012014016020 40 60 80 100 120 140Length of Sentence(Words)TimeConsumed(sec)HP methodTP methodFigure 5.
Time consumptionIn our experiment system, we set the upper limitexecution time as 120 seconds per sentence,judging at the end of every algorithm cycle.When parsing time of the sentence is overtime,the system will exit without getting final result.Experiment results shown in Fig.5 prove thattime efficiency of HP method is greatly superiorto TP, especially when the sentence has morethan 40 words.
With the increasing of sentencelength, it is more difficult for TP method toparse successfully.5.2.2  Accuracy and Recall EvaluationFirstly, Table 2 shows numbers of sentencesfailed to be parsed in two methods with the timelimitation of 120 seconds.MethodsNumbers ofTest  SenNumbers ofFailed Sen RatioTP 420 97 23.1%HP 420 16 3.8%Table 2.
Ratio of failed sentencesIt is evident that HP method can largely reducefailed sentences in given time limitation.Then, except for failed sentences, onlyconsidering the successfully parsed sentences,the parsing accuracy and recall of the twomethods should be compared.
The standardPARSEVAL measures [9] are used to evaluatetwo methods.
Results are shown in Table 3.From Table 3, we can see that the total parsingaccuracy and recall of HP method are bothalmost 7% higher than those of TP method.Amounts of average crossing brackets are alsoreduced greatly.11Analyzing data in Table 3, to different text types,the accuracy and improvement effect of TPmethod are slightly different.
Sentences ofliterature text have the highest parsing accuracyand recall.
Studied show that there are 97 ?run-on sentences?
in the 116 literature text sentences,covering 84%.
The comparatively higheraccuracy and recall of these sentences prove thatour HP approach is effective.TexttypeMethodLP% LR% CBs 0CB%?2CBs%TP 67.31 66.76 6.97 19.77 48.84 Literature HP 73.57 73.77 3.24 40.74 62.09TP 61.05 61.69 5.80 10.47 34.88 News HP 70.66 70.58 3.52 28.33 61.83TP 61.20 60.89 5.63 12.66 37.97 Science HP 68.74 68.98 4.14 23.37 59.10TP 64.10 64.61 6.17 6.25 27.08 Practicalwriting HP 66.55 67.81 4.68 21.54 50.77TP 63.38 63.41 6.14 13.04 38.46 Total HP 70.06 70.03 3.80 30.24 61.01Table 3.

Becausecomparing to other three types, sentences of thistype have more long nested noun phrases orcoordinate components, such as longorganization names and commodity names,which will cause noun phrase combinationdisambiguation.6  Conclusion and Future WorkThis paper studies the usage and function ofChinese punctuations in syntactic parsing.
Anew hierarchical parsing approach is proposed.Besides, a grammar rules system including allpunctuations and probability distribution is builtto be used in parsing and disambiguation.Compared experiments prove that HP method iseffective in long Chinese sentences parsing.In future work, theories of punctuations shouldbe studied further to get a more formal point ofview.AcknowledgesThe research work is supported by the nationalnatural science foundation of China under grantNo.60375018 and 60121302, and also supportedby the outstanding oversea scholar foundation ofCAS.References1.
