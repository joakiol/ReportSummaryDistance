Our approachis language independent, and was used toparticipate in the CLTE task (Task#8) or-ganized within Semeval 2013 (Negri et al2013).
The four runs submitted, one foreach language combination covered by the testdata (i.e.
Spanish/English, German/English,French/English and Italian/English), achievedencouraging results.
In terms of accuracy,performance ranges from 38.8% (for Ger-man/English) to 43.2% (for Italian/English).On the Italian/English and Spanish/Englishtest sets our systems ranked second amongfive participants, close to the top results (re-spectively 43.4% and 45.4%).1 IntroductionCross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) is an ex-tension of the Textual Entailment task (Dagan andGlickman, 2004) that consists in deciding, giventwo texts T and H written in different languages(respectively called text and hypothesis), if H canbe inferred from T (Mehdad et al 2010).
In thecase of SemEval 2013, the task is formulated asa multi-class classification problem in which thereare four possible relations between T and H: for-ward (T ?
H), backward (T ?
H), bidirectional(T ?
H) and ?no entailment?.Targeting the identification of semantic equiva-lence and information disparity between topicallyrelated sentences, CLTE recognition can be seen as acore task for a number of cross-lingual applications.Among others, multilingual content synchronizationhas been recently proposed as an ideal frameworkfor the exploitation of CLTE components and the in-tegration of semantics and machine translation (MT)technology (Mehdad et al 2011; Mehdad et al2012b; Bronner et al 2012; Monz et al 2011).In the last few years, several methods have beenproposed for CLTE.
These can be roughly dividedin two main groups (Negri et al 2012): i) those us-ing a pivoting strategy by translating H into the lan-guage of T and then using monolingual TE compo-nents1, and those directly using cross-lingual strate-gies.
Among this second group, several sources ofcross-lingual knowledge have been used, such asdictionaries (Kouylekov et al 2012; Perini, 2012),phrase and paraphrase tables (Mehdad et al 2012a),GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) word alignment mod-els (Wa?schle and Fendrich, 2012), MT of sub-segments (Espla`-Gomis et al 2012), or semanticWordnets (Castillo, 2011).In this work we propose a CLTE detection methodbased on a new set of features using word align-ment as a source of cross-lingual knowledge.
Thisset, which is richer than the one by (Wa?schle andFendrich, 2012), is aimed not only at grasping infor-mation about the proportion of aligned words, butalso about the distribution of the alignments in both1In the first CLTE evaluation round at Semeval 2012, forinstance, the system described in (Meng et al 2012) used theopen source EDITS system (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010; Negriet al 2009) to calculate similarity scores between monolingualEnglish pairs.128H and T .
This set of features is later used by twosupport vector machine (SVM) classifiers for detect-ing CLTE separately in both directions (T ?
H andT ?
H).
We use the combined output of both clas-sifiers for performing the CLTE detection.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2describes the features used and the classificationmethod; Section 3 explains the experimental frame-work and the results obtained for the differentlanguage-pair sets; finally, the conclusions obtainedfrom the results are summarised in Section 4.2 ALTN SystemIn our approach we have implemented a systembased on supervised learning.
It takes an unlabeledsentence pair as input (T and H) and labels it au-tomatically with one of the possible four valid en-tailment relations.
The architecture is depicted inFigure 1.A key component to our approach is the wordalignment model.
In a preprocessing step it istrained on a set of parallel texts for the target lan-guage pair.
Next, different features based on theword alignment are extracted.
Taking the featuresand the target language pair labels as input, a su-pervised learning algorithm is run to fit a model tothe data.
The last step is to use the model to au-tomatically label unseen instances with entailmentrelations.2.1 FeaturesWhat characterizes our submission is the use ofword alignment features to capture entailment rela-tions.
We extract the following features from a wordalignment model for a given sentence pair (all fea-tures are calculated for both T and H):?
proportion of aligned words in the sentence(baseline);?
number of unaligned sequences of words nor-malized by the length of the sentence;?
length of the longest sequence of aligned wordsnormalized by the length of the sentence;?
length of the longest sequence of unalignedwords normalized by the length of the sentence;Figure 1: System architecture?
average length of the aligned word sequences;?
average length of the unaligned word se-quences;?
position of the first unaligned word normalizedby the length of the sentence;?
position of the last unaligned word normalizedby the lenght of the sentence;?
proportion of aligned n-grams in the sentence(n varying from 1 to 5).These features are language independent as theyare obtained from statistical models that take as in-put a parallel corpus.
Provided that there exist paral-lel data for a given language pair, the only constraintin terms of resources, the adoption of these featuresmakes our approach virtually portable across lan-guages with limited effort.2.2 CLTE ModelOur CLTE model is composed by two supervised bi-nary classifiers that predict whether there is entail-ment between the T and H .
One classifier checks129for forward entailment (T ?
H) and the otherchecks for backward entailment (T ?
H).
The out-put of both classifiers is combined to form the fourvalid entailment decisions:?
forward and backward classifier output true:?bidirectional?
entailment;?
forward is true and backward is false:?forward?
entailment;?
forward is false and backward is true:?backward?
entailment;?
both forward and backward output false: ?noentailment?
relation.Both binary classifiers were implemented usingthe SVM implementation of Weka (Hall et al2009).3 ExperimentsIn our submission we experimented with three stan-dard word alignment algorithms: the hidden Markovmodel (HMM) (Vogel et al 1996) and IBM models3 and 4 (Brown et al 1993).
They are implementedin the MGIZA++ package (Gao and Vogel, 2008).Building on a probabilistic lexical model to establishmappings between words in two languages, thesemodels compute alignments between the word po-sitions in two input sentences S1 and S2.
The mod-els are trained incrementally: HMM is the base forIBM model 3, which is the base for IBM model 4.To train our models, we used 5 iterations of HMM,and 3 iterations of IBM models 3 and 4.Word alignments produced by these models areasymmetric (S1 ?
S2 6= S2 ?
S1).
To copewith this, different heuristics (Koehn et al 2005)have been proposed to obtain symmetric alignmentsfrom two asymmetric sets (S1 ?
S2).
We ex-perimented with three symmetrization heuristics,namely: union, intersection, and grow-diag-final-and, a more complex symmetrization method whichcombines intersection with some alignments fromthe union.To train the word alignment models we usedthe Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) con-catenated with the News Commentary corpus2 for2http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.html#downloadthree language pairs: English-German (2,079,049sentences), English-Spanish (2,123,036 sentences),English-French (2,144,820 sentences).
For English-Italian we only used the parallel data available in Eu-roparl (1,909,115 sentences) since this language pairis not covered by the News Commentary corpus.For our submitted run the SVM classifiers weretrained using the whole training set.
Such datasetconsists of 1,000 pairs for each of the four languagecombinations, resulting from a concatenation of thetraining and test sets used for the first round of eval-uation at SemEval 2012 (Negri et al 2012; Negri etal., 2011).
We have set a polynomial kernel with pa-rameters empirically estimated on the training set:C = 2.0, and d = 1.
After some preliminary ex-periments we have concluded that the HMM modelin conjunction with the intersection symmetrizationprovides the best results.Our results, calculated over the 500 test pairs pro-vided for each language combination, are presentedin Table 3.
As can be seen from the table, our systemconsistently outperforms the best average run of allparticipants and is the second best system for Span-ish/English and Italian/English.
For the other twolanguages, French/English and German/English, itis the 3rd best system with a larger distance from topresults.
The motivations for such lower results, cur-rently under investigation, might be related to lowerperformance in terms of word alignment, the coreof our approach.
The first step of our analysis willhence address, and in case try to cope with, signifi-cant differences in word alignment performance af-fecting results.Overall, considering the small distance from topresults, and the fact that our approach does not re-quire deep linguistic processing to be reasonably ef-fective for any language pair for which parallel cor-pora are available, our results are encouraging andmotivate further research along such direction.4 ConclusionIn this paper we presented the participation of theFondazione Bruno Kessler in the Semeval 2013Task#8 on Cross-lingual Textual Entailment forContent Synchronization.
To identify entailment re-lations between texts in different languages, our sys-tem explores the use of word alignment features130Features / Language pair German/English Spanish/English French/English Italian/EnglishAvg best runs 0.378 0.404 0.407 0.405ALTN 0.388 0.428 0.420 0.432Best system 0.452 0.434 0.458 0.454Table 1: Accuracy results for the language pairs evaluated for the average of the best runs of the participating systems,our submission and the best systems.within a supervised learning setting.
In our ap-proach, word alignment models obtained by statis-tical methods from parallel corpora leverage infor-mation about the number, the proportion, and thedistribution of aligned terms in the input sentences.In terms of accuracy results over the SemEval 2013CLTE test data, performance ranges from 38.8%(for German/English) to 43.2% (for Italian/English).On the Italian/English and Spanish/English test setsour systems ranked second among five participants,close to the top results (respectively 43.4% and45.4%).
Such results suggest that the use of wordalignment models to capture sentence-level seman-tic relations in different language settings representsa promising research direction.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been partially supported by the EC-funded project CoSyne (FP7-ICT-4-248531).ReferencesAmit Bronner, Matteo Negri, Yashar Mehdad, AngelaFahrni, and Christof Monz.
