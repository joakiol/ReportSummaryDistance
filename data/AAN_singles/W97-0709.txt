IntroductionThe advantages of using stattsucal methods whendealing w~th large volumes of text are known Namely,thelr capabdny of facing any kind of subjects, withoutfeanng the most baroque syntacucal structures, andalways produ~ng an answer whlch, though varying mhabthty, ts always more useful than "fad"The scope of the present work Is the use ofstat|st|cal methods to remeve a most ssgn~ficantparagraph sn a newspaper amcle The method wepropose nught help a reader m getung a qmck ghmpseof the contents of a newspaper and dccldmg whlcharticles deserve a full reading It can besldes facthtatesearches through journalmttc text bases But we are alsointerested on pruning the amount of text to beautomatically processedfor robust understanding ofnatural language Thls wdl enable conceptual baseddocument representation and conceptual mformat~onretrieval (Mauldm 1991)The process Is based on rcmeving theco-occurrences wlth hlgher resolving power m eachdocument, using them to estabhsh hnks betweenparagraphs, and selecting the paragraph with morehnks to other paragraph sTests performed vdth the support of a base corpus ofabout 500 thousand words were able to identify a mostslgn!ficant paragraph m 7 out of I0 newspaper a uclesWe present, m annex, the results of some experimentsconcerning one of the arucles2.
AntecedentsAn Idea borrowed from Information Retrieval, tsthat a term will be so more relevant m a document themore frequently n occurs m that document, and the lessfrequently Itoccurs m a base corpusMaarek (1992), followmg other authors, considersthat using paws of words as an indexing umt ~s moreadequate to mformauon retrieval than usmg singlewords IntmUvely, n is planslble to adnut that, formstanee, the pmr \[rile system\] ts far more mformauvethan the words file and .~stem taken m lsolattonMaarek alms at remeving pmrs of lextcally relatedwords In Enghsh, 98% of the lexlcal relations occurbetween words within a span of 5 words m a sentence.s e,  the window to consider when extracting wordsrelated to word w, should span from postttuon w-5 tow+5 Maarek also defines the resolwng power of a parrm a document d asP = ~'Pd log Pcwhere Pd is the observed probabshty of appearance ofthe pan" m document d, Pc the observed probabdny ofthe pmr recorpus, and -log Pc the quantity ofmformauon assocmted tothe pmr It Is easdy seen thatp wall be h|gher, the higher the frequency of the pmr mthe document and the lower sts frequency m the corpus,which agrees wlth the sdea presented at the begmnmgof this secttonChurch and Hanks (1990) propose the apphcatlonof the concept of mutual mformattone(x,y)~,(x.y) = hog2 ecx)e(y)51to the retrieval, ro a corpus, of pairs of lextcally relatedwords They alsoconslder a word span of :e5 words andobserve that "roterestrog" pmr, s generally present amutual mformatxon above 3Salton and.Allan (1995) foc~as on paragraph levelEach paragraph Is represented by a weighed vector,where each element is a term (typically.
word stems,a_f~r excluchng those in a stop hsO The weight of eachterm reflects (as usual) posmve~y its frequency in thedocument and negatively its frequency m the corpusUsrog a roeasure of smulanty between vectors andapplying a sumlanty threshold, one can define whichparagraphs are linked They then constder of centraltmportance the paragraph with the largest number ofconneottons to other paragraphsThe idea underl3ang the present work was tointegrate these 3 approaches and to apply the resultingroethod to newspaper articles, w~th the purpose ofretnewng, ro each article, a roost mgmficant paragraph3.
The  proposed  approachAs stated before, the method of Church and Hanksidentifies pmrs of lexlcally related words So, forinstance, the pair \[conselho seguranfa\] (securityconned), with an assocmted mutual mforn~uon of 5.3,can be considered as a potential mdexang term, whilethe pan" \[para a\] (to the), though 63 tunes roerefrequent ro our corpus, having a mutual roformauon of0.7, can be excluded We have then a erttenon forexclusion, that dispenses with the need for stop hsts,and that alms at assunng the exlstence of a leracalrelation between the words of the rematrong pairsBut not all pans of lexlcally related words are goodrodexmg terms of a document The pair should alsomeet the reqmrement of being relevant m theconsidered document The method of Maarek proposesa measure of the resolvrog power of each pair ro theconcerned document, thus enabling the selection,among all the poten.al indexing terms, of those thatare relevant m each document For rostanco, \[estadosumdos\] (united states) has a hxgh mutual roformatmn(8 1) but it can be of little relevance m an article aboutthe hberatton of prisoners by the Serbs of Sarajevo(p=0007) The experiments earned out point to athreshold of the resolwng power around 0 01 Weconsider as relevant ro a document only the pairs vath aresolvrog power above this thresholdWhen the same pmr occurs ro chfferent paragraphsof the same document, hnks can be estabhshed betweenthose paragraphs At flus point, we only consider pairsthat were not excluded ro prewous steps (mutualroformatton > 3 and resolwng power > 0 01) Though,each hnk Is not hnuted to pairs of words In fact, the52wider the hnk, the higher its relevance Afterprocessing a document, we often get overlapping pmrsFor instance, m an amcle where the expression dos tr~santJgos behgerantea (of the three former contenders) tsused repeatedly, the foll0vang pmrs were retrieved\[tr~s behgerantes\] \[an~gos behgerantes\] \[dosbehgerantes\] 1By ohserwng the overlap of these pmrs ro the verydocument, a single hnk can be retrieved, m the form ofthe tuple \[dos trOs antlgos behgerantes\]Adaptmg the roethod of Salton and Allan, we canformulate the hypothesis that the paragraph vath thelarger number of hnks to other paragraphs would be ofcentral impox~tance in the documentIn summary, the steps of the proposed method are*m a base corpus, compute the frequency of eachword and the frequency of each co-occurrence,consadenng a window spanrong from posihon 14,-5to w+5,*to each document c~mpute, smuIarly, thefrequency of each word and each co-occurrence,*exclude, from the co-?r.e~m'ences \]dent:fled m thedocument, those presenting a mutual mformatlonor a resolving power under the defined thresholds(I(x,y) < 3 or p < 0 01),?
take the selected pans and group the overlappingones, the resulting tuples (pairs and groups ofpairs) occmTmg repeatedly rodifferent paragraphsestabhsh hnks between those paragraphs,*hypothetically, the paragraph presenting a largernumber of hnk~ to other paragraphs wall be ofcentral ,mportanco inthe documentIt should be noted that this proposal, compared toSalton and Allan's, has the advantages (at least rotheory) of avotchng the use, always arbitrary, of stophsts 2, and of basing the calculations exclusively on thetuples that are relevant ro the document, instead ofusing the heavy vectors containing all the terms of eachparagraph We don't have, so far, enough data to makeany clmm about he comparative quahty of the links1 pairs \[tr~s antlgos\] [dos an#gos\], though considered relevant,didn't score enough mutuat reformat=on to be selected2 the relevance of a word depends on the context, so, we prefernot to a pnon exclude any word, by sandtng it to a stop kst Infact, some of the tuplas we retheved as relevant include wordsthat would otherw=se be pad of such a Ist An example m thepmr \[n~o ahnhados\] (nonaligned) where the word n,~o (not)though quite significant n context, would be excluded wa stop#st .iI|j:!IiIi1I4.
