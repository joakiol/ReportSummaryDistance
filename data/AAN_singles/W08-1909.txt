Those dictionaries,being created especially for NLP system,provide for every lexeme not only dataabout its characteristics as a separateitem, but also different types ofinformation about its syntactic andsemantic links to other lexemes.The paper shows how the informationabout certain types of semantic linksbetween lexemes represented in thedictionaries can be used in a machinetranslation system.
The paper deals withcorrespondences between lexical-functional constructions of different typesin the Russian and the English languages.Lexical-functional construction is aword-combination consisting of anargument of a lexical function and a valueof this lexical function for this argument.The paper describes the cases when alexical functional construction in one ofthese languages corresponds to a lexical-functional construction in the otherlanguage, but lexical functionsrepresented by these two constructionsare different.
The paper lists differenttypes of correspondences and gives thereasons for their existence.
It also showshow the information about thesecorrespondences can be used to improvethe work of the linguistic component ofthe machine translation system ETAP-3.?

Some rights reserved.1 IntroductionThe concept of lexical function (LF) wasproposed in Igor Mel?uk's ?Meaning ?
TextTheory?
(Mel?uk, 1974; Mel?uk &Zholkovsky, 1984; Mel?uk et al, 1984, 1988,1992) as the means of description of certain typesof lexeme meaning correlations.
?Lexicalfunction f describes the dependence thatdetermines for the certain word or word-combination such a multitude of words or word-combinations {Yi}=f(X), that for every 1, 2 thefollowing statement is true: if f(1) and f(2)exist, then there is always the same semanticcorrelation between f(1) and 1, on the onehand, and between f(2) and 2, on the otherhand?.
(Mel?uk, 1974)Soon lexical-functional description turned outto be of great value for the systems of naturallanguage processing.
Different ways the LFdescription can be used in NLP system aredescribed in (Apresjan et al, 2003).
As far asmachine translation is concerned, lexicalfunctions play an important role in it, being used,in particular, for providing translationequivalents.The mechanism of their usage is the following:if in one language (L1) X1 is an argument of thelexical function lf1, and lf1(X1)=Y1, and X1 hasa translation equivalent X2 in another language(L2), and X2 is an argument of the same lexicalfunction lf1, and lf1(X2)=Y2, then if in theprocess of translation from L1 to L2 a word-combination ?X1+Y1?
turns out to be a lexical-functional construction2 representing lf1, X1 isreplaced with X2, and Y1 is replaced with Y22Lexical-functional construction, or lexical-functionalword-combination, is a word-combination consisting ofan argument of a lexical function and a value of givenlexical function for the same argument.64irrespective of the fact what trivial translationequivalent3 it has.
(1)  IncepReal1 (bus) = takeIncepReal1 (avtobus) = sadit?sja na(avtobus ?
bus)(sadit?sja na ?
sit on, brat?
- take)To take a bus is translated as sadit?sja naavtobus, not brat?
avtobus.In the system of machine translation ETAP-3information about LF links between the words isstored in the dictionaries4.
If a lexeme is anargument of one or several lexical functions, thelist of these LFs is written in the dictionary entryof this lexeme along with the values of these LFsfor this argument.
Thus, dictionary entry of theword bus includes the following fragment:IncepReal1: takeSuch a way of storage allows the informationabout LF links between words to be easily usedin the process of translation.The described above mechanism of usage oflexical functions in the process of translation isvery useful, but it can be implemented only if X1and X2 are arguments of the same lexicalfunction, and Russian and English do not providesuch a correspondence in 100% of cases.If such a direct correspondence between twolanguages does not exist, information aboutlexical functions can still be used for providingproper translation equivalents.
In many cases?X1+Y1?
and its translation equivalent are bothLF constructions but representing differentlexical functions.The goal of this paper is to describe differenttypes of such correspondences, to explain thereasons of their existence, and to show the waysthey can be used in a  machine translationsystem.2 Translation and false homonymyThe first type of lexical-functionalcorrespondences I would like to mention isdescribed in an earlier paper (Andreyeva, 2007).That paper is devoted to homonymous word-combinations which are lexical-functional at leastin one of its meanings.
It describes different3Trivial translation equivalent of a word from L1 is itsdefault translations equivalent in L2, or translationequivalent this word from L1 has as a separate word.4The system has a separate dictionary for every language.types of homonymy, and one of them is so-calledfalse homonymy.This type of homonymy characterizes LFconstructions which are not actuallyhomonymous having only one meaning each, butevery such construction can be described with thehelp of at least two lexical functions.
(2) to conclude an agreementAs I note in (Andreyeva, 2007), the word-combination from (2) can be described with thehelp of two LFs (IncepOper1 and CausFunc0),but the way of description does not change themeaning: ?to begin to have an agreement?
(IncepOper1) or ?to cause an agreement to takeplace?
(CausFunc0) are two descriptions of thesame situation, not descriptions of two differentsituations.In (Andreyeva, 2007) I show that (2) is notunique, there exist quite big groups of non-homonymous word-combinations which can alsobe described with the help of the same pair oflexical functions.
These are, for example,arguments of LF IncepOper1 with the valuebegin (to begin an argument, a battle, a struggleand so on).There exists also a much larger group of wordsdenoting different objects that can be created thisor that way (to grow plants, to write music etc).In this case the word-combinations can bedescribed with the help of both CausFunc0 andOper1.The work also shows one more pair of lexicalfunctions describing the same constructions -FinOper1 and LiquFunc0 (to stop the battle, forexample).In (Andreyeva, 2007) it is claimed that thereare several reasons of the existence of falsehomonymy.First, the descriptions of lexical functions arequite general and approximate.
The creators ofthe system of LF did not have an aim to divide allthe possible situations into non-crossing classes,the aim was to describe the main prototypicalsemantic correspondences.Second, lexical functions were initially createdfor the description of situations.
Their usage forthe description of objects produced additionalcases of false homonymy.To sum it up, it is possible to list three pairs oflexical functions, and each pair can be used forthe description of a non-homonymous word-combination:65         English         English1.
IncepOper1 (X)     CausFunc0 (X)2.
Oper1 (X)              CausFunc0 (X)3.
FinOper1 (X)         LiquFunc0 (X)Table 1.
False homonymy correspondences in theEnglish languageAll the examples in this section were given forthe English language.
The fact is that for themajority of their translation equivalents inRussian the situation is the same ?
being non-homonymous they can be described with the helpof two lexical functions (the same ones as theirEnglish equivalents).So, table 1 can be transformed into thefollowing one:               L1            L24.
IncepOper1 (X)     CausFunc0 (X)5.
Oper1 (X)              CausFunc0 (X)6.
FinOper1 (X)         LiquFunc0 (X)Table 2.
False homonymy correspondences5So, there are a lot of word-combinations inboth languages that have only one meaning butcan be described with the help of two differentlexical functions.
This fact is interesting from thepoint of view of theoretical semantics, but itcauses difficulties for a machine translationsystem.For simplification of the situation in(Andreyeva, 2007) I propose to use only one ofthese lexical-functional descriptions in everycase.
It is a good decision for every word-combination in particular, but being implementedfor the system in general it still causesdifficulties.The fact is that the number of these word-combinations is quite big.
The ETAP-3 system isdeveloped by many linguists and it is changed allthe time.
In the cases described in this sectionthere is no or nearly no difference between themeanings of lexical functions in the pairs, soeach of these LFs can be chosen for thedescription of a word-combination.
It isimpossible to guarantee that the same functionswill be chosen to describe translation equivalents.Besides, there can be a slight difference betweenthe meanings of equivalents in two languages,and different functions can seem preferable for5L1 and L2 can be both the Russian and the Englishlanguages.their description.
If different lexical functions areused to describe translation equivalents, theinformation about their equivalency will be lost.To avoid such a situation and to be free tochoose the best corresponding lexical functionfor the description of an LF construction withouttaking into consideration the material of the otherlanguage it seems reasonable to add special rulesto the ETAP-3 system.
These rules allow toreplace the value of a lexical function from thepair not only with the value of the same functionbut also with the value of the other LF from thesame pair.
The technique of this replacement isdescribed in section 4.3 Real lexical-functionalcorrespondencesIn the introduction there was given the generaldefinition of lexical function given by Mel?uk.According to it, to be regarded as an argument ofthe LF and a value of given LF for the sameargument, two words must have a certaincorrelation between their meanings.
But themajority of definitions of concrete lexicalfunctions include not only semantic, but alsosyntactic conditions: to have a right to be calledan argument of the LF and a value of given LFfor the same argument, two words must also beconnected by a certain syntactic link.All the pairs of corresponding lexical functionsin section 2 have differences in the semantic partsof their definitions, but the syntactic parts areabsolutely identical.
If they were not, it would beimpossible to use these pairs for the descriptionof the same constructions.But it has already been mentioned that thereasons of adding these correspondences to thesystem of machine translation are mainlytechnical.
What is really important for the systemis the possibility to establish correspondencesbetween different word-combinations, amongwhich one can be described only with the help oflexical function lf1, and the other one representsonly lexical function lf2.Actually, such correspondences have alreadybeen described and implemented in the system ofmachine translation ETAP-3.
See, for example,(Apresjan, Tsinman, 2002), where several dozensof such correspondences are listed, includingquite rare ones.
But the majority of thesecorrespondences were used only in theparaphrasing block of the system, i.e.
a blockresponsible for paraphrasing of sentences of onelanguage only.
As far as translation is concerned,66only a few LF correspondences wereimplemented in the translation process.This section shows which real LFcorrespondences can be found between theRussian and the English languages and how theycan be used to improve translation process.3.1 LF correspondences typesIt happens quite often that in one of the describedlanguages X1+Y1 form an LF construction (withX1 as an argument and Y1 as a value of the LFlf1), and the translation equivalent of X1+Y1 inthe other language represents some other lexicalfunction.
Sometimes it is X2+Y2 (with X2 as atranslation equivalent of X1 and Y2 as a value ofLF lf2 for X2), but it also happens that it is Y2only.In some cases such correspondences representsystem differences in strategies two languagesuse.
In these cases the same correspondencedescribes large groups of word-combinations.
Inother cases the correspondences are not causedby system differences, but nevertheless can beused for the processing of big groups ofconstructions.
There are also situations when LFcorrespondences are specific for small groups ofconstructions.3.2 System differencesFunc - OperThis subsection describes not a pair, but a wholeclass of lexical functions dealing with the idea ofpossession (in its widest meaning, of course).It is common knowledge that Russian belongsto so-called ?be-languages?, and English is a?have-language?.
These characteristics of thelanguages could not help influencing the sphereof lexical functions describing possession.Of course, both Russian and English haveFunc and Oper LF constructions of differenttypes.
But in the Russian language the number ofLF constructions of Func type is approximatelytwo times bigger than in the English language.
Inthe majority of cases, if a Russian LFconstruction of the Func type cannot betranslated into English with the help of the sameLF, an Oper correspondence can be found.This principle can be illustrated by thefollowing list of corresponding pairs of lexicalfunctions:        Russian          English1.
Func1 (X)              Oper1 (X)2.
IncepFunc1 (X)     IncepOper1 (X)3.
FinFunc1 (X)         FinOper1 (X)4.
Func2 (X)              Oper2 (X)Table 3.
Some correspondences of Func type andOper type lexical functionsHere are some illustrations for LFcorrespondences from table 3.

hang over)Examples (3)-(6) show pairs of translationequivalents among which the Russian one is anargument of the Func type lexical function fromthe corresponding pair of LFs and is not anargument of the LF of Oper type; on the otherhand, the English word is an argument of theOper type LF and is not an argument of the Functype one.In the process of translation word-combinations formed by these arguments of LFsand values of these LFs for these arguments arereplaced with each other.
Translation equivalentsfor the material from examples (3)-(6) are thefollowing:(3a) Ego glojet toska.
 He is feeling boredom.
(4a) U nego skladivajetsja vpechatlenije, chto... He is gaining an impression that?
(5a) Nasmork u nego proshel.
 He shook offthe cold.
(6a) Nad nim navisla ugroza iskluchenija.
He bore the threat of exclusion.6cold3 ?
a disease67Technical aspects of implementation of LFcorrespondences described in this section aregiven in section 4.Nouns and gerundsAnother system difference between the Englishand the Russian languages that turns out to beimportant for the use of lexical functions in thetranslation process is the difference betweenforms Russian and English verbs have.
In theEnglish language there exists a verb form calledgerund which has no analogues in Russian.The way this difference influences the domainof LF constructions is the following.
Amonglexical functions a lot (more than a nundred) havenouns as their arguments and verbs (sometimesaccompanied by prepositions or adverbs) as theirvalues.
For example, all LFs mentioned abovebelong to this group.Many of these verbs form verbal nouns whichin the majority of cases inherit the meaning of theverbs.
Therefore, if a verb V is a value of lexicalfunction lf1 for the argument X (lf1(X) = V), andV forms a verbal noun NV, in the majority ofcases there will be the same semantic correlationbetween X and V, on one hand, and X and NV, onthe other hand.But syntactic links between a verb and a noun(X+V) and a noun and a noun (X+NV) are ofcourse different, so word-combinations formedby two nouns cannot be described as representingthe same lexical functions as word-combinationsformed by a noun and a verb.This problem was solved by making a specialgroup of lexical functions for the description ofword-combinations formed by a verbal noun andanother noun.
If lf1(X) = V, and semanticcorrelation between the meanings of V and X andof NV and X is the same, then NV = S0_lf1 (X).For example, see (7).
(7) IncepOper1 (compromise) = arrive atS0_IncepOper1 (compromise) = arrival atLexical-functional constructions of S0_lf typeexist both in the Russian and the Englishlanguages, but their number is bigger in Russian.The reason for this seems to be the fact that theEnglish language has gerund which can be usedin a function of a noun.
Russian has no verb formof this kind.
So, it has to form verbal nounswhich are actually formed quite freely.
English,being able to use gerunds in many constructions,does not need such a big number of verbal nouns.The result of this difference is that in manycases Russian LF word-combination representinga lexical function of S0_lf type corresponds tothe English construction with gerund.
In ordernot to lose the information about lexical-functional correspondences it is possible toestablish the following correlation:S0_lf (in Russian) ?
lf (in English) (gerund)Such a correspondence can be established forall (or nearly all) the lexical functions of S0_lftype.
The article is too small to list them all7, soonly several examples are given:Russian          ?
English1.
S0_Oper1 (X)           ?

going in for sports(9a) dostijenije soglashenija ?
arriving at anagreement(10a) uhod iz biznesa ?
going out of business7There are more then 100 LF of S0_lf type in the ETAP-3system.683.3 Other differencesLexical-functional correspondences described inthe previous section are the result of systemdifferences between the Russian and the Englishlanguages.
This section is devoted to LFcorrespondences which are not caused bydifference in strategies these languages use, butwhich are still applicable to large amount ofword-combinations.These LF correspondences consist of functionsfrom Func group.Lexical functions of Func type include, amongothers, Func0 and Func1.
Func0 describessituations when X takes place, Func1 describessituations when X takes place forsomething/somebody or characterizessomething/somebody (X is an argument of LFand a grammatical subject, something/somebodyis a principal complement)8.There are a lot of cases when a word in one ofthe languages (X1) is an argument of Func1, andits translation equivalent in the other language(X2) is an argument of Func0 and is not anargument of Func1.In such cases the result of the translationwould be much better if we replace the value ofFunc1 for X1 with the value of Func0 for X2than if we replace it with the trivial translationequivalent of X1.
So, there can be established thefollowing lexical-functional correspondence:Func1?Func0.It is important to note that, unlike all the other?real?
LF correspondences described above, thiscorrespondence works in both Russian-Englishand English-Russian translation.Here is the example for the described LFcorrespondence:(11) Func0 (anger) = reignFunc1 (gnev) = vladet?
(gnev ?
anger, vladet?
?
possess)Im vladeet gnev.
?
Anger reigns.There is one more reason for the establishmentof Func1?Func0 LF correspondence.
A lot ofwords are arguments of both Func0 and Func1.But in many cases information about one of theselinks is not yet included in the system by mistake,or by chance, or because of the lack of time.
Inthis case Func1?Func0 correspondence works asa technical one, not being able to provide the best8These definitions of lexical functions were created byJu.D.
Apresjan (Apresjan, Tsinman, 2002).translation result, but making it as good aspossible.Func1?Func0 is not the only lexical-functional correspondence of Func type.
OtherLF correspondences for lexical functions of Funcgroup can be established.
This is the list of them:L1          ?

(14a) Eto vyzyvajet vozmuschenije u vseh.
?This arouses everybody?s indignation.
(15a) Eto podryvajet doverije ludej.
?It shatters people?s confidence.3.4 Rare correspondencesDespite the differences, all lexical-functionalcorrespondences described above have onecommon feature: they take a word-combination69X1+lf1(X1) and transform it into a word-combination X2+lf2(X2).But the situation is not always that simple.
Letus look at the following examples:(16)  carry convinction(17)  privodit?
v izumlenije9(18)  prihodit?
v izumlenijeAll the examples (16)-(18) represent differentlexical functions.
(16a) CausFunc0 (conviction) = carry(17a) CausOper1 (izumlenije) = privodit?
(18a) IncepOper1 (izumlenije) = prihodit?
(izumlenije ?
astonishment)(prihodit?
?
come, privodit?
?
lead)The fact is that none of the examples (16)-(18)can be translated with the help of any of LFcorrespondences described above in this article.These word-combinations are transformed in theprocess of translation into one verb.
Fortunatelythis verb is a value of CausV0 for the translationequivalent of X1, so it is possible to establish thefollowing LF correspondences:L1            ?

to be astonished4 Mechanism of translationIn sections 2 and 3 different types of lexical-functional correspondences were described.
Thischapter shows how the use of these LFcorrespondences is realised in the system ofmachine translation ETAP-3.
?Linguistically, ETAP-3 consists of varioussets of rules and dictionaries?
All the rules ?are subdivided into three main types: (i) generalrules that apply to all the sentences in the course9Russian examples (17) and (18) will be translated below.of their processing; (ii) class-specific rules thathold for compact groups of words and arereferred to by their names in the dictionaryentries of the respective items; (iii) word-specificrules that are characteristic of individual lexicalitems and are stored directly in their dictionaryentries.
The second and third types of rules areactivated only on condition that the processedsentence contains the relevant lexical items.?
(Apresjan et al 2003).
As for general rules, it isimportant to note that they work one afteranother, in the fixed order, so the order they arelisted in the system is very important.To implement the above-described lexical-functional correlations we have to include theminto the system in a form of translation rules.
Itmeans two main problems to be solved:1) what type these rules must belong to,2) if they are general, what their order must be.As for the type, the decision seems to be thefollowing: all the correspondences except onesfrom section 3.4 (rare correspondences) mustbecome general rules, and those from 3.4 mustbecome class-specific ones.
The latter are veryrare and can be implemented, perhaps, only forseveral words each.
There is no use in makingthem general, and they must not be word-specific, too, because they describe groups ofconstructions, not singular cases.
So, class-specific type is ideal for them.All the other types of LF correspondencesdescribed above are worth being implementedwith the help of general rules.
First, they describebig groups of constructions.
Second and the mostimportant is the reason for they usage: we needthem to work automatically in case the main ruleof translation with the help of a lexical function(described in the introduction) does not work,and the only way to provide this is to make themgeneral.As these correspondences are implementedwith the help of general rules, it is very importantto put them into the proper order.
I would like topropose the following one.1) The first rule in the list of rules responsiblefor the translation with the help of LFs is ofcourse the main rule described inintroduction.
All the other rules can workonly in case the first one did not work.
So,the first rule is:lf1 (X) ?
lf1 (X)702) The second block of rules is the blockresponsible for Func-Oper correspondences.In case the general rule does not work thisblock provides the most correct translationequivalents.
So, the second block is:        Russian          English1.
Func1 (X)              Oper1 (X)2.
IncepFunc1 (X)     IncepOper1 (X)3.
FinFunc1 (X)         FinOper1 (X)4.
Func2 (X)              Oper2 (X)The order of rules inside this block (as well asinside all the other blocks) is not of greatimportance.
It can be the same as in the table.3) The third block is the one responsible forcorrespondences of Func type.L1          ?
L21.
Func1 (X)             ?
Func0 (X)2.
IncepFunc1 (X)    ?
IncepFunc0 (X)3.
FinFunc1 (X)      ?
FinFunc0 (X)4.
CausFunc1 (X)     ?
CausFunc0 (X)5.
LiquFunc1 (X)     ?
LiquFunc0 (X)It is very important for the third block to beimplemented only after the second one, becausethere are lexical functions both blocks work with(Func1, IncepFunc1, and FincFunc1).
If it isimpossible to replace the value of one of thesefunctions with the value of the same one, wemust first try to replace it with its Operequivalent and only in case it is impossible passto Func0 correspondence.
Oper equivalent isbetter than Func0 one because the former allowsto preserve the information about all the actantsof the verb ?
value of an LF, while the latter losesthe information about one of the actants.4) The fourth block is the one transformingnouns into gerunds.Russian          ?
English1.
S0_Oper1 (X)           ?
Oper1 (X)(gerund)2.
S0_IncepOper1 (X)  ?
IncepOper1 (X)(gerund)3.
S0_FinOper1 (X)      ?
FinOper1 (X)(gerund)As for the order of the third and the fourthblocks, they do not interfere with each other so itis of no importance which one is the first.
Theonly problem is that in reality the fourth block isvery big (it includes the majority of LFs of S0_lftype), so it is just more convenient to have it afterthe third block.5) And the last one is the block responsible forfalse homonymy correspondences.This block was created ?just in case?, so it isworth being placed at the end of the list.
Besides,it works with Oper functions of different types,so in any case it must be placed after the secondblock.This block causes one additional problem.
Ifwe list all its correspondences in one column, wewill see that CausFunc0 can become both Oper1and IncepOper1.
Establishment of both of theserules in the system will not improve thetranslation but will produce plenty of wrongtranslation variants.
As the rules of this block arenot of great importance, it seems better not to usethese two problem rules at all.
So, this block willbe the following:L1           ?
L21.
IncepOper1 (X)    ?
CausFunc0 (X)2.
Oper1 (X)             ?
CausFunc0 (X)3.
FinOper1 (X)        ?
LiquFunc0 (X)4.
LiquFunc0 (X)     ?
FinOper1 (X)In the majority of cases the transformation ofone LF construction into the other one entailschanges in syntactic roles of actants.
Informationabout these changes is also included into therules.5 ConclusionThe paper described different types of lexical-functional correspondences between the Russianand the English languages.
It showed how theinformation about LF links included in thedictionaries and translation rules of machinetranslation system ETAP-3 allowed to considerthese correspondences in the process oftranslation and thus to improve its results.ReferencesAndreyeva, A.S. 2007.
