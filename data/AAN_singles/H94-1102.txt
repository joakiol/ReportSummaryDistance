A key com-plementary objective is to define and develop applicationsof robust speech recognition and understanding systems, andto help catalyze the transition of spoken language technologyinto military and civilian systems, with particular focus onapplication of robust CSR to mobile military command andcontrol.
The research effort focusses on developing advancedacoustic modelling, rapid search, and recognition-time adap-tation techniques for robust large-vocabulary CSR, and onapplying these techniques to the new ARPA large-vocabularyCSR corpora and to military application tasks.BACKGROUNDThe Lincoln program began with s focus on improvingspeaker stress robustness for the fighter aircraft environ-ment.
A robust HMM isolated-word recognizer (IWR) wasdeveloped with very high performance under stress condi-tions.
The robust HMM techniques were then developedand extended to large-vocabulary CSR with state-of-the-artperformance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) tasks on the ARPA resource management(RM) database.More recently, the HMM CSR has been extended to taskswith much larger vocabularies (5,000 - 64,000 words) andhigher perplexities (50 - 250) with focus on the Wall StreetJournal (WSJ) corpus.
Improved acoustic modelling tech-niques for the tied-mixture CSR have been developed andapplied, including multiple observation streams, semiphonemodels, sex- dependent acoustic models, cross-word triphonemodels, and improved duration modelling.
For the large-vocabulary tasks, the Lincoln HMM CSR has been con-verted to use a stack decoder search algorithm with inte-grated acoustic fast match and detailed match algorithms.
