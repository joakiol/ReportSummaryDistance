i lAbstractHebrew ?includes a very productive noun-compounding construction called smixut.
Becausesmixut is marked morphologically and is restricted by many syntactic onstraints, it has beenthe focus of many descriptive studies in Hebrew grammar.We present he treatment of smixut in HUGG, a FUF-based syntactic realization systemcapable of producing complex noun phrases in Hebrew.
We contrast he treatment of smixutwith noun-compounding in English and illustrate the potential for paraphrasing it introduces.We Specifically address the issue of determining when a smixut construction can be gener-ated as opposed to other semantically equivalent constructs.
We investigate several competinghypotheses - smixut is lexically, semantically and/or pragmatically determined.
For each hy:pothesis, we explain why the decision to produce a smixut construction cannot be reduced to acomputation Over features produced by an outside module that Would not need to know aboutthe smixut phenomenon.We conclude that smixut provides yet another theoretical example where the interface thata syntactic realization component presents to the other components of a generation architecturecannot be made as isolated as we would hope.
While the syntactic onstraints on smixut areencapsulated within HUGG, the input Specification language to HUGG must contain a featurethat specifies that smixut is requested if possible.?
However, because smixut accounts for close to half the cases of NP modifiers observedon a corpus of complex NPs, and it ?appears to be the unmarked realization form for somefrequent semantic relations, we empirically evaluate a default setting strategy for the featureuse-smixut based on a simple semantic Classification of the relations head-modifier in the NP.This study provides a Solid ground for the definition of a small set of predicates in the inputspecification language to HUGG, that has applications beyond the selection of smixut - -  forthe determination of the order of modifiers in the NP and the use of stacking vs. conjunction- -and  for the definition of a bilingual input specification language.1 Introduct ionOver the past three years,?
we have started developing HUGG, a syntactic realization component forHebrew.
One of our objectives is to  investigate constraints on the design of the input specificationlanguage to a syntactic realization component hrough a contrastive analysis of the requirementsof English and Hebrew.
By design, we are attempting to keep the input to HUGG as similaras possible to  the one we defined in the SURGE syntactic realization for English \[7\].
A detailed168ImUmI!
!llI!analysis of syntactic onstructs specific to Hebrew becomes, therefore, critical to evaluate to whichextent he input specification language can abstract away from knowledge of the syntax.We investigate in this paper one such construct: the Hebrew noun-compounding form knownas srnixut.
Because smixut is morphologically marked and remarkably productive in Hebrew, thereexists a vast tradition of work in descriptive grammar of Hebrew providing functional analysisof the phenomenon \[11\] [10\] [13\].
This previous work has served as a fertile ground for our owngeneration-specific purposes.The specific issue we discuss in this paper is: what information in the input specification tothe syntactic realization component can license the selection of a smixut construct.
The classicalobjectives of modularity and knowledge ncapsulation indicate that this decision should be a privatedecision of the syntactic realization component.
Because there are so many syntactic onstraintson the use of smixut, the objective of encapsulation is made even more desirable.After a thorough analysis of the different functions of the smixut construct and the constraintsover  its use, our conclusion, however, is that this reductionist rategy fails: we cannot explain theselection of a smixut construct without considering simultaneously lexical, semantic and pragmaticfactors.Theoretically, in order to allow the syntactic realization component to select a smixut constructadequately, we are, therefore, left with two options: (1) either provide full, detailed access from thesyntactic realization component to the complex semantic and pragmatic features that can impact onthe decision; or else, (2) allow the other components o request he use of a smixut construct whenthey deem it adequate.
In either case, modularity and encapsulation suffer.
This analysis informsus in our design of a bilingual realization component: if a feature like use-smixut is required inthe input to the syntactic omponent, his level of abstraction cannot be appropriate as a bilingualconstruction.
It also informs us in the general ongoing debate over the design of reusable syntacticcomponents and their place in the architecture of generators.From a more pragmatic perspective, however, we also provide a set of simple defaults for thegeneration of smixut based on a simple semantic lassification of the relations head-modifier.
Weevaluate the validity of this classification by constructing input specifications for a corpus of morethan 800 comp!ex, noun phrases and regenerating from them.
The validation process includes twoaspects: (1) we test that human coders agree on the semantic relations they use to label complexNPs; and (2) we verify that the generator's decision to produce a smixut construction correspondsto that observed in the corpus.
Preliminary results are provided in Section 4.3.
They encourage usto view in the set of semantic relations we propose a useful basis for the design of an interlingualinput specification language.In the rest of the paper, we first briefly review the main approaches to the treatment of noun-compounds in English and in Hebrew.
In Section 3 we provide descriptive data on the use of smixutin Hebrew.
We then describe in Section 4 a first approach to the generation of smixut based on asimple semantic lassification similar to that found in \[12\].
In Section 5, we identify the limitationsof such an approach, illustrating that an explanation based on recoverable s mantic relations cannotprovide sufficient nor necessary conditions for the generation of smixut.
However, the preliminaryempirical evaluation we present in Section 4.3 demonstrates that the semantic relation approachprovides a useful default hat works "most of the time.
"1692 Prev iOus Work2.1  Noun compounds  in Eng l i shNoun compounds in English axe partly "frozen" lexical constructions (e.g., computer science) andpartly compositional constructions (e.g., computer equipment, farm equipment, city equipment...).The problematic aspect of this construction is that it seems to be very productive in English, butyet severely constrained (e.g., * science equipment).
Compound constructions are also regularlyambiguous.The various approaches developed to explain the construction of noun compounds and theirinterpretation can be classified in three groups: semantic, pragmatic, and statistical/lexical.?
Semantic theories explain the production of a noun compound N1 N2 as a derivation from asemantic relation N1 R NP where the relation ?
R is elided.
The theory of recoverably deletablepredicates (RDPs) Of \[!2\] proposes that  only a small set of relations (canse, have, make...) canparticipate in this process.
Because these relations were too general and sometimes vague, andbecause one can observe many cases of compounds that do not correspond to any of the proposedRDPs, others have proposed to define more precise domain specific models to explain the deletionof certain relations.Recognizing the importance of contextual factors, pragmatic theories predict the use of nouncompounding when relations like naming or contrast play a role \[6\].
For example, when referringto two persons wearing a jacket and a Coat respectively, one can use compounds like the jacketman and the coat man even though, in neutral contexts, it would be difficult to interpret he samecompound (i.e., the wear relation is not deletable).In \[5\], the explanation for compounding is provided in the form of lexical/syntactic knowledge.Generative devices inspired by \[14\] are found in the lexicon.
In addition, statistical knowledgepredicts which derivations are the most likely.From a generation perspective, the problem is less acute than for interpretation: we must decidewhether to construct a compound as opposed to recover the missing relation between the head andthe modifier.
The problem has, therefore,?
not received heavy attention for English generation.
Inthe past, we used Levi's model in generation \[8\], but as part of the lexical chooser, and we did notinclude it within th e syntactic realization component.In Hebrew, however, the smixut Construction is extremely productive (in our corpus, smixutmodification accounts for 40% of all modifiers, more than any other type of syntactic modification ?in NPs).
We, therefore, had to address the issue of when to generate smixut as a priority in thedevelopment of the NP grammar for HUGG.2.2 Noun compounds  in HebrewThe structure of noun compounds in Hebrew - smixut, is marked and, therefore, it has been thefocus of Hebrew language studies.
The head (called nismax) is marked morphologically and it doesnot carry a mark of definiteness even when it is semantically definite.
\[!
0\] \[2\] provide detailedstudies of the syntactic onstraints on the use of smixut.
We provide an overview of the mainconstraints in Section 3.Although smixut is traditionally treated as a possessive construction, it can express many otherrelations between head and modifier.
Levi \[11\] has extended her treatment of the noun-noun relationin English \[12\] and proposed that the same semantic relations can all be expressed by the Hebrewsmixut construction.
\[2\] and \[10\] (Chapter 6) also )rovide similar semantic lassifications of the170elided relation in a smixut.
We build on these studies in our implementation, but also investigatehow a semantic account can be integrated with pragmatic and lexical constraints,3 Noun Compounds in Hebrew: ConstraintsWe briefly present in this section the basic syntactic onstraints over the use of smixut in Hebrew.The notion of "smixut" covers three main constructions: \[2\] \[10\]\[p24\]:compound separate  const ruct  doub le -gen i t ivecadur ha-tinok ha-cadur Sel ha-tinok cadur-o Sel ha-tinokball the-baby the ball of the baby ball-his of the-babySmixut is identified by two main tests: first, when plural is used, only the head is markedmorphologically with a special inflection: yeled (child - singular) vs. yelad-im (children - pluralnon-smixut) vs. yald~ei (children - plural head of smixut marking).Second, when definite is used, only the modifier is marked even though the head is understood asdefinite: aron 'mitbax (cabinet kitchen) (a kitchen cabinet) vs. aron ha-mitbax (cabinet he-kitchen)(the kitchen cabinet).Nominalizations are also built using a smixut construction with a gerund or a denominal ashead:Bo ha-role Bo 'o Sel ha-role The arrival of the doctor: Arrive the-doctor Arrive=his of the-doctorWe categorize the constraints on the use of smixut in four categories: yntactic, lexical, semanticand pragmatic.3.1 Syntact i c  Const ra in tsOne of the main constraints on the use?
of smixut is that a head can have only one noun modifier(called somex in Hebrew).
When several modifiers are attached to a head, this constraint forcesother relations to be realized in other syntactic onstructions (post-modifier adjective, prepositionalphrase or relative clause).
For example, when referring to a suit made of leather, the defaultrealization (unmarked) is the smixut beged wor (suit-leather).
The alternative realization begedme-wor (suit from-leather) with a qualifier PP is also possible, but less frequent.
However, whenreferring to a bathing-suit in  leather 1 the default realization is beged-yam e-wor (suit-sea from-leather).
Because the somex (noun modifier) position of the head beged is occupied by the yam(sea) modifier, the second modifier ?
(leather) is relegated to another (not nominal) position.The head of a smixut must be a noun or a conjunction of nouns and it cannot be a compounditself.
This means that smixut only allows right branching 2.
This is in contrast with English,which allows right or left branching constructions: (computer communication) system vs. computer(communication system).Pronouns and proper nouns cannot head a smixut, and any pronoun in the modifier position'has the objective case and is agglutinated to the noun: ben-o son-him (his son).There are several restrictions on the combination ?of smixut with different determiner types.Noun phrases in Hebrew are polydefinite - -  that is, definiteness i marked on several of the con-stituents in the phrase.
Any adjectival modifier is marked with agglutinated efinite markers, thesame as the head noun.
Quantifiers and determiners can be also marked.
In smixut, only the1Very frequent on Israeli beaches.2That is, if Hebrew is written left to right.171mod-n is marked as definite.
Therefore, compounded nouns are understood as having the samedefiniteness value.
As a consequence, if definiteness of the head and modifier differs, smixut cannotbe reed:head-N + mod-N definite(The son of the king)ben ha-melexson the-kingben-o Sei ha-rnelexson-his of the-kinghead-N + mod-N indefinite ben me/ex ben Seg raelez(a son of a king) son king son of kinghead-N indefinite, mod-N definite benSeI ha-rnelez(a son of the king) son of  the kinghead-N definite, mod-N indefinite ben-o Sel melex(The son of a king) son-his of king3.2 Lex ica l  Const ra in tsNot every noun can head a smixut construction: words which are lexical-compounds (cadur-sal -ball-basket - basketball), words of foreign origin, cannot be in nismaz form (i. e. the special inflectionof compound nouns), and therefore any modifiers must be realized in another syntactic onstruction.Several criteria exist to distinguish frozen fromproductive smixut compounds: frozen com-pounds behave like regular smixut with-respect to plural marking (special morphology inflection).But depending on the level of cohesiveness of the frozen compound, definite marking may differ:beyt-sefer -house-book - (a school) may give ha-beyt-sefer (the school) instead of the predicted beytha-sefer for a productive smixut.In addition, for frozen constructs, many additional constraints exist: the head cannot be mod-ified (* beyt sefer kri'a - house book reading), cannot change its number (* beyt sfar-ym -housebooks), cannot be taken apart ( * bayt Sel sefer - house of book) or be?conjoined to another somex(noun modifier) (beyt sefer ve beyt Hol-im - house book and house patient-s - a school and hospitalbut * beyt sefer ve-Hol-im - house book and patient-s).
Detailed references from linguistic andsociolinguistic aspects are found in \[4\] and \[3\] respectively.?
3.3 Semant ic  Const ra in tsSmixut is often understood as a genitive type of construct, expressing dominantly a possessiverelation between the head and the modifier.
Very often, however, the relation expressed is not oneof possession.The semantic relation realized by the smixut has an influence on the possible paraphrases thesmixut can receive \[2\]: some semantic relations (including possessive) can be realized in a doublegenitive construction while others can only be realized by a simple smixut.
The semantic relationalso determines which types of modifiers can be accepted in the smixut construction.
In general,when a double genitive construction is not possible, then pronouns cannot appear as modifiers,even in a simple smixut.In the case of gerunds, the only possible structures are compound and double-genitive while theseparate construction is not possible.Levi \[11\] claims that smixut realizes in Hebrew a number of universal semantic processes whichexist inother languages, thus extending her original analysis for English \[12\].
Her ':non predicativemodifiers" theory claims that  Noun-noun compounding is produced by two ?syntactic processes:nominalization or deletion of the predicate : which corresponds to the observed uses of smixut forpossessive and gerund constructions.Azar \[2\] classifies mixut into 15 semantic ategories.
This classification can be made parallelto Levi's RDPs.
Glinert \[10\] also refers to such a classification i  a similar manner.172,III1i lI;I3.4 P ragmat ic  Const ra in tsThere are cases, however, when smixut can be constructed with no regard to the semantic set thatwas identified.
Certain contexts license smixut constructions that would not be obtained otherwise- for example, contrast or naming \[6\].In addition, smixut is associated with style and genre parameters.
Seikevicz \[16\] analyzestranscripts of spoken Hebrew, and finds that smixut is used when using a 'Sel' preposition is notpossible.Other pragmatic onsiderations for the use of smixut include the objective to generate a morecompact ext and to make of a compound an item available for further anaphorical reference.Finally, decision to compound a head with a plural or singular modifier is related to the gener-icity of the description and to the habituality of the relation,.as i the case in English \[15\] (p. 916):The table in the corner was laid for dinner The corner tableThe girl in the corner spoke to me ~ The corner girl4 When Can ?
Smixut  Be  Generated?Our main objective is to determine what features must be present in the input to the syntacticrealization component to decide when to use a smixut construction.We observe that the ?production of smixut is semantically constrained, and that the semanticrelation holding between head and modifiers determines which syntactic paraphrases are possible(among smixut, double-genitive and separate construct).
A set of semantic predicates imilar toLevi's RDPs seems to play a role in the decision.
On the other hand, being a member of that setis not a sufficient nor necessary condition to generate a smixut.In  the SURGE grammar for English, we did not address this decision, and assume that theinput includes a predefined syntactic onstruction (classifier-head).
For Hebrew, we must find analternative approach because: (1) smixut is extremely frequent (40~0 of the noun modifiers in ourcorpus); (2) smixut is the default realization for many relations but it cannot be used in manysyntactic ontexts.4.1 Exp lo i t ing  a Semant ic  C lass i f i ca t ionOur strategy is to provide in the input to HUGG a reliable default indicating that smixut shouldbe used when possible, but making it possible to fall back on an alternative realization (separateor double genitive, or qualifier modification) when smixut is not possible.For instance, lexical-compounds cannot be head a smixut, and, therefore, their modifier mustbe realized as a PP.
The same semantic relation (e.g., material) will be realized in two differentways depending on the lexical property of the  head:coat leather head I lex "mewyl" \]leather coat modifiers \[ material \[ lax "wor" \] \]If the same input is provided, but the property of the head noun is different, a different Con-struction will be generated:bathing-suit ?from-leather head lax "beged-yam" ?
cat noun-compoundleather bathing-suit modifiers \[ material \[ lax "wor" \] \]173A similar mechanism would determine that a smixut is not possible if the definiteness of thehead and the modifier do.not match, as discussed above in the a son o.f the king example.The syntactic realizer also relies on the semantic lassification of the relation head-modifier whenseveral modifiers are attached to a single head.
In this case, only a single modifier can be realized asa smixut.
The others must be realized differently.
In this case, the realizer must determine whichrelation takes priority to become the smixut, and it must also provide an appropriate paraphrasefor the non-smixut modifier.For example, the English NP leather house shoe will be generated in one of the following ways: 3nawal bayit me-wor cat commonhouse shoe ~om-leather lex ~nawal"shoe leather .for-the-house purpose lex "bayit" \]Beyond smixut-related decisions, determining a set of semantic relations is also useful to allowHUGG to determine appropriate defaults for prepositions in PP modifiers.
For example, in theexample above, HUGG can select the default preposition .for in shoe \]or the house because therelation of purpose is specified.The same classification is also useful to determine the order and the syntactic structure of a' multi-modifier sequence in complex NPs.In general, when several modifiers attach to a single head, a broken (conjuncted) sequence iscreated \[9\] (in contrast o English, where a stacking construction is generally used): .4 big whitehouse vs. bayit gadol ve-lavan (house big and white).However, when adjectives realize a semantic relation that could have been reaiized by a smixut,they appear first in  the sequence of modifiers and they do not require a conjunction \[1\].cat commonmakdeHa HaSmalyt gadola lex "makdeHa" In a large electronic drill modifiers lex "HaSmaly"size lex "gadol" \]In this example, makdeHa HaSmalyt gadola is produced instead of * makdeha gadola ve-HaSmalyt because the electric modifier ealizes the smixut-licensing relation of ins t rument .
Thisphenomenon gives a further justification for the use of semantic relations in the input.4.2  Class i f i ca t ion  o f  Semant ic  Re la t ionsSince the syntactic realization component can make good use of a semantic lassification in theinput, we have designed the classification shown in Table 1, which synthesizes the lists provided byLevi, Glinert and Azar.In the table we present a basic list of relations with its occurrence percentage in our corpus.It can be viewed that some relations are much more productive than others - purpose, has-part.Our classification is finer than Levi's in distinguishing for example among different ypes of typicalpossessive relations (human-relator, has-part and ownership).
This reflects slight differences in thedefault way of generation.
Human-relator, for instance, is used as construct when the modifier is apronoun, more often than with other ownership relations.3VVe discuss below the heuristics HUGG uses to decide between these 2 paraphrases.?

For each NP, we labeled the relations head-modifier in terms of the relations listed inTable 1.Our evaluation covers two aspects: we first verify that human coders agree on the labeling; wethen verify that HUGG can generate from a labeled input a realization similar to that observed inthe corpus.Preliminary evaluation of the agreement among human judges shows agreement of about 90%between three judges (we are currently extending the number of judges).
The percentage agreementincludes a category "undecided" which covers about 5% of the cases.
This corresponds to caseswhere judges found the relation ambiguous or unclear.
Judges agreed on the labeling of unclearrelations.In our corpus, we observed the following distribution in terms of syntactic realization (this takesinto account NPs with more than one modifier, explaining that the sum is > 100%):175139% Ismixut 131% \]Pp-qualifier I34% describer 8% relative clauseWhen regenerating from the labeled input we have determined, I-IUGG's decision to generatea smixut corresponded to that observed in the corpus on more than 95% of the cases.5 L imi ta t ions  o f  a Semant ic  AccountWhile the semantic account described above provides good results, it cannot be the only mechanismlicensing the production of smixut.
We discuss in this section the type of interaction that must beallowed between discourse and pragmatic parameters and the syntactic realization component.In \[5\], the interaction between lexical semantics and pragmatics i  explored, and two axiomsare proposed to interface between the defaults of the lexical semantic and the arbitrary knowledgeof pragmatics: (1) defaults urvive and (2) discourse wins.
A statistical method is then added inOrder to resolve possible interpretations.
It isassumed, then, that the grammar/lexicon delimitsthe range of compounds and indicates conventional interpretations, but that some compounds mayonly be resolved by pragmatics and that non-conventional contextual interpretations are alwaysavailable.
To provide interpretations , a general schema is encoded in the lexicon leaving undecidablecases to be resolved by pragmatics.
Probabilities of possible interpretations are taken from corpusfrequencies.
Accordingly, a new rule is added: (3) Prefer Frequent Senses, which can still beoverridden by contextual factors.From the generation perspective, the interaction between discourse licensed-relations and con-ventional readings must similarly be controlled by preference rules.For example, when referring to a city destroyed by the Barbarian, discourse readings cannotoverride the conventional reading in  The Barbarian city: discourse cannot force the reading of acity destroyed by the Barbarians.This indicates that a non-monotonic form of reasoning, taking into account preference rulessimilar to that identified in \[5\] must be implemented at the pragmatic level.
Clearly, this typeof reasoning does not belong within the syntactic realization component.
Therefore, we concludethat the feature use-smixut remains a necessary part of the input specification language to thesyntactic realization component.6 Conc lus ionWe have presented in this paper basic data on the Hebrew smixut construction.
Our strategy toimplement smixut in the HUGG syntactic realization is to provide a simple semantic lassificationin the input.
We have demonstrated the many benefits this classification has within the realizationprocess.Two main problems have been traditionally associated with such semantic accounts of noun-compounding: the relations are not well-defined enough and they are not necessary nor sufficientto explain all uses of compounding.
We address these two problems in  three ways: (1) we providean empirical evaluation demonstrating high coder agreement when labeling complex NPs with theset of relations we identify; (2) we demonstrate empirically that the default strategy of "generatinga smixut when a semantic relation licenses it" corresponds with the observed usage of smixut inmore than 95% of the cases; and (3) we allow the pragmatic module to add a feature use-smixutin the input.176III!!!!I!!I!!
