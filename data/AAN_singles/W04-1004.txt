Paragraph-, word-, and coherence-based approaches to sentence ranking:A comparison of algorithm and human performanceFlorian Wolf, Edward GibsonMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciencesfwolf@mit.edu, egibson@mit.eduAbstractSentence ranking is a crucial part of generating textsummaries.
We compared human sentence rankingsobtained in a psycholinguistic experiment to threedifferent approaches to sentence ranking: A simpleparagraph-based approach intended as a baseline,two word-based approaches, and two coherence-based approaches.
In the paragraph-based ap-proach, sentences in the beginning of paragraphsreceived higher importance ratings than other sen-tences.
The word-based approaches determinedsentence rankings based on relative word frequen-cies (Luhn (1958); Salton & Buckley (1988)).Coherence-based approaches determined sentencerankings based on some property of the coher-ence structure of a text (Marcu (2000); Page etal.
(1998)).
Our results suggest poor perfor-mance for the simple paragraph-based approach,whereas word-based approaches perform remark-ably well.
The best performance was achievedby a coherence-based approach where coherencestructures are represented in a non-tree structure.Most approaches also outperformed the commer-cially available MSWord summarizer.
