Based on the feature of Chinesea phase-based method is proposed to dealwith Chinese temporal information.
To thisend, an algorithm is put forward to classifyverbs into different situation typesautomatically.
About 2981 verbs weretested.
The result has shown that thealgorithm is effective.1.
*IntroductionWe are now launching a researchproject on Events Extraction from ChineseFinancial News, which requires us to extractthe related temporal information from news.Temporal expressions in Chinese form acomplex system.
We cannot fullyunderstand the temporal information only byextracting the verbs, adverbs, auxiliarywords and temporal phrases.
Instead, moreprofound analysis is needed.
In this paper,we first introduce the temporal system ofChinese, then we put forward a method indealing with Chinese temporal information,in which situation types is very important.Therefore, an algorithm is rendered toclassify verbs into several situation types.1.1 Temporal System of ChineseCommonly, Chinese linguists \[3\]\[4\]think that the temporal system of Chineseincludes three parts: phase, tense and aspect.Each of these represents ome profile oftemporal expression (these definitions are alittle different from linguistic theory ofEnglish).
(1) Phase.
A sentence may describe a staticstate or an action; an action may be durativeor instantaneous; a durative action mayindicate a terminal or not.
All of these arethe research fields of phase.
So, static vs.dynamic, durative vs. instantaneous, telic vs.non-telic are three pairs of phase features.Phase depends fully on meaning.
Accordingto phase features, we can classify the verbsinto different situation types.
(2) Tense.
Tense describes the relationsbetween an event (E), reference time (R) andspeaking time (S).
First, taking S as theorigin, we can get three reIations between Rand S: if R is before S, the sentencedescribes past; if R is the same time as S, itdescribes present; if R is after S, it desci'ibesfuture.
This is called primary tense.Secondly, we can get three relationsbetween E and S: If E is before R, we call itanterior; if E is the same time as R, we call itsimple; otherwise we call it posterior.
This iscalled secondary tense.
Therefore, there arenine tenses including anterior past, anteriorfuture, simple future, posterior present, etc.
* Supported by National Natural Science Foundationof China (69975008) and 973 project (G 1998030507)140(3) Aspect .
Aspect reflects the way weobserve an event.
For the same event, thereare many perspectives.
We can take theevent as atomic and not consider its innerstructure, and call it perfective.
We canconsider it being in process, and call itimperfective.
For imperfective, we canobserve it at a"position before it, at thebeginning of it, in the middle of it, etc.Different perspectives lead to differentexpressions in the language.Phase, tense and aspect are notindependent even though they are differentconceptions; each of them can influence andrestrict he others, ultimately building up thecomplex temporal system of Chinese.1.2 Phase-based Chinese temporalinformation analysisMost languages express temporalinformation through phase, tense and aspect,however, for different languages, therelative importance of the three parts isdifferent.
A very important feature ofEnglish is that tense and aspect areexpressed by variation of predicates.
But forChinese, predicates keep the same form nomatter how the tense and aspect aredifferent.Therefore, in English, temporalinformation analysis mainly considers tenseand aspect, as well as temporal adjective andtime words and phrases.
But in Chinese,tense and aspect of a sentence are not veryclear, verbs do not vary in form with thechange of tense and aspect.
So we suggestbasing temporal information analysis onphase.
We mainly perceive the situation typeof a sentence, then roughly acquire tensefrom adverbs and auxiliary words.
Afterconsidering the temporal phrases, we canunderstand the temporal information ofsingle event fully.
Finally, according to theabsolute temporal information of singleevent, we can get the temporal relationbetween two events.
Phase-based temporalinformation analysis has been used in ourresearch on Event Extraction from FinancialNews, in which the most important andfundamental problem is to acquire thesituation types of a sentence.1.3 Situation Classification of ChineseVerbsIn the West, research on situation has along history.
The earliest can be traced tothe times of Aristotle.
In resent years,Western researchers have published a largevolume of papers, which present manypoints of view.
The most important areVendler(1967), Bache(1982), and Smith(1985) They approximately classify thesituation as four types:state, activity, accomplishment, andachievement.Chinese researchers have also doneconsiderable work, among which the mosttypical research were done by Chen\[3\] andMa\[5\].Ma\[5\] stated that the situation of asentence is fully determined by the situationof the main verb of the sentence.
He usethree phases: static, durative, telic to classifyverbs into four situational typesV1,V2,V3,V4.Static Durative TelicVI + + +V2 + +V3 +V4 +Table 1.1Chen\[3\] stated that the situation of asentence not only depends on the main verbof the sentence but also on other parts of thesentence.
That is, although the main verb isthe most important in determining asentence situation, other parts such asadverbs also have effect.
Cheri sclassification is more detailed.141NO.

Our Classification Algorithm forVerbg Situation2.1 Guiding Thoughts(1) Our algorithm is for informationprocessingeMa\[5\] uses three pairs of phase features inclassifying, but from which we can not getan automatic classification algorithm forcomputers; the classification can only bedone manually.eln linguistics, telicity is a phase featureused in classifying.
In table 1.1 thedifference between category V2 and V3, intable 1.3, the difference between "activivJ'and "accomplishmenf', are attributed totelicity.
But in information process, we neednot distinguish whether an event is telic ornot.
For example,Exp.
1~)~t\]~'j~, (He is playing the flute)'~ .
(He is playing a song '%iangzhu " )Chen\[3\] thinks that in Exp.
1, the firstsentence has the features: dynamicity, anddurativity, and non-telicity; it belongsto "activi~' .
The second sentence has thefeatures dynamicity, durativity, and telicity,because in the second sentence, there is adefault terminal .
.
.
.
when the song~angzhd' is over, the action '~la~ isover, so the sentence belongs to'hccomplishmenf instead of  "activity.However we think such discrimination isuseless for information extraction, becausetelicity is an ambiguous concept itself.
Whatwe need is to acquire the exact duration ofthe event.
So if we knew the event isdurative or not, and got the temporalphrases, we can know terminal time of theevent.
Besides, whether an event is telic ornot can not be attributed to collocation andonly can be done manually(as the exp 1shows).
For these reasons, we consider thetwo verbs in Exp.
1 belonging to the samesituational type, that is, we do not usetalicity as a phase feature to classifyingverbs.142(2) Separate classification of the verbsituation from classification of the sentencesituation.Chen\[3\] points that some verbs belongto more than one category, and gives amethod to distinguish these cases.
To makethe ideal more clear, we use two steps tocomplete the seritence situation recognition.In this paper, we render an algorithm toclassify verbs into different categories,which is the basis of another research ... .recognition of sentence situation, which willbe discussed in future work.
'Men(MentalityJ' can follow '~1~ (very).Verbs in the "AmlS' category can followedby "~-~(preposition-objec0' structures, etc.The following is the set of collocationalfeatures.Verb+T~ll~+VerbVerb+~:i-+VerbVerb+~Static verbs Amb Act InsAtt Men+ ?
++(-) + (+)(-) (-) +?Table 2.12.2 Classification MethodWe classify the verbs into five categories ,Att(Attribute), Men(Mentality), Act(Activity) , Ins(Instantaneous) , Amb(Ambiguous).Att: ~(be), ~'(equal), '~'(include), m~(accord with)Men: ~.~J~(like), ~.,(belittle), ~(love), ~ff~(be satisfied with)Act: ~(draw), ~l~l(gab), ~(drink), ~( run)In;  ~?~(explore), ~l;~(extinguish), I~(snap),(discovery)Amb: ~.~(sit), ~i(stand), Jig(lie), ~(kneel), ~:(bring),~(hang), ~(wear), ~-~(install)Amb(Ambiguous) include those wordswhich describe different situations indifferent context.
For example:Exp.
2:(they hung the picture on the wall.
)(Picture is hanging on the wall.
)In Exp.
2, the two sentences have thesame predicate '~  (hang).
In the firstsentence, '~  descnbes an instantaneousaction, but the second sentence describes astate.
In English, forms of these twopredicates are different; while in Chinese,they are the same.
For this reason, weconsider it ambiguous and indistinguishablewithout context.We have pointed out previously thatphase depends only on meaning.
Howeverdifferent situational types collocate withdifferent words.
So the essence of ouralgorithm is replace semantic judgementwith collocational judgement.
For example,2.3 Implementation of the algorithmAccording to table 2.1, a classificationalgorithm was designed, and we use tworesources to implement our algorithm: TheContemporary Chinese Cihai \[11\] (whichwe will refer to as the Cihai below)dictionary and the Machine TractableDictionary of Contemporary ChinesePredicate Verbs \[12\](which we will refer toas the predicate dictionary below).
TheCihai dictionary includes 12,000 entries and700,000 collocation instances, predicatedictionary includes about 3000 verbs withtheir semantic information, case relationsand detailed collocation information.
Thesetwo dictionaries both include some of thecollocation information that the algorithmneeds.Considenng the features of these twodictionaries, we adjust part of our algorithm:(1) In predicate dictionary, there is a slotnamed "verb typ?
, which includes'transitive verlY , 'fntransifive verB' ,~ttribufive verlS", 'linking vertt' etc.
So, atthe beginning of the algorithm, we judge ifthe verb is a "linking verlS' (~(be~', ~(equa l~ '  ,etc) or a "possessiveverlS' ('~-q~J' (have)).
If it is, we directlyclassify the verb as "att(attribute~' withoutfurther processing.
(2) The predicate dictionary provides thecase relation of verbs, and their semanticategodes.
We restrict the agent of verbs inthe "Men(mentality~' tobelong to one of:143"{ .
)kI"(people), "{ )l,.,~} "(human), "1)l,~} "(multitude) , {~s:}(collectivity)'; "{:~:-~?~}(creatures)'; ,,~- ~,-ii,~,~,jtrbel ieff ,  "{gJJl~}(animal)" (3) BecauseCihai includes collocation instances insteadof collocation relations, we should considersynonyms.
To be exact, when we determinewhether a verb belongs to "Men(Mentality~'or not, we judge if it can follow(very) and synonyms such as'trY'P;However, some seldom seen instances wereincluded.
All these cause some errors.The final algorithm is as follows:if (a verb is labeled as" linking verb" or  '~:~ossessive vertfin predicate dictionary )then the verb belongs to "Att(Attribute)"else if (the verb can follow ":~\[~"(very) and synonyms "~.~,I~","1-?~"; '~l"~ '~71~2', "~" )  and (its agenf ssemantic belongs to setl*)then the verb belongs to "Men(Mentality)"else if (it can follow ";t~E") or (be followed by"~")then if (it can be followed by "preposition-object"structure)then the verb belongs to "Amb(Ambiguous)"else the verb belongs to "Act(Activity)"else if (it can be followed by"T")then the verb belongs to"Ins(Instantaneous)"else the verb belongs tff unknown"*setl={human, multitude, collectivity, creatures, belief,animal }3.
Resu l ts  and  Ana lys i s3.1 ResultsWe use the algorithm above to classifythe 2981 words in predicate dictionary, atthe same time, we do the classificationmanually, Table 3.1 is the result:Att Men Amb Ins Act Un- TotelknownHuman 20 112 500 662 1683 4* 2981Algo- 20 111 537 691 1519 i 103 2981Rithm i*this 4 words are not verb.Table 3.1Table 2.2 shows the details:by a lgo -  Classifying b humanrithm Att Men Amb Ins Act Non- TotelverbArt 20 0 0 0 0 0 20Men 0 99 1 1 10 0 111Amb 0 0 473 9 55 0 537Ins 0 0 3 637 51 0 691Act 0 1 12 2 1504 1519Un- 0 12 11 13 63 103knownTotel 20 112 500 662 1683 4 2981Table 3.2Table 3.3 shows precision and recall:Att Men Amb Ins Act AveragePrecision 100.0 89.9 88.1 92.2 99.0 93.8Recall 100.0 88.4 94.6 96.2 89.4 93.7Table 3.33.2 AnalysisWe mainly analyze the errors:(1) Failure of algorithmChinese .is a very complex language.Replacing semantic judgment by usingcollocations has limitation itself.
Forexample, in most cases, whether a verb isdurative or not can be decided by whether itcan be used in such structure "verb-g ~"  (Inmost case, "~ represents an action inprogress).
But some instantaneous verbssuch as ~.
(knocky, can also be used insuch structure to express a repeated action.
(2) Errors caused by the resources(2.1) Collocation incompleteness inCihai: for example, '~(d isagreeJ '  cancollocate with '~  (very), but thiscollocation is not included in Cihai.
(2.2)Errors caused by predicate dictionary:It is obvious that a certain proportion ofdictionary errors is inevitable.
For example,though '~  (beg) can follow '~i~E torepresent the action is in progress, it is notincluded in the corresponding slot ofpredicate dictionary.
(2.3) The inconsistency between the twodictionaries: For example,NN (admire), (mind), and (belittle) are included in predicate dictionarybut not in Cihai.
Although ~ (regret) isincluded in Cihai, it is taken as an adjectiveinstead of a verb.1444.
ConclusionIn this paper, we advance a phase-basedmethod to analyze temporal information inChinese.
For this purpose, an algorithm isrendered to classify verbs into differentsituation types.
Because a verl5 s situationdepends on the meaning of the verb, theessence of our algorithm takes advantage ofcollocations to avoid semantics.
The resultshows the algorithm is successful.
We alsobelieve that if the errors caused by resourceswere eliminated, the result would beimproved significantly.Although the five categories are definedby us, they can describe basic situations ofChinese.
The classification algorithm itselfis independent of resources, so it can beapplied to other resources (dictionaries) ifthese resources include sufficient collocationinformation.
Furthermore, Discardingdictionaries and doing classification directlyon large-scale real corpus, especially incertain domain, deserve the future research.Our algorithm is very useful for thefuture analysis of sentence situation forInformation Extraction system and fordictionary construction.\[5\]Ma Qingzhu.
