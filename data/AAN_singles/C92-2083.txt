IntroductionAs tile research on extracting semantic information from on-line dictionaries proceeds, most progress Iris been made inthe area of extracting the genus terms.
Two methods arebeing used -- pattern matching at the string level and at thestructural nalysis level -- t~th of which seem to yieldequally promising results.Little theoretical work, however, is being doue to determinethe set of possible differentiae tobe identified, and thereforealso the set of possible ,semantic relations that can beextracted from them.
lit fact, Wilks remarks that as far asidentifying the differenliae and organizing that informationinto a list of properties i concerned, "sucb demands arebeyond the abilities of lhe best current extractiontechuiqaes" (Wilks et al 1989, p.227).
However, thecurrent stile of the art in computational linguistics demandsthat semantic information beyond genus terms be availablenow, on a large scale, to push forward the current heories,whetber that is knowledge-based parsing or parsing firstwith a syntactic omponent, followed by a semanticcomponent.In this paper, we will focus on analyzing the definitions notfor the genus terms, but for the semantic relations that canbe extracted from the differentiae (Calzolari 1984).Although many have accepted the use of syntactic analysesfor this purpose for some time now (for example Jeosenand Binot 1987, Klavans 1990, Ravin 1990, andVanderwende 1990, all of which use the PLNLP F~lglishParser to provide the structural information), many othersstill do not.
We will demonstrate with examples why onlypatterns based on syntactic information (henceforth,structural patterns) provide reliable semantic relations forthe differentiae.
Patterns that match definition text at thestring level (henceforth, striug patterns) are conceivable, butcannot capture the variations in the differentiae as easily asstructural patterns.
In addition, although it is possible toparse the definition texts using a grammar designed for onedictionary (e.g.
a grammar of "Longmanese," see Alshawi1989), we have found that a general, broad-coveragegrammar of English or of Italian provides a level of analysisthat is as good as, and possibly superior to, a dictionary-specific grammar I.
In addition, there is up extra effortrequired to apply a broad-coverage text parser to thedefinitions of more than one dictionary, as we found for theLongman Dictionary of Contemporary English (henceforth,LDOCE) and Webster's 7th New Collegiate Dictionary(henceforth, W7) for English, and for II Nuovo DizionarioGarzanti (henceforth, Garzanti) and Italian DMI Database(henceforth, DMI) for Italian.The result of analyzing the differentiae of the definitions ispresented in the form of a semantic frame; there is onesemantic frame for each word sense of the entry.
Thecontents of the frame will be any number of semanticrelatioas (including the genus term) with, as values, theword(s) extracted from the definition text.
Except for acommitment tothe theoretical notion that a word hasdistinguishable s nse,s, the semantic frames are intended tobe tbeory-independent.
Thesemantic frames presented inthis paper correspond to a description of the semanticframes produced by the lexicon-producer (Wilks, pp.
cit., p.217-220) and so can be the input to a knowledge-basedparser.
Also, these semantic frames represent theappropriate l vel of semantic information that is needed bya semantic omponent that has the task of resolving theambiguities remaining after a syntactic component hasassigned an initial analysis (,see Jensen & Binot 1987,Vanderwende 1990).
More generally, the result of thisacquisition process is the construction of a LexicalKnowledge Base to be used as a component for any NLPsystem.2.
Semantic RelationsThe semantic relations that are needed to provide asemantically-motivated analysis of the input text have notyet been enumerated by anyone.
It is possible that this isdue to tile absence of information on a Large scale that canbe used to test any hypothesis of a necessary and sufficientset of semantic relations.
Semantic relations associate aparticular word sense with word(s) extracted automaticallyfrom the dictionary, and those words may be furtherspecified by additional relations.
The values of the semanticIFor example, the grammar for English was used, withoutmodification, to parse over 4000 noun definitions.
With aparser that forces an NP analysis, over 75% of thesedefinitions parsed as full NPs.
These are very good results,especially since many of the remaining 25% do not formcomplete NPs and so were parsed correctly.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 ho~r 1992 5 4 6 PROC.

Inadequacy of String PatternsSome patterns to identify semantic relations are relativelytrivial and can be handled by string patterns.
For example,no matter where the string is found in the definition text,"for (the) purpose(s) of" as well as "con lo/allo scopo di"always indicates a PURPOSE relationship between thedefiniendum and the head of the phrase (noun or verb)following "of/di".
Markowitz et al also discuss patterns atthe string level, based on defining formulae, which extractsuch features as stative or active for adjectives, or member-set relations for nouns.
These are adequate because thepatterns described are generally all found at or close to thebeginning of tile definition text.
But the most interestingpatterns that identify the differentiae and tile (possiblyembedded) semantic relations expressed therein rely on2The parse trees in this paper are altered representationsisomorphic to actual machine output which IBM ASD hasnot allowed us to reproduce.
Heads of constituents aredirectly below their parent node and the nodename is inbold.SPPs are analyzed with a preposition premodifier and anominal as the head.complex stnzctural iuformation, information which cannotbe expressed adequately in string patterns,The following addition makes the pattern for extracting thePURPOSE relation, paratthrased in the previous ection,more complete:if tile PP with "for" is not a post-modifier of a verb "used",then a PURPOSE relation between the definiendum and thehead(s) of the PP c,'m be hypothesized if the nearest nounthat the PP post-modifies i  the genus term.4Consider the syntactic analysis of the relevant portion oftext in the definition of "laboratory" (W7 n,l) shown belowin Figure 5.
Since PP2 and PP4 are coordinated, tilestructural relation to the rest of the analysis will be testedfor tile conjoined constituent, PP1.
The nearest noun phrasethat PP1 post-modifies i  NP1, the head of which, NOUN1,is indeed the genus term (also identified automatically bstructucal patterns applying to this analysis.)
Thus, part oftile semmltic frame for Sense 1 of "laboratory" will be:.

Semantic frame for "lalx)ralory" and the parsefrom which it was derived.Now consider the syntactic analysis of the relevant portionof text in the definition of "council" (LDOCE n): "a groupof people appointed or elected to make laws, rules, ordecisions, for a town, church, etc., or to give advice":4Currently, for English, an abstract relation 1S-FOR ksextracted which will satisfy any searches for a PURPOSErelation.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 5 4 8 PROC.

"for"-PP that does not create a PURPOSErelationship.Tile nearest noun phra~ that PPI post-modifies i  NPI,which is a coordimlted construction.
None of the heads ofNPI, "laws", "rules" or "decisions" can he identified as thegenus term, and so tile patteru does not succeed inextracting a PURPOSE relation from this definition.In order to write a string pattern that would correctlyidentify tile semantic relations above, the pattern wouldhave to identify conjoined heads and apply some measure ofdistance from the genus while counting conjoined phrasesas single units.
In addition, string patterns would also haveto skip parentheses, identify functional arguments, andabstract from the surface realizations of the pattern, e.g.pre- and post-modification (similar observations are madein Ktavans 1990).
Even if the language of dictionarydefinitions is characterized by its regularity, variations ofthe defining formulae xist.
These restrictions seem to befar too complex at tile string level, while writing the patteruat the level of syntactic analysis describes the dependencyin an iutuitive manner, namely in terms of heads andmodifiers.The inadequacy of string patterns i not only evident whenextracting the semantic relations directly related with thedefiniendum, but also when extracting those relations thatshow further specifications.
In particular, the HAS-SUBJECT and HAS-OBJECT relations cannot possibly beextracted reliahly without structural information.
Widersyntactic ontext is also required to correctly extract hesemantic features uch as COLOR, SHAPE, TASTE, andSMELL not only as features of tile definiendum, but also asfurther specifications of the words extracted as the vahms of.semantic relations.The structural pattern that extracts emantic features such asCOLOR and TASTE would seem to be trivial: modifyingadjectives or nouns that express these properties.
Theattachment of these modifiers, however, can be establishedonly ou the basis of syntactic information (and sometimessyntax is not enough).
And only those modifiers hould beextracted that relate to the definiendum or those that relateto some other word within the definition which stands insome semantic relation (for instance HAS-PART, MADE-O1:.
and so forth) with the definienduul.
In tile tatter casetbe informatiml extracted still has an indirect link with theiemma I~eing defined, but it is not expected to be interpretedas a semantic feature of lhe dcfiniendum itself.Consider these examples from tile Garzanti dictionary(followed hy their English glosses):acagiil: "alhcro tropicale dai ti'utti saporiti.
"(mahogany tree: tropical tree with tasty fruits)alchechengi: "pianta erbaceal con bacche di color arancioracchiuse in uu involucre membranaceo, c mmestibile.
"(winter cherry: herbaceous plant with orange berries,contained in a membranaceous coveting, edihle).The TASTE aml tile COl,OR features hould not beextracted as seamntic features of the definicndum.
In thecase of "acagifi," this is clear due to the lack of agreementbetween "albero" (tree) and "sapotiti" (tasty): tile adjectivecannot modify the head noun/genus term Ixx:ause they donot agree in nmnber.
"Saporito", however, is the value ofthe semantic feature TASTE of "frutto" (fruit), which is inturn the value of the HAS-PART relation of thedefiniendum, also extracted by means of a structural patternfront the dcfinition text.

NANr~;s, AUt~.
23-28, 1992If we consider the shaictural description of the definition for"alchechengi," we can see clearly that the embedding ofPP2 within the syntactic structure, followed by anothermodifier of "bacche," AJP1, makes it impossible for PP2,"di color arancio," to modify Ihe head noun "pianta", and sothe semantic fczlture COLOR "anancio" is extracted for"bacche", which is in a PART-OF relation with thedefiniendum.Syntactic information is not always ufficient for resolvingthe correct assigmnenl of semanfic fealures.
Consider theDMI definition for "agnolotto" (a kind of ravioli):agnolottn: "involucro di pasta all'uovo rolondo orettaugolarc.
"(ravinli: ronnd or rectangular covering of egg pastry)The attacimlent of the adjectival phrase "rotondorettangolare" is ambiguous and cmrnot be determined on thehasis of syntactic information, but only I)ased ou semanticinformation; the correct analysis would read a "round orrectangular covering" and not "a round or rectangular egg.
"Despite this syntactic ambiguity, the range in ambiguity forextracting semantic relatimrs and tcatures i  quite reduced ifwe start from syntactic structures instead of from simplestrings.5.
Why a general text parser is sufficientThere are two rea~ns wily a general text parser is essentialfo~ providing the syntactic analyses.
First, of the fourdictionaries that have been explored in this research,Garzanti and DMI (for Italian) and LDOCE and W7 (forEnglisi0, only LDOCE attempts to nse a restrictedvocabulary in the definition texts.
Therefore, Ihe scope ofthe vocabulary is the same as unrestricted text.
Moreover,the language used in dictionaries cannot appropriately becalled a specialized language given that it does not operatein a specialized omain.
Second, at tire syntactic level, thevariety of couslruclions can be compared to thai of textualcorpora.
The regularity of the language used withindictionary definitions, lexically and syntacticallyconstnained, lies in the flequent occurrence of lexieal andsyulactic patterns to express particular conceptualcategories or semantic relations.
This regularity, which iscrucial with respect to the extraction of semanticinformation, can be considered almost irrelevant from tirepoint of view of persing I)ecause of the variety of lexicalchoices and phrasal constnlctions used to express tilepatterns.
A parser, therefore, is faced with the ,,anne rangeof p\['oblems in arralyzing ordinary texts as in dictionarydcfinitions and so the use of a gencral ptapose grammar is alundmnental choice in the definition of our researchframework.One of the main disadvantages ascril)ed to using generaltent parsers is the mobiguity still remaining at the end of thesynt:~cfic analysis.
It has oficn been observed thatde~riptions associated with syntactically ambiguouscoustfuctions ill fi'ee text can bc di~ambiguated in thecontext of dictionary definitions.
For example, within oursystem the default strategy in free text is to attach aprepositional phrase to tile nearest available head and tokeep track of the alternative possible attachment sites.
Inthe context of dictionary definitions, the choice resultingfrom such a default strategy carl often be overridden on thebasis of lexical and/or syntactic onditions whichdisamhiguale tile potential ambiguity; for instance, withregard to the PP attachment case, there is a class of genusterms (such as "atlo," act, "effetto."
effect; "processo,"process) that, together with given structural conditions,make the attachment decision l)ossihle.Also, while functional assignment may be ambiguous inItalian in some cases (Chauod et al 1991).
we can assumethat constructions u ed within dictiomuy definitions andexample senlcnces are always unmarked, and consequentlythat the ambiguity derived from taking into account alsomarked orders of sentence constituents ( uch asSubject-Object-Verb.
Object-Verb-Subject and so forth) isvery unlikely to occur in the dictionary text.Rather than taking these observations a justification forbuilding a dictionary specific parser, we use first a broadcoverage parser, followed by a post-processor which tailorsthe output of the parser based oil the differences observedbetween dictionary text and general text.
As it turns out, thesize of file post-processor is negligible compared to the sizeof the grammar.
This supl)orts our claim that the variety ofsyntactic onstructions in dictionary text is comparable tothat of textmd eorp~)ra.
If dictionary text were substantiallydifferent from general text, we would have had to writemore rtdes in the posl-processor and it would have to bebigger than it in fact is.
Tile structural patterns for theextraction of semantic information aturally operate on theresult of the post-processor (see Montemagni 1992).Twn kinds of refinements have been devised in order toachieve more appropriate r sults with respect to theI~mguage used within diclionaries:(1) rule out ambiguity in the attachment of modifiers or inthe assignment of functional roles which is not applicable inthe context of dictionary definitions;(2) handle parses that are incomplete due to eitherdictionary specific constructions ot occurring in free texts,or, more generally, to gaps in tile lexical or grammaticalknowledge of the system.While the first refinement operates on a complete analysisbut aims to reduce the high degree of ambiguity typical offree text by exploiting pcculiarities of dictionary language.the second refinement concerns thc robustness of the systemin the abscnce of a complete parse.For an example of refining the parse in order to reduce theambiguity, consider the Garzanti definition (n,l) of"comput:~ione" (computation) defined ,as "alto, effelto delcomputare" (the act or result of computing).

Thelexical and synlactic ouditions which make timdisamhigualion possible ;tre defined in the l~)sVprocessor tothe general text analysis.Tbe solution to a robust phrasal analysis while parsingdictionary text with a general grammar cau he secn andfaced from two different perspectives.
The first perspectiveis dictionary specific and de,'ds with incomplete pauses dueto input which would be considered ungrammatical outsidcof the context of dictionary definitions.
The secondperspective copes with incomplete knowledge of languageuse by exploiting the general technique of fitted parsingprovided by the system fi)r handling ill-formed inpnt(Jensen et al 19831.Dictionary definitions are quite often fl)rnmlated ascondensed fragments of real texts, with elidcd elementswhich make the definition syntactically ill-formed andinterpretable only by reference to a wider context.
This istim case with noun definitions consisting of a noun phrasepre-modified by a prepositional phrxse, where the latterspecifies the usage domain of the word sense expressed bythe former.
The general grammar is unable to produce anNP node covering the whole input string given that thesequence PP-NP does not freely occur within ordinary texts.It is the refinement stage that should reshape the analysisand restore it ,as regular input on the basis of Slrecializeddiclionat y use.

Thegeneral Italian grammar provided complete parses for about65-70% oflhese definitions.
An improvement comprising10-15% of the total was achieved uring the refinementstage.
For the unresolved incomplete parses, approximately15-20%, a different extraction procedure, based on acombination of partial structural patterns and string patternsas described above, has been hypolhesized.
Even if thisprocedure is at an early development stage, it is possible toevaluate the first results.
Because of the robust strategy, theextraction procedure can be applied to lhe entire corpus ofdefinitions, without he worry Ihat incomplete parses wouldaffect he extraction of semantic information.
Someinformation isextracted in any ease; in the worst case theinformation is not very deep or detailed (at least he genusterm is extracted).
The results can be differentiated bydegree of detail, but the extraction procedure never fails toproduce some results.6.
ConclusionViewed ideally, the choice between structural patterns andstring patterns i  obviously in favor of structural patterns,because they are more suitable for achieving accuracy in theextraction of semantic information from dictionaries.Controversy rises only when considering the reliability ofparsing the dictionary definitions themselves.
In this paper,we show the feasibility of applying structural patterns toparsed efinitions in order to extract semantic informationfrom dictionaries, with the goal of deriving and makingexplicit he basic general knowledge implicitly stored in anystandard printed ictionary.
Structural patterns, much morethan string patterns, provide the rich semantic informationthat makes the lexicon a relational network expanding in n-dimensions.
Not only semantic features or relations directlyrelated to the definiendum are extracted, but also furtherspecifications of the words extracted as values of semanticfeatures or relations.We have also described a robust procedure for extractingthis semantic information.
The syntactic analysis of thedefinition text provided by a general text parser is evaluatedautomatically and, if necessary, a post-process applies 1orefine the parse given the context of a dictionary, Theresults of the structural patterns are differentiated accordingto the success of the parse.
In this way, the use of agrammar improves the quality and the reliability of thesemantic information extracted.ReferencesAlshawi, H. 1989.
