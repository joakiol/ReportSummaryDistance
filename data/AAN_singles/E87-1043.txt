In general onecan d is t inguish two kinde of those adverbials :t~e re la t iona l  ones, which express a re la t ionOetween the reference time and the speech time,such as "~esterday" a'nd "tomorrow", and the non-re la t iona l  ones, which ident i fy  the locat ion o~ an:nterva l  without any reference to the speech t~me,suc~ as "between 8 and 9" and "at two o c lock".The in terest ing  thing now is t~at only thela t te r  adverbials can occur in the scope of afrequency adverbia l .

These remarks might~e made by a system operator, watcnlng ~is screen'(lb.
).Hess concludes from these observations that thequant i f ier  of the subject is universal in (24) ande~:isten~ial in (25-27), However~ th is  conclusiondoes not foliow automatically.
In terms of theformalism presented in this  paper one could sa~that (24) has an habitual in terpretat ion ,  whereasthe other sentences have a non- i terat iveinterpretat ion,  In the former case the ex is tent ia lquant i f ier  of the subject wi l l  be in the scope o~the Most-quantif ier,  whereas in the la t te r  case i twl i i  not be in the scope of any non-existentialquant i f ie r ,  and this accounts for the differencein interpretat ion without havinq to postulate twopossiole meanings for the indef in i te  a r t i c le .Hess s examples are useful in this  context,t~ough, because they clear ly i l l us t ra te  the roieof the vend for~ in the interpretat ion.
Since i tis the only variable part in the sentences, the~ifferences in interpretat ion can only be ascribeoto them, more spec i f i ca l ly  to their hab l tua i i tyvalue.
;or the assignment of an hab l tua l i ty  value to agiven verb form one has to test whether i t  can orcannot e l i c i t  an habitual interpretat ion in somegiven context.
In testing this  one shouldi.
always use sentences with a non-stative basicproposit ion, for i~ the la t te r  is stat ive thesentence can never be habitual (of.
supra) ;2. pay attention to the other inter i lngual  valuesof the verb form.
The English simple present.for instance, is uneouivocally \[+habitual\]  ini t s  sim~Itaneoue meaning, but in i t s  posteriormeaning i t  can be \ [ -nao i tua l \ ]  too (of.
thenon- i terat ive interpretat ion of "he leaves attwelve"~.The relevance of the \ [+/ -Hab i tua l i tv \ ] -d is t inct ion  has so far only been demonstrated froma monolln~ual semantic point of view.
I t  is ,however, possible to give some translat ionalevidence for this o let inct lo= as well.The relevant cas~s are tne ones where thecorresponding verb forms have  Oi~ferenthab i :~a l l ty  values.
A good example of th is  is thetranslat ion of the Dutch simple present inEn~ilsh.The Dutch simple present can be both habitua}and ~on-hacitual in It~ simultaneous meaning :28; hi~ o,'inxt aileen whisky <simui,y,~haOitual~"he drinks only whisky'29, Liji~, h i j  dr!nit k~4 ie  .
