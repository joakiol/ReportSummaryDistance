It is there-fore crucial to advance current surveil-lance mechanisms for these virusesthrough outlets such as phylogeography.Phylogeographic techniques may be ap-plied to trace the origins and geographicaldistribution of these viruses using se-quence and location data, which are oftenobtained from publicly available data-bases such as GenBank.
Despite the abun-dance of zoonotic viral sequence data inGenBank records, phylogeographic anal-ysis of these viruses is greatly limited bythe lack of adequate geographic metadata.Although more detailed information mayoften be found in the related articles refer-enced in these records, manual extractionof this information presents a severe bot-tleneck.
In this work, we propose an auto-mated system for extracting this infor-mation using Natural Language Pro-cessing (NLP) methods.
In order to vali-date the need for such a system, we firstdetermine the percentage of GenBank rec-ords with ?insufficient?
geographicmetadata for seven well-studied zoonoticviruses.
We then evaluate four differentnamed entity recognition (NER) systemswhich may help in the automatic extrac-tion of information from related articlesthat can be used to improve the GenBankgeographic metadata.
This includes anovel dictionary-based location taggingsystem that we introduce in this paper.11 IntroductionZoonotic viruses, viruses that are transmittablebetween animals and humans, have become in-creasingly prevalent in the last century leading tothe rise and re-emergence of a variety of diseases(Krauss, 2003).
In order to enhance currentlyavailable surveillance systems for these viruses, abetter understanding of their origins and transmis-sion patterns is required.
This need has led to agreater amount of research in the field of phylo-geography, the study of geographical lineages ofspecies (Avise, 2000).
Population health agenciesfrequently apply phylogeographic techniques totrace the evolutionary changes within viral line-ages that affect their diffusion and transmissionamong animal and human hosts (Ciccozzi et al.,2013; Gray and Salemi, 2012; Weidmann et al.,2013).
Prediction of virus migration routes en-hances the chances of isolating the viral strain forvaccine production.
In addition, if the source ofthe strain is identified, intervention methods maybe applied to block the virus at the source andlimit outbreaks in other areas.Phylogeographic analysis depends on the utili-zation of both the sequence data and the locationof collection of specific viral sequences.
Re-searchers often use publicly available databasessuch as GenBank for retrieving this information.For instance, Wallace and Fitch (2008) used datafrom GenBank records to study the migration ofthe H5N1 virus in various animal hosts over Eu-rope, Asia and Africa, and were able to identifythe Guangdong province in China as the source ofthe outbreak.
However, the extent of phylogeo-graphic modeling is highly dependent on the spec-ificity of available geospatial information and thelack of geographic data more specific than thestate or province level may limit phylogeographicanalysis and distort results.
In the previous exam-ple, Wallace and Fitch (2008) had to use town-level information to identify the source of theH5N1 outbreak; without specific location data,they would not have been able to identify theGuangdong province as the source.
Unfortu-nately, while there is an abundance of sequencedata in GenBank records, many of them lack suf-ficient geographic metadata that would enablespecific identification of the isolate?s location ofcollection.
A prior study conducted by Scotch etal.
(2011) showed that the geographic informationof 80% of the GenBank records associated withsingle or double stranded RNA viruses within tet-rapod hosts is less specific than 1st level adminis-trative boundaries (ADM1) such as state or prov-ince.Though many of the records lack specific geo-graphic metadata, more detailed information is of-ten available within the journal articles referencedin them.
However, manual extraction of this infor-mation is time-consuming and cumbersome andpresents a severe bottleneck on phylogeographicanalysis.
In this work, we investigate the potentialof NLP techniques to enhance the geographic dataavailable for phylogeographic studies of zoonoticviruses using NER systems.
In addition to geo-graphic metadata and sequence information, Gen-Bank records also contain several other forms ofmetadata such as host, collection date and gene foreach isolate.
Journal articles that are referenced inthese records often mention the location of isola-tion for the viral sample in conjunction with re-lated metadata (Figure 1 provides an example ofsuch a case).
Therefore, by allowing identificationof location mentions along with mentions of re-lated GenBank metadata in these articles, we be-lieve that NER systems may help to accuratelylink each GenBank record to its corresponding lo-cation of isolation and distinguish it from other lo-cation mentions.Previously Scotch et al.
(2011) evaluated theperformance of BANNER (Leaman and Gonza-lez, 2008) and the Stanford NER tool (Finkel etal., 2005) for automated identification of gene andlocation mentions respectively, in 10 full-textPubMed articles, each related to a specific Gen-Bank record.
They were both found to achieve f-scores of less than 0.45, thereby establishing theneed for NER systems with better performanceand/or a larger test corpus (Scotch et al, 2011).
Inthis study, we start by evaluating the state of geo-graphic insufficiency for zoonotic viruses in Gen-Bank records using a new automated approach.Next, we further expand upon the work done byScotch et al.
(2011) by building our own diction-ary-based location-tagging system and evaluatingits performance on a larger corpus correspondingto over 8,500 GenBank records for zoonotic vi-ruses.
In addition, we also evaluate the perfor-mance of three other state-of-the-art NER toolsfor tagging gene, date and species mentions in thiscorpus.
We believe that identification of these en-tities will be useful for the future development ofa system for extracting the location of collectionof viral isolates from articles related to their re-spective GenBank records.2GenBank RecordFigure 1.
Example of how the date, gene, and strain metadata within a GenBank record may beused to differentiate between two potential locations in a related article2 MethodsThe process undertaken to complete this study canbe divided into three distinct stages: selection ofthe zoonotic viruses and extraction of relevantGenBank data related to each virus, computationof ?sufficiency?
statistics on the extracted data,and development/evaluation of NER systems fortagging location, gene, date and species mentionsin full-text PubMed Central articles.
A detaileddescription of each phase is given below.2.1 Virus Selection and GenBank Data Ex-tractionThe domain of this study has been limited to zo-onotic viruses that are most consistently docu-mented and tracked by public health, agricultureand wildlife state departments within the UnitedStates.
These viruses include influenza, rabies,hantavirus, western equine encephalitis (WEE),eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louis en-cephalitis (SLE), and West Nile virus (WNV).The Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities)was used to download the following fields from59,595 GenBank records associated with these vi-ruses: GenBank Accession ID, PubMed CentralID, Strain name, Collection date and Country.These records were the result of a query per-formed to retrieve all accession numbers relatedto the selected viruses which had at least one ref-erence to a PubMed Central article.

In or-der to perform this computation, we used datafrom the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 1  table and theGeoNames database.
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 isthe International Standard for representing coun-try names using two-letter codes.
The GeoNames2database contains a variety of geospatial data forover 10 million locations on earth, including theISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the country of eachlocation and a feature code that can be used to de-termine the administrative level of each location.To allow for efficient querying, we downloadedthe main GeoNames table and the ISO alpha-2country codes table from their respective websitesand stored them in a local SQL database.
Prior toadding the ISO data to the database, some com-monly used country names and their correspond-ing country codes were added to the table since itonly included a single title for each country.
Forexample, the ISO table included the country name?United States?
but not alternate names such as?USA?, ?United States of America?, or ?US?.
Us-ing the created database in conjunction with a par-ser written in Java, we were able to retrieve most2 Geonames.org.

Sufficiency CriteriaSufficiency Criteria: For the purpose of thisproject, we considered any geographical bound-ary more specific than ADM1 to be ?sufficient?.Based on this criterion, a feature code inGeoNames was categorized as sufficient only if itwas absent from the following list of featurecodes: ADM1, ADM1H, ADMD, ADMDH, PCL,PCLD, PCLF, PCLH, PCLI and PCLS.
Evalua-tion of the geographical sufficiency of a GenBankrecord was dependent upon whether the record in-cluded a country name.
A GenBank record with acountry mention was called sufficient if the geo-graphic information extracted from that record in-cluded another place mention whose feature codefell within the class of sufficient feature codes andwhose ISO country code matched that of the re-trieved country.
For instance, a GenBank recordwith the geographic metadata ?Orange County,United States?
will be called sufficient since theplace ?Orange County?
has a sufficient featurecode of ?ADM2?
and a country code of ?US?which matches the country code of the retrievedcountry, ?United States?.
Place mentions withmatching country codes often had several differ-ent feature codes in GeoNames.
Such places wereonly called sufficient if all feature codes corre-sponding to the given pair of place name andcountry code were classified as sufficient.
In caseswhere the GenBank record had no country men-tion, the record was called sufficient only if allmatching GeoNames entries for any of the placesmentioned in it had sufficient feature codes.
Thesufficiency criteria were designed to ensure that ageographic location is only called sufficient if itsadministrative level was found to be more specificthan ADM1 without any form of ambiguity.
Fig-ure 3 illustrates the pathways of geographical suf-ficiency for GenBank records in a diagram.Sufficiency Computation: In order to obtainthe geographic information for each Genbank rec-ord, we used a Java parser which automaticallyextracted data from the ?country?
field of eachrecord.
Since the ?country?
field typically con-tained multiple place mentions divided by a set ofdelimiters consisting of comma, colon and hy-phen, we first split this field using these delimit-ers.
We then checked each string obtainedthrough this process against the ISO country codetable to determine whether it was a potential coun-try name for the record?s location.
If the queryreturned no results, then the locally storedGeoNames table was searched and for each matchfound, the corresponding ISO country code andfeature code were extracted.
Figure 4 shows a di-agram of this process.Figure 3.
Sufficiency Calculation ExampleIn cases where no sufficient location data wasfound from the ?country?
field of a GenBank rec-ord, the Java parser searched through its ?strain?field.
This was done because some viral strainssuch as influenza include their location of originintegrated into their names.
For example, the in-fluenza strain ?A/duck/Alberta/35/76?
indicatesthat the geographic origin of the strain is Alberta.The different sections of a strain field are sepa-rated by either forward slash, parenthesis, comma,colon, hyphen or underscore and so we used a setof delimiters consisting of these characters to splitthis field.
Each string thus retrieved was queriedas before on the ISO country code table and theGeoNames table.
GeoNames often returnedmatches for strings like ?raccoons?
and ?chicken?which were actually meant to be names of hostspecies within the ?strain?
field, and so a list of4Figure 4.
Example of annotation including all four entitiessome of the most frequently seen host name men-tions in these records was manually created andfiltered out before querying GeoNames.Some of the place mentions contained very spe-cific location information which resulted inGeoNames not finding a match for them.
A listwas created for strings like ?north?, ?south-east?,?governorate?
etc.
which when removed from aplace mention may produce a match.
In cases ofpotential place mentions which contained any oneof these strings and for which GeoNames returnedno matching result, a second query was performedafter removal of the string.Evaluation of Sufficiency Computation: Wemanually annotated 10% of all influenza recordsin GenBank which reference at least one PubMedCentral article as sufficient or insufficient basedon our sufficiency criteria (5731 records).
Wethen ran our program on these records and com-pared system results with annotated results.2.3 Development/Evaluation of NER sys-temsCreation of Gold Standard Corpus: We createda gold standard corpus consisting of twenty-sevenmanually-annotated full-text PubMed Central ar-ticles in order to evaluate the performance of NERsystems for tagging location, gene, species anddate mentions in text.
The articles corresponded toover 8,500 GenBank records and were randomlysampled using the subset of extracted GenBankrecords which contained a link to PubMed Centralarticles and had insufficient geographic metadata.Three annotators tagged the following four en-tities in each article using the freely available an-notation tool, BRAT (Stenetorp et al., 2012): genenames, locations, dates and species.
Figure 4 pro-vides an example of the manual annotation inBRAT.
We annotated all mentions of each entitytype, not only those relevant to zoonotic viruses,in order to evaluate system performance.
A totalof over 19,000 entities were annotated within thiscorpus.
The number of tokens annotated wasabout 24,000.
A set of annotation guidelines wascreated for this process (available upon request).Before creating the guidelines, each annotator in-dividually annotated six common articles andcompared and discussed their results to devise areasonable set of rules for annotating each entity.After discussion, the annotators re-annotated thecommon articles based on the guidelines and di-vided the remaining articles amongst themselves.The inter-annotator agreement was calculated foreach pair of annotators.
The annotated corpus willbe made available at diego.asu.edu/downloads.Development of Automated Location Tag-ger: We developed a dictionary-based NER sys-tem using the GeoNames database for automatedidentification of location mentions in text.
Thedictionary used by this system, which we willhereby refer to as GeoNamer, was created by re-trieving distinct place names from the GeoNamestable and filtering out commonly used words fromthe retrieved set.
Words filtered out include stopwords such as ?are?
and ?the?, generic place namessuch as ?cave?
and ?hill?, numbers like ?one?
and?two?, domain specific words such as ?biology?and ?DNA?, most commonly used surnames like?Garcia?, commonly used animal names such as?chicken?
and ?fox?
and other miscellaneouswords such as ?central?.
This was a crucial stepsince the GeoNames database contains a wide ar-ray of commonly used English words which maycause a large volume of false positives if not re-moved.
The final dictionary consists of 5,396,503entries.
In order to recognize place mentions in a5given set of text files, GeoNamer first builds a Lu-cene index on the contents of the files.
It then con-structs a phrase query for every entry in theGeonames dictionary and runs each query on theLucene index.
The document id, query text, startoffset and end offset for every match found iswritten to an output file.
We chose this approachbecause of its simplicity and efficiency.Evaluation of NER Systems: Four differentNER systems for identifying species, gene, dateand location mentions in text were evaluated us-ing the created gold standard.
The evaluated sys-tems include LINNEAUS (Gerner et al., 2010),BANNER, Stanford SUTime (Chang and Man-ning, 2012) and GeoNamer.
LINNEAUS, BAN-NER and Stanford SUTime are widely-used,state-of-the-art open source NER systems forrecognition of species, gene and temporal expres-sions respectively.
GeoNamer is the system wedeveloped in this work for the purpose of tagginglocations, as described earlier.3 Results3.1 Sufficiency AnalysisThe system for classifying records as sufficient orinsufficient was found to have an accuracy of 72%as compared to manual annotation.

Performance Statistics of NER64 DiscussionBased on our analysis, at least half of the Gen-Bank records for each of the studied zoonotic vi-ruses lack sufficient geographic information, andthe proportion of insufficient records can be ashigh as 90%.
Our automated system for classify-ing records as insufficient or sufficient was foundto have an accuracy of 72% with 98% of the errorsbeing a result of insufficient records being calledsufficient.
Therefore, our computed estimate ofinsufficiency is very likely to be an underestima-tion of the actual problem.
The virus with thehighest level of sufficiency, EEE, had a largenumber of records with county level informationin the ?country?
field.
However, the insufficientrecords for this virus typically contained no placemention, not even at the country level.
A key rea-son for our calculated percentage of sufficientGenBank records being higher for these seven vi-ruses than what has been previously computed byScotch et al.
(2011) was the inclusion of the?strain?
field.
The ?strain?
field often containedspecific location information which, when com-bined with place mentions present within the?country?
field, made the record geographicallysufficient.
The virus for which the inclusion of?strain?
field had the greatest impact on boostingthe sufficiency percentage was influenza.
Most ofthe GenBank records associated with this virushad structured ?strain?
fields from which the par-ser could easily separate place mentions usingGeoNames.Although the sufficiency classifications pro-duced by our system were correct most of thetime, there were a few cases where a record gotincorrectly labeled as insufficient even when itcontained detailed geographic information.
Thistypically happened because GeoNames failed toreturn matching results for these places.
For in-stance, the country field ?India: Majiara,WB?
wasnot found to be sufficient even though Majiara isa city in India because GeoNames has no entry forit.
In some cases the lack of matching result wasdue to spelling variations of the place name.
Forinstance the country field ?Indonesia: Yogjakarta?was called insufficient since ?Yogjakarta?
isspelled as ?Yogyakarta?
in GeoNames.
Some-times the database simply did not contain the ex-act string present in the GenBank record.
For in-stance, it does not have any entry for the place?south Kalimantan?
but it contains the place name?kalimantan?.
The number of sufficient recordswhich were called insufficient by our system dueto inexact matching were greatly mitigated by re-moving strings such as ?south?
from the placemention, as described in the ?Methods?
section.Most of the NER systems performed signifi-cantly better with overlap measures than with ex-act-match measures.
This is because our annota-tion guidelines typically involved tagging thelongest possible match for each entity and the au-tomated systems frequently missed portions ofeach annotation.
Stanford SUTime had the bestoverlap f-measure of 0.785, closely followed byLINNEAUS with an overlap f-measure of 0.781.Although Stanford SUTime was fairly effective atfinding date mentions in text, it tagged all four-digit-numbers such as ?1012?
and ?2339?
asyears, leading to a number of false positives.
Thepoor recall of LINNEAUS was mostly caused be-cause the dictionary used by LINNEAUS taggedonly species mentions in text while we tagged ge-nus and family mentions as well.
It also missed alot of commonly used animal names such as mon-key, bat, badger and wolf.
GeoNamer was thethird best performer with the highest recall butsecond lowest precision.
This is because theGeoNames dictionary contains an extensivelylarge list of location names, many of which arecommonly used words such as ?central?.
Eventhough we filtered out a vast majority of thesewords, it still produced false positives such as?wizard?.
However, its performance was consid-erably better than that of the Stanford location tag-ger used by Scotch et al.
(2011) which was foundto have a recall, precision and f-score of 0.26, 0.81and 0.39 respectively.
The improved performancewas achieved because of the higher recall of oursystem.
The GeoNames dictionary provides anextensive coverage of all location mentions in theworld and the Stanford NER system, which is aCRF classifier trained on a different dataset, wasnot able to recognize many of the place mentionspresent in full-text PMC articles related to Gen-Bank records.BANNER showed the poorest performanceamongst all the entity taggers evaluated in this pa-per.
In fact, the f-score we achieved for BANNERin this study was much lower that its past f-scoreof 0.42 within the domain of articles related toGenBank records for viral isolates (Scotch et al.,2011).
As mentioned by Scotch et al.
(2011), akey reason for BANNER?s poor performance inthis domain is the difference between the data setused to train the BANNER model and the annota-tion corpus used to test this system.
The versionof BANNER used in these two studies was trainedon the training set for the BioCreative 2 Gene7Mention task, which comprised of 15,000 sen-tences from PubMed abstracts.
These abstracts of-ten contained the full names for gene and proteinmentions while the full-text articles we usedmostly contained the abbreviated forms of genenames, which BANNER tended to miss.
The arti-cles also contained abbreviated forms of severalentities such as viral strain name (e.g.
H1N1) andspecies name (e.g.
VEEV) which look similar toabbreviated gene names.
Therefore, BANNER of-ten misclassified these entities as gene mentions.A possible reason for BANNER having a muchlower performance in this study than in the previ-ous study conducted by Scotch et al (2011) is thepresence of a large number of tables in the journalarticles we selected.
BANNER is a machine learn-ing system based on conditional random fieldswhich uses orthographic, morphological and shal-low syntax features extracted from sentences toidentify gene mentions in text.
Such features donot help greatly for extraction from tables.
There-fore, BANNER was often not able to identify thegene mentions in the tables present within our cor-pus, thereby producing false negatives.
Moreover,it tagged several entries within the table as a singlegene name, thereby producing false positives aswell.
This reduced both the recall and precision ofBANNER.Although this study explores the problem of in-sufficient geographic information in GenBankmore thoroughly than past studies, the number ofpapers annotated as the gold standard is still lim-ited.
Thus, the performance of the taggers re-ported can be construed as a preliminary estimateat best.
The set of taggers and their performanceseem to be adequate for a large-scale application,with the exception of BANNER.
However, we didnot make any changes to the BANNER system(specifically, re-training) since changes to it arenot possible until sufficient data is annotated forretraining.5 Conclusions and Future WorkIt can be concluded that the majority of Gen-Bank records for zoonotic viruses do not containsufficient geographic information concerningtheir origin.
In order to enable phylogeographicanalysis of these viruses and thereby monitor theirspread, it is essential to develop an efficient mech-anism for extracting this information from pub-lished articles.
Automated NER systems may helpaccelerate this process significantly.
Our resultsindicate that the NER systems LINNEAUS, Stan-ford SUTime and GeoNamer produce satisfactoryperformance in this domain and thus can be usedin the future for linking GenBank records withtheir corresponding geographic information.However, the current version of BANNER is notwell-suited for this task.
We will need to trainBANNER specifically for this purpose before in-corporating it within our system.We are currently altering the component of ourprogram which classifies records as sufficient orinsufficient in order to reduce the number of errorsdue to insufficient records being called sufficient.We are also manually looking through GenBankrecords for zoonotic viruses with insufficient geo-graphic metadata and linking them to the locationmentions in related articles which we deem to bethe most likely location of collection for the givenviral isolate.
The resulting annotated corpus willbe used to train and evaluate an automated systemfor populating GenBank geographic metadata.We have already covered all GenBank records re-lated to Encephalitis viruses and close to 10% ofall records related to Influenza which are linked toPubMed Central articles.
The annotation processhas revealed that a large proportion of the infor-mation allowing linkage of GenBank records togeographic metadata is often present in tableswithin the articles in addition to textual sentences.Therefore, we have developed a Python parser forautomatically linking GenBank records to loca-tion mentions using tables from the HTML ver-sion of the PubMed Central articles.
Future workwill include further expansion of this annotationcorpus and the development of an integrated sys-tem for enhancing GenBank geographic metadatafor phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses.AcknowledgementResearch reported in this publication was sup-ported by the NIAID of the NIH under AwardNumber R56AI102559 to MS and GG.
