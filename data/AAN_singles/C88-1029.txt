Morphology and cross dependencies In the synthesis of personal pronounsin Romance languagesLaurence DANLOS and Fiagametta NAMERLADL, Universit6 de Paris 72, Place Jussieu75251 Paris Cedex 05, FranceAbstractThis paper describes ome of the problems that arise fromthe synthesis of personal pronouns in a system tlratgenerates texts in Romance languages.
It puts theemphasis first on the fact that fire morphological level hasto betaken hire account early in the generation process,second on the numerous "cross dependency" phenomenawhich are to b,; found when the synthesis of an element Xdepends upon that of another element Y and when thesynthesis of "Y depends upon that of X.
The linguisticexamples are taken from French and Italian languages, forwlfich a robust generatiort system has been implemented.1 IntroductionIt is generally believed that a generation system can bemodularized into a sequence of components, the first onemaking the "high level" decisions (i.e.
the conceptualdecisions), the following ones making the linguisticdecisions (e.g.
lexical and syntactic onstruction choices),the penultimate, one performing the "low level" operations(i.e.
the syntactic operations), and the last one handlingthe morphological operations.
We have shown in (L.DanIos1985, 1987a) that the conceptual and linguisticdecisions are operations that depend on each other.Therefore, we designed a generation system modularized inthe following way: a "strategic omponent" makes theconceptual and linguistic decisions simultaneously andgives back "clause templates" which are synthesized intoclauses by a "syntactic omponent".
A simplified versionof the clause template syntax is the following one (a morecomplete version is presented in (L. Danlos 1987b)) :\[Cll = ( :e l  \[subject\] \[verb\] cplt n (0<_n~2))\[subject\] :: (:subject oken)\[verb\] = (:verb verb )cplt = \[dir-object\] / I/t-object\] / \[de-object\] / [prgp-object\]\[dir-object\] = (:dir-object token)\[h-object\] = (:h-object oken)\[de-object\] = (:de-object token)\[pr6p-object\] = (:pr6p-object \[pr6p\] (:object oken))\[prgp\] = (:pr6p preposition )The prepositional complements JR-object\] and \[de-object\]are complements respectively introduced by ~,  and de inFrench, a and di in Italian.
They are separated from theprepositional complements \[prgp-object\] introduced byother prepositions because they have a specific syntacticbehaviour, especially in regard to pronominalization (cf.3).
An example of a clause template is :CC1 (:subject HUM1) (:verb amare ) (:dir-objectHUM2))withHUM1 =: PERSON HUM2 =: PERSONNAME : Idgo NAME : MariaSEX : mast SEX : fernAccording to the context (i.e.
fire clause templates thathave been previously synthesized), the syntacticcomponent, which handles pronominalization, producesone of the following Italian clauses (given that the verbis in the present ense) :Ugo ama Maria (Ugo loves Mary)Ugo l'ama (Ugo loves her)Quest'uomo l'ama (This man loves her)Ama questa donna (He loves this woman)It will be shown in 3 that pronominalization involves themorphological  level.
Tire decisions concerningpronominalization, which is a stumbling block for naturallanguage processing, must certainly not be made last.Thus, the morphological level (level supposedly very"low") must not be taken into account only at the verylast stage of the generation process.The second aim of this paper is to put forward "non localdependencies" which are to be found when the synthesis ofan element X depends upon that of another element Y.Such a dependency requires the synthesis of X to becarried out after that of Y, whatever the order of X and Y inthe clause template.
Moreover, cases of "crossdependencies" are to be found when the synthesis of Xdepends upon that of Y and when the synthesis of Ydepends upon that of X.
A cross dependency leads toconflicting orderings, namely synthesis of X after that ofY and synthesis of Y after that of X.
The solution to suchconflicting orderings is to perform a sequence ofincomplete syntheses of X and Y.2 Non local and cross dependenciesThe syalthesis of the verb and direct object in French willbe taken as an illustration of non local and crossdependencies.
On file one lland, the synthesis of the verbdepends upon that of the \[dir-object\] for two reasons.First, there is a switch from the auxiliary avoir to theauxiliary dtre (when the verb is conjugated in a compoundtense) if the \[dir-object\] is synthesized as a reflexivepronoun (which must appear before the verb) :Ugo a ddtestd Marie (Ugo hated Mary)Ugo s'est d~testd (Ugo hated himself)Second, there is agreement in gender and number betweenthe past participle of a verb conjugated in a compoundtense and a \[dir..object\] synthesized as a personal pronoun(which must appear before the verb) :Ugo, je l'ai ddtest~ (IJgo, I hated him)Marie, je l'ai ddtestJe (Mary, I hated her)On tire other hand, the synthesis of the \[dir-object\]depends upon that of the verb in the following way whichwill be explained in detail in 3 : determining whether the\[dir-object\] has to be synthesized as a personal pronounmay depend upon the first letter and the form of theconjugated verb.
All in all, the synthesis of the verbdepends upon that of the \[dir-objeet\] and the synthesis ofthe \[dir-objeet\] depends upon that of the verb.
This crossdependency can be handled with the following sequence ofincomplete syntheses :1) Determine if the \[dir-object\] must be synthesized as areflexive pronoun (by checking if its value is equal to thevalue of the subject).
If it is, mark the verb as having tobe conjugamd with the auxiliary ~tre.2) Synthesize the verb (i.e.
conjugate it) without taking139into account a possible agreement between a pastparticiple and a pronominalized \[dir-object\].
In Step 2, theverb is conjugated in a compound tense with the rightauxiliary thanks to Step 1.
Let us mention that theconjugation of a verb is a morphological operation.3) Synthesize the \[dir-object\] if it has not beensynthesized as a reflexive pronoun in Step 1.
In Step 3,the form of the conjugated verb provided by Step 2 is usedto determine if the \[dir-object\] has to be synthesized as apersonal pronoun.4) Complete the synthesis of the verb if necessary, i.e.carry out the agreement in gender and number between apast participle if any (information given by Step 2) and apronominalized \[dir-object\] if any (infomation given byStep 3).These four steps imply that both the direct object and theverb are checked over twice.
Note that this is only for thesynthesis of these two elements.
The cross dependenciesthat arise from other elements imply that the direct objectand the verb are checked over more thant twice.
Generallyspeaking, a clause template (i.e.
a tree) is gone throughseveral times in the syntactic omponent.3 Synthesis of personal  pronounsIf a token refers to the speaker(s) or the hearer(s), it mustbe synthesized as a first or second person pronoun; theonly operation to be performed is the computation of this"dialogue" pronoun.
Otherwise, we consider synthesizing atoken as a flfird person pronoun only if it has already beensynthesized (because occuring in a previous clausetemplate, for example).
In other words, w e do not considerthe left pronominalization phenomena (T. Reinhart 1983).Determining whether a token which does not refer to thespeaker(s) or hearer(s) and which has already beensynthesized has to be synthesized as a personal pronounrequires the following steps to be gone through:1) Compute the form of the foreseen pronoun (eL 3.1);2) Compute the list L1 of tokens that have beensynthesized in nominal phrases whose "morphological"features (i.e.
gender and number) are compatible with theform of the foreseen pronoun (eL 3.2).3) Compute the sublist L2 of L1 that contains only theelements of L2 that are syntactically compatible with theforeseen pronoun.
For example, in Mary hated her, Maryand the personal pronounher cannot be coreferential.
Thetoken representing Mary is said to be syntacticallyincompatible with the pronoun her.4) Compute the sublist L3 of L2 that contains only theelements of L2 that are semantically compatible with theforeseen pronoun.
For example, in The book is on thetable, it was published recently , the pronoun it and thetable cannot be coreferential because the direct object ofthe verb publish in the active (its subject in the passive)cannot be a piece of furniture.
The token representing thetable is said to be semantically incompatible with thepronoun it.5) According to the number of elements in L3, and maybeaccording to other considerations, decide actually if theforeseen pronoun has to be synthesized.
At a roughestimate, if the number of elements of L3 is one, then theforeseen pronoun can be synthesized since it does not leadto ambiguity, while it should not be synthesized if thenumber of elements in L3 is greater than one since itwould lead to ambiguity.
Yet, it is well known thatpragmatic and structure parallelism considerations mayallow a pronoun to be non ambiguous even if L3 has morethan one element (G. Hirst 1981, C. Sidner 1981, K.McKeown 1985, L. Danlos 1987a).
Step 5 takes thoseconsiderations into account to determine whether theforeseen pronoun has to be actually synthesized.3.1 Computation of the form of the foreseenpronounThis computation i volves the following factors :1) The syntactic position in which the token that could besynthesized as a pronoun appears.
In English, it is enoughto distinguish between the subject and complementpositions.
In French and Italian, it is necessary todistinguish between the \[subject\], [dir-objeet\], \[h-object\],\[de-object\], [lee-object\] and \[prdp-object\] positions: the\[subject\] and \[prdp-object\] positions generally give rise topronouns that are similar to the English onesl; the otherpositions may give rise to pronouns that must appearbefore the verb, such pronouns being noted Ppv .2) The person and number of the token.
Person and numberare semantic information which are given in the definitionof the token.3) The gender of the nominal phrase that synthesizes theprevious occurrence of the token.
In French and Italianlanguages, which have only the masculine and femininegender, gender is not semantic but lexieal information.Consider the token TOK1 with the following definition:TOK1 =: BICYCLENUMBER : 1DEFINITE : yesIn French, it can be synthesized as a feminine noun groupla bicyclette (the bicycle) or as a masculine noun group levdlo (the bike).
The gender of a pronoun whichsynthesizes a token is generally equal to the gender of theprevious occurrence of the token :La bicyclette st cassde.
(Elle + * ll) est au garage.
(The bicycle is broken.
It is at the garage.
)Le v~lo est cass~.
(11 + * Elle) eat au garage.
(The bike is broken.
It is at the garage.
)4) The human nature of the token along with the verb (inthe infinitive form) of the clause template.
As an example,consider the synthesis of an \[h-object\] in Italian.
Theverbs dare, pensare and credere can all take a human ornon human \[h-object\].
The form of a pronouncorresponding to the \[h-object\] of one of these three verbsis given in the table below 2 :TABLE,, 1 ~m:sHUMAN f - s  ,-i idare g l i  le .
plur .
l o e  I credere I gli I le lore pensare la lu i  I a le i  a loroNON HUMANgli 'le ioroci ci cici ci ciIn Italian as well as in French, the form of an \[h-object\]pronoun can only be obtained by consulting a "lexicon-grammar" (M. Gross 1975, 1986 ; A. Ella et ali 1981).1 In fact, an Italian \[subject\] pronoun is erased when thiserasing does not create any ambiguity.
There is no roomin this paper to discuss this complex phenomenon whichis also to be found in Spanish and Portuguese.2 The abbreviation "m-s" stands for masculine-singular, "f-s" for feminine-singular, "plur" for plural.
The pronounspreceeded by the preposition a are not placed before theverb.140For each w,.
:cb, a lexicon-granamar records all its syntacticpropert ies,  among them those concerningpronominalization.5) The synthesis of the verb.
/n French, a \[dir-objeet\] ofthe third person singular is pronominalized as le if theprevious oc~;urrence of the token is masculine, as la iffeminine :Ugo, je \[e vois souvent (Ugo, I see him often)Marie, je la vois souvent (Mary, I see her often)However, if the first letter of tile conjugated verb is avowel, there is elision of le ou la into l' :Ugo, je l'ai vu et je l'entends (Ugo, I saw him and I hearhim)Marie, je Pai vue et je l'entends (Mary, I saw her and Ihear her)This el is i(m changes the computation of themorphological antecedents of the pronoun as shown in3.2.
Therefore, i t  has to be taken into account whendetermining if the \[dir-objeet\] has to be pronominalized.6) The synthesis of other complements.
This factoriiwolves several non local dependencies.
For example, inFrench, an \[b-object\] cannot be pronominalized as the Ppv=: lui if there i s  a \[dir-objeet\] synthesized as te  (M.Gross 1968):Marie, je la pr~senterai d Ugo --> Je la luipr~venterai(Mary, I will introduce her to Ugo -> I will introduceher to him)Toi, je te prdsenterai ?tUgo --> * Je te lui pr~senterai(You, I will introduce you to Ugo --> I will introduceyou to him)Another exmnple in Italian: an \[h-object\] of the thirdperson singular can be pronominalized as gli if theprevious occurrence of the token is masculine, as le iffeminine (see Table 1).
However, if there is a \[dir-object\]synthesized as the Ppv =: 1o , the pronouns gli or leamalgamate with this Ppv and both become glie :Diedi il libro a Maria --> Le diedi il iibro( I  gave the book to Mary --> I gave the book toher)Diedi il libro a Ugo --> Gll diedi il libro(i gave the book to Ugo --> I gave the book to him)I1 libro, la diedi a (Maria + Ugo) --> Glielo diedi(The book, I gave it to (Mary + Ugo) --> I gave itto her/him)3.2 Computat ion  of the morpho log ica lantecedents of the foreseen pronounA token, which does not refer to the speaker(s) orhearer(s), eollrespends to a morphological antecedent ofthe foreseen pronoun if it has been previously synthesizedas a nominal phrase whose morphological features (i.e.gender and number) are compatible with the form of theforeseen prunoun.
For example, if the foreseen pronoun isthe French \[dir-objet\] pronoun la ,  its morphologicalantecedents are the feminine singular noun phrases;the Italian \[/i-object\] pronoun gli , it s morphologicalantecedents are the masculine singular noun phrases;tile Italian \[h-object\] pronoun le , its morphologicalantecedents are the feminine singular noun phrases;the Italian \[h-object\] pronoun glie (result of anamalgamatio~l of gli or le with another Ppv ), itsmorphologie~ anteee.xlents are the singular noun phrases.In the cases mentionned above, the computation of themorphological antccedent~ of the foreseen pronoun (i.e.the eomput~ition of the list L1) only depends upon itheform of the pronoun.
The computation o f  L1 can alsodepend upon the synthesis of other elements, therebyinvolving non local dependencies.
For example, when theforeseen pronoun is l ' ,  its morphological antecedents areall tlle singular noun phrases if the conjugated verb doesnot include a past participle as in Je l'entends (I hearhim/her/it); otherwise, its morphological antecedents arethe singular noun phrases with the gender indicated by thepast participle: in Je l'ai vu (I saw him/it), themorphological ntecedents of 1" are the masculine singularnoun phrases, while in Je l'ai rue (I saw her/it), themorphological antecedents of l' are the feminine singularnoun phrases.
This is why the synthesis of the \[dir-objeet\]depends upon that of the verb.
It is an illustration of theclaim that pronominalization i volves the morphologicallevel.Conclus ionThe cross dependencies and morphological interactionswlfieh were presented here concern only the synthesis ofpersonal pronouns, putting aside the synthesis o fsentential, subordinate and coordinated clauses.
The readercan guess the complexity of a syntactic component forRomance languages.
A robust French and Italian syntacticcomponent has been implemented in a proceduralCommon-Lisp rogram.
An English syntactic componenthas been implemented in a declarative formalism usingfunctional descriptions (J.M.
