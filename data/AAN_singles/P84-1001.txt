Multilingual Text Processing in a Two-Byte CodeLloyd B. AndersonEcological Linguistics316 "A" st. s. E.Washington, D. C., 20003ABS~ACTNational and international standards commit-tees are now discussing a two-byte code for multi-lingual information processing.
This provides for65,536 separate character and control codes, enoughto make permanent code assiguments for all the cha-ranters of ell national alphabets of the world, andalso to include Chinese/Japanese characters.This paper discusses the kinds of flexibilityrequired to handle both Roman and non-Roman alp.ha-bets.
It is crucial to separate information units(codes) from graphic forms, to maximize processingp ower,Comparing alphabets around the world, we findt.hat the graphic devices (letters, digraphs, accentmarks, punctuation, spacing, etc.)
represent a verylimited number of information units.
It is possi-ble to arr_ange alphabet codes to provide transliter-ation equivalence, the best of three solutionscompared as a _eramework for code assignments.Information vs. Form.
In developing proposalsfor codes in information processing, the most impor-tant decisions are the choices of what to code.
Ina proposal for a multilingual two-byte code, XeroxCorporation has n'~%de explicit a principle which wecan state precisely as follows:Basic codes stand for independent1.y_, function-in~ information units (not for visual forms)The choice of type font, presence or absence of se-rifs, and variations like boldface, italics orunderlining, are matters of form.
Such choices arenorrmlly made once for spans at least as long asone word.
~'\[e do not use ComPLeX miXturEs, but con-sistent strings llke this, THIS, this, or THIS.By assigning the same basic code to variations of asingle letter (as a, _~, A, A~, all variants willautomatically be alphabetized the ~ame way, whichis as it should be.
The choice of variant forms isspecified by supplementary "looks" information.
(The capitalization of first letters of sentences,proper names, or nouns, is a kind of punctuation,)Identical graphic forms may also be assignedmore than one code because they are distinct unitsin information processing.
Thus the letter form"C"' is used in the Russian alphabet to representthe sound /s/, but it is not the same informationunit as English "C", so it has a distinct code.
Sofar this seems relatively obvious.The sane principle is now being applied inmuch more subtle cases.
Thus the minus sign andthe hyphen are assigned distinct codes in recentproposals because they are completely distinct in-formation units.
There are even two kinds of hy-phens distinguished, a "hard" hyphen as in theword father-in-law, which remains always present,and a "soft" hyphen which is used only to di-vide a word at the end of a line, and which shouldautomatically vanish when, in word-processing, thesane word comes to stand undivided within the line.We can now frame the question "what to code?
"as a matter of empirical discovery, what are theindependently functioning information units intext?
Relevant facts emerge from comparing arange of different alphabets.What is a "letter of the alphabet"?
-- theproblem of diacritics and digraphs.
The mostobvious question turns out to be the most difficultof all.
Western European alphabets are in manyways not typical of alphabets of the world.
Theyhave an unusually small number of basic letters,and to represent a larger number of sounds they usedigraphs like English sh, ch, th, or diacritics asin Czech ~, ~.
It seems at first entirely obviousthat digraphs like sh should be coded simply as asequence of two codes, one for s plus one for h.Indeed English, French, German and Scandinavianalphabets do alphabetize their digraphs just likea sequence, s__ plus h etc.
But these nationalalphabets are not typical.
Spanish, Hungarian,Polish, Croatian and Albanian treat their nativedigraphs as single letters for purposes of alpha-betical order.
Spanish I I  is not & sequence oftwo l's, but a new letter which follows all io, l~usequences!
similarly ch follows all c sequences, &follows all ~ sequences as a separate letter.There is just as much variation in handlingletters" with diacritics.
The umlauted letter ~ isalphabetized as a separate letter following _o inHungarian, and at the end of the alphabet inSwedish, but in German it is mixed in with o. InSpanish, ~ is treated as a separate letter, but theSlovak ~_ ~epresenting the same sound is mixed inwith ordinary n.In Table I., the digraphs and letters withdiacritics which are not in parentheses or bracketsare alphabetized separately as distinct singleunits.
Those in parentheses are alphabetized am asequence of two or more letters or (Slovak andCzech I', n, ~ ~t', d_~ are treated as equivalent tothe simpler letter, completely disregarding thediacritic.
Combinations in brackets are used torepresent sounds in words burrowed from otherlanguages.
Double dashes mark sounds fur which anparticular alphabet has no distinctive written sym-bol.
(In Russian, palatal consonants are markedby choice of special vowel letters, while Turkishhas a different kind of contrast, hence the blanks~Even when a digraph or trigraph is treated asa sequence of letters for alphabetization, theremay be other evidence that it functions as a singleinformation unit.
In syllable division (hyphena-tion), English never divides the digraphs sh, oh,or th when they function as single units (~t~-er ,~er)  but does when they represent two ~itst-house).
The same is true of other letter com-binations in all national standard alphabets wherea single sound is represented by a combination ofletters.Within certain mechanical constraints, type-writer keyboards also put each distinct informationunit on a separate key.
Thus Spanish E mr Czech~_, _~, ~_ are Produced by single keys, n~t by ~ ga diacritic to a base letter.
Mechanical limitshave forced a sequence of two letters (like theSpanish oh, ~ to be typed with two separate key-s~rokes whether or not they represent a singlefunctional unit, but occasionally we see excep-tions, an in Dutch where the ~ digraph appears ana ligature on a single key and is printed in oneSound "space not  two.Unit tmanalyzable letters exist in Serbianand Macedonian for most of the sound types (thecolumns) of Table I. Icelandic has single letters"thorn" and "edh" for the two rightmost columns.Even where the o~her languages use digraphs crletters with diacritics, there is evidence fromsyllabification and usually also from alphabeticalorder that these are functionally independent in-formation units.
For transliteration from onenational alphabet into another, these symbol equi-valences are needed.
The im~inciple stated on thepreceding page thus implies that unique codes beavailable for English s h, c h, t_~h and unitarydigraphs in other languages so these can be usedwhen needed in information processing.
(Informa-tion processing is not the shuffling of bits ofscribal ink:) The principle does not compel useof those cedes -- English t h can be recorded firstas a sequence of two cedes, then converted into asingle cede only when needed, by a Program whichhas a dictions~y listing all wu~Is containingmatary  t_h.Spatial arrangement of printe~ characters.In al~habets of Europe, letters (and informationunits) almost always follow each other in a line,from left to right.

These vowel symbols iare independent information units,not "diacritics" in the sense of the Europeanalphabets.
They keep a constant f~rm, combiningfreely with any consonant letter.
Alphabets ofIndia and Southeast Asia place vowels above, below,to right or to left of a consonant letter or clus-ter, or in two or three of these positions simul-taneously.
There can be further combinations withmarks for tones or consonant-douBling.The Korean alphabet alanges its letters insyllabic groups, so that mascotwould be a shown to  the r ight  m a c oif ~ritten in the K~rean manner, s tThe independently functioningInfcm~ation units are still consonants and vowels,for which we need codes, and we need one additionalcode to  m~k the division between syllables.

Three basiccriteria are given first, fo l lowed by d i scuss ionof alternative solutions and further criteria.A) Each independent character or informationunit sb=11 have available a re~esentation in atwo-byte code (whether it is graphically manifestas a base letter, di6raph, independent diacritic,letter-plus-dlacritic unit, syll~ble separation,punct~tion tomsk, or other unit of normal text,and in~ep~naent of position in printing).B) It s~=11 be possible to identify the sourcealphabet from the codes themselves.
~Since "C" inCzech represents the sound /ts/, it is not the sameunit as ~ l l sh  "c"!

3C) The assignment of information units tocodes shall maximize the possibilities for use ofone-byte code reductions through long monolingualtexts, minimizing shifts between different blocksof 256 codes.
~This is especially important inreducing transmission coets.~Each of the following three solutions has cer-tain a~vantages.
The third is far superior in thelong run.Solution I.
Incorporate exlsti~ ?-bit or8-bit n~tiona I code standards, one in each blockof 256 codes.
Use the extra space as codes forinformation units which are not single spacingcharacters, This satisfies all of the basic cri-teria (A,B,C) and uses existing codes, -~d~ng onlya first byte as an a lphabet  name to  make a two-byte code.
There is no transllteration-equivalenceand elaborate transliteration programs would benecessary  f~  each convers ion ,  N x N programs fo r~_ alp~ets.Solution 2.

It appears to be economicalin Europe, where 20 national alphabets can fit in48 x 13 = 624 code cells if only letter forms areconsidered.
But for non-L&tin alphabets there canbe no similar savings.
Here there are (consideringonly l i v ing  alphabets) about 5~ alphabets based on38 distinct sets of letters.Solution ~.

This so lu t ion  depends onthe fact that there is a small number of types ofinformation units which have ever been representedin a national standard alphabet.
In the tentativearrangement of Table 3., most of the sound typesnoted ere represented by single unanalyz~ble cha-racters in some national alphabet (as Georgian,Armenian, Hindi, ...), and most of the rest byclearly unitary digraphs.
Despite the strangesymbols, this is not a list of fine phonetic dis-tinctions, it is a list of distinct categoriesof ~ritten symbols.The idea fc~ this solution came from the one-byte code adopted in India, struct~ed identicallywith transliteration-equivalence for each of thealphabets of India.

There would be a gentle encourage-ment f~  each national alphabet to use a consistenttransliteration f~ each sound independent of thesource alphabet, because this would be aatom~tlc.Summary.
