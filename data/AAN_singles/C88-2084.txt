DEF IN IT ION OF LEX ICAL  TRANSFERAl though the term lex ica l  t rans ferapp l ies  most  d i rec t ly  to mach inet rans la t ion  systems based on al ingu is t i c  model  of analys is ,  t ransfer ,and generat ion ,  it can also be app l iedto systems in which there is no d i rectcor respondance  between source and targetwords (f~uch as in ter l ingua l  systems) byde f in ing  lex ieal  t rans fer  as the pointin p rocess ing  where the target  lex ica lforms f i rst  appear.
It is the cruc ia lpo int  aL which  all the in fo rmat ionava i lab le  in the system must  be broughtto bear  on the prob lem of choos inglex ica l  forms.
The eho iees  must beappropr ia te ,  or al l  the soph is t i ca t ionof the system in other  areas such asword order  and d i scourse  markers  wi l l  beof no avai l  in p roduc ing  acceptab leoutput.Lex ica l  t ransfer  must be based onthe source text, wh ich  is genera l ly  agiven.
That is, one cannot  come backdur ing  the eva luat ion  of the output  andsuggest  that the source text be changedto bet ter  match the target  text.
Thusthe source text can be compared  to areck or to a text carved in stone.
Thetarget  text, on the other' hand, issupposed ly  somewhere  in an inf in i teco l lec t ion  of texts composed of membersof an inf in i te  set of sentencesgenerated  from a large f in i te set oflex ica l  items.
Even if one could l istin advance all the poss ib le  t rans la t ionsfor each word, which one cannot, thetask is daunt ing.
Thus the space of alltarget  language texts is a hard p lace inwhich to f ind an appropr ia te  one.
Forthose readers  not fami l ia r  with thesay ing "between a rock and a hard place"on which the t i t le of this paper isbased, I ment ion  that it refers to ad i f f i cu l t  s i tuat ion  in which allapparent  opt ions  present  problems.
Ofcourse,  the t i t le twists the saying inseveral  ways.
Its purpose  is both toemphas ize  the d i f f i cu l ty  of lexica\]t ransfer  and to i l lus t rate  it.
Thei l l us t ra t ion  is this: P lease t rans la tethe t i t le  into some other language,bas ing it on an equ iva lent  targetlanguage saying ad jus ted  to descr ibelex ica l  transfer.
It is novels i tuat ions  that make \]exica\]  t ransfert ru ly  d i f f i cu l t  to program for.2.
BACKGROUNDAt COLING86,  the author  p resented  amethodo logy  for test ing the \ ]exicalt rans fer  mechan ism of a mach inet rans la t ion  system.
S ince then, theproposed  test has been per fo rmed on anear ly  vers ion  of the DLT (D is t r ibutedLanguage Trans la t ion)  mach inet rans la t ion  system.
This  paper  wi l ldescr ibe  the resul ts  of the test.
In thecourse of per fo rming  the test, ab i l ingua l  data base of F rench andEng l i sh  texts was produced.
This database cons is ts  of pa i red  documents  with411synchron ized  paragraphs .
Th is  paperw i l l  a l so  descr ibe  the  data  base ,  wh ichhas  been ed i ted  and  i s  now ava i lab le  toqua l i f ied  researchers  fo r  a smal l  fee .3 .
TUNING DISTORTIONA good methodo logy  for test inglexical  t rans fer  must  avo id  the trap of"tuning d is tor t ion" .
Tun ing d i s to r t ionrefers to the mis lead ing  (d istorted)resul ts  obta ined  from a mach inet rans la t ion  system when its d ic t ionar iesand a lgor i thms are ad jus ted  (tuned) to apar t i cu la r  text.
A lmost  any mach inet rans la t ion  system can produce  br i l l i an tresu l ts  when the same text is runthrough it again  and aga in  wi thsuccess ive  tuning.
The power  of tun ingis ~e\ ] l -known and has been g iven a namei n  A I  research ,  namely ,  de f in ing  amierowor ld .
Cor respond ing  to  th i s  poweri s  the  we l l -known d i f f i cu l ty  o fexpand ing  a microwor ld  sys tem tofunct ion  in te l l igent ly  in  a macrowor ld .In  a mach ine  t rans la t ion  sys tem,d i f f i cu l t ies  a r i se  when a tuned sys temJs  app l ied  to  a new text .4.
THE WORD L IST  APPROACHTo avo id  tuning d i s to r t ion  in a testof lexieal  t ransfer ,  one can bu i ld  ad ic t ionary  from a word l ist w i thoutknowing  what text wi l l  be supp l iedlater, except  that it wi l l  cons is t  ofwords from the word list.
This  approachhas s ign i f i cant  advantages  oversupp ly ing  an arb i t ra ry  text andupgrad ing  the d ic t ionar ies  to handle  thetext, because  there is a consc ious  orunconsc ious  tuning of the d ic t ionaryentr ies  dur ing  the upgrade  process  solong as the text is avai lab le .In the word l ist approach,  all  thewords of the text are combined  with anumber  of mis lead ing  words which  make itd i f f i cu l t  to tel l  what is the sub jectf ie ld of the text.
Then the combinedwords are sor ted into a lphabet ica l  orderand reduced to the i r  bas ic  forms.
Thea lphabet ic  word l ist is supp l ied  to themach ine  t rans la t ion  d ic t ionary  updatersand the d ic t ionar ies  are s tab i l i zed.Then the text is p rov ided  andimmediate ly  t rans la ted  w i thout  anyupdates  to the system and w i thout  anywords miss ing  from the d ic t ionar ies .If one argues  that this methodforces the d ic t ionary  updaters  tocons ider  too many poss ib le  co l locat ionsof each word  in the list, one is s implyeompla in ing  about  the d i f f i cu l ty  ofhand l ing  real text.
At least thismethod  a l lows rea l i s t i c  tes t ing  of asystem BEFORE its d ic t ionar ies  havereached full  size.
If there is ap rob lem in the sys tem design,  it isbet ter  to f ind out wi th d ic t ionar ies  ofone thousand words and all  theirco l locat ions  than af ter  the d ic t ionar iesconta in  th i r ty  thousand words.5.
SOME RESULTS FROM THE DLT TESTThe DLT mach ine  t rans la t ion  pro jectis a venture  of the BSO company inUtrecht .
The word l ist approach  wasused to test its lex ica l  t rans fer  phaseeven before  the syntact i c  ana lys is  phasewas complete.
This was done by manua l lyana lyz ing  the test sentences.
The fourtest passages  inc luded over 2000 wordtokens which  reduced  to about 600content  word types, to which  were addedabout 200 mis lead ing  words.
The wordl ist  of about  800 words  was used tobu i ld  d ic t ionar ies  conta in ing  thousandsof entr ies.A f ter  the texts were t rans la ted  bythe DLT system from Eng l i sh  to French(dur ing the f i rst  quarter  of 1987), theywere compared  with o f f i c ia l  vers ions  ofthe texts p repared  by pro fess iona l  humant rans la tors  at the CEC.
This  compar i sonrevea led  that many  words matched theo f f i c ia l  language vers ions ,  some wereacceptab le  synonymns  and, as expected,some words were t rans la tedinappropr ia te ly .
The DLT pro ject  is becongratu la ted  on the overa l l  success  ofthe exper iment .
The prob lem words to bed i scussed  in the paper  are not in tentedto be s imply  a c r i t i c i sm of DL'r butrather  observat ions  that may be ofin terest  to all  mach ine  t rans la t ionresearchers .
Some inappropr ia tet rans la t ions  would  be eas i ly  cor rec tedby detect ing  pred ic tab le  co l locat ions .In the DLT test, the co l locat ionso f tware  was not operat iona l .
Forexample,  computer-assisted requ i res  apar t i cu la r  t rans la t ion  of assisted.Another  p rob lem is bring, which  cansomet imes  be t rans la ted  as faire venirbut which  is normal ly  t rans la ted  asprendre in the context  of the express ionbring x to y's consciousness.
Thisrequ i res  syntact i c  t rans fer  of a typethe DLT pro ject  ca l ls  metatax is  andwhich  was not imp lemented  for the test.In a recent  issue of Language Monthly(December  1987, p. 7), it was repor tedthat Peter  Lau, of the Eurot ra  project ,said, at the 1987 As l ib  conference,  thatthe real p rob lem of mach ine  t rans la t ionis not the " reduct ion  of s t ruc tura ld i f fe rences"  b~t rather  the"d i sambiguat ion  of lex ica l  entr ies" .The DLT test focussed  on such lex ica lt rans fer  problems.Some words  of in terest  f rom the testare: hardware, area, sheet, pratice,giving, perform, produce, schedule,concern, field, application, induced,lead, benefit, covers bachelor, coursesduty, and form.412For each of the above words,  the DLTsystem produced  a t rans la t ion  which  wasnot appropr ia te  to the context .
Thesewere not the only  mistakes,  but  on theother  hand, the DLT system t rans la tedthe major i ty  of the words  (60 percent)aocept~bly ,  whi le  a fourth  (25 percent)were  prob lems for one reason or another,w i th  I|~ percent  in the gray area betweenaceept?~bil i ty and unacceptab i l i ty .The reader  is inv i ted to cons iderhow these words  wou ld  be hand led  in hisor her system, be it mach inet rans l~t ion ,  content  analys is ,  or othernatura l  language process ing  system.
Howwou ld  the proper  d i s t inc t ions  be made oran appropr ia te  t rans la t ion  for thesewords  be found w i thout  be ing tuned to apar t i cu la r  text or sub language?Not surpr i s ing ly ,  the word  hardwareneeds ~ spec ia l  t rans la t ion  whenre fer r ing  to computer  hardware.
But intoday'E~ techn ica l  documents ,  there canbe re ference  to computers  but a lso tohardware  in a more genera l  sense or inre fe rence  to tools  or weapons.
How canthe appropr ia te  se lec t ion  be madew i thout  an enormous wor ld  model  and asystem which  t ru ly  unders tands  the text?
(Shades of Bar -H i l le l )  Another  exampleis the word  area, which  can bet rans la ted  r~gion or pattie.
However,these two opt ions are notin terchangeab le  and the d i s t inc t ion  issubt le  and not dependent  on pred ic tab leco l locat ions .
A sheet can be a drap (ona bed), a feuille (of paper) ,  or a lame,depend ing  on context .
Unfor tunate ly  forlexica\] t ransfer ,  the word  sheet wil lnot a lways  be fo l lowed by aprepos i t iona l  phrase ind icat ing  thecompos i t ion  of the sheet.A practice can be what  a medica ldoctor  does when t reat ing  people,  what amus ic ian  does to get ready for aconcert ,  or what  is normal ly  done insome endeavor .
These three may bet rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .The verb  form giving can refer  to at rans fer  of an ob ject  to someone or to aresu l t  ("one plus three gives four").To perform can refer  to one's  normalduty  or to a stage per fo rmance  and maybe t rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .
L ikewise,  toproduce can t rans la te  d i f fe rent ly ,depend ing  on whether  one is ta lk ingabout  a p l i y  Or factory.The reader  can use a s tandardd ic t ionary  to see the d i f f i cu l t ies  inthe fo l low ing  words: sohedule (t imetable or pr ice  l ist),  coneex~ ( interestor anx iety) ,  field ( l i tera l  area ofter ra in  or f igurat ive  f ie ld  ofinterest) ,  application ( t reatment  orlevel of effort), induced (social  ore lec t romagnet ic  pressure) ,  lead (a wireor a sales contact) ,  benefit (advantageor government  payment) ,  cover (l id orabst ract  l imit),  duty (ob l igat ion  orimport  tax), and course (path oraoadmemic  class).Two of the words in the l ist involvean e lement  of poet ic  just ice.
Katz andFodor d i s t ingu ished  the academic  degreeand unmarr ied  man read ings  of bachelorwith markers,  but d id not tel l  DLT howto d i s t ingu ish  between them when theword is encountered  in text.
And thet rans la t ion  of form depends  on its(~ontent.6.
THE BIL INGUAL DATA BASEPre l iminary  to the DLT test, acorpus  of texts  was gathered  to ass is tin d ic t ionary  deve lopment .
A por t ion  ofthe corpus  was kept secret  and the testpassages  were chosen from this port ion.A larger  por t ion  was made ava i lab le  tothe DLT pro jec t  for lex ica l  studies.The Water loo  concordance  system was Usedto generate  KWIC l i s t ings  for thelex icographers  to observe  the var ioususes of words in actua l  texts.The b i l ingua l  data base used in thetest was der ived  from publ ic  domaindocuments  of the CEC and the Un i tedNat ions,  to avo id  copyr ight  problems.It cons is ts  of twenty  documents ,  eachwith an Eng l i sh  and a French vers ion,  onsub jects  rang ing from migrant  workers  tothe ESA space lab  to the automobi leindust ry  to agr icu l ture .
The documentswere f i rst  scanned us ing a Kurzwei l  OCRdevice.
Then the d isk  f i les were hand-ed i ted into 400 smal l  synchron izedfi les, 200 Eng l i sh  and 200 French,represent ing  a total  of about  e ightmegabytes  of data (i.e.
over one mi l l i onwords) .
As of this wr i t ing,  the smallf i les are be ing fur ther  proofed  aga instthe or ig ina l  documents ,  and theparagraphs  or other  logica l  un i ts  of thetexts are be ing  synchron ized  by ed i t ingin segment  number  marks.
These marksare used by a s imple preprocess ingprogram to produce  synchron ized  two-co lumn b i l ingua l  output  for indexing byWordCruncher ,  a new dynamic  concordancesystem which  has become ava i lab le  s incethe pro ject  began.
This  two-co lumnformat wi l l  fac i l i ta te  the study of al loccur rences  of words or express ions  withthe other  language segment  automat ica l lyd i sp layed  to a l low the researcher  toqu ick ly  see how that word or express ionwas t rans la ted  in the corpus.The ed i ted  corpus is ava i lab le  withpermiss ion  of BSO for a modest  fee toqua l i f i ed  researchers .
It is hoped thatthe corpus,  the word  l ist methodo logy ,and the resu l ts  of the DLT test wi l l  beof use to others  in the machinet rans la t ion  community .413
