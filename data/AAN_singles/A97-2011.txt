Microsoft Natural Language Understanding System andGrammar CheckerSteve RichardsonMicrosoft ResearchOne Microsoft WayRedmond, WA 98052steveri @ microsoft.comThe Natural Language Processing (NLP)group at Microsoft Research has beenworking for over five years on thedevelopment of a broad-coverage NLunderstanding system.
In the last twoyears, the NLP group has been joined bythe World Languages Research group,whose current mission is to extend theNLP group's technology to bothEuropean and Far-Eastern languages,and by the Natural LanguageDevelopment group, which isresponsible for transferring thetechnology into Microsoft products.The presentation will provide a briefoverview and demonstration of thecomponents hat comprise the MicrosoftNLP technology, including the syntacticparser, logical form component, andlexical knowledge base (MindNet).There will also be a description of howthe three NL groups at Microsoft havecollaborated successfully to move thetechnology into real world products.In particular, the grammar checkerintegrated in Microsoft Word 97 (alsoincluded in Office 97), which wasreleased in January of this year,incorporates the NLP group's syntacticparser.
It is envisioned that this verygeneral and flexible component, ogetherwith the other components underdevelopment, will provide the basis formany NL-enabled functions as well asspecific applications other than grammarchecking.The grammar checker will bedemonstrated in the context of Word 97,showing a number of the errors it detectsand some of the rewrites it suggests.Some usability and integration issues,such as background processing, will alsobe discussed.
Finally, there will be abrief demonstration of the grammarchecking functionality in the context ofthe more general NL understandingsystem.Publications describing the work of theNLP group at Microsoft Research maybe accessed on the World Wide Web at:http://www.research.microsoft.com/20
