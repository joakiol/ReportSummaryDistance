uk1 In t roduct ionRecognition of proper nouns in Japanese text hasbeen studied as a part of the more general problem ofmorphological nalysis in Japanese text processing(\[1\] [2\]).
It has also been studied in the framework ofJapanese information extraction (\[3\]) in recent years.Our approach to the Multi-lingual EvaluationTask (MET) for Japanese text is to consider thegiven task as a morphological nalysis problem inJapanese.
Our morphological nalyzer has done allthe necessary work for the recognition and classi-fication of proper names, numerical and temporalexpressions, i.e.
Named Entity (NE) items in theJapanese text.The analyzer is called "Amorph".
Amorph rec-ognizes NE items in two stages: dictionary lookupand rule application.
First, it uses several kinds ofdictionaries to segment and tag Japanese characterstrings.
Second, based on the information resultingfrom the dictionary lookup stage, a set of rules isapplied to the segmented strings in order to identifyNE items.
When a segment is found to be an NEitem, this information is added to the segment andit is used to generate the final output 1.2 System Description2.1 System OverviewThe main processes in the Amorph system are asfollows:1.
A basic morphological nalysis is carried outon the input text using a simple dictionary.Part-of-speech information is added to the text.Since proper noun is not one of the parts ofspeech, all the nouns are tagged simply as noun.2.
Three proper noun dictionaries (organization,person, location) are consulted for each noun inthe text.
If there is an exact match between anoun in the text and an item in one of thesedictionaries, the noun is tagged as such.3.
A "co-occurrence" (kyoukigo) dictionary whichis a collection of key words is consulted.
These~Wakao is a visiting researcher at NEC InformationTechnology Research Labs in 1996key words are words which indicate that the seg-ment is a part of a Named Entity item, or thesegment is immediately before or after an NEitem.
When such a key word is found, it ismarked as such.4.
A set of rules for each type of NE items (or-ganization, person, location, date, time, money,percent) is applied to the result so far.
Someorganization names are recorded temporarily inthe system to identify the names which appearsomewhere else in the text (name learning).
Ifa segment (or segments) is judged to be an NEitem by some rule or name learning, then it ismarked so.5.
Finally the output generation module producesthe final output, marking NE items in the textwith the specified SGML markup.The use of dictionaries (or lists) of proper namesand key words, and the application of rules based onthe dictionary lookup have also been adopted in theSheffield English MUC-6 system (\[4\]).Figure 1 shows the overview of the Amorph sys-tem illustrating how the input text is processed.Input TextI Morphological \] ~.---I Am?rph \[Analysis (Basic) DictionaryProp~Noun J "~"'-\[ ProperNoun Lookup DiaionaryIKeyw?rd } I Key w?rd Lookup ~ DictionaryI Applica~onOutput \] Proper Noun Generation Extra.ionTagged Text (Output)Figure 1: Amorph System Overview4753 D ic t ionar iesThe Amorph system uses three proper noun dictio-naries and a key word dictionary.
Table 1 shows thesize of the proper noun dictionaries.. the segments are a Kanji-, Katakana-, oralphabet-character-only string and followed bya specific expression such as " (~:~J:" (head-quarters), they are judged to be an organizationname.Type SizeLocation 10438Organization 2544Person 8223Total 21205Table h Size of Proper Noun DictionariesThe key word dictionary has 785 items in total.For example, "$"  (city) is a key word for a locationname, "gk :~"  (President) for a person name, and"~J:" (Company) for an organization ame.
It has61 key words for location, 324 for organization, 351for person, and 49 for number and time expressions.Table 2 shows the sizes of key words for differenttypes of the NE items.Type SizeLocation 61Organization 324Person 351Number and Time 49Table 2: Details of Key Word Dictionary4 Ext rac t ion  Ru lesA set of rules is applied to the text after the dic-tionary lookup is done.
These rules have been pro-duced manually in order to capture different ypesof proper names as well as number and temporalexpressions in the text.The Japanese language has four different kindsof characters: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji (Chinesecharacters), and alphabetic haracters, besides nu-merical and punctuation symbols.
Some of the rulesbelow use this feature, i.e.
what kind of charactersthe given string is made of.Here are some rules for person and organizationnames.1.
if the segment is positioned immediately beforeor after a person key word, and it is marked aseither location or ambiguous between locationand person name, then it is recognized as per-sort.e.g.
"~.~" :  "~"  (Chiba) is ambiguous be-tween location and person name, but since it isfollowed by a person key word, "~" (Mr. inthis case), "~"  is recognized as person.e.g.
"N E C (2g~J:~" (NEC, headquarters inTokyo): "N E C" is an alphabet-character-onlystring and recognized as an organization name.5 Name learn ingWhen a segment (or a set of segments) is recognizedas organization ame and at the same time it is anMphabet-character-only or katakana-character-onlystring, the system records it temporarily and use itto recognize appearances of the name in other placesin the text.For example, a katakana-character-only string,)~ ~ ~ ?
~ Y 7 (Mercedes Benz) is once recognizedas organization ame, both segments ( .~)P~'~and ~ 'Y )  are remembered as organization ameto capture later appearances of the name (.~ }1~.7, in this case) in the text.This mechanism of learning names is useful forrecognizing organization names in the headline sinceorganization names tend to be in shortened forms inthe headline and their full names appear in the bodyof the text.6 AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Mr. Miyabe of NEC for hishelp in data analysis.
