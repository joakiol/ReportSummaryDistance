kvs2811@yahoo.comAbstractResearch in Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagsetdesign for European and East Asian lan-guages started with a mere listing of impor-tant morphosyntactic features in one lan-guage and has matured in later years to-wards hierarchical tagsets, decomposabletags, common framework for multiple lan-guages (EAGLES) etc.
Several tagsetshave been developed in these languagesalong with large amount of annotated datafor furthering research.
Indian Languages(ILs) present a contrasting picture withvery little research in tagset design issues.We present our work in designing a com-mon POS-tagset framework for ILs, whichis the result of in-depth analysis of eightlanguages from two major families, viz.Indo-Aryan and Dravidian.
Our frameworkfollows hierarchical tagset layout similar tothe EAGLES guidelines, but with signifi-cant changes as needed for the ILs.1 IntroductionA POS tagset design should take into considerationall possible morphosyntactic categories that canoccur in a particular language or group of languag-es (Hardie, 2004).
Some effort has been made inthe past, including the EAGLES guidelines formorphosyntactic annotation (Leech and Wilson,1996) to define guidelines for a common tagsetacross multiple languages with an aim to capturemore detailed morphosyntactic features of theselanguages.However, most of the tagsets for ILs are lan-guage specific and cannot be used for tagging datain other language.
This disparity in tagsets hindersinteroperability and reusability of annotated corpo-ra.
This further affects NLP research in resourcepoor ILs where non-availability of data, especiallytagged data, remains a critical issue for researchers.Moreover, these tagsets capture the morphosyntac-tic features only at a shallow level and miss out thericher information that is characteristic of theselanguages.The work presented in this paper focuses on de-signing a common tagset framework for Indianlanguages using the EAGLES guidelines as a mod-el.
Though Indian languages belong to (mainly)four distinct families, the two largest being Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, as languages that have beenin contact for a long period of time, they share sig-nificant similarities in morphology and syntax.This makes it desirable to design a common tagsetframework that can exploit this similarity to facili-tate the mapping of different tagsets to each other.This would not only allow corpora tagged withdifferent tagsets for the same language to be reusedbut also achieve cross-linguistic compatibility be-tween different language corpora.
Most important-ly, it will ensure that common categories of differ-ent languages are annotated in the same way.In the next section we will discuss the impor-tance of a common standard vis-?-vis the currentlyavailable tagsets for Indian languages.
Section 3will provide the details of the design principlesThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200889behind the framework presented in this paper.
Ex-amples of tag categories in the common frameworkwill be presented in Section 4.
Section 5 will dis-cuss the current status of the paper and future stepsenvisaged.2 Common Standard for POS TagsetsSome of the earlier POS tagsets were designedfor English (Greene and Rubin, 1981; Garside,1987; Santorini, 1990) in the broader context ofautomatic parsing of English text.
These tagsetspopular even today, though designed for the samelanguage differ significantly from each other mak-ing the corpora tagged by one incompatible withthe other.
Moreover, as these are highly languagespecific tagsets they cannot be reused for any otherlanguage without substantial changes this requiresstandardization of POS tagsets (Hardie 2004).Leech and Wilson (1999) put forth a strong argu-ment for the need to standardize POS tagset forreusability of annotated corpora and interopera-bility across corpora in different languages.EAGLES guidelines (Leech and Wilson 1996)were a result of such an initiative to create stan-dards that are common across languages that sharemorphosyntactic features.Several POS tagsets have been designed by anumber of research groups working on IndianLanguages though very few are available publicly(IIIT-tagset, Tamil tagset).
However, as each ofthese tagsets have been motivated by specific re-search agenda, they differ considerably in terms ofmorphosyntactic categories and features, tag defi-nitions, level of granularity, annotation guidelinesetc.
Moreover, some of the tagsets (Tamil tagset)are language specific and do not scale across otherIndian languages.
This has led to a situation wheredespite strong commonalities between the lan-guages addressed resources cannot be shared dueto incompatibility of tasgets.
This is detrimental tothe development of language technology for Indianlanguages which already suffer from a lack of ade-quate resources in terms of data and tools.In this paper, we present a common frameworkfor all Indian languages where an attempt is madeto treat equivalent morphosyntactic phenomenaconsistently across all languages.
The hierarchicaldesign, discussed in detail in the next section, alsoallows for a systematic method to annotate lan-guage particular categories without disregardingthe shared traits of the Indian languages.3 Design PrinciplesWhilst several large projects have been concernedwith tagset development very few have touchedupon the design principles behind them.
Leech(1997), Cloeren (1999) and Hardie (2004) aresome important examples presenting universalprinciples for tagset design.In this section we restrict the discussion to theprinciples behind our tagset framework.
Important-ly, we diverge from some of the universal prin-ciples but broadly follow them in a consistent way.Tagset structure: Flat tagsets just list down thecategories applicable for a particular languagewithout any provision for modularity or featurereusability.
Hierarchical tagsets on the other handare structured relative to one another and offer awell-defined mechanism for creating a commontagset framework for multiple languages whileproviding flexibility for customization according tothe language and/ or application.Decomposability in a tagset alows different fea-tures to be encoded in a tag by separate sub-stings.Decomposable tags help in better corpus analysis(Leech 1997) by allowing to search with an un-derspecified search string.In our present framework, we have adopted thehierarchical layout as well as decomposable tagsfor designing the tagset.
The framework will havethree levels in the hierarchy with categories, types(subcategories) and features occupying the top,medium and the bottom layers.What to encode?
One thumb rule for the POStagging is to consider only the aspects of morpho-syntax for annotation and not that of syntax, se-mantics or discourse.
We follow this throughoutand focus only on the morphosyntactic aspects ofthe ILs for encoding in the framework.Morphology and Granularity: Indian languag-es have complex morphology with varying degreeof richness.
Some of the languages such as those ofthe Dravidian family also display agglutination asan important characteristic.
This entails that mor-phological analysis is a desirable pre-process forthe POS tagging to achieve better results in auto-matic tagging.
We encode all possible morphosyn-tactic features in our framework assuming the exis-The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200890tence of morphological analysers and leave thechoice of granularity to users.As pointed out by Leech (1997) some of thelinguistically desirable distinctions may not befeasible computationally.
Therefore, we ignorecertain features that may not be computationallyfeasible at POS tagging level.Multi-words: We treat the constituents of Mul-ti-word expressions (MWEs) like Indian SpaceResearch Organization as individual words and tagthem separately rather than giving a single tag tothe entire word sequence.
This is done because:Firstly, this is in accordance with the standardpractice followed in earlier tagsets.
Secondly,grouping MWEs into a single unit should ideallybe handled in chunking.Form vs. function: We try to adopt a balancebetween form and function in a systematic andconsistent way through deep analysis.
Based onour analysis we propose to consider the form innormal circumstances and the function for wordsthat are derived from other words.
More details onthis will be provided in the framework document(Baskaran et al2007)Theoretical neutrality: As Leech (1997) pointsout the annotation scheme should be theoreticallyneutral to make it clearly understandable to a largergroup and for wider applicability.Diverse Language families: As mentioned ear-lier, we consider eight languages coming from twomajor language families of India, viz.
Indo-Aryanand Dravidian.
Despite the distinct characteristicsof these two families, it is however striking to notethe typological parallels between them, especiallyin syntax.
For example, both families follow SOVpattern.
Also, several Indo-Aryan languages suchas Marathi, Bangla etc.
exhibit some agglutination,though not to the same extent of Dravidian.
Giventhe strong commonalities between the two familieswe decided to use a single framework for them4 POS Tagset Framework for Indian lan-guagesThe tagset framework is laid out at the followingfour levels similar to EAGLES.I.
Obligatory attributes or values are generallyuniversal for all languages and hence must beincluded in any morphosyntactic tagset.
Themajor POS categories are included here.II.
Recommended attributes or values are recog-nised to be important sub-categories and fea-tures common to a majority of languages.III.
Special extensions1a.
Generic attributes or valuesb.
Language-specific attributes or values arethe attributes that are relevant only for few lan-guages and do not apply to most languages.All the tags were discussed and debated in detailby a group of linguists and computer scien-tists/NLP experts for eight Indian languages viz.Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi,Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu.Now, because of space constraints we presentonly the partial tagset framework.
This is just toillustrate the nature of the framework and the com-plete version as well as the rationale for differentcategories/features in the framework can be foundin Baskaran et al (2007).2In the top level the following 12 categories areidentified as universal categories for all ILs andhence these are obligatory for any tagset.1.
[N] Nouns 7.
[PP] Postpositions2.
[V] Verbs  8.
[DM] Demonstratives3.
[PR] Pronouns  9.
[QT] Quantifiers4.
[JJ] Adjectives  10.
[RP] Particles5.
[RB] Adverbs  11.
[PU] Punctuations6.
[PL] Participles  12.
[RD] Residual3The partial tagset illustrated in Figure 1 high-lights entries in recommended and optional catego-ries for verbs and participles marked for three le-vels.4 The features take the form of attribute-valuepairs with values in italics and in some cases (suchas case-markers for participles) not all the valuesare fully listed in the figure.5 Current Status and Future WorkIn the preceding sections we presented a commonframework being designed for POS tagsets for In-dian Languages.
This hierarchical framework has1We do not have many features defined under the specialextensions and this is mainly retained for any future needs.2 Currently this is just the draft version and the final versionwill be made available soon3 For words or segments in the text occurring outside the gam-bit of grammatical categories like foreign words, symbols,etc.4  These are not finalised as yet and there might be somechanges in the final version of the framework.The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200891three levels to permit flexibility and interoperabili-ty between languages.
We are currently involved ina thorough review of the present framework byusing it to design the tagset for specific Indian lan-guages.
The issues that come up during thisprocess will help refine and consolidate theframework further.
In the future, annotation guide-lines with some recommendations for handlingambiguous categories will also be defined.
Withthe common framework in place, it is hoped thatresearchers working with Indian Languages wouldbe able to not only reuse data annotated by eachother but also share tools across projects and lan-guages.ReferencesBaskaran S. et al 2007.
