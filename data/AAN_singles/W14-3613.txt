Our TunDiaWN constructionapproach is founded, in one hand, on acorpus based method to analyze and ex-tract Tunisian dialect words.
A clusteringtechnique is adapted and applied to minethe possible relations existing betweenthe Tunisian dialect extracted words andto group them into meaningful groups.All these suggestions are then evaluatedand validated by the experts to performthe resource enrichment task.
We reuseother Wordnet versions, mainly for Eng-lish and Arabic language to propose anew database structure enriched by inno-vative features and entities.1 IntroductionThe Arabic Dialects have become increasinglyused in social networks and web 2.0 (blogs, fo-rums, newspaper, newsgroups, etc.)
instead ofStandard Arabic (SA).Consequently, new kinds of texts appeared beingmainly dialect-written or having a mixture be-tween Arabic Dialects and Standard Arabic.Thus, innovative opportunities and challengesarise when we try to deal with the automatic pro-cessing of such data in order to seek out usefulinformation and take advantages of their growingavailability and popularity.
The NLP approachesgenerally applied lexical resources for the targetlanguage.
Such resources are useful in severaltasks which involve a language meaning under-standing like: opinion mining (Kim et al., 2004;Bouchlaghem et al.
2010), information retrieval(Valeras et al., 2005; Rosso et al., 2004), queryexpansion (Parapar et al., 2005), text categoriza-tion (Rosso et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al.,2003), and many other applications.However, this situation poses significant difficul-ties in the context of dialectal data because of thehuge lack of Dialect-Standard Arabic lexical re-sources.
Building similar ones is a big challengesince spoken dialects are not officially written,don?t have a standard orthography and are con-sidered as under-resourced languages, unlikestandard languages.In this paper, we address the problem of creatinga linguistic resource for an Arabic dialect.
Wedescribe our approach towards building a Word-net for Tunisian dialect (TD).
We proceed, first-ly, to construct a TD corpus by collecting datafrom various resources (social networks, web-sites, TD dictionaries, etc.).
We develop a clus-tering based method that aims to organize the TDcorpus words by grouping them into clusters.The suggested organization possibilities are,then, analyzed and validated by the TD expertsduring the TunDiaWN enrichment process.
Ourproposed database structure is designed to beable to highlight the specificities of the TD lexi-con.
It also takes advantage of Arabic Wordnet(AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), the Arabic versionof the widely used lexico-semantic resourcePrinceton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).This can be justified by the assumption that Tu-nisian Arabic has a great resemblance withStandard Arabic.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: webegin by presenting works related to existingwordnets and approaches focused on the auto-Rim FaizLARODEC, IHEC de Carthage,2016 Carthage Pr?sidence, TunisieRim.Faiz@ihec.rnu.tn104matic processing of the Tunisian dialect.
We thenintroduce the posed challenges and the hypothe-sis we have assumed in building the TunDiaWN.In the next section, we proceed to explain andjustify the proposed approach for developing theinitial version of the Tunisian Arabic lexical re-source.
Firstly, we detail the TD data collect pro-cess and the MultiTD corpus construction.
Sec-ondly, we present the method developed to sug-gest possible organizations of TD words extract-ed from the corpus.
Then, we describe the pro-posed structure of TunDiaWN, especially thenew added features and entities as well as thevalidation task performed by the TD experts.
Inthe following section, we perform a linguisticanalysis by reporting significant observationsrelated to TD-SA discovered during the enrich-ment process.
Conclusion and future works arepresented in section 5.2 Related worksThe first version of wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998)was developed for English at Princeton Universi-ty.
It?s a large lexical database where words hav-ing the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjec-tives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitivesynonyms (synsets), each one expressing a dis-tinct concept.
Each word can belong to one ormore synsets.
The resulting synsets are connect-ed by means of conceptual-semantic and lexicalrelations well labeled such as hyponymy and an-tonymy.The success of the Princeton WordNet has moti-vated the development of similar resources forother languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN(Vossen, 1998) interlinking wordnets of severalEuropean languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish,German, French, Czech and Estonian); Balkanet(Tufis, 2004) comprising wordnets of the Balkanlanguages; and recently Arabic Wordnet (AWN)(Elkateb et al., 2006).AWN was released following methods devel-oped for EuroWordNet.
These methods revolveabout the manual encoding of a set of CommonBase Concepts (CBC), the most important con-cepts from the 12 languages in EWN and Bal-kaNet.
Other language-specific concepts are add-ed and translated manually to the closest syn-set(s) in Arabic.
Such resource aims to link ara-bic words and synsets to english ones.AWN is related to the Classical Arabic(or Literal Arabic) which refers to the officialstandard form of the Arabic language used inArab world.
Other variants of Arabic are dialectswhich are spoken and informal.
They are theprimary form of Arabic Language.The Tunisian dialect (cf.

Examples of popular TD wordsMost of the works that dealt with the automaticprocessing of Tunisian dialect are based on spo-ken dialogue corpus.
To mention, Graja et al.
(2011) performed a lexical study of manual tran-scription of conversations recorded in the railwaystation for understanding speech.
The applicationis domain dependant and, thus, the vocabulary islimited.
Moreover, Zribi et al.
(2013) introduceda lexicon for the Tunisian dialect in order toadapt an existing morphological analyzer initial-ly designed for Standard Arabic.
Although themethod shows good results, the proposed lexiconis far to be complete.
Boujelbane et al.
(2013)presented a method that aims to construct bilin-gual dictionary using explicit knowledge aboutthe relation between Tunisian dialect and Stand-ard Arabic.
This approach was limited to theverbs.3 ChallengesIn the last years, Tunisian dialect is widely usedin new written media and web 2.0, especially insocial networks, blogs, forums, weblogs, etc., inaddition to conversational media (Diab et al.,2007).Thinking about building a wordnet for Tunisiandialect is a big challenge.
In fact, like most ofdialects around the world, Tunisian Arabic isconsidered as spoken language with no conven-tional written form.
Moreover, there is a lack ofTunisian dialect-Standard Arabic resources andtools.Recently, Cavalli-Sforza et al.
(2013) proposed aprocess for creating a basic Iraqi Dialect Word-Net.
This work is based on other languageswordnets as well as a bidirectional English-IraqiArabic dictionary.
To our knowledge, no otheropen source Wordnet for the Standard Arabic orArabic Dialect has been developed to date.To deal with these difficulties, we decide to pro-duce a TD corpus gathering texts from multiple105sources.
This corpus provides a useful startingpoint for building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect.We assume that Arabic Dialects can be presumedto be similar to Standard Arabic, particularly intheir conceptual organization.
Indeed, the Tuni-sian dialect has a sophisticated form which com-bines Standard Arabic and Tunisian dialect spe-cific forms.
It has a great resemblance to the SAand adds some variances such as foreign wordsborrowed from other languages.
Thus, given thesimilarities between the TD and the SA, the re-sources available to SA, such as AWN, can befavorably used for creating Tunisian dialectalresources.4 Proposed approach for TunDiaWNconstructionThe classical building WordNets methodologiesstart from the CBC, and then make changesaccording to the concerned language.We propose a new corpus-based approach to cre-ate WordNet resource for Tunisian dialect, whichdeviates from the strategies commonly adopted.As shows Figure 1, our approach is performed infour steps:a. Tunisian dialect textual data collect: it con-sists in producing our MultiTD corpus (Mul-ti-source Tunisian dialect corpus) whichgathers TD texts from many sources: socialnetworks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.
), writtenpieces  of theater, dictionaries, transcriptionsof spontaneous speech, etc.b.
TD words extraction: is to preprocess theproduced corpus in order to preserve usefuldata and extract TD words.c.
TD words clustering: we propose here a clus-tering based method that aims to group theextracted TD words into meaningful clusters,which represent great suggestions for possibleenrichments of TunDiaWN.d.
TunDiaWN enrichment: this step is performedby the TD experts.
It includes the manual val-idation of the suggestions proposed by theprevious step.
We propose, in this stage, anew database structure for TunDiaWN.
Theexperts have to add the necessary featuresvalues, particularly the TD specific attributes(details in section 4.4).4.1 TD data collection and MultiTD corpuspresentationWe set out to collect data for Tunisian dialect inorder to address the general lack of resources, onthe one hand, and to produce a multi sourcecorpus, on the other.We created the MultiTD corpus by gathering TDdata from diverse sources.The most practical source of TD texts is onlinedata, which is more individual-driven and lessformal, and consequently more likely to com-prise dialectal contents.Figure 1.
Proposed approach of TunDiaWN building106We automatically collected a great amount of TDtexts from user?s comments and status fromTwitter, Facebook and TripAdviser.We have implemented three specific modules:?
TwtterCollecter based on Twitter4j java  api,?
FacebookAspirator using a PHP script and aFacebook account developer,?
TripadvisorScreen a java module to analyzeTripadvisor web pages and extract commentsforms.Manual transcriptions of TD recorded spontane-ous speech are also added to the MultiTD corpus.Such data allows highlighting the Tunisian ac-cent in the dialogue and, therefore, enriching thecorpus by new varieties of the TD lexicon.Other online available TD resources are used toenrich the MultiTD corpus.
We cite notably, theKarmous dictionary for Tunisian Arabic1 whichcomprises more than 3,800 TD words and sever-al Tunisian proverbs and expressions organizedby themes.We use also an online TD dictionary 2 consistingof over 4,000 words and expressions; and manyshort TD texts3 related to various areas: songs,theater, newspaper articles, etc.4.2 TD words extractionTo successfully extract all TD words, the inputtexts must be preprocessed.
In our study, the pre-processing consists, firstly, to clean the inputfiles so as to identify the textual content.
Thecleaned texts are then segmented in order to ex-tract all existing TD words.Cleaning a raw textual source is necessary in ourapproach because the documents are collectedfrom the Web.
All non-textual data such as im-ages, advertisements, scripts, etc.
have to beeliminated.
For this purpose, we have developeda module that removes all unwanted parts fromthe input documents.The cleaned texts are then segmented into ele-mentary textual units and the obtained TD wordsare extracted and stored in CSV files.The Table 2 gives statistics about the TD wordscomposing the MultiTD corpus.1 The dictionary can be obtained from :  http://www.fichierpdf.fr/2010/08/31/m14401m/dico-karmous.pdf2 Link : http://www.arabetunisien.com/3 Download link: http://www.langue-arabe.fr/spip.php?article25TD words countSocialnetwoksTwitter 10249Facebook 7470Tripadvisor 3258TD transcripts texts 2351Other sources (pieces oftheatre, dictionaries, etc.)

Distribution of TD wordsin MultiTD corpus, according to sources4.3 TD words clustering using k-modesalgorithmThe TunDiaWN construction is based on a semi-automatic process in which the validation tasksperformed by experts are crucial.As Table 2 Shows, the MultiTD corpus includesa huge number of TD words.
The manual analy-sis and organization of such large data lookswasteful and time consuming.In order to support experts in the organizationand validation tasks and guide them during theconstruction process, we propose a clustering-based method to automatically arrange the TDwords set into groups.
The method aims to sug-gest possible organizations of the given TDwords by gathering them into meaningful clus-ters.To enhance similarities and meanings into theproduced groups, we propose to cluster the TDwords according to their TD roots.
We rely hereon the derivational morphology that characteriz-es the Tunisian dialect as well as the StandardArabic.In fact, many SA words having a common root 4can be derived from a base verbal form and haverelated meanings.
An example of such a field forthe root ??

(Elkateb et al., 2006)In the same context, the TD morphology is deri-vational too (cf.
Table 4).Taking advantage of this central characteristic,the set of TD words can be organized into dis-tinct semantic groups according to the TD rootsfrom which they are derived.

?We don?t search here to automatically enrich theTunDiaWN structure by attaching new TDwords, but we rather suggest new attachmentsand enrichment possibilities which can help theexperts.Our aim at this step is to group words having thesame root.
To do this task, we apply and adaptthe K-modes clustering algorithm (Huang, 1997).The K-modes algorithm extends K-means (For-gy, 1965; MacQueen, 1967) paradigm to clustercategorical data by removing the numeric datalimitation.
Indeed, the K-modes algorithm intro-duces a new simple matching dissimilarity meas-ure for categorical data objects.
The algorithmreplaces means of clusters with modes, and usesa frequency based method to update modes in theclustering process.The choice of K-modes clustering algorithm ismainly motivated because of its widely use inreal world applications due to its efficiency indealing with large categorical database (He et al.,2011).
K-modes algorithm is also faster than oth-er clustering algorithms (mainly k-means) sinceit needs less iteration to produce a stable distribu-tion.
.The K-modes algorithm requires a similaritymeasurement to be used between the objects.
Inour case, we propose to use the N-Gram similari-ty measurement between words.
N-Gram is lan-guage independent in nature and doesn?t requirespecific resources to be applied.
Therefore, N-gram model seems suitable for dealing with aTunisian dialect context.
We applied the N-Gramdistance proposed by Kondrak (2005) and weused the implementation provided by ApacheLucene spellchecking API5.The K-modes algorithm consists of the followingsteps:a) Select K initial modes, one for each of thecluster.5The project can be freely obtained from:http://lucene.apache.org/core/b) Allocate data object to the cluster whose modeis nearest to it, according to the simple matchingdissimilarityc) Compute new modes of all clusters.d) Repeat step b to c until no data object haschanged cluster membership.The classical K-modes algorithm assumes thatthe number of clusters, K, is known in advanceand the clusters?
modes are randomly initialized.The K-modes algorithm is very sensitive to thesechoices and an improper choice may then yieldhighly undesirable cluster structures.
(Khan etal., 2013).In order to deal with these drawbacks and, there-after, maximize the performance of the algo-rithm, we propose a new initialization strategyfor the k-modes algorithm.Indeed, since our goal is to cluster words accord-ing to their roots, the TD roots are assigned toclusters modes in the initialization step instead ofrandom initialization.
The number of clusters (K)will, thus, take the cardinality of the target TDroots set.
Therefore, the K-modes algorithmstarts with k clusters each having as mode oneroot among the TD roots list initially translated.We have also adopted a new strategy based onthe N-Gram similarity measurement to updateclusters?
modes.
The modes update is performedat the end of each iteration.
For each cluster, theitem qualified as new cluster mode must maxim-ize the similarity sum with the rest of cluster ob-jects.The K-modes algorithm adapted for our purposeperforms as following:a. InitializationK = |set of TD roots|Initial modes = TD roots, one for each of thecluster.b.
Allocate each word (itmi) of TD words set tothe cluster Clusters whose mode ModeCLs isnearest to it according to the equation (1) :ModeCLs=argmin     (1-simNGram(itmi, ModeCLs))c. Update modes of all clusters  :KsClusters ?=?

Repeat step (b) to (c) until no TD words haschanged cluster membership.After performing the new proposed version ofthe k mode algorithm, the obtained results aresuggested to be validated by the TD experts inorder to enrich TunDiaWN structure, which willbe presented in the next section.4.4 TD groups?
validation and TunDiaWNenrichmentIn this section, we begin by describing the pro-posed structure of TunDiaWN.
After that, wedetail the enrichment task performed by the TDexperts.
Then, we present a linguistic study per-formed during the enrichment process.TunDiaWN structureAs our target language is an Arabic Dialect andtherefore likely to share many of the StandardArabic concepts, we decide to preserve the AWNdesign.
However, the AWN current structure isunable to support the specificities of the Tunisiandialect lexicon.
The proposed TunDiaWN struc-ture is then enriched by new features, entities andrelations.
Moreover, we aim to create a parallelresource which maintains the linkage betweenTunisian dialectal, Arabic as well as Englishsynsets and words.
That?s why AWN and PWNcontents are preserved rather than the structures.Thus, the proposed database is designed to beable to support English, Tunisian and StandardArabic content and correspondence.In this section, we detail the structure of the pro-posed TunDiaWN database and we focus on thenew features we added to keep up the TD vocab-ulary particularities, compared to the SA andEnglish ones.TWN entity typesThe database structure incorporates mainly thefollowing entity types: synset, word, form, synsetrelations, words relations, annotator:Synset: includes English and Arabic synsets.
Asynset has descriptive information such as Name,POS (Part Of Speech), root (Boolean feature in-dicating if the target synset is a root or not).Word: comprises words from different lan-guages.
In addition to the unique identifier, everyword is described by his value, and a Boolean?valid?
attribute which indicates if one word isalready validated by experts or not yet.Form: includes mainly the root of Arabic as wellas Tunisian dialect words.Synsets relations: includes links relating twosynsets, like ?has_instance?, ?equivalent?,?similar?, etc.
We preserve here all sunsets?
linkswithout adding new ones.Words relations: two English words can belinked by ?pertainym?
or ?antonym?
relations.There are no added Arabic words relations.Annotator: is used to indicate who has validatedeach word.
The attribute ?region?
helps to classi-fy words by region and identify where wordscome from.
We assume here that the annotatorwill do his job according to the background ofhis native region.TunDiaWN new featuresSince the Tunisian dialect is not a standard lan-guage, new features are required to be added tothe TunDiaWN resource in order to preserve theTD specificities.
We describe below the mostimportant TD characteristics integrated in theproposed resource:SMS languageIn the context of Tunisian dialect, the SMS lan-guage is a written form which combines Latinscript and some numbers in order to express dia-lectal words.The SMS language is widely used especially insocial networks and blogs.Table 5 gives examples of the most used num-bers which aim to replace specific Arabic letters.TD words are illustrated with Latin Script (Lat-in), Arabic Letters (Ar-L) and using translitera-tion6.6 Throughout this paper we use the Buckwalter translitera-tion : http://www.qamus.org/transliteration.htmni(3)(2)109Foreign wordsThe use of foreign words is a prominent featurein the Tunisian community due to historical rea-sons.
Foreign words are used in almost everydayconversation.The following table (table 6) illustrates the use offoreign words next to Tunisian dialect ones in thesame sentence.Tunisiandialect(Latin)En tout cas, n7eb n9ollek merci3alli 3maltou m3aya.

Examples of French words widely usedin TD communicationsA TD corpus study found that pure Frenchorigin words are ubiquitous and represent11.81% of the dialogue corpus (Graja et al,2010).Tunisian dialect can also borrow and adaptwords from other languages in order to makethem sound and behave like TD words.As an illustration, the TD word ?
??????????
?/ tonarofi-yzo?
is derived from the French word ?ner-vosit??
and is synonym to the English word ?an-ger?.As can be seen, the foreign words are part of theTunisian dialect vocabulary.
Such words mustnot be neglected.
They must be added to any dic-tionary of Tunisian dialect lexicon (Graja et al.2010).The foreign words used with their original formsare added to the TunDiaWN database.Concerning the TD words having foreign origins,they are firstly distinguished from other TDwords.
The second step consists in finding theorigin words in other languages, saving them andlinking them to the concerned TD words.
Conse-quently, the borrowed TD words are easily iden-tified.
Their basic language and words arestraightforwardly found and browsed.MorphologySince the Tunisian dialect has no standard or-thography, one word can be written in manyforms using Arabic letters or Latin script.
Forexample, the word "will" can be expressed indifferent ways: ?bech?/ ?
?????
?, ?bich?
/?
?????,?mich?/?
????
?.To deal with this situation, our database structureis enriched by a new entity named ?morphology?which allows storing all versions of a given TDword.Sub-dialect groupThere are many varieties of Tunisian dialect tak-ing into account the lexical variation dependingon Tunisian regions.
We can distinguish mainlythree sub-dialects in the dialect of each region:the townspeople, peasants/farmers, Be-Douin.This is mainly due to the difference in cultureswhich adds several different words from differ-ent backgrounds having the same meaning.
(Gra-ja et al, 2010).
The feature ?sub-dialect?
as wellas the ?Region?
of the annotator are used to givefurther information about the origin of the targetword.The TD words: ?$aAf/ ?????
?, ?roEaY/?????
?,?$obaH/ ??????
?, ?gozar/   ??????
?, are used in differentTunisian regions and are synonyms< to the Eng-lish word ?to look?.TunDiaWN enrichment taskOne of our strategic goals is to provide a parallelresource which deal with the lack of parallel TD-SA dictionaries and corpus.
Therefore, we pro-ceed by gathering Tunisian dialect and StandardArabic in one unique structure and maintain thelink with the Standard English too.The starting point of the TunDiaWN enrichmentstep is the groups of TD words, resulted of per-Numbers Arabicreplaced lettersDialectal words Part ofspeechArabictranslationEnglishtranslation Latin ScripArabiclettersTransliteration3  3 ???????

TD words written using the SMS language110forming our clustering based method.
The TDroots presumed to be the center of groups areobtained by translating the SA roots available inAWN.For each TD root, the SA words related to theequivalent SA root are extracted.
Two lists ofwords derived from equivalent roots are availa-ble:  one is related to a SA root, and the other isfrom a TD one.
The concerned SA synsets arealso available.After that, the TD experts analyze and confrontthe lists in order to find new synsets enrichmentopportunities.
The TD words qualified to be re-tained are those maximizing the synset harmony.The TD experts must also fill in the necessaryattributes related to the added words and manual-ly make the necessary changes and enrichments.In fact, the added words have to be describedaccording to the new features added to the Tun-DiaWN database, so as to bring differentknowledge of different vocabularies and give alluseful details related to the target word.Linguistic study of the enriched Tun-DiaWNThe linguistic study of the enrichment possibili-ties validated by the TD experts shows manyimportant lexical trends in the TD lexicon com-paring to the SA vocabulary.A great part of Arabic synsets is enriched bywords that conserve the same SA roots and deri-vation patterns but appear with small changes invowels (cf.

Thanks to the novel added TDattributes, the TunDiaWN design provides, also,great opportunities to deal with the lack of astandard written form and other specificities ofthe Tunisian dialect.The construction process begins with the Mul-tiTD corpus construction from many sources.After preprocessing the collected texts, the TDextracted words are gathered according to theircommon TD roots.Arabic  ?????????????????
