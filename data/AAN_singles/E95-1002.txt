The syntax-semantics inter-face directly implements yntactic conditions onquantifier scoping and distributivity.
1 The con-struction of semantic representations is guided" bygeneral principles governing the interaction bet-ween syntax and semantics.
Each of these princip-les acts as a constraint o narrow down the setof possible interpretations of a sentence.
Meaningsof ambiguous entences are represented by singlepartial representations ( o-called U(nderspecified)D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to whichfurther constraints can be added monotonically togain more information about the content of a sent-ence.
There is no need to build up a large numberof alternative representations of the sentence whichare then filtered by subsequent discourse and worldknowledge.
The advantage of UDRSs is not only thatthey allow for monotonic incremental interpretationbut also that they are equipped with truth condi-tions and a proof theory that allows for inferencesto be drawn directly on structures where quantifierscope is not resolved.1 IntroductionThe semantic analysis of standard HPSG deviatesfrom the familiar Montegovian way to construct se-mantic representations mainly in that it uses unifica-tion to eliminate the need for 13-reduction.
Variables1In the present paper we do only focus on simpleprinciples restricting scope ambiguities and ambiguitiesresulting from plural NPs in English.
For German re-strictions on scope are much more complicated becausethey cannot be stated independently of scrambling phe-nomena.
In (l~-ank/Reyle 1994) the present approach isworked out for a fragment of German that deals with(i) quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by scramblingand/or movement and (ii) ambiguities that arise fromthe collective/distributive distinction of plural NPs.
Theunderlying scope theory for German was developed in(Frey 1993).
The analysis in (Frank/Reyle 1994) departssignificantly from our earlier account in (Frank/Reyle1992), where monotonicity was not ensured.9are bound to argument positions by the close inter-play between syntactic and semantic processing; andthe semantics of constituents i determined by theSemantics Principle, which governs the way of unify-ing the semantics of daughter constituents to buildup the semantic value of the phrasal constituent:The CONTENT value is projected from the seman-tic head, which is defined as the syntactic HEAD-DTR in head-comp-structures, but as the ADJ-DTRin head-adjunct structures.
It is important o notethat the semantic ontribution of quantified verb ar-guments is not completely projected as part of theCONTENT value.
The meaning of such NPs splitsinto the features QUANTS, a list representing theinformation about quantifier scope, and NUCLEUS,containing the nonquantificational core.
In the ge-neral case only the NUCLEUS is projected from thesemantic head according to the Semantics Principle,while the QUANTS value gets instantiated stepwiscin interaction with the quantifier storage mechanism(Cooper Store).
The mechanism of Cooper storageis built into HPSG by use of two further attributes,QSTORE and RETRIEVED, both represented assetsof quantifiers.
All quantifiers tart out in QSTOREby lexical definition.
The Semantics Principle definesthe inheritance of QSTORE to the phrasal constitu-ents, where they may be taken out of store by anappropriately instantiated RETRIEVED value andthen put into the QUANTS value of the CONTENTfeature.
The order in which the semantic value ofquantified NPs is retrieved fixes their relative scope.To analyse sentences with scope ambiguities everalparses are thus necessary.
Besides the definition ofappropriate restrictions to and configurations for ap-plications of RETRIEVED the main problem we facewith this kind of analysis is to modify the semanticsof HPSG in such a way that it yields underspecificdrepresentations and not sets of fully specified ones.Further shortcomings ofHPSG semantics are the fol-lowing.
First, adjuncts (like quantificationai dverbs,modals) and also negation bear the potential to in-troduce scope ambiguities.
In order to treat themby the same mechanism that treats the argumentsof the verb their meaning representation would ha-ve to be put into store.
This, however, requires fur-ther modifications of the Semantics Principle, bec-ause the treatment of head-adjunct s ructures differsessentially from the treatment of other configurati-ons (see (Pollard/Sag 1994), Ch.8).
2 Second, the-re is no underspecified representation f ambiguitiesthat arise from the distributive/collective distinctionof plural NPs (neither within the'HPSG frameworknor in the C(ore)L(anguage)E(ngine)3).
Third, thesemantic representation of indefinite NPs must beindependent of the context in which they are in-terpreted.
We do not want to switch from a uni-versally quantified interpretation to an existentiallyquantified one, when we come to disambiguate theambiguous entence Every  s tudent  who admiresa ph i losopher  eads  his or ig inal  wr i t ings  suchthat a ph i losopher  is interpreted specifically.
Thisrequirement calls for DRT as underlying semanticformalism.In the sequel of this paper we show how the extensi-on of DRT to UDRT developed in (Reyle 1993) canbe combined with an HPSG-style grammar.
The ba-sic idea of the combination being that syntax as wellas semantics provide structures of equal right; thatthe principles internal to the syntactic and seman-tic level are motivated only by the syntactic and se-mantic theory, respectively; and that mutually cons-training relations between syntax and semantics aregoverned by a separate set of principles that rela-te syntactic and semantic information appropriately.We will replace the Semantics Principle of standardHPSG versions by a principle which directly reflectsthe monotonicity underlying the interpretation pro-cess designed in (Reyle 1993): At any stage of thederivation more details are added to the descriptionof the semantic relations between the various com-ponents of the sentence, i.e.
the partial representa-tion of any mother node is the union of the parti-al representations of its daughter nodes plus furtherconstraints derived from the syntactic, semantic andalso pragmatic ontext.2 Quantifier Scope and Partial OrdersThe need for underspecified representations is bynow widely accepted within computational nd theo-retical linguistics.
4 To make the results of theongoing research on underspecified representationsavailable for HPSG we may pursue two strategies.According to the first strategy we take the HPSG-style analysis - essentially as it is - and only ap-2For general criticism of the analysis of adjuncts instandard HPSG see (Abb/Maienborn 1994).
Their ana-lysis of adjuncts in HPSG fits neatly into the account ofsemantics projection to be presented below.3See (Alshawi 1992).
In CLE the:resolution of QLFsalso involves disambiguation with respect o this kind ofambiguities.4See (Peters/vanDeemter 1995) for recent discussion.ply slight modifications to produce underspecifiedoutput.
The second strategy involves a more radicalchange as it takes an existing theory of underspeci-fled representations and replaces the HPSG seman-tics by the construction principles of this theory.Let us start out with a sketch of the first approach.It will show us where its limitations are and allowus to compare different approaches to underspeci-fication.
The first thing to do, when un-specifyingHPSG semantics, is to relax the retrieval operati-on.
This must be done in two respects.
First, wemust allow NP-meanings not to be retrieved at all.This results in their relative scope not being deter-mined.
Second, we must accommodate syntactic andsemantic restrictions on possible scope relations tobe stated by the grammar.
5 Restrictions pecifying,for example, that the subject NP must always havewide scope over the other arguments of the verb; or,that the scope of genuinely quantified NPs is clausebounded.
The modifications we propose are the fol-lowing.
First, we incorporate the QSTORE featureinto the CONTENT feature structure.
This makesthe NP meanings available even if they are not re-trieved from QSTORE.
Second, we take the value ofthe QUANTS feature not to be a "stack" (i.e.
by ap-pending new retrieved quantifiers as first elementsto QUANTS), but allow any NP meaning that is re-trieved at a later stage to be inserted at any placein that list.
This means that the order of NP mea-nings in QUANTS fixes the relative scope of thesemeanings only; it does not imply that they havenarrow scope with respect o the NP meaning thatwill be retrieved next.
But this is not yet enoughto implement clause boundedness.
The easiest wayto formulate this restriction is to prohibit projectionof quantified NP meanings across bounding nodes.Thus the QSTORE and QUANTS values of a boun-ding node inherit the quantificational informationonly of indefinite NPs and not of generalized quan-tifiers.
To be more precise, let us consider the tree/3 consisting only of the bounding nodes in the syn-tactic analysis of a sentence 3".
Then the semanticcontent of ~ can be associated with nodes of ~ inthe following way.
For each node i of fl the attribu-tes QUANTS, QSTORE and NUCLEUS have valuesquantsi, qstorei and nucleusi.
The relative scopebetween scope bearing phrases of ~, i.e.
between theelements of Ui(quantsiUqstorei) can then be definedas follows.?
If Q1 and Q2 are in quantsi and Q1 precedesQ2, then Q1 has scope over Q2.?
If Qa is in quantsi and Q2 in quantsj, where idominates j, then Q1 has scope over Q2.?
If Q1 is in qstorei and not in qstorej, whe-re i dominates j ,  then Qa has scope overany Q2 in qstorejUquantsj that are not inqstoreiUquantsi.5This has to be done also for the standard theory.10Tim last clause says that any NP Q1 occurring inthe clause of level i and that is still in QSTOREhas scope over all quantified NPs Q2 occurring inembedded clauses (i.e.
clauses of level j) .
But Q1does not necessarily have scope over any indefiniteNP introduced at level j .Those familiar with the work of Alshawi and Crouch(Alshawi/Crouch 1992) might have noticed the simi-larity of their interpretation mechanism and whatwe have achieved by our modifications to standardHPSG semantics.
The elements of QUANTS play ex-actly the same role as the instantiated metavariablesof Alshawi and Crouch.
This means that we couldadapt their interpretation mechahism to our parti-ally scoped CONTENT structures.
But note that wealready have achieved more than they have as we areable to express the clause-boundeness re triction forgeneralized quantifiers.We will not go into the details and show how thetruth conditions of Alshawi and Crouch have to bemodified in order to apply to partially scoped CON-TENT structures.
We will instead go ahead and workout the limitations of what we called the first stra-tegy.
To keep things as easy as possible we restrictourselves to the case of simple sentences (i.e.
to.
tri-vial tree structures of QSTORE and QUANTS va-lues that consist of one single node only).
In thiscase the QUANTS value (as well as the instantiati-on of metavariables) imposes a partial order on therelative scope of quantifiers.
Assume we had a sent-ence with three quantifiers, Q1, Q2 and Q3.
Thenthe possible lenghts of QUANTS values varies from0 to 3.
Lengths 0 and 1 leave the relative scope ofQ1, Q2 and Q3 completely underspecified.
Values oflength 2 say that their first element always has wi-de scope over the second, leaving all possible choicesfor the third quantifier.
And finally we have the fullyspecified scoping relations given by values of length3.
There are, however, some possibilities to restrictscope relationships that cannot be represented thisway: One cannot, for example, represent the ambi-guity that remains if we (or, syntax and semantics)require that Q1 and Q2 must have scope over Q3,but leaves unspecified the relative scope between Q1and Q2; nor are we able to express a restriction thatsays Q1 must have scope over both, Q2 and Q3, whileleaving the relative scope between Q2 and Q3 un-specified.
Retrieving a quantifier Qi (or starting tocalculate the truth value of a sentence by first consi-dering this quantifier) is an operation that takes Qiand adds it to QUANTS.
As QUANTS is a list thisamounts to a full specification of the relative scopeof Qi with respect o all other elements already con-tained in QUANTS.
This shows that the expressivepower of the representation language is too restricti-ve already for simple sentences.
We need to representpartial orders of quantifier scope.
But we cannot dothis by talking about a pair consisting of a quanti-fier Qi and a list of quantifiers QUANTS.
We mustbe able to talk about pairs o\] quantifiers.
This notonly increases the expressive power of the represen-tation language, it also allows for the formulation ofrestrictions on quantifier scope in a declarative andnatural way.
The formalism of UDRSs we introducein the following section is particularly suited to 'talk'about semantic information contributed by diffcrentcomponents of a sentence.
It therefore provides aparticularly good ground to implement a principlebased construction of semantic representations.3 UDRS Construct ion in HPSGIn the following we will design a syntax-semantics n-terface for the construction of UDRSes in HPSG, fo-cussing on the underspecified representation f scopeand plural.
To overcome the problems discussed inSection 2 we chose to depart from the semanticsused in standard HPSG (Pollard/Sag 1994), and in-stead allow for the construction of (U)DRScs.
Thestructure of the CONTENT attribute as well as theSemantics Principle will be changed substantially,since the construction of (U)DRSes allows for inher-ently different information structures and processingmechanisms.
The former CONTENT attribute is re-placed by a complex feature structure UDRS, consi-sting of three attributes, LS, SUBORD and CONDS.I F~s \[L-MAX I,..~\] \](1) / uDRs/susoar) {l < 1'....}|L g ?

JCONDS is a set of labelled DRS-conditions, ~i, theform of which is determined by lexical entries.
SUB-ORD contains information about the hierarchicalstructure of a DRS.
It is expressed by means of asubordination relation, <, between labels.
If ")'1 and"72 are two DRS-conditions with labels ll and 12 suchthat ll <_ 12 is contained in SUBORD, then this isequivalent o saying that ~/1 and ")'2 will occur inDRSs/(1 and/(2  such that / (1  is weakly subordina-te to / (2 ,  i.e.
/(1 is either identical to I(2 or nestedwithin it.
SUBORD thus imposes the structure of anupper semi-lattice with one-element, lT, to the setof labels.
The attribute LS defines the distinguishedlabels, which indicate the upper and lower boundsfor a DRS-condition within the semilattice.The main task in constructing UDRSes consistsin appropriately relating the labels of the DRS-conditions that are to be combined.
This is perfor-med by the association of DRS-conditions with di-stinguished labels in the lexical entries on the onehand and by conditions governing the projection ofthe distinguished labels on the other.
The role of thedistinguished labels is most transparent with verbsand quantifiers.In the lexical entry of a transitive verb, for example,the DRS-condition stated in CONDS is a relation11holding between discourse referents.
6 This conditionis associated with an identifying label 1.

The quantificational re-lation holding between them is stated in terms ofthe relation attribute, REL.
In the lexical entry forevery, given in (3), a new discourse referent is intro-duced, in the restrictor DRS, labelled 111, which isidentified with the label of the subcategorized NP.The feature SUBORD defines the labels of restrictorand scope to be subordinate to the label 11 whichidentifies the entire condition.
The label 11 is defi-ned as the upper bound, or distinguished maximallabel of the quantificational structure, whereas thelower bound, or distinguished minimal label is givenby the label of the nuclear scope, 112.?

Contrary to the Semantics Principle of(Pollard/Sag 1994) the semantic onditions are al-ways inherited from both daughters (we assume bi-?The reference to discourse referents of the syntacticarguments i  only provisionally stated here.
For the pre-cise definition see (10) below.
The use of SUBCAT (SC)as a head attribute is motivated in (Frank 1994).nary branching) and therefore project to the upper-most sentential level.
Furthermore, clause (I) app-lies to head-comp- and head-adj-structures in exactlythe same way.
7 Clause (II) of the Semantics Princi-ple defines the inheritance of subordination restric-tions: The subordination restrictions of the phraseare defined by the union of the SUBORD values ofthe daughters.
Clause (Ill) of the Semantics Princi-ple states the distinguished labels LS of the phrase tobe identical to the distinguished labels of the HEAD-daughter.
It is therefore guaranteed that in binarybranching structures the minimal and maximal la-bels of the head category are available all along the(extended) head projection, s This prepares clauses(IV) and (V) of the Semantics Principle, which de-fine the binding of discourse markers and localityof quantificational scope, respectively.
We will firstconsider clause (IV) and will come back to clause(V) in the next Section.In a (U)DRS, the partial structure of the verb hasto be (weakly) subordinate to the scope of all thepartial DRSes that introduce the discourse markerscorresponding to the verb's arguments.
This gua-rantees that all occurrences of discourse markers areproperly bound by some superordinated DRS.
Theconstraint is realized by clause (IV) of the SemanticsPrinciple, the Closed Formula Principle.
It guaran-tees that the label associated with the verb, which isidentified with the distinguished minimal abel of thesentential projection, is subordinated to the minimallabel, or lower bound of each of the verb's arguments.Note that with quantified arguments the predicateof the verb must be subordinate to the nuclear scopeof the quantifier.
As defined in (3), it is in fact thenuclear scope of the quantified structure that willbe accessed by the distinguished minimal label ofthe quantified NP.
Thus the Closed Formula Princi-ple (IV) in (5) states that in every (non-functional)head-comp-struc a further subordination restrictionis unioned to the phrase's SUBORD value, whichsubordinates the minimal abel of the head -here theminimal abel associated with the verb- to the mini-mal label of its actual complement, which in case ofa quantified argument identifies the nuclear scope.Semantics Pr inc ip le :  9" rLS \[\] \]1..UDRS \[SUBORD., U { ~ > ~ }  U\[~\] U\[~\] JJ LCONDS \[\] uI-fl .head-comp-st.rucH-DTR.

As plural NPs introduce a quan-tificational condition when they are interpreted is-tributively but behave like indefinites when interpre-ted collectively, in a representation f their meaningthat is underspecified with respect o the distribu-tive/collective ambiguity plural NPs must be mar-ked as potentially scope bearing.
This can be achie-ved if in the lexicon entry of a plural determiner(6) we do not completely specify the relation bet-ween the minimal label 112 and the maximal abell~, but only require that 112 is weakly subordinate to11.
This weak subordination relation will be furtherrestricted to either identity or strict subordinationwhen more information is available from the seman-tic or pragmatic ontext hat allows the ambiguity tobe resolved.
By monotonically adding further cons-traints a collective or quantificational (distributiveor generic) reading of the plural NP may then bespecified, xl If a distributive reading is chosen, theminimal label 112 will identify the nuclear scope ofthe quantified structure, and in the case of a coll-ective reading the relation of (weak) subordinationbetween minimal and maximal abel will be reducedto identity.

Furthersubordination restrictions will be added - monoto-nically - by the remaining clauses of the SemanticsPrinciple, to be introduced in the next Section.4 Quantifier Scope and PluralDisambiguationQuant i f i cat iona l  Scope Since the conditions onquantificational scope for generalized quantifiers anddistributive readings of plural NPs are dependent onsyntactic structure, the Semantics Principle will besupplemented by further clauses governing the in-terface between syntactic onstraints and semanticrepresentation.
Note that genuine quantifiers as wellas distributive readings of plural NPs differ in theirscope potential from indefinite NPs and collectivclyinterpreted plural NPs.
Whereas the latter may takearbitrarily wide scope, the scope of the former isclause bounded, i.e.
they are allowed to take scopeonly over elements that appear in their local domain.We implement this restriction by requiring that themaximal abel of a generalized quantifier be subor-dinate to the distinguished label that identifies theupper bound of the local domain.
For plural NPs, asimilar constraint must be stated in case a distribu-tive reading is chosen which specifies the plural NPas scope bearing.The distinction between scope bearing and not scopebearing NPs was defined by strict subordination andidentity of the distinguished labels, respectively.
Incase a distributive reading is chosen by the clausesfor plural disambiguation, to be stated below, the re-lation of weak subordination i (6), is strengthenedto strict subordination.
Yet, plural disambiguationmay take place rather late in subsequent discourse,while the syntactic constraints for quantificationalscope can only be determined locally.
The Quanti-tier Scope Principle (V) will therefore introduce con-ditionalized subordination restrictions to define theclause-boundedness of both generalized quantifiersand distributively quantified plural NPs.
~2For finite sentences the local domain for quantifiedverb arguments comes down to the local IP projec-tion (Frey 1993).
In a functional HPSG grammar(see (Frank 1994)) this local domain corresponds tothe functional projection of the finite VP.
The di-stinguished maximal abel lmax which identifies theupper bound of the local domain for quantified vcrbarguments will therefore be instantiated by the com-plementizer heading a finite sentence, as in (7).X2The scoping principles described in (Frank/lleyle1994) further account for the scope restrictions of ge-neralized quantifiers and distributive plural NPs.13Due to the projection of the distinguished labels byclause (III) of the Semantics Principle and the de-finition of functional categories, the upper boundfor the local domain of quantifier scope, lma~, isavailable throughout the extended projection, whereclause (V) of the Semantics Principle, the Quanti-fier Scope Principle, applies.
In (8), the QuantifierScope Principle (V) states that if the complement isa generalized quantifier (type quant) or a potentiallyscope bearing plural NP (type plura 0 the SUBORDvalue of the phrase will contain a further conditiona-lized subordination constraint, which states that - ifthe argument is, or will be characterized as a scopebearing argument by strict subordination of its mini-mal and maximal abel - the complement's maximallabel lq~,a,u is subordinate to the label lmax whichidentifies the upper bound of the local domain.Semant ics  Pr inc ip le :Clauses I - IV &: V Quantifier Scope Principle -o \]\].D~S / s~B?~D q~> ~ ~ ~ -> \ [ ~.head-cornp--strue(S) e - ~ r ~CAT J HEAD quant V plural "\]LS .

Thus, if contextdoes not provide us with further, disambiguating in-formation, (11) will be the final, underspecified re-presentation for (9).

Instead,the function dre/_res will be implemented by usingdelaying techniques.
The conditions which determi-ne the delayed evaluation of the function dre/_res aredefined in its second argument Cond.
As long as thevariable Cond is not instantiated, the evaluation of~dref_res will be blocked, i.e.

The second clause applies if the semanticstructure of the argument contains a subordinationrestriction which characterizes the NP as scope bea-ring.

It returns the discourse referentwhich in the argument's UDRS is associated with themaximal abel for not scope bearing NPs, and withthe label of the restrictor 111 for scope bearing NPs.For plural NPs, which are represented as potential-ly scope bearing by a weak subordination constraintas shown in (6), the clauses in (12) will fail: the re-quired subordination conditions will not be contai-ned in the SUBORD value of the verb argument.

This is what we aimed at for the special con-cerns of plural underspecification.If, however, a particular eading of a plural NP isdetermined by the lexical meaning of the verb, as itis the case for gather, an appropriate definition ofdref_res in the lexical entry of the verb ensures thecorrect plural interpretation.P lu ra l  D isamblguat ion  In most cases, however,disambiguating information for the interpretation ofplurals comes from various sources of semantic orpragmatic knowledge.

We therefore define a mechanismfor plural disambiguation which may apply at anystage of the derivation, to add disambiguating DRSconditions and subordination constraints to the un-derspecified representation whenever enough infor-mation is available to determine a particular pluralinterpretation.
To this end we extend the Semantics14This will be so even if - by the function pl_dis to beintroduced below - further disambiguating constraintsfor, e.g., a collective or distributive reading are introdu-ced at a later stage of the derivation: dref_res i definedon the UDRS value of a verb argument in the lexicalentry of the verb.

Ideally, these constraintshave access to inference modules, including semanticand pragmatic knowledge.
We first state the functionpidis for the different readings and then incorporatethe function into the Semantics Principle.If in clause (14) of pLdis the constraints that deter-mine a collective reading of the plural NP with label11 are satisfied, the relation of weak subordinationbetween the minimal and maximal abel of the plu-ral NP is strenghtened to the identity relation.
In tileoutput value the restriction 11 = In gets unioned tothe original SUBORD value.
Note that the functionpidis is fully monotonic in that its result is a UDRSwhich is obtained by only adding information to theinput values SUBORD and CONDS by union.Whenever disambiguation of a plural NP takesplace, the function dref_res must be relieved from itsdelayed status in order to instantiate the correspon-ding argument slot of the verb.
We will access thedelayed goal dref_res by reference to the plural NP'smaximal and minimal labels 11 and 112, instantiateits second argument by the identity constraint 11 =112, and define its value by the DREF value X asso-ciated with 11.
The resulting UDRS for a collectiveinterpretation of (9) is given in (15).rSUBORD \[\] { ",El\] > \[Vj1...}pt-dls CONDS LABEL :=L \[\] \[Lsra ~\](14) / s~o~ \[\] o (~ \[rm = rrrrl\]LCONDS \[\]Conditions:constraints for a collective reading (of X) &:L L-MIN I I .L~IJ JSUBORD { |T  > IT > > -- r _Era.

The restrictorIn introduces an individual discourse referent x to-gether with the distribution condition x 6 X andthe nuclear scope is identified by the minimal label112.
Moreover, (strong) subordination of restrictorand scope is defined in SUBORD.
Again, the delayedfunction dref_res is defined to return the discoursereferent x which is to fill the argument slot of the15verb and is un-delayed by instantiation of its secondargument.LS \[\](\[SUBORD\[~\] {..\[h'\]>\[~ ..} \ ]~pl-dls LA - ~'="' := t L oNo \[\] {... ...}j)}}\[s..,.o.-<o im > Elm >(16) I ( FLAB~-L\[~ I FLABI~L il\[~klJ -\]Condit ions:constra ints  for a d is t r ibut ive reading (of X) ~<,.,:,.o<,_:o:,: <,,..,_..:(\Ve now complete the Semantics Principle by thePrinciple for Plural Disambiguation (VI).
In (17),the function pl_dis applies in a coordination struc-ture coord-struc, which recursively, combines pairs of(sequences of) sentences and a sentence.
The func-tion pl_dis applies to the phrase's UDRS value, whichis defined by application of the basic clauses (I) and(II) of UDRS construction.
Depending on the con-text represented in UDRS, and supplemented by ge-neral semantic and/or pragmatic knowledge, pl_dismonotonically redefines the phrase's UDRS value ifdisambiguating constraints for a specific plural rea-ding can be determined.
If the constraints for plu-ral disambiguation (14) and (16) are not satisfied,the trivial clause of pl_dis applies, which returns theUDRS value of its argument without modifications.Semant ics  Pr inc ip le :  Clauses I, II and VI \[:.

The new formalism comes closer to a princi-ple based construction of semantic structure and,therefore, is more in the spirit of HPSG philosophythan its standard approach.
Furthermore the newformalism overcomes a number of shortcomings ofthe standard approach in a natural way.In particular, we presented an HPSG grammar forEnglish that defines a syntax-semantics interfacefor the construction of U(nderspecified) D(iscourse)R(epresentation) S(tructure)s. The construction isguided by general principles, which clearly identifythe interaction between the modules, i.e.
the "inter-face" between syntax and semantics.
In the fragmentwe defined underspecificied representations forquan-tificational structures and plural NPs.
The princip-les governing the interaction of syntax and semanticsspecify scoping relations for quantifiers and quanti-ficational readings of plural NPs.In addition to the syntax/semantics nterface the Se-mantics Principle developed in this paper defines aclear interface to contextual and pragmatic knowled-ge.
This interface allows reasoning modules to inter-act with semantics construction.
The approach takenhere can, therefore, be generalized to disambiguationproblems other than the collective/distributive am-biguity as well as to anaphora resolution.
