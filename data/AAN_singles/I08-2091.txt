Generally, a term in a bi-lingual dictionary is provided with verylimited information such as part-of-speech,a set of synonyms, and a set of Englishequivalents.
This type of dictionary iscomparatively reliable and can be found inan electronic form from various publishers.In this paper, we propose an algorithm forapplying a set of criteria to assign a synsetwith an appropriate degree of confidence tothe existing bi-lingual dictionary.
We showthe efficiency in nominating the synsetcandidate by using the most common lexi-cal information.
The algorithm is evaluatedagainst the implementation of Thai-English, Indonesian-English, and Mongo-lian-English bi-lingual dictionaries.
Theexperiment also shows the effectiveness ofusing the same type of dictionary from dif-ferent sources.1 IntroductionThe Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998)is one of the most semantically rich English lexicaldatabases that are widely used as a lexical knowl-edge resource in many research and developmenttopics.
The database is divided by part of speechinto noun, verb, adjective and adverb, organized insets of synonyms, called synset, each of whichrepresents ?meaning?
of the word entry.Though WordNet was already used as a startingresource for developing many language WordNets,the construction of the WordNet for any languagescan be varied according to the availability of thelanguage resources.
Some were developed fromscratch, and some were developed from the combi-nation of various existing lexical resources.
Span-ish and Catalan WordNets, for instance, are auto-matically constructed using hyponym relation,monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary andtaxonomy (Atserias et al, 1997).
Italian WordNet(Magnini et al, 1994) is semi-automatically con-structed from definition in monolingual dictionary,bilingual dictionary, and WordNet glosses.
Hun-garian WordNet uses bilingual dictionary, mono-lingual explanatory dictionary, and Hungarian the-saurus in the construction (Proszeky et al, 2002),etc.673This paper presents a new method particularly tofacilitate the WordNet construction by using theexisting resources having only English equivalentsand the lexical synonyms.
Our proposed criteriaand algorithm for application are evaluated by im-plementing to Asian languages which occupy quitedifferent language phenomena in terms of gram-mars and word unit.To evaluate our criteria and algorithm, we usethe PWN version 2.1 containing 207,010 sensesclassified into adjective, adverb, verb, and noun.The basic building block is a ?synset?
which isessentially a context-sensitive grouping of syno-nyms which are linked by various types of relationsuch as hyponym, hypernymy, meronymy, anto-nym, attributes, and modification.
Our approach isconducted to assign a synset to a lexical entry byconsidering its English equivalent and lexicalsynonyms.
The degree of reliability of the assign-ment is defined in terms of confidence score (CS)based on our assumption of the membership of theEnglish equivalent in the synset.
A dictionary fromdifferent source is also a reliable source to increasethe accuracy of the assignment because it can ful-fill the thoroughness of the list of English equiva-lent and the lexical synonyms.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 describes our criteria for synset assign-ment.
Section 3 provides the results of the experi-ments and error analysis on Thai, Indonesian, andMongolian.
Section 4 evaluates the accuracy of theassignment result, and the effectiveness of thecomplimentary use of a dictionary from differentsources.
Section 5 shows a collaborative interfacefor revising the result of synset assignment.
AndSection 6 concludes our work.2 Synset AssignmentA set of synonyms determines the meaning of aconcept.
Under the situation of limited resourceson a language, English equivalent word in a bi-lingual dictionary is a crucial key to find anappropriate synset for the entry word in question.The synset assignment criteria described in thisSection relies on the information of Englishequivalent and synonym of a lexical entry, whichis most commonly encoded in a bi-lingualdictionary.Synset Assignment CriteriaApplying the nature of WordNet which introducesa set of synonyms to define the concept, we set upfour criteria for assigning a synset to a lexical entry.The confidence score (CS) is introduced toannotate the likelihood of the assignment.
Thehighest score, CS=4, is assigned to the synset thatis evident to include more than one Englishequivalent of the lexical entry in question.
On thecontrary, the lowest score, CS=1, is assigned toany synset that occupies only one of the Englishequivalents of the lexical entry in question whenmultiple English equivalents exist.The details of assignment criteria are elaboratedas in the followings.
Li denotes the lexical entry, Ejdenotes the English equivalent, Sk denotes the syn-set, and ?
denotes the member of a set:Case 1: Accept the synset that includes morethan one English equivalent with confidence scoreof 4.Figure 1 simulates that a lexical entry L0 has twoEnglish equivalents of E0 and E1.
Both E0 and E1are included in a synset of S1.
The criterion impliesthat both E0 and E1 are the synset for L0 which canbe defined by a greater set of synonyms in S1.Therefore the relatively high confidence score,CS=4, is assigned for this synset to the lexical en-try.Figure 1.
Synset assignment with SC=4Example:L0: E0: aim  E1: targetS0: purpose, intent, intention, aim, designS1: aim, object, objective, targetS2: aimIn the above example, the synset, S1, is assignedto the lexical entry, L0, with CS=4.Case 2: Accept the synset that includes morethan one English equivalent of the synonym of thelexical entry in question with confidence score of 3.In case that Case 1 fails in finding a synset thatincludes more than one English equivalent, theEnglish equivalent of a synonym of the lexical en-try is picked up to investigate.L0E0S0 ?S1?E1?S2?674Figure 2.
Synset assignment with SC=3Figure 2 simulates that an English equivalent ofa lexical entry L0 and its synonym L1 are includedin a synset S1.
In this case the synset S1 is assignedto both L0 and L1 with CS=3.
The score in this caseis lower than the one assigned in Case 1 becausethe synonym of the English equivalent of the lexi-cal entry is indirectly implied from the Englishequivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry.
Thenewly retrieved English equivalent may not be dis-torted.Example:L0: L1: E0: stare  E1: gazeS0: gaze, stare S1: stareIn the above example, the synset, S0, is assignedto the lexical entry, L0, with CS=3.Case 3: Accept the only synset that includes theonly one English equivalent with confidence scoreof 2.Figure 3.
Synset assignment with SC=2Figure 3 simulates the assignment of CS-2 whenthere is only one English equivalent and there is nosynonym of the lexical entry.
Though there is noany English equivalent to increase the reliability ofthe assignment, in the same time there is nosynonym of the lexical entry to distort the relation.In this case, the only one English equivalent showsit uniqueness in the translation that can maintain adegree of the confidence.Example:L0:           E0: obstetricianS0: obstetrician, accoucheurIn the above example, the synset, S0, is assignedto the lexical entry, L0, with CS=2.Case 4: Accept more than one synset that in-cludes each of the English Equivalent with confi-dence score of 1.Case 4 is the most relax rule to provide some re-lation information between the lexical entry and asynset.
Figure 4 simulates the assignment of CS=1to any relations that do not meet the previous crite-ria but the synsets that include one of the Englishequivalent of the lexical entry.Figure 4.
Synset assignment with SC=1Example:L0: E0: hole  E1: canalS0: hole, hollowS1: hole, trap, cakehole, maw, yap, gopS2: canal, duct, epithelial duct, channelIn the above example, each synset, S0, S1, and S2is assigned to lexical entry L0, with CS=1.3 Experiment resultsWe applied the synset assignment criteria to aThai-English dictionary (MMT dictionary) (CICC,1995) with the synset from WordNet 2.1.
To com-pare the ratio of assignment for Thai-English dic-tionary, we also investigate the synset assignmentof Indonesian-English and Mongolian-English dic-tionaries.WordNet (synset) T-E Dict (entry)total assigned total assignedNoun 145,103 18,353 (13%) 43,07211,867(28%)Verb 24,884 1,333 (5%) 17,6692,298(13%)Adjective 31,302 4,034 (13%) 18,4483,722(20%)Adverb 5,721 737 (13%) 3,0081,519(51%)total 207,010 24,457 (12%) 82,19719,406(24%)Table 1.
Synset assignment to T-E dictionaryIn our experiment, there are only 24,457 synsetsfrom 207,010 synsets, which is 12% of the totalnumber of the synset that can be assigned to Thailexical entries.
Table 1 shows the successful rate inassigning synset to Thai-English dictionary.
About24 % of Thai lexical entries are found with theEnglish equivalents that meet one of our criteria.Going through the list of unmapped lexical en-try, we can classify the errors into three groups:-1.

For example,L: 		 E: retail shopL:   E: pull sharply2.
PhraseSome particular words culturally used in onelanguage may not be simply translated intoone single word sense in English.
In thiscase, we found it explained in a phrase.
Forexample,L: 	E: small pavilion for monks to sit on tochantL: E: bouquet worn over the ear3.
Word formInflected forms i.e.
plural, past participle,are used to express an appropriate sense of alexical entry.
This can be found in non-inflection languages such as Thai and mostof Asian languages.
For example,L: 	  E: grievedThe above English expressions cause an error infind an appropriate synset.WordNet (synset) I-E Dict (entry)total assigned total assignedNoun 145,103 4,955 (3%) 20,8392,710(13%)Verb 24,884 7,841 (32%) 15,2144,243(28%)Adjective 31,302 3,722 (12%) 4,8372,463(51%)Adverb 5,721 381 (7%) 414285(69%)total 207,010 16,899 (8%) 41,3049,701(24%)Table 2.
Synset assignment to I-E dictionaryWe applied the same algorithm to Indonesia-English and Mongolian-English (Hangin, 1986)dictionaries to investigate how it works with otherlanguages in terms of the selection of Englishequivalents.
The difference in unit of concept isbasically understood to effect the assignment ofEnglish equivalents in bi-lingual dictionaries.
InTable 2, the size of Indonesian-English dictionaryis about half of Thai-English dictionary.
The suc-cess rates of assignment to the lexical entry are thesame but the rate of synset assignment of Indone-sian-English dictionary is lower than one of Thai-English dictionary.
This is because the total num-ber of lexical entry is almost in the half size.WordNet (synset) ME Dict (entry)total assigned Total assignedNoun 145,103 268 (0.18%) 168125(74.40%)Verb 24,884 240 (0.96%) 193139(72.02%)Adjective 31,302 211 (0.67%) 232129(55.60%)Adverb 5,721 35 (0.61%) 4217(40.48%)total 207,010 754 (0.36%) 635410(64.57%)Table 3.
Synset assignment to M-E dictionaryA small set of Mongolian-English dictionary isalso evaluated.
Table 3 shows the result of synsetassignment.These experiments show the effectiveness of us-ing English equivalents and synonyms informationfrom limited resources in assigning WordNet syn-sets.4 EvaluationsIn the evaluation of our approach for synset as-signment, we randomly selected 1,044 synsetsfrom the result of synset assignment to Thai-English dictionary (MMT dictionary) for manuallychecking.
The random set covers all types of part-of-speech and degrees of confidence score (CS) toconfirm the approach in all possible situations.
Ac-cording to the supposition of our algorithm that theset of English equivalents of a word entry and itssynonyms are significant information to relate to asynset of WordNet, the result of accuracy will becorrespondent to the degree of CS.
The detail num-ber of synsets to be used in the evaluation is shownin Table 4.CS=4 CS=3 CS=2 CS=1 totalNoun 7 479 64 272 822Verb  44 75 29 148Adjective 1 25  32 58Adverb 7 4 4 1 16total 15 552 143 334 1044Table 4.
Random set of synset assignmentTable 5 shows the accuracy of synset assign-ment by part-of-speech and CS.
A small set of ad-verb synsets are 100% correctly assigned irrelevantto its CS.
The total number of adverbs for theevaluation could be too small.
The algorithmshows a better result of 48.7% in average for noun676synset assignment and 43.2% in average for allpart-of-speech.CS=4 CS=3 CS=2 CS=1 totalNoun 5 (71.4%)306(63.9%)34(53.1%)55(20.2%)400(48.7%)Verb23(52.3%)6(8.0%)4(13.8%)33(22.3%)Adjective 2 (8.0%)2(3.4%)Adverb 7 (100%)4(100%)4(100%)1(100%)16(100%)total 12 (80.0%)335(60.7%)44(30.8%)60(18%)451(43.2%)Table 5.
Accuracy of synset assignmentWith the better information of English equiva-lents marked with CS=4, the assignment accuracyis as high as 80.0% and decreases accordingly dueto the CS value.
This confirms that the accuracy ofsynset assignment strongly relies on the number ofEnglish equivalents in the synset.
The indirect in-formation of English equivalents of the synonymof the word entry is also helpful.
It yields 60.7% ofaccuracy in synset assignment for the group ofCS=3.
Others are quite low but the English equiva-lents are somehow useful to provide the candidatesfor expert revision.CS=4 CS=3 CS=2 CS=1 totalNoun 2  22 29 53Verb  2 6 4 12AdjectiveAdverbtotal 2 2 28 33 65Table 6.
Additional correct synset assignment byother dictionary (LEXiTRON)To examine the effectiveness of English equiva-lent and synonym information from differentsource, we consulted another Thai-English diction-ary (LEXiTRON).
Table 6 shows the improvementof the assignment by the increased number of cor-rect assignment in each type.
We can correct morein noun and verb but not adjective.
Verb and adjec-tive are ambiguously defined in Thai lexicon, andthe number of the remained adjective is too few,therefore, the result should be improved uncon-cerned with the type.CS=4 CS=3 CS=2 CS=1 totaltotal 14 (93.3%)337(61.1%)72(50.3%)93(27.8%)516(49.4%)Table 7.
Improved correct synset assignment byadditional bi-lingual dictionary (LEXiTRON)Table 7 shows the total improvement of the as-signment accuracy when we integrated Englishequivalent and synonym information from differ-ent source.
The accuracy for synsets marked withCS=4 is improved from 80.0% to 93.3% and theaverage accuracy is also significantly improvedfrom 43.2% to 49.4%.
All types of synset are sig-nificantly improved only if a bi-lingual dictionaryfrom different sources is available.5 Collaborative Work on Asian WordNetThere are some efforts in developing WordNets ofsome Asian languages, e.g.
Chinese, Japanese, Ko-rean (Choi, 2003), (Choi et al, 2004), (Kaji et al,2006), (KorLex, 2006), (Huang, 2007) and Hindi(Hindi Wordnet, 2007).
The number of languagesthat have been successfully developed their Word-Nets is still limited to some active research in thisarea.
However, the extensive development ofWordNet in other languages is important, not onlyto help in implementing NLP applications in eachlanguage, but also in inter-linking WordNets ofdifferent languages to develop multi-lingual appli-cations to overcome the language barrier.We adopt the proposed criteria for automaticsynset assignment for Asian languages which haslimited language resources.
Based on the resultfrom the above synset assignment algorithm, weprovide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initiator)(Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlamvanich etal., 2007) to establish an online collaborative workin refining the WorNets.KUI is a community software which allows reg-istered members including language experts reviseand vote for the synset assignment.
The systemmanages the synset assignment according to thepreferred score obtained from the revision process.As a result, the community WordNets will be ac-complished and exported into the original form ofWordNet database.
Via the synset ID assigned inthe WordNet, the system can generate a cross lan-guage WordNet result.
Through this effort, an ini-tial version of Asian WordNet can be fulfilled.Figure 5 illustrates the translation page of KUI1.In the working area, the login member can partici-pate in proposing a new translation or vote for thepreferred translation to revise the synset assign-ment.
Statistics of the progress as well as manyuseful functions such as item search, record jump,chat, list of online participants are also provided.1http://www.tcllab.org/kui677KUI is actively facilitating members in revising theAsian WordNet database.Figure 5.
Sample of KUI interface6 ConclusionOur synset assignment criteria were effectivelyapplied to languages having only English equiva-lents and its lexical synonym.
Confidence scorewas proved efficiently assigned to determine thedegree of reliability of the assignment which laterwas a key value in the revision process.
Languagesin Asia are significantly different from the Englishlanguage in terms of grammar and lexical wordunit.
The differences prevent us from finding thetarget synset by following just the English equiva-lent.
Synonyms of the lexical entry and additionaldictionary from different sources can be compli-mentarily used to improve the accuracy in the as-signment.
Applying the same criteria to otherAsian languages also yielded a satisfactory result.Following the same process that we had imple-mented to the Thai language, we are expecting anacceptable result from the Indonesian, Mongolianlanguages and so on.
After the revision at KUI, theinitial stage of Asian WordNet will be referablethrough the assigned synset ID.ReferencesBernardo Magnini, Carlo Strapparava, Fabio Ciravegnaand Emanuele Pianta, 1994.
