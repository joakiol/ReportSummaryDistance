ukAbstractWe compare the potential of two classes el' linear and hi-erarchical models of discourse to determine co-referencelinks and resolve anaphors.
The comparison uses a co lpus of thirty texts, which were manually annotated forco-reference and discourse structure.1 IntroductionMost current anaphora resolution systems implelnent apipeline architecture with three modules (Lappin and Le-ass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997).1.
A COLLF.CT module determines a list of potentialantecedents (LPA) for each anaphor (l~ronourl, deli-nile noun, proper name, etc.)
that have the potentialto resolve it.2.
A FILTI~,P, module eliminates referees incompatiblewith the anaphor fi'om the LPA.3.
A PP, EFERENCE module determines the most likelyantecedent on the basis of an ordering policy.In most cases, the COLLECT module determines an LPAby enumerating all antecedents in a window o1' text thatprecedes the anaphor under scrutiny (Hobbs, 1978; Lap-pin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997;Ge et al, 1998).
This window can be as small as twoor three sentences or as large as the entire precedingtext.
The FILTEP, module usually imposes emantic on-straints by requiring that the anaphor and potential an-tecedents have the same number and gendm; that selec-tional restrictions are obeyed, etc.
The PREFERENCEmodule imposes preferences on potential antecedentson the basis of their grammatical roles, parallelism,fi'equency, proximity, etc.
In some cases, anaphoraresolution systems implement hese modules explic-itly (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov,* On leave fi'om lhe Faculty of Computer Science, University "AI.
I.Cuza" of lasi.1997; Kameyama, 1997).
In other cases, these modulesare integrated by means of statistical (Ge et al, 1998) oruncertainty reasoning teclmiques (Mitkov, 1997).The fact that current anaphora resolution systems relyexclusively on the linear nature of texts in order to de-termine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given flintseveral studies have claimed that there is a strong rela-tion between discourse structure and reference (Sidner,1981 ; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al, 1995; Fox,1987; Vonk ct al., 1992; Azzam el al., 1998; Hitzcmanand Pocsio, 1998).
These studies claim, on the one hand,that the use of referents in naturally occurring texts im-poses constraints on the interpretation f discourse; and,on the other, that the structure of discourse constrains theLPAs to which anaphors can be resolved.
The oddnessof the situation can be explained by lho fac!
that bothgroups seem primafilcie m be right.
Empirical exper-iments studies that employ linear techniques for deter-mining the LPAs o1' almphol's report recall and precisionanaphora resolution results in the range of 80% (Lappinand Leass, 1994; Ge ct al., 1998).
Empirical experimentsthat investigated the relation between discourse structureand reference also claim that by exploiting the structureof discourse one has the potential of determining correctco-referential links for more than 80% of the referentialexpressions (Fox, 1987; Cristca et al, 1998) although todate, no discourse-based anaphora resolution system hasbeen implemented.
Since no direct comparison of thesetwo classes of approaches has been made, it is difficult todetermine which group is right, and what method is thebest.In this paper, we attempt o Iill this gap by empiri-cally comparing the potential of linear and hierarchicalmodels el' discourse to correctly establish co-referentiallinks in texts, and hence, their potential to correctly re-solve anaphors.
Since it is likely that both linear- anddiscourse-based anaphora resolution systems can imple-ment similar FILTER and PI~,I~FERENCE strategies, we fo-cus here only on the strategies that can be used to COL-208LECT lists of potential antecedents.
Specilically, we fo-ct, s on deterlnining whether discourse llteories can helpan anaphora resolution system detemfine LPAs that are"better" than the LPAs that can be contputed from a lin-ear interpretation f texts.
Section 2 outlines the theoreti-cal assumptions of otu" empirical investigation.
Section 3describes our experiment.
We conclude with a discussionof tile results.2 Background2.1 AssumptionsOur approach is based on the following assmnptions:I.
For each anaphor in a text, an anaphora resolutionsystem must produce an LPA that contains a refer-ent to which 111e anaphor can be resolvcd.
The sizeof this LPA wuies fronl system to system, depend-ing on tile theory a system implements.2.
The smaller the I,PA (while retaining a correct an-tecedent), the less likely that errors ill the \]7tI,TH{:(lid PI',V,I;F, RI;,NCI ~, modules wil l  affect the ability ofa system to select the appropriate referent.3.
Theory A is better than lheory B for the task of rel-erence resolution if theory A produces I J 'As thatcontain more antecedents o which amtphors can becorrcclly resolved than theory B, and if the l,l~Asproduced by theory A arc smaller than those pro-duccd by theory B. l;or cxaml)lc, if for a givenanaphor, theory A produces an I,PA thai contains areferee to which the anaphor can be resolved, whiletheory B produces an IJ~A that does not containsuch a re\[eree, theory A is better than theory B.Moreover, if for a given anaphor, theory A producesan Lt)A wilh two referees and theory B produces anLPA with seven rel'crees (each LPA containing a ref-eree to which tile anal)her can be resolved), lheoryA is considered better than theory 11 because it has ahigher probability of solving that anaphor correctly.We consider two classes of models for determining theLPAs of anaphors ill a text:Linear-k models.
This is at class of linear models inwhich the LPAs include all the references foulad in thediscourse unit under scrutiny and the k discourse unitsthat immediately precede it.
Linear-0 models an ap-proach that assumes that :tll anaphors can be resolvedintra-unit; Linear- 1 models an approach that cor,'espondsroughly to centering (Grosz et al, 1995).
Linear-k is con-sistent with the asslunl)tions that underlie most currentanaphora resohltion systems, which look back h units inorder to resolve an anaphor.l) iscourse-V1:k models.
In |his class ()1'models, LPAsinclude all lhe refcrentM expressions fotmd in the dis-course unit under scrutiny and the k discourse units thathierarchically precede it.
The units that hierarchicallyprecede a given unit are determined according to VeinsTheory (VT) (Cristea et al, 1998), which is describedbrielly below.2.2 Veins TheoryVT extends and formalizes the relation between dis-course  s t ruc ture  and reference proposed by Fox (1987).It identilies "veins", i.e., chains of elementary discourseunits, over discourse structure trees that are built accord-ing to the requirements put forth in Rhetorical StructureTheo,y (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988).One of the conjectures ()1' VT is that the vein expres-sion of an elementary discourse unit provides a coher-ent "abstract" of the discourse fi'agmcnt hat containsthat unit.
As an internally coherent discottrse fragment,most ()1' the anaphors and referentM expressions (REstin a unit must be resolved to referees that oceul" in thetext subs:used by the units in tile vein.
This conjec-ture is consistent with Fox's view (1987) that the unitsthat contain referees to which anaphors can be resolvedare determined by the nuclearity of the discourse unitsthal precede the anaphors and the overall structure of dis-course.
According to V'I; REs of both satellites and nu-clei can access referees of hierarchically preceding nt,-cleus nodes.
REs of nuclei can mainly access referees ofpreceding nuclei nodes and of directly subordinated, pre-ceding satellite nodes.
And the interposition ()1' a nucleusafter a satellite blocks tim accessibility of the satellite forall nodes that att'e lovcer in the corresponding discoursestructure (see (Cristea et al, 1998) for a full delinition).Hence, the fundamental intuition unde,lying VT isthat the RST-spceilie distinction between nuclei andsatellites constrains the range of referents to whichanaphors can 19e resolved; in other words, the nucleus-satellite distinction induces for each anaphor (and eachreferential expression) a Do,naita of Refcrenlial Acces-sibility (DRA).
For each anaphor a in a discourse unit~z, VT hypothesizes that a can be resolved by examin-ing referential expressions that were used in a subset o1'the discourse units that precede it; this subset is calledthe DRA of u.
For any elcntentary unit u in a text, thecorresponding DRA is computed autonmtically from therhetorical representation f that text in two steps:1. lteads for each node are computed bottom-up overthe rhetorical representation tree.
Heads ()1" elemen-tary discottrse traits are the traits themselves.
Headsof internal nodes, i.e., discourse spans, are con>pt, ted by taking the union of the heads of the im-mediate child nodes that :ire nuclei.
For example,for the text in Figure I, whose rhetorical structure isshown in Figure 2, the head ()1' span 115,711 is unit 5because the head ()t' the inmmdiate nucleus, the ele-mentary unit 5, is 5.
However, the head of span 116,7\]is the list (6,7) because both immediate children arenuclei of a multinuclear relation.2.
Using the results of step 1, Vein expressions areeOmlmted top-down lbr each node in the tree.

Ube l ieve  that the field is emerging and i~prepared to break loose,12.\[he\[said.Figure 1: An example of text and its elementary units.The |'eferential expressions surrounded by boxes and el-lipses correspond to two distinct co-referential equiv-alence classes.
Referential expressions urrounded byboxes refer to Mr: Casey; those surrounded by ellipsesrefer to Genetic Thercq~y Inc.are computed recursively according to tile rules de-scribed by Cristea et al(1998).
The DRA ot" a unit uis given by the units that precede u in 1t~e vein.For example, for the text and RST tree in Figures 1and 2, the vein expression of unit 3, which containsunits 1 and 3, suggests that anaphors from unit 3should be resolved only to referential expressionsin units 1 and 3.
Because unit 2 is a satellite tounit 1, it is considered to be "blocked" to referen-tial links fi'om trait 3.
In contrast, tile DRA of unit9, consisting o1' units 1, 8, and 9, reflects the intu-ition that anaphors l?om unit 9 can be resolved onlyto referential ext)ressions fi'om unit 1, which is themost important trait in span \[1,7\], and to unit 8, asatellite that immediately precedes unit 9.
Figure 2shows the heads and veins of all internal nodes inthe rhetorical representation.2.3 Comparing modelsThe premise underlying out" experiment is that there arepotentially significant differences in the size of the searchspace rcquired to resolve referential cxpressions whenusing Linear models vs. Discou|'se-VT models.
For ex-ample, for text and tile RST tree in Figures 1 and 2, theDiscourse-VT model narrows tlle search space requiredto resolve the a|mphor the smaller company in unit 9.According to VT, we look lbr potential antecede|Us forthe smaller company in the DRA of unit 9, which listsunits I, 8, and 9.
The antecedent Genetic Therapy Inc.appears in unit 1 ; therefore, using VT we search back 2units (units 8 and 1) to lind a correct antecedent.
In con-trast, to resolve the same reference using a linear model,four units (units 8, 7, 6, and 5) must he examined be-fore Genetic The;zq?y is found.
Assuming that referen-tial links are established as tile text is processed, GeneticTherapy would be linked back to pronottn its in unit 2,which would in turn be linked to the first occurrence ofthe antecedent,Genetic Therapy Inc., in unit 1, tile an-tecedent determined irectly by using V'EIn general, when hierarchical adjacency is considered,an anaphor may be resolved to a referent hat is not theclosest in a linear interpretation of a text.
Simihu'ly, aref-erential expression can be linked to a referee that is notthe closest in a linear interpretation of a text.
However,this does not create problems because we are focusinghere only on co-referential relations of identity (see sec-tion 3).
Since these relations induce equivalence classesover tile set of referential expressions in a text, it is suf\[i-cient that an anaphor or referential expression is resolvedto any of the members of the relevant equiw|lence class.For example, according to V'I, the referential expressionMI: Casey in unit 5 in Figm'e 1 can be linked directlyonly to the referee Mr Casey in unit 1, because the DRAo1' unit 5 is { 1,5}.
By considering the co-referential linksof the REs in the other units, tile full equivalence classcan be determined.
This is consistent with tile distinctionbetween "direct" and "indirect" references discussed byCristea, et al(1998).3 The Experiment3.1 MaterialsWe used thirty newspaper texts whose lengths variedwidely; the mean o- is 408 words and tile standard e-viation/t is 376.
Tile texts were annotated manually forco-reference r lations of identity (Hirschman and Chin-chef, 1997).
Tile co-reference relations define equiv-alence classes oil the set of all marked referents in atext.
Tile texts were also manually annotated by Marcuet al (1999) with disconrse structures built in the styleof Mann and Thompson (1988).
Each discourse analy-sis yielded an average of 52 elementary discourse units.See (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997) and (Marcu et al,1999) for details of tile annotation processes.210H = 1 9 *V=lg*t I= l"?r ... = 1 9 * .

Based on this information, we cval-ualed the potential of each of the two classes (51" mod-els discussed in secdon 2 (Linear-k and Discourse-VT-k)to correctly establish co-referential links as follows: Foreach model, each k, and each marked referential expres-sion o., we determined whether or not tlle correspondingLPA (delined over k elementary units) contained a ref-eree from the same equiwdence class.
For example, forthe Linear-2 model and referential expression lhe .vmallercompany in t, nit 9, we estimated whether a co-refercntiallink could be established between the smaller companyand another referential expression in units 7, 8, or 9.For the Discourse-VT-2 model and the same referentialexpression, we estimated whether a co-referential linkcould bE established between the smaller company andanother eferential expression in units 1, 8, or 9, whichcorrespond to the DRA of unit 9.qb enable a fair comparison of the two models, when kis la,'ger than the size of the DRA of a given unit, WE ex-tend thatDRA using the closest units that precede the unitunder scrutiny and are not ah'eady in the DRA.
Hence,for the Linear-3 model and the referential expression thesmaller conq~any in trait 9, we estimate whether a co-referential link can be established between the xmallercompany and another eferential expression in units 9, 8,7, or 6.
For tile Discourse-VT-3 model and tile same rcf-ermltial expression, we estimate whclher a co-referentiallink can be established between the smaller company andanother eferential expression in units 9, 8, 1, or 7, whichcorrespond I(5 the DRA of mill 9 (unfls 9, 8, and 1) and tounit 7, the closest unit preceding unit 9 that is not  ill ilsI)RA.For the l)iscottrse-VT-k models, we assume Ihat theFxtended DRA (EDRA) of size \]c of a unit ~t.
(EDRAz: ('~))is given by the lh'st 1 _< k units of a sequence thatlists, in reverse order, the units of the DRA of '~z plusthe /c - l units that precede tt but arc not in its DRA.For example, \['or the text in Figure 1, the follow-ing relations hold: EDRAc,(!))

),8, 1,7,6.
For Linear-k inodels, theEDRAz:(u) is given by u and the k units that immedi-ately precede ~t.The potential p(M,  a, EDRA,~) (5t' a model M to de-termine correct co-referential links with respect o a ref-Erential expression a in unit u, given a correspondingEDRA of size k (EDRAt.
(u)), is assigned the value 1 ifthe EDRA contains a co-referent from the same equiwt-lence class as a.
Otherwise, p(M, ,, EDRAt~) is assignedthe value O.
The potential p(k4, 6', k) of a model Mto determine correct co-rEferential links for all referen-tial expressions in a corpus of texts C, using EDRAsof size k, is computed as the SUlll oF the potentialsp(M, a.,EI)RA#) of  all referential expressions ct in C'.This potential is normalized to a wdue bEtweEn 0 and1 by dividing p(k/l, C, k) by the number ot' referential211expressions in the corpus that have an antecedent.By examining the potential of each model to correctlydetermine co-referential expressions for each k, it is pos-sible to determine the degree to which an implementa-tion of a given approach can contribute to the overallefficiency of anaphora resolution systems.
That is, if agiven model has the potential to correctly determine asignificant percentage of co-referential expressions withsmall DRAs, an anaphora resolution system implement-ing that model will have to consider fewer options over-all.
Hence, the probability of error is reduced.3.2.2 ResultsThe graph in Figure 3 shows the potentials of the Linear-k and Discourse-VT-k models to correctly determine co-referential links for each k from 1 to 20.
The graph inFigure 4 represents he same potefftials but focuses onlyon ks in the interval \[2,9\].
As these two graphs how, thepotentials increase monotonically with k, the VT-k mod-els always doing better than the Linear-k models.
Even-tually, for large ks, the potential performance of the twomodels converges to 100%.The graphs in Figures 3 and 4 also suggest resolutionstrategies for implemented systems.
For example, thegraphs suggests that by choosing to work with EDRAsof size 7, a discourse-based system has the potential ofresolving more than 90% of the co-referential links ina text correctly.
To achieve the same potential, a linear-based system needs to look back 8 units.
I fa system doesnot look back at all and attempts to resolve co-referentiallinks only within the unit under scrutiny (k = 0), it hasthe potential to correctly resolve about 40% of the co-referential links.To provide a clearer idea of how the two models differ,Figure 5 shows, for each k, the value of the Discourse-VT-k potentials divided by the value of the Linear-k po-tentials.
For k = 0, the potentials of both models areequal because both use only the unit in focus in order todetermine co-referential links.
For k = 1, the Discourse-VT-1 model is about 7% better than the Linear-!
model.As the value of k increases, the value Discourse-VT-k/Linear-k converges to 1.In Figures 6 and 7, we display the number of excep-tions, i.e., co-referential links that Discourse-VT-k andLinear-k models cannot determine correctly.
As onecan see, over the whole corpus, for each k _< 3, theDiscourse-VT-k models have the potential to determinecorrectly about 100 more co-referential links than theLinear-k models.
As k increases, the performance of thetwo models converges.3,2,3 Statistical significanceIn order to assess the statistical significance of the differ-ence between the potentials of the two models to estab-lish correct co-referential links, we carried out a Paired-Samples T Test for each k. In general, a Paired-SamplesT Test checks whether the mean of casewise differencesbetween two variables differs from 0.

Forvalues of k larger than or equal to 4, the difference was nolonger significant.
These results are consistent with thegraphs shown in Figure 3 to 7, which all show that thepotentials of Discourse-VT-k and Linear-k models con-verges to the same value as the value of k increases.3.3 Comparing the effort required to establishco-referential links3.3.1 MethodThe method escribed in section 3.2.1 estimates the po-tential of Linear-k and Discourse-VT-k models to deter-mine correct co-referential links by treating EDRAs assets.

We estimate this effort using a very simple metricthat assumes that the closer an antecedent is to a cor-responding referential expression in the EDRA, the bet-ter.
Hence, in estimating the effort to establish a co-referential link, we treat EDRAs as ordered lists.
For ex-ample, using the Linear-9 model, to determine the correctantecedent of the referential expression the smaller com-pany in unit 9 of Figure 1, it is necessary to search backthrough 4 units (to unit 5, which contains the referent Ge-netic Therapy).
Had unit 5 been Ml: Cassey succeeds M.James Barrett, 50, we would have had to go back 8 units(to unit 1) in order to correctly resolve the RE the smallercompany.
In contrast, in the Discourse-VT-9 model, wego back only 2 units because unit 1 is two units awayfi'om unit 9 (EDRA:~ (9) = 9, 8, 1,7, 6, 5,4, 3, 2).We consider that the effort e(AJ, a, EDRAa.)
of amodel M to determine correct co-referential links withrespect o one referential, in unit u, given a correspond-ing EDRA of size L" (EDRA~.
(,)) is given by the numberof units between u and the first unit in EDRAk(u) thatcontains a co.-referential expression of a.The effort e(M, C, k) of a model M to determine cor-rect co-referential links for all referential expressions ina corpus of texts C using EDRAs of size k was computedas the sum of the efforts e(M, a, EDRAk) of all referen-tia !
expressions a in C.3.3.2 ResultsFigure 8 shows the Discourse-VT-k and Linear-k effortscomputed over all referential expressions in the corpusand all ks.
It is possible, for a given referent a and agiven k, that no co-referential link exists in the units ofthe corresponding EDRAa..
In this case, we consider thatthe effort is equal to k. As a consequence, for small ksthe effort required to establish co-referential links is sim-ilar for both theories, because both can establish only alimited number of links.
However, as k increases, theeffort computed over the entire corpus diverges dramat-ically: using the Discourse-VT model, the search spacefor co-referential links is reduced by about 800 units for acorpus containing roughly 1200 referential expressions.3.3.3 Statistical significanceA Paired-Samples T Test was performed for each k. Foreach text in the corpus and each k, we determined theeffort of both VT-k and Linear& models to establish cor-rect co-referential links in that text.
For all ks the dif-ference in effort was statistically significant.
For exam-ple, for k = T, we obtained the values t = 3.5l, df =29, P = 0.001.
These results are intuitive: becauseEDRAs are treated as ordered lists and not as sets, theeffect of the discourse structure on establishing correctco-referential links is not diminished as/,' increases.4 ConclusionWe analyzed empirically the potentials of discourse andlinear models of text to determine co-referential links.Our analysis suggests that by exploiting the hierarchi-cal structure of texts, one can increase the potential2137000 .

If one treats all discourse units in thepreceding discourse qually, the increase is statisticallysignificant only when a discourse-based coreference sys-tem looks back at most four discourse units in order toestablish co-referential links.
However, if one assumesthat proximity plays an important role in establishing co-referential links and that referential expressions are morelikely to be linked to referees that were used recently indiscourse, the increase is statistically significant no mat-ter how many units a discourse-based co-reference sys~tern looks back in order to establish co-referential links.Acknowledgements.
