A SNAPSHOT OF KDSA KNOWLEDGE DF_,LIVERY SYSTEMJames A. Moore end Will iam C. MannUSCIlnformaUon Sciences InstituteMarina del Ray, CAJune,  1979SUMMARYKDS Is a computer program which  createsmul t l -par~raph,  Natural Language text from a computerrepresentat ion of knowledge to be delivered.
We haveaddressed a number  of Issues not previously encountered Inthe generat ion of Natural Language st the mult i -sentencelevel, vlz: ordering among sentences and the scope of each,qua l i ty  comparisons between alternative 8~regat ions ofsub-sentent Ja l  units,  the coordination of communicationw i th  non- l ingu is t ic  activities by ?
gcel-pursuin~ planner,end the use of dynamic models of speaker and hearer to shapethe text  to the task at hand.STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMThe task of KDS is to generate English text under thefo l low ing  constraints:1.
The source of information Is a semantic net, having noa priori  s t ructur ing  to facilitate the outputt lng task.This  represents the most elaborate performance of KDS todate.SYSTEM DESIGNThe KDS organization reflects our novel paradigm:FRAGMENT- AND-COMPOSE.
KDS decomposes the originalnetwork  into fragments then orders and 8~regatas  theseaccording to the dictates of the text-producing task, notaccording to the needs for wh ich  the internal representationwas  or ig inal ly  conceived.
KDS has shown the feasibil ity ofth is  approach.The KDS organization Is a simple pipeline: FRAGMENT,PLAN, FILTER, HILL-CLIMB, and OUTPUT.FRAGMENT transforms the selected portion of thesemant ic  net into an unordered set of propositions wh ichcorrespond, roughly,  to minimal sentences.2.
The text is produced to satisfy an explicit goal held bythe text generat ing system, wh ich  describes a desiredcognit ive state of the reader.3.
To achieve the desired state of the reader equires morethan a single sentence.R ESULTSThis is not the forum for a extensive analysis of ourresults;  for details, see Mann and Moore \[ 1979\].

A typical planning rule is:"When conveying a scene in wh ich  the hearer is toident i fy  h imsel f  w i th  one of the actors, express ellproposit ions involving that actor AFTER those wh ichdo not, and separate these two partitions by aparagraph break' .FILTER, deletes from the set, ell propositions current lyrepresented as known by the hearer.HILL-CLIMB coordinates two sub-activities:AGGREGATOR applies rules to combine two or threef ragments  into a single one.
A typical aggregation rule is:"The two fragments 'x does A' and 'x does B' can becombin~!
into a single fragment: 'x does A and B'".PREFERENCER evaluates each proposed new fragment,produc ing a numerical  measure of its "goodness".
A typicalpreference ru le is:"When instruct ing the hearer, lncremm theaccumulat ing measure by 10 for each occurrence ofthe symbol  'YOU'".HILL-CLIMB uses AGGREGATOR to generate new candidatesets of f regments,  and PREFERENCER, to determine wh ichnew set presents the best one-step improvement over thecur rent  set.The objective funct ion of HILL-CLIMB has beenenlarged to also take into ecceunt the COST OF FOREGONEOPPORTUNITIES.
This has drastically improved the initialperformance,  since the topology abounds wt th  local maxima.KDS has used, at one time or another, on the order of 10p lann ing rules,  30 aggregation rules and 7 preference rules.51The aggregation and preference rules are directlyanalogoua to the capabilities of l inguistic eempotence andperformance,  respectively.OUTPUT l sa  simple (two pages of LISP) text generatordr iven by a context free grammar.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe work  reported here was supported by NSF GrantMCS- 76-07332.REFERENCESLevin, J.
