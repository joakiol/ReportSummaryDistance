The interpretation of non-sentential utterances in dialogueDavid Schlangen Alex LascaridesSchool of Informatics, University of Edinburgh{das|alex}@cogsci.ed.ac.ukAbstractWe present an overview of a compre-hensive formal theory of the interpreta-tion of sentential fragments, which hasas components an empirically validatedtaxonomy, an analysis of the syntax andcompositional semantics of fragments,and a formalisation of their contextualinterpretation.
We also briefly describean implementation of this theory, andquantify the potential practical use ofhandling fragments in dialogue systems.1 IntroductionIn dialogue settings, people frequently produce ut-terances which, despite being non-sentential, con-vey propositions, questions or requests.
For in-stance, B?s utterance in (1) of the NP ?John?
con-veys in this context the proposition ?John came tothe party.?
(1) A: Who came to the party?B: John.Clearly, the interpretation of such non-sententialutterances or fragments, as they are traditionallycalled (eg.
(Morgan, 1973)) is highly context de-pendent.
In this paper we present an overview ofa comprehensive formal theory of the interpretationof fragments.1The theory has as components an empirically val-idated taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and com-positional semantics of fragments, and a formal-isation of their contextual interpretation.
We alsobriefly describe an implementation of this theory,1More details can be found in (Schlangen, 2003).and quantify the potential practical use of handlingutterances of this kind in dialogue systems.The main thesis of our approach is that the res-olution of the intended content of fragments can bemodelled as a by-product of the establishment ofcoherence in dialogue, which (following much ofthe work on discourse) we define as the establish-ment of a meaningful connection of the content ofthe current utterance to its discourse context.
Wewill show that the constraints on the form and con-tent of fragments follow from such connections.There has recently been some renewed interestin fragments.
For example, (Carberry, 1990) of-fers an approach where computationally expens-ive plan-recognition techniques are employed fortheir interpretation.
As we will show, this failsto predict certain empirical facts and further, wewill show that the complex reasoning with cognit-ive states that she employs can often be replacedwith much simpler inferences based on linguisticinformation.
(Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) on the otherhand uses grammar-based methods which, as wewill show, are too weak to explain the interpreta-tion of certain kinds of fragments where their miss-ing content is linguistically implicit and has to beinferred.
Moreover, we will show that the non-compositionality of that approach has certain dis-advantages.The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-lows.
We first describe our empirically validated,two-dimensional taxonomy of fragment-types andsay something about the distribution of these typesin corpora.
In our theory, the type instantiated bya given fragment determines how it is resolved, butbefore we formalise this in Section 5, we present inSections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the se-mantics and syntax of such utterances in isolation.This separation of grammar and resolution has cer-tain advantages, as we discuss in comparison to pre-vious work.2 A Taxonomy of Fragments2.1 The TaxonomyWe classify fragments according to two dimen-sions.
In the first dimension, the criterion for clas-sification is the source of the material that is neededfor resolution.
In examples like (1), all informa-tion that is required to resolve the meaning of thefragment (we will soon say something about whatkind of information we assume this to be, syntacticor semantic) is present in the context: the resolu-tion ?John came to the party?
can be computed byidentifying the ?missing?
content in ?John?
with ele-ments from the utterance it is related to, ie.
the ques-tion.
We call this type of resolution resolution-via-identity.
However, there are also examples whererequired information is linguistically implicit, as in(2).
(2) A: Why did John leave?B: Exams.If John is a student and this fact is mutually knownby the dialogue participants, then B?s utterance ispresumably resolved to something like ?John leftbecause he has to take an exam soon?.
This res-olution contains elements that are not linguisticallyexplicit in the utterance to which the fragment is areply; the resolution has to be inferred, from bothlinguistic sources (the content of the fragment andthe content of its discourse context) and also extra-linguistic sources (knowledge about preparing forexams, for example).
Hence we call this type ofresolution resolution-via-inference.
We will showbelow that there are different constraints on frag-ments of these types.In the second dimension fragments are categor-ised by their discourse-function or rhetorical rolewith respect to elements of the context.
For ex-ample, in both (1) and (2), the fragment providesan answer to a question, and so we call the typethese fragments instantiate Question-Answer Pair(QAP).2 As this name suggests, strictly speakingthis dimension does not classify fragments as such,but rather the relation a given fragment has to ele-ments of its context.
To make this explicit, our typesare defined as relations, that is, the element of the2That both (1) and (2) instantiate this type showsthat the dimensions are indeed independent, since as dis-cussed above in the first dimension they belong to differ-ent classes.context the fragment connects to is explicitly partof what individuates the type.3As a theoretical backbone for the taxonomy, weused the rhetorical relations defined by a theoryof discourse structure called SDRT (Asher, 1993;Asher and Lascarides, 2003), which is also theframework in which we formalised the resolutionof fragments.
However, we also used corporato motivate the set of fragment-types in our tax-onomy.
We manually identified all instances ofnon-sentential utterances in a number of transcriptsof dialogues and classified their relation to the con-text.4 The resulting list of relations is given inTables 1 and 2, together with informal definitionsof the semantics of each relation (where ?
is thefragment and ?
the utterance it is related to) andan example instance.
We will not go into more de-tails of the types here; in Section 5 we will returnto a select few and give a formal definition of theirsemantics.
Note that we do not claim that this setof fragment-types is exhaustive; we discuss in thenext section the coverage that can be achieve withit on test data.5 As a final point, note that we sub-sume what is often called ?clarification question?(eg.
(Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)) under Elabora-tion to stress the similarity with ?normal?
elabora-tions.
The subscriptspandqindicate the messagetype of ?
and ?
; e.g.
Elabpqis an elaboration of aproposition, performed with a question.2.2 Corpus StudyTo test the coverage that can be achieved withour taxonomy, we analysed 5087 items of generalfree conversation from the BNC (dialogues KSUand KSV), and 4037 items of task-oriented dia-logue from the VM/redwoods corpus (the 125 dia-logues on the VM-CD-ROM 6).6 We proceeded3All taxonomies of fragment-types that are knownto us use classes that are at least partially determinedby the rhetorical function of the fragment (eg., that of(Carberry, 1990) as well as that of (Ferna?ndez and Gin-zburg, 2002)); nevertheless, to our knowledge ours is theonly one to make this inherent relationality explicit in theformal definition of the classes.4For this we used two dialogue transcripts from theBNC (Aston and Burnard, 1998) and five dialogues fromthe Verbmobil corpus (Wahlster, 2000).5A systematic omission are relations that connect re-quests.
In the dialogues we looked at (which were nego-tiations and free conversation) these did not occur; how-ever, in more task-oriented dialogues they will presum-ably be quite frequent.
Note that there is no principledreason for not including them, and our approach couldeasily be extended accordingly.6We held out this data in the compilation stage, andso ?training?

?Table 2: Speech act types that can be realized withNSUs (contd)in two stages, first semi-automatically identifyingnon-sentential utterances (using the wide-coveragegrammar described below as a filter for sentential-ity) which we then classified according to the tax-onomy, or with other if no decision could bemade.7Results Numbers about the frequency of frag-ments in our corpus and about the achieved cover-age overall are presented in Table 3.
For reasons ofspace, we cannot show the detailed distribution ofthe classes here; what is noteworthy about it is thatthe majority of fragment instances is concentratedin a few classes, with the rest of the classes onlyrepresented by a few examples each.
The most fre-quent type is QAP, followed by Elabpqand Elabpp,7For this study we only used one annotator, so we can-not present inter-annotator agreement measures.
Furtherstudies are underway at the moment that will give us suchdata.whereas types like Expl?q, Q-Alt and Contr werefound only a few times.SUMMARYitems analysed 9142Fragments 931 (= 10.2%)classfd.
865 (= 93% of fragments)other 66 (= 7% of fragments)Table 3: Results of AnnotationDiscussion The overall percentage of fragmentswe have found seems to confirm the results ofearlier studies (Thompson, 1980; Ferna?ndez andGinzburg, 2002), which also classified as frag-ments around 10% of the utterances in the dialoguesthey looked at.
(Ferna?ndez and Ginzburg, 2002)also offers a taxonomy of fragment types; the au-thors claim to have reached a coverage which ismuch higher than what we achieved (99% com-pared to our 93%).
We think this can partially beexplained by the fact that the classes they use aremore surface-oriented.
For example, they have aclass ?sluice?, which is defined as ?bare question-denoting wh-phrases?
(Ferna?ndez and Ginzburg,2002, p.16).
We make a finer distinction, split-ting this class further according to the rhetoricalfunction played by the fragmental question (eg.,Explq, Expl?q, Narrq, Elabq).
Hence, to classify agiven fragment we need more information about itsrhetorical function; information which sometimesis difficult to recover from a transcript.
While asurface-oriented approach to defining classes is anadvantage for annotation, it is a hindrance for form-ally defining their semantics, as we will argue be-low.In conclusion, we think that this corpus study hasshown that our taxonomy has satisfactory empiricalmotivation.
In the next two sections we look at frag-ments in isolation.
We return to the taxonomy whenwe give an example of the formal semantics of re-lations and show how they determine the resolutionof the fragments.3 A Compositional Semantics forFragmentsFor compositional semantic analysis we use Min-imal Recursion Semantics (MRS, (Copestake et al,1999)), a language in which partial descriptions offormulae of a logical language (the base language)can be expressed.
This allows one to leave cer-tain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting theidea that syntax supplies only partial informationabout meaning.
Technically this is achieved via astrategy that has become standard in computationalsemantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labelsto bits of base language formulae so that state-ments about their combination can remain ?under-specified?.
The (first-order) models of formulae ofthis latter language then can be seen as standing ina direct relation to formulae of the base language;M |= ?
then means that the (unique) base-languageformula corresponding to M is described by theMRS ?.8 By way of example, (3) shows an MRS-representation of ?Everyone loves someone?, whereso-called elementary predications (EPs) are labelledwith handles (hn), with h being the top handle thatoutscopes all others; ?h1=qh2?
stands for an ?out-scopes?
relation between EPs where only quantifierscan be scoped in between h1and h2; prpstn rel sig-nals that the MRS describes a proposition.
(3) ?h; e; {h : prpstn rel(h1); h2: love v rel(e; x1; x2);h6: every rel(x1; h8; h9);h10: person rel(x1);h11: some rel(x2; h12; h13);h14: person rel(x2)};{ h1=qh2; h8=qh10; h12=qh14}?The compositional semantics of fragments leavesmore information unresolved than just semanticscope, however.
All we know about the meaning offragments like those in (1) and (2) independent fromtheir context is: (a) they will resolve to a proposi-tion,9 of which (b) the main predicate is unknown,but (c) one participant in the main event is specifiedalthough its exact role isn?t.
We represent this withan anaphoric relation unknown rel, and so the NP-fragment ?John.?
(regardless of the context it standsin) is represented as:(4) ?h; e; {h : prpstn rel(h1);h2: unknown rel(e; x);h6: def np rel(x; h8; h9);h10: named(x; John)};{ h1=qh2; h8=qh10} ?The unknown rel acts as a ?place-holder?
for a po-tentially complex sub-formula; more precisely it isa constraint on the form of the described (base-8Such a semantics if given to MRS in (Copestake etal., 2001); we follow the similar formalisation in (Asherand Lascarides, 2003).
Note that we do not make anyassumptions about the base language and its logic here;the descriptions are compatible with it being static firstorder predicate logic, or a dynamic logic like DRT (Kampand Reyle, 1993).9We make the simplifying assumption that there isan unambiguous intonation pattern indicating whether afragment is intended to convey a proposition, a questionor a request.language) formulae, that they contain at this placea subformula, which in the case of (4) must have eand x amongst its variables.
Clearly, such a descrip-tion then describes an infinite number of formulae;however, all of these are potential resolutions of thefragment.
For instance, (4) (partially) describes theintended resolution of the fragment in context (1)?
?John came to the party.?
?, but it also describes forexample ?Carl loves John.?
or ?Sandy thinks thatKim relies on John.
?, which can be resolutions inother contexts.It is important to note that unknown rel is not asecond order variable (as it would be in an approachin the vein of (Dalrymple et al, 1991)), and it is notsomething that simply gets replaced by a predicatesymbol of the same arity.
Rather, unknown rel is aconstraint more like the =q-constraints, constrain-ing the ?shape?
of the described formulae.
It is ana-phoric, because the sub-formula that is to be inser-ted at this point in the described formula is not de-termined by the grammar, but must be provided bythe context.4 A Grammar of Fragments4.1 The AnalysisOur grammatical analysis of fragments is relativelystraightforward: we make the assumption that frag-ments are phrases,10 possibly modified by adverbs.As (5) shows, only scopally modifying adverbs areallowed.11(5) A: Who sang this song?B: Maybe Sandy.
/ *Badly Sandy.In a pseudo phrase-structure notation, the rulessimply are of the form ?S-frag ?
(ADV) XP?.
Weformalise this in a version of HPSG that allows con-structions (Sag, 1997) (ie.
phrase-types that makea semantic contribution) and that uses MRSs as se-mantic representations.
HPSG-representations ofthese semantic structures consist of a feature IN-DEX whose value represents the semantic index ofthe sign; a feature LTOP that holds the handle of thesign, ie.
a label for the bits of logical form intro-duced by it; LZT, which is a bag of labelled EPs;and H-CONS, which collects the constraints on the10This goes back to (Morgan, 1973); explicit rulescan be found in (Barton, 1990).
We ignore for nowmore complicated examples like ?A: Does John devouror nibble at his food?

as a declarative fragment.The formalisation is best explained with an ex-ample.
Figure 1 shows, in a tree representation, thesign for the NP-fragment ?John.?
It demonstrateshow the NP is lifted to the level of sentences, andhow the semantics of that sentence is composed.Let?s work ?top-down?
to describe this Figure indetail.
The root-sign in this tree has all the syn-tactic features of a sentence: the value of its SYN-SEM.LOCAL.CAT is of type verb, and all valence re-quirements are satisfied.
It is also semantically likea sentence, in that its top-EP (with the handle 2 ) isof type message (more precisely, a prpstn).
ThisEP is contributed by the fragment-rule, via the fea-ture C-CONT (construction content).
In the sameway the unknown rel-constraint that was intro-duced in the previous section is added.
The con-nection of this constraint to the semantics of thephrase is made via co-indexation of the argument-slot of unknown rel with the INDEX of the argu-ment phrase (in Figure 1 this is 5 ).As the type-declaration in Figure 1 shows, thissign is the combination of two types, namelyheaded-phrase, which is a general type that definesthe features and co-indexations in headed phrases;and np-nm-decl-frag, which collects the specifica-tions particular to fragments.
This type in turn in-herits from three further types: np-frag, which spe-cifies the particularities of fragments consisting ofNPs; nm-frag, which specifies non-modified frag-ments (ie., a phrase that is not modified by an ad-verb); and decl-frag, which indicates that the frag-ments resolves to a proposition.
These three typesencapsulate properties of fragments that can varyindependently; see the hierarchy in Figure 2.We assume a generalised head-feature principle(ghfp) as in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) accordingto which all values for SYNSEM-features on themother are by default token-identical to those of thedaughter, and hence we have to make sure that thefragment-types override this default where appro-priate.
For example, the value for SYNSEM.LOCALof fragments must be specified on the types for thefragments, since it will always be different fromthat of the head daughter?raising different XPs tosentences is the whole point of the rule, and so thedefault of the ghfp to copy these specifications mustbe overridden.
The value of SYNSEM.LOCAL.CATwill be the same for all types of fragments, namelythat of a sentence.
In fact, the only elements of thetype instantiated in Figure 1 that are specific to NP-fragments are the co-indexation of the INDEX of thehead (the NP) with the ARG of the unknown rel,and the restriction that the phrase be an NP.
So theconstraint unique to NP-fragments (ie., the specific-ation of the type np-frag) is that shown in (6).

?Finally, the last dimension organises the differencesin the type of message to which the fragment willresolve.
The example we have seen in Figure 1was one of a propositional-fragment; fragmentalquestions or requests only differ in the type of thismessage-relation.

]The rules in this dimension also make sure that wh-phrases must be int-frags.4.2 ImplementationWe have implemented our analysis in a wide-coverage HPSG, the English Resource Grammar(ERG, see for example (Copestake and Flickinger,2000));12 the implementation was evaluated us-ing the grammar-profiling tool [incr tsdb()](Oepen and Flickinger, 1998).
First, to test forpossible adverse effects on the analyses of full-sentences, we ran a batch-parse of a test-suite offull sentences, the CSLI-test-suite which is distrib-uted with [incr tsdb()].
It consists of 1348sentences, of which 961 are marked as syntacticallywell-formed and 387 as ill-formed.
Table 4 showsa comparison of the original ERG with our extendedversion containing the fragment rules, with respectto the average number of parses per sentence.12The implementation differs slightly from the analysisdescribed in the previous section: the ERG doesn?t makeuse of defaults, and so we had to explicitly state what isidentical between mother and daughter and what isn?t.msg-type frg-type frg-arg-typeimp-frag int-frag decl-frag mod-frag n-mod-frg nom-frag vp-frag s-comp-frgnp-frag pp-fragpp-f-frag pp-l-frag... np-m-decl-frg np-nm-decl-frg ...Figure 2: An extract of the construction hierarchy for fragmentsVersion of Grammar Average # parsesLinGO ERG, 20/11/02 2.86ERG+frag 3.69Table 4: Competence comparison of the originalERG with the fragment-ERGAs these data show, the fragment rules introducesome new ambiguity, but on average less than onemore parse per item.
We conclude from this thatadding the fragment-rules doesn?t lead to an ex-plosion of readings that would render the grammarpractically unusable.
What this evaluation doesn?ttell us, however, is whether the additional readings(of what is meant to be full sentences) are erroneousor not.
The problem is that ?fragmenthood?
is not asyntactic criterion, and so some strings that can beanalysed as sentences can also be analysed as frag-ments.
E.g., ?leave?
can be both an imperative sen-tence and a VP-fragment (e.g.
in the context of thequestion ?What did John make Sandy do??
).To test the coverage of our extended grammar,we used parts of the annotated corpus describedin Section 2.2.
In 4037 items we identified 369fragments, of which our grammar correctly parsed242 (= 65.5%).
A detailed study of the frag-ments that were not recognised showed that a use-ful extension would be rules for handling fragmentsof the form ?CONJ XP?, eg.
?and on Saturday.?
;including those would bring our coverage up to82.6% of the corpus.
This result is in the sameorder of magnitude as what the original grammarachieves on full sentences, and is in the range ofwhat the best wide-coverage grammars that providesemantic representations at present can achieve.However, although extending the grammar in thisway is straightforward it would lead to a dramaticrise in the number of average parses, and so forpractical purposes we did not carry out such an ex-tension here.5 Computing the Intended Meaning ofFragments5.1 TheoryThe final problem we have to address is how theunderspecified semantic representations that ourgrammar produces for fragments are resolved con-textually.
For this, we use a theory of discourseinterpretation called SDRT (Asher and Lascarides,2003).
This theory attempts to enrich dynamic se-mantics with techniques for encoding the contribu-tion of pragmatics.
One central notion of dynamicsemantics (eg.
(Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the up-date of a representation of the context with that ofnew information; in SDRT, this update is depend-ent on non-monotonic inferences over linguisticand non-linguistic information.
SDRT?s update-operation is defined on descriptions like MRSs;it simply adds constraints on the form of logicalforms.
The inferred information that is most im-portant for us is the speech act type (e.g.
QAP,Elabpp) that connects the new information to thecontext; this is what we used to classify fragmentsin Section 2.These speech acts are computed via default rules;to give an example, the rule for IQAP is shown be-low.
In this rules, ?
?, ?, ??
means ?
is to be attachedto ?
with a rhetorical relation (?
and ?
label bits ofcontent) where ?
is part of the discourse context ?
;?
:?
means that ?
is an interrogative, and A > Bmeans If A then normally B:13(9) IQAP: (?
; ; ?
?
:?)
> IQAP(; )This rule stipulates that the default contribution of aresponse to a question is to supply information fromwhich the questioner can infer an answer.
Thus in-ferences about speech acts, and hence about impli-cit content and goals, can sometime be triggered (bydefault) purely on the basis of sentence moods.
For13(Asher and Lascarides, 1998) shows that some ruleslike this can be derived from a precise model of rational-ity and cooperativity.other speech acts, information about speaker-goalsmight be required; however, the general principle isto always minimise the need for such information.We now address resolving the underspecificationindicated by unknown rel.
In particular, we arguethat there are certain constraints on the form ofresolution-via-identity fragments which do not ap-ply to resolution-via-inference fragments.
We de-rive these different constraints from a general dis-course coherence principle, but before we come tothis, we have to show what these constraints are.We begin with questions and answers like (1).Intuitively, one can say that there is a ?hole?
inquestions like (1) or (10), marked syntactically bythe wh-phrase and semantically by a variable (bethat bound by a ?-operator, as in (Groenendijk andStokhof, 1984) or by a quantifier, as in the ERG).
(10) A: Who came to the party?B: Not Sandy.This initially suggests that to resolve the content ofthe fragment, one could attempt to do syntactic re-construction, ?plugging?
the syntactic structure ofthe fragment into the (syntactic) ?hole?
in the ques-tion (cf.
(Morgan, 1973)).
Unfortunately, as (Gin-zburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) attest, sucha strategy fails for some cases; eg.
for (10) above:?
*Not Sandy came to the party.
?On the other hand, G&S also attest that a purelysemantic reconstruction, where the semantic rep-resentation of the fragment is ?plugged into?
the(semantic) ?hole?
in the question, is also unsatis-factory.
Certain grammatical idiosyncrasies seemto persist beyond sentence boundaries.
This canbe shown with example (11) (from G&S, p.300).Here the fragmental answers must be of the syn-tactic category required by the verb in the question(VP[bse] and VP[inf ], respectively), even thoughthe semantic objects denoted by these VPs presum-ably are of the same type.14(11) a.
A: What did he make you do?
?
B: Singb.
A: What did he force you to do?
?
B: Tosing.G&S model this constraint by restricting short an-swers to be syntactically parallel to the questionthey answer.
This however is too strict, as ex-amples like (2) show, which is a short answer aswell but does not exhibit such ?parallelism?.
Weexplain the observation in a less direct but more14For a further discussion of the exact extent of thisparallelism see (Schlangen, 2002).general way.
First of all, our theory is declarat-ive: it describes the form of the preferred resolu-tion (it?s the one that satisfies the coherence con-straints of the rhetorical relations), but not neces-sarily how it is generated.
We assume as a gen-eral discourse principle that resolutions which are(semantic-)structurally very close must satisfy acertain syntactic constraint which says that sub-categorization requirements must be satisfied, too.Hence our principle can rule out resolutions even ifthey satisfy the semantic constraints (eg., it wouldrule out the ?wrong?
combination of questions andanswers in (11) above), in case they violate that syn-tactic constraint.
The difference between (1) and(2) now is explained by different contextual require-ments.
In (2) there is another relation present be-sides QAP, namely Explanation.
The semantics ofthis former relation (namely that ?
explains the pro-positional content of ?)
puts additional semanticconstraints on the answer; the structural closenessis not required, and hence the fragment is exemptfrom the syntactic constraint.For reasons of space, we simply sketch the the-ory here, but we should stress that, following G&S,we also assume that certain syntactic informationpersists beyond sentence boundaries.5.2 ImplementationWe have partially implemented the theory describedhere in a computer program (see also (Schlangenand Lascarides, 2002)).
The resolution of res-via-id fragments is very straightforward to implement,since for them all possibilities can be generated viasimple abstraction and functional application oper-ations over the semantic representations.
That ofres-via-inf fragments is more problematic, and wehave only implemented it for a very limited domain,namely that of scheduling dialogues.
In this do-main, the discourse-plans are particularly simple,and so we can specify the required axioms for reas-oning with extra-linguistic information.
Again wecan?t go into details here and only note that eventhough we minimise the amount of extra-linguisticinformation that is needed, resolution of res-via-inffragments is a demanding task and can be auto-mated only for very restricted domains.6 Related WorkThe idea that content is determined by coherencerelations is of course not new, and has been imple-mented for example in (Hobbs et al, 1993), whichalso mentions in passing the problem of resolvingfragments in context.
However, this ?Interpreta-tion as Abduction?-theory (IAT) differs from our ap-proach in a number of important aspects.
First, un-like IAT?s weighted abduction where conflict amongthe clues to interpretation is handled by the ex-traneous logical machinery of weights, in our the-ory conflict is resolved automatically by the logicalconsequence relation itself.
Secondly, Hobbs et aldon?t consider the syntactic constraints on the resol-ution of fragments that we discussed above.
In fact,they seem to regard fragments as ?syntactically-illformed utterances?, and so do not make a differencebetween well-formed and ill-formed fragments.
Inprinciple, further constraints could be added to theITA framework, but at the cost of having to re-assignweights so that the results of inference are always asintended, and no princples or regulations are givenin (Hobbs et al, 1993) about how to do this.As mentioned in the introduction, (Ginzburgand Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) also offer anon-modular approach to the resolution of short-answers (and some other fragmental speech acts).
(12) shows a very schematic representation of theirapproach.
(12) S: Peter walks|QUD ?
NP: PeterWho walks?
||PeterA grammar rule specific to the use made of the frag-ment (in (12) as an answer) directly projects NPs assentences, with parts of the sentential content com-ing from a contextual feature QUD (question underdiscussion).
This grammar rule in one go checksthe syntactic constraints and constructs the intendedcontent of the fragment in its discourse context.In our opinion, our compositional approach hascertain advantages.
First, the grammatical analysisof fragments is uniform; contextual variation intheir meaning is accounted for in the same way asit is for other anaphoric phenomena, via inferencesunderlying discourse update.
This yields the secondadvantage: resolving fragments is fully integratedwith resolving other kinds of underspecification (al-though we have not shown this here; cf.
(Schlan-gen and Lascarides, 2002)).
Third, the interac-tion between grammar and pragmatics is straight-forward: pragmatics enriches information comingfrom the grammar.
In G&S?s approach the grammarhas to ?decide?
on the speech act that has been per-formed (the grammar-rules are specific for eg.
an-swering, clarification); something that is normallyseen to be a defeasible process.
Hence, even inG&S?s approach a pragmatic module is required,which then has the task of filtering out unwantedparses.
Fourth, we have available a strong theoryof contextual interpretation which can explain thereasoning behind the resolution of examples like (2)(although we have not shown here in detail how);the functional application used by G&S seems tooweak to do this.
Fifth, our compositional approachallowed us to straightforwardly extend an existingwide-coverage grammar.
This contrasts with thenon-compositional approach which through its de-mands for making contextual information availableentails that standard parsers cannot be used withoutmodifications.
Lastly, the separation of the gram-mar and resolution components means that in the-ory our grammar can be used with different resolu-tion strategies; however, we have not systematicallyexplored that.As mentioned in the introduction, (Carberry,1990) offers an approach that uses plan-recognitiontechniques to resolve fragments.
While such anapproach can perhaps model res-via-inf cases, itseems to us needlessy powerful for fragment-typeslike (1), where purely linguistic information is suf-ficient.
Moreover, Carberry does not deal with thesyntactic constraints and so overgenerates possiblefragments.7 ConclusionsWe draw the following conclusions from the workpresented in this paper: fragments occur frequentlyin dialogues, namely relatively consistently around10% across dialogue types (but possibly more fre-quently in question/answer-based informative dia-logues).
This means that a principled approach totheir resolution is important for natural soundingdialogue systems, besides being of theoretical in-terest.
We have offered such an approach, begin-ning with a comprehensive taxonomy of fragment-types, through to a semantic and syntactic analysis,which we also implemented.
In that implementa-tion we identified for future work the sub-type offragments of the form ?CONJ XP?
(eg.
?and onMonday.?
