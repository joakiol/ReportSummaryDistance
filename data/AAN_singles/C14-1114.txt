Paris-SudOrsay, France{nguyen,xtannier,moriceau}@limsi.frAbstractThis paper tackles the problem of timeline generation from traditional news sources.
Our sys-tem builds thematic timelines for a general-domain topic defined by a user query.
The systemselects and ranks events relevant to the input query.
Each event is represented by a one-sentencedescription in the output timeline.We present an inter-cluster ranking algorithm that takes events from multiple clusters as input andthat selects the most salient and relevant events.
A cluster, in our work, contains all the eventshappening in a specific date.
Our algorithm utilizes the temporal information derived from alarge collection of extensively temporal analyzed texts.
Such temporal information is combinedwith textual contents into an event scoring model in order to rank events based on their salienceand query-relevance.1 IntroductionWe aim at building thematic timelines from multiple documents relevant to a specific, user-generatedquery.
For instance, for the query ?Libya conflict?, our system will return important events related tothe Libya conflict in 2011 involving Kadhafi forces, rebels, NATO intervention, etc.
(Figure 1).
Sucha timeline can then be visualized as a textual, event-based summary, or through any existing graphicaltimeline visualization tool.The main contribution of this paper is a two-step inter-cluster ranking algorithm aimed at selectingsalient and non-redundant events from temporal clusters, which are sets of sentences describing eventsrelated to the query and that occurred at the same day.
In the first step, a scoring model is proposed torank sentences describing events, according to their relevance and salience to the topic.
In the secondstep, the ranked events are iteratively reranked based on their content in order to reduce informationredundancy.
We finally obtain an extendable, chronological summary of important events concerning thequery.This paper is organized as follows: ?2 introduces related work.
?3 presents the resources used andgives an overview of the system.
The salient date algorithm proposed by Kessler et al.
(2012), that weused to build our temporal clusters, is briefly summarized in ?4.
?5 and ?6 describe our ranking approachto event selection and a content-based reranking algorithm, respectively.
The evaluations are presentedin ?7.
?8 is dedicated to the conclusion and future work.2 Related WorkOur work is closely related to event detection and tracking (EDT) and multidocument summarization(MDS).
This section introduces some important work in these fields.2.1 Event Detection and TrackingEDT on news streams has been intensively studied.

(Sayyadi et al., 2009).
These papers do not consider time, which is an essential dimension of eventtimelines.Attempts to use temporal information for EDT are significant in the literature.
To name but a few,Alonso et al.
(2009) apply time-based clustering on search results.
Yan et al.
(2011) use documenttimestamps to calculate temporal proximity for timeline generation from web documents.
Similarly,Zhao et al.
(2007) use text similarity and time intensity for event clustering on social streams.
Kessleret al.
(2012) exploit temporal analysis to detect salient dates of an event from raw text.
Following thisdirection, Battistelli et al.
(2013) apply sequential pattern mining to select a one-sentence description foreach salient date of an event.2.2 Multidocument SummarizationSentence extraction is essential in extractive text summarization.
In the unsupervised approach, sentencesare scored using term weight and term proximity induced from a document collection (Goldstein et al.,2000).
In the supervised approach, training data generated from reference summaries are used to learnclassification or ranking models.
New sentences are selected based on their confidence value on learnedmodels (Wan et al., 2007).
As information comes from documents on the same topic, it should be noticedthat it is also important to reduce redundancy in MDS (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).Filippova (2010) builds a co-occurrence word graph from a collection of related sentences and gener-ates a generic summary from the graph based on shortest path finding.
Her algorithm is a hybrid methodbetween extractive and abstractive approaches to MDS.3 Resources and System Overview3.1 Corpus and ChronologiesFor this work, we use a corpus of newswire texts provided by the AFP French news agency.
The EnglishAFP corpus is composed of 1.3 million texts that span the 2004-2011 period (511 documents/day inaverage and 426 millions words).
Each document is an XML file containing title, document creationtime (DCT), set of keywords, and textual content split into paragraphs.AFP ?chronologies?
(textual event timelines) are a specific type of articles written by AFP journalistsin order to contextualize current events.
These chronologies may concern any topic discussed in themedia, and consist in a list of dates (typically between 10 and 20) associated with a text describing therelated event(s).
Figure 1 shows an example of such a chronology.
Note that several important eventscan occur at the same date.3.2 System OverviewFigure 2 shows the general architecture of the system.
When the user submits a query, sentences areretrieved by the Lucene search engine and are clustered by the dates appearing in those sentences (step?1209RANK RERANKRANKED EVENTSTEMPORAL CLUSTERSEXTENDABLE TIMELINETHEMATIC CLUSTERSMarch 22 April 2ndMarch 111.2.3.4.?..............1.2.3.4.
?..............QUERY Salientdates(Kessler et al., 2012)Relevance and SalienceRedundancy??
?Figure 2: System overview.in the Figure (Kessler et al., 2012)).Then, all sentences are ranked by the relevance and salience of described events.
This is done bymodeling event relevance and salience as a scoring function (step ?).
Thematic clusters are created byapplying clustering on the set of events on the same date.
Finally, sentences are reranked by an iterativealgorithm aiming at reducing redundancy from the initial list (step ?)
to achieve an extendable timeline.4 Temporal ClustersAs stated in the introduction, our main contribution in this paper is to rank and select salient and non-redundant sentences from clusters, in order to build query-based timelines.
We rely on the algorithmproposed by Kessler et al.
(2012) for building temporal clusters.
This section is a quick overview of theirapproach.4.1 PreprocessingA temporal analysis is performed on all documents from the AFP corpus (see ?3.1) with the Heidel-time (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013) parser.
The main purpose is to collect as much temporal information aspossible.
Absolute dates and DCT-relative dates are extracted and normalized (full dates represented ina common format).
DCT-relative dates are those which are relative to the date on which the documentis published, such as ?Yesterday?
(day before DCT), ?next Friday?
(first Friday following the DCT) or?on Friday?
(can be first Friday preceding or following the DCT, depending on the tense of the verb thatgoverns the temporal expression).In a corpus containing 426 millions words, 845,000 absolute dates and 4.6 millions relative dates weredetected and normalized.4.2 Temporal Cluster BuildingAt query time, temporal clusters (or ?salient date sets?)
are then built with the help of a search engine(Lucene in that case1).
Articles are indexed by Lucene at sentence-level (a document = a sentence).1http://lucene.apache.org1210...launched the first air strike on March 19 , has deployed around 20 Rafale and Mirage......last week, said they were arrested on Saturday along with Getty photographer Joe Raedle......since coalition air strikes began Saturday , a figure that could not be confirmed......United State to launch air raids on March 19 , are in a hurry to get out of whether NATO...Figure 3: All the temporal expressions in the following sentences were normalized at date level as ?Mar19 2011?.Given the query, a number of sentences are retrieved by search engine.
Dates are extracted from thesesentences.
These dates are then ranked by their ?salience?
in the set of documents.
The idea behind thenotion of salient date is that if a date is important in a sub-corpus (Lucene output), then we can say thatimportant events occurred at this date, and then that these events must appear in a timeline.In practice, salience is mostly defined by the number of occurrences of the date in the documents fromthe search engine, as well as some other features that are used to feed a machine learning classifier.The output of this salient date algorithm is then a ranked list of dates, where each date comes togetherwith a set of sentences that contain this date and that are relevant to the query.
We call temporal clustersthese sets of sentences linked to a specific date (see Figures 2 and 3).5 Event RankingOur ranking mechanism relies on the mutual relation between relevance and salience.
It aims at rankingevents based on these two factors.
The problem of information redundancy will be addressed by areranking step in ?6.
Our principal motivation is that an event has more chance to be selected into atimeline if it is both relevant to the topic and important, or in other words, salient w.r.t other relatedevents.
The concepts of relevance and salience are realized in our ranking function by considering termproximity and date frequency, respectively.Previous works in event detection normally formalize events as individual terms or syntactic patterns,which facilitates the use of text content.
Instead, as our method utilizes both time and text content, wecome to a formalization of an event as a pair of its mentioned date and its one-sentence description.Given an input query, the aim of ranking is to select the most relevant and salient events.
The relevanceof an event is calculated by vector-based query similarity, and augmented by the average relevance of itscontaining thematic cluster.
Salience is contributed by date frequency and averaged term weight.
As aresult, the overall score of an event e given a query q is the multiplication of the following four factors:score(e|q) =rele(e|q)?
relcl(cl|q)?
saliencee(e|d, q)?
salienced(d|q),(1)where:?
rele(e|q) is the relevance of e to q (see ?5.1).?
relcl(cl|q) is the relevance of a thematic cluster cl to q, which is the averaged relevance of itsmembers (see ?5.2).?
saliencee(e|d, q) is the salience of e w.r.t the date d that the event happens.
It is calculated as theaverage salience of the terms in its one-sentence description.
Term salience, in turn, is calculatedbased on term frequency in the date cluster (see ?5.3).?
salienced(d|q) is the salience of d w.r.t to q.
Date salience is the averaged salience of all the eventsin that date (see ?5.4).12115.1 Event Relevance: rele(e|q)The motivation behind considering relevance is that if an event is relevant to the query then it is animportant event.
We use the conventional TFIDF vector space model with bag-of-word assumption torepresent document and query vectors.
For relevance, the similarity between document and query vectorsis the built-in Lucene score formula2,rele(e|q) = cosine(~e, ~q) ?
normL(~e, ~q).
(2)5.2 Thematic Cluster Relevance: relcl(cl|q)Date salience does not always correctly reflect the importance of event.
For instance, the date of Haitiearthquake considers the earthquake itself as the main event.
However, related events such as the sorrowexpression of UN Secretary General also happen immediately after the earthquake but still in the samedate.
Such satellite events will have the same date salience as the central event.
In another case, a datewhen there is no central event but there are many ?consequent?
events will also have a high salience value.E.g., on the day after the earthquake, international aids are planned; number of victims is estimated;aftermath events are invoked, etc.Those examples show that the ?one event per date?
assumption is weak in reality.
To overcomethis weakness, we apply an hierarchical clustering technique, in which two clusters are merged if theirnormalized Manhattan distance is lower than a threshold ?, to generate thematic sub-clusters inside adate cluster3.
In in-house experiments, we observed that different values of ?
did not significantly varyperformance.
We hence selected ?
= 0.5 for our system.The score of each thematic cluster is thencalculated as averaged document relevance,relcl(cl|q) =?erele(e|q)|cl|.
(3)5.3 Event Salience: saliencee(e|d, q)An important event tends to contain salient terms.
Those terms, in turn, tend to occur frequently on adate.
We hence come to measure term salience as its frequency of occurrence on the date f(t|d, q), andevent salience as the averaged salience of its terms.
For term normalization, stopwords are removed andtokens are normalized by the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1997).saliencee(e|d, q) =?t?ef(t|d, q)|e|?t?
?df(t?|d, q)(4)5.4 Date Salience: salienced(d|q)The use of temporal clusters, i.e.
date clusters, is motivated by the observation that an important eventhappens on a salient date.
Date salience is the total relevance of all events happening on that date (thenumerator):salienced(d|q) =?erele(e|q)?d?erele(e|q).
(5)The denominator is used to normalize date salience so that it is comparable to other factors in (1).6 Event RerankingThe score described in previous section leads to a ranked list of salient and relevant events.
However, itdoes not consider the fact that some information can be redundant between events.
The reranking algo-rithm presented in this section strives to reduce such redundancy.
In principal, information redundancy is2https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_2/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html3In our implementation, for each one-sentence document, we used the whole texts of its containing article to create itsdocument vector.
Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute difference of term weight between two clusters1212Rank Date Event DescriptionNO RERANK1 Mar 31 2011 The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation takes over formal command of the military operation.2 Mar 31 2011 NATO took command of operations over Libya on March 31.3 Mar 31 2011 NATO takes command of the coalition campaign.4 Mar 19 2011 [...] French, US and British forces launch UN-mandated air strikes and push them back.5 Mar 30 2011 Libyan foreign minister Mussa Kussa defects.... ... ...RERANK1 Mar 31 2011 The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation takes over formal command of the military operation.2 Mar 19 2011 [...] French, US and British forces launch UN-mandated air strikes and push them back.3 Mar 30 2011 Libyan foreign minister Mussa Kussa defects.4 Mar 23 2011 US Defence Secretary Robert Gates on Wednesday held talks in Cairo on the conflict in Libya [...]5 Apr 04 2011 [...] photographer Manu Brabo disappeared on April 4 while covering the conflict in Libya.... ... ...{2} Mar 31 2011 NATO took command of operations over Libya on March 31.... ... ...{3} Mar 31 2011 NATO takes command of the coalition campaign.... ...

The algorithm iteratively recomputes eventsalience (hence the overall event score) based on used/unused terms as follows:salience?e(e|d, q) =?t?
?ef(t?|d, q)|e|?t?
?df(t?|d, q), (6)where t?is an unused term on the date d. A used term is the one that already occurred in better-rankedsentences.
This formula is different from (4) in the distinction between used and unused terms.
Eachtime a new event is selected, its appropriate list of used terms is updated with the terms in the one-sentence description of the selected event.
Each date has its own list of used/unused terms.The algorithm for reranking is provided in Algorithm 1.
At first, the score of all sentences related tothe query S(q) is calculated using the formula (1) with event salience defined in (6) (lines 3-5).
Then,the highest scored sentence is selected into the output (lines 6-7) and is removed from the pool.
In line8, d?is the date when the event e happens: d?= date(e?).
The list of used terms on its date is updatedwith the terms from that selected sentence (lines 9-11).
A new iteration restarts by recalculating score ofunselected sentences according to new lists of used terms.
The algorithm terminates after K iterations,i.e.
when K events have been selected into timeline.Figure 4 illustrates the effect of reranking on the order of events in a timeline.

created by the Rank-Rerank method.
Events are shownin chronological order, each accompanied with its rank starting from 1, displayed as a number between().7 EvaluationsOur system for building timelines is named as RaRE, as short for ?Rank and RErank?.
We use a setof 91 chronologies manually written by expert journalists from the AFP news agency (Figure 1) asgolden reference summaries for evaluation.
As our generated timelines are extendable, we need to defineits length for evaluation.
Considering the characteristics of reference summaries, we decide that if areference summary of a timeline contains k events, we appropriately use only the k highest ranked eventsin the timeline for evaluation (Figure 5).
The evaluations of the date selection and summary generationare presented in ?7.1 and ?7.2, respectively.7.1 Evaluate Date SelectionWe evaluate the dates selected by timelines returned by our system.
The purposes of this evaluationare two-fold: i) Since time (as date in our case) is an essential dimension of chronological timeline, itis necessary to evaluate the time selected by timelines; ii) The novelty of this work w.r.t Kessler et al.
(2012) is the mixture of content and temporal information.
We need to show empirical evidences that atleast, this mixture does not break the performance of date selection.The dates occurring in a timeline are compared with the dates occurring in its reference timeline usingMean Average Precision (MAP) metric.
It should be noted that by using MAP@k as evaluation metric, adate with higher rank has more impact than another date with lower rank.
We use two systems presentedin Kessler et al.
(2012), named as DFIDF and ML in Table 1, for comparison as follows:?
DFIDF is an unsupervised system solely relying on date frequency with a tfidf-like scoring function.This method uses the AFP corpus, the same as the one used in our work.
As the AFP corpus istemporally analyzed, the method indexes all the occurrences of dates in the corpus.
Dates are thenscored and ranked with so-called DFIDF, a tfidf-like scoring mechanism.?
ML is a supervised system that learns a classifier and ranks unseen dates based on classificationSystem MAPDFIDF 71.46ML 79.18RaRE 77.83Table 1: Comparison of salient date detection using MAP.1214System P RDFIDF?27.24 25.50ML?29.93 27.54RaRE-no-rerank 28.82 24.47RaRE 31.23 26.63Table 2: Comparison of MDS using ROUGE at 95% confidence interval.confidence.
The method leverages the dates in reference summaries to create training data withsalient/non-salient examples.
Temporal features such as date frequency, DCT, novelty, etc., areextracted to learn an adaptive boosting classifier.As shown in Table 1, our method is close to ML.
This result is encouraging as ML requires trainingdata; and on the other hand, our system is not designed to directly solve the task of date selection.
Asexpected, our system beats the unsupervised system DFIDF by a large margin.
This superiority showsthat the mixture of temporal information and content leads to an improvement on date selection overusing only the former.7.2 Evaluate Summary GenerationIn order to evaluate timelines as text summaries, we ignore dates and consider all the entries in a timelineas one summary.
We use ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004) to evaluate generated timelines against referencesummaries.The following baselines are implemented (Table 2): In DFIDF?, salient dates are taken from theoutputs of the DFIDF system described in previous section.
Each salient date is equivalent to a clustercontaining all the events happening in that date.
We then select the event the most relevant to the query,i.e.
the event with the highest Lucene score, as representative of that salient date.
Note that consequently,DFIDF?makes an assumption, which is not assumed in RaRE, that there is only one event happens ina particular date.
The same assumption is presumed in Battistelli et al.
(2013).
However, because theirsystem is particularly designed for French and is intended to parse small corpora, we could not conducta direct comparison with their method.
ML?is built similarly to DFIDF?, except that salient dates areinstead taken from the ML system.
The RaRE-no-rerank system is identical to RaRE in the ranking step,but the reranking step is omitted.Our system is superior to DFIDF?as expected.
Moreover, it outperforms ML?, even though ML?performs better on the task of date selection.
Among these three systems that combine temporal infor-mation and textual contents for summary generation, our system is the most successful.
Furthermore,RaRE outperforms RaRE-no-rerank, which shows that reducing redundancy by reranking improves theperformance of summary generation.8 Conclusion and Future WorkWe presented a two-step inter-cluster ranking algorithm for event selection.
The rank step sorts eventsbased on their salience and query relevance.
The event scoring function is based on both date frequencyinduced from temporal analyzed texts and term weighting induced from contents to reflect these twofactors.
The rerank step allows to reduce information redundancy by using inter-sentence dependencybetween the descriptions of events happening in the same time period (i.e.
the same date in this work).Ranking based on sentences may be sensitive to sparsity.
In the future, we will expand local contexts,for instance, to neighboring sentences, to acquire richer textual representation of events.
One remainingissue is that reference chronologies, written by the journalists, are very subjective, and that we have onlyone example of chronology per topic.
In the future, we will conduct a manual evaluation in order tocomplete results from this automatic evaluation.
With the help of a validation interface, journalists willbe provided ranked list of events w.r.t.
their queries.
They will then be able to select and edit the eventsthat they wish to validate for their future timelines.
Such an interface will both help journalists to producenew timelines, and bring a new evaluation methodology for our system.1215AcknowledgementsThis work has been partially funded by French National Research Agency (ANR) under project Chrono-lines (ANR-10-CORD-010).
