In early research on automated text creation, the operationalized structural relationsfrom Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) \[Mann & Thompson 88\] were used both to carry the speaker'scommunicative intention (which enabled the use of a NOAH-like top-down expansion planner) and also toensure coherence (by utilizing the constraints on Nucleus and Satellite from RST).
This dual functionalityis characteristic of the operators used in the various text structure planners that have been built to date,whether they were oriented more toward surface text structure (such as the relation/plans of the RSTStructurer \[Hovy 88, Itovy 90\]) or more toward the communicative intentions underlying the text (as thetext plans of the EES and PEA text planner in the later \[Moore & Paris 89, Moore 89\] work) 1.However, the resulting perspective shift from surface (RST) oriented toward intentional did engenderconsiderable discussion about the types of discourse structure relations and the form of discourse structureitself.
In work collecting and classifying relations from many sources, \[Maier & Hovy 91, Hovy & Maier 93\]eventually created a taxonomy of three types of relations: ideational (semantic), interpersonal (intentional),and textual (rhetorical); for a more expanded taxonomy see \[Hovy et al 92\].
Though the details were notexplicitly spelled out, the idea was that a discourse can (arid should) be described by at least three structuresin parallel: the semantic, the interpersonal, and the rhetorical.Recently, Moore and Pollack published a paper \[Moore & Pollack 92\] in which they show tile need fortwo accounts of discourse structure, the semantic (what they call informational) and the interpersonal (whatthey call intentional).
They also offer a convincing example to show that these two structures are not ingeneral isomorphic.
With these claims I have absolutely no problems - -  see the discussion of multiple parallelrelations in \[Hovy et al 92\] - -  except the fact that it doesn't go far enough.
It doesn't recognize the needfor the rhetorical relations.
The current paper argues for the need for an additional, rhetorical, structtn'e todescribe discourse.1 It is important o understand that merely using plan operators with more "intentional" names does not guarantee thateither the text planner or the resulting tcxt structure ncapsulate "intentionallty" in a real way (whatever "intentionality" nt;Lymean in this context).
When a text plan library includes both "intentional plans" and RST-like operators ide by side, andtile planner uses them interchangably, and they fulfill a similar function in the resulting discourse structure, then the diiferem:ebetween the two types of operator ass implemented is one of nomenclature ather than of true functionality, and is t|tns open toMcDermott's "Wishful Mnemonics" trap \[McDermott 81\].
The shift of nomenclature does however reflect a shift of perspe~:tiw:,namely the recognition that text planning should develop non-linguistic, intentionMity-orientcd terminology.
Tile true in,portof this shift is only gradually becoming apparent.35Why is there Syntax?I wouht like to describe a more complete model of discourse structure by analogy to single sentence structure.Tile typical model most of us have of single sentences includes two principal structures: a structure thathouses the semantic information (usually called the semantic structure, the f-structure in LFG \[Bresnan 78\],or possibly the deep structure \[Chomsky 65\]; the distinction is not relevant here) and a syntactic structurethat expresses the surface form of the sentence.Now ask yourself: why is syntactic structure necessary as a separate, autonomous construct?
If you havea well-formed semantic structure, possibly something like a case frame or a set of knowledge base assertions,and you define a regular traversal algorithm, possibly a depth-first left-to-right strategy, thcn for the surfacesentence you can simply produce a string of pairs: semantic function and filler.
In fact, most languages haveahnost this form: English (with pairs of preposition and filler) somewhat so; Japanese (with pairs of casemarker and filler) more so.
Under this view there's no need for a distinct surface structure - -  the wholesemantic structure is straightforwardly recoverable from the sentence itself.
Why then have all languagesevolved a syntax?One may surmise: the syntax of the language is nothing other than the trace of the traversal of thesemantic structure.Unfortunately, however, this cannot, hold: in general, the syntactic structure and the semantic structureare not isomorphic.
That is to say, either the semantics is not derivable from the syntax, or the syntaxcontains more information than the semantic structure.
Regardless of what theories of syntax and semanticsone follows, the statement of non-isomorphism would be supported, I believe, by all experts.Assuming that all required semantic structure is reflected in the syntactic structure, this non-isomorphismimplies that the syntactic structure contains other information as well.
Short of random inclusion of noise,there's no other explanation.A moment's thought provides the answer: the syntactic structure of a sentence contains additionalnon-semantic nformation.
The difference between active and passive voice, for example, is thematic, notsemantic.
The difference between "the door is closed" spoken normally (as a statement) and with a finalrising intonational contour (as a question) is not semantic, it is Speech Act-related, hence interpersonal.Briefly, then, syntactic form is a structure that merges information about the sentence from severalsources: semantics (for the primary content), discourse (for theme and focus), interpersonal goals and plans(for Speech Acts), and so on.
The syntactic structure cannot be isomorphic to any one of these componentsource structures alone, since it houses more information than any of them do individually.
Necessarily, also,tile syntactic structure is much closer to the surface form of the sentence than any of the other structuresare.The Model  of Discourse StructureI now return to discourse structure.
By analogy, I argue that the content of a discourse derives from severalsources, and that a common, surface-level-ish tructure is needed to house them all.
The major sources forthe content of a discourse are: the semantics of the message, the interpersonal Speech Acts, the "control"information included by the speaker to assist the hearer's understanding (namely information signallingtheme, focus, and topic), and knowledge about stylistic preferability.
We consider these four in turn.1.
Semant ic  in format ion:  In our normal computational pproaches, emantic information consistsof propositions in a knowledge base, possibly represented as case frames using terms defined in a taxo-nomic ontology.
The interpropositional linkages are relations that have been called semantic, ideational,or informational.
These include relations such as CAUSE, PART-WHOLE, IS-A, TEMPORAL-SEQUENCEpSPATIAL-SEQUENCE.2.
In terpersona l  in format ion:  For computational discourse, interpersonal information takes theform of communicative goals.
Properly, the goals should refer to the speaker, the hearer, and the desired36effect on the hearer' state of knowledge, state of happiness, state of belief, etc.
(which includes portionsof semantic information).
The interpersonal goals include MOTIVATE (someone to do something), JUSTIFY(one's own actions), EXPLAIN (the operation or development of something or some events), CONCEDE (apoint of contention), and so on.
Since we are still sorting out the various terms, the precise nature of thesegoals in a discourse planning system is not yet clear; I believe for example that we are still confusing thingsa little when we talk about "interpersonal relations", since what's interpersonal re not relations but goals.3.
Contro l  in format ion:  Despite the Attentional state in \[Grosz & Sidner 86\] and \[Moore 89\], theinclusion of control information in discourse planning systems has not received the attention it deserves,primarily I think because we do not understand clearly enough how discourse analysis works.
As arguedin \[Lavid ~z Hovy 93\], the speaker signals theme to indicate to the hearer where in the evolving discoursethe new sentence or group of sentences attaches; the speaker signals focus in the sentence to indicate to thehearer where in the clause the hearer should spend most inferential attention, and so on.
Mechanisms toperform this signalling include voice (active and passive), clause constituent ordering, pronoun use (pronounsrespect discourse boundaries), pitch range and stress (for spoken discourse), etc.4.
Style: As anyone knows after writing a text generator for a domain created by another person foranother task, the mismatch between representations suited to the task and representations suited to languagecan be daunting.
Usually, text generated irectly from domain-oriented representations is stylistically awfld,to say the least.
As argued in \[Rambow & Korelsky 92, Hovy 92\], several so-called senti:nee planning tasksmust be performed after text content selection and structuring and before actual surface realization.
Thesetasks include:?
clause aggregation: the operation of merging very similar representations into conjunctive clauses oas to remove redundancy ("Bush is sure to veto Bill 1711 and Bill 2104" instead of "Bush is sure toveto Bill 1711.
He is also sure to veto Bill 2104.")?
pronominalization determination: this operation depends on discourse structure and on stylistic factors?
clause-internal structure: whether, for example, an attribute is realized as a relative clause ("the book,which is blue...") or as an adjective ("the blue book..
.")?
certain types of lexical choice: the determination of verbs can significantly affect the local structure ofthe discourseAn example of aggregation is given at the end of the paper.The Rhetorical  StructurePity the poor speaker.
All this information, and more, must be packed into each clause!
Small wonder thata distinct structure, one much closer to the surface form of the discourse, is useful.
Just as in the case ofsingle-sentence syntactic structures, the discourse-level rhetorical structures require their own, multil)urpose,type of interclause relation - -  rhetorical relations.Rhetorical relations are the presentational nalogue of both semantic relations and interpersonal goals.While I do not think it is useful to identify a unique rhetorical partner for each semantic relation and eachinterpersonal goal, it doesn't seem surprising that certain strong correlates exit.
Just as semantic age:ntand patient pattern closely in English sentences with syntactic subject and direct object, just so semanticTEMPORAL-SEQUENCE patterns closely with rhetorical PRESENTATIONAL-SEQUENCE.
In fact, it also pat-terns closely with SPATIAL-SEQUENCE; such simplifications of semantic diversity are found in several areas,as where the semantic relations PART-WHOLE, PLAN-STEP, ABSTRACT-INSTANCE all pattern with rhetori-cal ELABORATION.
Exactly which rhetorical relations are most useful to define as separate ntitiesl and howthey co-pattern with semantic relations, interpersonal goals, and control information, remains a matter ofinvestigation.The rhetorical discourse structure (lifters from the semantic and the intentional structure.
Incorl)oratingas it does the effects of both, as well as of other constraints on the discourse, it is much closer to the surface37form of the text.
RST provides one attempt at providing rhetorical structure.
What has often been calleda liability of RST, namely that its analyses mirror the text so closely, is in fact a virtue - -  it representsa minimal step of abstraction away from the surface form, and does not discard information that is notdirectly semantic or intentional.
This is not to say that RST has no flaws; one of its principal problems isthe conflation of intentional, semantic, and rhetorical relations.
Not all the relations of RST are rhetorical- -  for example JUSTIFY and MOTIVATE are clearly intentional, and CAUSE and PART-WHOLE are clearlysemantic.What then does a rhetorical structure look like?
It is in fact a structure very familiar to us, the onethat first appears from considering text itself instead of the meaning or communicative intent thereof.
Toillustrate, I conclude with the Bush example and the problem of aggregation.One of the most common mismatches between the representations constructed for a domain-orientedknowledge base and the representations eeded for stylistically adequate generation occurs with multiplecopies of very similar information, which the text planner has to "aggregate" in order to reduce redundancy.In most knowledge representations, it is overwhelmingly likely that the propositions underlying sentence (1):(1).

George Bush supports big business.(2).
He is sure to veto House bill 1711.(3).
(And) Ite is sure (also) to veto House bill 2104.The problem of aggregating partially similar representations has been studied by several people in the textgeneration community (see for example \[Mann & Moore 80, Kempen 91, Dalianis & Hovy 93\]) but is still along way from being solved, involving as it does questions of conversational implicature (see \[Horacek 92\])and of style (see \[tIovy 87\]).
As described in \[Hovy 90\], the presence of a discourse structure greatly reducesthe problem of finding candidates for aggregation (from polynomial to sub-linear in the total number ofclause-sized representation clusters).
This kind of operation can only be performed on a fairly surface-leveldiscourse structure; a semantic or interpersonal does not contain the appropriate information.I think is is too early to try to define exactly what is and isn't part of the rhetorical structure; the mostuseful answers eem to crystallize from practical experience.
I believe that as examples of rhetorical structureone should consider RST trees as given in \[Mann & Thompson 88\], though few of the specific RST relationsused there are will in my opinion turn out to be most productive.
Instead, I believe that the relationsidentified in \[Martin 92\] and classified as Textual in \[Hovy et al 92\] will be more usefill.
I also believe thatthe rhetorical structure will not necessarily contain clauses at its leaves, but may in fact contain informationrt~aching "into" the clause itself; most likely as a set of attributes which the clause should exhibit, ratheralong the lines outlined in \[Meteer 90\].
The notions of Nucleus and Satellite seem to me very useful however.ConclusionGiven, in any text generation system, the stylistic necessity of performing such sentence planning tasks asaggregation, pronominalization, etc., not to mention the reorganizations of material caused by lexical choice,and given the complexity of managing the disparate ffects of these operations, a fairly surface-level structurethat governs the realization of the text becomes a practical necessity.
The interclausal relations employedin such a structure have to be fairly neutral in character, carrying as they do semantic, interpersonal, and"control" information simultaneously.
Though the precise format of the rhetorical discourse structure andits rhetorical relations remains a topic of ongoing study, the need for and utility of such constructs cannotbe denied by anyone who has actually tried to build a real system.38References\[Bresnan 78\] Bresnan, J.
