DEALING WITH INCOMPLETENESS OF LINGUISTIC KNOWLEDGEIN LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONTRANSFER AND GENERATION STAGE OF MU MACHINE TRANSLATION PROJECTMakoto Nagao, Toyoaki Nishida and Jun-ichi TsujiiDepartment of Electrical EngineeringKyoto UniversitySakyo-ku, Kyoto 606, JAPANI.
INTRODUCTIONLinguistic knowledge usable for machine trans-lation is always imperfect.
We cannot be free fromthe uncertainty of knowledge we have for machinetranslation.
Especially at the transfer stage ofmachine translation, the selection of target lan-guage expression is rather subjective and optional.Therefore the linguistic contents of machinetranslation system always fluctuate, and makegradual progress.
The system should be designed toallow such constant change and improvements.
Thispaper explains the details of the transfer and gen-eration stages of Japanese-to-English system of themachine translation project by the Japanese Govern-ment, with the emphasis on the ideas to deal withthe incompleteness of linguistic knowledge formachine translation.2.
DESIGN STRATEGIES2.1 Annotated Dependency StructureThe intermediate representation we adopted asthe result of analysis in our machine translationis the annotated dependency structure.
Each nodehas arbitrary number of features as shown in Fig.
i.This makes it possible to access the constituentsby more than one linguistic cues.
This representa-tion is therefore powerful and flexible for thesophisticated grammatical and semantic checking,especially when the completeness of semantic analy-sis is not assured and trial-and-error improvementsare required at the transfer and generation stages.2.2 Multiple L~aver GrammarWe have three conceptual levels for grammarrules.lowest level: default grammar which guarantees theoutput of the translation process.
The qualityof the translation is not assured.
Rules ofthis level apply to those inputs for which nohigher layer grammar rules are applicable.kernel level: main grammar which chooses and gener-ates target language structure according tosemantic relations among constituents which aredetermined in the analysis stage.topmost level: heuristic grammar which attempts toget elegant translation for the input.
Eachrule bears heuristic nature in the sense that itis word specific and it is applicable only tosome restricted classes of inputs.2.3 Multiple Relation StructureIn principle, we use deep case dependencystructure as a semantic representation.
Theoreti-cally we can assign a unique case dependency struc-ture to each input sentence.
In practice, however,analysis phase may fail or may assign a wrongstructure.
Therefore we use as an intermediaterepresentation a structure which makes it possibleto annotate multiple possibilities as well as mul-tiple level representation.
An example is shown inFig.
2.
Properties at a node is represented as avector, so that this complex dependency structureis flexible in the sense that different interpreta-tion rules can be applied to the structure.2.4 Lexicon Driven FeatureBesides the transfer and generation ruleswhich involve semantic checking functions, thegrammar allows the reference to a lexical item inthe dictionary.
A lexical item contains its spe-cial grammatical usages and idiomatic expressions.During the transfer and generation stages, the~erules are activated with the highest priority.This feature makes the system very flexible fordealing with exceptional cases.
The improvement oftranslation quality can be achieved progressivelyby adding linguistic information and word usages inthe dictionary entries.2.5 Format-Oriented Description o f  DictionaryEntriesThe quality of a machine translation systemheavily depends on the quality of the dictionary.In order to build a machine translation dictionary,we collaborate with expert translators.
We develop-ed a format-oriented language to allow computer-naive human translators to encode their expertisewithout any conscious effort on programming.Although the format-oriented language we developedlacks full expressive power for highly sophisticat-ed linguistic phenomena, it can cover most of thecommon lexical information translators may want todescribe.
The formatted description is automati-cally converted into statements in GRADE, a pro-gramming language developed by the Mu-Project.
Weprepared a manual according to which a man can fillin the dictionary format with linguistic data ofitems.
The manual guarantees a certain level ofquality of the dictionary, which is important whenmany people have to work in parallel.420(Due %0 the advance of electronic ins t rumentat ion ,  auwmsted  sh ip  increases in number .

ORGANIZATION OF GRAMMAR RULES FOR TRANSFERAND GENERATION STAGES3.1 Heurist ic Rule FirstGrammar rules are organized along the princi-ple that "if better  rule exists then the systemuses it; otherwise the system attempts to use astandard rule: if it fails, the system wi l l  use adefault rule."
The grammar rule involves a numberof stages for applying heurist ic  rules.
Fig.
3shows a processing f low for the transfer and gener-ation stages.Heurist ic rules are word specific.
GRADE makesit possible to define word specif ic rules.
Suchrules can be invoked in many ways.
For example, wecan associate a word select ion rule for an ordinaryverb in a dict ionary entry for a noun, as shown inFig.

!3.2 Pre-transfer RulesSome heuristic rulesare activated just after thestandard analysis of aJapanese sentence is finish-ed, to obtain a more neutral(or target language oriente~analyzed structure.
We callsuch invocation the pre-transfer loop.
Semantic andpragmatic interpretation aredone in the pre-transferloop.
The more heuristicrules are applied in thisloop, the better result willbe obtained.
Figs.
5 and 6show some examples.3.3 Word Selection inTarget Language byUsing Semantic MarkersWord selection in thetarget language is a bigproblem in machine transla-tion.
There are varietiesof choices of translationfor a word in the sourcelanguage.
Main principlesadopted in our system are,(i) Area restriction byusing field code, suchas electrical Engineer-ing, nuclear science,medicine, and so on.
(2) Semantic code attachedto a word in the analy-sis phase is used forthe selection o fapropertarget language word ora phrase.
(3) Sentential structure ofthe vicinity of a wordto be translated issometimes effective forthe determination of aproper word or a phrasein the target language.Table i shows examplesof a part of the verb trans-fer dictionary.
Selectionof English verb is done bythe semantic categories ofnouns related to the verb.The number i attached toverbs like form-l, produce-2 is the i-th usage of theverb.
When the semanticinformation of nouns is notavailable, the column indi-cated by ~ is applied toFig.

We developed a num-ber of dictionary formats speciallydesigned for the ease of dictionary in-put by computer-naive expert translators.The expressive power of format-oriented description is, however, insuf-ficient for a number of common verbssuch as "~ ~ " (make, do, perform .
.
.
.
)and "~ ~ " (become, consist of, provide,...) etc.
In such cases, we can encodetransfer rules directly by GRADE.
Anexample is shown in Fig.
7.
Varietiesof usages are to be listed up with theircorresponding English sentential struc-tures and semantic conditions.3.4 Post-Transfer RulesThe transfer stage bridges the gapbetween Japanese and English expressions.There are still many odd structuresafter this stage, and we have to adjustfurther more the English internal repre-sentation into more natural ones.
Wecall this part as post-transfer loop.An example is given in Fig.
8, where aJapanese factitive verb is first trans-ferred to English "make", and then astructural change is made to eliminateit, and to have a more direct expression.4.
GENERATION PROCESS4.1 Translation of JapanesePostpositionsPostpositions in Japanese general-ly express the case slots for verbs.
Apostposition, however, has differentusages, and the determination of Englishprepositions for each postposition isquite difficult.
It also depends on theverb which governs the noun phrase hav-ing that postposition.Table 2 illustrates a part of adefault table for determining deep andsurface case labels when no higher levelrule applies.
This sort of tables aredefined for all case combination.
Inthis way, we confirm at least one trans-lation to be assigned to an input.
Aparticular usage of preposition for aparticular English verb is written inthe lexical entry of the verb.4.2 Determination of Global SententialStructures in Target LanguageFig.

An example of dictionary transfer rulesof popular verbs.Grobal sentential structures of Japanese andEnglish are quite different, and correspondinglythe internal structure of a Japanese sentence isnot the same as that of English.
Fundamentaldifference from Japanese internal representationto that of English is absorbed at the (pre-, post-) transfer stages.
But at the stage of Englishgeneration, some structural transformations arestill required in such oases as (a) embeddedsentential structure, (b) complex sententialstructure.We classified four kinds of embedded senten-tial structures.
(i) a case slot of an embedded sentence is vacant,and the noun modified by the embedded sentencecomes to fill the slot.
(~)The  form like "NI~" V ~ N2" m " (N 2 ~ N I~ 'V  )N2".
In this case the noun N I must havethe semantic properties like parts, attributes,and action.
(~i~)The third and the fourth classes are particularembedded expressions in Japanese, which havethe connecting expressions like " ~  " (inthe case of), " ~9~ " (in the way that,"g~,P  " (in that), and so on.An example of the structural transformationis shown in Fig.
9.
The relative clause "vhy..."is generated after the structural transformation.Connection of two sentences in the compoundand complex sentences is done according to Table3.
An example is given in Fig.
i0.4.3 The Process of Sentence Generation in EnglishAfter the transfer is done from the Japanesedeep dependency structure to the English one,conversion is done to a phrase structure tree withall the surface words attached to the tree.
Theprocesses explained in 4.1 and 4.2 are involved atthis generation stage.
The conversion is perform-ed top-down from the root node of the dependencytree to the leaf.
Therefore when a governing verbdemands a noun phrase expression or a to-infinitiveexpression to its dependent phrase, the structuralchange of the phrase must be performed.

Structural transformation ofan embedded sentence.transformation are often required due to the differ-ence of expressions in Japanese and English.
Thisprocess goes down from the root node to all theleaf nodes.After this process of phrase structure genera-tion, some sentential transformations are performedsuch as follows.
( i ) When an agent is absent, passive transforma-tion is applied.
( ii ) When the agent and object are both miss ing,the predicative verb is nominalized andplaced as the subject, and such verb phrasesas "is made", and "is performed" are supple-mented.
(iii) When a subject phrase is a big tree, theanticipatory subject "it" is introduced.
( iv ) Pronominalization of the same subject nounsis done in compound and complex sentences.
( v ) Duplication of a head noun in the conjunctivenoun phrase is eliminated, such as, "uniformcomponent and non-uniform component" >"uniform and non-uniform components".
(v i )  Others.Another big structural transformation requiredcomes from the essential difference between DO-language (English) and BE-language (Japanese).
InEnglish the case slots such as tools, cause/reason,and some others come to the subject position veryoften, while in Japanese such expressions are neverused.
The transformation of this kind is incorpo-rated in the generation grannnar such as shown inFig.
ii, and produces more English-like expressions.This stylistic transformation part is still veryprimitive.
We have to accumulate much more linguis-tic knowledge and lexical data to have more satis-fiable English expressions.earthquake building collapsecollapse destroybuilding earthquake earthquake building= The buildings collapsed \[CPO:causal potency\]due to the earthquake.

SUMMARYThis paper described a number of strategieswe employed in the transfer and generation stagesof our Mu system to make the system both powerfuland fault-tolerant.
As is mentioned above, oursystem has many advantages such as the flexibilityof the generation process, the utilization ofstrong lexical information.
The system is in thecourse of development in collaboration with a num-ber of computer scientists from computer industriesand expert translators.
Some of the translationresults are attached in the last, which show thepresent level of the translation system.
Progres-sive improvement is expected in the next two years.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe acknowledge the members of the Mu-Project,especially, Mr. S. Takai(JCS), Mr. Y. Fukumochi(Sharp Co.), Mr. T.
