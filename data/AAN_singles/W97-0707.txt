A user walks up to the system and presents an articlefor summanzauon?
In the first case, the system asks another human to dothe summanzaUon and presents it to the user Theuser compares tins summary to lus/her own nouonof an ideal summary?
In the second case, the system automatically gener~ates a summary and returns it to the user The useragmn compares this summary to his/her own nouonof an Ideal summary?
The user saUsfaction m the above two cases Is mea-sured by the "degree of overlap" between the sum-mary presented by the system and the user's nouonof an ideal summary3Different users could count paragraphs &fferently Thus,for a few amcles, the lengths of the two manually generatedsummaries were different In such cases, the autoraaUc proce-dures took the average of these two lengths as the target lengthfor the extract43If  the user's sausfactton as about the same an the abovetwo cases, then our automatic summanzataon schemesare summanzang aswell as a human would summanzeby paragraph extracUonFor each automaue summanzaUon algonthm, fourquanUties were computed10pwmi .c  evaluatmn Smce the two manual ex-tracts for an amcle are chfferent, the amount ofoverlap between an automatic and a manual ex-tract depends on which manual extract as selectedfor comparison The opUmisuc evaluauon for analgonthm as done by selecung the manual extractwath winch the automatic extract has a Ingher over-lap,.and measuring tins overlap Tins as the same asusing the human whose noUon of an ~deal extract ~scloser to the automauc extract as our user2 Pesszrmstw evaluanon Analogously, a pessarmsticevaluation ~s done by Selecting the manual extractwith winch the automauc extract has a lower over-lap Thas as the same as using the human whose.notion of an adeal extract ~s more chss~rmlar to theautomatac extract as our user Tins, in some sense.as the worst case scenario3 Intersection For each arucle, an antersecuon ofthe two manually generated summaries as computedThe fact that he paragraphs an tins intersection weredeemed amportant by both the readers uggests thatthey may, an fact, be the most irnportant paragraphsm the arucle We compute the percentage of theseparagraphs that ~s included an the automaue xtract4 Umon We also calculate the percentage of auto-maucally selected paragraphs that as selected by atleast one of the two users Tins as, an some sense, aprecasmn measure, since at provades us wah a senseof how often an automatically selected paragraph ~spotenually amportantIn our experimentation, we observed that many sub-jects tend to select paragraph 3 an the summaries Tinsas because tins paragraph is the first content paragraph anan amcle and tends to be a chctionary-style d fimtion forthe amcle For example, for arUcle 15930 (Monopoly),tins paragraph readsMonopoly, economic snuauon in winch there asonly a single seller or producer of a eommochtyor a servace For a monopoly to be effective,there must be no prazucal subsututes for theproduct or servace sold, and no serious threatof the ency of a competitor into the market'Flus enables the seller to control the pnceSuch &cUonary-style definmons are generally hked byreaders and thus are usually included m a summary byour subjectsIn general, an written texts, the first content paragraphtends to be an introductory paragraph and ~s a good start-mg paragraph for summargauon For the encyclopechaamcles, we use tins reformation and we always includeparagraph 3 m the bushy and the depth-first summaries"Flus paragraph might be nussed by the segmented bushypaths but Is recaptured by the augmented segmentedbushy paths In case such collection specific mfonna-uon as not avadable, we use the first paragraph wath a?

the method's viablhty for generating good extracts, incethe scheme performs as well as a humanAbout 47% of the paragraphs deemed important byboth users are included m the bushy extract for an amcleThis figure ms somewhat dlsbeartemng We expected abetter coverage of these vital paragraphs by our extractsA further study of these paragraphs nught reveal somepropemes that users look for in a paragraph to decideits importance It might then be possible to automatethis selection process We also ldenufied the aruclesfor which the intersection of the two user summariesis a single paragraph For 78% of these amcles, thisparagraph was included in the bushy pathSegmented bushy paths perform worse than expectedTills Is because the first paragraph of an artacle Is veryoften selected by users, and segmented bushy paths oc-casronally omit flus paragraaph Tins results m a decreasem the overlap between automauc and manual extractsIn contrast, the other paths are guaranteed to includethe first paragraph, and perform better But, in general,the performance of segmented bushy paths was saus-factory (45 48% overlap with the user in the opunusucmethod) Smularly, the performance of the depth-firstpath was also sausfactory All paths aclueved the tram-mum reqtmement of perfonmng significantly better thana random extractBut more lnteresUngly, we observe that extracts pro-duced by selecting the first few paragraphs of the amclesalso performed comparably tothe best paragraph extrac-Uon scheme Adrmttedly, our evaluation methodologylacks the evaluaUon of the readabdlty aspect of a sum-mary wluch was one of the mmn mouvauons ofmovingfrom a sentence-based extracuon strategy to paragraph-based extracUon With very high chances, the lead sum-mary roll outperform all other automauc summaries mterms of readabthty We beheve this because automaucsummaries are a forced concatenauon f paragraphs &s-tnbuted all across a document, whereas alead summaryIs a mcely coherent sequence of paragraphs, as wnttenby the author Overall, the lead summanes are compa-rable to the best summanzauon strategy and could bemore readable than allother summaries Tlus troth israther discouraging for the feasthlhty of automauc sum-manzauon by text extracUon but agrees wlth the obser-vauons m (Brandow et al 1995) News reports, usedm (Brandow et al 1995), frequently contmn a leadingparagraph t at summanzes the story contmned inthe restof the report Likewise, m the encyclope&a amcles usedm flus study, the first paragraphs u ually define the topic,and provide ageneral outline about ItTo sum up?
The goocl news is that Interpreted mlight of the factthat he overlap between the two manual extracts i ,on an average, 46%, and given the enormous reduc-uon m the amount of resources reqmred 4,our resultsindicate that automauc methods for extracuon com-pare very favorably with manual extracUon?
But the bad news ms that a summary formed byextracung the mltmi paragraphs of an arUcle IS asgood as the best automatic summary and might justbe more readable from a user's perspective Tinsbnngs into question the overall uUhty of automatictext summanzatmn bytext (sentence or paragraph)extracUon -It ms possible that the nature of the articles used mthls study (encyclope&a amcles) and m (Brandow et al1995) (news articles) have a structure that yields verygood summanes, tmply by extracting the initial part ofan ar~cle It wdl be interesting to see lfobservattons fromflus study and from (Brand0w et al 1995) carry over toother, more non-encyclopedia likeand non-news like do-mmns (for example legal documents or U S Patents)In our stu&es with text summanzauon (by text extrac-uon), we have always felt a very strong need for a goodevaluauon test-bed Lack of good objecuve valuauontechniques for text summanzauon has always been thebiggest problem in all our work, an~ has consistently4The system took about 15 nunutes to generate 3 summariesfor each of 50 amcles A human would reqmre about 10 nunutesto produce a summary for a typical amcle from tlus set45&scouraged more expenmentaUon and exploration of m-teresung research posslbihlaes 0tke the one menuonedabove regardmg amcles from other domains)5 ConclusionIn tlus study, we have tried to evaluate automattc sum-manzaUon methods proposed earlier If a good testbedfor evaluaUng summaries were available, the evalualaonmethodology adopted m this study could be improved,but we believe it is the best we can currently do Under.our evaluation scheme, the four extraclaon algorithmsexanuned perform comparably, but they produced sigmf-lcantly better extracts than a random selection of para-graphs The absolute performance figures are not/ugh,but given the low overlap between two human-generatedextracts, they are enunenfly satisfactory However, thiswide vanatton between users brings us to the question ofwhether summanzauon byautomauc extracuon is feasi-ble If humans are unable to agree on wluch paragraphsbest represent an amcle, it is unreasonable to expect anautomauc procedure to identify the best extract, what-ever that might be We also find that presenting the userwith the lmUal part of an arucle is as good as emploYingany "mtelhgent" ext extraction scheme In summary,automauc summanzauon by extractuon is admtttedly animperfect method However, at the moment, itdoes ap-pear to be the only domain-independent t chnique whichperforms reasonablyAcknowledgmentsWe are deeply indebted to (late) Professor Gerard Saltonfor all hts guidance during the lineal stages of this workWithout he invaluable advice and support of ProfessorSalton, this work would not have been possible?
