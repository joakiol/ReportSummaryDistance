An abstract for the book follows.ABSTRACTThis study presents an original and penetrat-ing analysis of the complex problems surround-ing the automatic generaton of natural languagetext.
Laurence Danlos provides a valuable criti-cal review of current research in this importantand increasingly active field, and goes on todescribe a new theoretical model that isthoroughly grounded in linguistic principles.The model emphasizes the semantic, syntac-tic and lexical constraints that must be dealtwith when establishing a relationship betweenmeaning and form, and it is consideration ofsuch linguistic constraints that determinesDanlos' generation algorithm.
The book con-cludes with a description of a generation systembased on this algorithm which produces texts inseveral domains and also a system for the syn-thesis of spoken messages from semanticrepresentations.The book is a significant addition to theliterature on text generation~ and will be of par-ticular interest to all computational linguistsand AI researchers who have wrestled with theproblem of vocabulary selection.
