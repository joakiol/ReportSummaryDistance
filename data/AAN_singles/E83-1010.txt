EXTENDED ACCESS TO THE LEFT CONTEXT IN AN ATN PARSERIrlna Prodanof and Giaeomo FerrariIstltuto di Linguistica ComputazionaleVia della Faggiola 321-56100 Pisa, ItalyABSTRACTSome Italian sentences related to linguisticphenomena largely known and recently discussed bymany computational linguists are discussed in theframework of AT:~.
They offer certain difficultieswhich seem to suggest a substantial revision ofthe ATN formalism.
The theoretical assumptions andan experimental implementation of such a revisionare presented, together with examples.
}:anyrelated theoretical points such as somepsyeholinguistic implications and the relationshipbetween deterministic and non-deterministlchypothesis are also briefly discussed.I.
INTRODUCTIONCertain types of sentences seem to defy theabilities of several parsers, and some of them arebeing now discussed by many computationallinguists, mostly within the deterministichypothesis.An exmaination of their treatment within thetraditional AT\[: paradigm seems to suggest that thereal discussion is about how to acces the leftcontext and what its form should be.II.
ACCESS TO T}\]E LEFT COfJTEXToccurs, the parsing algorith~ suspends the currentcomputation and starts a new level of computation.Usually, each network recognizes some linguisticunit such as Noun Phrase (NP), PrepositionalPhrase (PP), and Sentence (S) and any recursivelyembedded call to one of them corresponds to alevel of computation.The parsed parts of the input string arestored (SETRed) into registers as they arerecognized.
At the end of the network theseregisters are combined (BUILDQed) into a parsenode and returned (POPed) to the calling net.Appropriate functions can return the content of aregister (GETR) or transfer it to another register(combination of SETR with a GETR).
This lastoperation is equivalent to i) the renaming of aregister, if the source register is successivelyset to a different value, i i )  the initializationof a register at a lower or higher level, if SENDRor LIFTR are used.Initialization is co~aonly used to i) raiselexical features to a higher level where they areused for tests (ex.
: subject-verb agreement), ii)pass possible antecedents to lower levels where agap may be detected in an embedded clause.B.
Difficult access to registersi.
Filler-gap linkingThe antecedent passingtheoretically unlimited increaseBy the standard procedure, them~biguous sentence(1)may cause ain storage load.analysis of the(I) Giovanni disse che aveva mentitoJohn said that (he) had liedA.
ATN Grammars "Giovanni" is always SENDRed as possible SUBJectof a complement, as soon as "disse" is recognizedAn ATN grammar is a set of networks formed by as an STF~ENS verb.
As no subject NP is met afterlabelled states and directed arcs connecting them.
"che', an interpretation is yielded withThe arcs can rlco~nize terminal (words) and "Giovanni" in subject position.
The secondnon-temnlnal (lexical cateF, ories) s~anbols or interpretation is produced si,,ply by successivelyreeursively call for a network identified by the setting the SULqJ register to a d~;~my node, whichlabel of an initial state.
When such a call(i) The ambiguity of this sentence is the sa1:~e as its English translation where "he" can be bouud eitherto "John" or to soueone else ,~eutioned in a previous sentence.
Italian has a gap instead of a pronoun.58remains unfilled.
The same treatment isrecursively applied to sentences llke(2) Giovanni pensava che avrebbe raccontatoJohn thought that (he) would have tolda tutti che aveva fatto unato everybody that (he) had done ascopertadiscoverywhere "Giovanni" must serve as subject of both thefirst and the second (linearly) complement.Instead, in the sentence(3) Giovanni dlsse che i suol colleghl avevanoJohn said that his colleagues hadmentitolied2.
Lexieal features raisingA storage overload may also be caused by theneed for raising lexieal features.
~orphologicalfeatures are necessary at the least in the test ofsubject-verb agreement.
This is done by LIFTRIngin ad hoe registers gender and number from the NPlevel to the S level.
If the :;P is popped in apossible subject position the test for agreementmay take place by comparing the content of thoseregisters with the corresponding features of theverb.
However, there are cases such as ex.
(1) inwhich such information must be used again in thecourse of the analysis for another (agreement)test.
Those features must be~ therefore, copiedin appropriately labelled registers in order to i)flag their relation to the subject and ii) preventtheln from being erased when the s~ne features areLIFTRed from the following NP.as the ~:P "i suoi colle~;hi" is analysed, itreplaces the SENDRed "Giovanni" in the SUBJregister and the correct interpretation is popped.The same need for ad boc storing may be shownfor the object and few PP complements.
Forexample, in the sentenceA more complex treatuent is required for thesentence(4) Giovanni pensava che i suoi colleghi avrebberoJohn thought that his colleagues wouldraccontato a tutti che aveva fattohave told to everybody that (|.e) had doneuna scoper taa discoverywhere "Giovanni" must get through the firstcomplement and reappear in the second (embedded)one.
If SENDR is used, a transit re~ister RI withthe same content as the initialized SUBJ registeris to be passed down together with it.
When thesubject of the first complement ('i suoicolleghi') is found, it replaces "Giovanni" inSUEJ but not in RI.
The new SUBJ "i suoicolleghi" and RI "Giovanni" are again SENDRed tothe embedded complement where the agreement withthe verb correctly selects, as subject, thecontent of RI.
l~ow, as the number of levels whichto "jump over" is in principle illlmited and eachone uay have its own subject to be SENDRed, atra~Isit register for each new subject is needed.Thus, for the sentence(5) Giovanni era sicuro che i suoi ner,lciavrebbero rivelato alla stamps che sua moglieavers detto un ;~iorno che l'aveva picchiata(2)(6) Ii capitano disse ai soldati cheThe captain said to the soldiers thatmarciavano pietosamente(they) were marching peatifullyas the t!P "i soldati" embedded in the "a-PP" isthe subject of the complement, its gender andnu~iber must travel up through PP and S and down tothe complement, in order the subject-verbagreement to be satisfied.
This implies that at agiven moment other registers containingmorphological features coexist at the S level withthose of the subject.An obvious remedy to this proliferation ofregisters consists in adding these features to tiletiP or PP structure, POPing them, and extractingthem from those structures when needed.
Butclassical ATN does not provide a suitablefunction, a form that should return only a partof a stored tree after having searched through it.Now, although such functions are not particularlycomplex to design \[5, 7\], they are not perfectlyconsistent with the ATe( general formalism whichdoes not take into consideration the extraction ofpieces of already processed information from thestructure they have Deen inserted in.C.
A functional perspectivewhen ?recessing< the last corn ple~,~ent threere:~isters contaizling the three possible subjectswill be available and shall be visited in order tofind the ri~iht one(3).i.
A generalized retrieving actionIf we look at the discussed exa,,;ples free anentirely functional viewpoint ~Je can describe themas having in common the need for retrieving(2) *John was sure that his enne~,ies would have disclosed to the press that his wife had once told tha't(he) ha.:!
bested her*.
~,'e give here, for clarity, the parenthesized form of this exmuple:(Giovanni era sicuro (che i suol nemlei avrebbero rlvelato alia stamps (ehe sua moglie aveva detto unglorno (che l*aveva picchiata))).I!otice that in this example the subject-verb agreement is sufficient to select the right antecedent, butt|'is is not always the case.
(3) A possible alternative, equally trlcky,is the use of the HOLD-VIRT couple.59information somewhere back in the already builtstructures; the tricky solutions presented aboveare, in fact, a way of accessing parts of the leftcontext.
These sometimes correspond to the entirecontent of a register and sometimes to a fragmentof it.We will assume, then, that the left context isstored in a space o f  memory, equally accessiblefrom any level and that retrieving always concernsfragments of it.
At any point of the process thisstructure contains the current hypothesis aboutthe analysis of the parsed segment of the inputfrom the beginning; hence we will refer to it asCurrent Global Hypothesis (CGH).The retrieving action will have two participants,a symbol that triggers the action (trig?er) andthe infomnation to be retrieved (the target of theaction).In this frame all the different proceduresdiscussed above may be reduced to a single generalalgorithm of three steps,i) identification of a t r l~er  (a gap to befilled, a verb uhich demands for the subject-verbagreement test)ii) extraction of constraints which ::~ust guide thesearch for the target, andiii) retrieving of the required inforuation.On this functional ground, the samedescription fits to the binding of an anaphoricpronoun to its antecedent \[7\] as in(7) a) Giovanni disse a harla che volevaJohn said to .~ary that (he) wantedsposarl-lamarry heras opposed tob) Giovanni dlsse a llaria che volevaJohn said to ~!ary that (he) ~lantedsposarsito marryThe function that searches back may beconstrsined by several types of restrlctlons,includin~ i) morphological features, i.e.
thegender and number of the pronoun or those requiredfor agreement by the syntactic environment (e.g.the verb), ll) syntactic idiosyncrasies of souelexical Ite~:~ such as the STRA~S verbs thatdetermine which of their arguments is to be thesubject of the couplement, ill) seLlautic featuresthat may be introduced in the process, and iv)syntactic deter,-.inat ion of the scope of thesearch.2.
.
!anipulations of the left contextI\[et rieving of the antecedent nay actuallycorrespond to two different operations dependingupon ~hether the antecedent to be bound li~Learlypreceeds or follows the syubol it is to be boundto.In the cases discussed abovu the gap or thepronoun always follow there antecedent and it istherefore possible to i~ ,:~edia tel y insert thebinding pointer.
\[\[oreover, in many comon sentencesthe antecedent linearly follows its dependent, asin(8)(9)Quando si arrabbia, Giovanni diventa rossoWhen (he) gets angry, John becomes redSe io vedi, saluta GiovanniIf (you) see him, say hallo to Johnda parte miaon my behalfIn this case, the binding should take place intwo steps, the flagging of the need for a forwardbinding and the moving of the pointer from theantecedent, once detected, to the flag.
Noticethat this class of sentences entirely lies beyondthe abilities of the classical ATi~ framework.Relative pronouns also need to be bound to anantecedent and, besides, are the surface signal ofan embedding.
~:o special processing difficulty isproposed by sentences like(i0) Ii ra~azzo ehe correThe boy who runswhere the relative pronoun occurs exactly ~herethe embedding begins.
In this case a scoperestriction can limit the search for an antecedentto the imI.~ediately preceeding \[~P.But in the sentences(ii) II ragazzo del quale ti parlmvoThe boy about whom I was talkin3 to you(12) Ii ragazzo del cui padre ti parlavoThe boy about whose fati~er I uas talkingto youthe relative clause boundery is set one wordbefore the relative pronoun, and in(13) Ii ragazzo del padre del qualeThe boy about the father of whom:ti parlavowas talking to youwhere the phenomenon known as pied-plping occurs,such a boundery may be located several wordsbefore the relative pronoun.In an AT!~ these cases ~:eet the initial set ofarcs ~hich recognize a PP e~,bedded iu an NP, as iu(14) il ragazzo dell'nscensoret~e boy of the liftanti the correct interpretatiot~ is obtained only bybacktracking (for ii and 12) aad again usinb a setof transit registers (for \]2).
~o solution isknown for sentence (13).In the frame~'ork we have been discussin,~ anaction ~Jhich structurally ~iodifies the leftcontext can be proposed.

EXPF.~ I~IE,~TAL I~d'LEF,'ENTATIO;IA.
General assumptions\[~ost of the above discussion is based on ourown experience with an ATN parser, although validalso for other parsers.
Some of the linguisticphenomena we are trying to functionally classifyhave been recently discussed in the frame of thedetenainistic parsing and sou, e progress in thetreatment of those sentences has been done.However ~Je prefer to stick to thenon-deten:~inistic hypothesis, because no valuablear~;ument seems to stand against ti~e idea of AT~ asa collection of alternative heuristic strateEiesrepresenting those used in the human sentenceprocessing.
On the contrary it is possible tointroduce in an ATN parser some mechanism forselecting strategies in function of a text or asublangua;~e \[Ii\].Our assumption is, then, that the possibilityof backtracking must be kept, but restricted byi.
introducing linsuistic coDstraints to guide thechoice of alternatives;ii.
manipulating the left context in some cases inwhich backtracking can be intuitively charged oninadequacies of the parser rather than on pointsof real linguistic ambiguity.A second assumption more related to thecurrent implementation of the system refers to thegrammatical fomnalisn.
A functional representationa la \['..Kay \[i~\] is used.
A detailed explanationof this fonaalis:~ is not necessary to theunderstanding of this paper.
It is enough to knowthat its \];asic unit is the attribute-value pair,wk,ere an attribute is a symbol (label) and a valueis a symbol or another functional description.
Inthe sentence(15) l le killed hera possible pair is SUEJ=he, or SUBJ=HEAD=hetogether with SUBJ=CAT=PRON etc.
Any sequence ofsy~nbols is a path leading to a value; thus thevalue of SUI;J=:IEAD is "he'.The functions that access the data structureare specifically desi.~;ned to treat this type ofrepresentation but ~.,e think that they could beeasily Feneralizcd.
The ter-n "component" will beused to identify the get of paths startin;; fro,~the sa:ae lal;el (radix).The reasons of this choice are as follows:i. addressim: frabments of information is moreeasily done by follo~,In~: a path of labels than byvisiting; a unlabellcd tree;ii.
functional grammar allows any depth oflinguistic representatiou through the leftadjunction of labels;iii.
functional syntactic repeseutation andlexical features (also expressed in tenas ofattribute- value pairs) ;~ay be treated in auniform way.B.
The parserThe basic features of the ATN :~,arser used inour previous experi~aents \[19\], i.e.
the networkformalism and the parsing algoritl~a, are kept,while the data structure and the whole set ofactions and forms have been modified.
Also the useof the push-down mechanisn~ has been ,modified tosome extent.The data structure is a list which is mainlyaccessed wittl a typical LIFO stack policy.
Itrepresents a unique memory space non splitted intoregisters.
The state saving mechanism necessaryfor the treatraent of non-detenainism is providedby XD-LISP \[2,17\], the dialect of LISP in whichthe system is written.
At any point in whichnon-determinism is called, the previous context,in particular the data, is saved and only the newvalues are set in the current context.
Therefore,there is no difference between the use of thetraditional register table and this special listsince both of them are handled in the same way.This (LIFO) list contains at any point of theprocess the CGI', i.e.
the entire left contextliterally represented in ten,~s of attribute-valuepairs.We give hereafter a llst in Backus notation of thefunctions which access the CCH.I .Actionsa.

which is usedto store any iucor,ing piece of structure.
Thestring(16) il canethe dogrecognized by ti,e network61is stored by the following actionsI.
(AI.D (DET *))2.
(ADD (P.EAD *))If location is NIL, the  current co(,~ponent ismeant, otherwise the form LOCATE specifies thepath leading to the radix to which the new \[,air isto be ADDed.Pelabelling of a component is done by the actionASSIGNS.
In the sentences(16a) Ii cane u:any, iathe doz eats(-16b) Ii cane e ?
mangiatothe dot~ is eatenthe NP "il cane" will be first labelled FOCUS orFIIISTXP.
Then, after having rico?,nized the verb,the action(ASSIC~!

LOCATE worksexactly in the same way, but returns a pointer toa Liven radix.
All the three functions can work indifferent modes.
They can search either only thecurrent level (CL) or throu;,h the entire list (T).In this latter case the current level is excludedand, if no further options are specified, thelower (the nearest to the top) occurrence isreturned.
Another option (dtype) returns all theoccurrences either appen,}ed in a list (L) or one"y one, non-deter:,inistieally (UD).

Such an ?\[P mustagree in nuanber and gender with the current levelhead, i?e.
the verb(4).
If this expression isembedded in the function(ADD SUBJ )the correct subject(s) is (are) cOpiEd in thecompleuent (5).The three last actions, PUSI!, POP, and I:~S\]:'.P,T,manipulate the items in the list.
PUSX adds a nee(empty) ite:,t in front of the list.
The elements ofthe co~ponent being analysed (phrases orsentences) are ADDed it~ this top item, which hasbeen therefore referred to as current level.
POPre.coves the current top-ite+~ and e.:beds it intothe ne~?

Finally li!Si2~Tinserts an itei,, cor respond in  to ~: nu:: level,so+mubere back between "ite+a" an:!

Thus a eo+aponent can bePOPed after the end of its recognition procedure,wben also its function is clarified.The are recognizing an object, for ex., can beexpressed as follows(START NP T(COND (FI::I?+ (SITBj) T CL T)(POP OBJ))(TO qi))which means that if there already is a subject,the current couponent must be popped with thelabel OBJ.The use of the IESERT function is primarilymotivated by the treatment of certain relativeclauses.
Felative pronouns arc surface sijnalsthat tridger the embedding into ~, relativ~ clau~eof tim currently processed co.+q,oncnt(s).In the sentenc?~(17)11 libro della tra;,,a del quale i,arlava:to\['he book about The plot of whici ve tal,:e,1such an e,:~bedding take~ ',lace L.,:c~iatel~.'

A slizhtly modified version of this function ni;;itt produce theinsertion of the antecedent path, as in the orthodox functional grat~\[,,ar.
The proccduL'e, ho~Jever, does llotsubstantially chanzc.62(Ig) (il libro (RELCL (della trams (del quale))parlavamo))The general rule may be formulated as follows:"a new level labelled ~ELATIVECb\USE is to beinserted immediately after the antecedent of therelative prottoun'.
Analysis of (17) will thereforeproceed as follows; ?- when the relative pronoun "quale" isencountered, the for;n(FIND (HEAD) (AND (Et\] (FINDVAL (HEAD GEN) T T ~:D)(FINDVAL (DET GEN) T CL T))(EQ (FINDVAL (HEAD N~)  r T ND)(FINDVAL (bET N~)  r CL T)))T T)no substantial difference exists in comparisonwith the traditional register access.
In thediscussed complex cases the access to the CGII is aknown function of the length of the list, i.e.
ofthe depth of embedding of tlle current level.Within any item search proceeds linearly as forany ordinary pattern-matching.The only substantially ne~ fact is thepossibility of embedding the current component;this eliminates the need for backtracking, atleast for some sentences.In conclusion, it seems that if there is adifference from the traditional ATN it is infavour of the version presented here.returns the lower head ~hich agrees in number andgender with the determiner of "quale" ('quale" isboth masculine and feminine), i.e.
"llbro'.
Thisis the antecedent.- The function(liggEtT ~ELCL (LOCATE...as for FIND))inserts a new ite~+t with label :~.ELCL.- On the saree arc the function (POP DI-AI~G) embeds"del quale" in "della trams" and a second POPembeds (della tra,~a (del quale)) in the recentlyinserted relative clause co~:~ponent.- The recognition of a relative clause iscontinued by a (STA;~.T S .... ) arc.
The control isfinally then returned to the I,~P process with thecon'.plex I~'V "il libro...'as the current component.B.
Generalization and modularityThe set of actions and forr~s presented seem toprovide a functional descril;tion of manylinguistic pheno~nena.
They can be regarded aslinguistic (procedural) generalizations, at leaston the functional y~round.
This supports our claimthat linguistic pheno~:~ena can be described,in~lepen~ently fro~ tbc fon;~alisu that expressesthem ( the grammar), in ter~.is of generaloperations.
This set of operations is open- endedand can, therefore, be increased with functionsdesigned for the treatment of new phenomena, asthey are discussed and described.
Furthermore,those actions can be taken to represent nlentaloperations of the language user, thus providing avaluable frame for psycLolinguistic experiments.IV.
ADVA~:TAGESA.
EfficiencyThe parser we have been presenting is based onthe core algorithm of the AT~J.
Our modificationsaffect the set of for, us and actions and the datastructure.
The parsin~ algorithu~, therefore, keepsthe efficiency of traditional ATE.
We have alreadyshown that the storing of the data structure doesnot present any special difference from thetraditional re:~isters syste~, even in relation tothe treatL~ent of non-determini~l.
The r,:emory loadis.
therefore, strictly a function of tile lengthof the parsed se:_,L::ent of the input an(\] no overheaddetermined by t~anipulations of structures is addedas in the case of transit registers.The actiol~s an,!
fom~s are equivalent to thetra~?itional ones, but for the fact that \[~ost oftile.., :Lust visit the t~holc left context for everyaccess.
~.~y:;ay this effec~ hardly l,alances thes~tting of transit re~,+isters.
In fact, it is~;or th noting: that in the ~lajority of comrlonsentences such accesses are very reduced, go thatIt is obvious that this view strongly inclinestowards the idea of parser as a collection ofheuristic strategies and processes and also offersa aye,|metric alternative to the HOLD hypothesis.According to thls hypothesis there are points in asentence in which comprehension needs a heaviermemory load; instead in our view an overhead ofoperations is suggested.
Anyway the distinguishedphenomena coincide, thus keeping the inte~rity ofthe experimental data(6).C.
NaturalltyOur hypothesis seems more natural in t~.,o ~Jays.It embeds into a non-detemninistic frame so~+eoperations very similar to some of those designedand discussed in the deterlnini.
'~tlc hypotilesis \[3,4, 15, 16, 19\].
The result is a strong limitationof the effects of non-determinism, at least forthose cases they are desigue~t to treat.
It isinteresting that starting from two opposedviewpoints co~aparable resul t'~ are obtaine~t.i~evertheless, as stated above, we tt~ink thatimposing constraints to a non-deterministic :,:odelis ::io re natural than being: imposed ~ lobalconstraints by the assu~q)tiou of ti~termiuism.
Irtthe first hypothesis, in fact, a deter~inisticbehaviour of the ~,arser ;~a~ ~e ulti; ~ately(u) In this t)aragra;,h we refer to the ideas and the experiments presentec by Kaplan \[12, 13\] and IJanner &::arm|sos \[21\].63obtained, in som~ points, as a result ofobservation of real linguistic restrictions while~h~e phenomena such as amhlgulty which can beadequately treated only in a non-de?er~inisticframe, are not "a priori" ruled out.
Then, amodel such as the non-detem~inistic one, in whichthere is place for the study of human heuristicconstraints, seems more attractive and natural.Our hypothesis seems intuitively natural alsoin so much as it tries to propose a "theory ofguess ~.
During the comprehension of a sentenceguesses (CGII's) are progressively enriched andstored in a space of memory.
During this processerrors may he done.
For some of them it is enoughto ,aodify the previous guess while for others areal backtracking and reanalysis is necessary.Although the distinction between the two types oferrors is unclear, it provides a valuable framefor further research in the domain ofcomputational linguistics as well aspsycholinguisties.
In \[>articular it seems todistim3uish in the activity of sentencecomprehension a phase of structuring from a phaseof perception.
Errors occurring in t~,e former areremedied by ~nodifyin~ a guess, while thoseoccurring in the latter need baektrackin~ and thechoice of another strategy.V ?
PERSPECTIVESA more serious systematization of the proposedfunctions, as well as the extension of the modelto ~ore and more llnguistic phenomena are obviousextensions of the present project.Another direction where investigation seems tobe particularly fruitfull is the relation betweensyntax and ser.:antics.
On one hand, the fact thatthe result of the analysis is progressively storedin a unique space of uemory :lo not it:pose specialconstraints on the structure of the analyzedstrin~.
On the other hand, many of the presentedfunctions include parameter slots for conditionswhich may be filled with any kind of test.
Thist~odel see:qs, therefore, to avoid "physiological"bounderies between syntax and semantics.
Thestored structure can be a semantic one and thetests can also incorporate se~;.antic descriptions.This seems to eventually lead to an easierintegration of the two levels, h~e will presentshortly \[i0\] a first approxi~.ation to a frame intowhich such in inte~ration can be realized.AII,'IO',.
