jpINTRODUCTIONTesniAre's attention to covering a maximal num-ber of syntactic phenomena explains the im-pressive number of languages - "timco hominemunius linguae" - cited in the El~raents de syn-taxe structurale.
Although Japanese is correctlyclassified as a strongly centripetal language ac-cording to linear survey (relevd lin~aire, p. 33),no examples of Japanese are cited.
Conse-quentl); we have endeavored to apply Tesni~re'sideas to Japanese by manually constructing thelinguistic structures for more than six thousandsentences of a corpus of hotel reservation con-versations.In fact, Tesni~re's grammatical ideas, andamong them, the most original ones, fit well toJapanese as they give simple and insightful de-scriptions of some usually controversial gram-matical phenomena (ergative constructions, na-adjectives).After describing the different ypes and cate-gories of words, we will focus on the three phe-nomena to which, according to Tesni~re, all syn-tactical phenomena reduce: connection, junc-tion and transference.
From the representa-tional point of view, we will introduce corre-spondence intervals to code which part of thesurface text corresponds to which nodes or sub-trees.1 WORDSWe have taken the character (kana or kanji),which is the physical unit of a Japanese text, asthe unit of measure of the length of a section oftext.
With the convention of starting at posi-tion O, we locate any piece of text, and hencewords, using an interval notation.
Note thatthere is no word separator (or blank spaces) inJapanese.
In the following sentence 1, the wordt~m is located by the interval \[3_5\] and the word~.
'C  by \[6.9\].
This notation will be used incorrespondences (Section 2.2).11 ~ 12 ~ 13oCould I get a room upstairs ?.1.1 Species and Categories of WordsThe differentiation between: content words,which are associated with a concept, and func-tion words, which express yntactical informa-tion was not difficult to apply to Japanese.1.1.1 Content WordsSome examples of content words include :~.~(yoyaku, reservation), ~L~ (okureru, to belate), ~ (takai, expensive), ~ (tyokusetu,directly).
Tesni~re distinguishes between twocategories of content words: processes and sub-stances, which are, for explanation purposes,usually exemplified by verbs and nouns, respec-tively, in Indo-European languages.
This is alsoconsistent with Japanese.These two categories are in turn divided into:concrete and abstract categories, which opposesthe concrete notion of processes and substancesto their abstract attributes, and gives rise to thefollowing categorisation for content words (seealso (Starosta 88), Tesni~re's notations is shownin capitals).concreteabstractsubstmlces processessubstantive verbalO !adjectival adverbialA El Except when mentioned, examples axe from tile tree-baak.109It is to be noted that, in the case of Japanese,two categories of words are variable in relationto aspect and negation: abstract substances(A) and concrete processes (I), which are re-spectively (i-)adjectives and verbs in terms ofJapanese grammars.Now, some classes of words, which pose prob-lems in Japanese grammar books written in En-gush, such as the so-called na-adjectives (W~"(sizuka, quiet)), and the Sino-Japanese nouns-verbs formed in conjunction with use of theJapanese verb -J-70 (suru, to do), can easilybe categorised as nouns (O).
This is consistentwith w'hat is taught in Japanese schools, (seeAppendix B), their syntactical behaviour be-ing prefectly described by transference (see Sec-tion 4).1.1.2 Funct ion  WordsGrammatical tools, the role of which is to ei-ther make explicit, or change the category of acontent word, or to define relationships betweenwords, are called function words.
These wordswill appear in eztenso in structural representa-tions.In Japanese, many can be easily identified,such as, 7~ (ga, t~ ,  nominative case post?particule), 69 (no, J~{~'J, genitive case post-particle), 69"~ (node, ~ l~ ' J ,  equivalent tosubordinate conjunction), 7)~ (ka, ~ .~,  end ofinterrogative sentence particle), 3"70 (suru, +)""~B~, support verb for Sino-Japanese nouns),etc.Of course, some function words can also becontent words in a different context.
For in-stance, the verb "J-70 (suru), is either the sup-port verb for Sino-Japanese nouns, (a functionword in that case), or the verb "to do" (a con-tent word).2 CONNECTIONTesni~re speaks of connection to describe the re-lations between words in a sentence in terms oftheir subordination relations.
This concept in-cludes predicate-argument or governor-modifierrelations as w-eU as predicate-circumstantial re-lations (Eldments, p. 14).The study of sentences, which is theproper object of structural syntaz is es-sentially the study of its structure, i.e.the hierarchy of its connections.2.1 Tree Representat ion:  S temmasTesni~re was the first to propose, in 1934,to systematically use graphical representations 2which he called sternmas, for representing thishierarchy (Tesni~re 34).
However, these stem-mas were more than simple trees.
Although,we will show that the introduction of correspon-dence makes it possible to encode Tesni~re's rep-resentations u ing just trees.Basic connections are those which link con-crete notions with their abstract attributes(Figure 1).yasui hoteru hayakucheap hotel quicklytukimasuarriveFigure 1: Basic connections.By replacing content words with their class(O, I, A, E) "virtual" stemmas (on the right)can be derived from the "real" ones (on the left).2.2 CorrespondencesTo explicitly indicate which word, or morespecifically, especially in the case of Japanese,which chunk of text corresponds to which nodein the stemma, we adopted the use of correspon-dences (Boitet and Zaharin 88).We note two kinds of correspondence:?
words-to-node, and?
sentence parts-to-completesubstring-to-subtree.subtree, orConstra ints  Correspondences are noted byintervals, as introduced above, and are governedby three constraints (Lepage 94).?
global correspondence:  an entire treecorresponds to an entire sentence;2He acknowledged that two Russian linguists usedtrees in 1930 to explain some syntactic phenomenon, but,unlike Tesni~re, the use of trees was not pivotal in theirexplanations.110IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII?
inclusion: a subtree which is part of an-other subtree T, must correspond to a sub-string in the substring corresponding to T;?
membersh ip :  a node in a subtree T, mustcorrespond to words members of the sub-string corresponding to T.I12 ta0 00_2/0..2 3_6/3_6o~2tyousyoku:breakfast'narimasu:become't:t 3 Y~U~" e t: rha beturyoukin niTOP 'extra charge' LOCBreakfast is not inchtded.Figure 2: A sentence and its associated stemma.In Figure 2, on each node of the stemma,two intervals tand for the words-node and thesubstring-subtree correspondences, in that or-der.
The entire sentence 3 extends from 0 to 11,as indicated by the root.
This root is a verb, de-noted as I, and is located in position 7 to 11: f.?19 ~ 3"- (narimasu).
Similarly, the node labelledt: (hi) corresponds as a word to the case-maker~:, which extends from 6 to 7 in the sentence.The entire subtree dominated by the node cor-responds to the phrase ~ l J~:  (beturyoukinhi) which extends from 3 to 7.D iscont inuous  Interva ls  Discontinuous in-tervals are possible.
In Figure 3, the deverbativenoun ~b~ (negai, request) from ~li') (negau, toask for) takes an accusative argument extend-ing from 0 to 4, ~3~1~" (o+namae wo, your"~Refer to Table A in Appendix for notations used inglosses.111name).
Because the honorific prefix ~3 + (o+)can only be applied to a noun, obtained by at-taching the suffix + b~ (+i) (transference, seeSection 4), the subtree dominated by the ver-bal root corresponds to a non-connex substring\[0_4\]+\[5.6\] in the surface form: ~3~'k  .

This corresponds particularly wellwith our data because the free ordering of case-marked phrases (not words) is a property ofJapanese, which makes dependency grammarsmore adequate in its description 4.
For exam-4(Mel'~uk 88) and (Starv6ta 88), among others havealready commented that constituency structures areEnglish-oriented representations i to which some lin-guists try desperately to cast other languages.
An il-lustration is (Gunji 87).
After a ten-page discussion,and despite an honest acknowledgment that there is ab-solutely no basis for this, he draws the conclusion that apreferred position for the subject, as a left sister of thepie, the two following propositions are equallyvalid, where location and subject have been ex-changed.rokunin ga hitoheya ni ireru'6-people' NOM 'l-room' LOC 'can-enter'a room that can accommodate 6 people- -g~ ~z ~A ~hitoheya ni rokunin ga'l-room' LOC '6-people' NOML.
fL ;b .
.
.ireru...'can-enter'a room that can accommodate 6 peopleOmission Moreover, in Japanese, the omis-sion of any of the case-marked phrases is pos-sible.
One can perfectly imagine a situationwhere a traveler first announces that he is ina group of 6 people, and then merely utters thefollowing sentence:- -~  ~z X.~,~hitoheya ni ireru'one-room' LOC 'can-enter'a room that can accommodate 6 peopleThis sentence has no subject, and yet it is un-ambiguously understood as a request for a roomwhich can accommodate 6 people altogether.Ergat ive Const ruct ions  Moreover, thesearch for the "real subject", as opposed to thesyntactical subject, is meaningless in depen-dency representations of ergative constructions.Such constructions exist in Japanese 5 witha range of adjectives, such as, ~ L.~ ~ (hosii)(20  occurrences in our corpus), or verbalforms in -t~,~ (tai) (around 310 occurrencesin the corpus), or the so-calhd "passive" or"medio-passive" verbs, such as, gP.. 1o (mieru,c.f.
Fr.
se voir).verb, has to be postulated for Japanese, because.., it isso in English.5However, the ergative case does not exist inJapanese, and it would be difficult to call Japanese anergative language (see (Mel'euk 88), p. 250-253, for def-initions concerning ergativity).112~a0~ $~ ~b~,~ .

He shows that some clues indicatethat the subject links to the auxiliary, while theobject should be linked with the past participle.Similar analysis eems particularly well adaptedto some Japanese constructions too, not becauseof the agreement in gender-number, but becauseof case semantics.For instance, in the following sentence, thesubject, postal code, cannot be considered thesubject of the verb, to write ?.yuubinbangou ga kaite aru'postal code' NOM 'write' 'is'The postal code is written (e.g.
on an enve-lope)However, changing the auxiliary, ab~ (aru)into b~ 7o (iru) implies a change in the case ofpostal code.yuubinbangou wo kaite iru'postal code' ACC 'write' 'is'The postal code is being written (e.g.
by Lu-cien) - Somebody is writing the postal code.This convinced us to adopt Tesni~re's analy-sis, where the subject is linked with the auxil-iary (Figure 5).
?1~'~ (kaite) is a non-conclusive, pending, form ofthe verb 8 < (kaku), which is translated in English by"writing ~ or "written" according to the context.IIIII,IIIIIIITET ~3~ 8-1i/0-5+8-10I + ~ ~5_7/5.8 7.8/7.8 4.5/0.

Accordingly, we can easilyrepresent cap junctions as in Figure 6.ikkai to tikaikk~i ni'first-floor' 'and' 'basement floor' LOCOn the first and basement floorsFigure 6: A case of a cap junction.On the other hand, in cup cases, the same de-pendent shares everal governors.
A tree can be'~factored" by using a special node, V, bearing113the same correspondences as its root.

This is a signifi-cant difference to constituency representations,but conforms with Tesni~re's description (e.g.p.
649).
Figure 7 is such an example.4 TRANSFERENCETransference r, in essence, consists in transfer-ring to a content word of a given category thefunction or role of another category.
Accord-ing to Tesni~re, it is precisely this transferencewhich aUows a speaker of any language to neverbe stopped by the fact that a needed conceptdoes not fit, by category, into the role requiredat a given point in an utterance.Transferer  Transference applies to a contentword, called the transferee.
It is performed bya transferer, which may be:?
a function word 69 (no,  of) ,  ~:- (hi, to) ,  T(sum, to do), etc.7Here, we follow the recommendation of Tesni~re him-self to render the French word translation with this En-glish term especially coined for the meaning here.IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlsome morphological device ?
< (ku, adver-bial form of adjectives), ?
"C (re, pendingform of verbs), etc.no mark at all (the so-called "relatives" ofJapanese are in fact transferences: a verbis transferred into an adjective without anymarker).
In this case, we indicate the trans-ferer node by ?.As a result of transference, the category ofthe content word has been transformed into an-other category so that it can play the role of theresulting category.
For instance:,-k,,'Y-Jt~:O ~ ,~,-Y-Jp0):Ahoteru hoteru nohotel of the hotelRepresentat ion Depending on the positionof the transferer, left and right transferenceshave to be distinguished.
In Japanese, thetransferer is predominantly on the right of thetransferee.
We represent the transference withthe help of a 3-node subtree to render Tesni~re'scapital T notation:?
the mother node bears the target category,followed (or preceded) by T if the transfereris on the right of the transferee in the sen-tence, (usual case in Japanese), or on theleft.;?
the left (or right) daughter bears the trans-feree, represented by its category;?
the other daughter bears the transferer, ?e.the function word in extenso.A mother node does not correspond to anyword in the surface text so it bears an emptyinterval (denoted as \[n_n\], with any u).
How-ever, as the root of a subtree, it represents thesum of the intervals of all its subtrees.Na-Adjectlves A class of Sino-Japanesenouns exists in Japanese, extended in contem-poranean Japanese by a full range of English-Japanese nouns (Sells 96) (~- - -  ~' f,c (yuniiku-na.
unique), 7 I/.
:p -~ :~ fo?
(huressyu-na, fresh)),which could be semantically interpreted as ad-jectives, but follow a specific syntactical be-haviour, different from standard adjectives end-ing in ~ (i) (Appendix C).

We analysedt.c as a transferer of nouns (0) into adjectives(A).
This view meets that of (Kuwae 89), vol 1,p.
185, who considers that, "t~ (da) is the onlyvariable word in Japanese for which there existsa determinative form, t,c (ha), distinct from theconclusive form.
"CONCLUSIONWe have presented a tree-bank of 6553 sentencesof Japanese conversations in the domain of ho-tel reservations , which uses Tesni~re's structuralsyntax framework.
Correspondences betweensurface texts and trees are ensured by meansof intervals.It has long been felt in the NLP  Japanesecommunity that a dependency approach fitswell to the description of Japanese.
Theprivileged place for the subject in con-stituency descriptions generates artificial prob-lems, whereas, dependency allows simple anddirect description of phenomena like, for in-stance, ergative constructions.Moreover, Tesni~re's original ideas give aclear insight to some area.
For instance, theattachment of arguments under auxiliaries bet-ter renders case semantics.
Also, transferencepermits a simple analysis of "na-adjectives",which respects the feeling of native speakers ofJapanese.114ABGrammat ica l  Labels  Used inGlossessymbol particle orexampleTOP l;t (ha)NOM 7) t (ga)ACC ~ (wo)LOC ~: (ni)"~ (de)HON ~3 + (o+) honorific+ (go+)topicalisatioff"nominativeaccusativelocativeS t ructura l  Syntax  Categor ies  andJapanese  School  Grammar  Classessymbol class example0 ~ , ~-~t~ (~L~)nouns :~  (#~J )~"  (~$~)-t-~L;~9 * :,' (~$)adj.
