A (7f may \[mconm a. Ct, later871in the discourse.
The set of Cfs is ordered bytheir grammatical properties which are consideredto reflect their degrees of salience.
The centeringtheory specifies the following (heuristic) rule:If the Cb of the current sentence is thesame as the Cb of the previous sentence,a (zero) pronoun should be used.There are two versions of the centering theorythat have been applied to Japanese zero pronounresolution: Kameyama's(Kameyama, 1986) andWalker's(Walker et al, 1994).
Roughly both ver-sions use the following same forward center rank-ing for Japanese:Topic > Empathy > Subject > Object2> Object > Others,where Empathy is a grammatical property that in-dicates the speaker's position in describing a situ-ation.
In addition to the above rule, Kameyama'sversion uses the property sharing constraint hattwo zero pronouns in adjacent sentences, whichco-specify the same Cb, should share one of thegrammatical properties.
This constraint is usedfor ranking discourse ntities in the order of pref-erence as the antecedent of a zero pronoun.Walker's version, on the other hand, uses thefollowing additional rules and constraint:?
ConstraintFor each sentence Ui:The center, Cb(Ui), is the highest-ranked element of C I (\[7/-1) that ap-pears in Ui.?
RulesFor each sentence Ui:1.
If a certain element of C I (Ui-1) appearsas a (zero) pronoun in Ui, then so isCb(Ud.2.
Transition states are ordered, where thetransition state is determined based ontwo factors: whether Cb of the currentsentence is the same as of the previoussentence, and whether Cb is the sameas the highest-ranked member of C I ofthe current sentence.
This transition or-dering is used for ranking discourse en-tities in the order of preference as theantecedent of a zero pronoun.Basically, when the centering algorithm is usedfor the (zero) pronoun resolution, the algorithmfirst generates all possible antecedents for (zero)pronouns in a sentence by enumerating all possibleCt, and C\] pairs for the sentence, and then filtersand ranks these possible antecedents with the con-straint and rules that are mentioned above.
TheCb of the sentence is computed as the side effectof performing the (zero) pronoun resolution.3 P rocess ing  Complex  Sentenceswith the Centering TheoryIn the centering theory that we outlined in the lastsection, 'sentence', that is its basic unit of pro-cessing, means the simple sentence that containsonly one predicate(verb).
The centering theory,therefore, has not adequately addressed the wayto handle complex sentences that contain nmltiplcverbs.
However, it is necessary to handle complexsentences that are prevalent in naturally occurringdiscourses with the centering algorithms.We can think of (at least) two ways to handlecomplex sentences.
For instance, consider process-ing a complex sentence of the form 'SX Conj SY,'where SX and SY each consists of a simple sen-tence and Conj is a conjunctive lement(Suri andMcCoy, 1994) 1.
One can imagine processing SXfirst and then SY as if they are a linear sequence ofsimple sentences and applying the centering the-ory to each sentence successively and updating thedata structures for centering.On the other hand, the whole sentence can betreated as a single unit.
This approach, how-ever, has two problems.
First, the intrasenten-tial ellipsis that the antecedent exists in the samesentence 9 cannot be handled with the centeringtheory, because the centering theory only han-dles the intersentential e lipsis.
Therefore, the in-trasentential e lipsis must be dealt with separatelyfrom the intersentential e lipsis.
Secondly, in thecentering theory, it is unclear whether two zeropronouns with the same grammatical property inthe different simple sentences (of a complex sen-tence) can be simultaneously handled without anyextension to the original theory.Comparing these two approaches, we adopt theformer.
And if a sentence contains multiple verbs,we partition it into multiple simple sentences andapply the centering theory to a sequence of p~r-titioned simple sentences individually for the zeropronoun resolution.
Using this approach, we neednot modify the original centering algorithm dras-tically to handle complex senteimes.
Even the in-trasentential e lipsis can be handled with the cen-tering theory, because different simple sentencescontain the antecedent and the zero pronoun re-spectively, after partitioning.a.1 The  range  of search  for theantecedentSince the centering theory uses only the infor-nmtion in the previous and current sentences,this might be problematic when we adopt the'partition' approach.
\]ebr example, if the previ-ous sentence consists of three simple sentences,1In case of Japanese, it is a conjunctivepostposition.2Of course, the antecedent does not exist in thesame simple sentence.872tile firs(; simple sentence in tile previous seil-tence becomes tile third from the, current sen-tence, after partitioning.
Partitioning might causethat, the information in the previous and current(post-partitioned simple) sentences does not in-chide even tile information in the current (pre-partitioned) sentence.
We tilink it is inadequate,since the antecedents of zero pronouns often ap-pear in the previous (pre-partitioned) sentence.Therefore, it; is necessary to extend the range ofsearch for (;he antecedent to more previous (post-partitione.d simple) sentences.To determine to what extent we should extendthe range of search for the antecedent, we makethe following investigations and e.xperiment:?
How many simple sentences does a naturallyoccurring sentence consist of??
How many sentences from the current seil-tence do we find tim antecedent of a zero I)ro-noun in real discourses??
How does tile accuracy of tile zero pronounresolution change if we vary the range of sim-ple sentences where the antecedent of a zeropronoun is searched?The first investigation is l)ertormed manually,and the result shows that 10,000 sentences ofthe review articles from the newspaper consist of24,332 simple sentences.
Therefore, a naturallyoccurring Japanese sentence can be considered toconsist of 2.0 2.5 simple sentences on average.The second investigation is performed manuallyon one of tile test discourses that are inentioned inthe next section, and the result shows that 95% ofthe antecedents appear in the previous or current(pre-partitioned) sentence, This result is consis-tent with the larger-scale investigation that l%l-jisawa et al(l%jisawa et al, :1991) made.
for tilesame purpose.
Fnjisawa's investigation, on 1,087sentences of the scientific journal and 1,426 sen-tences of the review articles from the newspaper,showed that 87.6% of the antecedents appearedin the previous or current sentence and 95.1% ap-peared ill tile previous two sentences or currentsentence.
The third experiment is performed ontwo of the test discourses in the next section, byimplementing two versions of the centering algo-rithms that are mentioned in the hast section antiwn'ying tim range of simple sentences where the.antecedent of a zero pronoun is searched from tileprevious sentence to the previous ten sentences.Tile experiment shows that the accnraey improvesuntil the previous 2 4 sentences are searched, butdegrades after that.Totally taking into account these results, wedetermine that tile antecedents are searched inthe previous four simple sentences.
Since the an-tecedent tends to appear in the closer sentence to~he zero t)ronoun, as 141jisawa's investigation i di-cates, we deternfine the following forward centerranking among the Cfs of tile previous four simpleSe l l tences :c} > > > c},where C} ~ represents the C I of the n-th silnplesentence froln the current sentence.3.2 Tak ing  into account  the  in fo rmat ionof  emdunet ive  postpos i t ionsEven if the antecedents are searched in the pre-vious tour simple sentences, imple ~partition' ap-proach might not yield good performance, becausetile information of conjunctive postpositions thatare between two adjacent simple sentences i nottaken into account.
For exmnple, consider the fol-lowing sentences:(a) Taro wa issyoukenmei benkyousiteita.
(b) Jiro ga koe wo kake temo,kizukanakatta.These sentences are partitioned into the folh)wingsimple, sentences:(a) Taro wa issyoukenmei benkyou siteita.TopicTaro was studying tmr(i.
(bl)Jiro ga ( (/5 ni ) koe wo kake telno,Subj ConjAlthough Jiro called out to him,(b2X ?
:t ga ) ( (/)~ ui ) kiznkanakatta.he did not notice ilim.Here (/5 represents a zero pronoun.
Applying the.centering algorithm to timse sentences, tile processbecomes as follows:(a) : C~ = \ [T , .
'o \ ] ,  C~ - \['?\]a(b l )  : </5 = Taro, Cf = \[Jiro, Taro \ ] ,  6% =Taro(b2) : 4)1 = ,l iT"o, (/52 = Taro, Cf =\[,lifo, Taro\], G, = TaroTherefore, the counter-intuitive interpretationthat 'J iro did not notice Taro' is obtained.Since two adjacent simple sentences in a com-plex sentence are combined together by the con-junctive postposition that indicates the relation-ship between theln, using the intorination of theconjunctive postposition might ilnprove tim per-tormanee of the zero pronoun resolution.To clarify how tile zero pronoun resolution relieson the intormation of conjunctive i)ostpositions,we pertorin the investigation whether tile nounphrases with the same grammatical property agreein two adjacent simple sentences that have a con-junctive postposition tmtween timm, by extractingsentences with conjunctive postpositions Dora therevie, w articles in the newspaper and enmneratingthe agreement and disagreement.
The enulnera-lion is performed in cases where both sentenceshaw; zero pronouns and only e.ither sentence hasaThe first sentence in a discourse has no Ca.873a zero pronoun.
Twelve main conjunctive postpo-sitions are investigated.
The result of the investi-gation is quite similar to the Yoshimoto's and Mi-natal's investigations(Yoshimoto, 1986; Minaret,1974) that classify the conjunctive postpositionsinto three classes:,, Class A: 'nagara' ('while'), 'tart' ('and'),'tutu' ('while'), 'te' ('and') 4If two sentences have a conjunctive post;po-sition of class A between then:, the subjectnoun phrases tend to coincide, in both caseswhere both sentences have zero pronouns andonly either sentence has a zero pronoun.?
Class B: ' temo' ('although'), 'node' ('be-cause'), 'non)' ('although'), 'keredo' ('al-though'), 'ba' ('if'), 'kara' ('because'), 'to'('when')If two sentences have a conjunctive postposi-tion of class B between them, the antecedenttends to be not the subject of the other sen-tence, in case where only either sentence hasthe zero pronoun of the subject position.
Incase where both sentences have zero pro-nouns, tile agreement/disagreelnent dependson the context and doe.s not have any ten-dency.?
Class C: 'ga' ( 'but')Tile agreement/disagreement d pends on tilecontext and does not have any tendency.LFrom this result of the investigation, we deter-mine to apply to the zero pronoun resolution thefollowing heuristics that are concerned with con-junctive postpositions.
Since conjunctive postpo-sitions of class A have a strong preference thattwo subjects in adjacent sentences tend to coin-cide, instead of the centering alger)thin, we usethis preference tbr tile zero pronoun resolution inthe simple sentence after the conjuimtive postpo-sitions of class A, and try to find the antecedentsof zero pronouns in the same position of the adja-cent sentence, if any.
In this case also, the centerof the current sentence is computed similarly tothe ordinary algorithm, and the antecedent of thezero pronoun becomes the Cb of tile current sen-tence.In case of conjunctive postpositions of class B,the antecedent tends to lie not the subject of theother sentence if one of tile sentences has the zeropronoun of the subject position.
We think thistendency in)plies that noun phrases in the sen-tence before the conjunctive t)ostt)ositions of classB tend to be not the antecedents of zero pro-nouns in the next sentences.
Therefore, we givethese noun phrases the least t)reference as the an-tecedents, although the.
zero pronoun resolution isperforlned by the original centering algorithm.4In parentheses, we show the direct translation ofconjunct;ive postpositions into English.Since conjunctive postpositions of class C haveno preference for the antecedents of zero pronouns,the zero pronoun resolution is performed as usual.Consider again the following sentences:(a) Taro wa issyoukenmei benkyou siteita.TopicTaro was studying hard.
(bl)liro ga ( ?
n i )  koe we lmke temo,Subj ConjAlthough Jiro called out to hiln,(b2)( 051 ga ) ( ?2 eli ) kizukanakatta.he did not notice him.If the original centering algorithm is applied toeach sentence uniformly, the counter-intuitive in-terpretation is obtained, as mentioned above.Taking into account the ilflbrmation of conjunc-tive postpositions and applying the above heuris-tics to the points, since (bl) and (l/2) have theconjunctive postposition of class B, ' temo' (%l-though'), between them, the noun phrases it: sen-tence (bl) have the least preference and the orderof C~, ix) the sentence (bl) becomes tile oppositeto the case of the original centering algorithm.Therefore, the antecedents of tile zero pronounsin sentence (b2) are identified as follows:c i  = C,, -F\](bi) : ?
= T,,,.o, C, = Ji,.o\], C,,Taro(t/2) : (fit -- Taro, e/5 2 =, \ ] i ro ,  C l =\[Taro, J iro\], Ct, = TaroHere this interpretation that 'Taro (lid not noticeJiro' fits our intuition.4 Exper iment  and  D iscuss ionIn the last; section, we des(:ribed our zero pronounresolution method that can handle colnplex sen.tences based on tile centering theory.
It di\[lk;rsKoln tile original centering algorithm in the follow-ing two t)oints.
After partitioning COlnplex sen-tences into inultiple sinli)le sentences, it searchestile ~mtecedents in the previous four simple sen-tences, instead of only a previous sentence.
Sec-ondly, it; takes into account the information ofconjunctive postpositions that are between twosinlple sentences, by classifying them into threeclasses.In this section, we describe the experiments hatour zero pronoun resolution method is applied toreal Japanese discourses, to evaluate the effective-ness.
We inlplement wo versions of our zero pro-nouI) resolution systems which are based on twoversions of the centering algorithms teat are inen-tioned in sect)oil two respectively, and ewfluatethe Imrl'orina.nce by comparing ours with the per-fl)rmanee of the original ee.ntering algorithms.As our test, discourses, we use 275 (pre-partitioned) sentences from tive discourses in to-tal, whietl are a review article in the newspaper,a tblk-tale, and a novel.

's, although8' /5she handles only sentences ofthe form 'SX becauseSY,' and uses Sidner's focusing framework(Sidner,1983), that is different from the centering theorythat our method is based on.
Purthermore, theeffectiveness ofher work is not evaluated with realdiscourses.Takada's work(T&kada nd Doi, 1994) might bethe only exception that proposes the zero pronounresolution method based on the centering theoryand evaluates its effectiveness with real discourses.Since he handles not only zero pronouns but alsoovert pronouns, the exact comparison is difficult,but his approach, that is based on Kameyama'sapproach, yields the performance of 74.8% if theresults for overt pronouns are excluded.
In addi-tion, to handle complex sentences, he adopts theother approach where they are treated as a singleunit, and admits that some problems arise becauseof this approach.Taking into account the information of conjunc-tive elements in the pronoun resolution reminds usof the works that use the establishment of coher-ence relations between clauses for pronoun reso-lution(Hobbs, 1979; Kehler, 1993).
They try toestablish coherence relations by the costly infer-ence, while we use only the surface information.5 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we presented a simple method tohandle complex sentences with the centering the-ory and described our framework that can identifythe antecedents of zero pronouns in naturally oc-curring Japanese discourses.
We also presentedtile evaluation of our framework with real dis-courses, although the evaluation is not so large-scale to assert he effectiveness of our framework.Our simple method yielded the accuracy of 78%for the zero pronoun resolution.Since our method that is presented in this paperis based on the centering theory and basically usesonly syntactic information, we plan to incorporatethe semantic onstraints hat filter anomalous an-tecedents for zero pronouns, and take into accountthe global structure of discourses.
We think thepreliminary results of our system in this paper arepromising since incorporating the information ofsemantic onstraints and the global structure ofdiscourses will improve the performance.ReferencesS.E.
