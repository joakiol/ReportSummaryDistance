Our abstract machine operates on grammar s encoded in a unification-based TypedFeature Structure formalism, and is capable of both generation and parsing.
For efficient gener-ation, grammars are first inverted to a suitable form, and then compiled into abstract machineinstructions.
A dual compiler translates the same input grammar into an abstract machineprogram for parsing.
Both generation and parsing programs are executed under the same(chart-based) evaluation strategy: This results in an efficient, bidirectional (parsing/generation)System for Natural Language Processing.
Moreover, the system possesses ample debugging fea-tures, and thus can serve as a user-friendly environment for bidirectional grammar design anddevelopment.1 Overv iewAn input for the generation 1 task is a logical form which represents a meaning, and a grammar togovern the generation process.
The output consists of one or more phrases in the language of thegrammar whose meaning is (up to logical equivalence) the given logical form.The system robe  demonstrated applies an Abstract.Machine (AM) approach for Natural Lan-guage Generation, within the framework of Typed Feature Structures (Carpenter, 1992b).
Such amachine is an abstraction over an ordinary computer, lying somewhere between regular high-levellanguages and common hardware architectures.
Programming an Abstract Machine has proved-fruitful in previous research, reaching a peak as a highly efficient echnique to build Prolog compil-ers (Ait-Kaci, 199!
).AMALIA 2 has two compilers of grammars into Abstract Machine instructions; the outputs ofcompilation are AM programs which perform either chart generation or chart parsing, both accord-ing to the given grammar.
Both tasks use an auxiliary table (chart) to store intermediate processingresults..AMALIA has a uniform core engine for bottom-up chart processing, which interprets thegiven (abstract machine ) program, and realizes the generation or parsing task.
In the  case of gen-eration it is the given semantic meaning whose components are consumed in the process.
The onlydifferences between the two processing directions are in the nature of chart items and interpretationo f  the final results.
Thereby, AMALIA makes dual use of its chart and forms a complete bidirectionalnatural language system, which is considered an advantage in the literature (Strzalk0wski, 1994).The system is capable of very efficient processing, since grammars are precompiled irectly intoabstract machine instructions, which are subsequently executed over and over.lln this work we mean by "generation" what is sometimes known also as "syntactic generation".
Thus, no text.plannin$, speaker intentions and the like are considered here.
/2The acronym stands for "Abstract MAchine for Llnguistic Applications".
..276Logical forms specified as meanings by input grammars are given in a so-called predicate-argument structure a.
Thus, meanings are built from basic units (feature structures), each havinga predicate and (optionally) a number of arguments.
Our approach also allows ,k-abstractionsover predicate-argument constructs, as well as systematic encoding of second- and higher-orderfunctions.Grammars are usually designed in a form oriented towards the analysis of a string and nottowards generation from a (usually nested) semantic form.
In other words, rules reflect the phrasestructure and not the predicate-argument structure.
It is therefore useful to transform the grammarin order to enable systematic reflection of any given logical form in the productions.
For thispurpose, we apply to the input grammar an inversion procedure, based upon 4 (Samuelsson, 1995),to render tile rules with tile nested predicate-argument structure, corresponding to that of inputlogical forms.
The resultant "inverted" grammar is thus more suitable for performing the generationtask.
Once the grammar is inverted, the generation process can be directed by the input semanticform; elements of the input are consumed uring generation just like words are consumed uringparsing.
Grammars must satisfy certain requirements in order for them to be invertible.
However,ttle requirements are not overly restrictive and allow encoding of a variety of natural languagegrail\] mars.Grammar inversion is performed prior to compilation for generation.
The given grammar isenhanced in a way that will uhimately enable to reconstruct the words spannedby the semanticforms.
To achieve this aim, ea.ch rule constituent is extended by an additional special-purposefeature.
The value Of this feature for tile rule's head is set to the concatenation of its values in thebody constituents, to reflect the original phrase structure of the rule.Figure 1 delineates an overview of AM-based generation.
After the grammar is inverted, it iscompiled into the abstract machine code.
At run time, the given logical form is decomposed intomeaning components, which initialize the AM chart, and then the generation program is invoked.
Ifgeneration terminates, it yields a (possibly empty) set of feature structures; a grammar-independentpost-processing routine an'alyzes these structures and retrieves the generated phrases per se.G ~Inversion }Logicalform "---r - - /  I ANsmoke (john)<john, Smoke>-1,,jAMALIAsm,"John" "smokes""Johnokes"Figure h An overview of generation with Abstract Machine.This outline only contains a brief description of software features and capabilities.
For a theo-retical background on using an abstract machine for Natural Language Parsing refer to (Wintnerand Francez, 1995; Wintner, 1997).
(Gabrii0vich, 1998) gives more details on Natural LanguageGeneration with Abstract Machine.
(Wintner, Gabrilovich, and Francez, 1997a) describes ,4MALIA3The predicate-argument structure is analogous to the familiar representation Of semantic logical forms withfirst-order terms.4Samuelsson's inversion algorithm was originally developed for definite clause grammars.
We adapted it to theTyped Feature Structure formalism.277as a unified platform for parsing and generation, elaborating more on the way the two directionsare integrated into a single system.2 .AMALIA functionality.AMALIA operates On input grammars encoded in a subset of the ALE specification language (Car-penter , 1992a) In particular, .AMALIA supports the same type hierarchies as ALE does, with exactlythe same specification syntax.
This means that the user can specify any bounded-complete partialorder as the type hierarchy.
In contrast to ALE, .AMALIA allows appropriateness loops in the typehierarchy.
On the other hand, .AMALIA does not support ype constraints and relational extensions..AMALIA uses a subset of ALE's syntax for describing totally well-typed, possibly cyclic, non-disjunctive feature structures.
Set values, as in ALE, are not supported, but list values are..AMALIAdoes not respect he distinction between intensionol and extensional types (Carpenter, 1992b,Chapter 8).
Also, feature structures cannot incorporate inequality constraints.
?4MALIA supports macros in a similar way tO:ALE.
The syntax is the same, and macros can haveparameters or call other macros (though not recursively, of course).
ALE'S special macros for listsare supported by AMALIA.
Lexical rules are not supported in this version of AMALXA..AMALIA'Ssyntax for pliraze structure rules is similar to ALE'S, with the exception of the cats> specification(permitting a list of categories in the body of a rule) which is not supported.
?4MALIA uses ALE'Ssyntax in describing lexical entries, and allows disjunctive lexical entries, separated by semicolons.?
.AMALIA is implemented in ANSI-C, augmented by, lea: and yacc to implement the input acquisi-tion module , and Tcl/Tk to build the graphical user interface.
The application is compatible witha variety Of platforms, such as SUN and SILICON GRAPHICS workstations running UNIX operatingsystem, as well as IBM PC running V~rlNDOWS'95 and LINUX.
For a detailed escription and acomplete user's guide of AMALIA refer to (Wintner, Gabrilovich, and Francez, 1997b).?
There are two versions of .AMALIA: an interactive, user-friendly program with a graphical userinterface, and a non'interactive but more efficient version for batch processing.
The former programprovides extensive debugging capabilities, and is ideally suited for developing reversible grammars.Figure 2 presents a sample snapshot of the program screen.
In the case of generation, the"Input string" field specifies the name of the query file, which contains (an ALE description of) afeature structure representing the input semantic form.
In this example, the query file encodes thelogical form Vx(man(x)--, dream(z)); the feature structure for this query is shown in the figure overthe main program screen.
The "Messages" window displays the phrases generated (if any).
Thefeature structures that encode these phrases are also displayed graphically, in separate windows(not shown in the figure).
In the case of parsing, the "Input string" field contains the word stringto be parsed, and the program eventually displays feature structures assigned to this string by theparser (if any).ReferencesAit-Kaci, Hassan.
