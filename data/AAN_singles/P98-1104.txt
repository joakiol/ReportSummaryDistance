A Statistical Analysis of Morphemes in Japanese TerminologyKyo KAGEURANational Center for Science Information Systems3-29-10tsuka,  Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 112-8640 JapanE-Mail: kyo@rd.nacsis.ac.jpAbstractIn this paper I will report the result of a quan-titative analysis of the dynamics of the con-stituent elements of Japanese terminology.
InJapanese technical terms, the linguistic contri-bution of morphemes greatly differ according totheir types of origin.
To analyse this aspect, aquantitative method is applied, which can prop-erly characterise the dynamic nature of mor-phemes in terminology on the basis of a smallsample.1 In t roduct ionIn computational linguistics, the interest in ter-minological applications such as automatic termextraction is growing, and many studies usethe quantitative information (cf.
Kageura &Umino, 1996).
However, the basic quantita-tive nature of terminological structure, whichis essential for terminological theory and appli-cations, has not yet been exploited.
The staticquantitative descriptions are not sufficient, asthere are terms which do not appear in the sam-ple.
So it is crucial to establish some models, bywhich the terminological structure beyond thesample size can be properly described.In Japanese terminology, the roles of mor-phemes are different according to their typesof origin, i.e.
the morphemes borrowed mainlyfrom Western languages (borrowed morphemes)and the native morphemes including Chinese-origined morphemes which are the majority.There are some quantitative studies (Ishii, 1987;Nomura & Ishii, 1989), but they only treat thestatic nature of the sample.Located in the intersection of these twobackgrounds, the aim of the present study istwofold, i.e.
(1) to introduce a quantitativeframework in which the dynamic nature of ter-minology can be described, and to examineits theoretical validity, and (2) to describe thequantitative dynamics of morphemes as a 'mass'in Japanese terminology, with reference to thetypes of origin.2 Terminologica l  Data2.1 The  DataWe use a list of different terms as a sample,and observe the quantitative nature of the con-stituent elements or morphemes.
The quantita-tive regularities is expected to be observed atthis level, because a large portion of terms iscomplex (Nomura & Ishii, 1989), whose forma-tion is systematic (Sager, 1990), and the quan-titative nature of morphemes in terminology isindependent of the token frequency of terms, be-cause the term formation is a lexical formation.With the correspondences between text andterminology, sentences and terms, and wordsand morphemes, the present work can be re-garded as parallel to the quantitative study ofwords in texts (Baayen, 1991; Baayen, 1993;Mandelbrot, 1962; Simon, 1955; Yule, 1944;Zipf, 1935).
Such terms as 'type', 'token', 'vo-cabulary', etc.
will be used in this context.Two Japanese terminological data are usedin this study: computer science (CS: Aiso, 1993)and psychology (PS: Japanese Ministry of Ed-ucation, 1986).
The basic quantitative data aregiven in Table 1, where T, N, and V(N) in-dicate the number of terms, of running mor-phemes (tokens), and of different morphemes(types), respectively.In computer science, the frequencies of theborrowed and the native morphemes are notvery different.
In psychology, the borrowed638Domain  \[ T N V(N~ N/T  N /V(N)  \] Of, \[CS al l  14983 36640 5176 2.45 7.08 0.211 "'borrowed 14696 2809 5.23 0 .242native 21944 2367 9.27 0 .174PS  al l  6272 14314 3594 2,28 5.98 0.235borrowed 1541 993 1.55 0.309native 12773 2599 4.91 0 .207Table 1.
Basic Figures of the Terminological Datamorphemes constitute only slightly more than10% of the tokens.
The mean frequencyN/V(N)  of the borrowed morphemes i  muchlower than the native morphemes in both do-mains.2.2 LNRE Nature  o f  the  DataThe LNRE (Large Number of Rare Events)zone (Chitashvili & Baayen, 1993) is defined asthe range of sample size where the populationevents (different morphemes) are far from beingexhausted.
This is shown by the fact that thenumbers of hapax legomena nd of dislegomenaare increasing (see Figure 1 for hapax).A convenient test to see if the sample is lo-cated in the LNRE zone is to see the ratio ofloss of the number of morpheme types, calcu-lated by the sample relative frequencies as theestimates of population probabilities.
Assumingthe binomial model, the ratio of loss is obtainedby:CL = (V(N) - E\[V(N)\])/V(N)~'~m>_l V(m, g)(1 - p(i\[f(i,N)=m\], N)) NV(N)where:f(i, N) : frequency of a morpheme wi in a sampleof N.p(i, N) = f(i, N) /N : sample relative frequency.m : frequency class or a number of occurrence.V(m, N) : the number of morpheme types occur-ring m times (spectrum elements) in a sampleof N.In the two data, we underestimate the numberof morpheme types by more than 20% (CL inTable 1), which indicates that they are clearlylocated in the LNRE zone.3 The  LNRE FrameworkWhen a sample is located in the LNRE zone,values of statistical measures such as type-tokenratio, the parameters of 'laws' (e.g.
of Mandel-brot, 1962) of word frequency distributions, etc.change systematically according to the samplesize, due to the unobserved events.
To treatLNRE samples, therefore, the factor of samplesize should be taken into consideration.Good (1953) gives a method of re-estimatingthe population probabilities of the types in thesample as well as estimating the probabilitymass of unseen types.
There is also work onthe estimation of the theoretical vocabulary size(Efron & Thisted, 1976; National Language Re-search Institute, 1958; Tuldava, 1980).
How-ever, they do not give means to estimate suchvalues as V(N),  V(m, N) for arbitrary samplesize, which are what we need.
The LNRE frame-work (Chitashvili & Baayen, 1993) offers themeans uitable for the present study.3.1 B inomia l /Po isson  Assumpt ionAssume that there are S different morphemeswi, i = 1,2,...S, in the terminological pop-ulation, with a probability Pl associated witheach of them.
Assuming the binomial distribu-tion and its Poisson approximation, we can ex-press the expected numbers of morphemes andof spectrum elements in a given sample of sizeN as follows:S SE\[V(N)\] = S -  E(1  - pi)g = E(  1 _ e-NP,).
(1)i=1  i=1$i=1$= ~--~(~p,)~e-Np'/m!.
(2)i=1As our data is in the LNRE zone, we cannotestimate Pi.
Good (1953) and Good & Toulmin(1956) introduced the method of interpolatingand extrapolating the number of types for ar-bitrary sample size, but it cannot be used forextrapolating to a very large size.3.2 The  LNRE Mode lsAssume that the distribution of grouped proba-bility p follows a distribution 'law', which can beexpressed by some structural type distributionG(p) s = ~i=1 I\[p~>p\], where I = 1 when pi > Pand 0 otherwise.
Using G(p), the expressions(1) and (2) can be re-expressed as follows:E\ [V(N) I  = (1 - e -~ ' )  da(p) .
(3)639~0 ~ E\[V(rn, N)\] = (Np)"~e-NP/m!
dG(p).
(4)where dG(p) = G(pj) - G(pj+l ) around PJ, and0 otherwise, in which p is now grouped for thesame value and indexed by the subscript j thatindicates in ascending order the values of p.In using some explicit expressions such aslognormal 'law' (Carrol, 1967) for G(p), weagain face the problem of sample size depen-dency of the parameters ofthese 'laws'.
To over-come the problem, a certain distribution modelfor the population is assumed, which manifestsitself as one of the 'laws' at a pivotal sample sizeZ.
By explicitly incorporating Z as a parame-ter, the models can be completed, and it be-comes possible (i) to represent the distributionof population probabilities by means of G(p)with Z and to estimate the theoretical vocabu-lary size, and (ii) to interpolate and extrapolateV(N)  and V(m,  N) to the arbitrary sample sizeN, by such an expression:E\[V(m, N)\] = --I = -(~(Z-'-P))'~)m!
e-~(zP) dG(p)The parameters of the model, i.e.
the orig-inal parameters of the 'laws' of word frequencydistributions and the pivotal sample size Z, areestimated by looking for the values that mostproperly describe the distributions of spectrumelements and the vocabulary size at the givensample size.
In this study, four LNRE mod-els were tried, which incorporate the lognormal'law' (Carrol, 1967), the inverse Gauss-Poisson'law' (Sichel, 1986), Zipf's 'law' (Zipf, 1935) andYule-Simon 'law' (Simon, 1955).4 Analysis of Terminology4.1 Random Permutat ionUnlike texts, the order of terms in a given ter-minological sample is basically arbitrary.
Thusterm-level random permutation can be used toobtain the better descriptions of sub-samples.In the following, we use the results of 1000 term-level random permutations for the empirical de-scriptions of sub-samples.In fact, the results of the term-level andmorpheme-level permutations almost coincide,with no statistically significant difference.
Fromthis we can conclude that the binomial/Poissonassumption of the LNRE models in the previoussection holds for the terminological data.4.2 Quantitative MeasuresTwo measures are used for observing the dy-namics of morphemes in terminology.
The firstis the mean frequency of morphemes:NX(V(N))- V(N) (5)The repeated occurrence of a morpheme indi-cates that it is used as a constituent element ofterms, as the samples consist of term types.
Asit is not likely that the same morpheme occurstwice in a term, the mean frequency indicatesthe average number of terms which is connectedby a common morpheme.A more important measure is the growthrate, P(N) .
If we observe E\[V(N)\]  for changingN, we obtain the growth curve of the morphemetypes.
The slope of the growth curve gives thegrowth rate.
By taking the first derivate ofE\[V(N)\] given by equation (3), therefore, weobtain the growth rate of the morpheme types:~N E\[(V(1, g)\] P(N) = E\[V(N)\] = N (6)This "expresses in a very real sense the proba-bility that new types will be encountered whenthe ... sample is increased" (Baayen, 1991).For convenience, we introduce the notationfor the complement of P(N) ,  the reuse ratio:R(N) = 1 - P(N) (7)which expresses the probability that the existingtypes will be encountered.For each type of morpheme, there are twoways of calculating P(N) .
The first is on thebasis of the total number of the running mor-phemes (frame sample).
For the borrowed mor-phemes, for instance, it is defined as:PI~(N) = E\[V~ .
.
.
.
.
.
a(1, N)\]/NThe second is on the basis of the number ofrunning morphemes of each type (item sample).For instance, for the borrowed morphemes:Pib(N) = E\[Vb .
.
.
.
.
.
a(1, N)\]/Nb .
.
.
.
.
.
,iCorrespondingly, the reuse ratio R(N)  is alsodefined in two ways.Pi reflects the growth rate of the morphemesof each type observed separately.
Each of themexpresses the probability of encountering a newmorpheme for the separate sample consisting ofthe morphemes of the same type, and does notin itself indicate any characteristics in the framesample.640On the other hand, Pf and Rf express thequantitative status of the morphemes of eachtype as a mass in terminology.
So the transi-tions of Pf and Rf, with changing N, expressthe changes of the status of the morphemes ofeach type in the terminology.
In terminology,Pf can be interpreted as the probability of in-corporating new conceptual elements.4.3 App l i ca t ion  of  LNRE Mode lsTable 2 shows the results of the application ofthe LNRE models, for the models whose meansquare errors of V(N) and V(1,N) are mini-mal for 40 equally-spaced intervals of the sam-ple.
Figure 1 shows the growth curve of themorpheme types up to the original sample size(LNRE estimations by lines and the empiricalvalues by dots).
According to Baayen (1993),a good lognormal fit indicates high productiv-ity, and the large Z of Yule-Simon model alsomeans richness of the vocabulary.
Figure 1 andthe chosen models in Table 2 confirm these in-terpretations.Domain Model Z $ V(N) E\[V(N)\]CS all Gauss-Poisson 236 56085 5176 5176.0bor rowed Lognormal 419 75296 2809 2809.0native Gauss-Poisson 104 6095 2387 2362.6PS all Losnormal 1283 30691 3594 3694.0borrowed Yule-Simon 38051 ~1 995 996.0native Gauss-Poisson 231 101 2599 2599.0* Z : p ivota l  sample  sise ; S : population number of typesTable 2.
The Applications ofLNRE ModelsFrom Figure 1, it is observed that the num-ber of the borrowed morpheme types in com-puter science becomes bigger than that of thenative morphemes around N = 15000, while inpsychology the number of the borrowed mor-phemes is much smaller within the given sam-ple range.
All the elements are still growing,which implies that the quantitative measureskeep changing.Figure 2 shows the empirical and LNRE es-timation of the spectrum elements, for m = 1to 10.
In both domains, the differences be-tween V(1, N) and V(2, N) of the borrowedmorphemes are bigger than those of the nativemorphemes.Both the growth curves in Figure 1 and thedistributions of the spectrum elements in Figure2 show, at least to the eye, the reasonable fits ofthe LNRE models.

Thestatistical validity will be examined later.4.3.1 Mean FrequencyAs the population numbers of morphemesare estimated to be finite with the excep-tion of the borrowed morphemes in psychology,limN._,oo X(V(N)) = o% which is not of muchinterest.
The more important and interestingis the actual transition of the mean frequencieswithin a realistic range of N, because the sizeof a terminology in practice is expected to belimited.Figure 3 shows the transitions of X(V(N)),based on the LNRE models, up to 2N in com-puter science and 5N in psychology, plotted ac-cording to the size of the frame sample.
Themean frequencies are consistently higher in com-puter science than in psychology.

The valuesof Pib(N) and Pi,(N) in both domains showthat, in general, the borrowed morphemes aremore 'productive' than the native morphemes,though the actual value depends on the domain.Comparing the two domains by Pfau (N), wecan observe that at the beginning the terminol-ogy of psychology relies more on the new mor-phemes than in computer science, but the valuesare expected to become about the same aroundN -- 70000.Pfs for the borrowed and native morphemesshow interesting characteristics in each domain.Firstly, in computer science, at the relativelyearly stage of terminological growth (i.e.

Changes of the Growth Ratesgradually approaching the relative token fre-quencies.5 Theoretical Validity5.1  L ingu is t i c  Va l id i tyWe have seen that the LNRE models offer auseful means to observe the dynamics of mor-phemes, beyond the sample size.
As mentioned,what is important in terminological nalyses isto obtain the patterns of transitions of somecharacteristic quantities beyond the sample sizebut still within the realistic range, e.g.
2N, 3N,etc.
Because we have been concerned with themorphemes a  a mass, we could safely use N in-stead of T to discuss the status of morphemes,642implicitly assuming that the average number ofconstituent morphemes in a term is stable.Among the measures we used in the anal-ysis of morphemes, the most important is thegrowth rate.
The growth rate as the mea-sure of the productivity of affixes (Baayen,1991) was critically examined by van Marle(1991).
One of his essential points was the re-lation between the performance-based measureand the competence-based concept of produc-tivity.
As the growth rate is by definition aperformance-based measure, it is not unnatu-ral that the competence-based interpretation ofthe performance-based productivity measure isrequested, when the object of the analysis is di-rectly related to such competence-oriented no-tion as derivation.
In terminology, however,this is not the case, because the notion ofterminology is essentially performance-oriented(Kageura, 1995).
The growth rate, which con-cerns with the linguistic performance, directlyreflects the inherent nature of terminologicalstructure 1.One thing which may also have to be ac-counted for is the influence of the starting sam-ple size.
Although we assumed that the order ofterms in a given terminology is arbitrary, it may?
not be the case, because usually a smaller sam-ple may well include more 'central' terms.
Wemay need further study concerning the status ofthe available terminological corpora.5.2 S ta t i s t i ca l  Va l id i tyFigure 5 plots the values of the z-score for E\[V\]and E\[V(1)\], for the models used in the analy-ses, at 20 equally-spaced intervals for the firsthalf of the sample 2.
In psychology, all but onevalues are within the 95% confidence interval.In computer science, however, the fit is not sogood as in psychology.Table 3 shows the X 2 values calculated onthe basis of the first 15 spectrum elements atthe original sample size.
Unfortunately, the X 2values show that the models have obtained thefits which are not ideal, and the null hypothesisXNote however that the level of what is meant by theword 'performance' is different, as Baayen (1991) is text-oriented, while here it is vocabulary-oriented.2To calculate the variance we need V(2N), so the testcan be applied only for the first half of the samplecDV(N):aU~,, o - -  V(N):borrow~r#~q~l  - - "  V(N):native~ , o ~ioV(1,N):all~--  Y(IJ~:bon'awec5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20Intewals up to N/2 Intervals up to N/2(a) Computer Science (b) PsychologyFig.

X 2 Values for the ModelsUnlike texts (Baayen, 1996a;1996b), the ill-fits of the growth curve of the models are notcaused by the randomness assumption of themodel, because the results of the term-level per-mutations, used for calculating z-scores, are sta-tistically identical to the results of morpheme-level permutations.
This implies that we needbetter models if we pursue the better curve-fitting.
On the other hand, if we emphasisethe theoretical assumption of the models of fre-quency distributions used in the LNRE analy-ses, it is necessary to introduce the finer distinc-tions of morphemes.6 ConclusionsUsing the LNRE models, we have succesfullyanalysed the dynamic nature of the morphemesin Japanese terminology.
As the majority ofthe terminological data is located in the LNREzone, it is important o use the statistical frame-work which allows for the LNRE characteristics.The LNRE models give the suitable means.We are currently extending our research tointegrating the quantitative nature of morpho-logical distributions to the qualitative mode\] ofterm formation, by taking into account he po-643sitional and combinatorial nature of morphemesand the distributions of term length.AcknowledgementI would like to express my thanks to Dr. Har-aid Baayen of the Max Plank Institute for Psy-cholinguistics, for introducing me to the LNREmodels and giving me advice.
