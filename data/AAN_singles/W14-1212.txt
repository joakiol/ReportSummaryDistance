DinuCenter for Computational Linguistics, University of BucharestFaculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharestalina.ciobanu@my.fmi.unibuc.ro, ldinu@fmi.unibuc.roAbstractIn this paper we investigate the impactof translation on readability.
We proposea quantitative analysis of several shallow,lexical and morpho-syntactic features thathave been traditionally used for assessingreadability and have proven relevant forthis task.
We conduct our experimentson a parallel corpus of transcribed parlia-mentary sessions and we investigate read-ability metrics for the original segments oftext, written in the language of the speaker,and their translations.1 IntroductionSystems for automatic readability assessment havebeen studied since the 1920s and have received anincreasing attention during the last decade.
Earlyresearch on readability assessment focused onlyon shallow language properties, but nowadays na-tural language processing technologies allow theinvestigation of a wide range of factors which in-fluence the ease which a text is read and under-stood with.
These factors correspond to differ-ent levels of linguistic analysis, such as the le-xical, morphological, semantic, syntactic or dis-course levels.
However, readability depends notonly on text properties, but also on characteristicsof the target readers.
Aspects such as backgroundknowledge, age, level of literacy and motivation ofthe expected audience should be considered whendeveloping a readability assessment system.
Al-though most readability metrics were initially de-veloped for English, current research has shown agrowing interest in other languages, such as Ger-man, French, Italian or Portuguese.Readability assessment systems are relevant fora wide variety of applications, both human- andmachine-oriented (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011).
Se-cond language learners and people with disabili-ties or low literacy skills benefit from such sys-tems, which provide assistance in selecting read-ing material with an appropriate level of com-plexity from a large collection of documents ?for example, the documents available on the web(Collins-Thompson, 2011).
Within the medicaldomain, the investigation of the readability levelof medical texts helps developing well-suited ma-terials to increase the level of information for pre-venting diseases (Richwald et al., 1989) and to au-tomatically adapt technical documents to variouslevels of medical expertise (Elhadad and Sutaria,2007).
For natural language processing tasks suchas machine translation (Stymne et al., 2013), textsimplification (Aluisio et al., 2010), speech recog-nition (Jones et al., 2005) or document summa-rization (Radev and Fan, 2000), readability ap-proaches are employed to assist the process andto evaluate and quantify its performance and ef-fectiveness.1.1 Related WorkMost of the traditional readability approaches in-vestigate shallow text properties to determine thecomplexity of a text.
These readability metrics arebased on assumptions which correlate surface fea-tures with the linguistic factors which influencereadability.
For example, the average number ofcharacters or syllables per word, the average num-ber of words per sentence and the percentage ofwords not occurring among the most frequent nwords in a language are correlated with the lexi-cal, syntactic and, respectively, the semantic com-plexity of the text.
The Flesch-Kincaid measure(Kincaid et al., 1975) employs the average numberof syllables per word and the average number ofwords per sentence to assess readability, while theAutomated Readability Index (Smith and Senter,1967) and the Coleman-Liau metric (Coleman andLiau, 1975) measure word length based on charac-ter count rather than syllable count; they are func-104tions of both the average number of characters perword and the average number of words per sen-tence.
Gunning Fog (Gunning, 1952) and SMOG(McLaughlin, 1969) account also for the percent-age of polysyllabic words and the Dale-Chall for-mula (Dale and Chall, 1995) relies on word fre-quency lists to assess readability.
The traditionalreadability approaches are not computationally ex-pensive, but they are only a coarse approximationof the linguistic factors which influence readabil-ity (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).
According to Siand Callan (2001), the shallow features employedby standard readability indices are based on as-sumptions about writing style that may not applyin all situations.Along with the development of natural lan-guages processing tools and machine learningtechniques, factors of increasing complexity , cor-responding to various levels of linguistic analy-sis, have been taken into account in the study ofreadability assessment.
Si and Callan (2001) andCollins-Thompson and Callan (2004) use statisti-cal language modeling and Petersen and Ostendorf(2009) combine features from statistical languagemodels, syntactic parse trees and traditional met-rics to estimate reading difficulty.
Feng (2009) ex-plores discourse level attributes, along with lexicaland syntactic features, and emphasizes the value ofthe global semantic properties of the text for pre-dicting text readability.
Pitler and Nenkova (2008)propose and analyze two perspectives for the taskof readability assessment: prediction and ranking.Using various features, they reach the conclusionthat only discourse level features exhibit robust-ness across the two tasks.
Vajjala and Meurers(2012) show that combining lexical and syntac-tic features with features derived from second lan-guage acquisition research leads to performanceimprovements.Although most readability approaches deve-loped so far deal with English, the developmentof adequate corpora for experiments and the studyof readability features tailored for other languageshave received increasing attention.
For Italian,Franchina and Vacca (1986) propose the Flesch-Vacca formula, which is an adaptation of theFlesch index (Flesch, 1946).
Another metric de-veloped for Italian is Gulpease (Lucisano andPiemontese, 1988), which uses characters insteadof syllables to measure word length and thus re-quires less resources.
Dell?Orletta et al.
(2011)combine traditional, morpho-syntactic, lexical andsyntactic features for building a readability modelfor Italian, while Tonelli et al.
(2012) propose asystem for readability assessment for Italian in-spired by the principles of Coh-Metrix (Graesseret al., 2004).
For French, Kandel and Moles(1958) propose an adaptation of the Flesch for-mula and Franc?ois and Miltsakaki (2012) inves-tigate a wide range of classic and non-classic fea-tures to predict readability level using a dataset forFrench as a foreign language.
Readability assess-ment was also studied for Spanish (Huerta, 1959)and Portuguese (Aluisio et al., 2010) using fea-tures derived from previous research on English.1.2 Readability of TranslationAccording to Sun (2012), the reception of a trans-lated text is related to cross-cultural readability.Translators need to understand the particularitiesof both the source and the target language in orderto transfer the meaning of the text from one lan-guage to another.
This process can be challenging,especially for languages with significant structuredifferences, such as English and Chinese.
Thethree-step system of translation (analysis, trans-fer and restructuring) presented by Nida and Taber(1969) summarizes the process and emphasizesthe importance of a proper understanding of thesource and the target languages.
While renderingthe source language text into the target language, itis also important to maintain the style of the docu-ment.
Various genres of text might be translatedfor different purposes, which influence the choiceof the translation strategy.
For example, for politi-cal speeches the purpose is to report exactly whatis communicated in a given text (Trosborg, 1997).Parallel corpora are very useful in studyingthe properties of translation and the relationshipsbetween source language and target language.Therefore, the corpus-based research has becomemore and more popular in translation research.Using the Europarl (Koehn, 2005) parallel cor-pus, van Halteren (2008) investigates the auto-matic identification of the source language of Eu-ropean Parliament speeches, based on frequencycounts of word n-grams.
Islam and Mehler (2012)draw attention to the absence of adequate corporafor studies on translation and propose a resourcesuited for this purpose.1052 Our Approach and MethodologyThe problem that we address in this paper iswhether human translation has an impact on read-ability.
Given a text T1in a source languageL1and its translations in various target languagesL2, ..., Ln, how does readability vary?
Is the orig-inal text in L1easier to read and understand thanits translation in a target language Li?
Which lan-guage is closest to the source language, in termsof readability?
We investigate several shallow,lexical and morpho-syntactic features that havebeen widely used and have proven relevant for as-sessing readability.
We are interested in observ-ing the differences between the feature values ob-tained for the original texts and those obtained fortheir translations.
Although some of the metrics(such as average word length) might be language-specific, most of them are language-independentand a comparison between them across languagesis justified.
The 10 readability metrics that we ac-count for are described in Section 3.2.We run our experiments on Europarl (Koehn,2005), a multilingual parallel corpus which is de-scribed in detail in Section 3.1.
We investigate 5Romance languages (Romanian, French, Italian,Spanish and Portuguese) and, in order to excerptan adequate dataset of parallel texts, we adopt astrategy similar to that of van Halteren (2008):given n languagesL1, ..., Ln, we apply the follow-ing steps:1. we select L1as the source language2.
we excerpt the collection of segments of textT1for which L1is the source language3.
we identify the translations T2, ..., Tnof T1inthe target languages L2, ..., Ln4.
we compute the readability metrics forT1, ..., Tn5.
we repeat steps 1 ?
4 using each languageL2, ..., Lnas the source language, one at atimeWe propose two approaches to quantify andevaluate the variation in the readability feature val-ues from the original texts to their translations: adistance-based method and a multi-criteria tech-nique based on rank aggregation.3 Experimental Setup3.1 DataEuroparl (Koehn, 2005) is a multilingual paral-lel corpus extracted from the proceedings of theEuropean Parliament.
Its main intended use isas aid for statistical machine translation research(Tiedemann, 2012).
The corpus is tokenized andaligned in 21 languages.
The files contain annota-tions for marking the document (<chapter>), thespeaker (<speaker>) and the paragraph (<p>).Some documents have the attribute language forthe speaker tag, which indicates the language usedby the original speaker.
Another way of annotatingthe original language is by having the language ab-breviation written between parentheses at the be-ginning of each segment of text.
However, thereare segments where the language is not marked ineither of the two ways.
We account only for sen-tences for which the original language could bedetermined and we exclude all segments showinginconsistent values.We use the following strategy: because for theRomance languages there are very few segmentsof text for which the language attribute is consis-tent across all versions, we take into account an at-tribute L if all other Romance languages mentionit.
For example, given a paragraph P in the Ro-manian subcorpus, we assume that the source lan-guage for this paragraph is Romanian if all otherfour subcorpora (Italian, French, Spanish and Por-tuguese) mark this paragraph P with the tag ROfor language.
Thus, we obtain a collection ofsegments of text for each subcorpus.
We iden-tify 4,988 paragraphs for which Romanian is thesource language, 13,093 for French, 7,485 for Ital-ian, 5,959 for Spanish and 8,049 for Portuguese.Because we need sets of approximately equal sizefor comparison, we choose, for each language, asubset equal with the size of the smallest subset,i.e., we keep 4,988 paragraphs for each language.Note that in this corpus paragraphs are alignedacross languages, but the number of sentencesmay be different.
For example, the sentence?UE trebuie s?a fie ambit?ioas?a ?
?n combatereaschimb?arilor climatice, iar rolul energiei nucle-are s?i energiilor regenerabile nu poate fi negli-jat.
?1, for which Romanian is the source language,1Translation into English: ?The EU must be ambitious inthe battle against climate change, which means that the roleof nuclear power and renewable energy sources cannot bediscounted.
?106is translated into French in two sentences: ?L?UEdoit se montrer ambitieuse dans sa lutte contreles changements climatiques.?
and ?L?
?energienucl?eaire et les sources d?
?energie renouvelablesne peuvent donc pas ?etre ?ecart?ees.?.
Therefore, wematch paragraphs, rather than sentences, acrosslanguages.As a preprocessing step, we discard the tran-scribers?
descriptions of the parliamentary ses-sions (such as ?Applause?, ?The President in-terrupted the speaker?
or ?The session was sus-pended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00?
).According to van Halteren (2008), translationsin the European Parliament are generally made bynative speakers of the target language.
Transla-tion is an inherent part of the political activity(Sch?affner and Bassnett, 2010) and has a highinfluence on the way the political speeches areperceived.
The question posed by Sch?affner andBassnett (2010) ?What exactly happens in thecomplex processes of recontextualisation acrosslinguistic, cultural and ideological boundaries?
?summarizes the complexity of the process of trans-lating political documents.
Political texts mightcontain complex technical terms and elaboratedsentences.
Therefore, the results of our experi-ments are probably domain-specific and cannot begeneralized to other types of texts.
Although par-liamentary documents probably have a low read-ability level, our investigation is not negatively in-fluenced by the choice of corpus because we areconsistent across all experiments in terms of textgender and we report results obtained solely bycomparison between source and target languages.3.2 FeaturesWe investigate several shallow, lexical andmorpho-syntactic features that were traditionallyused for assessing readability and have provenhigh discriminative power within readability met-rics.3.2.1 Shallow FeaturesAverage number of words per sentence.
Theaverage sentence length is one of the most widelyused metrics for determining readability level andwas employed in numerous readability formulas,proving to be most meaningful in combined evi-dence with average word frequency.
Feng et al.
(2010) find the average sentence length to havehigher predictive power than all the other lexicaland syllable-based features they used.Average number of characters per word.
Itis generally considered that frequently occurringwords are usually short, so the average numberof characters per word was broadly used for mea-suring readability in a robust manner.
Many read-ability formulas measure word length in syllablesrather than letters, but this requires additional re-sources for syllabication.3.2.2 Lexical FeaturesPercentage of words from the basic lexicon.Based on the assumption that more commonwords are easier to understand, the percentage ofwords not occurring among the most frequent nin the language is a commonly used metric to ap-proximate readability.
To determine the percent-age of words from the basic lexicon, we employthe representative vocabularies for Romance lan-guages proposed by Sala (1988).Type/Token Ratio.
The proportion between thenumber of lexical types and the number of to-kens indicates the range of use of vocabulary.
Thehigher the value of this feature, the higher the vari-ability of the vocabulary used in the text.3.2.3 Morpho-Syntactic FeaturesRelative frequency of POS unigrams.
The ra-tio for 5 parts of speech (verbs, nouns, pronouns,adjectives and adverbs), computed individuallyon a per-token basis.
This feature assumes thatthe probability of a token is context-independent.For lemmatization and part of speech taggingwe use the DexOnline2machine-readable dictio-nary for Romanian and the FreeLing3(Padr?o andStanilovsky, 2012; Padr?o, 2011; Padr?o et al., 2010;Atserias et al., 2006; Carreras et al., 2004) lan-guage analysis tool suite for French, Italian, Span-ish and Portuguese.Lexical density.
The proportion of contentwords (verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs),computed on a per-token basis.
Grammatical fea-tures were shown to be useful in readability pre-diction (Heilman et al., 2007).4 Results AnalysisOur main purpose is to investigate the variabil-ity of the feature values from the original texts totheir translations.
In Table 1 we report the values2http://dexonline.ro3http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling107obtained for 10 readability metrics computed forthe Europarl subcorpora for Romanian, French,Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.
The readabilitymetrics we computed lead to several immediateremarks.
We notice that, generally, when repre-senting the values for a feature F on the real axis,the values corresponding to the translations are notplaced on the same side of the value correspond-ing to the original text.
For example, consideringfeature F3 (the percentage of words from the ba-sic lexicon), and taking Romanian as the sourcelanguage, we observe that the value for the origi-nal text is between Italian (on the left side) and theother languages (on the right side).In the absence of a widely-accepted readabilitymetric, such as the Flesch-Kincaid formula or theAutomated Readability Index, for all 5 Romancelanguages, we choose two other ways to evalu-ate the results obtained after applying the 10 read-ability features: a distance-based evaluation and amulti-criteria approach.In order to compute distance measures reliably,we normalize feature values using the followingformula:f?i=fi?
fminfmax?
fmin,where fminis the minimum value for feature Fand fmaxis the maximum value for feature F. Forexample, if F = F1 and the source language is Ro-manian, then fmin= 26.2 and fmax= 29.0.4.1 PreliminariesIn this subsection we shortly describe the two tech-niques used.
The experimented reader can skipthis subsection.4.1.1 Rank AggregationRank distance (Dinu and Dinu, 2005) is a met-ric used for measuring the similarity between tworanked lists.
A ranking of a set of n objects canbe represented as a permutation of the integers1, 2, ..., n. S is a set of ranking results, ?
?
S.?
(i) represents the rank of object i in the rankingresult ?.
The rank distance is computed as:?
(?, ?)
=n?i=1|?(i)?
?
(i)|The ranks of the elements are given from bot-tom up, i.e., from n to 1, in a Borda order.
Theelements which do not occur in any of the rank-ings receive the rank 0.In a selection process, rankings are issued fora common decision problem, therefore a rankingthat ?combines?
all the original (base) rankings isrequired.
One common-sense solution is finding aranking that is as close as possible to all the par-ticular rankings.Formally, given m partial rankings T =?1, ?2, ..., ?m, over a universe U , the rank aggre-gation problem requires a partial ranking that isas close as possible to all these rankings to be de-termined.
In other words, it requires a means ofcombining the rankings.
There are many ways tosolve this problem, one of which is by trying tofind a ranking such that the sum of rank distancesbetween it and the given rankings is minimal.
Inother words, find ?
such that:?
(?, T ) =???T?
(?, ?
)is minimal.
The set of all rankings that minimize?
(?, T ) is called the aggregations set and is de-noted by agr(T ).Apart from many paradoxes of different aggre-gation methods, this problem is NP-hard for mostnon-trivial distances (e.g., for edit distance, see(de la Higuera and Casacuberta, 2000)).
Dinuand Manea (2006) show that the rank aggregationproblem using rank distance, which minimizes thesum ?
(?, T ) of the rank distances between the ag-gregation and each given ranking, can be reducedto solving |U| assignment problems, where U isthe universe of objects.
Let n = #U .
The timecomplexity to obtain one such aggregation (theremay be more than one) is O(n4).We then transform the aggregation problem ina categorization problem as follows (Dinu andPopescu, 2008): for a multiset L of rankings, wedetermine all the aggregations of L and then weapply voting on the set of agr(L).4.1.2 Cosine DistanceCosine distance is a metric which computes theangular cosine distance between two vectors of aninner product space.
Given two vectors of fea-tures, A and B, the cosine distance is representedas follows:?
(A,B) = 1??ni=1Ai?Bi??ni=1(Ai)2??
?ni=1(Bi)2When used in positive space, the cosine distanceranges from 0 to 1.108Source Target FeaturesLanguage Language F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10RORO 26.2 5.61 0.67 0.06 0.66 0.15 0.29 0.16 0.05 0.11FR 29.0 5.06 0.79 0.03 0.59 0.13 0.35 0.06 0.04 0.06IT 27.4 5.57 0.63 0.04 0.61 0.16 0.30 0.10 0.04 0.06ES 28.3 5.18 0.81 0.04 0.53 0.15 0.24 0.09 0.03 0.03PT 26.8 5.31 0.78 0.04 0.58 0.14 0.30 0.08 0.04 0.02FRRO 24.6 5.35 0.70 0.06 0.64 0.17 0.26 0.14 0.06 0.13FR 27.4 4.86 0.81 0.04 0.58 0.14 0.32 0.05 0.06 0.09IT 25.7 5.46 0.65 0.05 0.61 0.17 0.28 0.09 0.05 0.07ES 26.3 5.11 0.82 0.05 0.53 0.16 0.23 0.08 0.04 0.04PT 25.1 5.21 0.80 0.05 0.58 0.16 0.29 0.07 0.05 0.02ITRO 29.7 5.46 0.69 0.06 0.62 0.16 0.27 0.15 0.05 0.12FR 32.4 5.00 0.80 0.04 0.58 0.14 0.33 0.06 0.05 0.08IT 30.9 5.48 0.64 0.05 0.61 0.16 0.28 0.10 0.05 0.07ES 31.8 5.15 0.82 0.04 0.53 0.16 0.23 0.09 0.04 0.03PT 30.5 5.28 0.79 0.04 0.58 0.15 0.29 0.07 0.05 0.02ESRO 27.6 5.33 0.70 0.06 0.64 0.17 0.26 0.14 0.06 0.13FR 29.9 4.91 0.81 0.04 0.58 0.14 0.32 0.05 0.05 0.09IT 27.9 5.45 0.66 0.05 0.60 0.17 0.28 0.09 0.05 0.08ES 31.1 5.02 0.83 0.05 0.52 0.16 0.22 0.08 0.05 0.04PT 28.2 5.17 0.81 0.05 0.57 0.16 0.28 0.07 0.05 0.02PTRO 29.3 5.58 0.67 0.05 0.65 0.15 0.28 0.16 0.05 0.12FR 32.8 5.04 0.80 0.03 0.58 0.13 0.34 0.06 0.04 0.07IT 30.9 5.56 0.62 0.04 0.60 0.15 0.29 0.10 0.04 0.06ES 32.5 5.15 0.81 0.03 0.53 0.15 0.24 0.09 0.03 0.03PT 30.9 5.28 0.79 0.04 0.57 0.14 0.30 0.08 0.04 0.02Table 1: Values for readability metrics applied on Europarl.

The closer the distance is to 0, the more easilycan one language be translated into the other, interms of readability.
Briefly, our first approach isas follows: for each source language L in column1 of Table 1, we consider the feature vector corre-sponding to this language from column 2 and wecompute the cosine distance between this vectorand all the other 4 vectors remaining in column 2,one for each target language.
The obtained valuesare reported in Table 2, on the line correspondingto language L.Table 2 provides not only information regard-ing the closest language, but also the hierarchy oflanguages in terms of readability.
For example,the closest language to Romanian is Italian, fol-lowed by Portuguese, French and Spanish.
Over-all, the lowest distance between an original textand its translation occurs when Italian is the sourcelanguage and Romanian the target language.
Thehighest distance is reported for translations fromRomanian into Spanish.The second approach we use for investigatingthe readability of translation is multi-criteria ag-gregation: since the 10 monitored features canbe seen as individual classifiers for readability(and in various papers they were used either in-dividually or combined as representative featuresfor predicting readability), we experiment with amulti-criteria aggregation of these metrics in orderto predict which language is closest to the sourcelanguage in terms of readability.For segments of text having the source languageL, we consider each feature Fi, one at a time, andwe compute the absolute value of the differencebetween the Fivalue for the original text and theFivalues for its translations.
Then, we sort thevalues in ascending order, thus obtaining for eachlanguage L and feature Fia ranking with 4 ele-ments (one for each translation) determined as fol-lows: the language having the lowest computedabsolute value is placed on the first position, thelanguage having the second to lowest computedabsolute value is placed on the second position,and so on.
Finally, we have, for each language L,10 rankings (one for each feature) with 4 elements(one for each translation), each ranking indicatingon the first position the target language which isclosest to the source language with regard to read-ability measured by feature Fi.
In case of equalvalues for the computed absolute distance, we con-sider all possible rankings.Given these rankings, the task we propose is todetermine which target language is closest to thesource language in terms of readability.
To solvethis requirement, we apply multi-criteria aggrega-tion based on rank distance.
For each language, weaggregate the 10 corresponding rankings and de-termine the closest language with respect to read-ability across translation.
The results we obtain forRomance languages after the rank aggregation areas follows: the closest translation language for Ro-manian is Italian (followed by Portuguese, Span-ish and French).
Conversely, for Italian the closestlanguage is Romanian (followed by Portuguese,French and Spanish).
For French, Portuguese oc-cupies the first position in the ranking (followedby Spanish, Italian and Romanian).
For Spanish,Portuguese ranks first (followed by Italian, Frenchand Romanian), while for Portuguese, Italian isthe closest language (followed by French, Spanishand Romanian).The obtained results are very similar to thosecomputed by the cosine distance and reported inTable 2.
The only difference regarding the closestlanguage in terms of readability is that rank ag-gregation reports Italian as being closest to Por-tuguese, while the cosine distance reports Frenchinstead.
However, the differences between thefirst two ranked languages for Portuguese, namelyFrench and Italian, are insignificant.1101.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.01.00.50.00.51.0RO_RORO_FRRO_ITRO_ESRO_PTFR_FRFR_ROFR_ITFR_ESFR_PTIT_ITIT_ROIT_FRIT_ESIT_PTES_ESES_ROES_FRES_IT ES_PTPT_PTPT_ROPT_FRPT_ITPT_ESoriginaltranslationFigure 1: PCA.

We use the Modular toolkit for Data Pro-cessing (MDP), a Python data processing frame-work (Zito et al., 2008).
We observe that clusterstend to be formed based on the target language.rather than based on the source language.
Whilefor Romanian and Italian the original texts are tosome extent isolated from their translations, forFrench, Spanish and Portuguese the original textsare more integrated within the groups of transla-tions.
The most compact cluster corresponds toRomanian as a target language.5 ConclusionsIn this paper we investigate the behaviour of vari-ous readability metrics across parallel translationsof texts from a source language to target lan-guages.
We focus on Romance languages and wepropose two methods for the analysis of the clos-est translation, in terms of readability.
Given a textin a source language, we determine which of itstranslations in various target languages is closestto the original text with regard to readability.
Inour future works, we plan to extend our analysis tomore languages, in order to cover a wider varietyof linguistic families.
We are mainly interested inthe 21 languages covered by Europarl.
Moreover,we intend to enrich the variety of the texts, be-ginning with an analysis of translations of literaryworks.
As far as resources are available, we planto investigate other readability metrics as well andto combine our findings with the views of humanexperts.
We believe our method can provide valu-able information regarding the difficulty of trans-lation from one language into another in terms ofreadability.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers fortheir helpful and constructive comments.
