On thebasis of the resulting DATR theory a set offully inflected forms together with their as-sociated morphosyntax can automaticallybe generated from the electronic version ofZaliznjak?s dictionary (Ilola and Mustajoki1989).
From this data we plan to develop awide-coverage morphosyntactic lemma-tizer and tagger for Russian.1 IntroductionOur goal is to undertake a detailed corpus analysisof Russian texts, focusing on the relationship be-tween morphological ambiguity (syncretism) innouns and adjectives and the comparative fre-quency of the relevant grammatical categories.
Forthis purpose, we will use two corpora, the Uppsalacorpus (L?nngren 1993, Maier 1994) and a corpusof Russian newspaper texts from the late 1990?s,for which we require detailed morphosyntactic an-notation.
However, suitably annotated versions ofthese corpora are not yet freely available and cor-pus analysis tools for Russian in general arescarce.1We have chosen, therefore, to develop our ownlemmatization and tagging technology, based onthe electronic version of Zaliznjak?s (1977) dic-1 For an indication of what is available see: http://talrusse.free.fr.For natural language processing of Slavic languages in general see for examplework on the MULTEXT-EAST project by Dimitrova, Erjavec, Ide, Kaalep,Petkevi?
and Tufis (1998) and work within the INTEX system by Vitas (2001).tionary (Ilola and Mustajoki  1989), combined witha more detailed and validated hand-crafted analysisof 1500 most frequent noun lexemes (Brown, Cor-bett, and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbettand Fraser 1995).
In this paper we describe thefirst step in this process: mapping the basic Zalizn-jak data into a hierarchical lexical database imple-mented in DATR.1.1 The Zaliznjak dictionaryZaliznjak (1977) is a reverse dictionary in bookform, dealing primarily with Russian inflectionalmorphology.
For each of the almost 100,000 lexi-cal entries, indexes refer the reader to declensiontypes and conjugations, together with stress pat-terns.
Other symbols indicate subregularities andirregularities.
As the dictionary uses such indica-tors, it gives explicit information about every in-flectional form and stress.
Ilola and Mustajoki(1989: 1-5) describe how the material was adaptedfor computer use.Zaliznjak's dictionary has been the starting pointfor a number of applications.
Anciaux (1991) madeuse of it in the creation of a spell-checker for Rus-sian, and Pavlova, Pavlov, Sproat, Shih and vanSanten (1997) used the electronic version to createlanguage-specific tables to fit into the modular ar-chitecture of the Bell Laboratories Text-to-Speechsystem.
Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) andBrown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) cre-ated a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequentnoun lexemes from Zasorina (1977).
The derivedforms from this inheritance-based lexicon were allchecked manually against Zaliznjak.
The forms arerepresented in a phonological transcription, to-gether with stress information (Brown, Corbett,Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996).
An up-dated version of this lexicon was used in Brown(1998) to compare different morphological theo-ries.1.2 OutlineThe paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 de-scribes the general principles of the mapping andexamples.
In Section 3, we discuss the technicalframework of our approach and the issues andproblems that arise.
In Section 4 we discuss thecurrent status of the mapping and principal areasfor further development including our approach tolemmatization and tagging.
Section 5 concludesthe paper.2 Mapping Zaliznjak into DATR2.1 The overall approachIn book form, Zaliznjak?s dictionary has twoparts.
The first is a set of tables identifying mor-phosyntactic classes and defining the realizationof morphological features with them.
The sec-ond is a listing of lexical entries, each followedby an index referring to a table in the first partwhich gives the paradigm for this particulartype.
For example, the word ??????
'lampshade' is a masculine noun of type 1A and assuch follows the inflectional pattern of ??????factory?
which is given as the example para-digm for masculine nouns of type 1A.1A?
????
?nom ????
?gen ?????
?dat ?????
?acc  ????
?instr ??????
?Sgloc ?????
?nom ?????
?gen ??????
?dat ??????
?acc ?????
?instr ???????
?Plloc ??????
?Table 1.
Zaliznjak?s paradigm for masculine inanimatenouns of type 1A.The electronic form contains just the set of lexi-cal entries (101401 lines, 98729 lexical entries).Thus our mapping process has two distinct compo-nents:1. manual construction of a DATR representationof the morphosyntactic class and realization in-formation from the printed paradigm tables;2. automatic construction of the individual lexicalentries from the electronic dictionary data.In practice we also introduce a third component,interfacing between the morphosyntactic classesand the automatic entries.
As we discuss below,this gives us increased flexibility in the way weinterpret the Zaliznjak data.The information in Zaliznjak's dictionary in-cludes a fair number of subregular and idiosyn-cratic cases.
The target representation, DATR, isspecifically designed to support such situations,providing concise representation of hierarchicallyorganized lexicons containing generalizations andexceptions.
We have already a formal theoreticalmodel of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Tim-berlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies ourapproach.
In addition, as we have a frequencybased resource to check against (Brown, Corbettand Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett andFraser 1995), we are in a good position to checkthe accuracy of our automatic creation of lexicalentries for the high frequency, least regular cases.The same framework can also be used to capturegeneralisations across languages (cf.
Cahill andGazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not ourcurrent goal.2.2 The hand-crafted realizationcomponentZaliznjak does not use the traditional division ofwords into declension types in his dictionary, butdivides nouns into types according to the lastgrapheme of the stem.
(Ilola and Mustajoki1989:9) For example, he distinguishes eight typesfor masculine nouns numbered 1 to 8.
These mor-phological types are then further divided accordingto stress.
The masculine noun types can occur withsix different stress patterns indicated by subcatego-ries A to F. Thus the most basic masculine nounclasses might be named M 1A, M 3C, etc.Special characters are used to further character-ize the different morphological types.
For instance,types with an * indicate the presence of a fleetingvowel such as in ??????
'father-in-law (husband?sfather)' which has the instrumental ???????.
Ani-macy is indicated in combination with gender, sothat a class such as MO 1*A is masculine, animate,type 1, stress pattern A with a fleeting vowel.This information for each lexical entry is used torefer to a table at the beginning of the dictionarywhich gives an example of the inflectional forms.These tables form the basis of a hand-craftedDATR theory in which each type is represented bya node in the DATR inheritance hierarchy.
Thisresults in a hierarchical structure of noun classes,part of which is shown here:Figure 1.
Extract of the DATR hierarchyIn each node, definitions of morphosyntactic reali-zations specific to that noun class are given.
In-formation that is shared between (or default for)classes is inherited from the parent node.
A smallfragment of the theory is provided here:2NOMINAL:<mor> == "<stem>" "<mor suffix>".2 The DATR code is slightly simplified for expository purposes.
Note that thecode is written to reflect Zaliznjak?s system.
The main goal has not been ele-gance and economy of representation.
For theoretically-driven inheritancerepresentations of Russian morphology using DATR see Corbett and Fraser(1993), Fraser and Corbett (1995),  and Brown (1998).NOUN:<> == NOMINAL<mor suffix pl dat> == ?
?<mor suffix pl instr> == ??
?<mor suffix pl loc> == ?
?.NOUN_M:<> == NOUN<syn gender> == masculine<syn animacy> == inanimate.NOUN_M_1A:<> == NOUN_M<mor suffix sg nom> == Null<mor suffix sg gen> == ?<mor suffix sg dat> == ?<mor suffix sg acc> =="<mor suffix sg nom>"<mor suffix sg instr> == ?
?<mor suffix sg loc> == ?<mor suffix pl nom> == ?<mor suffix pl gen> == ?
?<mor suffix pl acc> =="<mor suffix pl nom>".Here, NOMINAL defines the morphotactics of Rus-sian nominals (nouns and adjectives), comprising astem followed by a suffix that realizes the morpho-logical features.
NOUN inherits this definition anddefines three plural suffixes that are generallyshared between nouns, NOUN_M adds specific syn-tactic features and finally NOUN_M_1A fills out therest of the possible suffixes.
Notice that <stem>is not defined in this theory ?
it will be determinedon a per-lexical entry basis from the automaticallygenerated entries described below.
Notice also thesyncretic definitions for suffixes associated withsg acc and pl acc in terms of their nominativecounterparts for inanimate nouns ?
for a more de-tailed discussion of the techniques used for repre-senting such a syncretism, see Corbett and Fraser(1993:131) and Brown (1998:154-155).Classes of feminine and neuter nouns are han-dled similarly; for feminine nouns, eight types andnine different stress patterns are identified,whereas for neuter nouns eight types and six stresspatterns are distinguished.
In addition, most ofthese types are found with both animate and in-animate nouns, and in the DATR theory, two nounclasses are distinguished for each type occurringwith both animate and inanimate nouns.
In totalNOMINALNOUNNOUN_M NOUN_MO NOUN_F .
.
.NOUN_M_1Aabout 100 different noun classes are distinguishedper gender in the DATR theory.In order to make use of this theory, a lexical en-try needs to inherit from the node representing itsnoun class and provide the specific morphotacticelements associated with the class.
So for example,a possible definition for ??????
'lamp shade'might be:??????
:<> == NOUN_M_1A<stem> == ?????
?.From this definition, plus the preceding examplefragment, the standard inference rules of DATRallow all the relevant inflectional forms to be de-rived:??????
:<mor sg nom> = ?????
?<mor sg gen> = ??????
?<mor sg dat> = ??????
?<mor sg acc> = ?????
?<mor sg instr> = ??????
?
?<mor sg loc> = ??????
?<mor pl nom> = ??????
?<mor pl gen> = ??????
?
?<mor pl dat> = ??????
?
?<mor pl acc> = ??????
?<mor pl instr> = ??????
??
?<mor pl loc> = ??????
?
?.Note that stress is not currently indicated in thederived forms.
Our research involves the morpho-syntactic analysis of written text which generallydoes not mark stress.
However, as the distinctionsrelated to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977)have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress pat-terns can easily be used in our analysis of syncre-tism and frequency.2.3 Automatic generation of lexical en-triesIn its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents eachlexical entry as a text string of the sort given herefor the word ??????
'lamp shade':??????
0101 ????<??
?
1?Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation formof the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated withstress information, the fourth is gender/animacyinformation and the fifth morphological type.However, inevitably, many of the entries aremore complex than this in various ways:1.
Entries can spread over several lines,requiring textual concatenation of just theparts following the line identifier informa-tion to build the complete entry.2.
Where inflectional class does not corre-spond to gender/animacy, it may be speci-fied separately between angle brackets.
Forexample, ???????
??
<??
3*?>?grandfather?
is a masculine noun whichdeclines as a feminine noun of type 3*A.3.
Alternative values for stress patterns andsometimes classes may be present betweensquare brackets.4.
Additional annotations indicate secondlocative, second genitive, pluralia tantum,irregular forms, etc.5.
Additional comments may be present en-closed in parentheses.6.
Other punctuation (commas etc.)
may ormay not be present.In order to deliver lexical entry information in theform required by the hand-crafted theory, this dataneeds to be parsed and interpreted into the kind offormat we saw above.
A standard approach to thistask is to use regular expression search and substi-tute commands to incrementally rewrite the datastrings into a more uniform format and ultimatelyinto the required input.
However, DATR itself alsoprovides powerful string-rewriting functionality,particularly suited for dealing with awkward ex-ceptional cases, but less efficient for more routinerewriting.The approach we have taken strikes a balancebetween these two technologies.
Initially we useregular expression rewriting to achieve a basicparse of the input data: joining multiple lines to-gether, removing duplicate spaces, isolating vari-ous bracketed expressions, parsing the remainingfields and finally mapping into a DATR definitionfor each entry.
However this DATR definition isvery surface-oriented ?
little more than a basicsegmentation of the input data.
This process can becarried out completely automatically with a fairlyhigh accuracy.
But in order to link such entries tothe core morphological classes, further interpreta-tion of the data fields identified is necessary, andthis is achieved dynamically in DATR.For example, a typical simple lexical entry is thelexeme ????????????
?female aristocrat?.
Itsentry in Zaliznjak is:????????????
0101 ????????<????
??
3*?In the first phase of processing, this is mapped viaregular expression search and substitute into aDATR node definition as follows:Z-????????????
:<> == ZALNODE<index> == 30<src txt> == ' ... '<src cit> == '????????????
'<src str> == '????????<????
'<src gen> == '??
'<src cls> == '3*?
'.This node is an instance of the predefined nodeZALNODE with index number 30 (meaning simplythat it was the 30th node to be processed in thisbatch).
The <src txt> feature (omitted due tolack of space) is the whole original source string,and the other features provide the key componentsof the entry (cit ?
citation, str ?
stressed, gen ?gender/animacy, cls ?
class).This is the ?surface level?
representation of thelexical entry.
The DATR node ZALNODE inter-prets this information to define implicitly a ?deep?representation as required by the morphologicalclasses, roughly equivalent to this:Z-????????????
:<> == NOUN_FO_3*A<root_begin> == ?????????
?<root_end> == ?.Here, the gender/animacy and class informationhave been combined (and transliterated to Latinscript) to determine the declension class for thisform.
The stem forms for this class have been de-termined from the citation form (the morphotacticspecification for NOUN_FO_3*A indicates whatcomponents are required ?
different from the sim-pler NOUN_M_1A case above, to allow for the pos-sible insertion of a fleeting vowel).ZALNODE does not actually create a new nodedefinition for the deep representation.
Rather, ap-propriate values for deep features are calculateddynamically when the declension class code re-quests them, by rewriting and transforming thevalues provided by the surface form definitions.The overall effect is that, just as we saw previ-ously, the declension class definitions can use thisinformation to provide the syntax and all the in-flected forms for this word:Z-????????????
:<syn gender> = feminine<syn animacy> = animate<mor sg nom> = ??????????
?
?<mor sg gen> = ??????????
?
?<mor sg dat> = ??????????
?
?<mor sg acc> = ??????????
?
?<mor sg instr> = ??????????
?
?
?<mor sg loc> = ??????????
?
?<mor pl nom> = ??????????
?
?<mor pl gen> = ??????????
?
?<mor pl dat> = ??????????
?
?
?<mor pl acc> = ??????????
?
?<mor pl instr> = ??????????
?
??
?<mor pl loc> = ??????????
?
?
?.For most of these forms the inflection follows thevalue of <root_begin> and <root_end>.Notice, however, that in the genitive and accusa-tive plural forms, a fleeting vowel, ?
in this case, isinserted between these two components.An example of a more complex lexical entry is??????
'soldier' which is a masculine animatenoun of type 5*A.
This noun has a fleeting vowelwhich appears in the nominative singular ??????
(phonologically armejec).
The writing system alsoindicates the presence of the phoneme /j/ by theuse of ?
in the other case and number combina-tions.
To deal with this allomorphy, the DATRnode ZALNODE introduces two values for<root_begin> in the ?deep?
representation ofthis lexical entry, one which is used in the nomina-tive singular, i.e.
???
?, and one which is used forall other cases, i.e.
?????.
The ?deep?
representa-tion for ??????
looks roughly like this:Z-??????
:<> == NOUN_MO_5*A<root_begin 1> == ???
?<root_begin> == ????
?<root_end> == ?.3 The technical frameworkThe key technical challenge of this exercise wasactually rather mundane: we needed to find an en-vironment or set of environments that would allowus to do all the processing required (manual edit-ing, regular expression search and substitute,DATR compilation and dumping) with data thatincluded both Latin and Cyrillic script.
In addition,we wanted the resources we created to be maxi-mally reusable in other contexts, so a solution inline with agreed standards was highly desirable.To achieve these goals, we adopted Unicode asthe standard representation for all our data, andidentified or adapted tools to work with data in thatform.
Furthermore we used the simplest encodingof Unicode in data files, the ?ucs2?
encoding,which stores each 16 bit Unicode character simplyas two bytes of data.
This is not as compact asother encodings (such as ?utf8?)
but is supportedby a wider range of applications, in particular Mi-crosoft Wordpad.3.1 A Unicode version of ZaliznjakIt is a fairly straightforward task to convert thetransliteration used in the electronic form of Zal-iznjak to Unicode Cyrillic, using Microsoft Wordmacros.
Disambiguation of the hard and soft signsis required for the first field, (the index word field),as the + character is used for both symbols.
How-ever, the third field differentiates the hard and softsign and, as the number of lexical items writtenwith a hard sign is not great, it is a trivial task tocheck these.
The resulting files are then saved asplain text (ie ?ucs2?)
Unicode files.3.2 DATR and UnicodeThe DATR compiler used for this project was theSussex/Brighton DATR compiler, which is writtenin Prolog.
The DATR compiler inherits its charac-ter-level processing from the underlying Prologcompiler, so in order to process Unicode DATR itwas simply necessary to run it in a Prolog systemcapable of handling Unicode, and modify itslightly to detect when it was given a Unicode fileas input.
This was achieved using Poplog Prolog,3plus a customized version of Sussex/BrightonDATR (soon to be released as version 2.10).
Thisversion also includes new support for batch modeprocessing of DATR theories and a number ofcompiler enhancements for compiling largerDATR theories.3.3  Editing and search and substitute inUnicodeUnicode files stored in ?ucs2?
encoding can beconveniently viewed and edited using MicrosoftWord or Wordpad, the latter being more straight-forward for the simple text-editing requirements ofmost of the data files involved here.
The automaticrewriting of Zaliznjak entries required a more so-phisticated regular expression engine, which weobtained by adapting the Poplog editor?s regularexpression functionality to work with Unicode.These functions are particularly powerful in allow-ing multi-line regular expression matching, so thatone can match patterns spanning several lines(such as Zaliznjak data continuation lines) and re-write them to a single line.
Limited manual editingof Unicode using the Poplog editor is also possi-ble: it can manipulate arbitrary Unicode data, butits ability to display non-Latin data is platform de-pendent, and on our platform (Windows 2000) allthe Cyrillic characters were displayed as ??
?.4 Current status and future workThe system described in this paper is still verymuch work-in-progress.
The core technologies and3 See http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html.
Unicodesupport is only available in version 15.53, although currently it is completelyundocumented.structures of the approach have been developedand validated as a viable approach.
Population andvalidation of the data is an on-going process, thecurrent state of which can be summarized as fol-lows:1.
The hand-crafted DATR theory for Zalizn-jak?s morphological classes has been com-pleted for the noun classes, with adjectiveclasses next to be done.
Other classes arelower priority for the present project.2.
Automatic compilation of all 98729Zanliznjak entries into ?surface?
DATRnodes is complete but not validated.3.
Processing of a sample set containing 2062entries has been undertaken with thefollowing (not fully validated) results:No.
of Zaliznjak entries 2062 100%No.
of DATR nodes  2000 97%Nodes identified as nouns 1192 60%Nouns  successfully classi-fied1066 89%Principal areas for further development include:1.
Completion and validation of noun entries2.
Extension to adjectives (and possiblyverbs)3.
Integration of data from the manually vali-dated lexicon of 1500 most frequentnouns, to improve accuracy, particular forirregular forms.4.
Development of a lemmatizer and taggerfor Russian using this data.The last point here deserves further expansion.
Aswe discussed in the introduction, the DATR encod-ing of Zaliznjak is in part the first step towardslemmatization and tagging technology for Russian.We distinguish lemmatization, that is identifyingall possible lemmas (plus morphosyntactic fea-tures) for a word, which can be carried out on theword in isolation, from tagging, that is, identifyingthe most likely lemma (plus features) for a word incontext.
The primary aim of the project of whichthis work is a part is to explore ambiguity in lem-matization and its relationship to frequency.
Forthis a high quality lemmatizer is essential.In principle, once we have a complete set of in-flected forms, we could automatically compile itinto a lemmatizer.
However such a lemmatizerwould be extremely cumbersome to produce anduse, contain much redundancy and be quite inca-pable of coping with unknown forms.
The ap-proach we intend to take will exploit the hand-crafted components of the framework to the full,using them to construct recognisers for suffixes(and for verbs, prefixes) and identify potentialroots, and then using the full lexicon to filter andvalidate the resulting candidate analyses (we ex-pect the recognition process to overgenerate solu-tions).
This will be more compact, probably faster,and able to cope with unknown root forms.Beyond such a lemmatizer, we are currently in-vestigating how to combine inheritance-based lexi-cal representation with traditional part-of-speechtagging technology, and hope to apply this work tothe Zaliznjak data, to deliver a high quality de-tailed morphosyntactic tagger for Russian texts.On the more technological front, current plansinclude:1.
Consolidating Unicode support in DATR(extending to the Sicstus Prolog version,supporting other file encodings).2.
Packaging key technologies for wider use.3.
Delivering the whole Zaliznjak lexicon asan XML-based DATR database.5 ConclusionsZaliznjak?s dictionary, both in its book form andelectronic version, has proved an invaluable tool.In this paper we have shown how the classes fromZaliznjak can be mapped into a DATR representa-tion.
This representation is a structured lexiconfrom which we can derive all of the associatedforms for the entries in Zaliznjak.
As well as con-stituting a valuable computation resource for Rus-sian in its own right, our next step will be to usethis lexical database as the foundation for highquality lemmatization and morphosyntactic tag-ging software for Russian text.AcknowledgementsThe research reported here is supported by theEconomic and Social Research Council  (UK) un-der grant RES-000-23-0082 'Paradigms in Use'.Their support is gratefully acknowledged.AvailabilityAt the time of writing, the Zaliznjak data files arestill work in progress, and the tool adaptations (toDATR, Poplog etc.)
are still custom extensions.However, it is our intention to make these re-sources publically available, as far as is consistentwith existing licences etc., in the near future.ReferencesAnciaux, Michele.
