DLT - AN INDUSTRIAL  R & D PROJECT FORMULT IL INGUAL MTToon WITKAMBSO/Research, Postbus 8348, NL-3503 RH Utrecht, The Netherlandswitkam@dltl.uucpAbstractAn overview of the DLT (Distributed Language Translation) projectis given.
This project is aimed at a new, multilingual MT system inthe 1990s, which uses Esperanto asan internal interlingua.
Thesystem's ,architectural features, current progress and projectorganization are dealt with.1.
In t roduct ionDLT (Distributed Language Translation).
is the name of aprinciple,a design philosophy and a project.
Within the area of MT, itrepresents another approach for steering between thehazards of low-quality output, endless prolongation ofresearch and development time, restriction to narrowly-bounded subject fields, the geometric cost expansion whena new language is added, etc.DLT is a concentrated high-tech effort to attain a productline of language translation modules in the 1990s.Together, these modules will constitute an interactive,knowledge-based, multilingual translation system, perfecdysuited for operation on networked esk-top equipment.DLT was conceived in 1979, in an environment with nohistorical ties to MT whatsoever.
After patents had beenapplied for in 14 countries, the first publication followed atthe conference on"New Systems and Services in Telecommunications" inLiege \[ 1980\].In 1982, the EEC granted aquarter of a million guilders fora DLT Feasibility Study, which was completed in 1983.
Aremarkable f ature of the DLT design, highlighted in thisstudy, was the use of Esperanto as intermediate language,with its own lexicon.
This meant he adoption of an overallinterlingual architecture, the most ambitious structureknown for an MT system.At the same time, the introduction ofEsperanto into the MTscene of the 1980s aroused a lot of skepticism andprejudice.
As it happens, this semi-artificial language(invented by an ophthalmo-logist towards the end of thenineteenth century) is not usually considered a respectableobject of study among professional linguists.2.
Des ign ph i losophyThe research team at BSO considers Esperanto a valuabletool in language technology, and has motivated its use asthe DLT pivot on rigorous ystems engineering grounds:- an overall interlingual rchitecture, i.e.
an MT process of2 main steps (instead of 3) fits extremely well into theoutside operating environment, which consists of 'senders'and 'receivers' linked by a communications etwork; theinterlingua (or Intermediate Language) is the 'semi-product'passed over the network, and should be independent of anysource or target language in the system;- the knowledge-based component of the translationprocess,the world-knowledge inferencing system for resolvingambiguities i  essentially language-independent andcantherefore ntirely be built in the interlingua; serving amultilingual system, this is an important economy-of-scaleconsideration;- long-term development and maintenance of a complextranslation and world knowledge system is a task that canonly succeed with perfect man-machine interfaces for thesystem engineers; linguists, lexicographers, terminologistsand other specialists must be offered quick and easy accessto the heart of the translation machinery; this calls for aninterlingua that is directlY,legible;at the same time, the interlingua should belexicologically autonomous and well-defined, the formereliminating the needfor re-paraphrasing in other languages, the latterbeing a prerequisite for distributed system development(language teams working to and from one commoninterlingua); Esperanto meets these requirements.3.
Prototype const ruct ionIn 1984, BSO set up a plan for a 6-year research anddevelopment project (75 person-years at the cost of 18million guilders), aimed ata  DLT prototype capable oftranslating atleast one language pair (English-French).
Thisplan received the su0port of the Ministry of EconomicAffairs of the Netherlands, which granted an innovationsubsidy of 8 million guilders.
The first half of this6-year schedule has now been completed.A first prototype of DLT was shown to the press inDecember 1987.
Though operating only slowly as yet, witha small vocabulary (2000 English words) and a restrictedgrammar, this laboratory model shows the variousmonolingual and bilingual processing steps of DLT inproper sequence \[see also Fig.
1\]:1.
Exhaustive parsing of the English source text.
Twodifferent parser implementations have been realized in thesearch for the fastest formalism: one is based on ATNs andBSO's graphic software environment (on SUN 3/50workstations) developed for setting up, testing andoptimizing ATNs, the other is based on APSG and thePARSPAT software system from the University ofAmsterdam \[Van der Steen, 1987\].The parsing process in DLT is breadth-first, syntax-only, and delivers dependency (not constituency) trees.2.
Surface translation (first hail).
Contrastive syntacticrules between English and Esperanto are applied here.
Thissystem of bilingual rules (250 at present) is based upondependency grammar formalizations of both languages.The methodo-logical framework has been inspired by thework of the French linguist Tesniere and iscomprehensively described in \[Schubert, 1987\].
Semanticconsiderations are disregarded systematically at this stage.The result is a (sometimes large) number of 'formallypossible' parallel translations.7563.
Main semantic analysis, entirely carried out in theIntermediate Language, by searching through aknowledgebase of some 75.000 (present status) semantically relatedEsperanto word pairs, and by applying text-grammaticalprinciples of cohesion etc.
to the intermediate stage of thet~rauslated text \[Papegaaij, 1986 and 1988\].This automatic disambiguation system, written inQuintus PROLOG, now largely serves as a rating (pre-ordering) of parallel surface translations, prior to thedisambiguation dialogue which follows it.
The DLT designoffers a long.
term perspective for steady improvement ofthis wobabitistic component, ultimately by machinelearuing.4.
Disambigu_ation dialogue.
The user is prompted to makea choice out of the possible interpretations li ted on thescreen.
Note that these are parallel surface translations,backotranslated ('paraphrased') into the source language.For the user~ the disambiguation dialogue is a strictlymonolingual affair, and free of linguistic jargon.
In thepresent realization of the DLT prototype, mainly lexicalambiguities can be displayed.5.
Surface tr~nslation (..second half).
As Step 2 above, butnow between tile Intermediate Language and French.
Some500 contrastive syntactic rules have been implemented sofar.
Though the proliferation of parallel translations i  lessat this side of the translation process (due to the syntacticunambiguity of Esperanto and its lack of homonyms), it isnot absent.
If the target lauguage happens to have a morerefined "cutting..up- of-reality" in some concept area (likethe proverbial 10 words for 'snow' in Eskimo), paralleltranslations will result.
All the results of this step are in theform of dependency trees.6.
Additiomfl semantics.
TL-specific selection criteria areapplied to select he right word.
But because these criteriaare knowledge-based (we are not talking of idiomaticphenomena), they are restated in terms of the IL, and theselection process is carried out on the intermediate stage ofthe translated text, using the Esperanto knowledge bankagain, if the context does not provide enough clues, adefault choic~ (e.g.
the least specific word for 'snow') willbe made.
In contrast o the source language half of thesystem, there is no possibility for human intervention here.7.
~s i j .
of the target sentence.
In this tree-to-stringconversion, the TL-specific word order is determined(including the applicatkm of elision and contraction rules).4.
Project outlookBSO is now in the process of preparing for the next phaseof the project (budgeted at 12 million guilders), in whichthe emphasis will be on large-scale dictionary andknowledge-base expansion, and relaxation of grammarrestrictions.Work done on DLT in the past 5 years confilans thefeasibility of its architecture and its instrumental use ofEsperanto.
Some of the modifications toEsperanto thoughtnecessary \[Witkam, 1983\] in its pivotal MT functionappeared to be unnecessary aswork on DLT progressed,i.e.
the Intermediate Language is closer to Esperanto nowthan it looked like in the beginning.
Criticizers' predictionsthat the ill_, would keep changing and would drift furtherand further away from Esperanto, have not been borne out.The essence of DLT is not so much an attempt at anunambiguous intedingua, but rather: a split of the overallITanslation sequence into a form part and a ~ part, inwhich file former is arrangedas a .~ouLb.~.
:dir_L?_~ and the latter as an interlingual /VII"pl'oc;ess.,The doublerdirect process is the surface translation referredto above (Steps 2 and 5), which could be looselycharacterized as ".dumb syntax".
The interlingual processcorresponds Io Steps 3 and 6 above, and contains all the8e_r~tics (including knowledge-based inferencing).Meanwhile, the share of IL-based or IL-directed work inthe overall translation sequence - form part as well ascontent part - has increased considerably, compared to theinitial design of 1982 \[see Fig.
2\].
In the form part, whichis bilingual and purely syntactic, the Esperanto 1L plays therole of "metataxis partner" for every source and targetlanguage ('metataxis' is tile contrastive-syntactictransformation f dependency trees).
The content part ismonolingual, i.e.
the semantics i a question of IL-only.
Itgoes withont saying that such a design can only succeed byvirtue of the fact that Esperanto is a well defined languageon its own, with a well defined syntax and lexicon, andwith the help of project staff luent in or at least conversantwith that language.The logistics of DLT development draw heavily upon theexistence of Esperanto resources in the widest sense:linguists with Esperanto training, Esperantists with degreesin languages or with extensive translator's experience,corpora of moderu Esperanto texts, etc.
Timely availabilityof these resources in sufficient quantity and qualitydemands ome special organizational nd promotionalactivity from the DLT entrepreneurs.This means crossing international borders, including theborder between EEC and COMECON countries.
EastEuropean countries have a relatively large base ofEsperanto speakers, and much on-going activity.
TheBudapest Eotvos Lorand University has a chair inEsperanto.
In Poland, a new Esperanto center connectedwith the University of Bjalistok has been founded in 1987.In Bulgaria an international training center exists, and inl~'ague an International Center for Esperanto Terminologyhas recently been established.The challenge of the DLT project is therefore as much anorganizational s a technological challenge.
Cooperationwith Hungarian, Finnish and Czech linguists has alreadybegun, and preparatory work has been arranged withcollaborators inEast Asian countries.
Diversity of languagetypes is a deliberate aimfor the multilingual DLT system of the 1990s, and tiledesigned architecture makes it technically feasible.
It can behoped that, against the background of 'glasnost' and'perestrojka', fruitful and effective East-West cooperationmay add to the success of a system for international use andof general interest to the growing community ofcomputational linguistics tudents and researchers.REFERENCESPapegaaij, B.C.
