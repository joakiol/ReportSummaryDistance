4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617 Taiwan (R.O.C)chanchiah@gmail.comAbstractOne of the main approaches to extract multi-word units is the frequency threshold approach, but the waythis approach considers dispersion data still leaves a lot to be desired.
This study adopts Gries?s (2008)dispersion measure to extract trigrams from a Chinese corpus, and the results are compared with thoseof the frequency threshold approach.
It is found that the overlap between the two approaches is not verylarge.
This demonstrates the necessity of taking dispersion data more seriously and the dynamic natureof lexical representations.
Moreover, the trigrams extracted in the present study can be used in a widerange of language resources in Chinese.1 IntroductionIn the past decades, multi-word units have been of great interest not only to corpus linguists but also tocognitive linguists and psycholinguists.
It has been empirically demonstrated that multi-word units arepervasive in our languages (cf.
Wray and Perkins, 2000), and they are considered psychologically realwhen it is found that a language learner starts with formulaic phrases that serve specific functions (e.g.,Ellis, 2003; Tomasello, 2003).
One of the current approaches to extract multi-word units is thefrequency threshold approach (cf.
Wei and Li, 2013).The frequency threshold approach reflects the argument that frequently used items are moreentrenched in our mind.
While many have recognized that frequency data are more useful whencomplemented with dispersion data (e.g., Juilland et al., 1970), the way the frequency thresholdapproach considers the dispersion of a multi-word unit still leaves a lot to be desired.
For example,when automatically extracting multi-word units in English, Gray and Biber (2013) simply set adispersion threshold, i.e., occurring in at least five corpus texts.Therefore, the present study aims to probe more deeply into the interaction between the frequencydata and the dispersion data of multi-word units.
Both a frequency-based set of multi-word units and adispersion-based set are automatically extracted from a Chinese corpus, and the two sets are compared.The present study adopts a more scientific method to compute the dispersion of a multi-word unit, i.e.,the DP value (Gries, 2008).
This method is argued to be more flexible, simple, extendable, andsensitive than previous methods (Gries, 2008:425-426).
Note that given the limited resources, thepresent study focuses on three-word units (trigrams for short, hereafter).The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the method of the present study.
Section 3presents the results.
Section 4 is a general discussion of the findings and the implications.
Section 5highlights the contributions of the findings.2 MethodThe corpus for the present study is the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese (theSinica Corpus, hereafter).1 The fourth edition contains 11,245,853 tokens.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/99This study adopted a fully inductive approach to identify trigrams in Chinese.
A computer programrun in R automatically retrieved trigrams in the Sinica Corpus.
Each trigram did not cross apunctuation boundary in a written text or a turn boundary in a spoken text.
Then, the raw occurrenceof each trigram was counted, and the raw occurrence was also normalized to the relative frequency inone million words.
A frequency threshold was set to be 5 occurrences in one million words, and 1,279trigrams passed the threshold.
For each of them, the dispersion value was calculated.2Regarding the dispersion value, the present study adopted Gries?s (2008) measure.
First, the corpuswas roughly evenly divided into ten parts.
Next, the raw occurrence of each trigram in each part wascounted.
Then, the dispersion value was calculated as shown in Table 1.
Take the trigram shi yi ge ?bea CLASSIFIER?, for example.
Given that the first part of the corpus (1,081,955 tokens altogether)accounts for 9.6% of all the corpus data, the raw occurrences of shi yi ge in the first corpus part shouldalso account for 9.6% of its overall occurrences.
However, the observed frequency of shi yi ge in thefirst part (405/2,931 = 13.8%) was found to be slightly higher than its expected frequency.
Theabsolute difference for each corpus part (shown in the third column) was summed up (shown in thefourth column), and the sum was divided by 2.
The figure in the fifth column was the dispersion valuefor the trigram shi yi ge.
The dispersion value always falls between 0 and 1: the lower the value is, themore evenly dispersed the trigram is in the corpus.ExpectedPercentage(A)ObservedPercentage(B)AbsoluteDifference(C) = (A)-(B)Sum ofAbsoluteDifferences(D)Divided by 2(E) = (D)/21,081,955/11,245,853= 0.096(9.6%)405/2,931= 0.138(13.8%)|0.096 - 0.138|= 0.0421,018,642/11,245,853= 0.091202/2,931= 0.069|0.091 - 0.069|= 0.0221,163,099/11,245,853= 0.103283/2,931= 0.097|0.103 - 0.097|= 0.0061,023,536/11,245,853= 0.091388/2,931= 0.132|0.091 - 0.132|= 0.0411,050,833/11,245,853= 0.093408/2,931= 0.139|0.093 - 0.139|= 0.0461,214,233/11,245,853= 0.108224/2,931= 0.076|0.108 - 0.076|= 0.0321,132,756/11,245,853= 0.101287/2,931= 0.098|0.101 - 0.098|= 0.0031,185,658/11,245,853= 0.105164/2,931= 0.056|0.105 - 0.056|= 0.0491,200,826/11,245,853= 0.107313/2,931= 0.107|0.107 - 0.107|= 01,174,315/11,245,853= 0.104257/2,931= 0.088|0.104 - 0.088|= 0.0160.257 0.1285Table 1.
Computation of the dispersion value of the trigram shi yi ge ?be a CLASSIFIER?.After the dispersion value for each of the 1,279 trigrams was calculated, the top 300 trigrams in thefrequency-based list and the top 300 trigrams in the dispersion-based list were further analyzed1 The fourth edition of the Sinica Corpus is currently available at http://asbc.iis.sinica.edu.tw/.
For more information aboutthe Sinica Corpus, refer to http://app.sinica.edu.tw/kiwi/mkiwi/98-04.pdf.2 The present study aims to compare frequency-based and dispersion-based trigrams, and the best way would be to computethe dispersion value for all the trigrams automatically extracted from the corpus.
This, however, seems to be too difficultbecause this approach could be resource-intensive.
Therefore, the present study set a frequency threshold to obtain acomputationally reasonable number of trigrams, and computed the dispersion value for each trigram that passed thatfrequency threshold.
Actually, the frequency threshold of the present study is relatively low.100manually.3 Each of them were then manually coded based on the form.

Categories for trigrams.3 ResultsThe total numbers of trigram types at different frequency thresholds (per one million words) arepresented in Table 3.
The following discussions will center around trigrams that occur five or moretimes per one million words.Table 3.

AsFigure 2 shows, the majority of trigrams are quite well-dispersed across the corpus (i.e., most of thedispersion values are lower than 0.4).Figure 2.
The distribution of the dispersion values of the 1,279 trigrams.When zooming in to examine the top 300 trigrams in the frequency-based list and the top 300trigrams in the dispersion-based list, we can find that there is an overlap of 126 trigrams (only 42%)between the two list.

The category distributions of the top 300 trigrams in the frequency-based list, the top 300trigrams in the dispersion-based list, and the 126 trigrams in the overlap.4 DiscussionOverall, whether from the frequency-based perspective or from the dispersion-based perspective,content word trigrams are the most dominant.
This is not too surprising, for this category covers awide range of word classes (i.e., nouns, adjectives, and adverbs).
In Chinese, finite trigrams are alsofrequent and well-dispersed, perhaps because the finite serves many interpersonal metafunctions (i.e.,expressing the polarity of a sentence/utterance) (Thompson, 1996).
In this category, shi ?be?
is themost frequent.
The main difference between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-basedapproach is that the former extracts more function word trigrams, while the latter extracts moreincomprehensibly incomplete trigrams.Additionally, as shown in Table 4, the overlap between the two approaches is not very large (i.e.,126/300 = 42%).
Now, consider Table 5.102Top n trigrams in the two lists Overlap300 126/300 = 42%500 262/500 =  52.4%700 438/700 =  62.6%1,000 798/1,000 = 79.8%1,279 1,279/1,279 = 100%Table 5.
The overlap between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-based approach.Since the trigrams in the two lists are the same, the overlap should be getting larger as n is gettinglarger.
However, even when n reaches 700, the overlap between the two approaches is only slightlymore than half.
This suggests that when a certain type number is set (e.g., 300, 500, or 700), thefrequency-based approach and the dispersion-based approach can extract quite different sets oftrigrams.Some may argue that the frequency-based approach is more useful because it extracts fewerincomprehensibly incomplete trigrams (cf.
Table 4).
On the other hand, we can also see the dispersionvalue as an ancillary measure to the relative frequency, just as the standard deviation is usuallypresented whenever a mean is presented.
Frequencies can be regarded as an important dimension ofthe sum of one?s linguistic experience (cf.
Bybee, 2006), and dispersion data should also be consideredso.
Items, whether single words or multi-word units, that achieve a high frequency and arewell-dispersed across the corpus should be much more entrenched in the mental lexicon, for theirfrequent occurrences are ubiquitous, not just in certain text types.
These items should deserve moreattention from linguists and may be more useful in a language resource.Moreover, the findings of the present study have demonstrated the dynamic nature of lexicalrepresentations.
When different measures (e.g., the relative frequency, the dispersion value) are used,the ranking of a trigram may change dramatically.
If the association measure is also taken into accountor different measures are integrated in a certain way, another picture of trigrams in Chinese mayemerge.
This echoes Biber?s (2009) suggestion that in the extraction of multi-word units, nomethodology should be considered to be correct.
That is to say, different sets of multi-word unitsextracted by different approaches can all be useful in one way or another and reflective of someaspects of our cognition.
However, those ranking high in all the approaches may be at the core of ourmental lexicon.The implications of a list of trigrams (or other multi-word units) in Chinese can be pinpointed asfollows.
First, most dictionaries in Chinese compile words, but a dictionary of multi-word units inChinese can also be of great use.
For example, the trigram you yi ge ?have one CLASSIFER?
is usuallyused to introduce a new topic in discourse, and this needs to be included in a dictionary in Chinese.Second, such useful sequences as you yi ge can also be included in teaching materials for languagelearners.
Third, we can try to use automatically extracted sequences to build a language/lexicalresource like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
In such a resource (i.e., perhaps something like the Net ofMulti-word Units), multi-word units in Chinese can be organized according to words or characterscontained in them or even according to their discourse functions (and perhaps in some other creativeways), and lexical relations between multi-word units can be coded.5 ConclusionThe contribution of the present study is twofold.
Methodologically speaking, this study adopts a moresensitive dispersion measure (i.e., Gries, 2008) instead of setting an arbitrary dispersion threshold (e.g.,occurring in at least five corpus files), and demonstrates that dispersion data are needed in theautomatic extraction of multi-word units since those ranking high in a frequency-based list are notnecessarily at the top of a dispersion-based list.
It is argued that the dispersion of a multi-word unit,together with its frequency, can contribute to the entrenchment of the item in the mental lexiconbecause the dispersion measure reveals where a language user is confronted with the item.
Practicallyspeaking, trigrams in the overlap between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-basedapproach may be at the core of the Chinese lexicon and can serve as a point of departure for futurelinguistic studies and resources in Chinese.103The present study can be extended in the following directions.
First, some evaluations frompsycholinguistic experiments are needed to further examine the role of frequency data and dispersiondata in the mental lexicon.
Second, the same method can be adopted to automatically extractmulti-word units in different genres, and the results will be helpful for genre studies.ReferencesAlison Wray and Michael R. Perkins.
