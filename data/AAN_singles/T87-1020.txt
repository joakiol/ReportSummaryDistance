Towards a Semantic  Theory  of DiscourseC.
Raymond PerraultArtificial Intelligence Center andCenter for the Study of Language and InformationSRI InternationalI don't feel comfortable trying to building reliable, well-understood NLP systemswithout providing a semantics for their "mental state," including the data structuresthey encode.
One step in that direction is a semantics of sentences, for example thatof Montague.
However, to handle extended discourses, the methods ofmodel-theoretic semantics need to be extended in (at least) three directions.
First,anaphora nd deixis require that the interpretation (of phrases, sentences, and entirediscourses) should be made sensitive to context, both linguistic and physical.
Second,non-declarative s ntences must be treated uniformly with declarative ones.
Finally,it should be possible to make room in the semantics for interpretation constraintsbased on the subject-matter of the discourse and on communication itself.
I'mthinking particularly of the kind of inferences typically captured computationally bthe use of scripts, plans, prototypes, etc.
Typically these constraints oninterpretations have been kept outside the realm of semantics, and might even betaken .to be the distinguishing characteristics of a separate pragrnatics component.I'd like to suggest hat we already have available many of the necessary elements fora context-sensitive theory of discourse, although substantial work still needs to bedone to bring the pieces together and to build implementations faithful to thesemantics.Several proposals have now been made to account for possible relations betweenanaphora nd antecedents within and across sentences, including treatments of theinteraction between quantifiers and anaphors \[W, K, H, B\].
Kamp and Heim bothintroduce an intermediate l v.,el of representation f sentences and give a semantics tothat level while Barwise's syntax-directed interpretation relation also takes asarguments input and output contexts which are partial assignments of values tovariables.
However, none of these treatments takes into consideration the domainconstraints, perhaps better described as preferences, or those discussed by Grosz etal.
\[G\] under the name ofcentering.I used to think of the interpretation ofnon-declarative s ntences as being outside thedomain of semantics; it wasn't clear how semantics was compatible with theattribution of illocutionary force (or speech act type) to utterances.
But a uniformsemantics for different sentence types is possible if one takes the interpretation ofanutterance (of any number of sentences) to be a relation, determined by mood,95intonation, and propositional contet~t, between the joint mental state of theparticipants before and after the utterance.
The speech acts (illocutionary andperlocutionary) applicable to the utterance are then determinable asa function of theinitial mental state of the speaker (in the case ofillocutionary acts, such as assert andwarn) or of both initial and final mental states ofspeaker and hearer (in the case ofperlocutionary acts, such as conoince and scare).
The beginning of such an analysiscan be found in \[PJ.
There are other good reasons for this move.
It treats utterancesas first-class actions, making it possible to use them in complex actions includingnon-linguistic acts.
It also makes it easier to show the relation between illocutionaryacts and the related intended periocutionary effects.
It also makes it possible to showwhat are the consequences of utterances which, intentionally or not, violate thenormal conventions, as is the case with ironical, indirect and insincere utterances.The key feature of the analysis is its dependence on default rules, formulated withinReiter's non-monotonic default logic \[R\].
to express the consequences of utterances,making clear that the conveyance of propositional ttitudes constituting a speech actis based on the use of utterances with certain features in mental states appropriate tothe attitudes being conveyed, but that, in general, the speaker need not be in therequisite mental state.Several other discourse constraints have been studied in the framework of variousnon-monotonic logics (e.g., presupposition \[M\], anaphora resolu.tion \[D\],conversational implicature \[d\].)
So have questions with obvious relation to.discoursesuch as plan .recognition \[KA\] and temporal reasoning IS, L\]... Script-basedreasoning should allow the defeasible inference of the existence'of various entities,including events, from the statement ofthe existence of related entities.Although non-monotonic reasoning seems to hold the key to a wide range ofdiscoursephenomena, the developments above appeal to a range of different systems: in fact,no two of the papers mentioned above use exactly the same system.
One promisingarea of unification of the various ystems is through their use of preferred models.
Itmay be useful to start with a familiar case.
In Montague grammar (based onintensional logic, a monotonic system), it is possible to specify constraints on lexicalitems (e.g.
the fact that seek is equivalent to try to find, or that the subject of seek, isextensional, or human) in a set of meaning postulates.
These postulates are used torestrict he class of models considered: a sentence s is valid iffit is true in all modelssatisfying the meaning postulates.
Similarly, various non-monotonic theories aregiven semantics by restricting the models in which they are interpreted.
McCarthy'scircumscription, for example, makes use of models in which certain predicates arerestricted to their smallest extensions; Shoham's logic of chronological ignorancedepends on what he calls chronologically maximally ignorant models, and Kautz'slogic ofplans minimises over several dimensions, including, e.g., the number of stepsin a plan.96The whole area of non-monotonic reasoning is in a state of great flux, in part becauseof the diversity of systems and the technical difficulty of arguments within andbetween the various systems \[HM\].
Nevertheless, the simple fact that no otherapproach comes close to dealing with so many of the relevant problems uggests to methat three questions hould be investigated on the way to a semantic theory ofdiscourse:?
whether other "pragmatic" problems can be couched in the same terms (e.g.,noun-noun modification, metonymy, word-sense selection),?
whether there is a general enough notion of preference to cover all thesecases,?
whether a positive answer to these questions can be translated intoprocessing algorithms.Maybe we'll know the answers at the next meeting.AcknowledgementThis paper was made possible by a gift from the Systems Developement Foundation.References\[B\] Barwise, K.J., Noun phrases, generalized quantifiers and anaphora, CSLI report86-52, 1986.\[D\] Dunin-Keplicz, B., Default reasoning in anaphora resolution, ECAI-84, 1984.\[G\] Grosz, B.J., Joshi, A.K., Weinstein, S., Providing a unified account of definitenoun phrases in discourse, ACL-21, 1983.\[HM\] Hanks, S., McDermott, D., Default reasoning, nonmonotonic logics, and theframe problem, AAAI-86, 1986.\[H\] Heim, I.
