theThe Trans fer  Phase  ofMu Mach ine  Trans  l a t  i onNakoto NAOAOJun-ichi TSUJIIDepartment of Electr ical  EngineeringKyoto UniversityKyoto, Japan 606Sys  t (.~m1 IntroductionThe interlingual approach to MT has been repeatedlyadvocated  by researchers  o r ig ina l ly  in teres ted  Jnnatura l  language unders tand ing  who take mach inetranslation to be one possible application.
However,not only the ambiguity but also the vagueness whichevery natura l  language inev i tab ly  has leads thisapproach into essent ia l  d i f f icu l t ies .
In contrast,our project,  the Mu-pro ject ,  adopts  the t rans ferapproach as the basic  f ramework  of MT.
This  paperdescribes the detailed const ruct ion  of the t ransferphase of our system from Japanese  to Engl ish, andgives some examples of problems which seem difficultto treat in the interlJngual approach.The basic design principles of the transfer phase ofour sys tem have a l ready been ment ioned  in (i) (2).Some of the pr inc ip les  wh ich  are re levant  to thetopic of this paper are:(a)Multiple Layer of Grammars(b)Multiple Layer Presentation(c) Lexicon Driven Processing(d) Form-Oriented Dictionary DescriptionThis paper a lso shows how these pr inc ip les  arerealized in the current system.2 The Construction of the Transfer PhaseThe t ransfer  phase of our system consists  of thefollowing three sub-phases (Fig.

Construction of the Transfer PhaseAnalys is  resul ts  'of input sentences  of the sourcelanguage (SL) are represented  in the fo rm ofannotated  tree structures,  f rom wh ich  one canretrieve various levels of information contained inthe input sentences.
The MTP is performed recursivelyf rom the top of the tree to the bot tom (Fig.
2).
Ateach  s tep  of the recurs ion ,  the sub-s t ruc turegoverned by a node (current node, node X ira Fig.
2)is transferr(~d to the corresponding structure of thetarget language (TL).
This phase main ly  per fo rmslexJcal tran~'{fer, that is, it chooses an appropriatetarget lexical  i tem for node X by examin ing  theannotation parts of that node and its dependent nodes(nodes  YI,..Y2,..Yn).
The se lec t ion  of a ta rgetlexical  i tem may place certa in const ra ins  on thetransfer of the dependent nodes.
These constrains areexpressed  as proper ty -va lue  pairs and added to theannotation parts of the dependent nodes, which are tobe u t i l i zed  in the subsequent  recurs ion  steps.
Forlanguage pairs  such as Japanese and Engl ish  wh ichbelong to quite different language families, however,the lexical  t ransfer  is not so s t ra ight forward.
Itoften happens that single lexical  i tems of SLcor respond to complex  (-~xpressions of TL and viceversa.
Fur thermore ,  certa in  s t ruc tura l  changes arealso required.Because the MTP recursively transfers sub-structuresgoverned by single nodes, certa in  g lobal  s t ructura ldifferences cannot be naturally treated.
Such globalchanges are deal t with by the Pre-TP and Pest-TP sub-phases (See section 7) .?Fig.

Lezlcal Transfer of an Adective(4) Co lumn C : Transfer based on Col locat ion withModif iersWe have severa l  words  of minor  par ts -o f - speech  inJapanese  wh ich  rough ly  cor respond to determiners ,quantif iers, etc.

A lmost  the same kind ofin format ion as column D is specif ied in this columnfor these words.4 The Form-Or iented Dict ionary and Lexical  Transferof VerbsWhen the node  X in Fig.
2 is a verb  or  an ad jec t ive ,the transfer g rammar  for predicates is invoked.
If itdose not exist:, the other rule in the grammar  invokesthe lex ica l  ru les  der ived  f rom the fo rm-or ienteddict ionary of the predicate (node X).
By examin ing theannotat ion parts of that node and its dependents, thelexJcal rules of a predicate may determine(\]) the trans\].ation equivalent in Engl ish(2) the deep case re lat ionship and surface ease makerof those  dependents  s t r i c t ly  governed  by thepredicate.If a Japanese  pred icate  is rea l ly  ambiguous ,  aseparate  case f rame is p rov ided  for each of itsmeanings.
The Japanese analysis g rammar  d isambiguatesthe meaning and a separate lexical entry is preparedin the bi l ingual  dictionary, i.e.
di f ferent meaningsof a predicate are treated as di f ferent lexica\], items99in the transfer phase.
However, the real prob lems int rans la t ion  is not  caused  by ~mbigu i ty  such  as th i sbut by vagueness of meaning.
When we treat a languagepa i r  such  as Japanese  and  Eng l i sh ,  it is notexcept ional  but rather usual that a verb of SL has tobe t rans la ted  in to  d i f fe rent  ta rget  lex ica li tems,  even  though the nat ive  speakers  of  SL cannotclearly real ize the meaning difference.Ex-8.

If we cons idered  them asdi f ferent meanings, the Japanese verb ' ~ '  wou ldhave p lenty  of d i f fe rent  mean ings  and be a h igh lyambiguous word.
Note that the Engl ish verb 'to wear'shou ld  be t rans la ted  into more  than  f ive d i f fe rn tJapanese  verbs  depend ing  on what  is to be worn.
'Towear  shoes', 'to wear a watch', 'to wear spectacles',etc.
shou ld  al l  be t rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .
Thesefacts show that it is impossible to establ ish the setof lex ica l  i tems of the in ter l ingua .
In our system,then, these 'translationally ambiguous' lexical i temsare treated in the transfer phase.The form-or iented dict ionary of verbs is shown inFig.
