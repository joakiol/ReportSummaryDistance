Three types of syntactic variationswere studied : permutation, expansion andsubstitution.
These syntactic variations yield otherrelations of formal and conceptual nature.
Basingon a distinction of the variation relationsaccording to the grammatical function affected ina term - head or modifier - term variants are firstclustered into connected components which are inturn clustered into classes.
These classes relatetwo or more components through variationsinvolving a change of head word, thus of topic.The graph obtained reveals the global organisationof research topics in the corpus.
A clusteringmethod has been built to compute such classes ofresearch topics.IntroductionThe importance of terms in various naturallanguage tasks such as automatic indexing,computer-aided translation, information retrievaland technology watch need no longer be proved.Terms are meaningful textual units used fornaming concepts or objects in a given field.
Paststudies have focused on building term extractiontools : TERMINO (David S. & Plante P. 1991),LEXTER (Bourigault D. 1994), ACABIT (Daille1994), FASTR (Jacquemin 1995), TERMS (KatzS.M.
& Justeson T.S.
1995).
Here, term extractionand the identification of syntactic variationrelations are considered for topic detection.Variations are changes affecting the structure andthe form of a term producing another textual unitclose to the initial one e.g.
dna amplification andamplification fingerprinting of dna.
Variations canpoint to terminological evolution and thus to thatof the underlying concept.
Topic is used in itsgrammatical sense, i.e.
the head word in a nounphrase.
In the above term, fingerprinting is thetopic (head word) and dna amplification itsproperties (modifiers).
However, a topic cannotappear by chance in specialised litterature, so thisgrammatical definition needs to be backed up byempirical evidence such as recurrence of termssharing the same head word.
We constituted a testcorpus of scientific abstracts and titles in Englishfrom the field of plant biotechnology making up---29000 words.
These texts covered publicationsmade over 13 years (1981-1993).
We focused onthree syntactic variation types occurringfrequently amongst terms : permutation,substitution and expansion (?2).
Tzoukermann E.Klavans J. and Jacquemin C. (1997) extractedmorpho-syntactic erm variants for NLP tasks suchas automatic indexing.
They accounted for a widespectrum of variation producing phenomena likethe morpho-syntactic variation involvingderivation in tree cutting and trees have been cutdown 1.We focused for the moment on terms appearing asnoun phrases (NP).
Although term variants canappear as verb phrases (VP), we believe that NPvariants reflect more terminological stability thusa real shift in topic (root hair --~ root hairdeformation) than their VP counterpart (root hairthe root hair appears deformed).
Also, ourapplication - research topic identification - beingquite sensitive, requires a careful selection of termvariants types depending on their interpretability.Examples taken from Tzoukermann etal.
(1997).564This is to avoid creating relations between termswhich could mislead the end-user, typically atechnological watcher, in his task.
For instancehow do we interpret the relation between conceptclass and class concept ?
Also, our aim is not toextract syntactic variants per se but to identifythem in order to establish meaningful relationsbetween them.1 Extracting terms from texts1.1 Morpho-syntactic featuresTerm extract ion is based on their morpho-syntactic features.
The morphological compositionof NP terms allows for a limited number ofcategories mostly nouns, adjectives and someprepositions.
Terms can appear under twosyntactic structures : compound (the specificalfalfa nodulation) or syntagmatic (the specificnodulation of alfalfa).
Since terms are used fornaming concepts and objects in a given knowledgefield, they tend to be relatively short textual unitsusually between 2-4 words though terms of longerlength occur (endogeneous duck hepatitis B virus).In this study, we fixed a word limit of 7 notconsidering determiners and prepositions.Based on these three features, morphologicalmake-up, syntactic structure and length, clausesare processed in order to extract complex termsrather than atomic ones.
The motivation behindthis approach is that complex terms reveal theassociation of concepts, hence they are morerelevant for the application we are considering.
Afine-grained term extraction strategy would isolatethe concepts and thus lose the information givenby their associations in the corpus.
For this reason,we could not consider the use of an existing termextraction tool and thus had to carry out a manualsimulation of the term extraction phase.
NPsplitting rules take into account he lexical natureof the constituent words and their raisingproperties (i.e.
derived nouns as opposed to non-derived ones).
Furthermore, following theempirical approach successfully implemented byBourigault (1994), we split complex NPs onlyafter a search as been performed in the corpus foroccurrences of their sub-segments in unambiguoussituations, i.e.
when the sub-segments are notincluded in a larger segment.
This favours theextraction of pre-conceived textual units possiblycorresponding todomain terms.
However morpho-syntactic features alone cannot verify theterminological status of the units extracted sincethey can also select non terms (see Smadja 1993).For instance root nodulation is a term in the plantbiotechnology field whereas book review alsofound in the corpus is not.
Thus in the first stage,the terms extracted are only plausible candidateswhich need to be filtered in order to eliminate themost unlikely ones.
This filtering takes advantageof lexical information accessible at our level ofanalysis to fine-tune the statistical occurrencecriterion which used alone, inevitably leads to amassive limination.1.2 Splitt ing complex noun phrasesAn NP is deemed complex if its morpho-syntacticfeatures do not conform to that specified for terms,e.g.
oxygen control of nitrogen fixation geneexpression in bradyrhizobium japonicum a titlefound in our corpus.
Its corresponding syntacticcontext is : NP1_of_NP2_prepLNP3 where NP is arecognised noun phrase, prep~ refers to the class ofpreposition ot containing of and often found inthe morphological composition of terms (for, by,in, from, with).
Normally, exploiting syntacticinformation on the raising properties of the headnoun (control) and following the distributionalapproach, the above segment will be split thus :NPlNP2--4 NP3But this splitting is only performed if no sub-segment of the initial one occurred alone in thecorpu s. This search yielded nitrogen fixation geneexpression and bradyrhizobium japonicum whichboth occurred more than 6 times in the corpus.Their existence confirms the relevance of oursplitting rule which would have yielded the sameresult: oxygen control; nitrogen fixation geneexpression; bradyrhizobium japonicumAltogether, 4463 candidate terms were extractedfrom our corpus and subjected to a filteringprocess which combined lexical and statisticalcriteria.
The lexical criterion consisted ineliminating terms that contained a determinerother than the that remained after the splittingphase.
Only this determiner can occur in a term asit has the capacity, out of context, to refer to aconcept or object in a knowledge field, i.e.
the use565of the variant the low-line instead of the full termlow fertility droughtmaster line 2.
The statisticalcriterion consisted in eliminating terms startingwith the and appearing only once.
These twocriteria enabled us to eliminate 30% (1304)candidates and to retain 70% (3159) which weconsider to be likely terminological units.
We areaware that this filtering procedure remainsapproximate and cannot eliminate bad candidateslike book review whose morphological and lexicalmake-up correspond to those of terms.
But we alsoobserve that such bad candidates are naturallyfiltered out in later stages as they rarely possessvariants and thus will not appear as research topics(see ?4).2 Identifying syntactic variantsGiven the two syntactic structures under which aterm can appear - compound or syntagmatic - wefirst pre-processed the terms by transforming thosein a syntagmatic structure into their compoundversion.
This transformation is based on thefollowing noun phrase formation rule for English :DAM1 h p m Mz---~ D A m M2 Ml hwhere D, A and M are respectively strings ofdeterminer, adjective and words whose place canbe empty, h is a head noun, m is a word and p is apreposition.
Thus, the compound version of thespecific nodulation of alfalfa will give the specificalfalfa nodulation.
This transformation does notmodify the original structure under which a termoccurred in the corpus.
It only serves to furnishinput data to the syntactic variation identificationprograms.
This transformation which is equivalentto permutation (?2 .1) is  the linguistic relationwhich once accounted for, reveals the formalnature of the other types of syntactic variations.Also, it enables us to detect variants in the twosyntactic structures thus accounting for syntacticvariants such as defined in Tzoukermann et al(1997).
In what follows, t~ and t2 are terms.2.1 Permutation (Perm)It marks the transformation of a term, from asyntagmatic structure to a compound one :t I=ANMI  hpmM2t2=AmM2NMI  h2 It apparently refers to a breed (line) of cattle.where tl is really found in the corpus, N is a stringof words that is either empty or a noun.
37 termswere concerned by this relation.
Some examplesare given in Table 1.2.2 Subst i tut ion  (Sub)It marks the replacing of a component word in tlby another word in t2 in terms of equal length.Only one word can be replaced and at the sameposition to ensure the interpretability of therelation.
We distinguished between modifier andhead substitution.?
Modifier substitution (M-Sub) :t2 is a substitution of t~ if and only if :t~ = M 1 m M 2 h and t2 = M~ m' M 2 hwith m' ~ m?
Head substitution (H-Sub) :t2 is a substitution of tl if and only if :tz= Mmh andt2= Mmh'with h' ~ hTzoukermann et al (1997) considered chemicaltreatment against disease and disease treatment assubstitution variants whereas, in our study, aftertransformation, they would be a case of left-expansion (L-Exp).
Examples of head andmodifier substitutions are given in Table 2.
1543terms shared substitution relations : 1084 in themodifier substitution and 872 in the headsubstitution.
The same term can occur in bothcategories.2.3 Expans ion  (Exp)Expansion is the generic name designating threeelementary operations of word adjunction in anexisting term.
Word adjunction can occur in threepositions : left, right or within.
Thus we have leftexpansion, right expansion and insertionrespectively.?
Left expansion (L-Exp) :tz is a left-expansion of t~ if and only if :tl = Mh and t2 = M' m' M h?
Right expansion (R-Exp) :t2 is a right-expansion of t~ if and only if :tl =M h and t2 = M h M' h'?
Insertion (Ins) :t2 is an insertion of t~ if and only if :tl =Ml  mMzht2 =M1 mm'M'MEh566Examples of each sub-type of expansion are givenin Table 3.Some terms combine the two types of expansion -left and right expansions (noted LR-Exp), forexample root of  bragg ---> root exudate ofsoyabean cultivar bragg.
These complexexpansion variants were also identified.
A total of1014 terms were involved in the expansionvariation relations.
Altogether, 82% (2593 out of3159) terms were involved in the three types ofsyntactic variations studied showing theimportance of the phenomena amongst terms.Syntagmatic structureaccession of azolla-anabaenaavirulent strain of pseudomonas syringaecurling of root hairexcision of nodulethe specific nodulation of alfalfaCompound structureazolla-anabaena accessionavirulent pseudomonas syringae strainroot hair curling / root-hair curlingnodule excisionthe specific alfalfa nodulationTable 1.

Examples of expansions variants identified in the corpus.The programs identifying syntactic variants werewritten in the Awk language and implemented ona Sun Sparc workstation.Syntactic variations possess formal propertiessuch as symmetry and antisymmetry.
Permutationand substitution engender a symmetrical relationbetween terms, e.g.
genomic dna a template dna.3 This example is fictitious.567Expansion engenders an antisymmetrical or orderrelation between terms, for instance nitrogenfixation<nitrogen fxation gene<nitrogen fixationgene activation.
These two formal properties willform the second level for differentiating variationrelations during clustering (see ?4).3 Conceptual properties ofsyntactic variationsSyntactic variations yield conceptual relationswhich can reveal the association of conceptsrepresented by the terms.
We observed threeconceptual relations : class_of, equivalence,generic/specific.?
Class_ofSubstitution (Sub) engenders a relation betweenterm variants which can be qualified as "class_of".Modifier substitution groups properties around thesame concept class : template dna, genomic dna,target dna are properties associated to the class ofconcept named "dna".
Head substitution groupsconcepts or objects around a class of property:dna fragment, dna sequence, dna fingerprintingare concepts associated to the class of propertynamed dna.
This relation does not imply ahierarchy amongst terms thus somehow reflectingthe symmetrical relation engendered on the formallevel.?
EquivalencePermutation engenders a conceptual equivalencebetween two variants which partially echoes theformal symmetry, e.g.
dnafragment-fragment ofdna.?
Generic~specificExpansion, all sub-types considered, engenders ageneric/specific relation between terms whichechoes the antisymmetrical relation observed onthe formal level.
Expansion thus introduces ahierarchy amongst terms and allows us toconstruct paradigms that may correspond tofamilies of concepts or objects (R-Exp, LR-Exp)or families of properties (L-Exp, Ins).
Jacquemin(1995) reported similar conceptual relations forinsertion and coordination variants.4 Identifying topics organisationWe built a novel clustering method -Classification by Preferential Clustered Link(CPCL)  - to cluster terms into classes of researchtopics.
First we distinguished two categories ofvariation relations : those affecting modifier wordsnoted COMP (M-Sub, L-Exp, Ins) and thoseaffecting the head word noted CLAS (H-Sub, LR-Exp, R-Exp).The need to value the variation relations may ariseif a type (symmetrical orantisymmetrical) is in theminority.
To preserve the information it carries, adefault value is fixed for this minority type.
Thevalue of the majority type is then calculated as itsproportion with regard to the minority type.
In ourcorpus, Exp (antisymmetrical) relations were inminority compared to Sub (symmetrical relations).Their default value was set at 1.
The value of Subrelations was then given by the ratio Exp/Subwhere Exp (respectively Sub) is the total numberof expansions relations (respectively substitutions)between terms in the corpus.
This valuing ofvariation relations highlights a type of informationthat would otherwise be drowned but is not amandatory condition for the clustering algorithmto work.COMP relations tructure term variants around thesame head word thus forming componentsrepresenting the paradigms in the corpus.
Theseparadigms typically correspond to isolated topics(see Table 4 hereafter).
The strength of the linkbetween two components Pi and Pj is given by thesum of the value of variation relations betweenthem.
More formally, we define the COMPrelation between terms as : ti COMP tj iff ti and tjshare the same head word and if one is the variantof the other.
The transitive closure COMP* ofCOMP partitions the whole set of terms intocomponents.
These components are not isolatedand are linked by transversal CLAS relationsimplying a change of head word, thus bringing tolight the associations between research topics inthe corpus.CLAS relations cluster components basing on thefollowing principle : two components Pi and Pjare clustered if the link between them is strongerthan the link between either of them and any othercomponent Pk which has not been clusteredneither with Pi nor with Pj.
We call classification,a partition of terms in such classes.
An efficientalgorithm has been implemented in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1997) which seeks growing series of568such classifications.
These series represent moreor less fine-grained structurings of the corpus.
Amore formal description of the CPCL method canbe found in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1998).Table 4 shows a component and a class.The component formed around the head word hairreveals the properties (modifiers) associated withthis topic but does not tell us anything about itsassociation other topics.
The class on the otherhand reveals the association of hair with othertopics.A component II A class of termsalfalfa root haircurled root hairdeformed root hairlucerne root hairroot hairalfalfa root hairconcomitant root hair curlingcurled root hairdeformed root hairhair deformationlucerne root hairoccasional hair curlingroot deformationroot hairroot hair curlingroot hair deformationsome root hair curlingTable 4.
A component and a class.The graph in Figure 1 hereafter shows the globalorganisation of classes obtained from theclassification of the entire corpus (2593 syntacticterm variants).External links between classes are given by boldlines for R-Exp and LR-Exp, dotted lines portrayhead-substitution H-Sub.
Only one term from eachclass is shown for legibility reasons.
We observethat classes like 17, 19, 18 and 9 have a lot ofexternal links and seem to be at the core ofresearch topics in the corpus.
Classes like 12, 3and 13 share strong external inks with a singleclass which could indicate privileged thematicrelations.
The unique link between class 3 and 19is explained by the fact that 3 represented anemerging topic 4 at the time the corpus wasconstituted (1993) : the research done around anew gene type (the klebsiella pneumoniae nifbgene).
So it was relevant hat this class be stronglylinked to class 19 without being central.
Also,class 10 represented an emerging topic in 1993 :the research for retrotransposable elements whichenables the passing from one gene to another.Research topics evolution and transformation canbe traced through a chronological analysis ofclustered term variants (see Ibekwe-SanJuan1998).
The results obtained can support scientificand technological watch activities.Concluding remarksSyntactic variation relations are promisinglinguistic phenomena for tracking topic evolutionin texts.
However, being that clustering is basedon syntactic variation relations, the CPCL methodcannot detect topics related through semantic orpragmatic relations.
For instance, the topicdepicted by class 8 (glycine max) should havebeen related to topic 20 (lucerne plant) from asemantic viewpoint.
Their separation was causedby the absence of syntactic variations between theconstituent terms.
Such relations can be brought olight only if further knowledge (semantic) isincorporated into the relations used for clustering.In the future, we will test our clustering method onanother corpus of a larger size and extend ourstudy to other variation phenomena s possibletopic shifting devices.4 The interpretations given here are based on an oralcommunication with a domain information specialist.569AcknowledgementsThanks to the reviewers for their constructivecomments which I hope, helped improve thispaper.ReferencesBourigault D.
