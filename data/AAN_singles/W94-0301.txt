Discovery and Formatof Input Structures for Tactical GenerationMark SeligmanATR Interpreting Telecommunications Re .
Labs.2-2 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto 619-02 Japanemaih seligman@itl.atr.co.jpABSTRACTWe are concerned with the proper form for the structureswhich serve as the output of strategic generation and theinput to tactical generation.
How should the elements of thisstructure be discovered and how they should be arranged?
Inboth respects, our proposals will contrast with those ofRhetorical Structure Theory \[Mann and Thompson\].
Majorcomponents of the structure are discourse relations and"rhetorical types" (pragmatic objects similar to speech acts)to be discovered via paraphrase relations.
We describe adiscovery procedure and compare it with similar proposalsby Ivir et aland Knott and Dale.
We then argue that these andother components, once identified, should be arranged inlattices rather than strictly in hierarchies.
As illustration,we list the discourse relations and rhetorical types needed togenerate a paragraph-length discourse studied by Mann andThompson.
We present a lattice composed of these, and giveone example of an alternate version of the discourse whichcould be generated from it.INTRODUCTIONOur concern here is with the proper composition and form ofthe structures which serve as the output of strategicgeneration and the input to tactical generation -- that is, asthe interface between these processes.
We take discourserelations (essentially semantic recta-relations) and"rhetorical types" (pragmatic objects similar to speech acts)to be major elements of tactical input.
Our brief is that theseshould be discovered via judgments of synonymy, andshould be arranged in networks or lattices rather thanexclusively in hierarchies.Section 1 motivates and describes a paraphrase-orienteddiscovery method based on a suggestion by \[Ivir et al1973\]and compares it with a similar proposal \[Knott and Dale1992\].
Section 2 discusses rhetorical types and theirdiscovery.
Section 3 compares the paraphrase-based point ofview with that of theories in the style of RST whichconcentrate on elucidating the speaker's underlyingrhetorical goals.
A general theme will be that muchinformation concerning rhetorical goals and strategy shouldremain beyond the view of tactical generation programs.Section 4 defends the departure from strict hierarchy in ourdiscourse networks.
Finally, section 5 proposes a completelattice as tactical generation input for a paragraph-lengthdiscourse studied by \[Mann and Thompson 1983, 1984,1985\] and gives one example of an alternate version whichcould be generated.
The discourse relations and rhetoricaltypes we feel are needed to generate this discourse are listedin an Appendix I.
Each is accompanied by several possibleexpressive structures.We will be describing no particular programs or processes.We are concerned with strategic programs only inattempting to influence their final output.
Concerningtactical generation procedures uitable for expressing thelattice of Section 5, see \[Seligman 1991\] .1.
PARAPHRASE-BASED DISCOVERYOF DISCOURSE RELATIONSWe believe that "discourse relations" (essentially, semanticrecta-relations) and "'rhetorical types" (roughly, speech acts)1are major elements of an appropriate input structure fortactical generation, and that both sorts of elements can beidentified by analyzing their surface linguistic expressions.\[Seligman 91\] presented a discovery methodology based onsynonymy judgments, one intended to refine and make moreexplicit an earlier proposal appearing in \[Ivir et al1973\].Recently, an independent but quite similar suggestion by\[Knott and Dale 1992\] has introduced some furtherworthwhile refinements.Let us put forth the view of tactical generation whichmotivates this opinion.
We can then go on to compare thethree procedures.We take it as fairly uneontroversial that the role of a tacticalgeneration program is to express certain preselectedsemantic and pragmatic structures.
The strategic omponenthas decided that certain meanings and functions are to beexpressed; and the tactical component's assignment is toselect any combination of expressors which preserve thatmeaning and function.
Strategy has decided what to say;tactics must choose a way of saying it.But certain implications of this tactical assignment --"select expressors so as to preserve meaning and function" --need clarification.One implication, we think, is that a semantic or pragmaticsymbol at the tactical level should be considered by its verydefinition a shorthand for a semantic or pragmaticequivalence r lation: a way of capturing what semantic orpragmatic haracteristics ertain surface expressions have incommon.
And so a tactical generator's task with respect osuch a symbol, stated a bit more carefully, is to chooseamong expressions which have been previously judgedsemantically or pragmatically equivalent in context andgrouped under that symbol for just that reason.
(And, sincethere will be many symbols, each with several possiblestructures, it must also make sure that the respectiveexpressors are compatible.
)From this reconceptualization or redefinition of the tacticalrole, it follows directly that a procedure for discoveringsemantic or pragmatic symbols at the tactical evel shoulddepend on speakers' semantic and pragmatic equivalencejudgments.A commitment to restrict the tactical role to makingexpressive selections and checking expressorcompatabilities has a second implication: while there is agreat deal to be known about he connection between tacticalinput symbols and communicative goals or cognition, it isnot the tactical generator's job to know it.
Its input symbolsshould reflect utterance goals or the processes of decidingwhat to say only to the extent that these are slated forexplicit expression -- for instance, as the explicit markingsof this or that speech act.
A strategic program, whendelivering an input structure to the tactical generator, shouldsupply in its symbols and their interrelationships all theinformation necessary to make meaning-or-function-preserving expressor choices, but it need not supply a fulltrace of the strategic reasoning, and we should not expect o7th International Generation Workshop ?

June 21-24, 1994read the speaker's full motives, word selection process, andso on in the tactical input without reading between the lines.When the fox tells the crow his voice is beautiful, we willsee nothing of his ulterior motives in the tactical generationinput, though presumably they lurk in prior structuresleading to it.
At that level, we see only an assertion,indicating some speech goals to be sure, but only such as thefox decided would be politic.We are not, of course, suggesting that strategic problems beignored -- only that they can and should be cleanly separatedfrom tactical ones.
It is clear that true semantic andpragmatic studies -- studies howing how a given meaning orfunction (set of equivalent expressors) is selected in context-- must inform strategic programs.
(Beyond this, they aredesirable for tactical generation efforts as well, sincesemantic/pragmatic analysis can make more plausible a setof discourse relation symbols discovered via speakers'equivalence judgments.
For this purpose, we semanticallyanalyze several relations in \[Seligman 1991\] comparing ouranalysis with several competing ones.)
But whilesemantic/pragmatic study is indispensable, it ismethodologically valuable to separate it from synonym-based discovery of relations and to treat the discovery asprimary, as a first step.
One can first determine that nativespeakers judge several expressions to have the samemeaning or function in certain contexts, and then use thisinformation as a guide in investigating the nature of theequivalence -- the linkage to situations and goals.Assuming that the purpose of tactical semantic andpragmatic symbols is precisely to capture paraphrases -- tosymbolize what is semantically and pragmatically invariantin a range of surface xpressions -- it is natural that a symbolset is to be tested by generating purported paraphrases fromit.
Various versions of the output should indeed be judged topreserve meaning and pragmatic function.
If not, anothercycle of elieitation must tease apart distinctions orcommonalities missed the last time round.
Such iterativesemantic investigation is not new, of course: it has beentermed experimental semantics by \[Hutchins 1971, 1975,Leech 1970, 1974, Mel'chuk and Zholkovski 1970\] andothers.
The present modest proposal is to extend this sort ofinvestigation to discourse relations and rhetorical types aswell as to relations in general.
And in fact, we willcharacterize discourse relations as meta-relations, notdifferent in kind from tile lower-order elations theydominate.We now examine and compare three specific paraphrase-based discovery procedures for discourse relations.
We canroughly characterize these as semantic meta-relations --second-order relations, relations which relate relations --postponing further discussion until the discovery procedureshave been introduced.THE S-RELATORS OF IVIR EEl" ALIn a study unfortunately ittle known, \[Ivir et al1973\]categorize with uncommon completeness numerous "S-relators" -- syntactic structures associated with identifiablesemantic links among the meanings of sentences or clauses.Their catalog was compiled as part of a contrastive study ofEnglish and Serbo-Croatian, and thus strives for cross-linguistic universality.They began their study by compiling a list of surface clauserelators from the Brown corpus and standard grammaticalsources.
Their method for discovering discourse relations by2comparison of such surface expressions i described only asfollows:... we chose sets of two sentences \[in each language\]and applied the test of whether a particular item\[surface structure\] could link them withoutsubstantially altering the relationship indicated byother members of the same category.
What exactlyconstituted a "substantial" alternation, of course,presented a complex problem, which we dealt with byappealing to the intuition of native speakers \[Ivir et al1973:29\].The resulting S-relators, some 62 of them, are listed withtesting frames taken to be diagnostic and sample relatingstructures.
Here are two, omitting the equivalent Serbo-Croatian:Cont ras tRelator implies that $2 contrasts trongly with S1.That material is rather heavy.
This material is light.In~by (way oj9 contrastManner  of causationRelator implies that $2 is brought about by means of $1.He lost control of the car.
He knocked own the power line.thusand soin this way~mannertherebythat is how~the wayOther relators, intuitively grouped in the study according tosemantic field, include NON-REAL.CAUSE (as i f) ,COMPARATIVE.DEGREE ( so ... that, to such a degree),and fifty-odd others.
All these relations are listed along witha few typical expressors in an appendix to \[Seligman 91\].Later studies were planned to provide fuller expressorlistings, detailed syntactic analysis of the expressors, andstylistic comments concerning them, e.g.
"colloquial useonly".
However, it has not been possible to obtain them ordetermine if they were completed.\[Seligman 1991\], while accepting the basic premise of theprocedure just described, attempted to fill it out -- to make itmore explicit and complete.
In particular, Ivir et als briefmethodological description left unclear how expressivestructures can be discovered which are not simpleconjunctions.
Our procedure is designed to enable suchdiscovery by eliciting free paraphrase in addition to simplesyntax-preserving substitutions.The following methodology was suggested:?
Compile a list of surface clause relators.
Make it ascomplete as possible.From native speakers, elicit plausible examples foreach expressive structure.
For because, the exampleFred failed the test because he didn't study might beelicited.Elicit paraphrases of the examples, stipulating that themeaning should remain unchanged so far as possible.
(We take the position that, while true paraphrase may7th International Generation Workshop ?

June 21-24, 1994be rare owing to differences in emphasis, associations,register, etc., truth value can indeed remain invariantamong a series of alternate utterances.
There is someevidence \[Leech and Pepicello 1972\] that speakers canobserve such distietions.
See also \[Leech 1974\] and\[Seligman 1979\].)
For the present example, thefollowing paraphrases might be among those elicited:Because Fred didn't study, he failed the test.Fred failed the test because of not studying.Fred failed the test due to not studying.Fred did not study, so he \]'ailed the test.Fred did not study.
Consequently, he failed the test.Fred~ not studying caused his failure on the test.Fred's failure on the test was the result of his notstudying.The paraphrases may bring to light expressivestructures other than clause relators, e.g.
because of anddue to, which relate clauses to noun phrases.
Add theseto the master list, and repeat he above steps for them.Paraphrases based on a given structure (like because)may employ other structures in the master list (like so,consequent ly ,  etc.).
By crosszcorrelating thesepatterns, sort the expressive structures into proposedsynonymy groups.<CLAUSE> BECAUSE <CLAUSE><CLAUSE> BECAUSE OF <NP><CLAUSE> DUE TO <NP><CLAUSE> SO <CLAUSE><CLAUSE>CONSEQUENTLY <CLAUSE><NP> CAUSE <NP><NP> BE TIIE RESULT OF <NP>Assign a name to the relation assumed to underlie achsuch group -- in the present case, CAUSATION is a goodmnemonic andidate, though RELATION.1 would alsodo -- and the preliminary semantic analysis of discourserelations is complete.Notice that a given expressive structure can belong toseveral synonymy groups -- can be polysemous, in otherwords.
The expression so, for example, can express notonly CAUSATION (He lost too much blood so he died) butalso REASON (I'm studying so I won?flunk).KNOTT AND DALE'S PROCEDURE\[Knott and Dale 1992\] independently proposed a discoveryprocedure for discourse relations which is quite similar to the\[Seligman 1991\] proposal just discussed.... a classification of phrases according to theirfunction in discourse is our central objective .
.
.
.
Inkeeping with the data-driven methodology adoptedthus far, the classification will be made by means of asimple linguistic test, rather than by makingtheoretical claims about the semantics or pragmaticsof the phrases in the corpus.
The test is to do withsubstitutability.
Very broadly, if two phrases are inter-substitutable in a passage of discourse than theyshould be classified in the same category.
\[Knott andDale 1992:18\]The study also goes beyond the \[Seligman 1991\] proposal insome respects.
The most important refinement permits theprincipled iscovery of a hierarchical taxonomy of discourse 3relations, rather than the flat set of categories given by ourprocedure or the intuitively arranged taxonomy of Ivir et alThe key is to note relations of hyponymy as well asequivalence among the expressions studied.If one phrase can always be substituted for another, butnot vice versa, then the latter phrase should beclassified in a category subordinate to that of theformer phrase.
In this way a taxonomy of synonymsand hyponyms can be constructed.
\[Knott and Dale1992:18\]This addition is quite valuable.
First, it promises to displayrelationships among discourse relations more clearly andeconomically.
Representation f these relations in a frame-based inheritance hierarchy becomes increasingly attractive,for instance.
(The advantages of this representational formatfor linguistic objects in general are argued throughout\[Seligman 1991\].)
But it also points up once again anunderlying similarity between discourse relations andrelations in general: discourse relations are relations, andsubject to the same analytical techniques.
Hyponymyrelations, long noted among lexieal elements, can berecognized among discourse relators as well.Recognizing such hyponymy relations among discourserelators, we realize that one strategic task is to choose adegree of specificity for relations at the discourse level as forfirst order relations.
The choice between in short or themore specific in conclusion, then, is similar to that betweenbreak and the more specific shatter.
At the extreme, certainexpressors like full stop or semicolon would seem to be sogeneral as to express only that some unspecified relationobtains.On the other hand, another feature of the K&D procedure maydetract from its flexibility and generality.
Like the Ivir et alprocedure described above, the Knott and Dale substitutionspreserve syntactic structure.
While their procedure doespermit appropriate variation in the position of a substituteexpression, it does not accommodate (as our procedure does)very free paraphrases in which a relating expression is, forexample, sometimes a coordinator, sometimes a verb,sometimes a preposition, etc., with appropriate syntacticchanges in the related elements (John is fat because he eatstoo much.
John's overeating causes his obesity.
John is fatbecause of his overeating.)
Thus, whereas our procedurestarts with conjunctions and spreads toward meaning-relatedexpressions of any class, that of Knott and Dale purposelybegins with and keeps to coordinators, subordinators,conjunct adverbs, and certain phrases taking sententialcomplements.
(A clear procedure is described for selectingthese relators at the outset \[Knott and Dale 1992:14-15\].)
Acompromise procedure which allows free paraphrases whilerecognizing hyponyms might provide the best of bothworlds.Based upon this methodology for discovery, we believe withIvir et aland with Knott and Dale that many discourserelations can be recognized.
(Ivir et allist more than 60;K&D group relators into about 45 categories.)
Recall that wecharacterized discourse relations as meta-relations.
Speakersof a language recognize and conventionalize thousands offirst-order elations; why should they not also recognizemany relations among relations?
Accordingly, in the termsof \[Hovy 1990\], we are.
"profligate" seekers of discourserelations.
(By contrast, the relatively "parsimonious" Mannand Thompson posit some 25-30, while Hobbs employsonly eight.)
We would not be surprised if there were ahundred or more, considering that we recognize additional7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine ?

which Ivir et aldo not observe.
Theylist seven relations where we see 15-20 \[Seligman 1986\].
)We now turn from discourse relations toward a different classof linguistic objects, roughly that of speech acts.2.
RHETORICAL TYPESTo realistically generate paraphrases of a sample discoursebelow, we will need to recognize semantic/pragmatic objectswe term rhetorical types.
Following are the textual segmentsin question, each accompanied by paraphrases.?
Tempting as it may be, we shouldn't embrace everypopular issue that comes along..Although, granted, it is tempting, we shouldn'tembrace very popular issue that comes along.I grant you that it is tempting, but we shouldn'tembrace very popular issue that comes along.True, it is tempting, but we shouldn't embrace verypopular issue that comes along.?
Let's be clear: I personally favor the initiative andardently support disarmament egotiations to reduce therisk of war.Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I personallyfavor the initiative and ardently support disarmamentnegotiations to reduce the risk of war.are sometimes called "semantic" in current discussion.
Weavoid this term here as overburdened.
)Specification of non-rhetorical circumstances alone will notsuffice to predict the felicity of any utterance.
Havingdetermined that the speaker's aunt's pen is on the table, wecannot predict the appropriateness of her utterance Myaunt's pen is on the table.
Rather, the utterance will beappropriate if these non-rhetorical circumstances obtain andthe speaker believes the audience does not know about hem,ought to know about them, etc.
-- in other words, when allthe rhetorical circumstances (felicity conditions) for anassertion also obtain \[Searle 1969\].
In fact, it is justbecause a great many utterances share these same rhetoricalcircumstances that we find it worthwhile to distinguish asubclass of utterances called ASSERTIONS.
Other utterancesubclasses specified in terms of the rhetorical circumstancesthey share are recognizable as speech acts in the tradition of\[Austin 1962\] and \[Searle 1969\] -- assertions, questions,commands, requests, etc.
We will instead speak of"rhetorical types", however, because we want to includeutterance classes not universally considered in the speech actliterature.
In the cases at hand, these are subclasses of"classical" speech acts.
For example, FORMAL.REQUESTScan (obviously enough) be seen as a subclass of REQUESTS.Similarly, we view CONCESSIONS as a subclass ofASSERTIONS in which the specification is added that thespeaker grudgingly recognizes the truth of the concededassertion.
And we view CLARIFICATIONS as a subclass ofASSERTIONS in which the speaker explicitly signalsapprehension that the assertion is needed to clear upmisunderstandings which may have been engendered by theforegoing.1 personally favor the initiative and ardently supportdisarmament egotiations to reduce the risk of war, Iwant that to be quite clear.?
I urge you to vote against a CCC endorsement of theNuclear Freeze Initiative.1 request hat you vote against a CCC endorsement ofthe Nuclear Freeze Initiative.I ask you to vote against a CCC endorsement of theNuclear Freeze Initiative.We establish paraphrase groupings here in order todistinguish rhetorical types, just as we did for discourserelations -- and just as we might do for semantic objects ingeneral.
The more reliably we can predict a paraphrase set(e.g.
true, <clause> or granted,  <clause>, etc.
), themore certain we can be that a distinct underlying pragmaticobject has been identified.
We will refer to the symbolyielding the first grouping as CONCESSION.
The second andthird groupings will respectively be generated via thesymbols CLARIFICATION and FORMAL.
REQUEST.But just what are rhetorical types?
And how are they differentfrom standard relations like BELIEVE or discourse relationslike NON.PREVENTIONS?
We now sketch our point of view.For any utterance, we can attempt to specify thecircumstances that make it appropriate.
The circumstances,however, divide themselves into two important types: thoserelating to the communicative goals of the speechparticipants, which we can term rhetorical circumstances;and those relating to everything else, which we can termnon-rhetorical circumstances.
(Non-rhetorical circumstances4Do discourse relations represent groupings of rhetorical ornon-rhetorical circumstances?
One is apt to opt forRhetorical at first blush: they do help to hold a discoursetogether by relating relations -- hence the name discourserelations -- and thus acquire an association with pragmatics.But clearly, no communicative goals need be considered torecognize a CAUSATION or a SEQUENCE.
In ourconception, then, discourse relations categorize non-rhetorical utterance circumstances just as garden-varietyrelations do, and are not to be confused with rhetoricaltypes.Below, we symbolize the relationship between a rhetoricaltype and an associated relation (of any order) as one ofdominance.
ASSERTION.l, for instance, might dominateHITTING.1.
Other possible representations are considered in\[Seligman 1991\].3.
PARAPHRASE-BASED DESCRIPTIONS VS. RSTHaving described an approach to discourse relations andrhetorical types (finely subcategorized speech acts), we arenow in a position to very briefly discuss the relationshipbetween these objects and those of certain current discoursetheories.
We concentrate on the Rhetorical Structure Theoryof \[Mann and Thompson 1983, 1984, 1985\] as especiallyinfluential, but our comments will apply equally to relatedtheories in which the central concern is an account of thespeaker's goals.
Knott and Dale provide a good startingpoint: although they describe their own substitution-baseddiscourse relator categories as "pre-theoretical", they havenoted some discrepancies between these categories and therelations of RST.It should be noted that the categories of cue phrasescan often be mapped roughly back onto relations inRST's original set.
Relations like sequence, contrast,7th International Generation Workshopcircumstance, cause, and result all find naturalcorrelates in the taxonomy .... At the same time, thereare significant differences.
These are sometimes to dowith granularity: for instance, cue phrases marking asequence relation do not form a single group, but arethemselves taxonomized.
Again, the distinctionbetween volitional-result and non-volitional-resultfinds no correlate in the taxonomy.
On the other hand,some RST relations do not appear to have anyrelational phrases associated with them.
Evaluation,for instance, seems to fall into this class.
Andelaboration, while a prominent relation in many RSTanalyses, seems to have no single phrase to mark it --a particularly surprising finding.
\[Knott and Dale1992:21\]These mismatches come about naturally.
RST is primarilyconcerned with the speaker's goals.
When an analysis iscomplete, one hopes to have inferred an indication of theunderlying oals which gave rise to the discourse.
Surfaceexpressions are viewed primarily as clues to these, albeitvery imperfect clues in that they are often ambiguous ormissing.
One views speaker goals through surfaceexpressions as through a glass darkly.
So an RST analysisgets what help it can from the surface expressions, butdepends mainly upon plan inference.
Now, given the aim offinding deeper hetorical goals and given the indirectness ofthe link between goals and cue phrases, it should not besurprising that when an RST structure is used for generation,it is very likely to underspecify or not specify the particularlanguage to be used.
To the extent that RST-styledescriptions concentrate on rhetorical goals like evaluationor elaboration which may never be explicitly expressed,they are more appropriate for strategic than for tacticaldescription.By contrast, aparaphrase-based tructure, when it is used forgeneration, should indeed give a full specification of theavailable linguistic choices.
But in compensation, asalready dramatized with fox and crow, it will not display allthe planning that went into the decisions about what toexpress.A different metaphor may be helpful in conceptualizing thedifference between a goal-oriented escription of anutterance and one which is oriented toward explicit linguisticexpression.
When building a house, the contractor expects ablueprint specifying its structure in sufficient detail foractual construction, though some degrees of freedom usuallyremain.
One certainly has many goals in building the house,including the meeting of many constraints -- financial ones,those of site geography, and so on.
But these do not appearin the blueprint.
The blueprint, rather, is the detailed workspecification resulting from -- the output of, the trace of --the planning to meet those goals.
Of course, one can infermuch about he goals by examining this work specification,but does not expect hem to be included within it.
One canguess a lot about a homeowner's financial constraints bylooking at ablueprint; but one does not expect o see therethe notation, "Build this house for under X dollars", or theowner's bank balance.
Conversely, the builder would not getsufficient guidance for actual construction by looking at ahigh-level description of the owner's housing goals.It was said that some degrees of freedom usually remain.Blueprints can vary in the degrees of specification theyprovide and the degrees of freedom they leave.
We can forinstance imagine a blueprint as made up of several overlays.There is the electrical wiring diagram, the piping, etc., inaddition to the framework.
If one overlay were missing, the5?

June 21-24, 199,4builder would be underguided or underconstrained.
Likewise,an input structure for tactical generation may ideally containseveral overlays, and be underconstrained for the lack of oneor more.
The network of Figure 4, in particular, does notindicate thematic information or salience.
Consequently, itunderconstrains the ordering and thematic structures of theoutput, giving rise to paraphrases which vary freely in theserespects.
(\[Hovy 1993\] urges a many-factored view ofgeneration i put.
)Notice finally that the choices of surface expression fordiscourse relations and rhetorical types available to atactical program will often include ambiguous expressors.So,  as we saw, can express CAUSE, PURPOSE, and otherrelations.
So even a relatively full specification from thegeneration viewpoint can lead to language which would beambiguous for an analysis program.
Expressors can also beunhelpfully general in meaning from an understander'sviewpoint, with full stop as an extreme example.
Ananalysis routine may in such eases need a wide range ofknowledge to determine which tactical symbol gives a betterinterpretation, or what more specific symbol could havebeen used instead.
However, knowledge of possiblemappings between expressors and semantic/pragmaticsymbols, and of the full range of conventional discourserelations and rhetorical types, should provide someconstraint.
To this extent, knowledge about symbols at thetactical evel should give at least some help in ultimatelyworking back toward the rhetorical goals that gave rise tothe discourse.4.
HIERARCHIES OR NETWORKS?We have discussed symbols for discourse relations andrhetorical types in tactical input structures.
We turn now tothe arrangement of these dements.
To give a preliminaryidea of our motivations for employing raphs rather thanhierarchies, consider the story of Ted, who drank too muchand got sick, but gamely went to work anyway.
Figure 1(top) shows our preferred representation for the underlyingset of relations.
A fuller account of the relationsCAUSATION and NON.PREVENTIONS appears in \[Seligman1991\].
We assume they are sufficiently self-explanatory forthe present.
For comparison, Figure 1 (bottom) displays ahierarchical version of the same set of relations.We would argue that the hierarchical version distorts therelationships in question.
It was not the causal relationbetween Ted's drinking and becoming sick that failed to stophim from heroically going to work.
It was his becomingsick which failed to prevent his going ahead.
However, if weare bound by convention to offer only hierarchicalrepresentations for this complex of relations, there will beno way of avoiding such distortion.
It is this convention weare arguing against.We do not argue that discourse segments can never take on ahierarchical form.
The point is rather that hierarchies appearas special cases in relation networks, and that non-hierarchical connections can be formed as well.Let us reconsider the same points in the context of asomewhat larger and less artificial network.
We will considera fragment from a text studied by Mann and Thompson,given in full in Section 5.Tempting as it may be; we shouldn't embrace verypopular issue that comes along.
When we do so, we useprecious limited resources where other players withsuperior esources are already doing an adequate job.Rather, I think we will be stronger and more effective7th International Generation Workshop ?
Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994if we stick to those issues of governmental structureand process, broadly defined, that have formed the coreof our agenda for years.
Open government, campaignfinance reform, and fighting the influence of specialinterests and big money -- these are our kinds ofissues.M&T's analysis of the fragment appears in Figure 2.
Forcomparison, our own analysis appears in Figure 3.M&T see this entire fragment as instantiating a singlediscourse schema, THESIS/ANTITHESIS.
Thus the fragmentdivides itself into something the writer identifies with andsomething he does not identify with.In our analysis, by contrast, there is no overarchingTHESIS/ANTITHESIS relation.
The various relations in thefragment are linked together, to be sure; but it is not becausethey are all under a single roof.
Rather, they are linked astowns are linked in a road system: any destination can bereached from any other, sometimes in more than one way.Compare also the EVIDENCE relation of M&T to theREASON.FOR.BELIEF relation of our analysis.
In bothanalyses, there is a claim to be supported, namely theproposition we shouldn't embrace every popular issue thatcomes along.
We see only the SHOULDN'T proposition asthe claim.
But M&T treat this proposition as embeddedwithin another elation, so that the latter is represented asthe thing to be proved.
We find this indirectness unintuifive,an artifact of the dictum that only hierarchical arrangementsare allowed.
(Similarly, we earlier rejected a straw-mananalysis of the Ted discourse in which the relationshipbetween NON.PREVENTION.1 and BECOMING.1 wasobscured by an intervening layer of structure.
)With this orientation, we are now prepared to present severalarguments against a pure ly  hierarchical discourserepresentation.The existence proof.
Some discourses seemcoherent because there are interconnections amongtheir major parts, even though there would seem to beno identifiable overarching schema in which they allparticipate.
We offer the Ted mini-discourse, Ted dranktoo much, so he got sick, but he went to work, as anexample.
It seems to be organized more like a three-linkchain than a tree.
If this is granted, we will have foundat least one example of a coherent but non-hierarchicaldiscourse.The reductio ad absurdum.
We doubt that a singleoverarching schema can be discovered for a very longdiscourse like a novel.
If one can be found, we are afraidit will be too general to be useful.
In particular, it is notlikely to have expressions predictably associated withit, once upon a time notwithstanding.
It might becountered that discourses are hierarchical only up to acertain size.
But as soon as one grants the need for somenon-hierarchical mechanism to relate the largesthierarchies, our case is made.The handl ing of reference.
Graphs are oftenpreferred over trees to represent situations in which asingle entity performs multiple roles.
In the CCC Text,for example, the proposition/relation u derlying (we)embrace every popular issue that comes along plays apart in three higher-level relations: it is tempting to ....we shouldn't .... and i f  ... then we will use limitedresources .
Our representation handles this multi- 6reference quite naturally, by having three different linksconverging on the same relation.
There can be noconverging in the hierarchical representation.
Indecescould be used to show the convergence; but this is extramachinery we would rather do without.Di rectness of  connect ions  as an aid torecord -keep ing .
M&T recognize that within anyspan there is a proposition that epitomizes its function\[Mann and Thompson 1984:6\].
We think that such amost-functional proposition should itself be recognizedas the direct argument, or terminal, of t_he relation inquestion.
The relationships of span-mates to the objecton the business end of a relation should be representeddirectly, via other specific relations.
Such a network ofdirect and specific connections w~ll facilitate record-keeping when discourse segments are scrambled uringrealization, especially when elements belonging toseparate M&T spans intermix.Can there be degrees of coherence?
Arguing foran exclusively hierarchical treatment, M&T argue that,if any single relation is removed, the network as awhole is split into pieces: it is no longer coherent\[Mann and Thompson 1985:12\].
In our treatment, anetwork may or may not be sundered when a single linkis cut, since there may be alternative routes availablebetween subnets.
Its coherence will indeed be reduced,since one less relation is made explicit, but this is amatter of degree.
And it should be.
A discourse, it seemsto us, is not usually judged either totally coherent ortotally incoherent.
Rather, it may be more or lesscoherent.A network analysis does not preclude the recognition ofhierarchical part-to-whole relationships within a discourse.On the contrary, the structure appears in the net's topology.Consider a transportation network, in which roads clusterand converge to form obvious hubs, linked by sparse trunklines.
In a discourse network, relations likewise definebustling hubs and lonely highways.
The hubs, or sets ofnodes linked by many connections, are major parts ordivisions within the net.
Relatively few connections runbetween them.
Further, just as there may be sub-hubs withina large city -- the Port Authority terminal in New York City,for example -- discourse network topology can define partswithin discourse sections, so that the familiar sort of part-within-part hierarchy can be recovered.
Further, discourseparts or segments, once identified in this way, mightcertainly be associated on a strategic level with rhetoricalpurposes in the manner of \[Grosz and Sidner 1986\].5.
EXAMPLESFor illustration, we now turn to a short attested iscoursestudied by \[Mann and Thompson 1983, 1984, 1985\] and todescription of the discourse relations and rhetorical types wefind necessary for tactical generation of it.
A sample latticecomposed of these will be shown, and one alternate versionof the discourse which could be generated, assuming asuitable grammar and procedure, e.g.
that of \[Seligman1991\].THE CCC TEXTWe have already seen part of the "CCC Text".
A letter-writerattempts to convince fellow members of California CommonCause to vote down a proposal to support a Nuclear Freeze.I don't believe that endorsing the Nuclear FreezeInitiative is the right step for California CC.7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine ?
June 21-24, 1994Tempting as it may be, we shouldn't embrace verypopular issue that comes along.
When we do so, we useprecious limited resources where other players withsuperior esources are already doing an adequate job.Rather, I think we will be stronger and more effectiveif we stick to those issues of governmentai structureand process, broadly defined, that have formed the coreof our agenda for years.
Open government, campaignfinance reform, and fighting the influence of specialinterests and big money -- these are our kinds ofissues.Let's be clear: I personally favor the initiative andardently support disarmament egotiations to reducethe risk of war.
But I don't think endorsing a specificnuclear freeze proposal is appropriate for CCC.
Weshould limit our involvement in defense and weaponryto matters of process, such as exposing the weaponsindustry's influence of the political process.Therefore, I urge you to vote against a CCCendorsement of the nuclear freeze initiative.DISCOURSE RELATIONS AND RHETORICALTYPESThe discourse relations and rhetorical types we will use torepresent this text at the tactical evel are listed in AppendixI along with very brief characterizations, relevant passagesin the CCC Text, and representative (but incomplete) list ofexpressive patterns, some of which will appear in samplegeneration output below.
(\[Seligman 1991\] provides muchfuller discussion of these and other relations, commentingon the differences between our analysis and that of severalother esearchers.
Space precludes such treatment here.
)The relations are grouped for convenience, .g.
as relationsof the but type, the and type.
the/f type, etc.
We make noclaims for the present grouping scheme, but do believe withKnott and Dale that relations can be classified according tomeaning overlaps and differences.
(Ivir et alprovide anintuitive taxonomy close to our present one.
It appears as anappendix in \[Seligman 1991\].
)LATTICE FOR TACTICAL GENERATION INPUT ANDSAMPLE OUTPUTThe discourse relations and rhetorical types in Appendix Ican be interconnected to compose the lattice shown inFigure 4.\[Seligman 1991\] describes a small set of network traversalstrategies which permits repeated application of a sentencegrammar to generate paragraphs expressing the whole net.An important part of this procedure is the capacity togenerate bottom-up -- to find well-formed continuations forpartial structures which are already complete.
Certain simplefacilities for handling anaphora re also specified.
Spacelimitations will not permit description of these expressionprocedures here.
For concreteness and illustration, however,we provide one possible output version, Appendix II.Numbers in the network show the ordering in which latticenodes would be visited to produce the discourse variant ofAppendix II.
Numerous other variants (some shown in\[Seligman 1991\]) could be produced by varying the traversalordering and selection of expressors.
Next to each discourserelation (underlined once) or rhetorical type (underlinedtwice) is a parenthesized indication of the pattern used in oursample variant.
For instance, example (a) indicates thechoice of the pattern labeled (a) to express the EXAMPLE7relation.
Just below the relation is the chosen expressoritself, e.g.
"For example".Two types of abbreviation i the sample network should bepointed out.First, in order to concentrate on discourse relations andrhetorical types, we use ad hoc semantic tokens asterminals.
These can in turn receive ad hoc mappings tosyntactic structures below the clause level.
For instance, thead hoe semantic relation IT.IS.TEMPTING might be realizedonly as elause: it is tempting <verb phrase, toinf in i t ives.
In the sample output text, such fixed text isshown in plain typeface.
However, discourse-level structuresgenerated analytically -- our focus here -- are italicized.Secondly, every relation in our network ought to beassociated with a rhetorical type, since purely non-rhetoricalcircumstances cannot alone justify any utterance.
So, just asCONCESSION, CLARIFICATION, and FORMAL.REQUESTpoint to their respective relations, all other relations houldbe covered by rhetorical types, here probably ASSERTIONin each case.
For simplicity and readability, however, wetreat assertions as implied, or unmarked, rhetorical types.CONCLUSIONSWe have argued that a high-level specification of a speaker'sgoals in producing a discourse is not an appropriate input fora tactical generator.
The latter must assume that someprocess has already decided what to say for whatever reasons,and requires a specification of what to say in symbolsclosely tied to potentially usable Surface linguisticexpressions.
These symbols should represent pragmatic orsemantic ("rhetorical or non-rhetorical") equivalence classesof expressions, and should thus be discovered by using asprimary data speakers' equivalence judgments.
We offered adiscovery procedure based on paraphrase, intended to bemore explicit and flexible than a procedure suggested by Iviret al We then compared our proposal with a later,independent suggestion due to Knott and Dale, finding thatthe K&D procedure's ability to induce hyponymy as well asequivalence relationships was advantageous, but that itsconsideration of only certain syntactic lasses as discourserelation expressors might be overly restrictive.We presented a number of arguments for tactical inputspecifications arranged as lattices rather than strictly ashierarchies.For illustration, we listed the discourse relations andrhetorical types needed to generate an attested paragraph-length discourse.
We proposed a lattice composed of these astactical generation i put, and gave one example of the sortof discourse version which could be generated, assuming asuitable grammar and set of procedures.REFERENCESAustin, J.
