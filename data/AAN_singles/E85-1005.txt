THE SPECIFICATION OF TIME MEANING FOR MACHINE TRANSLATIONFrank van Eynde - Catholic University LeuvenBlijde Inkomststraat, 21, 3000 Leuven, BelgiumLouis des Tombe - Utrecht State UniversityTrans I 14~ 3512 3K Utrecht, HollandFons Maes - Catholic University of TilburgPostbus g0153, 5000 LE Tilburg~ HollandIn this paper, we put Torward some ideas onthe reoresentation of time in a machinetranslat ion system.
In such a system, weusually have the following four representations:- source text- source representation- target representation- target textIn an inter l ingual  system, there is nodifference between source and targetrepresentation; in a transfer-based system,the step between the two is usually calledtransfer, and this step is meant to be assimple as possible.The research described was or ig ina l ly  done inthe framework of the EUROTRA MT project,which is transfer-based.
However, i t  canbe used in other MT systems as well; inTact, i t  is very well suited for inter l ingualsystems.The problem with time meaning is that i t  isexpressed in natural languages in a way thatis non-universal and, moreover, not veryperspicuous prima facie.
As a consequence, i tis d i f f i cu l t  to find rules for thetranslation of the tense form of the verb.In this paper, we propose a conceptualcalculus in which the meanings oflanguage specific temporal expressionscan be represented in an inter l ingual  way,so that the translation of the la t ter  canbe achieved via the corresponding conceptualrepresentations.The exposition wi l l  consist of three parts.F i rst ,  we define a time axis model, i .e .
amodel in which temporal concepts can beunderstood.Second, we establish two types of generalconstraints:~i) Constraints on possible time meaningrepresentations, result ing in a restr ictedclass of meanings for time anO relatedphenomena in terms of this model.
( i i )  Constraints on the relat ions betweensyntactic/morphological forms and timemeanings, result ing in a non-arbitraryre lat ion between form and meaning.Third, we show how the calculus can beused for the inter l ingual  analysis ofthe tense forms of verbs.I.
The time axis model.The model is a temporal structure<time,< >, wheretime is a set of elements called time-points;( i i )< is a binary re lat ion that l inear ly  orderstime (and can be interpreted as 'precedes');An interval (1) is a subset of time that doesnot contain 'gaps', i .

:  ~ t l , t2  E It3 G time (t1<t3<t2 -> t3 E I ).We now turn to the time meanings anq theirrepresentations.F i rst ,  we want to separate the expressionthat represents time meaning from the rest ofthe sentence.
The instruments we use arebased on Dowty (1979):(i)A tNo-place operator AT that takes aninterval  and a formula to yield anotherformula, with the following interpretat ion:W(AT(I~O)=I at whatever time t if?
W(O)=I atthe interval I.

is t / t ;  i t  cant ion in aThe in terpreta t ion  of (I) is the set ofproposit ions that are true at some givenin terva l  I , .

Analogously, a time in terva lcan be ident i f ied  with the co l lec t ion  ofproposit ions that are true at i t .2.
A theory  of time meanings.In many discussions of time meaning, aOist inct ion is made between an internal  andan external temporal system.
The externalsystem represents the tempora l  re la t ionbetween the state of affairs as described bythe basic proposit ion and the time at whichthe utterance takes place.
This system alwaysrefers to the speaker or wr i te r ,  andconsequently i t  is a de ic t i c  system.
Theinternal  system is about such things aswhether the state of a f fa i r s  expressed in thebasic proposit ion is described as going on,having lus t  s ta r ted ,  having been completed,etc.
This type of information is often cal ledaspectual.In th is  paper, we adopt the fo l lowing threebasic pr inc ip les  for the representation oftime meanings:(I)Each time meaning representation containsexact ly three time in terva ls :- the time of speech or narrat ion (S)- the time of event (E), i .
e .
the in terva lat which the basic proposit ion is saidto be true- one time of re ference  (R)The S- interval  consists of one point only:i t  is a s ingleton.
The R- and E- in terva ls  arenon-empty subsets of time.
( I I )The de ic t i c  part of time meaning is representedby a binary re la t ion  between S and R andopt iona l ly  by one pred icate  over  R,( I l l )Aspect is represented by a binary re la t ionbetween R and E, and opt iona l ly  by onepredicate over E.Pr inciples (1), ( I I ) ,  and ( I l l )  togetherimply that the general form of a time meaningrepresentation can be somewhat s imp l i f ied .
I tw i l l  now be:(2)k p 3 S,R,E ~ t ime (Re l t (R ,S )  & Pred.
(R)  &Rel=(E,R) & Pred=(E) & AT(E,p))Apart from the constraints on possibletime meaning representations there are someconstraints on the re la t ion  between thetime meanings and the language speci f icmorphosyntactic forms for expressing thosemeanings:(IV)The pred icates  over R are those t imeadverbials that can be used as answers towhen-questions, such as(3) yesterday, now, next week, on Tuesday(V)The pred icates  over E are (a .o . )
theduration time adverbials,  such as(4) for an hour, f i ve  weeks, sinceChristmas, unt i l  ~une(vI)The re la t ions  between R and S and betweenE and R are  determined by the in teract ionof the verbal tense forms and the timeadverbials in ways to be specif ied andexemplif ied in section three.We w i l l  now present the de ic t i c  and theaspectual components of the temporal systemin some deta i l .2.1.
The de ic t ic  system.As possible re la t ions  between S and R wew i l l  take( i)  before (R,S), defined as in I.
( i i )  a f ter  (R,S), defined analogously( i i i )  contain (R,S), defined as fol lows :t s time (t ~ S - - -> t ~ R)36The speci f iers  of the reference time are thewhen-adverbials.
A c lass i f i ca t ion  of thela t te r  that appears to be relevant for theassignment of de ic t i c  values in par t i cu larcases is the fo l lowing one :in fac t ,  an i te ra t ive  in terpreta t ion ,  and fo rsuch in terpreta t ions  we need a more complexrepresentat ion  format .
This wi l l  not bedeveloped in th i s  paper,  but see Van Eynde(forthcoming).de ic t ic  abso lu tebefore a f te r  conta in  on Tuesdayyesterday n xt nowweekThe de ic t i c  when-adverb ia l s  de f ine  the pos i t ionof the re fe rence  t ime with respect  to the t imeof speech, and cannot be combined with a l lpossible tenses.
An af ter -adverb ia l  is ,  forinstance, not compatible with the simple past:(5) * he came next weekThe absolute when-adverbials determine theposit ion of the reference time independentlyfrom the speech time.
Depending an which tensethey are combined with they can e i ther  specifya re ference  t ime that  precedes the speech t ime,as in(b) she came on Tuesdayor a re fe rence  t ime that  fo l lows  the speecht ime,  as in(7) she comes/ is coming/w i l l  co le  on TuesdaySince there is only one reference time in therepresentation (= pr inc ip le  ( I ) )  and sincethe when-adverbials always specify the referencetime (= pr inc ip le  ( IV)) ,  i t  is predicted that aproposit ion can contain at most one when-adverbial.At f i r s t  sight th is  predict ion seems to hold:of.
the ungrammaticality of(8) a.
* He le f t  yesterday one week agob.
* In 1990 he w i l l  have arr ived in 1998c.
* In 1955 he had died in 1944There are,  however, some problem cases, such as(9) He le f t  on Tuesday at 9 o 'c lock(10) Last year he used to a r r ive  at 9 o 'c lock(9) contains two when-adverbials, but noticethat they can be used together as an answer toone when-question, and th is  indicates thaton Tuesday at 9 o 'c lock '  is just a complexspeci f icat ion of one and the same in terva l .
(10) is a more serious case.
Here the twoadverbials cannot be considered to specify thesame in terva l :  ' l as t  year' denotes the timeof his habit to arr ive  at 9 o'clock and"at 9 o 'c lock '  denotes the time of each of hisa r r iva l s  of last year.
What we have in (10) is ,2.2.
The aspectual part.There is much discussion in the l i te ra tureabout what aspect is.
A descript ion that isnat very precise, but has the merit of beingindependent of l ingu is t i c  form, is the onegiven by Coerie (1976, p. 3):'As the general de f in i t ion  of aspect, we maytake the formulation that "aspects ared i f fe rent  ways of viewing the internaltemporal constituency of a s i tuat ion" .In an ar t i c le  on the general theory ofaspect Friedrich distinguishes threepossible aspects :( i )  punctual, completive, per fect ive,  etc;( i i )  durat ive,  cont inuat ive,  etc;( i i i )  s ta t ive ,  perfect,  etc.
(o f .
F r iedr i ch  1974, p. 36)The same th ree  aspects  turn  up in the workof Coer ie ,  3ohnsan, Hopper, and o thers .We wi l l  ca l l  them respect ive ly  perfect ive,imperfect ive, and retrospect ive.The in tu i t ions  about the three are bas ica l lythe fo l lowing:( i )  perfect iveThis aspect presents a s i tuat ion  'as asingle unanalyzable whole' (Camrie, o .c .
,p.
3).
( i i )  imperfective:This aspect ' looks at the s i tuat ion  from theins ide'  (Comrie, op.
t i t ,  p.4),  and focusseson beginning, cont inuat ion,  or ending of i t .
( i i i )  retrospect ive:This aspect 'expresses a re la t ion  between twot ime-points,  on the one hand the time of thestate resul t ing from a pr ior  s i tuat ion ,  andon the other the time of that pr iors i tuat ion . '
( ib id .
,  p. 52).In order to make these nations more precise,and -at the same time- to integrate them intoour representation format, we w i l l  adopt thefol lowing proposal by Johnson:'What I am proposing concerning the semanticsof the aspect forms is that they specify there la t ion  between reference time and event timein an utterance. '

I tseems to  be less  common than the other  ones,and there  i s  some disagreement on the issueof what i t s  language spec i f i c  counterpar tsare ( ' to  be going to '  ? )
,  but conceptua l lyi t  can be defined fa i r l y  eas i ly ,  namely asthe complement of the retrospect ive aspect:( i v )  p rospect ive :  a f te r  (E,R)The in terva l  E can be specif ied byadverbials.
One class of E-specif iers is theclass of duration adverbials.
The reasonsfor t reat ing these adverbials asE-specif iers are the fol lowing ones :I. they always denote the in terva l  at whichthe basic proposit ion is said to take place;in that  respect  they are d i f fe rent  from thewhen-adverbials, since the la t te r  can alsodenote a time that does not coincide with theevent time (of.
the non-perfect(re aspects).2. they cannot be combined with a l l  possibleproposit ions; they are, for instance, notcompatible with momentaneous events:(11) they reached the summit for  a wh i leThe ungrammat ica l i ty  of 411) can be exp la inedi f  we take the durat ion  adverb ia l s  to  spec i fythe event time, since the la t te r  cannot beboth a moment (as requ i red  by the propos i t ion)and an in terva l  of some durat ion  las requ i redby the adverb ia l ) .3. they never have a de(eric function: theyare not used for specifying the re la t ionbetween some in terva l  and the.moment of speech.As in the case of the when-adverb ia l s  i t  i sposs ib le  to have two durat ion  adverb ia l s  in thesame c lause:(12) he has been s tudy ing  two hours a days ince h is  ch i ldhood  nowNot ice ,  however, that  i12) has an i te ra t ivein terpreta t ion ,  and s ince the t reatment  ofsuch in terpreta t ions  requ i res  a moreelaborated representation scheme anyway,we can st ick to the pr inc ip le  that a clausecontains at most one E-speci f ier .
In th is  casethe E-specif ier  is "since his chi ldhood';'two hours' is another type of spec i f ier  (cf.Van Eynde, forthcoming).2.3.
The ca lcu lus  as a whole.In the preceding sections i t  has been st ipu latedthat there are three possible re la t ions  betweenS and R, and six possible re la t ions  between Rand E. At f i r s t  sight that seems to be rathera rb i t ra ry ,  but a careful analysis of the conceptsinvolved shows that they, in fact ,  exhaust therange of log ica l  poss ib i l i t i es  :For any tuo in terva ls  x and y c time,e i ther  x n y = 0and then e i ther  be fore ix ,y )or a f te r  (x ,y )or x n y # 0and then e i ther  x c y, i .
e .
dur ing(x ,y~or ~(x c y)and then e i ther  x = y,i .
e .
contain(x,yJor - (x  = y)and then e i ther  s ince~x,v~or unt i l  ~x,y)These are the six aspectual values.
The reasonwhy the de(eric system has only three possiblevalues is that the speech time - unl ike thereference and the event time - is always as ingleton,  and i f  one of the in terva ls  involvedis a s ingleton,  then the re la t ions  ' s ince  and'unt i l '  and e i ther  "during' or 'contain '  cannothold by de f in i t ion .
I t  appears, thus, that boththe de ic t i c  and the aspectual d i s t inc t ions  arenot only mutually exclusive but also exhaustivewithin the i r  respective domains.Together they form the core of the temporalcalculus.
This core has to be extended invarious ways i f  one wants to take intoaccount the phenomenon of i te ra t iv i ty ,  thesequence of tenses in complex sentences, andthe relevance of the event type of the basicproposit ion (of.
Vendler's d i s t inc t ion  of38states, ac t iv i t ies ,  accomplishments,achievements).
Part of th is  has already beenincorporated in the formalism, but in steadof presenting those extensions me think i tmore useful to round off this paper with ademonstration of how the calculus can be usedfor the inter l ingual  analysis of verbaltense forms.3.
The inter l ingual  analysis of tenses.For the inter l ingual  analysis of the verbaltense Torms #e adopt the following pr inc ip le:(VII)The inter l ingual  representations of verbaltense forms are pairs consisting of onedeict ic  and one aspectual value.As the number of possible combinations ofdeict ic and aspectual values is 18 (3x6), i tfollows that each tense form can have atmost 18 di f ferent inter l ingual  representations.In order to determine which values a giventense can actually have one has to examinei t s  compatibi l i ty  with the di f ferent  types oftime adverbials.As for the deict ic  subpart~ i t  is not sod i f f i cu l t  to invent a c r i te r ion :( i )I f  tense X i s  compat ib le  wi th  a de ic t i cY -adverb ia l ,  ,here  Y \[ (a f te r ,  be fore ,conta in} ,  then the tense X can have thevalue Y.For the aspectual subpart the c r i te r ia  area b i t  more complicated:( i i )IT tense X can be used in a sentence with awhen-adverbial in #hich the event is said totake place before or after the intervaldenoted by that when-adverbial, then theaspectual value of X can be either "before'or 'a f te r ' ,  i .e .
X can be used to expresseither retrospect iv i ty  or prospect ivity.
( i i i~If tense X can be used in a sentence whichcontains both a ,hen-adverbial and a durationadverbial that denotes an interval that islarger than the interval denoted by thewhen-adverbial, then tense X can be used toexpress the durative aspect.Similar c r i te r ia  have to be stated for theother aspects (inchoative, terminative, andperfective).
As far as ,e can see no# theperfective aspect might well be consideredto be the default value: from a conceptualpoint of vie# the least marked situationis the one in which the event time is containedin or identical  with the reference time(E c R or E = R).As an i l l us t ra t ion  of how these c r i te r ia  canbe used in practice we give an inter l ingualanalysis of the Dutch 'Voltooid TegenwoordigeTi jd (VTT)'.
This tense is expressed by thecombination of an aux i l ia ry  ('hebben" or' z i jn ' )  and the perfect par t i c ip le  of alexical  verb .The VTT can be combined with a l l  kinds of#hen-adverbials:(13) nu heb ik  her gevondennow-have- l - i t - found(14) morgen heb ik  her gevondentomorrow-have- I - i t - found(15) gisteren heb ik het gevondenyesterday-have-l- it-foundIn (13) and (14) the time of event precedesthe time denoted by resp.
"nu" and "morgen";hence, the aspectual value of the VTT inthese sentences is the retrospective one.In fact,  (13) and (14) belong to a paradigmof retrospective tenses.
The other membersof the paradigm are the "goltooid VerledenTi jd"  and the "Voltooid Toekomende T i jd" ,as in(Ib) gisteren had ik bet algevondenyesterday-had-l- it-already-found(17) morgen zal ik bet gevonden hebbentomorrow-shall- l- it-faund-have(14) and (17) even have the same meaning and,hence, the same inter l ingual  representation,namely the combination after - before.
(13) has the value contain - before, and(Ib) the value before - before.In (15) the situation is d i f ferent :  here, thetime of finding does not precede the intervaldenoted by "yesterday" (as in ( Ib)) ,  but israther contained in i t .
The aspectual value ofthe VTT in (16) is hence the perfective one,and the inter l ingual  representation in that caseis before - durin 9.I t  can further be sho,n that the VTT cannot beused to express a durative aspect.
Comoare(18) gisteren ben ik de hele dag ziek geweestyesterday-am-l-the-whole-day-ill-been(19) * gisteren ben ik drie dagen ziek geweestyesterday-aa-l-three-days-i l l -beenIn (18) the event time denoted by the durationadverbial "de hele dag" is a subset of theinterval denoted by "gisteren" (= perfectiveaspect); in (19), on the other hand, theevent time (three days) is said to be longerthan the reference time (one day).
Since this39combinat ion  leads to ungramaat ica l i ty  ( inDutch) ,  i t  fo l lows  that  the VTT cannot expressdurat iv i ty .I f  these analyses are cor rect ,  i t  fo l lows  thatthe Dutch VTT can have three  d i s t inc t  in ter -lingual representations: contain - before,after - before, and before - durino.The general idea now is that this informationis contained in the lexicon, and that for theassignment of temporal representations toparticular sentences one f i r s t  looks in thelexicon to see which interl ingual representationsthe tense used in that particular sentence canhave, and then singles out that subset ofrepresentations which is compatible with thetime adverbials used in the sentence.I f  that  subset conta ins  exact ly  one member thesentence may be said to be unaebiguous w i threspect  to the temporal  ca lcu lus ;  i f  the subsetcontains more members, the sentence is said tobe temporally ambiguous; and i f  the subset isempty, the sentbnce is simply not well-formed.As a conc lus ion  to  th i s  sect ion  we g ive  therepresentat ions  of some of the d iscussedsentences13) 3 S,R,E ~ t ime (conta in (R ,S )  & nu(R) &before(E ,R)  & AT (E, ik  her v inden) )15) 3 S,R,E S t ime (before(R ,S)  & g is teren(R)  &dur ing(E ,R)  & AT(E, ik  het v inden) )(18) 3 S,R,E ~ t ime (before(R ,S)  & g is teren(R)  &dur ing(E ,R)  k de he le  dag(E)& AT(E, ik ziek z i jn))Re?erencesBruce, Bertram (1972) 'A model for temporalreferences and i ts  application in aquestion answering program', inAr t i f i c ia l  Intell igence 3, 1-25.Comrie, Bernard (1976) Aspect: an intro-duction to the study o?

Prospects.In this paper we have concentrated on thedefinit ion of a conceptual calculus for therepresentation of time meanings in naturallanguage.
We have also given principles(IV,V,VI,VII) and c r i te r ia  ( i , i i , i i i )  forrelating the concepts of the calculus tolanguage specific morphosyntactic ategories.Given these tools, i t  should be possible toanalyse the tenses of the different languagesin such a way that the results of the analysisare comparable and, indeed, identical i f f  theyexpress the same concept.It  goes without saying that the actual analysisof al l  possible tenses cannot be carried outin a paper of this size, but we have thefeeling that ,e have at least cleared theground for such an enterprise.40
