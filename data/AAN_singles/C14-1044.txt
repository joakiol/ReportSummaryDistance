kate.muir@uwe.ac.uk, adam.joinson@uwe.ac.ukAbstractLinguistic accommodation is a recognised indicator of social power and social distance.
How-ever, different individuals will vary their language to different degrees, and only a portion ofthis variance will be due to accommodation.
This paper presents the Zelig Quotient, a methodof normalising linguistic variation towards a particular individual, using an author?s other com-munications as a baseline, thence to derive a method for identifying accommodation-inducedvariation with statistical significance.
This work provides a platform for future efforts towardsexamining the importance of such phenomena in large communications datasets.1 Introduction?Zelig...protects himself by becoming like whoever he is around.
?- The Narrator, Zelig (Allen, 1983)When people converse, they often become more alike in their language in many different dimensions(Garrod and Pickering, 2004).
This can include similarity in pronunciation (Giles, 1973), speech rates(Street, 1984), pause and utterance duration (Cappella, 1979), and volume (Natale, 1975).
Similarly,in written communications people often converge in terms of features such as linguistic style (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011), vocabulary, and syntax (Scissors et al., 2008).
Communication Ac-commodation Theory (Giles and Ogay, 2007) proposes that interactants can adjust their communicationstyle, such as accent, vocabulary, and use of jargon to sound more (convergence) or less (divergence) likethe other person.
Individuals typically converge to signal affinity with their interlocutor, and diverge toshow interpersonal or social distance.One area which has been largely overlooked, to date, is the role played by an individual?s inherenttendency to accommodate (or not).
We propose that some people are more apt than others to changetheir typical linguistic style to converge to that of their conversational partner.
This paper introduces theZelig Quotient, which is a new method for capturing the degree to which the variation in an individual?slanguage use can be explained by their accommodation towards the style of their interlocutor.
Using thisscore, it is then possible to measure the significance of an individual?s accommodation within a specificcommunication pair: does each individual accommodate more or less than their personal norm?In this paper, we firstly consider existing computational measures of linguistic accommodation.

Further, another area that has yet to be explored is the influence of social statusand relationships between interlocutors on the likelihood of accommodation.
We therefore demonstratethe applicability of the Zelig Quotient by applying the technique to large datasets of communicationsfrom three online community forums, in which social status and relationships between interlocutors areclearly defined.
We close with a discussion of potential future directions in which the Zelig Quotientcould be applied.1.1 Computational Measures of Linguistic AccommodationSeveral computational measures of linguistic accommodation already exist.
These measures typicallycapture the extent to which language use increases in similarity or becomes ?adapted?
either within apiece of text or between individuals in dialog.
Church (2000) developed a method for determining lexicaladaptation in text, by examining the probability of one word appearing in the later half of a documentwhen it appears in the earlier half.
This method has been used and extended by other researchers in theexamination of lexical adaptation over time (Reitter et al., 2006), adaptation of syntactic constructions(Dubey et al., 2005) and to measure the prevalence and strength of linguistic feature adaptation in dialogs(Stenchikova and Stent, 2007).
Along similar lines, linguistic style matching (LSM) techniques withLIWC measures (quantitative analysis of standard language categories) (Pennebaker et al., 2001) revealthe extent to which language use is coordinated between group members, either on a whole conversationor turn-by-turn level (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002).
Ireland et al.
(Ireland et al., 2011) usedLSM techniques to study the predictive value of stylistic similarity in a social setting.
They found thatsimilarity of a few stylistic categories (such as the distribution of pronouns and determiners) was a goodindicator of whether two individuals would vote to see one another again in a speed dating scenario.The work of Huffaker et al.
(2006) is particularly relevant to our examination of accommodationwithin online community forums.
Huffaker et al compared three different measures of lexical conver-gence to assess message similarly in an online community over time.
These included: Spearman?s RankCorrelation, which has been used to determine message similarity between corpora (Kilgarriff, 2001),?Zipping?, referring to data compression algorithms, which has been used to measure the complexity ofdocuments (Benedetto et al., 2002), and Latent Semantic Analysis, which has been used to measuresemantic similarity across corpora (Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998).
All three measures showed divergencein message similarity both between individuals, and in the community as a whole, across time.However, the common theme with all these techniques is that although they can effectively measureadaptation of linguistic feature use within and between dialogs, they fail to capture the precise directionof convergence or divergence between individuals (i.e., do both interactants within a conversational pairaccommodate their language use to the same extent?)
Thus, existing computational measures of linguisticaccommodation fail to provide a fine-grained view of the dynamics of convergence within dyads or largegroups.
The measures discussed above only capture the extent to which members of the group matchone another, and overlook precise details of an individual?s movement from their existing language usetowards that of the group.1.2 Individual?s Propensity to AccommodateFurther, whilst accommodation within dyads and groups has been measured extensively, one area whichhas been largely overlooked, to date, is the role played by an individual?s inherent tendency to accom-modate (or not).
Some individuals may have a relatively stable linguistic style, whereas other individualsmay be more likely to accommodate their linguistic style towards that of their conversational partner.We have been unable to find any methods for reliably measuring an individuals propensity to accom-modate towards their interlocutors.
We hypothesize that individuals are not equal with respect to theiraccommodation and propose the Zelig measure, detailed within this paper, as a means for quantifyingthis characteristic.One factor which could conceivably influence an individual?s tendency to accommodate is socialpower.
Giles and Coupland (1991) state that ?the power variable is one that emerges a number oftimes in the accommodation literatures and in ways that support the model?s central predictions?
(p.456Category Examples Category ExamplesPersonal pronouns I, his, their Auxillary verbs shall, be, wasImpersonal pronouns it, that, anything High-frequency adverbs very, rather, justArticles a, an, the Negations no, not, neverConjunctions and, but, because Quantifiers much, few, lotsPrepositions in, under, aboutTable 1: Word Categories Used for Calculating Linguistic Style19).
Demonstrations of the role of social power in accommodation include interviewees converging theirspeech style towards that of their interviewers during employment interviews (Willemyns et al., 1997),students accommodating their verbal and non-verbal behaviours to academic faculty members (Joneset al., 1999) and witnesses in courtrooms accommodating to the linguistic style of the questioning legalprofessional (Gnisci, 2005).
Thus, individuals with low social power are more likely to accommodatetheir linguistic style.
The Zelig Quotient allows explicit examination of research questions of this natureconcerning accommodation and divergence associated with demographic variables such as social power.2 The Zelig Quotient?Wanting only to be liked, he distorted himself beyond measure.
?- The Narrator, Zelig (Allen, 1983)We propose the Zelig Quotient, a measure for normalizing linguistic variation.
The Zelig Quotient isnamed for Leonard Zelig, the central character of the Woody Allen film Zelig, who is described as ?thehuman chameleon?
due to his propensity for taking on the characteristics of other people.
This is thelogical extreme of accommodating to one?s audience.
An author who always adopts the language styleof the intended reader is totally Zelig-like, whereas an author who does not adapt at all has zero likeness.Opposite behaviour to Zelig (moving away from the audience) is also possible.
Over-accommodationoccurs when the author adopts elements of linguistic style of their intended reader, but emphasises to thepoint of overuse.
In extreme cases this would be detected as parody.
We need, therefore, to distinguishnot only the distance between author and reader, but also the orientation.
The Zelig Quotient thus showsthe extent to which an individual changes their linguistic style from their ?typical?
or baseline style,to move either towards or away from each of their conversational partners.
The average Zelig scoreacross all conversational partners can then be used to demonstrate the individual?s general tendency toaccommodate their language use to that of others.2.1 Feature SelectionWe have selected to study a set of features which are stylistic rather than semantic in nature; althoughconsideration of whether two people are talking about the same topic is a valid research question, wecurrently wish to focus on their linguistic style.
The best features for our purposes are those able to bevaried with comparative freedom, without affecting the meaning of a message.
We use a set of nine suchfeatures, taken from the linguistic style matching study conducted by Ireland et al.
(2011) (see Table 1).We used LIWC dictionaries for each category.
LIWC processes a text file word by word, comparingeach word to the dictionary and providing a count of the words in the file which match each category inthe dictionary.
Sums of words in each category are presented as percentage of total words in the file tocorrect for differences in text length between text files (Pennebaker et al., 2001).
The use of LIWC isthe basis of much recent work on linguistic style accommodation (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002;Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011) to which we want torelate.4572.2 Calculating the Zelig QuotientWe assume an author has a baseline linguistic style resulting in a baseline value for each of our stylisticfeatures.
However, we expect variation in the observed values due to sampling, an author?s natural vari-ation, constraints of message content and format, etc.
as well as any movement due to accommodation.We can estimate a baseline value for a specific feature, ?f, by averaging over all the messages we havefor an author a.
Previous research has used a similar technique for establishing the baseline level of alexical item in a dialog in order to study accommodation (Church, 2000; Stenchikova and Stent, 2007).
?f(a) =na?m=1fm(a)/na(1)where m is a message, nais the number of messages for a and fm(a) is the feature value in m.We can further estimate the proportion of variance due to ?noise?
and that due to accommodation byalso calculating the average feature values on an author-reader (a, r) pairwise basis.f(a, r) =nar?m=1fm(a, r)/nar(2)where naris the number of messages written by a to reader r.Measuring the variance within a pair and then averaging over all pairs that author is party to gives anestimate of the natural variation in feature value for an author.
?2f(a) =1Ra?rnar?m=1(fm(a)?
?f(a))2/nar(3)where Rais the number of recipients of messages from author a.The movement in a feature due to accommodation is simply taken to be the difference between thevalue seen within a communicative pair, and the author?s baseline value.Having calculated scores for several features, some of which may change more readily than others,we can consider authors as having corresponding points in an F-dimensional feature space described bythe vector of feature values.
The generalised phenomenon of accommodation can then be measured interms of movement in this feature space, rather than movement in individual features.
Note that to avoidbias towards particular features when considering overall movement, feature scales must be comparable.Movement in an author?s language may be large, but it may not necessarily be towards the reader.We represent movement and distances between the author?s baseline position, accommodated position,and the reader?s position as vectors in the feature space:?
= {?1(a), ?2(a), ..., ?F(a)}a = {f1(ar), f2(a, r), ..., fF(a, r)}r = {f1(r), f2(r), ..., fF(r)}We use the law of cosines to yield the cosine of the angle between the vector connecting the readerto the author?s baseline position, and that connecting the reader to the author?s accommodated position.The angle will be greater than 90?if the author has over-accommodated, and will therefore have anegative cosine value.
However, the dot product of these two vectors gives the cosine of the inner angle.Therefore, normalising by this gives a value of +/- 1 according to whether accommodation movement isless or more than the amount required to meet the reader.Multiplying the accommodated distance by this +/-1 factor gives us a definition of an accommodationmetric that expresses the accommodation as the change in directed distance from the reader, proportionalto the amount required from the author?s unaccommodated position.
This may be greater than 1 (over-accommodation) or less than zero (divergence).
In vector notation we define accommodation as:Acc(a, r) = 1?
(| ~ar|| ~?r|)(| ~?r|2+ | ~ar|2?
| ~?a|22( ~?r ?
~ar))(4)458The dot product of ~?r and ~ar is zero if the two vectors are orthogonal.
However this is matched by azero value in the numerator and we take the final parentheses value in equation (4) to be 1 in this case.In the other pathological case where | ~?r| is zero, the implication is that author and reader have the samepreferred position, i.e.
there is nothing meaningful to say about accommodation between the two.Having estimated author to reader accommodation, we are now in a position to estimate how readilythe author adapts to others, by averaging over the set of readers.
This gives us our Zelig factor, Z.Zelig(a) =1RaRa?r=11?
(| ~ar|| ~?r|)(| ~?r|2+ | ~ar|2?
| ~?a|22( ~?r ?
~ar))(5)A positive (+) Zelig Quotient signifies the author readily accommodates, with a Zelig Quotient of 1indicating the author always adapts their linguistic style to that of their audience.
A negative (-) ZeligQuotient suggests divergence in the authors linguistic style (moving away from the audience).Significance of values can be estimated from the variance.
Here we take movement beyond one stan-dard deviation of the authors total message distribution.
The significance of an author?s Zelig Quotientthen follows from averaging the variance seen over the pairs the author is party to.Zeligmin(a) =????1RaRa?r=1?Ff=1(?f(a)?
?f(a))2?Ff=1(f(r)?
?f(a))2(6)This model assumes that there are latent baseline distributions for feature values but does not suggesta generative function.
Further work will determine appropriate distribution models for features, to beparameterised from the estimation methods presented here.3 Zelig in Online CommunicationsTo demonstrate the utility of the Zelig Quotient, our study uses scraped forum data from three largeonline communities (note, the names of the forums have been anonymised to protect the identity of thecommunity members).The first (ForumA) contains circa 2800 threads, 21000 posts, 250 currently active members and threeyears of historical data.
The second (ForumB) contains approximately 160,000 threads, 2.25 millionposts, 1500 currently active members and historical data is available for a period of approximately 10years.
The third (ForumC) contains approximately 50,000 threads, 550,000 posts, and currently 824active members.
Historical data is available for a period of approximately seven years.All three of the online community forums are powered by vBulletin, a system which allows users toearn reputation points for their activity.
Users can ?up-vote?
or ?down-vote?
each others?
posts, whicheither adds or subtracts reputation points from that user.
The number of reputation points received ordeducted depends on who is casting their up/down-vote.
Having more reputation enables a voter to havea greater influence on the reputation of others.
Reputation can also be earned as the number of posts madeby a user, or the age of their account, increases.
This system essentially enables a power structure withinthe community, and is useful for differentiating between veteran communities members who contributea lot to the community and, based on their up-votes, have a considerable amount of expertise or valuableinformation/opinions to share (i.e.
Leaders), from relatively new and inexperienced community memberswhose contributions are less significant (i.e.
Non-Leaders).From each community we sample the top 10% of all members from the complete historical data(ForumA n = 70, ForumB n = 98, ForumC n = 169) based on reputation score and assign them to our?Leader?
category.
For our ?Non-Leader?
category we select an equally sized sample group (same n),which are evenly distributed across the remaining 90%, based on reputation score.
One-time posterswere removed prior to sampling.3.1 HypothesesWe hypothesise that, in accordance with Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles and Ogay,2007), the Zelig Quotients for high power individuals (which we will refer to as Leaders) and low power459Figure 1: Moving average for an individual?s linguistic feature useindividuals (referred to as Non-Leaders) will differ significantly.
The power variable has been shown tohave a strong influence on communication accommodation.
Since people with lower status have greatercause to try to gain social approval by converging towards others, we hypothesise that:H1: Non-Leaders (i.e.
people with low power) will exhibit greater linguistic style accommoda-tion/more Zelig-like behaviour than Leaders (people with high power)Furthermore, it has been shown that those with low power often show greater convergence whencommunicating with somebody in a superior position.
For example, foremen converge more to managersthan to workers, and managers converge more to higher managers than to foremen (Taylor et al., 1978).Similarly, salespeople converge more to customers than vice versa, as the customers in these settingshold greater economic power (Van den Berg, 1986).H2: People accommodate more with interlocutors who have higher power (Leaders) than those whohave lower power (Non-Leaders)3.2 MethodOne challenge when working with scraped data from online community discussion threads, is accuratelyreconstructing who is talking to whom.
Unlike in e-mail communication, vBulletin forums lack a mech-anism for explicitly stating who a post is a reply to.
Posters therefore append their post to the end ofan ever-growing thread, regardless of whether they are addressing the first post, last post or any post inbetween.
Of course, their communication may not even be aimed at any single person, and instead mightbe intended for a whole community audience.Since the Zelig measure we have presented requires dyadic comparisons of linguistic style features, itis necessary to reconstruct a dyadic conversation structure for all of the forum threads.
Previous workhas examined features for accurate reply reconstruction of threaded conversations (Aumayr et al., 2011);re-building the correct structure from a collapsed conversation thread without explicit reply mechanisms.Many features are useful for reply graph reconstruction, for example: reply distance (how closely a postappears to that which it is responding), time difference (how soon after a post a response is written),quotation links (how explicit citations of previous posts are used) and cosine similarity (how closelythe contents of two posts match).
Aumayr et al.
(2011) demonstrated that accuracy (as indicated bymeasurements of precision and recall) can be achieved by simply combining the use of reply distanceand quotation links.
That is to say, posts are typically responses to those which they appear closest towithin a thread, or those which they explicitly cite.
Therefore, for our analysis we treat each post as aresponse to the author of the closest post (the one directly preceding it within the thread) or the authorthat is cited within the post.In order to calculate variations in each individuals?
linguistic style, we calculate their baseline style asthe moving average of their previous communications (either globally or within each particular dyad).Figure 1 illustrates this moving average for a particular LIWC feature changing with each message sentby an individual.
Our moving average approach has the advantage that accommodation is calculatedaccording to the movement towards a persons?
linguistic style at a given point in time, rather than simplyan average of their linguistic style in their entire communications (including those that occur later).460Figure 2: Zelig Quotient Distributions for members of Forum A, Forum B and Forum C4 ResultsFigure 2 shows the frequency distributions of Zelig Quotients for individuals within each of the threecommunities.Our results show that the Zelig Quotients of community members follow a relatively normal distribu-tion, centered around a Zelig Quotient of approximately -0.4 in all three communities, though there areobvious differences between the Zelig Quotient distributions for our two sample groups of Leaders vs.Non-Leaders.Our analysis reveals that divergent communication is a common behaviour for a large proportion ofeach online community.
That is, many community members receive a negative Zelig Quotient.
Ourresults, therefore, go against the prevailing findings in linguistics and psychology, which suggest thatindividuals often constitute themselves as a community, speaking in a collective voice, and convergingin terms of linguistic style.4.1 Divergence is commonWithin communication accommodation theory, convergence is generally regarded as positive and di-vergence as negative.
Divergent communicators are often evaluated as insulting, impolite, and hostile(Bradac and Giles, 2005).
Convergent speakers are evaluated as more competent, attractive, likeable andcooperative (Giles et al., 1991).
Divergence is the typically the result of communicators wanting to dif-ferentiate themselves from each other and emphasize distinct identities.
This can be the case particularlywhere there are power or status differences between interlocutors, as individuals attempt to communi-cate their social differences by engaging in dissimilar communication behaviours (Street, 1991).
If their461points of view start deviating, so too do their communication styles (McPherson et al., 2001).
Observingthe Zelig distribution of a community is therefore likely to provide a valuable insight into the overall?unity?
of its members.
Our results are consistent with Huffaker et al.
(2006), who found increasingdissimilarity with the words used by community forum users over a six-week period.
Thus, our resultssuggest that a large proportion of individuals within online communities have a tendency to differentiatethemselves from others.However, divergent communication is not always inherently negative.
Attributions of the speaker?smotives by the recipient can influence the extent to which convergent and divergent communicationsare perceived to be positive or negative.
For instance, convergence can be evaluated as positive whenattributed to speaker?s internal positive motives; however convergence can also be viewed negativelywhen attributed to external factors.
The same is true for divergent communications.
When divergence isperceived by the recipient as being unintentional or positively motivated, recipients evaluate the speakerand their communications more favourably than if it is evaluated as being intentional or negatively mo-tivated (Gasiorek and Giles, 2012).
Thus, divergent communication does not neccessarily have negativeconnotations for the relationship between speakers and recipients.Whilst linguistic style convergence does occur within the communities we have examined, a relativelysmall proportion of members (typically less than 10%) demonstrate a tendency to accommodate to othersin a near Zelig-like way.
A larger proportion of each community (between 15 - 35%) tend to maintaintheir typical linguistic style, with their Zelig Quotient of 0 indicating that fluctuations in style are due tonoise rather than convergence or divergence.The following results describe in more detail the differences in Zelig Quotients for our two samplegroups, Leaders and Non-Leaders.4.2 Non-Leaders are more Zelig-like than LeadersWe conducted independent samples t-tests in order to compare the Zelig Quotient means for Leaders andNon-Leaders in each of the online communities.
There were common significant differences across allthree communities: Non-Leaders in ForumA had significantly greater Zelig Quotients (M= -0.181, SD=0.270) than Leaders (M= -0.432, SD= 0.148); t(119)= 6.492, p< 0.001.
Similarly, ForumB Non-Leaders(M= -0.345, SD= 0.425) were more Zelig-like than Leaders (M= -0.461, SD= 0.254); t(206)= 2.346, p<0.05, and ForumC Non-Leaders (M= -0.306, SD= 0.276), were also more Zelig-like than Leaders (M=-0.468, SD= 0.121); t(327)= 6.885, p < 0.001.These results lead us to accept H1; Non-Leaders?
linguistic style variation can be attributed to theiraccommodation towards the style of their interlocutor, to a greater degree than for Leaders.
Furthermore,our results illustrate that analysis using the Zelig Quotient uncovers important accommodation trendswithin textual conversation data, which are in accordance with Communication Accommodation Theory.As well as a comparison between high and low reputation groups (Leaders and Non-Leaders, respec-tively), a Spearman?s Rank Order correlation was run to determine the relationship between reputationrank and Zelig rank within the community.
We found weak but statistically significant negative corre-lations between reputation and Zelig Quotient within ForumB (rs(316) = -0.1406, p = 0.011889) andForumC (rs(179) = -0.1729, p = 0.019863), further suggesting that Zelig-like behaviour is most commonwithin the lowest reputation ranks.4.3 Interactions between Leaders and Non-LeadersIn order to test H2 and examine how interactions between Leaders and Non-Leaders influenced accom-modation, each individual within a dyad was classified as either communicating ?Up?
or ?Down?
thereputation hierarchy (either from Non-leader to Leader, or Leader to Non-Leader, respectively).
Inde-pendent samples t-tests were conducted in order to compare the mean Zelig Quotients for dyads fromeach category.
The tests revealed a statistically significant difference within two of the three communi-ties, with Zelig Quotients significantly lower in ?downward?
communications for ForumA - Upwards (n= 72, M= -0.283 , SD= 0.456), Downwards (n = 72, M= -0.588, SD= 0.711); t(142)= 3.066, p< 0.01, andForumC - Upwards (n=1280, M= -0.388, SD= 0.570), Downwards (n=1280, M= -0.530, SD= 0.723);t(2558)= 5.528, p < 0.001.
Within ForumB, those communicating up the hierarchy were also more462Zelig-like, however the difference was considered not to be statistically significant - Upwards (n=295,M= -0.383, SD= 0.634), Downwards (n=295, M= -0.444, SD= 0.601); t(588)= 1.208, p = 0.228.These results lead us to accept H2; community members are more Zelig-like when communicatingwith people above them in terms of reputation/status.4.4 Finding the Zeligs: Who are they?To conclude our analysis, we address the question: ?Who are the Zelig characters within our corpora?
?.By focusing our attention on the individuals that have positive Zelig values (Z > 0), our results pointto a clear and consistent answer across all three datasets - almost all Zelig-like individuals are Non-Leaders, however, Non-Leaders are not all Zeligs.
Within our sample populations for each communityNon-Leaders account for the vast majority of those with Zelig values greater than 0 (100% in ForumA,91.6% in ForumB, and 100% in ForumC).
These results are consistent with the idea that individualswith lower power are sensitive to the language used by a higher power interlocutor (Niederhoffer andPennebaker, 2002); the Zelig Quotient has captured the greater tendency of Non-Leaders to alter theirbaseline linguistic style in order to converge with the linguistic style of Leaders, instead of the other wayaround.The Zelig-like behaviour of non-leaders could potentially be attributable to their acclimatisation tocommunity expectations; shifting their behaviour more frequently at the earliest stages of their commu-nity life and converging more towards the linguistic styles of others, until they gradually stabilise andbecome more attuned to the community norms, perhaps even progressing to leadership roles themselves.A useful future investigation would be to track the progress of the Zelig-like Non-Leaders over time, tosee if their propensity to adapt and change their linguistic style affects their ability to progress withinthe community, e.g.
does linguistic style convergence enable them to earn reputation more quickly, orprovide an indicator of longevity within the community?5 Conclusions and Future Work?...and it shows exactly what you can do if you?re a total psychotic.
?- Leonard Zelig, Zelig (Allen, 1983)We have presented a metric for measuring linguistic accommodation in a systematic manner, consid-ering not only the context of an individual pair?s communications, but the background models for bothindividuals.
Thus, the Zelig Quotient provides an objective, quantifiable measure of convergence anddivergence in language use between individuals, as defined by the movement in an individual?s typicallinguistic style towards or away from the typical linguistic style of their conversational partner.
The ZeligQuotient is meaningful for differentiating between those who typically accommodate their language usetowards many people (Zelig-like individuals) from those who don?t.
In addition, the metric includescalculation of pair-wise author to reader accommodation scores.
Thus, a full picture of how an indi-vidual is behaving in terms of convergence and divergence can be gained by examining these pair-wisescores.
In combination, these two scores together provide a comprehensive and illuminating picture of anindividual?s accommodation behaviour.
This provides a framework for investigating the circumstancessurrounding such variation in language use, over large datasets, in a manner which has not previouslybeen undertaken.We acknowledge that community forums such as these may not be the ideal dataset for evaluatingdyadic accommodation, as authors may be addressing multiple people.
However, it is worth noting theuse of the Zelig metric seems to be effective even in this community forum dataset.
Work on testingthe metric on a wide range of existing datasets, including courtroom interactions and dyadic therapeuticinteractions, is ongoing.There are a number of additional possibilities for future work.
Firstly, although in the current studywe focussed on linguistic features that are stylistic in nature, it would be simple to alter the Zelig metricto use greater, fewer or entirely different linguistic features, for instance to explore semantic or contentaspects of language.
We have so far considered only a small set of linguistic style features, and it maybe worth expanding this to a greater variety; in particular, concentrating on features which have been463shown to be the subject of accommodation in sociolinguistic studies (such as Bunz & Campbell, 2004).We also intend to test the metric with languages other than English in future research.
Secondly, theseparation between our two sample groups in terms of Zelig distributions suggests that this Quotientmay be useful as a predictor of group membership/reputation score.
A considerable body of work hasattempted to accurately classify community members based on their communication behaviours andour results suggest that Zelig may be useful in this domain.
We also intend to investigate in moredetail what kinds of relationships are characterized by higher levels of accommodation, to see whetherthis accords with underpinning theories of politeness and social identity.
Group dynamics, includinglinguistic accommodation to group norms in multiparty communication, and the individual?s contributionto constructing a group identity, is also a large area ripe for further study.ReferencesErik Aumayr, Jeffrey Chan, and Conor Hayes.
