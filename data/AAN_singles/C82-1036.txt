1982APPROACHES TO THESAURUS PRODUCTIONA.
qichiels, d. No~l, Fnglish DepartmentUniversity of LiegePlace Cockeri l l ,  3,B-4000 LiegeBelgiumWe contrast two approaches to thesaurus production : thetraditional and intuitive one versus the Amsler-typeprocedure, which interactively 9,enerates filiations amongthe genus words in a computerized dictionary.
We discussthe application of such a orocedure to our lexical database (LONDON DICTIONARY OF CONTEdPORARY ENGLISH).I INTRODUCTIONSince 1979 we have had avai lable,  by contract with LON~,I/uN Ltd, the c(:mputer tapeof LDOCE (IDNCUqN DICTIO~NARY OF CONrlT/'IPOP~LRY \[iNGLISH).
Our main concern has beenthe development of a syntactico-semantic analyzer of general "English making fulluse of all the formatted information contained in our dictionary file.
(\lichielset al 1980; ~lichiels 1982).LDOCE is a medit~a-sized dictionary of core English containing some 60,OO0 entrieswhich feature the following types of information :a) fully formalizedPart of speech (POS)Grammatical fields, i.e.
sets of grarmnatical codes, which describe theenvironment that the code-bearing item can or must fit in.l%%at makes these grammatical fields particularly suitable for the purposes ofmachine disambiguation of natural language is that they are assigned to word-senses (definitions) as well as to whole lexical entries.
An example is providedby the LDOCE entry CONSIDER (p. 233).in the example, stringI consider you a foolthe two-NP chain ( YOU A FOOL ) satisfies the \[XI~ code associated with theNP I NP 2second definition of the verb and enables the analyzer to select the appropriatedefinition in context ("scanning procedures" : cf.

I08).
A first step towards formalizing definitions has been taken by the LD(XIElericographers : all the LIX)C~ examples and definitions are written in acontrolled defining vocabulary of some 2,100 items (lexemes - e.g.
HISTORY - andmorphemes - e.g.
RE- and -IZATION - no morphological variants).Our concern in this paper will be with how to produce thesauri from dictionaryfiles.
What prompts us to examine this problem is the existence of two contrastingapproaches to thesaurus-production : the first is exemplified by LOLHX (LON6MANLEXICON OF CONTEMPORARY 19~GLISH, J 981 ), the second by Amsler 1980.I I  THESAURUS PRODUCTIONAlthough LOLEX takes over a subset of the ~ definitions, both the choice ofthesauric categories (e.g.J.212 verbs : DISMISSING AhD Rh-TIRING PEOPLE) and theassignment of a lexical item to one of several categories (e.g.
DISBAND assignedto J.
212) are based on the lexicographer's intuition and knowledge of prcvlouswork in the field (cf.
l~get's, etc.
).Amsler's approach is totally different (see Amsler 1980) : using as data base thecomputer files of the MPD (Merriam Pocket Dictionary) prepared by John O\]ney(Olrtey 1968), he develops an interactive procedure for thesaurus production.
Thefirst step is a manual selection and disambiguation of the GHqUS TEI~4S in thedefinitions of nouns and verbs.
By GENUS TERM is to be understood the first wordof the definition which has the same POS as the definiendum a~d can serve as itssuperordinate.
For example, in the first definition of HAMMER, the genus term isSTRIKE, whereas in the fifth it is DECLARE.It should be realized t~hat genus term and syntactic head do not always coincide,and this mismatch is a major obstacle in the development of autocratic proceduresfor genus term selection.
Contrast in this respect tho first and the second homo-graphs of the LDOCE headword BOA (page IO5).
The second poses no problem :syntactic head and genus term are identical (GARMENT)?
In the first, however, thegenus term is lodged inside the second OF-phrase,itself embedded in the first,which in its turn depends on the syntactic head ANY.Once they have been selected, the genus terms are disambiguated with reference tothe data base itself by selecting the appropriate homograph and definitionnumbers.
A convenient example, drawn from LDOCE, ~s the disambiguation of  thegenus term CONSIDER in the definitions of LOOK ON (L X 9 esp.
as, wit~: toconsider; regard) CONSIDER here will be disambiguated as CONSIDER (m, 2) (~ = non ?honDgraphic, 2 = second definition - cf.
LDOCE entry CONSIDER, po 253)The next  s tep  i s  the  use o f  a t ree-growing a lgor i thm,  which Amsler has  progr~edand applied to his MPD data base.
It is based on a filiation technique betweenl~xical entries and genus terms.
We shall illustrate it with respect to the itemVEHICLE (x, 1 ) in our own data base.
Descending the filiation path, the procedurewill select all the items which use ~he word V~HICLE (w, 1 ) as genus term in theirdefinitions.
Among these are CAR (x,'I/2/3) and CARRIAGE (x, I/2/7).
CARRIAGE intm'n functions as a genus term and yields its own sub-class, which contains, mnongothers, the items BROUGHAM (x, x - non-homographic + a single definition) andGIG (1,1) - which are themselves defined by means of the genus term CARRIAGE.
Inour example, the procedure stops at B ~  alxl GIG because these lexical i~-~sare  nowhere in  the ~Ct i~ used as ~ terms.

Even i f  one isprepared to consider S(MEI~ING as the genus term (relaxing the HIS ident i tycondit ion) ,  the thesaur ic  l ink that  i s  obtained does not y ie ld  more informationthan the semantic odes associated with the re levant  de f in i t ion .A c lear  advantage of  ~ns le r ' s  procedure over in tu i t i ve  thesaurus-product ion (asexemplif ied in LOLIK) i s  that  i t  can lead to an i~provement of  the d ict ionary database that  is  used as source.

To give an example, ~ defines LIMOUSINE by memos of the genus termSEDAN.Level one : VI~ICI~Level two : AUTCHOBILELevel three : 'SEDANLevel four : LIMOUSIN?

carThe shallow hierarchies based on LDOCE definitions are no doubt less revealing forthe purpose of thesauric organisation.
But the use of a controlled definingvecabulary makes i t  easier to process dictionary definitions in terms of both :I ) auto~mtizing enus term selection and disambiguation and2) parsing whole definition strings (as opposed to I )This is because the lexicon that the parser must have access to can be determinedin advance.
I t  is NOT open-ended (open-ended means, practically, as extensive asthe defined vecabulary, i .e.
the whole l i s t  of dictionary entries - cf.
Amsler1980, p. TOg).Schematically, the decision to use a controlled vocabulary to write dictionarydefinitions can have three undesirable consequences :I ) .
-  reduction of the amount of information conveyed by the definition : OVERUSEof i~ l i c i t l y  or expl ic i t ly  partial definitions (in the sense of Bierwisch &Kiefer 1969, p. 66-68) - the latter are incomplete definitions which wear230 A. MICHIELS and J. NOeLthe i r  incompleteness on the i r  s leeve,  for em~ple :TARANqIF~ : spider of  a cer ta in  kind.2) .
-  semantic overloading of a l l -purpose items such as GET, HAVE) MAKE, TAKE, etc .E.g.
K~P (1, 8) : to have for  some time or for more time (LDOCE, p~ 605)3) .
-  uncontro l led increase in s>ntact ic  omplexity in the d i f fe rent ia  {non-genuspart  of  the def in i t ion)  :a) degree of  embedding - not only in c lauses ,  but a lso - and perhaps moreimportantly - in complex nominal groups (cf.
Amsler 1980, p. 108 on ANT-EATING in the definition of AARDVARK)b) anaphoric relationsc) scope relations (conjunction plays a pr~inent part here)Compare the following two definitions of INSULINi) .- OALDOCE (Hornby 1980~ - 18 wordssubsta~e (a hormone ) prepared from the pancreas ~ of sheep used in themedical treatment of sufferers from diabetes ~(M = does not belong to the LDOCE defining vocabulary).ii) .- LDOCE - 37 wordsa substance produced naturally in the body which allows sugar to be used forENEI~GY, esp.
such a substance taken frc~ sheep to be given to sufferers froma disease (DIABETES) which makes them lack this substance.
(ENI~GY and DIABETES in capital letters because not in LDOCE definingvocabulary).This third consequence stems from the avoidance of non-defining vocabulary itemsby means of P ~ E ,  which displaces the burden towards syntactic elaboration,a point cogently made in Ralph 1980 (p. 117).This "grammaticalization" of much of the information conveyed by LDOCE dictionarydefinitions points to the need to analyse whole definition strings rather thanjust the genus terms (see the process of ANNOTATING dictionary definitions in No~let al 1981).Before we consider how to tackle the problem of disambiguating definition strings,we must examine a much easier way of retrieving at least some thesauric links fromthe LDOCE dictionary file.
The LDOCE lexicographers sometimes provide ready-madethesauric links :I ).-cross-reference to an item belonging to the defining vocabulary :CAPTAIN (2, ~() : to be captain of; c ~ ;synonyms2) .

1981 we have shown the power of  the IDOCEgrmmnatical codes to disambiguate items in context, more specifically in thecontext provided by the definition strings themselves.
For instance, in the LDOCEdefinition ~ ~ (~, DAPPROACHES TO THESAURUS PRODUCTION 231- a wicked person who leads ~__ple t.o__dg._wf.ong or harms those who are kind tohimthe annotating process will select the V3 code for LEADS, because it occurs inthe syntactic envirorrnent NP + TO + VP (NP = poople, VP = do wrong) defined byV3 .
This assigrBnent enables the system to reject all the word senses for LEADin LDOCE except the appropriate one (one out of nine; cf.
entry L~I  page 622).We would like here to put forward a further possible exploitation of the LDOCEgrammatical codes for the purpose of dissmbiguating dictionary definitions.
Itapplies to genus terms and consists in the selection of a preferred word-sensefor the genus term on the basis of a similarity in grarmnatical code betweendefiniens and genus term.
Let us turn back to our fourth example, the entryLOOK ON (2, ~).
The first genus term is CONSIDP~R.
LOOK ON is assigned thegranmmtical cede X9 .
The second def in i t ion  of  CONSIDER is assigned theX (to be) 1, 7 code.
The s imi lar i ty  in grammatical code X serves as c r i te r ionto disambiguate CONSIDER in the def in i t ion  of LOOK ON as CONSIDER (x) 2).The LDOCE semantic and subject codes can be exploited in a similar way.
It can behypothesized that the combined use of all the formalized information types inLDOCE will prove to have a high disambiguating power and turn out to be a usefultool for the setting up of thesauric classes.A last point that we wish to touch on concerns the nature of the genus terms in adictionary data base which makes use of a controlled defining vocabulary.
Thegrmmnaticalization of information due to paraphrase in LDOCE gives rise to aspecial distribution of genus terms along a FULL WORD PROFORM gradient.FULL WORDLIQUID SUBSTANCEANALYSIS(hyponym superordinate)PROFOI~4SCMETHINGANYTHINGcf.
LDOCE def.

When the point is reached where the genus term doesnot provide more specific information than the semantic codes assigned to thedefiniendun, two conclusions can be drawn :1 ).- the lexicographers of the source c~ictionary must consider whether theirdefinition is appropriate, as it does not show the thesauric linksperspicuously;2) .- the whole definition string must be processed and disambiguated, so as toretrieve the information that a dictionary which does not use a controlleddefining vocabulary would have included in the genus term.At the same time, the analysis of whole definition strings will reveal a numberof thesauric links (such as that between INSTR\[lqENT and ACTION discussed inMiqhiels et al 1980) that the study of genus terms, limited to the HYPONYM-~/PERORDINATE relation, is unable to retrieve.232 A.
