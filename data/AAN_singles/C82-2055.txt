ON MEANING IN THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL S~ANTICSJo rdan Psnchev, V lad lml r  Per l c l levIns t i tu te  fo r  Bu lgar ian  LanguageChapaev 52, Sofia, BulgariaTheoret i ca l  semant ics  i s  concerned with the  mode l l ing  o fmeaning proper ,  and computat iona l  semant ics  (natura l  languageunders tand ing  sys tems,  machine t rans la t ion ,  d ia loguesys tems) ,  w i th  the mode l l ing  of  communicat ive meaning, ormeaning as used purposefully by people in communication ("Byuttering X with meaning proper Y the speaker intends a commun-icative maning Z').
The distinction between meaning properand communicative meaning Is difficult to make since in every-d~7 apeech~ which is the only observable manifestation ofmeaning, people are apt to confuse the thing Itself with whatit is intended to stand for as well as for some other reasons(e.g.
that both meanings are slmultaneosly acquired In ourchildhood).
It is clearly cutj however, in forelgn languageacquisition.
In foreigh language acquisition people learn themeanings of words and expressions rather than how these mean-ings are used for the purposes of communlcatlon~ since in thegeneral case, the letter Is part of their own native languageknowledge.
This explains wh~ we speak that for a Bulgarian tohave learned the meaning of the English I wa~t to sleep is tohave learned that in Bulgarian It has meaning equivalents llke~skam da sDda~ ~ etc., and not to have learned that incommunicative acts the former English sentence may be puPpose-fully used b~ the speaker wlth the Intention of stating thathe (she) is willing to sleep, or urging someone to leave hlm(her) alone so that he (she) can sleep, and so on.
Furthermore~- 226 -we can imagine s i tuat ions  In  which one knows the communicat-ive meanlng of a language express ion  without  knowing I t smeaning proper .Communicative meaning lles at the basis of our intuitiveunder~tandlng of language.
Understanding of language crucial-1.y depends upon different mental processing accomplished bynat ive  speakers such as exp l i ca t ing  Imp l i c i t  connect ions  insentences ,  log ica l  deducing (Schank, Rieger)  e tc .
S t r i c t lyspeak ing,  th i s  p rocess ing  does not Invo lve meaning proper andas such As not a part of linguistics.
In this sense, theclaim made In ore.rant semantic theories that linguistic se-mantics should e3plaln the In~It lve understanding of thelanguage by native speakers Is not true, unless, of course,the notion of llngulatlc meaning Is extended to meanlnglees-ness .In  the  paper ,  some cases o f  unacceptab le  concept ions  o fl ingu is t i c  meaning In  the  works o f  semant ic  theor l s ts  a red i scussed .For  fu r ther  exp l i ca t ion  o f  the  d i f fe rence  between mean-lng  proper  and communicat ive  meaning ( In  the  sense above)classes of amblgultIes are discussed which have differentmeaning proper but still their different semantic representat-Ions preserve the same communicative meanlnE.
These classes ofambiguities share the same (l) referent, (Ii) Implication,(Ill) presupposition, or (iv) present communicative equivalentsIn a less well-deflned way.In the paper, It Is noted that, In addition to deepeningIts concept of semantics along the lines of studylng commun-Icative mean?ng, as an applied science, computer llnguistlossearches for strategies avoiding ~ather than solving some ofIts most difficult semantical problems.
:Two such s t ra teg ies  a r~d lscussed .
One I s  concerned withthe tack l ing  of  the ambigui ty  between marked and unmarkedlex lca l  i tems.
In  the  o ther ,  I t  I s  proposed that  Ins tead  of- 227-t ry ing  to reso lve  some cases of A. Syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty ,and B. Semant ical  ambiguity in  the ana lys i s  (e .g .
fo r  thepurposes o f  MT), sentences  are synthes ized  An the ta rgetlanguase which are syntact i ca l ly  ambiguous ( in  the samesense) ,  so  that  the user  h imse l f ,  ra ther  than the l ingu is t i cane lyser ,  reso lves  the ambigu i t ies  in  quest ion .A.
