Syntactical functions of RUMORS rely onword-order ~nd dependency d~t~ as input informa-tion.
The synthesizer is implemented on IBM PC,MS DOS, in Turbo Pascal.1 General informationThe RUMORS system of RUssian MORphologiculand Syntactical synthesis has been developed as partof the JaRAP experimental system of Jt~p~nese-Russian antoma~tic tra~sl~tion, described in (Mod-ina,Shaly~pin~,1994).
Its operation is, however, com-pletely independent of the other components of theJatl2kP system, so that RUMORS could be used inany other AT system irrespective of its source l~n-guage.
Basically, RUMORS constitutes a system inits own right, which can also be used for purposesother th~n tra~nsl~tion, e.g., as ~ computerized refer-ence book of Russian morphology and the simplestphenomena of syntactic government a~td agreement(for students and teachers of Russian), ~ part ofspell-checking system, etc.The RUMORS synthesizer has two m~jor modes ofoper~tlon: the QUERY mode ttnd the TASK mode.In the QUERY mode of operr~tion, ItUMOItSaccepts, as its input, a separate syntactico-morphological query (entered from the keybo~Lrd)which represents the lexeme to be processed ~nd thesynttmtlcal.~.nd morphological charaeteristics specify-lag the word-form to be obtained by the processing.The output is, primarily, the desired word-form of theinput lexeme or, if necessary, ~periphrastic ~u6stitutefor this word-form.After obtaining this output, the user c~t switchat will to the FULL PARADIGM submode of theQUERY mode.
In this submode, RUMORS gener-~rte8 all synthetic word-forms of the input lexeme (orof the l~t  lexeme processed while obtaining a pc-riphra~tic word-combina.tion).
It n\],o offers s. set ofmenus alIowing the user to modify his initial qlmryby choosing additions\] morphologicM categorh~s from~;lLese It\] (2~rtll S.In the TASK mode~ the input d~t~ is i~ sequence.of queries fed from the special TASK file.
Apartfrom lexical, morphological, and syntacticM inform~tlon contained in eaclt query, the TASK mode of op-ertLtion m~kes considerable use of word order (l~t~which is essential, axnong other things, for process-ing prepositional, adjectival and noun phrases.
Theoutput is the sequence of word-forms manifesting thephrases or sentences specified by the input sequenceof queries.Both in the QUERY ttnd bt th.e TASK modes, theoutput is displayed on the screen and written slmul-taneously in the speci~ SOLVE file.
If required bythe user, it may Mso include the alterations rome inthe queries processed and the d~tubase informa~tionused in their processing.
Inasmuch as the simulatio~tby RUMORS of ttte linguistic processes involved intl.ussla~t synthesis is faithful enough, this ~uxillaryd~ttL could be valuable by itself (e.g., for learningor teaching Russian), ~ide from its significance fordebugging and controlling purposes.2 Synthesis functionsenvisaged by RUMORS2.1 Morphoh)g ica l  funct ionsThe morphologic~ functlolts of RUMORS cover HIaspects of Russia.n in~le:don, as well as some semr~n-ticMly bafic lcxico-morphologlcaJ relationships.
'\['he inlh:xiona\] funetions tLre initiated after theinput query ha~ ~dreaxty been subjected to syntacticaland lexieo-morphologlcal operations, which retry lltrvemodified its htitial form.
At this stage, ii: contMasnothing but the lexeme and the infiexiontd categoriesspecifying its desired word-form.
If some categoriesneeded for complete specifictrtion of this word-formare not explicltly stated in the query, they are set-tled by default.
E.g., a query containing nothing butthe lexeme of a verb is taken to describe the finite177form, indicutlve mood, present ense, active voice, 3dperson singular of this verb, so that the query, s~y,6pam~ produces the form 6epem.The inilexional model of Russian implemented byRUMORS is the one proposed and detailed by prof.A.A.Zaliznyak (1977).
Its important virtue is tttatthe generation procedures it envls~ges represent thoseto be expected of human speakers of Russian morefaithfully than any other known model, wtfile the req-uisite database information is very compact.Our verslo~t of ZaliznyaMs inflexionai model dif-fers from its description in (Zaliznyabq1977) in tworespects.
On the one haztd~ we have reduced thescope of the original Zalizny~k's model, implementingit only in so fax as written Russltrn is concerned.
Astr result, quite a number of the p~rticulars of Russianaccentuation registered in (Zallznyak,1977), nt~mely,all those that axe relev~t for oral speech only, havebeen ignored.On the other hand, we h~ve extended the model tocover analytical word-forms.
Moreover, we have in-troduced a new type of morphological functions, theperiphrastic functions allowing RUMORS to produceoutput that makes sense even if the required worfl-form is non-existent (e.g., due to the lexeme h~vinga defective paradigm or to the combination of cs.te-gorlea in the query being beyond the scope of Rus-slan infiexlonal morphology).
E.g., the future tenseist person singular of the verbnoge~um~ 'win'(which does not h~ve thls form) is p~r~phrasede.uo~y noge~urn~ '< I > ~hall be able to win'.The lexlco-morphological functions of RU-MORS axe limited so fax to conversion between lex-emes having essentially similak semantics, but differ-ins in their part-of-speech or (for verbs only) aspec-tuai characteristics.
'l'hus~ the aspectuM or part-of-speech markers in the following three queriespaaocrn.~arn~:coo,Snarn~:lIc~use the lexeme~ in these queries to be replaced,resp., by the required perfective verb, noun, a:nd ad-jective:paeemu.aarat,~l, ne~lue tu$o ecmubtl~I.The implementation f aspectuallexico-morphological re ations is based, principally,o~t their description in (Zalizny~k,1977).
For p~rt-of-speech relations, we have adopted, though in avery limited sense, the concept of lexical substitutions(Zholkovsldj,Mel'chuk, 1970).If the d~tabase contains no information ecessaryfor switcldng to a lexeme of the desired a~pect orpaxt of speech, RUMORS resorts to its periphrasticfunctions or else m~kes modifications i~t the query.E.g., the query'~U~OS~Ug : 1'aimed at forming the verb corresponding to the nounuunoouur 'bureaucrat', will be processed to producethe phrase:Deaaern ms, umo xapa~mepno DAx uu~oo~uEa'< He > is doing what is typical of a bureaucrat'.2.2 Syntact i ca l  funct ionsRUMORS has two m~jor types of syntactical fune-tlons: relational ttnd word-string sues.
There is alasa third group of prepositional\]unctions.Relat ional  functions may be called both in theQUERY and in the TASK mode of operation to mod-ify the input query with regard to the relational re}.erenees it may include.
There may be references todependency relations, where the node specified by thequery acts either as dependent (D-references) or asgovernor (G-references}, and to ~napttoric relations(F-references).
I)- and G-references may containembedded rehLtional references, o that in the gen-era\] case each reference present in the input querycorresponds to tL more or leas corrtplex fragment ofthe dependency and anaphoric structure this queryis p~rrt of.The job of the rel~tlonal functions is to ensurefulfilment of the requirements for syntectical govern-ment and ~greement which may be imposed on theword-form specified by the query by the dependencyand anaphorlc relations this query has refereuces to.Tkls involves extr0cting such requirements from thereferences in the query, reconciling them with enc.hother (if there axe two or more references dictatingconflicting requlrements)~ a.nd then rnodifylng the inl-tim query to fit them: choosirtg the correct prepoul-tion or conjunction (tire empty one, if needs be) toaccompany the goal word-form, ~Itd ulteringj a~ re-quired, the inflexional and paxt-obspeech ategorieswithin the query.
E.g., the querypemenue R D~(aat~ucem~)describing the noun petueuue 'decision~an the synt~tc-tical object of the verb oasueem~ 'depend' will pro-duce the prepo~itlonai combination:om pemenu~r '< depend > on < the > decision'.Word-str lng fimctlons axe specific to the TASKmode of operation only.
Their peculiarity is that theyinclude some t~nalysis-llke operations maldng it pos-sible to locate s.nd process imple prepositional, ad-jectival and noun phrazes, even if the input sequenceof queries h~ no syntactical marking.To be more partlcul~r, word-strlng processing con-sists in ext~mining the queries of the input sequenceone by one until the query under examlutLtlon isfound to answer our definition of the end of aword-string.
During this ex~min~tlon, e~ch query ischecked for information relevant o agreement tLndprel)ozitionaJ gow~rnmenl;, ~J,nd tile inflexion~l ;J,ad178paxt-of-speech ~tegorles pertaining to such inform,>tion axe integrated into a special word-strir~g query(w-query).
After the end of the word-string bus beenlocated and exarnhted, the w-query obta.hted is, i~tstaatdaxd ca~es~ rome common to all of the individualqueries within this word-string.
'rhus~ the sequenceof morphologica l ly  empty  querle, for lexemeso, oec b ~atu, aa.~a~amura 'in, all, our, galaxy'will be processed to pro&me the prepodtionM phrase:so 8ee~ uataeCl eaaa~mu~e'in the whole of our #alaxy'.Some types of word-strlngs, e.g.
tho~e containing ct~r-dinM numerals, have to be subjected to more elabo-rate operations.If ?
query with la a word-string contains rela.tlonalreferences, the requirements imposed by these aregiven priority over the requirements extr~ted byword-string functions~ so that the l~tter provide asort of default.Prepos i t ional  funct ions s.re employed in bothmodes of operation, if the word-form or word-stringbeing processed is to be preceded by a preposition.Tltus~ if ttte preposition i~t question denote~ location,direction or source, the noun it i~ meant to accom-panty is checked for having lexical preferences in thi~respect.
This helps to account, e,g., for such idiomrtt-iCfl a.flaa yam~e 'in the ~treet'VS.n nepeyaue 'in the aide-,~treet'.Other prepositional fa~tctio,ts serve to ~dd theprothetie u to personal pronouns ~.fter prepositionsimposhtg this requirement, o choose the eoutextualform of the prepositlon if it ha~ more tht~n one oftheft h etc.The data.base ha~ thus been reduced to leas thanone fifth of (ZMiznya.k,1977), still Mt'ordiIIg correctmorphologica.l proees,~ing of M1 of the 100 000 lexemeslisted in (7,ali'anyak,1977).Moreover, so far ~m lexeme8 with st~n(hLrd morpho-\]ogle'el ch~razterlstlcs go, they ctLn now be processedcorrectly, even if they axe newly-colned or occasional(and do not htwe therefore dictionaxy entries of theirown).
As (ZMizny~k,1977) m~y be trusted to eontMnM1 non-standard lexemes, the inllexionM ~nd aspec-tu~l information i  the resulting d~t,~b~e v ry nearlycovers the whole of the ltussb~rt voct~bulaxy.The sltu~Mon is different with inform~tlon to beused in p~rt-of-speec.h conversion ~nd syntactic pro-c(;~dng, for it i~ not provided in (Zslie, ny~k,1977).This information is now also being Mded~ but in thisrespect, the datn.ba*m is fa,r from completed ~tnd ha~yet only experimental vMue.References\[1\] L.S,Modina, L.S., Shaly~qfin% Z.M.
