We have created a dictio-nary of syllabified words and analyzed afew general quantitative and phonologicalaspects of the dictionary.
Furthermore,we have approached the syllabic complex-ities, the sonority patterns present in thesyllable?s constituents and the degree inwhich the Sonority Sequencing Principle(SSP) holds for this language.
Based onall the information gathered we have de-vised an automatic syllabification algo-rithm which has a 99% accuracy on thewords in the dictionary.
In this way wehope to extend the existing phonologicalstudies on Eastern Romance and to spreadand preserve meta-linguistic informationon this endangered language.1 IntroductionAromanian, according to linguists (Papahagi,1974) or (Saramandu, 1984) is part of a largerfamily of Eastern Romance languages consistingfrom Daco-Romanian (standard Romanian), Aro-manian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian.We underline this characteristic because some ofthe linguistic properties that are present in Aroma-nian are also present, more or less, in the otherthree languages largely due to the common histor-ical and linguistic context in which they formedand evolved.
Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian andMegleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCORed Book (2010) as ?severely endangered?
lan-guages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002)and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002).Aromanian is not in a better situation carryingthe label of ?definitely endangered?
with approx-imately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002).
Cur-rently, the language has no accepted standard, be-ing written in various forms depending on socialand political factors of the regions in which it isspoken (Kahl, 2006).
This is why we believe thata study on Aromanian can only be done empiri-cally, on corpus data or dictionaries or by adoptinga multi-valued dialectal approach justified by fieldwork.2 Previous workAlthough Capidan (1932) offers an exhaustivestudy on Aromanian with valuable comments onprevious research, very few modern linguisticstudies target this language and there are no com-putational linguistic studies as far as we are awareat this point.
Caragiu-Mariot?ean (1968) offeredone of the first modern studies with respect to thephonology and structural morphology of the lan-guage; her work represents our linguistic base-line.
Since Aromanian is spoken in various re-gions, there are expected geographical particular-ities.
Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1997) classifies theAromanian sub-dialects into two types: type F -the variants that resemble the Farsherot, predomi-nant in Albania and some parts of Greece and typeA - all the other variants.
She argues that type Fsub-dialects are spoken by smaller communitieswhich have been influenced by type A.
Type F sub-dialects have certain phonetic features: the closed-central vowel [1] does not exist, the groups of con-sonants [rl], [rn] are transformed into a sound thatcould be classified as a velar [r] (Capidan, 1932)and the diphthongs [e?a] and [o?a] are transformedinto [e] and [o].110Place?

Ourdictionary uses the same alphabet to store the syllabified words.3 Dictionary of syllablesThe dictionary used in our study is compiledby Cunia (2010) from the dictionaries of Papa-hagi (1974) and the one of Dalametra (1906).
Themain advantage of this resource is its lexical rich-ness, including specific variants of words knownby the author.
Moreover, for most of the words,the syllabification is reproduced from a differentdictionary compiled by Papahagi (1974).
The lateris considered a valuable and reliable linguistic re-source for this language.
The final size of thedictionary has approximately 69.000 syllabifiedwords.
Among the disadvantages, we could counta significant amount of misspelled words (that wehave manually corrected), and words syllabifiedincorrectly.
Also, the dictionary is written with theorthography proposed by Cunia (1997) using analphabet that has only one diacritic.
The purposeof the alphabet is to be more practical in the digi-tal era, departing from other related phonemicallyspelled languages like Italian or Spanish.
One ofthe main drawbacks of this alphabet is the com-pression of two different sounds (the mid-centralvowel [@] and the closed-central vowel [1]) intothe letter ?
?a?, leaving the reader to decide whichphoneme is actually used.
The motivation behindthe compression comes from the two vowels beinggeographical allophones for Aromanian (depend-ing on type F or type A sub-dialect).
In this casewe should be cautious when analyzing vowels asphonological units.
This is not the only case whereorthography can influence our study.Aromanian, together with Romanian (Chi-toran, 2001), contrasts diphthongs [e?a], [o?a] fromsemivowel (glide) to vowel sequences [ja] and[wa] (written here as [i?a] and [u?a]).
This meansthat the phonological representation of diphthongsis the one proposed by Chitoran (2002): both ele-ments of the diphthong are represented as sharinga syllable nucleus.
According to this representa-tion, diphthongs are predicted to function as a sin-gle unit and a single segment.The orthography of our dictionary restricts usto partially operate with these distinctions.
Simi-lar to Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), the glide-vowelsequence [u?a] is less frequent - in our dictionarywith less than 100 occurrences - compared to thelarger number of occurrences for the diphthong[o?a].
However, other dictionaries like the oneof Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1997), which is completeonly to the letter ?D?, uses a different orthographyand the actual contrasts might differ from resourceto resource.
Since this doesn?t guarantee consis-tent results we represent internally all the abovepairs as single units in the nucleus.In the current state, the exact phonetic value ofthe letter ??a?
is ambiguous and the disambiguationis a non-trivial task unless parallel resources areavailable.To overcome the difficulty of using a specificalphabet, we have decided to convert the entire setof consonants from Latin script into IPA (Interna-tional Phonetic Alphabet).
The consonant inven-tory of Aromanian is detailed in Table 1, the samealphabet is used internally to store the syllabifiedwords.
Our representation does not have the sameamount of detail as a phonetic transcription would,instead, it offers a general unified format whichcould be used by linguists in future studies.
Ourdictionary also contains the accented vowels and adistinction between [u, e, o, i] and the semivowels[u?, e?, o?, i?
].The palatalized pairs of consonants [c]?[?]
and[?]?
[J] are to be found only before [i, i?, e, e?]
ac-cording to Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1968).
In all theother places the velar ones will be encountered.In practice, native speakers do not always use the111palatalized before [i, i?, e, e?]
but we will keep thisrule to be consistent across the dictionary.Romanian AromanianCV structures Percentage CV structures Percentagecv 55.04% cv 24.84%cvc 15.06% cvc 6.28%v 6.91% cvcv 5.07%ccv 5.82% cvv 2.76%cvv 5.43% ccv 2.54%vc 3.40% v 2.36%cvcv 2.86% vc 1.47%ccvc 1.33% ccvc 1.29%vv 0.83% cvvcv 0.91%cvcc 0.73% cvvc 0.37%cvvc 0.43% cccv 0.36%ccvv 0.24% vv 0.26%cvccv 0.23% ccvcv 0.25%vcv 0.23% vcv 0.22%cvvv 0.22% ccvv 0.20%cccv 0.22% cvcvv 0.13%vvc 0.16% cvvv 0.12%ccvcc 0.12% cccvc 0.12%cvvcv 0.11% vvcv 0.09%cccvc 0.11% vvc 0.09%Table 2: The first most common CV structures inRomanian and Aromanian.
Semivowels are alsodenoted with ?v?.
The syllables in both languagesallow complex CV structures.
Both languagesshare similar structures the difference is made inthe distribution of each.
The most frequent struc-ture is, in both cases, ?cv?
(consonant vowel).4 Syllabic structures4.1 CV structuresBoth Aromanian and Romanian share a large de-gree of common features, but no comparative stud-ies have been made on the CV (here: consonant-vowel) structures available in the two languages.For Romanian, a database of syllables was alreadyprovided by (Barbu, 2008) under the title ?RoSyl-labiDict?.
This database contains almost all themorphological forms of Romanian words.
Amongthe existing studies with respect to the CV struc-tures in Romanian we count the one of Dinu andDinu (2006).
Comparing two grammatically sim-ilar languages in terms of the distribution of CVunits can bring a new perspective on the simi-larities at the phonological level.
In CV-theory(Clements and Keyser, 1983) a syllable ?
is rep-resented in a three-tier form.For example the word ?rat?
:?ctvacrThe CV structures are a part of the phonologicallayer in the universal grammar and the most com-mon one, encountered in all the natural languagesis the ?cv?
structure .
In Table 2, both Romanianand Aromanian have this structure as the most fre-quent one.
Theoretically, the four primary types ofCV-structures are ?cv?, ?v?, ?cvc?
and ?vc?.
TheCV-theory (Clements and Keyser, 1983) predictsthat if a language has ?vc?
syllables then all theother three primary structures will be encounteredin that language.In Table 2, it?s not unusual to see CV structuresof the form [ccvcv], this is because the standardRomanian orthography, as opposed to English inmost of the cases, makes no distinction betweenthe grapheme of a semivowel and the one of avowel.
If the CV structure has the following form[ccvcv] then the second ?v?
is a glide.
In our inter-nal representation of our dictionary two glides canbe encountered at the end of syllables: [i?]
the markfor plural in all the Romanian dialects and [u?]
- fre-quently emphasized in the texts since the first Aro-manian writers of the eighteen century (Papahagi,1909).4.2 Menzerath-Altmann lawMenzerath-Altmann law (Altman, 1980) statesthat the size of a linguistic construct is inverselycorrelated with the size of its constituents.
Whichmeans, in this particular case, that the averagesize of a word in syllables increases as the aver-age size of the syllable (in phonemes) decreases.Previous studies proved that this law has appli-cability for more general linguistic constructs, insyntax (Buk, 2007) and even beyond linguistics ingenome structures (Baixeries et al., 2013).
In thesyllable-phoneme context, extensive studies havebeen made.
Fenk et al.
(2006) investigated thislaw on 33 different languages and found an ac-tive correlation between the CV complexity of thesyllables and the decay of the ratio between num-ber of syllable and number of phonemes per syl-lable.
In this sense, we have investigated the re-lation between Romanian and Aromanian with re-112Figure 1: Menzerath-Altmann law.
The word/syllable ratio in Romanian and Aromanianspect to the Menzerath-Altmann law.
We used the?RoSyllabiDict?
dictionary of Romanian syllablescompiled by Barbu (2008).
This dictionary is con-structed from almost all the morphological word-forms in Romanian, having a considerable size ofabout 520.000 entries.The results can be visualized in Figure 1 - Ro-manian has a smaller average length of syllables,somewhere close to 4 but a significantly larger av-erage length of words - close to 11.
While Aroma-nian has a slightly larger length of syllables, closeto 4.5 but the length of the words does not exceed7 syllables in average.
Moreover, Romanian is ahighly developed language containing a vast setof neologisms and loans that can affect the wordlength.
While Aromanian is more an archaic lan-guage spoken in small communities usually usedbetween family members lacking the lexical rich-ness of a general-use language.
On one hand,Aromanian has a smaller average length of wordsthan its developed relative, on the other hand, atthe phonological level, even though the decay issimilar (overlapping most of the times), Aroma-nian presents a slightly larger length of syllables(in phonemes).
This suggests that Aromanian isslightly more complex in terms of syllable phono-tactics than Romanian.4.3 The structure of the syllableIn order to investigate the complexity and diversityof the syllables in Aromanian, we have chosen toexamine the constituents of the syllables in termsof sonority sequences.
Phonetically, the spokenchain consists in waves of sonority or sound in-tensity (Lehmann, 2005).
The Sequence SonorityPrinciple (SSP) (Clements, 1990) regards the syl-lable as the phonological unit behind the waves ofsonority.
A representation of this concept can bevisualized in Figure 2.Figure 2: The sonority waveThe sonority of a phoneme can be regardedas ?its loudness relative to that of other soundswith the same length, stress, and pitch?
(Lade-foged, 1975).
The sonority is given by a con-cept called strength (Escure, 1977), on one sidestrength can be represented by the sonorance inwhich the phonemes are ordered by their acousticenergy: Stops?
Fricatives?
Nasals?
Liquids?
Glides?
Vowels.
On the other side, the scalecan be represented by the articulatory resistance(Anderson and Ewen, 1987) of the phonemes asin Figure 3.Figure 3: Scale of articulatory resistanceThe Sonority Sequence Principle states that thesyllable?s peak is a group of segments of high113sonority while the syllable?s boundaries consistsof phonemes of low sonority.
In almost every nat-ural language there are exceptions to this princi-ple and investigating it can be valuable in speechrecognition and in automatic syllabification basedon phonotactic rules (Frampton, 2011).
If the ex-ceptions are accounted then the number of sonor-ity peaks in a word is correlated with the numberof syllables.
In the same manner, the number ofsyllable boundaries is correlated with the numberof low sonority phonemes.As previously mentioned, the ?cv?
structure isuniversal in every language, thus the syllable mayhave two basic constituents (Fudge 1969, 1987):an onset (governed by the consonant) and a rhyme(governed by the vowel).
The rhyme is further di-vided into a nucleus (forming the syllable?s sonor-ity peak) and a coda (consonants of descendingsonority), the following schema exemplifying theword ?tram?
is relevant to the definition:?RhymeCodamNucleusaOnsetrtA constituent (onset, nucleus, coda) is branch-ing if multiple phonemes are to be found in itsstructure and non branching if it is constructedfrom a single unit.
Onsets and codas in Aroma-nian can be empty (syllable made of nucleus only -?v?
), branching (two or more consonants ?ccv?
foronsets and ?vcc?
rarely for coda) or non-branching(?cvc?
- the most frequent construct, single conso-nant only).
In Table 2 the CV structures alreadysuggested this fact.
Compared to codas, the on-sets in these languages tend to be more complexbranching in up to three consonants.4.4 Sonority and the codaThe first observation arises with respect to theAromanian coda and the fact that it can end inglides [i?]
and [u?].
This creates a peak of sonor-ity inside the structure of the coda, thus a sonorityreversal right at the end of the syllable.
In this sit-uation the SSP is broken since the sonority is notdecreasing towards the end boundary of the syl-lable.
These types of codas appear in final syl-lables, the semivowel [i?]
being morphologicallydetermined while the semivowel [u?]
is a partic-ular feature of Aromanian.
Table 3 contains thepercentages regarding the sonority of the codas.Because of the final glides, a large number of co-das (41%) will break the SSP by having a sonor-ity reversal (a sequence of phonemes in ascend-ing sonority inside the coda).
Mixed codas havea sequence of phonemes that is neither ascendingneither descending.Coda sonority PercentageAscending 41.21%Descending 58.72%Mixed 0.06%Table 3: Percentages of the syllable coda.
The ma-jority labeled with ?Ascending?
are sonority rever-sals constructed from Cons + Glide.Given that the presence of these glides in word-final syllables is frequent in all the Romanian di-alects, we decided to adopt the following structureof the coda for word-final syllables:CodaGlidei?or u?ConsCCUsing this design we have also investigated thesonority of the coda in its ?Cons?
structure whichis limited in Aromanian to not having more thantwo consonants.It was noticeable to observed that the SSP isalways obeyed by the ?Cons?
substructure of thecoda.4.5 Sonority and the onsetAll the results so far, indicate that the coda isnot a very complex structure in this language.
Infact, Caragiu-Mariot?eanu (1968) stated that Aro-manian previously had open syllables.
A fact at-tested in the early works of the eighteenth centurywriters (Papahagi, 1909) describing the syllablesas being opened.
The linguistic study of Davisand Baertsch (2011) offers a model in which thestructure of the onset is related to that of the codathrough a shared component called margin.
Themodel predicts that a complex onset in a language114requires the presence of a coda (Kaye and Lowen-stamm, 1981).
For Aromanian, in particular, theformation of the coda could be a result of the in-creased complexity of the onsets.We have investigated the different patterns ofsonorities found in onsets, Table 4 contains thepercentages of each of these patterns.
Aromanianhas four types of sonority sequences in the onset:?
?Constant?
??
- one or more consonants(sonority plateau) with equal sonorities?
?Ascending?
?
- a sequence of phonemeswith ascending sonorities?
?Descending?
?
- a sequence of phonemeswith descending sonorities?
?Nadir?
??
- a sequence in which thesonority descends and then rises towardsthe nucleus (e.g.
the onset ?mbr?
or otherNasal+Stop+Liquid)Onset sonority PercentageConstant 89.10%Ascending 5.63%Descending 4.11%Nadir 1.13%Table 4: Sonority patterns found in syllable onsets.The ?Constant?
and ?Ascending?
sequences ofsonorities in onsets obviously obey the SSP andthey count as the majority in the language.
The as-cending onsets can take the following forms: [bl],[br], [dr], [Dr], [fl], [fL], [fr], [gl], [gL], [gn],[gr], [Gl], [Gn], [Gr], [kl], [kL], [kr], [ks], [kS],[p?
], [pl], [pL], [pr], [ps], [sl], [sm], [tl], [tr],[tsr], [vl], [vr], [xl], [xL], [xr], [zl], [zm], [zn],[zn], [Tr] from which the onsets ending in nasalconsonants (i.e.
[n], [m] or [?])
are found only inword initial syllables.About 5% of the onsets can be classified as ex-ceptions from the SSP and the majority of themare to be found in word-initial syllables.
In word-medial syllables we could count only rare exam-ples of fricative + stop clusters.
The descendingconsonant clusters in the onsets can be constructedby the patterns in Table 5.The most interesting phonotactic constraint tomention is related to ?Nadir?
onsets - all of themappear only in word initial syllables.
Intuitively,we may consider these onsets as being constructed[f] ?
[v] + [t] ?
[d?z][m] + bilabial, fricative[n] + most of the less sonorous consonants[s] ?
[z] + [p] ?
[b], [t] ?
[d], [k] ?
[g], [t?S] ?
[?
][S] + [k], [p], [t], [t?s]Table 5: Descending consonant clusters in the on-set.
The marker ?
underlines the voiceless/voicedfeature of the sounds.
The phonemes tend to clus-ter together depending on the voice (e.g.
[z] beinga voiced consonant is more likely to be encoun-tered near other voiced consonants - [b], [d], [g] or[?
]).from two types of clusters: on one hand ?Descend-ing?
+ ?Constant?
onset clusters and on the otherhand ?Constant?
+ ?Ascending?
onset clusters.Quantitatively, the two approaches are equiva-lent and have the following form:1.
?Descending?
onset cluster + liquid ([l], [L]or [r])2.
[m], [n], [s], [S], [z] + ?Ascending?
onsetclusterFrom a linguistic perspective the onsets that donot respect the SSP can be analyzed using the con-cept of semysillable.
Cho and King (2008) pro-posed this model of a syllable by imposing certainrestrictions:?
no nucleus?
no codas?
no stress/accent/tone?
prosodically invisible?
well-formed onset clusters (observing SSP)?
restricted to morpheme peripheral positionsThe concept has been applied on Georgian, Polishand Bella Coola - languages with highly complexclusters of consonants (Cho and King, 2008) andeven on French (F?ery, 2003) to split complex co-das.
In Aromanian, for both ?Nadir?
and the ?De-scending?
sequences, the semisyllable are word-initial.
These semisyllables contain only the onsetfrom one of the following phonemes: f, v, m, n, s,S or z.1155 Phonetic syllabification algorithmStudying the phonotactics of a language can bevaluable for rule based automatic syllabification(Clements, 1990).
Previous studies on phonolog-ically complex languages like Imdlawn TashlhiytBerber (Frampton, 2011) validated the universal-ity of this approach.
The work of Iacoponi andSavy (2011) addresses the same problem on Ital-ian, their rule-based phonetic algorithm reachinga precision of over 98%.
Not any phonetic al-gorithm can be generalized or applied to differentlanguages but in all the cases the same pattern ispreserved: the syllable boundary is defined by apoint of low sonority in a sequence of phonemes,see Figure 2.In our particular case, based on the previousanalysis of the sonority patterns, we have devisedthe following seven rules for establishing a sylla-ble boundary:1. diphthongs [e?a] and [o?a] are treated as singleunits (Chitoran, 2001)2. maximal onset principle: ?
|c+ ?
- if thephoneme c is a sonority minimum then thesyllable boundary is placed before the mini-mum and c is added to the next onset (Kahn,1976)3. word-medial c+nasal split: ?
+c| ?
- if theconsonant c is a sonority minimum and it isfollowed by a nasal consonant (i.e.
[n], [m]or [?])
then the syllable boundary is placedafter the minimum and c is added to the cur-rent syllable?s coda - based on the results inSection 4.54. special [s] + stop cluster - the fricative con-sonant [s] will be treated as having the samesonority as any other stop consonants ([p], [b]etc.)5.
split plateau: ??
| ??
- if a sonority plateauis found then put a syllable boundary in be-tween6.
initial semisyllables consisting from conso-nants will be glued to the immediately nextsyllable7.
word-final coda can end in one or two glides- as described in Section 4.4The second and the third rules are the ones re-ferring to the actual minimum points of sonoritywithin a word.
The key is whether we want to cutthe syllable before or after the minimum point andthis fact is determined by phonotactic constraints.The initial semisyllables, although they respect theSSP, are merged within the next syllable and theword final codas may end in glides.We have compared the output of this algo-rithm with the actual data already in our dictio-nary.
Almost one percent of the words were in-correctly syllabified because they were exceptionsto the above rules and the overall precision was99%.
This algorithm can easily be extended toother Eastern Romance languages by verifying theseven rules provided.6 Conclusions and future workIn this paper we have offered a quantitative ap-proach to the syllable structures and substructuresfound in Aromanian.
In addition, we propose adictionary resource to inspire future studies and tohelp preserve a ?definitely endangered?
Romancelanguage.
It is not an easy task to execute a studyon a language that lacks an institutionalized stan-dard.
Our approach is empirical, corpus based andthe quality of the results is strictly dependent onthe quality of the corpus.
This is why we have fo-cused on investigating general phonological prop-erties of the language in the limits afforded by thecorpus at our disposal.
Comparisons with existingstudies on Romanian reaffirm the tight relation be-tween the two languages and offer confidence thatthe results obtained are in accordance with exist-ing facts about them.
Moreover, based on phono-tactic investigations, we have constructed an algo-rithm for automatic syllabification in Aromanianthat has a 99% accuracy.Future studies involve developing this resourceto disambiguate the letter ??a?
and adding more de-tail in the phonetic representation by recording na-tive speakers.
The current phonological study willhelp us to further develop rule-based resources onmorphology considering existing theoretical stud-ies (Caragiu-Mariot?eanu, 1968) and may help usto better understand the evolution of the East-ern Romance languages and the relations betweenthem.
Last but not least, we hope that developingthese linguistic and computational resources willencourage a widespread use of Aromanian.116ReferencesAltmann, G. 1980 Prolegomena to Menzerath?s lawIn Glottometrika 2, pp.
