SummaryA formal grammar accounting for a r t i s t i cab i l i t i es  of a folk story te l le r  is proposed.This grammar comprises the following components:I) a grammar defining the set of formulae re-presenting steps of text  generation; 2) a l i s tof "messages" underlying the texts of a fo lk -lore genre; 3) a l i s t  of "rules of embellish-ment" serving to attach ar t i s t i c  qual i t ies  to"messages" and intermediary steps of textgeneration.I .
IntroductionThe best way for a researcher to presenthis knowledge of fo lk lore  is to demonstratethe ab i l i ty  to construct at least rough approx-imations of folk stor ies.
This should be donewith al l  the techniques accessible to immediateobservation and checking up.
We take thestandpoint that at the deepest level of a textl i e  thematic elements which const itute the"message" of the text .
"Rules of Embellish-ment" are applied to these elements and attachar t i s t i c  qua l i t ies  to them.
The analysis ofa text  is to be represented as a process ofgenerating i t  by "Rules of Embellishment.
"These Rules are analogous to transformationsin l ingu is t i cs .
They are "message-preserving"devices serving to increase the expressivepower of themes.Every rule of embellishment is a part i -cular instance of some "pr inc ip le  of expres-siveness," from the set of such "pr inc ip les"proposed by ?u.

There follows thel i s t  of the pr inciples of expressiveness.Embodiment (EMBOD) - a subst i tut ion ofsome more concrete and "v iv id"  element X 1 for  amore abstract element X.
The element X 1 hasal l  the properties of X plus some newfeature(s).Examples: a man ?
a carpenter; a c i ty  ?New York; a nose ?
a very big nose.Amplif ication (AMPLIF) - a subst itut ionof an "amplif ied" element X!
for a more"neutral" element X.
The ampli f icat ion may bewith respect to dimensions, duration, degree,etc.Examples: deception ?
treachery; rape ?chi ld-rape; ta lent  ?
genius.Repetition (REPET) - a subst itut ion of aseries of nearly identical elements X, X 1 .

.Detai l izat ion (DET) - a subst i tut ion of adetai led description Y1 of a thing, s i tuat ionor action Y, for Y.Examples: X is i l l  ?
X stays in bed andX has no appetite and X has a high tempera-ture; an old Jew dies ?
an old Jew i sn ' t  wel l ,other Jews come, they pray together, the Rabbicomes to v i s i t  the old Jew, the old Jew is deadand the body is carried to the cemetery.Compare an EMBOD of 'X is i l l '  ?
'X haspneumonia'Contrast (CONTR) - a subst i tut ion of twocontrasting elements X and Anti-X for  anelement ?.Examples: death ?
perfect health, death;treachery ?
loyal ty ,  treachery.Exposition (EXPO) - a subst itut ion of twoelements pre-X and X for X, where pre-X pre-cedes X in the text ;  pre-X may be:a) incomplete X (the shadow of X appears andthen X i t se l f ) ;b) the fe l t  absence of X (everybody is waitingfor X, then X appears);c) Anti-X followed by X.
The only differencebetween this case and CONTR is the order ofAnti-X and X.Adjustment (ADJ) - of X to Y with respectto a feature f:  X 1 is substituted for X, whereX 1 has al l  the essential properties of X, plussome feature f of an element Y occurring in thederivation of a text .Examples: touch (X), love (Y); Xl =embrace; house (X), many people meet (y);X 1 = club.Amalgamation (AMALG) - of X with Y - asubst i tut ion of an element Z for X and Y whereZ is the result  of EMBODs applied both to X andY.Examples: death (X), love (?
); Z = roman-t i c  suicide; presence (X), absence (Y), Z =a person in disguise.Reduction (RED) - a subst itut ion of X 1 forX, where X 1 is such a part of X that al l  thethematically important information contained159in X can be restored by means of X I .Examples: M. Dayan ?
one-eyed Israel iMinister;  murder + a blood-stained knife;Jewish re l ig ion ?
a Torah scro l l ;  communism ?The Red Banner.
Compare EMBOD: Jewish re l ig ion?
orthodox Jewish re l ig ion;  communism ?
Chinesecommunism.I t  seems to us that the most importantinnovations of ShcheglovandZholkovsky are ADJand AMALG.
The hypothesis that these pr inc i -ples are employed in the construction ofl i te rary  texts means the presence of intensivel inks between text  elements.
Let us give asimple example of the in tens i f i cat ion  of suchl inks.
Consider a "theme"I .
A person X uses an object Y to in jurea person g who uses an object d for aggressivepurposes.
We shall establish l inks betweensome elements of this text.
F i rst ,  we shalldeclare Y and d to be the same object:2.
A person X uses an object s to injurea person g who injures others with this veryobject s. Now we shall establish a l ink be-tween g and s. Let 's make s a sort of RED(g):3.
A person X uses an object s, which isused for aggression by g and is inherentlytypical of g, to in jure g. This quasi-texthas obvious a r t i s t i c  qua l i t ies  and may beinterpreted, for example, as:4.
The hero causes the s i tuat ion wherethe Dragon bites i t se l f  with i ts  venomousteeth.
"k "kSome applications and specif icat ions of theabove ideas follow.We were looking for the answers toquestions l ike :  What are creative ab i l i t i es  offo lk lore  s tory - te l le rs?
What are poeticsystems of d i f fe rent  fo lk lore  genres?
As thef i r s t  object of our invest igation we havechosen sacred legends of Moroccan Jews.To make the "Principles of Expressiveness"technical ly workable, we represent steps oftext generations by formulae of a formallanguage devised especial ly for this purpose.So analyzing a given text (a legend) - re-wr i t ten in our formal language - means con-struct ion of a minimal sequence of formulaeof this language so that:I.
The last  formula is an approximationof a given text.2.
One or more formulae of the sequenceare themes ("messages").3.
Every formula Q4, which is not a"message", is obtainable with an appli-cation of a rule of embellishmentfrom one or more formulae Qj, j < i .This resembles a proof of a theorem, wherea "message" is a sort of axiom, Rules ofEmbellishment are rules of inference, and a textis a theorem to be proved.
By the set of pos-sible "messages" and Rules of Embellishment, theset of al l  possible texts ( i .e .
,  the genre ofMoroccan Jewish sacred legends) is given as theset of all  provable theorems of our calculus.2.
Well-Formed FormulaeWe present below a grammar of the context-free language defining the set of al l  wel l -formed sentences (formulae) used to representsteps in the generation of sacred legends.
Thewell-formedness is understood as a purely syn-tact ica l  feature,Rule I .<text>?#<t-section>(><t-section>)*#Here #~ a terminal boundary symbol, ~ means"then", "and af ter  that" ,  * is Kleene's staroperator; the parentheses are neither terminalnor nonterminal symbols, they only mean thatthe sequence ><t-section> is to be repeated asa whole, A t -sect ion represents an event.
Forexample we may obtain with the Rule I :#<t-section> > <t-section> > <t-section>#Rule 2.<t-section> ?
<sign>(<t-section>)Rule 3.<sign> ?
+ I -  I = I ~The sign + marks an event which is good for theJews; the sign - marks an event which is bad forthe Jews; the sign = marks an event which ispar t i cu la r ly  bad for  the Jews; an event withis neither bad nor good for the Jews, butimplies a hope or a poss ib i l i ty  for the good,Rule 4.<t-section> ?
(<t-section>(~<t-section>)*)Here the inner pair of parentheses is used as inRule I .
The siqn ~ is used to say that two ormore events are amalgamated:(a~b) is one eventwhich is an AMALG for two events a and b; ~Qb~c)means that three events, a,b, and c are amal-gamated into one, etc.
More about the amalga-mation of events w i l l  be said below.Rule 5.<t-section> ?
STAT(<t-section>)The operator STAT can make any event into a"stat ive"  event.
A stat ive event is,  in a way,timeless.
STAT makes a last ing s i tuat ion outof an event.
For example, STAT(x loses y) maymean "x has lost y" ,  or else "x would usuallylose y".An action in the scope of STAT loses inpart i ts  usual consequences (a crime againstthe Jews performed under STAT is not punished,for example).
Protagonists involved in actionsunder STAT may be more general than outside the160scope of STAT (Jewish community vs a Jew, forexample).
That is ,  a term in the scope of STATmay not undergo an EMBOD affect ing i t s  occur-ences in the rest of the formula.Rule 6.<t-section> + STEP(<t-section>)The operator STEP makes a part ia l  event from acomplete one.
For example, STEP(x comes) maybe understood as "x knocks at the door", orelse "x is seen through the window", etc.
Inthis case, STEP(STEP(x comes)) may be under-stood as "x is unclearly (or par t ia l l y )  seenthrough the window".Rule 7.<t-section> ?
QUASl(<t-section>)The operator QUASI is used to designate a sym-bol ic  or r i tua l  counterpart of an event.
Forexample, QUASl (The army occupies the c i ty)  maybe "The army leader receives the keys of thec i ty" .Rule 8.<t-section> ?
<adverb>(<t-section>)Rule 9.<adverb> ?
MIR I ANTI I NOTMIR means "miraculously";  ANTI means "oppositeto .
.
. "
;  NOT may be understood as negation.Rule I0.<t-section> ?
<predicate expression>(&<predi-cate expression>)A more complex event is represented as an un-ordered set of simpler events.Rule I I .<predicate expression> + <sign>(<predicateexpression>)Rule 12.<predicate expression> ?

PROSELYTIZED (x) meansthat x imposes on himself, par t ia l l y  or com-p lete ly ,  the laws of the Jewish re l ig ion ,GUILTY(x) is a state of x which is punishableby the author i t ies  for an offence against them.USE (x,y) is a typ ica l ,  normal re lat ion betweenhuman x and a thing y, y being conceived ex-c lus ive ly  as a means of x's wel l -being.
Theexact nature of th is  re lat ion depends on x andy.
For example, x beinq a community and ysa int 's  shrine, USE becomesvisit ingandpraylng,asking for help, being cured, etc.
INJURE(x,y)is x's doing any harm to y.
CAUSE (A,B) means:the event A happens and involves the event B.RESTORE (x,y) means l iqu idat ion  of the conse-quences of x's in jur ing y.
DISABLE and PETRIFYare two forms of paralysis ,  the f i r s t  one par-t ia l ,  the second one complete.
INATTACK (x,y)is involuntary in jur ing y by x.
CANCELED (A)means: a l l  the consequences of the event Abecome non-existent.
MAKESEE (x,y) means thatx causes the bl ind y to see.Rule 14.> <The symbol over a term may be rewrittenas ~ - ~,~_mean For a term x the ex-pressions T, respect iyely,  that theoccurrence of a predicate, with x, ~, x f i l l -ing up a s lo t ,  is bad for x, good for x, orinvolves a hope for the good for x.

Using theinformal semantics given above with the formalsyntactical rules of our language, we can read,for example, the second message approximatelyas follows:"A human Arab agent (HUMAN,A) injures a Jewishobject (J), which is bad for the Jews (theevent is marked by minus), and after that (>) aJewish bearer of Sacred Power (J*SP) miracu-lously (MIR) protects the (above) Jewish object,which is good for the Jews (marked by plus).
"The above messages can be developed intoseparate stories.
But a subset of them can bealso "amalgamated" to a single story by theappropriate rule of embellishment.4.
The "Rules of Embellishment.
"These rules are the central part of ourgrammar.
There are many of them; we cannotpresent here more than several typical examplestaken from our technical reports(see 2).The setof possible objects (protagonists and things)of the legends is described in 2 by a networkgrammar: a possible object is an unordered setof features picked up from the arcs of the net-work by moving from the in i t ia l  state to a finalstate.
Asterisks are inserted between thefeatures.
Examples: the term HUMAN,SINGLE,VERIMP,RELA*J*SP*MALE can be understood as "AJewish Saint"; the term THING*SINGLE*SYMBOL*A*GRAVE(HUMAN*SINGLE*VERIMP*RELA*A*MALE*KADI) canbe read as "the grave of an Arab Kadi.
"The same network serves to EMBOD terms: to anyset of features which belong to a path in thenetwork we may add any set of features whichbelong to the same path.
So, for example,HUMAN,GROUP ?
HUMAN,GROUP,A,SIMPLE,MALE("people" ?
"some Arabs")is a rule of embodiment for terms by virtue ofthe fact that there is a path in the network towhich both the left-hand set of features andthe right-hand set belonq (see the network in2 pp.
15-18; the report 2 is to be d i s t r i -buted among the participants of COLING-80).NB: Any rule of embodiment, when chosen,is to be applied to every occurrence of theexpression I for  exampie, the term) which is tobe substituted for.
There are complications,for example, with EMBOD of RESPECT, but we shallnot deal with them here.By a rule of such kind we can obtain, forexample, from the second message the followingformula:# -(INJURE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP,SlMPLE*J)) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP,SIMPLE*J)))#.The following rule is an example of EMBODfor predicate expressions:INJURE(HUMAN,A, HUM~)  ?
MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN,~, PROPERTY(HUMAN*J)).The appl icab i l i ty  of such rules is con-ceived so as to make possible the applicationof this rule to the above formula (cf.
2 ,  pp.29-32), with the following result :-162#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN a))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP,S IMPLE*J) ) ) #.The feature HUMAN (which is ,  in our grammar,predictable by the feature SIMPLE) can be in-troduced to the last term by obligatory ADJto SIMPLE*HUMAN,J (which is considered animmediate descendant of SIMPLE,J), with theresult:#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN,A,VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE,HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP,SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#.So the ident i ty  of the Jewish protagonist isrestored, Now we can amalgamate the aboveformula with the third message.
This is thesimplest case of AMALG: the two chains ofevents are mixed up to produce one chaincomprising al l  the events.
This is done undercontrol of the (thematic) principle prescribingthat al l  "minus-events" precede all  "plus-events":#-(INJURE(HUMAN*A,J)) ~ -(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR(REVENGE(J,SP, HUM~)) )  > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP,SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#.Now, we do not need two di f ferent v i l l a ins .One v i l l a in  wi l l  do: we can polish the formulaby ADJ of the term HUMAN,A to the term HUMAN,A,VERIMP.
This optional adjustment is a specificcase of EMBOD: an expression is EMBODed so asto become similar (in the l im i t  case-identical)to another expression of the operand formula.So we obtain:#-(INJURE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP,J)) ~ -(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))+(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP, HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) ~ +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#.The term J of the f i r s t  t-section canunderqo an analoqous operation, and now weshall have only one Jewish protagonist in thestory (a "SIMPLE" one):#-(INJURE(HUMAN,A,VERIMP, J,SIMPLE*HUMAN)) >-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN*A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE,HUMAN,J))) > +(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP,HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J,SP, SIMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#.Two di f ferent acts of '~njuring" can beamalgamated to one by the followin 9 rule: twodif ferent t-sections X and Y such that Y can beobtained from X by rules of EMBOD, can be amal-gamated by dropping X.
Now Y serves torepresent both X and i t se l f .
By applying thisrule to the above formula, we obtain:#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(HUMAN,A, VERIMP,PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) > +(MIR(REVENGE(J,SP,HUMAN*A*VERIMP))) > +(MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, SIMPLE,HUM~)))#.Now, one can amalgamate the SP's acts ofrevenge and protection, with the result:#-(MISAPPROPRIATE(TIUMAN,A*VERIMP, PROPERTY(SIMPLE*HUMAN*J))) ~ +(MIR(REVENGE(J*SP,HUMAN*A*VERIMP)) ~ MIR(PROTECT(J*SP, S'iMPLE*HUMAN*J)))#.This formula can be read as follows:"A human Arab agent belonging to the highestsocial stratum misappropriates a property of aJewish person of low status.
After that anevent occurs which is at the same time an actof Jewish Saint's revenge with respect to theArab, and an act of this Saint's protectionwith respect to the Jew.
"This story s t i l l  needs an interpretat ion,but we think that even at this stage the abovetext possesses some ar t i s t i c  potential accumu-lated in the process of i ts  derivation from thethemes (messages).
A rough interpretation ofthis text could run as follows:"The Sheik misappropriates a valuablething belonging to a Jewish shoemaker (orcarpet-maker), and the Rabbi causes this thingto return miraculously to i ts  legal possessorIn a way which damages the Sheik.
"A more delicate interpretation can giveus something l ike:  " .
.
.
the  misappropriatedcarpet (in the case of a carpet-maker, with anappropriate ADJ) miraculously returns to i tspossessor carrying the frightened Sheik on i t .
"Or else:" .
.
.
the misappropriatedpair of shoes (in thecase of a shoemaker, with an appropriate ADJ)miraculously returns to i t s  possessor carryingthe Sheik wearing them.
"Such interpretations are beyond thecapabi l i t ies of our grammar, but (we hope) notfar beyond the capabi l i t ies of grammars ofthe kind proposed.Interpretations for simpler cases ofAMALG for events are easily achievable techni-cal ly,  for example:(INJURE(A,J) ~ INJURE(HAWKER,SHEPHERD)) ?INJURE(A,HAWKER,J,SHEPHERD), etc.Amalgamated events are usually good for the Jews.Events which happen to be good for the Arabsare simple, t r i v ia l .
Let us take now one moreexample, rather typical for our material:.
.
.
~ +(INJURE(SP, SIMPLE*A)) > +(INJURE(SP,VERIMP*A)) > ..
.--163--Amalgamating injur ies with two di f ferentpersons injured is a typical a r t i s t i c  devicein Moroccan Jewish sacred legends.
At present,we only assume the "intention" of a story-te l le r  (or a story author) to amalgamatethe above events:.
.
.
~ +(INJURE(SP,SlMPLE,A) ~ INJURE(SP,VERIMP,A)) > .. .Now, how is this aim achieved?
TypicalJewish legend uses a technical i ty which maybe called Deposite.
Deposite is a thing ora person related to authorit ies but temporarilyunder the responsibi l i ty of a "simple" person.Injuring a deposite means injuring both the"simple" person and the "very important"person involved.
In the story analyzed in 2the deposite is the Sheik's son.
In anotherstory the role of a deposite is played by ag i f t  (of a group of "simple" Arabs to theSheik).The amalgamated character of SP actionsis so typical of our legends that i t  may beconceived as nearly thematical.
In general,an optional a r t i s t i c  device can move to thethematic sphere and become obligatory.
I t  isnearly so in the case under discussion wherethe amalgamation around an SP action ispreferable, though a concrete real ization ofthe operator~leaves considerable freedom toa s tory- te l ler .There follow more examples of rules ofembellishment.#s(a)>+ #s(STAT(s(a)))Here s is a sign.
This rule serves to turnthe opening event of a story to the exposition,a standing situation which is to become thebackground for the rest of events.>s(a)# ?~s(STAT(s (a ) ) )#This is an analogous rule for the transformationof the last event to the coda, the epilogue ofa story.There follow two rules for EMBOD of STEP:STEP(a) ?

.

.
or i=k)The last  rule is a way to EMBOD an EXPOfor a set of events: an event from the setoccurs.Now we shall present a rule of EXPO (whichexists in three di f ferent forms):>-(T) >4> - (TRY( - t - , - (T ) ) )>- (T )#-(T) >+# - (TRY( -{ - , - (T ) ) )>- (T )>+(T) >?> - (TRY( ' t - ,+(T)) )> ,(T)TAe above rule works for a t-section Twhere t appears in the f i r s t  place of the high-est predicate of T which does not appearimmediately after ANTI or NOT; otherwise Yshould appear in the f i r s t  place of the highestpredicate.Example: the expression.

.
~ ~(TRY(ROMAN~J,+(ANTI(DISTRESSED(HUM~)))))+(ANTI(DISTRESSED(FF~-)))> .
.
.An example of AMPLIF (or CONTR, or ratherAMPLIF by CONTR):-(PROHIBIT(A,+(P(t I)))) ~ + >-(PROHIBIT(A,+(P( t l ) ) ) )~ -(P(a))~Here P(t l )  is a predicate expression with aterm ~I in i ts  f i r s t  place (or the only place).The t-section P(A) is obtained by substitutingthe term corresponding to A (an a~ab_agent)for t I in P(t),  and changing any t i l t  I to t i .This is an AMPLIF for prohibit ion: an Arabagent not only prohibits t ' s  doing P, butdoes P himself (or herself).
Example:.
.
.
> -(PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP,+(USE(SIMPLE*J,J*SYMBOL))))~...+ ...>-(PROHIBIT(A*VERIMP,+(USE(SIMPLE*J,J*SYMBOL)))) > -(USE(A,VERIMP,J*SYMBOL))p .. ,The principle of CONTR is exemplified alsoby the following rule:s(TRY(-t-,T)) ?
s(TR?
(-t-,T)) > FAIL(t,T),where s is a sign, t is a term and T is a t-section.Many other rules of embellishment, amon~them some more sophisticated ones, see in 2Some transformations, which we call FormalEquivalences, do not contribute to expressive-ness, but serve only to improve readabil i ty ofa formula and to fac i l i ta te  implementation ofthe Rules of Embellishment.
There are ruleseliminating adverbial expressions:so(ANTI(si(ABASE(tl,t2)))) ?
So(PRAISE(tl,t2))or el seso(ANTl(sl(DISaBkE(tl,t2)))) + so(CURE(tl,t2));there are rules dealing with signs:NOT(-(T)) ?
+(NOT(-(T)))or el seSo(So(T) ) ?
So(T), and many others.Here s o and s I are signs, t I and t 2 are terms,and T is a t-section.5.

In thisgraveyard was buried a great and learned rabbi.The Arabs did not know of this, for in thevillage in which the graveyard was situatedthere were only Arabs, and no Jews at a l l .One night one of the women of the villagedreamed that a man dressed in a long whiteshirt and with a long white beard came toher.
He said to the woman: "In the morninginform the men of the burial society of theJews in the neighbouring town that theirrabbi, who is buried in the Moslem graveyardin the vil lage, has no peace.""
I r i s  just a dream," said the woman toherself.
But the dream was repeated.

Butwhen the dream was repeated for the third time,she knew that the dream spoke truly to her.On the following day she went to the town totel l  about her dream.Themen of the burial society came tothe sheik of Tthe village and said to him:"Our,~rabbi is buried in yQur graveyard.
Permitus to seek outthe place.
We shall pay youmuch money i f  you wil l  allow us to build overthe grave a place for prayer.

The sheik wil l  k i l l  us i f  ,-he hears that his son has become paralysed.
"""Break down the fence!"
the men of theburial society commanded.
And straight awaythe Arabs broke down the fence.Then they drew a circle about the spotwhere the sheik's son was standing,,tookstones and wrote upon i t  "A holy ~e~i,sh grave".Then the sheik's son began to move,~is limbsand move from the place.
"Where am I?"
heasked.
"What has happened to me?
"They told him everything and then he said:" I f  that is the case then your rabbi is indeedgreat.
"The Arabs erected a monument on the grave,and every year the Jews came there to celebratethe Rabbi's birthday.See Dov Noy 3 , pp.

This is not a simplerepetit ion which is characterist ic of fa i rytales ( " .

tr ied once and did not succeed,tr ied the second time and did not succeed,tr ied the th ird time and succeeded...").
Inour legend the fa i lure  is to be taken moreseriously: the Jews acknowledged the defeatand were ready to leave the graveyard.
Aprofessional story wr i ter  (for example, adetective story writer)  would not ignore sucha device: the detective t r ies  to find thedecisive evidence, admits his fa i lure  (forexample, cal ls  to the police off ice: "Nothingo f  interest!")
and then - by accident - findsthe desired object.
In our story, too, thediscovery is accidental.
I t  does not resultfrom any additional ef fort  by the Jews.
Morethan that, i t  is caused by a hosti le action.The punitive action by SP (the Sheik's sonbeing petr i f ied)  creates a knot of entangledevents; in fact, one event which comprisesdi f ferent actions.
The petr i f i cat ion is ,  atthe same time, the discovery of the holy graveby the Jews (no separate action of f inding isinvolved).
The petr i f i cat ion means that theJews have found the holy grave, Tt is a signof the holy grave being here.
More than that:the Sheik's son being pet~ied  means dangerfor the group of Arabs who are responsible forhis peaceful return home.
The Arab communityis punished by endangering a representativegroup of Arabs ( "o f f i c ia l s " ) .
The last compo-nent of the complex event under considerationis the Sheik's son's being turned to a sortof stone, a sort of statue.
The symbolicsignificance of this act was recognized notonly by us but also by some students, includingthose of Moroccan Jewish or ig in:  petr i fy ingthe Sheik's son is a symbolic counterpart oferecting a monument on the holy grave.
TheSheik's son is forced to erect a sort ofmonument with his own body.
Thus an actionwhich is to be performed by the Jewish com-munity is in fact performed (in symbolic form)by a hosti le agent.
This is a manifestationof a pr inciple which the whole story is per-meated with: plus-actions are regularly per-formed by the potential or actual enemy - theArabs.
The Rabbi appears in the dream to anArab woman.
I t  is up to her to inform theJewish community of the problem which has ar i -senl.
The symbolic monument is f i r s t  erectedwith the Sheik's son's body.
The Arabs them-selves destroy the wall around the cemetery,not just permitting the Jews to do so.
TheArabs encircle the holy grave, to designatei ts  exter r i to r ia l i ty  in the Arab graveyard.They then erect a temporary monument with somestones.
F inal ly ,  the Arabs build the propermonument.BibliographyI.
