In one major sect ion  we di scussthe imprecision, the incompleteness, the open-endedness, and theuncertainty of psopl,eqs knowledge.
In the other major sect ion  wediecuss strategies people use to make di f ferent  types of deductive,negative,  and functional inferences,  and the way uncertaint iescombine in  these in ferences .Irapreeision can occur either i n  memory or i n  camunicat ion.SCHOLAR can have precf ae values or fuzzy values stored, and itsprocedures can, to eome extent, deal with fuzzy questions whenprecise valtues are stored, and w i t h  precise queltions, when fuzzyvalues are stored.
Embedding allows i n f o  t i o n  to be specifiedi n  the data base to any level of d e t a i l  or preci sfon.
But SCHOLARonly camunicatea the nwst important i n f o  t i o n  on any topic (asrneasured by importmce tags) ,  unless more i n f o  t i o n  i s  requested.1.t should a l s o  be possible by using importance tags to adjust  what+jon SCHOLAR communicates, i n  accord with the sophisticationand, i n t e r e s t s  of the l i s t e n e r .Inference atrategiee tha t  are appropriate when the completeset of object attributes, or values, is  known (i .em, in a closedworld) do not apply when knowledge is incomplete e ,  i n anopen wrld)  .
There are a variety of u n c e r t ~ i n  i n f  ercnces  thatpeople use to circumvent the hales i n  their knowledge, which arebeing progr ed i n  SCHOLAR.There is a set o f  transitive relations -- superordinate,superpart, s lar i ty ,  pra imi ty  , subordinate, and subpart relations-- that people frequently use to make deductive inferences,Currently SCHO on ly  handles superordinate i n f e r e n c e s  (em g .
,the Llanos has a rainy season because it is a savanna) and super-part inferences (e .g, , the language in Rio is Portuguese becauseR i o  is part of Brazil).
~ e d u c t i v e  inferences can be more or l e a sc e r t a i n  (similarity inferences are l i k e  s u p t o r d i n a t e  inferences.but l e a s  certain) and can have restrictions on their use (onlycertain attributes transfer an superpart).~ b n  k owledge is incomplete, it is not safe t o  assume thatsomething is n o t  true just because it  i s  not s t o r e d .
Thus an in-ference is necessary to decide when to say ' N o w  and when to say'I donBt know,@ There is a eamp1Pcated s e t  sf strategies inSCHOLAR to find vatious kinds of contradictions that people caseto say *NO, " If a contradict ion cannot be found, another nega8iveinference, cal led  the Wlack-aF-knawledgea inference, f s tried*When enough is known a b u t  an abjech it is possible to concludethat someaing is not true ut mat object ow the  ground8 thatif it were true, it m u l d  be stared,another class of wcer ta in  inferences depends an i l l - d e f  inedknovledge of functional datenainants , e .g.

Because of these c o n d i t i o n s ,  peoples , eem to have an almost i n f i n i t e  i n f o  tion processing capaci ty,w i t h  i n f e r e n c e  making and problem solving abilities more r e f i n e dand far more f l e x i b l e  than any ex i s t ing  computer program.Now man we study a e s e  hman eapabiLities in order to makeour machines show similar perfbnnance?
A combination ofapproaches is perhaps best.
Observat ion of people ' s behavior,introspection, some experimentation, protocol analysf s, andsynthesis of computer programs can a l l  be vhluable t echn i l~ues .
A6 recent paper (CalZins, mrnock and Passafime ) discusses  a tech-nique for combining protocol analysis with program synthesis asapplied to tutorial  dialogues.
The synthesis directs what toanalyze, and the strategies observed in the analysis are evaluatedby synthesis, in a kind of feedback Poop We have been u s i n gthe SCHOLAR system in this way as a vehicle f o r  experimentationw i t h  natural semnties.Before we d i s c u s s  some of t h e  major problems in naturalsemantics, we w i l l  b r i e f l y  describe the SCHOLAR system, since iti e  t he  enviroment  f o r  our  research.
A word of caution though:we are only  t r y i n g  to develop some i n s i g h t s ,  without  attemptingto be exhaustive.

There are many observable things  people do that  we don o t  h o w  how to simulate,Semantics.-1x1 this section we w i l l  di scus s ,  very b r i e f l y ,  same p e r t i n e n taspects o f  SCBO a mixed-initiative i n s t r u c t i o n a l  system.

In tutorial fashion, t he  system uses its semanticnetwork to generate t he  material it presents, t h e  questions itasks, and the corrections it makes.
At any time SCHOLAR acceptsquestions and r ests f r o m  the s t u d e n t ,  and generates responsesbased on its semantic network, making calculat ions and f nferencesof different types t h a t  i t  has  been progaamed to handle.
Thedialogue is unanticipated, and i s  dependent on t h e  student'srsspanses, questions, and requests.

One of t h e  ways SCHO uses 1 -ags  is todecide what  +s relevant to say at any given ti-,In the rest of this paper, we will d i ~ c u s s  how we are usingSCHOLkR to cope: wi* gome of the problems in n a t u r a l  s e m a n t i c s .However, Lhero are still many nathral-aewantics problems we haveno t  touched,3 ,In this section we discuss some aspects of natural semantici n foma t ion  and its relation to artf Ficial intelligence.3 , fImprecise language is an essential characteristic of humanPOcomnrun&cation.
As Lyons says, *Far from being a defect a ssome philosophers have suggested, referential 'impreciseness' ...makes language a more efficient means of communication. "
Talkingut a tall person or a blue-green object does not requireprecise specif icat ion of he igh t  or spectral characteristics.
Theimprecision may occur either in communication or storage.
If wesay that a colleague receives a large salary, we may or may n o th o w  the f igu re .SCHOLAR c u r r e n t l y  stores areas and populations in nform, but it can respond to the fuzzy question "Is Montevideolarge?"
with a p e r t i n e n t  answer l i k e :  'It is n o t  one of thelargest cities in South America, but it is the largest c i t y  inUruguay, " Here SCWOLaR has found tm supeqarts ,  South merieaand Uruguay* and then campred M n t e v i d w  to other cities in eachw i t h  qespect to population.However, it is mrce co n fo r  people to @tore valuesthat are irarprecise or f l fuzzy' ,  what 2adeb19 calls 'linguistic'variables.
This is the case w i t h  values like large' ,  'red', 'ho-t' ,' r i c h g ,  etc.
It seems to us that one must be able  to storee i ther  precise values or fuzzy values interchangeably.
(In f a c t ,SCHO has fuzzy values as well as preoiae values atoted, e.g.
,t h a t  the Brazilian Highlands has a large population.)
Further-more, the procedures t h a t  a c t  upon therre values must be f lexibleenough to deal  with either.3 2Imprecise statements $re of t e n  motivated by incompletespecification.
S ince  a l l  specifications can be refined, theyare essentially incomplete.
We store what is necessary, and ifwe store more, we o n l y  comunieate what is pertinent.
SCHOLARdoes this through its I-tags.
If it is asked ' T e l l  me aboutPerm," it only gims a f e w  s a l i e n t  facts.F u r t h e r  spec i f ica t ion  can be added by r e f i n i n g  e x i s t i n gvalues.
l o r  axmple, i n s t ead  of 'blue we can have 'Navy bluev,OB.
'quite dark MaPry blue" ,tee.
Furbher specification can alsobe added by giving plow properties w i t h  a t t r ibu tes  somenhatortkogonal to previous ones.
An example of this is 'tall man'veraua 'tall, h e a v  m n  wearing glasses0.
Propert ies  can bespecified to any level of detail by embedding, an  i n h e r e n t  qual i tyof SCHO -type semantic networks.Somawhat related to incompleteness and relevancy is theeference problem (see Olsonl') Referring to a colleague, wenay 'define8 him as the father of Jack and Jill, or the author ofthat  paper on self-referential otatments ,  or tihe t a l l  t h i n  fell-ufth glasses.
We decide on some specification de.pending on the:ontext, including our assumptions about the person we are talkingto.
People usually specify o n l y  to the degree that is needed.In this sense, every partial specification is a ' d e f i n i t i o n ' .The problem of context pemades matualb senam8;%es.Def in i t ions  and specifications,  anaphoric references, what andh o w  to answer, a l l  depend on context.
Furthe re, there usuallyeo-exist a range of contexts from overall con tex t  to short- ternrunning contexts.
For example.
at a given time, SCHOLAR mayhave the contexts South America, Argentina and Buenos A i r e s r  eachw i t h  some dwamically adjustable If fe.
What is releva*.
at anygiven t h e  depends on this contextual hierarchy.A s tart  toward making references specific to the listeneris possible in a SCHOLAR-type system by using I-tags (see Collins,Warnock, and ~ a s s a f  iumeb) .
The likelihood t h a t  another pereonwill know about any concept ie raugkily pmwrtional to theimportance of the concept,  as measured by the 1-tags,  withrespect to the overall  context.
Therefore, it is possible tosstfmate .the sophist icat ion of a permn based on the level of tagsof the concepts he ment ions  in h i s  conversation.
This estimatethen can influence the descript ion one uses in referring to Someconcept.
For example, to an unsophisticated listener one mightrefer to the "capital of Argentina" rather t h a n  'Buenos Aires, abecause the I-tags fo r  the concepts *capitalw and "Argentinaw arelamr than *ose for  'Buenos AiresFw as  masured from a contextsuch a8 geographycIn t he  fugure  we want to have adjustable con t ex t s  in SCROLM,eo mat it can  t a l k  about ~e ARPA ne twork ,  say, "from a communi-cations p o i n t  of viewm to one person and *from a progr fng p o i n ta% viewm to another person.
What this e n t a i l s  is a temporarya l t e r a t ion  of t he  relat ive values of I-tags th roughout  t h es a a n t i c  n e b o r k ,  Thwe concepts t h a t  are referred to under  $Paeconcept wcommicationU (such as message capaci ty b i t - ra te ,  e e  .
)should be temporarily increased in importance wherever they occurd a b  base, fo r  the person interested in communication.
Acorresponding chmge must be made for  the person i n t e r e s t e d  ining OP any a a e r  concept or s e t  of concepts.
This kindof sensitivity to tihe interests and background of the person, andthe kind of s e n s i t i v i t y  (described above) to the saph i s t i ca t ionsf Ule person may be the two major alments  i n  the way peopleadapt what they say to t h e  listener,3.4In some realm o f  discourse such as an air l ine  resrsmatians17 15.ystam (Hoods ) , a blocks world (Winograd F, or a lunar rockscatalogue (Woods, Kaplan, and ~ a s h - ~ e ~ e r l ~ )  , there is a closedaet  of objects, attr ibutes ,  and rmluel~ to deal w i t h .
However,.ip most real world domains such as those faced by SIR ( ~ a ~ h a e l " ) ,2TLC (quillian'2) at SCHOLAR (Carbonell ) , there are open set8 ofobjects, attributes, and values.
It turns out tha t  the proceduresand even the rulae of inferdnce that can be applied are differenti n  closed and open worlds,The di s t inc t ion  between closed and open assts is one ofexhaustiveness and not one of s i z e ,  For ex le,, the set ofstates (e.g., Iowa) .
which is a cYbeed s e t  for most people, isprobably larger than the set of cattle breeds ( e a g e r  Aolatein),nfrich is an o set.
However, & p a  sets  t m d  to be lkrger  i n %general than closed sets.The di s t inc t ion  is important in a variety of ways.
Forexample, if there are no basaleic rocks  stored 191 a ehasad a t abase, then it makes sense to aay *Nom to the quelrtian %ere anybasaltic rocks brought back?
* Bag if no oolcanoea are staredfor the U. S,, it does not f o l l m  that the aurto the question "Are there any mlcandee in the U.

A moreappropriate answer i s  *I dont.t know.'
P u t t h e  re, it makes8en.e to ask *at the smallest b lock  in a scene is or the r o c kw i a  l eas t  a l m i n m  c~ncmtRat f sn ,  But it makes no sense to askwhat is t he  malleat  c i t y  in Braz i l  or the leaat  fin the  U.
S, It uould be an appmpriate strategy for decidinghow many flights f r o m  Boston to Chitago are nonstop, to considereach flight and count how mny make O stops.
But it would notbe an appropriate strategy to consider each person smred in a1hPted h t a  base (such as h s b v e ) ,  in orden to answer thequestion *How many people in the U. S. are over 30 years old?
"Within open worlds there are cbsed sets,  so tha t  a question l i k e'How many states are on the Pacific?'
makes sense whereae 'Howmany cities are on the Pacific?"
does not.
SCAOLAR dais w i t hthie by distinguishing exhaustive sets  from n~n-exhaustive sets.We w i l l  d iscuss  in Sect ion  4 how SdlHOmR Begins to deal withopen mrld semantics.
We essmtial point  here is that the well-defined pmcadums t h a t  are appropriate for a closed world s h p l ydo n o t  carry over to an open world.
Unfortunately,  m a t  of hknowledge is open-ended, and w people have complex strategies fordeal ing with uncertainty and facing problears such as how to applynew a t t r ibu tes  ar values Lo objects where they haven't applied inthe paete3 3me two-valued logic that undatliee the propasitionalcalculus and related approachee to inference c a ~ o t  encompassnatural ssltwa cs.
The tfouble arises because truth varies indegree, in t h e ,  in range, in c e r t a i n t y ,  and in p o i n t  o f  view ofthe observer, when it is applied to real-world objects.
We willbriefly examine some of the implications of the multivalued na tu reor t g u % P a  fo r  n a t u r a l  smaatica,olVc logic uses quantif i ce t ion  to d i s t i n g u i s h  betweenthe universal and the particular, e.g., between "All men arem r t d W  and amme men b v e  mrts, "" But *ere is no allowancemde for the degrees of t r u t h  as between say "Some nren have wartsRand .Some men have ears,* even though on ly  a fract ion have wartsand a &t a l l  haw ears, Pwple  w i l l  i n f e r  t h a t  Mewbn had ears(given no info t i o n  to the  contrary as w i t h  Van Gogh) , b u t  willnot in f er  *at Nets&an had warts, The inference in *e fomercase t reats  the particular l i k e  the universal, because almostall men have ears.
The more  generally trw a statement is, themore certainty people assign to such an inference.
There j u s t  arenot  many universal truths to be found o u t  i n  the cold, c r u e l  world,and so p a ~ p l e  make the Best of it,Degree of truth mries not only w i t h  respect ta fuzzyvariables (see Section 3.1) and quantification.

What these examples aredesigned to show is e a t  people are u n c e r t a i n  about the t r u t h  ofany p r o p a i t i o n  for a var ie ty  of reasons.
Sometimes people seemto merge a l l  the many sources of u n c e r t a i n t y  together, butsomethes they can distinguish d i f f e r e n t  aspects sf a e i runcer t a in ty  w i t h  respect to a s i n g l e  proposition.SCMOLM does not wow have m y  means far  representinguncer t a in ty ,  but  t h e  n a t u r a l  way to add such info t i a n  is i ntags stored along w i t h  t he  I-tags.
J u s t  ae w i t h  I-tagsp U-tagscan apply at a l l  edded levels of a e  data base.
B e a u s e  wehave ~ t a r t e d  on prsgr ng uncertain in'ferences (discussed below),it has be~orrme desfraB%e ka represent the under ly ing uncertaintyin cIatxa base as well., %n order ta e v a l u t e  how cer ta in  anyinference m y  be,4 , Natural PfifereneesW e  classify h u m  senoantic inferences i n t o  Pour major types:deductive, negative, fue t ionaE,  and indue t i=  inferences ,  Thevarioue t n e s  are discussed in gomewhat greater deUP1 in mBlias5and Quillian7 and C o l l i n s ,  Carbonell, and Warnock We donot argue mat these describe all the inferential strategies thatpeople use, but only some of the major varieties .
The d i f f e r e n tstrategies described are being implmented as subroutines inSCWO m i l e  we think that people have a large eet of suchstrategies, the n er is probably less than one hundred.Therefore, desp i te  the inelegance of such an approach, we do notregard it as an endless  t a s k  to encompass the bag of i n f e r e n t i a ltricks a person uses,In Figure 3 we have included excerpts from tape-recordeddialogues between h n tutares and s t u d m t s  to i l lustrate  someof the more complicated strategies people use, and t h e  ways theyca&ine togethere We will discuss examples i n d i v i d u a l l ybe low,4.1 Deductive InferencesThere are several transitive relations that people usefrequently to i n f e r  that a property of one thing may be a propertyof the other.
These include superordinate, superpart, similari ty,proximity, s rdinate, and eubpart relat ions.O f  the above types SCHO now h a n a e s  o n l y  s u p r a r d i n a t eand superpart infersnces, mich are the mast co n. For example,if asked *Does the Llanos have a r a iny  seas~n?~, SCHOLAR willThere is some j ung le  in here (points  to Venezuela) butthis breaks i n t o  a savanna around the Orinoco ,Oh r ight ,  that is where they grow the coffee up there?I don't think that  the savanna is used for  growingcoffee.

Tutor-Student  Dialogue Excerptsf irs t  l o o k  under Llanos and failing to find the infothere, will look under Llanosv S U P E X  (for superordinate), whichis savanna, and its SUPEW (far superpart), which is Venezuelaand Colombia.
A rainy season i s  a property of savannas and sothe superordinate in ference  p r o v i e s  the answer.
The superpartinference is less general because it i s  restricted to certainattltlbutes such as climate, language, and topography.
One wouldnot want to conclude that the capital of Massachusetts isWashington, D. C., j u s t  because Massachusetts is part of theUnited Shates, Because moat properties of a sdperordinate orsuperpart are only generally true, and hot universally true,exceptions must be stored to preclude an incorrect inference(~a~heel'~).similarity and proximity inferences parallel the eupemrdihateand superpart inferences, but they carry less cer ta inty .
An ex-ample of a person using a pmximity inference  i s  sham in thelatter part of the tutor's response in EThe tutor f irst  said tha t  a savanna could no t  be used fo r  growingcaf f ee ,  but  then he backed off  this conelusion because of theproximity of the large Brazilian savanna to the coffee-growingregion there.
To illustrate a similarity inference: if oneknows a wallaby is like a kangaroo, Only amaller ,  then one willinfer that a wallaby probably has a pouch.
W e  plan to addsimilarity information to SCHOLAR in the near future,  because itwill also  be useful in making functioaal analogies which arediscussed below.
The tecently added map f a c i l i t y  (Harnock and~ollins'') which ties together visual and semantic representations,makes proximity inferences possible, but they are still a way off.Subordinate and subpart i n f  erencee follow a somewhat d i f f e r e n tpattern f r o m  the athers discussed.
If asked whether South rfcaproduces any o i l ,  a person will answer "YesM because Venezuela,which is part of South America, produces oil.
But one does no twant to conclude that South merica is ho t  because the mazonjungle is.
We haven't warked out the deta i ls  of the r e s t r i c t i o n son these inferences  as ye t .There are other  transi t ive  re la t ions  that are used to mkedeductive inferences  but they are not as prevalent  as the oneso u t l i n e d  here,Negative information, such as t h e  fact that men do not havewheels, is no t  usually stared but rather in fe r red .
In a closedworld t h i a  presents  no prablemt it is reaeondle  to assume thatif something it?
n o t  stored, then it is not  true.
In f a c t r  ear lyversions of SCHOLAR say * N o w  if asked "fs o i l  a product of Brazi l?
"just because oil isn't storad for Brazil.
But in the real  warld,t he  f a c t  Ulat somthing is not stored does n o t  necessarily meant it is not  true.
People seem to have complex strategies fordeciding when to say @ N o w  and when to say @I don't know.
~4 Wehave recently been implementing these  in SCHOLAR.One kind of negative inference now in SCHOLAR is a simplecontradiction procedure.
It relies on contradictory valuesstored wi th  various concepts: for example, barren contradictsfertile, and democracy contradicts dictatorship.
SupposeSCHOLAR i a  asked 1 s  the Pampas barren?
* It would f i n d  the soi lof the Pampas 1s ferti le,  anti since fe r t i l e  contradicts barren,it w u l d  say *No.
The s o i l  of t h e  Pampas is fe r t i l e .
"There is an h p o N a n t  class of contradictions that  are n o tsubsumed under t h e  procedure ve.
For example, conrtider thequestio~ *Is Buenos A i r e s  a c i t y  in Brazil?.
The fact t h a tBuenos Aires is n o t  among t h e  c i t i e s  of B r a z i l  is no reason tosay "Norw because there are eitiea in Braz i l ,  such as Corwhich are not stored.
But there are three facts that ethermake a contradiction possible$ (1) Buenos A i r e s  is located inArgentina, (2) cit ies  only have one location, and 3 )  Argentinaand Brazil are mutually exclusive.
We can i l lustrate  tnenecessity for conditions ( 2 )  and ( 3 )  : (2) even though Portugueseis the language of Portugal, it is alsd the language of Brazi le ,  language can have mbre than one location]; ( 3 )  even thoughSao Paulo is in South America, it is also i n  Brazil .
SouthAmerica and Brazil are not mutually exclusive).
Making anincorrect negative inference about cities w i t h  more than onelocation (e.g.
Kansas City)  or different c i t ies  w i t h  the samename (Rome, New York, and Rome, Italy) is precluded by storingbath locations specifically, just as with deductive inferences .The strategy we have worked o u t  and implemented to find differentcontradictions of t h i s  kind is f a i r l y  complex.Failure to find a contradic t ion leads to anather kind ofnegative inference people - use which we c a l l  the lack-of -knowledge5 inference ( C o l l i n s ,  Carbonell and Warnock .
Ex le 2 ofFigure  3 shows the tutor using this strategy.
The baeiB of thet u b r w s  i n f e r ence  is this: since he knows as muck a b u t  otherSou* merican countries as he knows about Venezuela, it is ap l a u s i b l e  but uncer ta in  i n f e r ence  that.
if other countries produceda i l ,  he would h o w  about L t .
( h i s  conclusion was at leas tsomavhat wrong, because there are in fact several other aountriesin South Ame~ica that produce o i l .
though far those countries oilis not nearly so important a% it is for  Venezuela.
)Sach a s t ra tegy  is c u r r e n t l y  being implemented in SCHO inthe following way: If asked a ques t ion  l i k e  *Is o i l  a product ofUruguay?"
where no a i l  is stored, SCHOLAR can look f o r  oil undera i d l a r  object8 k e g .
,  Venezuela or B r a z i l )  or objects w i t h  thes m e  SUPEX and SWEW, ff SCHOWR finds sik stored w i aVenezuela (say wi th  an 1 -tag of 3)  and if it has enought i o n  stored a b u t  Uruguay (up to an I-mg of 8, s a y )to know about oil if it were a t  a l l  important, then it can i n f e rthat  Uruguay probably has no I .
The degree of c e r t a i n t yexpressed in the answer ~hould depend on the difference in I-tagsen the depth of what it knms ut Uruguay and the level atwhich o i l  is stored w i t h  s M l a r  ob jecta.
If SCHOLAR can f i n d  nosimilar objects t h a t  have property in question, as with "Issand a product of Uruguay?"
the appropriate answer is somethinglike *I donot know whether sand is a product of any country inSouth America."
The 'heaakk-of-knowledge inference is based on theassumption that  one's knowledge is fairly coneistent for similarobjects.4 .
3  Functional InferencesF m c  tional inferences are ca n in the dialogues we collected6 (Ccllins, Wainock, and Passafiume ) .
Examples 1, 3, and 4 inFigure 3 i l lus tra te  the three different ways m have seen peopleuse functional knowledge: in quasi calculations, in analogies,and in anmer to 'whyw quest ions .Functional knowledge, which includes knowledge about func-t ional  determinants and their intgractions,  ie learned, j u s t  asis factual knowledge, and therefore is stored in SCHOLAR'S database under concept8 such as climate or agricultural products.
WewuPd argue t the representation of funct ional  knowledgeshould be in a f o m  that different procedures can use.
Oneproblem is to find a why to represent such knowledge in SCHOLARso tha t  it can be more or less precise, and st i l l  be accessibleto di f f eren t  s a r s m ~ n e s  that.
infer anmers to quest ions  or t h a tdescribe the functional relation to students.FmctPanaB calculations can be used Pa both.
a positive andnegative my.
One simple positive func t ion  now in SCHOLARcalculates the climate of a place if the information is notstwed,  Based ow the major functional dete nawts of climate,which are l a t i t ude  m d  a l t i t u d e ,  SCMOUR will i n f e r  *ether t h eclimate is tropical,  sub-*apical, temperate, or cold/palar.
Anegative use 0% ca lcu la t ion  based on t h e  a g r i c u l t u r a l  productse m ~ t i ~ n  is show in me first pa9$ of the  tutoro s aaamr inExample 1.
The f u n c t i o n a l  determinants of agricultural productsPwelude the c l $ m a & e ,  s o i l ,  and r a i n f a l l ,  The t u t o r  pieked thelack of r a i n  as a basis for  a t en ta t ive  wNo.w N q a t i v e  cabcula-t i a n s  do n o t  require as precise knawledge as positive calculations.They often only require t h a t  one or two of the f u n c t i o n a ld e t e m i n a n t s  have an inappropriate value.Like funcf ional  calculatione,  functional analogies can bemeitive or negative.
Example 3 shows the tutor making a positivefunctional analogy, again with the agricultural products function.Phere he thought of a region, western Texas, tha t  matched the2haeo En terns of climate a d  ra infa l l ,  the functiokaf B e t e m i n -snts  of cattle raising, Since he knew that western Wxas wasc a t t l e  country he inferred that  the  Chaco might be as well.
Anegative f nnc t ional  analogy might have occurred if the studenthad asked whether the Chiieo produced rubber.
S ince  the zonjungle and Xndonesfa produce rubber, the tutor could have saidW N ~ W  on the  basis of the mismtch between the Chaea and thoseregions,  w i t h  respect to climate and r a i d f a l l .A positive and negative analogy subroutine has beenimplemented in SCHOLAR.
It is a fa l lback strategy to be usedicf them is not enough i n f o  t f s n  stared calculate a efunctional relationship.
For a functional analogy it is onlynecessary to know the functionally relevant a l t r f iu te s  and Uaeirrelative importance.
Then SCHOLAR looks to see if it knows anysimilar objects where the property in question is in fact stored.I t  tries to find a match or a mismatch by comparing t h e  gioenobject and the similar object w i t h  respect to their values onthe  Eunctiollally relevant attributes.
People frequently uaesuch analogical reasoning, probably because of the  ill-definednature of their knawledge about funct ional  relations.The laet example in Figure 3 sh&s the use of a functionalrelation to anewer a @Whyw question.
The population density ofa place depends on an indefinite set o f  functional determinants:climate, soil, and rainfall are major ones but distance from thesea, the par'icular c o n t i n e n t ,  presence o f  valuable minerals, allcontribute in different ways.
The tutor picked one determinantt had a value inapprgpriate for  a large population densityand gave that  as a reason.
By contrast a geographer couldprobably mite a mole treatise on why the Chaco has a l o wpspulation d m s i t y ,  W h a t  we aspire POP SCHOLAR to do 1s w h t  thetumr didp that is, to pick one or t w o  of the rnarmr d e t e m i n a n t awi t21  appropriate values and give those as a reason.Q,4 Xndubtive InferencesWe menuon induc t ive  i n f e r e n c e s  here only because they area major class  of human inference .
We have n o t  ye t  t r i e d  toprogrm *em in I A R  since they occur m s t l y  i n  staringrather than retrieving i n foma t ion ,  The generalization and d f s -c r i d n a t i o n  processes underlyfwg i n d u e t i  on have been dasenssed7' in detai l  elsewhere (~eeker'; W I R S ~ O P ~ ~ ~ ;  C o l l i n s  and Quillian ) a4.5The inferential procdaserr described can combine in a ~ r i e t yof ways.
For inehance, contradictions can combine w i t h  deductiveinferences.
SCBOWLR will anmer a question like "Is the A t l a n t i corange?"
w i t h  wNo, it is blue, because it finds blue fe atoradwith the SUPER.
,  ocean.
Also one fanctfanal inference may c a l lanother.
If the agricultural products function needs a value forbhe climate of some region, it could call the climate function tocompute it.A more important way that inferences combine s h o w s  up whendif ferent  strategies reach independent canclusiona about the samequestion.
A good example is Example I. in Figure 3 .
Them anegative functional inference,  w k t h  an implicit lack-of-knowledgeihferance, f i es t  led to a tentative * N o u  mawer,  but *en aproximity inference produced a possible 'Yeem a n s w e r ,  and so thetutor backed off his earlier ""No."
men several inferences co-ineto yield the s m e  conclusion, a e y  increase the certainty ofanswer, and when they produce oppasite eoneluslons, a e y  deressethe certainty,There are a n er of sources of mcerainty in in f eren t ia lprocedures.
Uncertainty can derive from the s i z e  sf Ule diffemrencebetween I-tags &n Ule lack-of-knowledge inference, it can derivefrom the degree of match or mismatch in a functional analogy.
itcan derive from the degree of predictivcanees of the func t iona ldateminants, andl as m discussed earlier, it can derive f m m  Uaedegree of certainty about the info t f o n  storad.
Theae s o u c e sof uncertainty may be c ined ta produce an overdl  uncertainty9 (see for example tling This overall uncertainty ia importantso that long, tenuous chains of reasoning are not pursued to theirpointless end, and so that  the degree o f  uncer ta in ty  in the a n s w e rcan be Sadicated to the student,5, Copcluaionswhat we have tr ied Ca show in t h i s  paper i s  the fuzzy, ill-def Fned, mcer-in na ture  of much of h n howledge and thinking.We want = H O U R  ta be just aa  fuzxy- th inking as we are.6,This paper was started by Jaim R.
