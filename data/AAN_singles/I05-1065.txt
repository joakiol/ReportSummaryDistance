In this paper, a resolution system is presented to tackle nominal andpronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using rich set of syntactic andsemantic features.
Unlike previous researches, the verification of semantic as-sociation between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated by exploitingmore outer resources, including UMLS, WordNet, GENIA Corpus 3.02p andPubMed.
Moreover, the resolution is implemented with a genetic algorithm onits feature selection.
Experimental results on different biomedical corporashowed that such approach could achieve promising results on resolving thetwo common types of anaphora.1   IntroductionCorrect identification of antecedents for an anaphor is essential in message under-standing systems as well as knowledge acquisition systems.
For example, efficientanaphora resolution is needed to enhance protein interaction extraction from biomedi-cal literature by mining more protein entity instances which are represented withpronouns or general concepts.In biomedical literature, pronominal and nominal anaphora are the two commontypes of anaphora.
In past literature, different strategies to identify antecedents ofan anaphor have been presented by using syntactic, semantic and pragmatic clues.For example, grammatical roles of noun phrases were used in [9] [10].
In addition tothe syntactic information, statistical information like co-occurring patterns obtainedfrom a corpus is employed during antecedent finding in [3].
However, a large corpusis needed for acquiring sufficient co-occurring patterns and for dealing with datasparseness.On the other hand, outer resources, like WordNet1, are applied in [4][12][15] andproved to be helpful to improve the system like the one described in [12] where ani-macy information is exploited by analyzing the hierarchical relation of nouns andverbs in the surrounding context learned from WordNet.
Nevertheless, using Word-Net alne for acquiring semantic information is not sufficient for solving unknownwords.
To tackle this problem, a richer resource, the Web, was exploited in [16]1http://wordnet.princeton.edu/Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 743where anaphoric information is mined from Google search results at the expense ofless precision.The domain-specific ontologies like UMLS2 (Unified Medical Language System)has been employed in [2] in such a way that frequent semantic types associated toagent (subject) and patient (object) role of subject-action or action-object patterns canbe extracted.
The result showed such kind of patterns could gain increase in bothprecision (76% to 80%) and recall (67% to 71%).
On the other hand, Kim and Park[11] built their BioAR to relate protein names to SWISS-Prot entries by using thecentering theory presented by [7] and salience measures by [2].In this paper, a resolution system is presented for tackling both nominal anaphoraand pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using various kinds of syntacticand semantic features.
Unlike previous approaches, our verification of the semanticassociation between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated with the help of bothgeneral domain and domain-specific resources.
For example, the semantic type check-ing for resolving nominal anaphora can be done by the domain ontology UMLS andPubMed3, the search engine for MEDLINE databases.
Here, UMLS is used not onlyfor tagging the semantic type for the noun phrase chunks if they are in UMLS, butalso for generating the key lexicons for each type so that we can use them to tag thosechunks if they are not in UMLS.
If no type information can be obtained from anchunk, then its type finding will be implemented through the web mining of PubMed.On the other hand, the domain corpus, GENIA 3.02p corpus [20] is exploited whilewe solve the semantic type checking for pronominal anaphora.
With simple weightcalculation, the key SA/AO (subject-action or action-object) patterns for each typecan be mined from the corpus and they turn out to be helpful in resolution.
Beside thesemantic type agreement, the implicit resemblance between an anaphor and its ante-cedents is another evidence useful for verifying the semantic association.
Hence, thegeneral domain thesaurus, WordNet, which supporting more relationship betweenconcepts and subconcepts, is also employed to enhance the resemblance extraction.The presented resolution system is constructed on a basis of a salience grading.
Inorder to boost the system, we implemented a simple genetic algorithm on its selectionof the rich feature set.
The system was developed on the small evaluation corpusMedStract 4 .
Nevertheless, we constructed a larger test corpus (denoted as ?100-MEDLINE?)
so that more instances of anaphors can be resolved.
Experimental resultsshow that our resolution on MedStract can yield 92% and 78% F-Scores on resolvingpronominal and nominal anaphora respectively.
Promising results were also obtainedon the larger corpus in terms of 87.43% and 80.61% F-scores on resloving pronomi-nal and nominal anaphora respectively.2   Anaphora ResolutionFigure 1 is the overview of the presented architecture, including the extraction ofbiomedical SA/AO patterns and semantic type lexicons in background processing2http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/3http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/4http://www.medstract.org/744 T.

1.
System architecture overview2.1   Syntactic Information ExtractionBeing important features for anaphora resolution, syntactic information, like POS tagsand base NP chunks, is extracted from each document by using the Tagger5.
Mean-while, each NP will be tagged with its grammatical role, namely, ?Oblique?, ?Directobject?, ?Indirect object?, or ?Subject?
by using the following rules which wereadopted from [22] by adding rules 5 and 6.5http://tamas.nlm.nih.gov/tagger.htmlPronominal AnaphorSyntactic InformationExtractionAnaphor RecognitionAntecedent SelectionTextsDocument ProcessingNominal AnaphorSemantic Type Lexi-con ExtractionKeylexicons foreach typePubMedSearchResults Salience GradingWordNet2.0Semantically-taggedSA/AO ExtractionUMLS2003ACMetathesaurusGENIACorpus3.02pSemanticSA/AOPatternsNumber AgreementCheckRule1: Prep NP (Oblique)Rule2: Verb NP (Direct object)Rule3:  Verb [NP]+ NP (Indirect object)Rule4: NP (Subject) [?,[^Verb], ?|Prep NP]* VerbRule5: NP1 Conjunction NP2 (Role is same as NP1) Conjunction]Rule6:  [Conjunction] NP1 ( Role is same as NP2 ) Conjunction NP2Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 745Rules 5 and 6 are presented for dealing those plural anaphors in such a way that thesyntactic agreement between the first antecedent and its anaphora is used to find otherantecedents.
For example, without rules 5 and 6, ?anti-CD4 mAb?
in Example 1 willnot be found when resolving anaphora ?they?.2.2   Semantic Information ExtractionBeside the syntactic clues, the semantic agreement between an anaphor and its ante-cedents can also facilitate anaphora resolution in domain-specific literature.
In thispaper, the semantic information for each target noun phrase chunk can be extractedwith the help of the domain ontology, UMLS, which supports the semantic type forthe chunk.
However, the semantic types for those chunks which are not in UMLS areneeded to be predicted.
Therefore we need to extract the key lexicons from UMLS foreach semantic type in background processing and use them to tag unknown chunkwith predicted types.
On the other hand, the semantic type checking for pronominalanaphors is done through the extraction of the key verbs for each semantic type.Hence, a domain corpus GENIA 3.02p is exploited in background processing.2.2.1   Key Lexicons for Each Semantic TypeFor each UMLS semantic type, its key lexicons are mined as the following steps inFigure 2:Fig.
2.
Procedure to mine key lexicons for each semantic typeA.
Collect all UMLS concepts and their corresponding synonyms as typelexicon candidates.B.
Tokenize the candidates.
For example, concept ?interleukin-2?
hassynonyms ?Costimulator?, ?Co-Simulator?, ?IL 2?, and ?interleukine 2?.Then ?interleukin?, ?costimulator?, ?simulator?, ?IL?, and ?interleukine?will be treated as lexicon candidates.C.
For each candidate, calculate its weight wij for each type by using Eq.
(1) which takes into account its concentration and distribution.
A prede-fined threshold is given for the final selection of the candidates.

We tagged each base noun phrase chunk from the cor-pus with its grammatical role and tagged it with UMLS-semantic type.
Then we usedEq.
2 to score each pattern.
At resolution, an antecedent candidate is concerned if itsscores are greater than a given threshold.

Pro-nominal anaphora recognition is done by filtering pleonastic-it instances by using theset of hand-craft rules presented in [12].
On two corpora, namely, Medstract and thenew 100-Medline corpus, 100% recognition accuracy was achieved.
The remainingnoun phrases indicated with ?it?, ?its?, ?itself?, ?they?, ?them?, ?themselves?
or ?their?are considered as pronominal anaphor.
Others like ?which?
and ?that?
used in relativeclauses are treated as pronominal anaphors and are resolved by the following rules.Rule 1: ?that?
is treated as pleonastic-that if it is paired with pleonastic-it.Rule 2: For a relative clause with ?which?
or ?that?, the antecedents will be thenoun phrases preceding to ?which?
or ?that?.On the other hand, noun phrases shown with ?either?, ?this?, ?both?, ?these?, ?the?,and ?each?
are considered as nominal anaphor candidates.
Nominal anaphora recogni-tion is approached by filtering those anaphor candidates, which have no referent ante-cedents or which have antecedents but not in the target biomedical semantic types.Following are two rules used to filter out those non-target nominal anaphors.Rule 1: Filter out those anaphor candidates if they are not tagged with one of thetarget UMLS semantic types (the same types in [2])Rule 2: Filter out ?this?
or ?the?
+ proper nouns with capital letters or numbers.Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 747We treated all other anaphors indicated with ?this?
or ?the + singular-NP?
as singu-lar anaphors which have one antecedent only.
Others are treated as plural nominalanaphors and their numbers of antecedents are shown in Table 2.
At antecedent selec-tion, we can discard those candidates whose numbers differ from the correspondinganaphors.Table 2.

Salience grading for candidate antecedentsFeatures ScoreF1recency0, if in two sentences away from anaphor1, if in one sentence away from anaphor2, if in same sentence as anaphor 0-2F2 Subject and Object Preference 1F3 Grammatical function agreement 1F4 Number Agreement 1F5 Semantic Longest Common Subsequence 0 to 3F6 Semantic Type Agreement -1 to +2F7 Biomedical antecedent preference -2 if not or +2The first feature F1 is recency which measures the distance between an anaphorand candidate antecedents in number of sentences.
From the statistics of the two cor-pora, most of antecedents and their corresponding anaphors are within in two sentencedistance, so a window size for finding antecedent candidates is set to be two sentencesin the proposed system.
The second feature F2 concerns the grammatical roles that an748 T. Liang and Y.-H. Linanaphor plays in a sentence.
Since many anaphors are subjects or objects so antece-dents with such grammatical tags are preferred.
Furthermore, the antecedent candi-dates will receive more scores if they have grammatical roles (feature F3) or numberagreement (feature F4) with their anaphors.On the other hand, features 5, 6, and 7 are related to semantic association.
Feature5 concerns the fact that the anaphor and its antecedents are semantical variants ofeach other, so antecedents will receive different scores (as shown below) on the basisof their variation:Following are examples to show the cases:Fig.

Asdescribed in figure 3, the type finding for each antecedent can implemented with thehelp of UMLS.
When there is no type information can be obtained from an antece-dent, the type finding can be implemented with the help of PubMed, and the gradingon such antecedent will be as Eq.
3.
Feature 7 is biomedical antecedent preference.That is an antecedent which can be tagged with UMLS or the key lexicons databasewill receive more score.2.4.2   Antecedent Selection StrategiesThe noun phrases which precede a recognized anaphor in the range of two sentenceswill be treated as candidates and will be assigned with zero at initial state by the pre-sented salience grader.
Antecedents can be selected by the following strategies.
(1) Best First: select antecedents with the highest salience score that is greaterthan a threshold(2) Nearest First: select the nearest antecedents whose salience value is greaterthan a given thresholdFor plural anaphors, their antecedents are selected as follows:(1) If the number of the antecedents is known, then select the same number oftop-score antecedents.
(2) If the number of antecedents is unknown, then select those antecedent candi-dates whose scores are greater than a threshold and whose grammatical pat-terns are the same as the top-score candidate.2.5   Experiments and AnalysisAs mentioned in previous sections, a larger corpus was used for testing the proposedsystem.
The corpus, denoted as ?100-Medline?, contains 100 MEDLINE abstractsincluding 43 abstracts (denoted as ?43-Genia?
in Table 6) randomly selected fromGENIA 3.02p and another 57 abstracts (denoted as ?57-PubMed?
in Table 6) collectedfrom the search results of PubMed (by issuing ?these proteins?
and ?these receptors?
inorder to acquire more anaphor instances).
There is no common abstract in the publicMedStract and the new corpus.
Table 4 shows the statistics of pronominal and nomi-nal anaphors for each corpus.Table 4.

One is to in-vestigate the impact of the features which are concerned in the resolution.
Another isto compare different resolution approaches.
In order to boost our system, a simple750 T. Liang and Y.-H. Lingeneric algorithm is implemented to yield the best set of features by choosing bestparents to produce offspring.In the initial state, we chose features (10 chromosomes), and chose crossover fea-ture to produce offspring randomly.
We calculated mutations for each feature in eachchromosome, and evaluated chromosome with maximal F-Score.
Top 10 chromo-somes were chosen for next generation and the algorithm terminated if two contigu-ous generations did not increase the F-score.
The time complexity associated withsuch approach is O(MN) where M is the number of candidate antecedents, N is num-ber of anaphors.Table 5.

Table5 also shows that the semantic features play more important role than the syntacticfeatures for nominal anaphora resolution.
Similar results can be also found in Table6 where the impact of each feature is justified.
Moreover, Table 6 indicates that thepronominal anaphora resolution on 43-Genia is better than that on the other twocorpora.
It implies that the mined SA/AO patterns from GENIA 3.02p corpus areAnaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 751helpful for pronominal anaphora resolution.
Moreover, Table 7 proves that the keylexicons mined from UMLS for semantic type finding indeed enhance anaphoraresolution, yet a slight improvement is found with the usage of PubMed searchresults.
One of the reasons is few unknown instances in our corpora.On the other hand, comparisons with evaluation corpus, Medstract, were shownin Table 8 where the best-first strategy yielded higher F-score than the results by thenearest-first strategy.
It also shows that the best-first strategy with the best selectionby genetic approach achieves higher F-scores than the approach presented in [2].Table 7.

The resolution is constructed with a salience grading on variouskinds of syntactic and semantic features.
Unlike previous researches, we exploit moreresources, including both domain-specific and general thesaurus and corpus, to verifythe semantic association between anaphors and their antecedents.
Experimental re-sults on different corpora prove that the semantic features provided with the help ofthe outer resources indeed can enhance anaphora resolution.
Compared to other ap-proaches, the presented best-first strategy with the genetic-algorithm based featureselection can achieve the best resolution on the same evaluation corpus.References1.
