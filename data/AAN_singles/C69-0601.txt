6 Classification: TG 2.1Some formal properties of phonological redundancy rules.Stephan Braun*i. Introduction.Redundancy is a well-known phenomenon of phonemesor phonological matrices within the framework of thedistinctive-feature theory of JAKOBSON and HALLE Ill QRedundancy in this theory means that the specification(either + or -) of certain features of a phoneme ispredictable given the specifications of certain otherfeatures of the same phoneme and/or of neighbouringphonemes of a phoneme sequence.
These restrictions onfeature specifications are usually expressed by"redundancy rules".
E.g.
in English all nasal phonemesvoiced which is expressed by a rule ~+nasal\] --~ are~voice~, to be read as "each phoneme which is specified~nasaq  must also be specified E+voice~ ".
Among theredundancy rules usually two main types are distinguishechThose like the one just mentioned which express arestriction valid for each phoneme of a language, in-dependent of possible neighbouring phonemes, will becalled "phoneme-structure rules" (P-rules) in this paper.Besides them, there are rules expressing restrictions onthe admissible phoneme sequences of the language, e.g.English no ~+consonanta~ segment can follow a inmorpheme-initial nasal; they will be called (as usual)"morpheme-structure rules" (M-rules).
In the paper ofSTANLEY ~2\] the former are called segment structurerules and the latter sequence structure rules.The aim of the present paper is to investigate theproperties of phonoiogical redundancy rules on a mathe-8 MUnchen 2Arc isstrasse 21Technische HochschuleWest-Germanymatical basis.
Some of the problems arising in connec-tion with redundancy rules in phonology have been men-tioned already in the work of HALLE ~3\] where they aretreated essentially on a l inguistically intuitive basis.The paper of UNGEHEUER r#\] on the mathematical proper-ties of the distinctive feature system (using Booleanalgebra by virtue of the fact that every feature canhave exactly two specifications) mentions redundancywithout going, however, into details.
A very thoroughand comprehensive treatment of the subject is given inthe already mentioned paper of STANLEY where a formalway of arguing is used though no mathematical proofs aregiven.
At any rate, STA~EY 's  results show that a forma-lized treatment of phonological redundancy is sensible.Most recently, redundancy rules have been discussed inthe work of CHOMSKY and HALLE ~5\]The results of the present paper essentially con-firm - as far as the questions are the same - the re-sults of STANLEY being, however, somewhat more precisethan his.
The main result is that the complete set ofP-rules for a set of fully specified phonemes can bederived from the prime implicants of a certain Booleanfunction and thus computed without recurrence tolinguistic intuition, given only the set of phonemes.Algorithms for this task can be found in the mathemati-cal literature (e.g.
MoCLUSKEY ~6\] ).
,This formulationthen also allows in a simple way to test intuitivelyfound P-rules for compatibil ity with a given set ofphonemes.
No hierarchy of the features need be assumedfor this.
Moreover, it is shown that phoneme sequencescan be treated formally like single phonemes (with ahigher number of features); thus all results for singlephonemes hold for phoneme sequences as well, and M-rules are not essential ly different from P-rules.Furthermoret some ideas are given how to compute froma set of P-rules another set of rules which generatejust the non-redundantly specif ied matrices, i.e.
thelexicon; these rules are called "lexicon rules" (L-rules).
Finally, two questions connected with the intro-duction into phonological matrices of blanks for redun-dant specif icat ions are discussed, viz.
"When do diffe-rent matrices remain distinct - in the technical senseof \[2\] , p.#08 - after introduction of blanks?"
andthe posit ion of blanks in matrices uniquely determinedby the redundancy rules alone or has an order of appli-cation of the rules to be taken into account?".
It isshown that both dist inctness and uniqueness are guaran-teed if a hierarchy (a total ordering) is int roduce~among the features and if the feature on the right handside of a rule is required to have higher rank withrespect to this hierarchy - e.g.
usual ly \[voicedJ isgiven higher rank than EvocalicJ - than any feature onthe left hand side of the rule.
Counterexamples showthat neither dist inctness nor uniqueness necessar i lyhold if this requirement is not met.Phoneme-structure rules are discussed in Sec.
2,morpheme-structure rules in Seco3, lexicon rules inSec.4 and matrices with blanks in Sec.5.2.
Phoneme-structure rules.As mentioned in the Introduction a phoneme-struc-ture rule (P-rule) is a statement predicting certainfeature specifications of a single phoneme given otherfeature specifications of this phoneme.
In order toformalize this concept some notational conventions will= B ,.
,B a set p be introduced.
Let m ~ 1 "" pJ of fullyspecified phonemes and ~ = {fl .... 'fnl the set of nfeatures and ~ = {+,-J the set of the two possibles~ecifications.
Any phoneme B ~  can then be writtenset of n ordered pairs: B = {~lfl,.O.~Bnfn~ with as a~ iE~ for i=1,...,n. Every set of m~nordered  pairs~ifi containing each feature only once will be called"phonemic set"; the phonemes o f~ are thus special pho-nemic sets.
This set-theoretic notation for phonemes isalmost identical to the usual linguistic n~ation andwill be mainly used throughout this paper; the onlydifference is that no ordering of the features is con-sidered so far.
It turns out that ordering of the fea-tures need be introduced only much later; for the timebeing it would only unnecessarily complicate the proofs.Another notation for phonemes stems from the ob-servation that there are exactly two specifications foreach feature.
The features can, therefore, be conceivedof as Boolean variables taking the values true and falseand a phoneme B can be written as a conjunction of thesevariables.
E.g.
B = -~~+fl'-f2'+f3~ in set-theoreticnotation is replaced by the conjunction B(fl,fy,fs) =flAf--2^f3 (~ is the complement of f taking the valuetru_~e if f takes the value false and vice versa) whichtakes the value tru__~e if and only if fl takes the valuetru___~e, f2 takes the value false and f5 takes the valuetrue.
Thus true corresponds to the specification +,falseto the specification - and B is formed from B by writinginstead of +fi and ~ instead of -fi" This correspon- fiAdence of B and B evidently is biunique.
The whole setof phonemes is in this notation described by the Booleanfunction(I) g(fl' 'fn ) VA.?o = B(fl,...,fn)(Vdenotes  disjunction - the logical or) which takesthe value tru____~e if and only if at least one of theB(fl,...,f n) takes the value true, i.e.
if the B cor-Aresponding to B is a phoneme o f~ .
For the followingthe complement function ~ of g given byV ^ (2) g(fl,...,fn) = C(fl,...,f n)will be of some importance, g describes the set of thosephonemic sets with n features which are not phonemes of~ .
This set which will be denoted by~ is in practicemuch larger than the set~ since there are 2 n phonemicsets with n features while the number p of phonemes of anatural language is much smaller than 2 n for usualvalues of n (e.g.
n=12).A prediction for a feature specification of a singlephonem e (a P-rule) is, in the set-theoretic notation, astatement of the form(3) {~ir l , .O.
,~krk~ --~ ~rwith ,r F, r@r i for i:l,..,k,0~k~n-l, which is to be read as "if the phonemic seta =~i r l , .
.
.
,~krk  J on the left hand side of (5) is apart (a subset) of some phoneme B o f~ then the feature *)r is in B necessar i ly  specif ied as~"  .
Note that thecondit ion at'B corresponds to STA~EY 's  "submatrix inter-pretat ion of rule application" (cp, E2J,p.413).Now, in order for (3) to be called a predict ion ina sensible sense of this word two obvious requirementsmust be fulf i l led:(i) a must occur in at least one phoneme of(ii) ~ must be uniquely determined by a and r~or s impl ic i ty we add a further requirement(iii) a must be minimal, i.e.
there is no phonemic setb~a such that b and r already suffice to uni-quely determine the specif icat ion of r in B.Since by (ii) a uniquely pred ic ts~ as specif ica-tion of r there is no phoneme P~ such that the phone-h = au~r~ (i.e.
a plus the feature r specif ied mic setas~,  wr i t ten ~ "as  set-theoretlc union) **) is a subset ofP.
Any phonemic set with n features containing h is,therefore, an element of ~ .
A phonemic set h with thisproperty is called im~licant o f~ .
~ore specifically,we define the notion of prime implicant of ~ :Def in i t ion lA phonemic set h = {~ir l  , .... ~mrm~ (l~m~n) iscalled prime implicant of ~ if and only ifh ' (a) there is no BE~ such that ~B.~) The case k:O means "r is specif ied as ~ in  eachphoneme o f~" .
** )~= + for ~= - and ~ = - for ~ = +.
(b) for every proper subset b~h there exists aB~ such that b C B.Condit ion (b) of Def.1 expresses a minimal ity require-ment on h which will turn out to be closely related torequirement (iii) above.The name "prime implicant" for h was chosen becausein the Boolean notation of eqs.
(1) and (2) the conjunc-tion h corresponding to h is a prime implicant (in thetechnical sense of the theory of Boolean functions) ofthe function ~, eq.
(2): An implicant of a Boolean func-tion v of n variables is a conjunct ion q of m~n of thesevariables such that v is tru____~e whenever q is true; equi-valently, if t is any conjunction of the n variableswhich contains q then t = true implies v = true.
q is aprime implicant of v if it is an implicant of v and ifevery proper part s of q is not an implicant of v;equivalently, if there is at least one conjunction w ofthe n variables containing s such that w = tru___~e impliesv = false (or V = tru___~e).
By condit ion (a) of Def.1 P~I~for every phonemic set P with n features with h~P; inBoolean notat ion ~ is any n_place conjunction containingh and P~ ~ means P = tru__~e implies ~ = tru___~e.
Thus h is animplicant of ~.
Condit ion (b) of Def.1 in Boo leannotation reads "if ~ then there is a B with bOB suchAthat B = true implies g = tru___~e (or ~ = fals__~e)".
Thusis a prime implicant of ~.The remarks fol lowing condit ions (i) through (iii)together with Def.1 suggest a connection between primeimplicants of l~ and P-rules.
This is expressed byTheorem 11.
From each prime implicant h = ~ l r l , .
.
.
,~mrm~ of~2.Proof:I.2.m P-rulesPj = aj --~ ~jrj (j=l,...,m)with aj = h \~ j r j~  (i?e.
~j is formed from h byomitting ~r~)  can be derived which comply withcon itione lil through (iiiIf P = a - -~r  (a =~l r l , .
.
.
,~krk~ ,kS0) isa P-rule complying with (i) through (iii) thenh = au{~ = ~l r l ' ' ' ' '~krk  '~r~is a prime implicant o f~ .
P is derived from hby 1., and h is uniquely determined by P.Pj evidently has the --f?rm of eq.(3).
Since h isa prime implicant of ~ and a jch  there is, byDef.l(b), a B i~such  that aj C B.
Thus, Pjcomplies with (i)?
The feature rj omitted in ajis in B necessarily specified as ~ j  since itmust be specified somehow and cannot be specifiedas OCj because then h~B contrary to Def.l(a).Thus aj and rj uniquely determine ~ j  and (ii) ismet.
Suppo$6 there is a bca j  such that b and rjalready uniquely determine ~j.
Then there is, byDef.l(a), no B~conta in ing  c = bU~j r j~  .
Butthis contradicts Def.l(b) since c is a properpart of h. Thus there is no such b and P complieswith (iii), too.There is no BG~such  that h~B.
Pot, otherwise,r is specified as ~ instead of ~ in some phonemeo f~ containing a which contradicts (ii).
Thus his, by Def.l(a), an implicant of ~ .
Each propersubset of h is part of a B~:  By (i) and (ii)there exists a BE~ such that c = a~r~ is apart of B.
Each proper subset of c is, therefore,also a part of this B.
Each proper subset of hwhich does not conta iner  is a subset of a, thusa proper subset of c, thus a part of B. Letd = b U ~r~ with boa be a proper subset of h con-taining ~r.
Suppose there is no B~such  that dis a part of B.
Then r is never specif ied as~ inall those phonemes o f~ which contain b (sincebCa  and (i) there are such phonemes) but alwaysas~.
Thus b~a and r suffice to uniquely deter-mine ~which  contradicts (iii) for P. Therefore,also d is a part of some B~.
Thus h is, byDef.l(b), a prime implicant o f~ and, by 1., P isderived from h.Let h' = ~ lS l , .
.
.
,~s~ a prime implicant o f~.Every P-rule derived from h' has the form P' =aj'-@~js .~ For P to be one of these P' a compari-son shows that necessar i ly a\] = a, y~ = ~ andsj = r. Then h' = a \ ]u~js j~  = au{~r}  = h; thush is uniquely determined by P.According to Theorem 1 every P-rule fo r~complying with requirements (i) through (iii) - it seemsrather obvious that a P-rule should meet these require-ments - is derived from a corresponding prime implicanto f~ o The task of f inding all the P-rules fo r~ is,therefore, equivalent to the task of f inding all theprime implicants for ~ or, equivalently, the primeimplicants of the Boolean function ~.
This is a wel l -known mathematical  problem which can be more or lesseff ic iently solved on a computer using e.g.
theMcCLUSKEY algorithm E6S .
(The efficiency of this algo-rithm depends rather strongly on the number n of featu-res; n must not be too large).
Moreover, this resultmeans that, given only the set ~ of fully specifiedphonemes, the discovery of P-rules for this set need notdepend on linguistic intuition; the complete set of P-rules can be computed via the prime implicants ofwhich is, in turn, directly determined bye .By their connection to the prime implicants o f~the P-rules are divided into equivalence classes: twoP-rules will be called equivalent if and only if theyare derived from the same prime implicant o f~ .
ByTheorem 1.2 the connection between P-rule and correspon-ding prime implicant is extremely simple; thus equiva-lence of P-rules is easily tested by comparing the primeimplicants.
Moreover, the compatibility of an intuitive-ly found P-rule with a given set of phonemes can alsoeasily be tested: if a -@Mr  is the P-rule then au(~r  3must be a prime implicant o f~ ; in particular, no pho-neme of the set may contain au{~r)  ?Conditions (i) through (iii) for P-rules or, equi-valently, the requirement that P-rules are to be derivedfrom prime implicants o f~ are essentially identical tothe "true generalization condition" of STANLEY ( K2S,p.421).
In our set-theoretic notation this condition fora rule a -~r  reads( ~ means logical implication).
By the rules of Booleanalgebra this is equivalent to- - I (acBA~r~cB)  for every B ~(-I means negation, A means conjunction), i.e.
there isno B such that h = a U(~r )  CB  which by Def.l(a) meansI0that h is implicant of l~ .
Note that the true genera-l izat ion condit ion is thus not equivalent to h being aprime implicant of ~ ; it does, in other words, notmeet the minimal i ty condit ion (iii).
Because this con-dit ion has turned out in the proof of Theorem 1 to berather convenient it is proposed that (iii) is added tothe true general izat ion condition.As an example consider the five labial consonantsIPl,lbl,/m/,/f/,/v/ of English as given in HA~LE \[7\]  ,see tab.l.
For simplicity only the four featuresStrid + +has - ?
- + - ?
-t a b .
lcont  ~ _ ._ _ + +Voiced - + + - +\[strident\] , \[nasal\] , \[continuant\] and \[voiced\] areconsidered and the specif ications \[-vocalic 3 ,\[+consonantal 3 , ~grave  3 and \[+diffuse\] common to thefive consonants are omitted.
~or this small example theprime implicants of ~ can be computed directly by meansof Def.l: Assuming for convenience a fixed order of thefeatures (e.g.
that of tab.l) one has ordered sequencesof the specif icat ions + and - instead of the sets usedso far.
Then for each k in l~k~n=4 all - (~1.2 k possiblespecif icat ion sequences of length k are formed andmatched with tab.1.
If such a specif icat ion sequencedoes not occur in tab.1 it is an implicant of ~ , andit is a prime implicant o f~ if it does not contain anyshorter implicant already found.
Thus one gets five primeimplicants of ~114) \[+strid, +nasa, {-strid, +cont', {+strid,-cont~,{+nas, +cont I , {+nas ,-voic edJand from them ten P-rules (two for each of the primeimplieants)+str id--@ -nas-st r id- -+ -cont(5) +strid---~ +cont+nas ---@ -cont+nas ~ +voiced+nas ~ -strid+cont ~ +strid-cont ~ -strid+cont ~ -nas-voiced--@ -nasThis is the complete set of P-rules for tab.l; any otherredundancy rule is not a P-rule for this set.3.
Morpheme-structure rulesAccording to the Introduction morpheme-structurerules (M-rules) are predictions for feature specifica-tions of single phonemes within phoneme sequences.
Theonly difference between P-rules and M-rules then is thatM-rules may (but not must) contain features of more thanone phoneme of the sequence (see the example in theIntroduction).
It will be shown that M-rules can likeP-rules be derived from the prime implicants of asuitable Boolean function.
This is done by formally re-ducing the case of phoneme sequences to the case ofsingle phonemes.For sake of simplicity at first only sequencesconsisting of two phonemes o f~ are considered, i.e.sequences BIB 2 with B l~and B 2~1~ .
The n features ofB 1 are denoted by fl,...,fn as before and the n featuresf' Of course, fi and f~ denote the of B 2 as f~,..., n "same phonological feature; they are distinguished merelyformally to indicate their position in the phonemes ofthe sequence.
For formal purposes, however, fi and f~12may be considered to be different features, and thus wehave two sets ~= (fl''''' I , , fn~ and ~ = {fl' ' ' ' 'fn~ offeatures.
Uniting ~ and ~l to form the set F(*)= ~ lwe can conceive of the sequence BIB 2 as a "phoneme of2 nd degree" B ?2)= B 1UB~ with the 2n features of ~cz)where B~ is formed from B 2 by replacing in it fi by fl.E.g.
if ~ ={+f l ,+f2~ and B 2 = ~-fl,+f2~ thenB~) = {+fl'+f2'-f~ '+f2~ Let~)be  the set of all pho-nemes of 2 nd degree (i.el the set of all admissiblephoneme sequences of length two) then 1~ca)is a subset of~X~ s ( X denotes the set-theoretic product) w i th~the original set of phonemes and~ I identical to~except that fi is replaced everywhere by fl.
If everysequence of two phonemes is admissible (this probably isan only theoretical limiting case) then~)=~Ml~ t.After this formal reduction of phoneme sequences tophonemes of higher degree it appears natural to assumethat the M-rules will be nothing but the P-rules for thehigher-order phoneme set, i.e.
they are derivable fromthe prime implioants o f~.
This assumption is suppor-ted by the following:A natural requirement for M-rules is that they re-flect the restrictions on possible phoneme sequences ofa language.
In other words, if every sequence of phone-mes is admissible then the M-rules should coincide withthe P-rules for the set~ .
The following theorem showsthat this is indeed the case:Theorem 2Let ~(~)=~X~ Then any implicant of ~)  whichcontains features of both ~ and ~l  is not a primeimplicant of ~z) .13Proof:Let T~*)= T UT' .with T = \[~ir l  ,...,~krk \] andT' =\[ ~lS{ .... ,~mSm ~ a phonemic set containingthe features r i~ ~ (i=l,...,k) and s\] 6 ~'(j=l,...,m); ~ i~ ,~ jE~.
T and T' containfeatures only from ~ and from ~' , respectively.If neither T nor T' is an implicant of ~c.

B Cz)and COn)can be written a5 BCm= BUB' ,  C~Z)= CUC'with B and C from ~ , B' and C' f rom'~ a .
Sincethe features of T are all from ~ and the featu-res of T' are all from ~ T is a subset not onlyof B Cz) but even of B; likewise, T' is a subset ofC'.
Therefore, To2)= TUT '  is a subset of the setD c~)= BUC' .
Since B~ and C '~ '  we haveD?~)E~x~ l , i.e.
Dc~)EI~) by assumption, andthus T L2) is not an implicant o f~ ?~).
That is, ifT cz) is an implicant o f~ c~) then necessarily oneof its proper subsets T and T' is an imp\]icantof ~(~)which shows that T c,) is not a primeimplicant o f~C~).Thus, if every sequence of phonemes is admissiblethen the prime implicants of ~?

they are prime impli-cants of ~ ; because any prime impli?ant of ~ evidentlyis a prime implicant of ~?~) the sets of prime implicantsof ~ and ~cz) are identical which means that the M-rules fo r~x~ l coincide with the P'rules of ~ .
Primeimplicants of ~c*) other than those of ~ , in particularsuch with features from both phonemes of a two-phoneme14sequence, consequently occur only if ~c2) is a propersubset o fS~ I , i.e.
if not every sequence of phonemesis admissible.
Thus the concept of M-rules as P-rules ofa set of phonemes of higher degree is sensible, and M-rules are to be derived from the prime implicants of ~ cz)in exactly the same manner as P-rules are derived fromthe prime implicants of ~ .Without proof we mention two special cases~ if oHthe first or second posit ion of the sequence the wholeset ~ (or ~ l ,resp.)
is possible then all the primeimplicants of ~ occur among those of ~c~)~ if on thefirst or second posit ion only a single phoneme ispossible then M-rules with more than one feature containfeatures only from ~i or ~ ,respectively.As an example for M-rules assume that from the fivephonemes of tab.~ the three sequences /pf/ , /bv/  and /mb/can be formed.
Denote the features by strid 1,. .
.
,voiced~,strid 2,. .
.
,voiced 2 for the first and second phonemeof the sequence, resp.
In this set of phoneme pairs thespecif ications of the features strid l, cont 1 and nas 2are all fixed as -, and the remaining M-rules are+nas i - -~ {+voiced l,-strid 2,-cont 2,+voiced 2~-nas 1---~ ~+strid 2,+cont 2~+voiced 1 -~ +voiced 2(6) -voiced l~+st r id  2,+cont 2~-voiced 2\]+strid 2 --~ +cont 2-strid 2 --~ ~-cont 2,+voiced 2~-cont 2 ~ +voiced 2where for each of the prime implicants only one rule hasbeen given and for rules with the same left hand side the15right hand sides have been combined for abbreviation.From the preceding it is clear how to extend thedefinitions given to the case of sequences of more thantwo phonemes; in order to get the M-rules one has tofind the prime implicants of ~?~)  with k~3 (k is thelength of the sequence), i.e.
the prime implicants of aBoJlean function of kn variables.
The practical diffi ~culty of this task for larger values of k and n shouldnot be underestimated and here probably further researchis necessary.
In principle, however, all the M-rules ofa language can be computed given only the set of alladmissible phoneme sequences of this language (eachphoneme being fully specified); furthermore, the M-rulesin the literature, e.g.
in HALLE E3~ , can be thus giventested for compatibility with each other and for con-formity with the occurring phoneme sequences.4.
LexicOn rules.Having computed a set of P-rules (or M-rules)predicting the specifications of certain features therules can be used to remove these "redundant" specifi-cations from the phonemes.
It is common in linguisticpractice to replace redundant specifications by blanks.In the set-theoretic notation used here complete removalof redundant elements ~r from the phonemes seems to bemore  adequate.
In this section some ideas will be giventhow to generate the remaining "non-redundant" subsets ofphonemes, i.e.
the lexicon, by a set of new rules calledlexicon rules (L-rules).According to Sec.3 it suffices to consider the caseof P-rules.
Let r ~F  be a feature and leti6(7) a 1 - -@ ~lr,?..,  a k '~k  rbe k P-rules specifying r in different environments; noa contains feature r. Using Boolean notation each~ (j=l,...,k) corresponding to the set aj is a conjunc-tion of some of the Boolean variables fl,...,fn and eachof the P-rules is a logical implication saying that thevalue of the variable r on the right hand side of therule has a certain unique value if the left hand sidehas the value true .The value of r is, therefore, pre-dictable if at least one of the conjunctions aj has thevalue tru_._~e, i.e.
if the Boolean expression(8) a~v~ 2 V .
.
.
V ~khas the va lue t rue .
The va lue  of  r i s ,  there fore ,  notpredictable (i.e.
the specification of r can be either+ or -) if the Boolean expressionA(9) ~r = - '~1  A "-' ~2 A .
.
.A  -~a~which is the negation of (8) has the value true.This makes possible the formulation of a rule(using again set-theoretic notation)(10) a - -~  +rrcalled lexicon rule (L-rule) for ~ , to be read as"if a is a subset of some phoneme of ~ then bothra r U {+r~ and a r U ~-r} are subsets of phonemes o f~ "~These L-rules can then be used to generate the non-redundant phonemic sets o f~ 9 starting with the emptyset ~, by the following prescription: if a phonemic setb occurring in this process of generation contains a rthen it is replaced by the two new phonemic setsb u b U  -rJ.I?In order to make this process straightforward someaddit ional  conventions are introduced:I .
By the usual submatrix interpretat ion of ruleappl icat ion L-rule (10) is applicable to b if and onlyif a r is a subset of b.
To test b for appl icabi l i ty of(l~) it is, therefore, useful to have b already non-redundantly specif ied in all the features occurring ina in order to avoid having (10) not applicable to b ronly because the speci f icat ion of b in one of thesefeatures has not yet been fi l led in.
The simplest way ofth~s ensuring applicabi l i ty,  whenever possible at all,is to introduce an ordering relat ion ( among the featu-res of ~ such that for f,g ~ either f~g or g4fholds.
Ordering of the features is quite common inphonology though it is usual ly introduced at an earl ierstage than here.
In every prime implicant h of I~ thereis, then, one feature f with the highest rank accordingto this ordering and we can require that from all theP-rules derivable from h only the single rule having fon the right hand side shall be chosen.
Since by Theorem1.2 h is uniquely determined by each of its 2-rules nogeneral i ty is lost by this special selection.
In everyP-rule aj --~ ~j r  of (7) the left hand side then contain~only features of a rank less than r, and thus also a r in(10) contains only features of a rank less than r. Allthe L-rules are then ordered in a nathral way: they areapplied in the order of their right hand sides, and thenon-redundant specif icat ions are thus fi l led in "fromtop to bottom" start ing with the lowest-order featureand ending with the highest-order feature.2.
Since any b occurring in the process of generat iont8contains only non-redundant specif ications all specif i -cations in a r predictable via the P-rules from otherspecif icat ions of a r must be removed from a r. If a rconsists of a single specif ied feature occurring in aP-rule c--~a r then c - -~?r is also an L-rule.3.
If ~r for some r is always false then the specif i -cation of r is always predictable and no L-rule concern-A ing r exists; if, on the other hand, a r is always tru___~eor if - which is the case e.g.
with the lowest-orderfeature - no P-rule concerning r exists then thespecif icat ion of r is never predictable which isexpressed by the L-rule ~- -~r  ?With these additional conventions a set of L-rulesis computed by (9) from the iP-rules such that for eachL-rule there is at least one phonemic set to which it isapplicable.As an example consider the P-rules for tab.1.
Forthe order of features as in tab.1 they are given by thefirst column in eq.(5).
~or the lowest-order featurestrid there is the L-rule ~@?str id  since for thisorder no P-rule concerning strid exists.
For has thereis only the P-rule +strid --~-nas, thus - s t r id - -~?nasis an L-rule.
The feature cont is predictable from-strid or from +strid (or from +nas), i.e.
it is alwayspredictable and no L-rule concerning oont exists.
Thefeature voiced occurs only in the P-rL~le +nas-~+vo iced ,thus --~as--~ +voiced is an L-rule, and since+strid - -~-nas is a P-rule we get the addit ional L-rule+st r id - -~vo iced .
Since all a r consist of only onespecif ied feature no further redundancies have to be19removed.
Starting from ~, application of these rulesgives tab.2 containing the lexicon forms of the fivephonemes (with respect to the four features).
It can bedirectly verified that tab.2 is filled up by the rulesof eq.
(5), first column, to give the complete phonemesof tab.1.For another order of the features one has a diffe-rent set of P-rules and, consequently, of L-rules.
Forthe n!
different orders of the n features there are n!different sets of L-rules each of which gives a diffe-rent set of lexicon segments (or lexicon matrices).
Eachof these sets is then filled up by the corresponding setof P-rules to give the complete set of fully specifiedphonemes (or matrices).strid +naseontvoiced ++++ --tab.25.
Matrices with blanks.5.1.
Distinctness.As noted in Seo.4 P-rules can be used to removeredundant specifications from phonemes: if a --~ ~r  isa P-rule and a is a subset of a phoneme B ~  then theelement ~r  is removed from B.
Instead of removing theelement ~r  from B, thus removing the feature r a l tog~he~a common practice in linguistics is to leave the featurer in B but to change its specif ication into a blank (orzero).
It is stressed very much in the literature(e.g.
~23 ,p.410) that this blank is not a specification20like + or -.
This circumstance has been underl ined byintroduction of the notion of dist inctness of phonemes(or phonemic matrices) - see \[2J ,p.408.
Two phonemes Band C of ~ are called distinct if and only if there isat least one feature f E~ such that B is in f specif iedas + and C as - (or vice versa); conversely, B and C aresaid to be not distinct if and only if for every f~either the specif icat ion of f in B is identical to thatin C or one of both specif ications is blank.
There hasbeen some discussion about this concept of dist inctnesse.g.
\ [2\]  ,p.408 f.) and it has been argued that it (seeis not completely sensible; for the present, however,we will accept it as existing and turn to the quest ion"When do phonological matrices remain distinct after theintroduction of blanks?
".As before, we consider only the case of singlephonemes.
Fully specif ied phonemes are, of course,distinct but they do not necessari ly remain so after theintroduction of blanks.
Taking tab.1 and its P-rules,e.g.
(5), as an example the three rules +has~st r id , -cont ,+vo iced~ - the right hand sides have beencombined for abbreviat ion - applied to /m/ leave thephonemic set ~+nas~ or, using the symbol 0, the set~str id ,+nas,Ocont ,Ovoiced~ whereas the two rules+cont --~ ~+str id,-nas~ applied to /f/ leave ~+cont,-voiced} or ~0str id ,Onas,+cont , -vo iced~ which is notdistinct from the result for /m/?It is possible, however, to have the phonemes o f~pairwise distinct after the introduction of blanks if(as already in Sec.4) an ordering of the features isintroduced and if of all the P-rules derivable from aprime implicant of ~ only the single one with the2~feature of highest rank on the right hand side ischosen:Theorem 3Let the features of ~ be totally ordered by anordering relat ion ~ (i.e.
for f,g ~ ~ either f~g org~!
and let rj ~r  for all rj occurring within the lefthand side a of a P_rule a - -~r .
Then the phonemes ofare pairwise distinct after introduction of blanks.Proof:Let B and C be two (fully specified) phonemes of~ ,  B~0.
Then there is a certain number offeatures of ~ (at least one) such that B isspecif ied contrary to C in exactly these"dist inguishing" features and identical to C inthe remaining features.
Let f be that of thedist inguishing features with the lowest rank.Then there is no P-rule a - -~f  which is appli-cable to both B and C: by assumption all thefeatures in a are of lower rank than f, thus Band C coincide in all features of a.
Since therule is assumed to be applicable to both B and C,a is a subset of both B and C, and since B and Cdif fer in f the set a U~f3  is a subset of e i th~B or C, whatever , .
Thus this set is not animplieant of ~ and, therefore!
a - -~f  cannot bea P-rule.
This means that no blank can occur onf in B and C, i.e.
B and C remain distinct evenafter the introduction of blanks.Without ordering of the features two phonemes canbecome not dist inct as is shown by the examples above.Ordering of the features is, however, only suff icient22for pairwise dist inctness, not necessary, i.e.
a set ofphonemes with blanks can remain pairwise dist inct evenwithout ordering of the features.
For an example takethe set~ +nas- -~,s t r id ,  -str id--~-cont,  +str id-~ +cont,(ll) L+c?nt - -~-nas '  +nas -~+vo icedof P-rules for tab.1.
(One P-rule has been chosen foreach of the prime implicants of eq.(4)).
This set is notcomDatible with any ordering of the features since itwould require nas(s t r id ,  s t r id~ cont and cont~ naswhich is impossible.
Appl ied to tab.1 in the order givenin eq.

Uniqueness.The result of tab.3 depends on the order in (ll) ofthe P-rules.The same P-rules, applied in the order~ -str id--~-cont, +nas--~-str id, +cont--~ -nas,(12) L+st r id - -~+c?nt '  +nas--~+voicedgive tab.4 which is different from tab.3.23str id 0 + +has - .

0 - ?11~ ther  words,  the phonemes with blanks (or, for hl-rules, the matr ices  conta in ing  blanks) are not un ique lydetermined  by the P - ru les  alone but also by the order inwh ich  the P - ru les  are appl ied to put in blanks.This s i tuat ion  can be descr ibed as fo l lows:Let  PI = a - -~r  wi th  a =~i r l , .

.
,~krk~ be a P - ru lewh ich  is app l i cab le  to a phoneme Bg~ , i.e.
a is asubset  of B. P1 can then be used to put a b lank on r inB.
This is, however ,  imposs ib le  if there is a l ready  ab lank in B on one of the features  of a because then ais no longer  a subset  of B.
This b lank on a feature  r iof a ( l~i@k) can be caused only by a P - ru le  P2 =b - -~ i r  i wh ich  was appl ied before PI" Thus the posi -t ion of b lanks  can - and indeed somet imes does, as theexamples  show - depend on the order  of app l i ca t ion  ofthe P-ru les .This order  dependence  somewhat  compl icates  thes i tuat ion  and one can look  for  ways to avoid it.
One wayis to give up the submatr ix  c r i te r ion  for ru le appl i -ca t ion  and to use the non-d is t inc tness  c r i te r ion  instead.Then, the b lank  on r i in B would lear@ a not d is t inc tf rom B, and P1 wou ld  remain  app l icab le .
A ser ious draw-back of this so lu t ion  is, however,  that a b lank does nottel l  wh ich  of the spec i f i ca t ions  + and - has been re-moved by it.
Thus, P1 would be app l i cab le  also to aphoneme B w i th  a b lank on r i wh ich  in its ful l  fo rm has24specif ied as~i  instead of ~i" Thus the non-d~st inct -  r iness cr iterion alone is useless for rule applieation~ itmust be amended by criteria ensuring the correct speci-f icat ion of B on r i.
!There is, however, uniqueness even if we use thesubmstrix cr iterion for rule appl icat ion if the featuresare, as before, total ly ordered and only the special P-rules are chosen.
For this case we have~Theorem ?Let PI = a -~ ~r  with a = ~i r l  , .

,~krk~ andP2 = b - '~ i r i  be two P-rules appl icable to the samephoneme B~B .
Let rj<r and s<r i for each s occurringin b.
Then there is a further P-rule P5 = z - -~rapplicable to B such that r i does not occur in ~zoProof:The P-rules PI and \[?2 are derived from the primeimpl i cants  ql = a U~r \ ]  and q2 = bu la i r i~  o f~.Since P1 and P2 are both applicable to B both aand b are subsets of B; this means, in particular,that a and b are identical ly specif ied in featu-res common to both.
Thus, a Ub  is a phonemic setand a subset of B.
Let c = aX\ [~ i r i~  and letho=C ubv~r \ ]  ; since f<r for all features foccurr ing in c or in b!.
h o is a phonemic set~, i\!,.~,,,~h e is an implieant of 7~ : the feature ~'.j.

If h o is not prime thenthere is a proper subset h I of h o such that h I isan implioant of ~ .
Since each subset of z o is asubset of B necessar i ly ~r  E h l, i.e.h I = Z lU~r  I with Z lCS  o.
If h I is prime thenP3 = Z l - -~r  is the requiredMP-rule; if not thenthere is an implicant h 2 of ~ with h 2Ch I and,similar as before, h 2 = z 2 u~r~ with z 2 ~ z 1.Thus we get a sequence of implicants h~ ofwith h i = z iU~ ~ and z i~z i _  1 C ?..
~z  o = bvc .If one of the h i i s prime then the sequenceterminates with the i~-rule P3 = h i - *~r"  Sincethe z i become smaller and smaller the sequenceterminates in any case with h = z ~ a n dz = ~t~ , ~  , t~ ,  and h is prime sincezcz  o ~ B and ~r~ Cq l  and ql is prime, thusthere is a C~ such that ~r~CC.Thus, even if the blank on r in B cannot be putthere by P1 because it is "blocked" by P2 there is al-ways P3 which cannot be blocked by P2 and which puts theblank on r in B.
Thus, the posit ion of blanks in thephonemes of ~ is uniquely determined by the P-rulesalone independent of the order in which they are applied.Z6Literature.~\ ]  R.JAKOBSON and ~.HALLE: Fundamentals ofLanguage.
