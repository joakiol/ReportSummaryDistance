We report on several experiments on persons?
pages fromWikipedia in order to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed methods.1 IntroductionTemporal information, like dates, durations, time stamps etc., is crucial for organising both structured andunstructured data.
Recent developments in the natural language community show an increased interestin systems that can extract temporal information from text and associate it to other concepts and events.The main aim is to detect and represent the temporal flow of events narrated in a text.
For example, theTempEval challenge series (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013) provideda number of tasks that have resulted in several temporal information extraction systems that can reliablyextract complex temporal expressions from various document types (UzZaman and Allen, 2010; Llorenset al., 2010; Bethard, 2013; Filannino et al., 2013).In this paper we investigate the extraction of temporal footprints (Kant et al., 1998): continuous peri-ods on the time-line that temporally define a concept?s existence.
For example, the temporal footprint ofpeople lies between their birth and death, whereas temporal footprint of a business company is a periodbetween its constitution and closing or acquisition (see Figure 1 for examples).
Such information wouldbe useful in supporting several knowledge extraction and discovery tasks.
A question answering system,for example, could spot temporally implausible questions (e.g.
What computer did Galileo Galilei use forhis calculations?
or Where did Blaise Pascal meet Leonardo Da Vinci?
), or re-rank candidate answerswith respect to their temporal plausibility (e.g.
British politicians during the Age of Enlightenment).Similarly, temporal footprints can be used to identify inconsistencies in knowledge bases.Temporal footprints are in some cases easily accessible by querying Linked Data resources (e.g.
DB-Pedia, YAGO or Freebase) (Rula et al., 2014), large collections of data (Talukdar et al., 2012) or bydirectly analysing Wikipedia info-boxes (Nguyen et al., 2007; Etzioni et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Jiand Grishman, 2011; Kuzey and Weikum, 2012).
However, the research question we want to address inthis paper is whether it is possible to automatically approximate the temporal footprint of a concept onlyby analysing its encyclopaedic description rather than using such conveniently structured information.This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes our approach and four different strategies topredict temporal footprints.
Section 3 provides information about how we collected the data for theexperiments, and Section 4 presents and illustrates the results.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The approach has three steps: (1) extractingmentions of temporal expressions, (2) filtering outliers from the obtained probability mass function ofthese mentions, and (3) fitting a normal distribution to this function.
This process is controlled by threeparameters we introduce and describe below.
We restrict temporal footprints to the granularity of years.2.1 Temporal expression extraction (TEE)For each concept we extract all the dates from its associated textual content (e.g.
a Wikipedia page).There are numerous ways to extract mentions of dates, but we use (a) regular expressions that searchfor mentions of full years (e.g.
sequence of four digits that start with ?1?
or ?2?
(e.g.
1990, 1067 or2014) ?
we refer to this as TEE RegEx; (b) a more sophisticated temporal expression extraction system,which can also extract implicit date references, such as ?a year after?
or ?in the same period?, alongwith the explicit ones and, for this reason, would presumably be able to extract more dates.
As temporalexpression extraction system we used HeidelTime (Str?otgen et al., 2013), the top-ranked in TempEval-3challenge (UzZaman et al., 2013).
We refer to this approach as TEE Heidel.2.2 Filtering (Flt)We assume that the list of all extracted years gives a probability mass function.
We first filter outliers outfrom it using the Median Absolute Deviation (Hampel, 1974; Leys et al., 2013) with a parameter (?)
thatcontrols the size of the acceptance region for the outlier filter.
This parameter is particularly importantto filter out present and future references, invariably present in encyclopaedic descriptions.
For example,in the sentence ?Volta also studied what we now call electrical capacitance?, the word now would beresolved to ?2014?
by temporal expression extraction systems, but it should be discarded as an outlierwhen discovering of Volta?s temporal footprint.2.3 Fitting normal distribution (FND)A normal distribution is then fitted on the filtered probability mass function.
Lower and upper bounds fora temporal footprint are predicted according to two supplementary parameters, ?
and ?.
More specifi-cally, the ?
parameter controls the width of the normal distribution by resizing the width of the Gaussianbell.
The ?
parameter controls the displacement (shift) of the normal distribution.
For example, in thecase of Wikipedia pages about people, typically this parameter has a negative value (e.g.
-5 or -10 years)since the early years of life are rarely mentioned in an encyclopaedic description.
We compute the upperand lower bounds of a temporal footprint using the formula (?+ ?)?
?
?.We experimented with the following settings:(a) The TEE RegEx strategy consists of extracting all possible dates by using the regular expressionpreviously mentioned and by assigning to the lower and upper bound the earliest and the latestextracted year respectively.8(a) Distribution of Wikipedia pages per century.
(b) Distribution of Wikipedia pages per length (in words).Figure 2: Exploratory statistics about the test set extracted from DBpedia.
(b) In the TEE RegEx + Flt approach, we first discard outliers from the extracted dates and then theearliest and latest dates are used for lower and upper bounds.
(c) For the TEE RegEx + Flt + FND strategy, we use the regular expression-based extraction methodand then apply filtering and Gaussian fitting.
(d) Finally, for the TEE Heidel + Flt + FND setting, we use HeidelTime to extract dates from theassociated articles.
We than apply filtering and Gaussian fitting.The parameters ?, ?
and ?
are optimised according to a Mean Distance Error (MDE) specificallytailored for temporal intervals (see Appendix A), which intuitively represents the percentage of overlapbetween the predicted intervals and the gold ones.
For each approach we optimised the parameters ?, ?and ?
by using an exhaustive GRID search on a randomly selected subset of 220 people.3 DataWe applied the methodology on people?s Wikipedia pages with the aim of measuring the performanceof the proposed approaches.
We define a person?s temporal footprint as the time between their birth anddeath.
This data has been selected in virtue of the availability of a vast amount of samples along withtheir curated lower and upper bounds, which are available through DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007).
DBpediawas used to obtain a list of Wikipedia web pages about people born since 1000 AD along with their birthand death dates1.
We checked the consistency of dates using some simple heuristics (the death date doesnot precede the birth date, a person age cannot be greater than 120 years) and discarded the incongruousentries.
We collected 228,824 people who lived from 1000 to 2014.
The Figure 2a shows the distributionof people according to the centuries, by considering people belonging to a particular century if they wereborn in it.As input to our method, we used associated web pages with some sections discarded, typically con-taining temporal references invariably pointing to the present, such as External links, See also, Citations,Footnotes, Notes, References, Further reading, Sources, Contents and Bibliography.
The majority ofpages contains from 100 to 500 words (see Figure 2b).4 ResultsFigure 3 depicts the application of the proposed method to the Galileo Galilei?s Wikipedia article.
Theaggregated results with respect to the MDE are showed in Table 1.
The TEE Reg + Flt setting outperformsthe other approaches.
Still, the approaches that use the Gaussian fitting have lower standard deviation.These results in Table 1 do not take into account the unbalance in the data due to the length of pages(the aggregate numbers are heavily unbalanced towards short pages i.e.
those with less than 500 words,as depicted in Figure 2b).
We therefore analysed the results with respect to the page length (see Figure4).
TEE RegEx method?s performance is negatively affected by the length of the articles.
The longer1We used the data set Persondata and Links-To-Wikipedia-Article from DBpedia 3.9 (http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads39)9Figure 3: Graphical representation of the output on Galileo Galilei?s Wikipedia page.
Vertical contin-uous lines represent the prediction of temporal footprint boundaries, whereas dotted lines represent thereal date of birth and death of the Italian scientist.
The histogram shows the frequency of mentions ofparticular years in Galilei?s Wikipedia page.

This is expected as longer articles are more likely tocontain references to the past or future history, whereas in a short article the dates explicitly mentioned areoften birth and death only.
The use of the filter (TEE RegEx+Flt) generally improves the performance.The approaches that use the Gaussian fitting provide better results in case of longer texts.
Still, inspite of its simplicity, the particular regular expression used in this experiment proved to be effective onWikipedia pages and consequently an exceptionally difficult baseline to beat.
Although counter-intuitive,TEE RegEx + Flt + FND performs slightly better than the HeidelTime-based method, suggesting thatcomplex temporal information extraction systems do not bring much of useful mentions.
This is in partdue to the English Wikipedia?s Manual of Style2which explicitly discourages authors from using implicittemporal expressions (e.g.
now, soon, currently, three years later) or abbreviations (e.g.
?90, eighties or17th century).
Due to this bias, we expect a more positive contribution from using a temporal expressionextraction system, when the methodology is applied on texts written without style constraints.5 ConclusionsIn this paper we introduced a method to extract temporal footprints of concepts based on mining theirtextual encyclopaedic description.
The proposed methodology uses temporal expression extraction tech-niques, outlier filtering and Gaussian fitting.
Our evaluation on people in Wikipedia showed encouragingresults.
We found that the use of a sophisticated temporal expression extraction system shows its strengthonly for long textual descriptions, whereas a simple regular expression-based approach performs betterwith short texts (the vast majority in Wikipedia pages).The notion of temporal footprint has not to be interpreted strictly.
A more factual interpretationof temporal footprint could be explored, such as temporal projection of a person?s impact in his-tory.
This would allow to distinguish between people that made important contribution for the fu-ture history from those who did not.
The predicted interval of Anna Frank?s Wikipedia page is an2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Chronological_items10Figure 4: Observed error of the four proposed approaches with respect to the length of Wikipedia pages(the lower the better).
Each data point represents the average of each bin.
The TEE RegEx settinggenerally provide a very high error which is correlated with the page?s length.
The use of the outlierfilter sensibly improves the performance (TEE RegEx + Flt).
The approach TEE RegEx + Flt + FND isbetter than TEE Heidel + Flt + FND especially with short and medium size pages.

[B] =[AL?
BU, AU?
BL] (where the subscriptsLandUindicate lower and upper bound respectively).Unfortunately, this operation is not appropriate to define error measures, because it does not faithfullyrepresent the concept of deviation (Palumbo and Lauro, 2003).We therefore rely on distances for intervals, which objectively measure the dissimilarity between anobserved interval and its forecast (Arroyo and Mat?e, 2006).
In particular, we used De Carvalho?s distance(De Carvalho, 1996):dDC([A], [B]) =d?IY([A], [B])w([A] ?
[B]),where w([A] ?
[B]) denotes the width of the union interval, and d?IY([A], [B]) denotes the Ichino-Yaguchi?s distance defined as follows:d?IY([A], [B]) = w([A] ?
[B])?
w([A] ?
[B]) + ?
(2w([A] ?
[B])?
w([A])?
w([B])).The Mean Distance Error (MDE) based on De Carvalho?s distance is defined by:MDE =1nn?t=1d?=0IY([At], [Bt])w([At] ?
[Bt])=1nn?t=1w([At] ?
[Bt])?
w([At] ?
[Bt])w([At] ?
[Bt]),11where n is the number of total samples.
We set ?
= 0 because we do not want to control the effects ofthe inner-side nearness and the outer-side nearness between the intervals.The absence of any intersection between the intervals leads to the maximum error, regardless to thedistance between the two intervals.
A predicted interval far from the gold one has the same error of apredicted interval very close to the gold one, if they both not even minimally overlap with it.ReferencesJavier Arroyo and Carlos Mat?e.
