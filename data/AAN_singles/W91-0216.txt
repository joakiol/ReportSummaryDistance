eduAbstractThis paper argues that it is impossible to separate lexical and encyclopedic knowledgeand describes an attempt to build a large lexical database that contains the range ofinformation needed to make a parser or a text generation system interpret and usewords and phrases correctly.1 Int roduct ionAny natural anguage processing system needs both knowledge about words and knowl-edge about he world.
Many natural language systems divide these two kinds of knowledgeinto two knowledge bases, which we call the lexicon and the encyclopedia for the purposesof this discussion.
We argue that the distinction between the lexicon and the encyclo-pedia is difficult to maintain both in theory and in practice.
We describe the designand development ofa large lexical database intended to support parsing, generation, andinformation retrieval applications.
We claim that these applications require informationof many different kinds, some of which is traditionally stored in a dictionary, some in athesaurus, and some in an encyclopedia.We need to support not just alphabetic access to this information but access throughsemantic links.
Bierman \[1964\] was one of the first to describe lexical-semantic l nksbetween words.
They define the basic organization of semantic information, he claims.He paints an image of a very large single-page dictionary with language-specific nodesconnected by semantic relations.Can we distinguish between the lexicon and the encyclopedia in this context?
Bierwischand Kiefer \[1970\] assume that both kinds of information are contained in the same lexicalentry.
The distinction between linguistic or lexical and encyclopedic knowledge, they say,corresponds to the difference between the core and the periphery of a lexical entry, where:The core of a lexical reading comprises all and only those semantic spec-ifications that determine, roughly speaking, its place within the system ofdictionary entries, i.e., delimit it from other (non-synonymous) entries.
Theperiphery consists of those semantic specifications which could be removedfrom its reading without changing its relation to other lexical readings withinthe same grammar.
\[Bierwisch and Kiefer 1970, 69-70\]The major difficulty with this criterion is its instability.
As new entries are added tothe system, information sufficient o distinguish one entry from another may have to be179shifted from the periphery to the core - and thus from the encyclopedia to the lexicon.For instance, suppose a new entry, "leopard - a large wild cat" is to be added.
The entirelexicon must be searched for entries that mention large wild cats.
If one is found, say"lion - a large wild cat," then enough information must be added to both definitions todifferentiate l opard and lion from each other.Apresyan, Mel'~uk, and Zolkovsky run into the same difficulty of distinguishing lexiealand encyclopedic nformation i  attempting to define the lexical universe of a word CO.The main themes dealt with under the heading 'lexical universe' are: 1) thetypes of CO; 2) the main part or phases of CO; 3) typical situations occurringbefore and after CO, etc.
Thus, the section lexical universe for the word skisconsists of a list of the types of skis (racing, mountain, jumping, hunting), theirmain parts (skis proper and bindings), the main objects and actions necessaryfor the correct use (exploitation) ofskis (poles, grease, to wax), the main typesof activities connected with skis (a ski-trip, a ski-race ...) ... the sectionscontain only such words as are necessary for talking on the topic, and nothingelse.
\[Apresyan et al 1970\]The problem is that "what is needed for talking about the topic" depends very muchon who is going to do the talking.
The definition of ski in Webster's New International(2nd edition) begins:One of a pair of narrow strips of wood, metal, or plastic, usually in com-bination, bound one on each foot and used for gliding over a snow-coveredsurface.Apresyan et al do not provide for three of the items mentioned here: what skisare made of (wood, plastic, or metal), what shape they come in (long and narrow) andwhere they belong spatially (on the human foot).
Yet these items could be essential tounderstanding implicit inferences in a story.It was snowing.
Jim took out his skis and the can of wax.
He began towax the wood carefully.
Then he looked for the poles.It could be needed to answer questions:Jim skied rapidly down the mountain.Question: What was Jim wearing?slippers skis sandalsAlthough in English and Russian it is possible to refer to skis without knowing thatthey are long and narrow it is not possible in Navajo or certain African languages wherephysical shapes determine verb forms.
While the entry in Webster's New Internationalgoes on at length beyond the sentence given above, it does not include all the items thatApresyan mentions.
Clearly the boundaries of the lexical universe are not well defined.The dichotomy between the lexicon and the encyclopedia s particularly hard to pre-serve during the updating process.
Recognizing definitions phrased in ordinary Englishis difficult \[Bierwisch and Kiefer, 1970\].
This information does not come neatly packagedand marked "for the lexicon" and "for the encyclopedia".
How do we tell which is which?180Addition of information to one part of the entry may necessitate updating other partsof the entry.
For example, if we learn that record is a verb as well as a noun we needto add morphological information and describe the relation between record and erase.We should probably describe recording materials, as well.
We also need to add thatthe verb record is a factive, i.e., the assertion that someone records an action impliesthe assertion that the action really occurreed.
Which of this information is lexical andwhich is encyclopedic?
Both theoretical and practical arguments convince us that thelexicon-encyclopedia ichtomy is not valid.Information about semantic relationships between words - thesaurus information - isneeded for many reasons.
It is crucial to semantic access.
Hirst and Morris \[1990\] haveshown that it is fundamental to language understanding.
Fox \[1980, 1988\], Nutter et al\[1988\] and Wang et al \[1985\] have used thesaurus information to improve the results of aninformation retrieval system.
Eiler \[1979\] has shown the importance oflexical relationshipsin human text generation.
Lee \[1991\] is using this kind of information to generate cohesivetext by machine.
Zhang \[1990\] is using it to generate xplanations.We need to store all this information not just for words but for phrases.
Becker \[1975\]argues cogently that language is ordinarily generated in large swatches, not a word at atime.
Commercial dictionaries include many phrasal entries.
For example, approximately160~ of the main entries in Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary are phrases and manyother phrases appear as "runons" at the foot of other entries.
Charniak \[1972\] makes itclear that "birthday party" needs an entry of its own - and shows also that its lexicaluniverse is huge.2 Organization of the Lexical DatabaseBecause we want to see our lexicon used by as many people as possible, we have soughtsources for our data that will permit us to distribute the database to anyone who plansto use for research purposes.
Collins Publishers has generously agreed we may give acopy of our lexicon including data derived from the first edition of the Collins EnglishDictionary (CED) to anyone who qualifies to obtain a machine-readable copy from theData Collection Initiative.
Another valuable source of lexical data is the Brandeis VerbLexicon constructed by Grimshaw and Jackendoff \[1985\].
Sven Jacobson \[1964, 1978\] haskindly allowed us to keyboard and distribute his Dictionary of Adverb Placement.
Wehave also put into machine readable form the Adjective, Adverb, Noun, and Verb Listsdeveloped from Householder's NSF project of twenty-five years ago \[1964, 1965\].Our lexical database is organized and stored using the Oracle Relational DatabaseManagement System.
Our database relations (which we will call tables to distinguishthem from semantic relations) include a main table with the word, and its homographand sense number (from the CED) combined into one field, the part of speech, and thesource.
Each word with a different homograph and sense number (assigned in CED) isput into a different entry for the purpose of lexical disambiguation.
Words that have nohomograph or sense number in CED are assigned a code of-1.
We have also designedseparate tables for each part of speech.
Each table contains different information specificto that part of speech.The noun table contains information about whether a noun is regular or irregular,abstract or concrete, count or mass, human, animate or inanimate, singular or plural,common or proper, collective or not, what gender it is, and whether it appears in an181Indiana noun list.
We have a separate table for Indiana nouns (those that support thatclauses) giving the number of the Indiana list \[Bridgeman 1965\].
Then there is still anothertable that gives the definition and an example for each Indiana noun list.
We also have aseparate table for nouns with irregular plurals, like child, goose, and oz.There are a number of different verb tables.
The main verb table tells whether a verbis regular or irregular, dynamic or stative, transitive or intransitive (or both), takes asentential complement or not, can be put into passive voice or not.
If it is in a speech actclass \[Wierzbicka, 1989\] or a performative class \[McCawley, 1979\] then the class will begiven.
Then there is a table for strong verbs with their forms.
There is a case table givinginformation about verb arguments.
If a verb takes sentential complements i  appears in aspecial table that tells what complementizers the verb takes, its implicative class (factive,etc.
), whether it is subject o raising, and whether it appears in an Indiana verb list.
TheIndiana verb table gives Indiana verb classes in which the verb appears.
There is yetanother table that gives the defining information for the Indiana verb lists.The adjective table indicates whether the adjective is dynamic or stative, gradable ornon-gradable, inherent or non-inherent.
An adjective may be intensitive.
It may appearas a post-determiner.
It may be a general adjective susceptible to subjective measure,a general adjective susceptible to objective measure including size or shape, or color.It may be a denominal adjective denoting material, or a denominal adjective denotingprovenance or style.
Information about the semantic lasses an adjective belongs to isessential to determining its position in the sentence during text generation.
While mostadjectives can occur in both attributive and predicate positions, some are non-attributive,others are non-predicative.
We also have a table for unpredictable adjective inflectionsand another for Indiana adjectives \[Householder et al 1965\].
Our adverb tables have beenfully discussed elsewhere \[Pin-Ngern et al 1990\].We also have a table listing lexical-semantic relations with definitions and examplesand then several tables of lexical- semantic relationships \[Ahlswede and Evens, 1988a\].Our plans include tables containing other information from CED such as definitions,pronunciations, and etymologies, but these have not been built since none of us is currentlyusing that information.3 Entries for PhrasesWe have been concerned for several years with the design of entries for phrases; it seemsapparent that we need to record the same kind of information for phrases as for single wordentries and that they are involved in the same lexical relations as other words and morebesides \[Markowitz et al 1988; Ahlswede t al.
1988\].
Li and Markowitz are concentratingon questions about phrasal verbs.
Problems about the kinds of constructions that theseverbs take part in have often been discussed in the literature but not resolved.
Markowitzhas devised several series of examples that we are trying out on every passerby whohappens to be a native speaker of English.
The data collected so far is chaotic; it suggeststhat the explanations in the literature are over-simplified.
CED contains many thousandsof phrasal main entries and many more phrases appear as runons in other entries.
Weare trying to design programs to translate these phrasal entries into entries in the lexicaldatabase.1824 Arguments for VerbsInformation about appropriate arguments for verbs is an obvious need.
We are buildinga table that indicates for each sense of the verb what cases it takes, how those cases aresyntactically realized (as subject, object, or object of a preposition), whether it is obligaoryor  not, and what are the selection restrictions on the fillers of those case slots.
JoanneDardaine wrote a program to build skeleton entries for the verbs in the Brandeis VerbLexicon \[Grimshaw and Jackendoff, 1985\].
Then we sit around and argue about additionalexamples, beginning with verbs that we are using in text generation i a tutoring systemfor cardiovascular physiology \[Zhang et hi.
1990\] and in an explanation subsystem for anexpert system for stroke \[Lee and Evens 1991\].
Grimshaw's new book \[1990\] on argumentpatterns has been of the greatest help.
Given the theoretical disagreements betweenFillmore \[1970\], Bresnan \[1982\], and Grimshaw \[1990\], it is not possible to come up withan ideal solution.
When in doubt we try to make the finest distinctions we can, in thebelief that it will be easier for others to clump our categories together than to divide themfurther.Clearly much of what we are doing for verbs needs to be done for adjectives andadverbs.
Much of the necessary research for adverbs has been carried out by House-holder's group \[1965\] and by Sven Jacobson and published in very detailed and usefulforms \[1964, 1978\].
Jacobson has generously given permission for us "to include this workin our database.
Sumali Pin-Ngern Conlon is using the superb computing facilities of theUniversity of Mississippi, where she is now a faculty member, to put this material intomachine readable form and to combine it with the information from the Indiana AdverbLists \[Householder t hi.
1965\].
We are trying to locate and understand more of theresearch on adjectives such as the work of Ljung at Goteborg, before we start to enhanceour adjective tables appropriately.5 Sentential ComplementsWe have split off the problem of sentential complements from other arguments for verbsbecause we wanted to store this information i separate database tables and because thereare there are separate rich sources of information.
Yu-Fen Huang has entered the verbsfrom Wierzbicka's list of speech act verbs.
We are trying to find out if CED synonyms ofspeech act verbs are also speech act verbs and if they sometimes fit into the same speechact classes \[Wierzbicka 1989\] or performative classes, using McCawley's \[1979\] categories.Pin-Ngern wrote a program to put Indiana Verb List verbs \[Alexander and Kunz 1964;Bridgeman et hi.
1965\] into tables in the database.
Huang is rewriting that program toinclude further information and trying to correlate Wierzbicka's \[1989\] speech act verbsand the Indiana verbs with their CED homograph and sense numbers.6 Sublanguage InformationCED contains quite a lot of information about sublanguage and register (e.g., entries begin"a legal term for" or "a slang name for").
We are trying to figure out how and where tocapture this information so that we can study it more effectively and also so that we canfigure out to use it to make appropriate subsets of the lexical database.183Of course, sublanguage affects the syntactic orrelates of words as well as the lexicalones.
It is clear that we need to relate syntactic information in the lexical database to agiven sense and homographic number.We are designing tools to help us deliver subsets of the database to potential users.Clearly we need to be able to make subsets on the basis of sublanguage information aswell as from word lists given us by people who want data to match.
We expect to makethis kind of data available in fiat files (unless the user has an Oracle Relational DatabaseManagement System).
All the attributes currently recorded in the database are alsodefined in the database.
Any user of the database will be provided with this information.We expect that most of these users will need add to information to the data that we givethem.
So far our lexical data acquisition tools function mainly as SQL forms \[Evens et al1989\].
We need to provide flat file versions of these tools.7 Tools for Accessing and Building the DatabaseWe a re designing two families of tools, one for building the database and one for accessingit.
Database construction tools themselves fall into three categories.
One group of toolsis intended to collect information from human informants to make it easy to add materialto the lexicon for some special purpose or to extend existing information.
For example,we have a tool to examine synonyms of verbs on the Indiana Verb Lists that also takesentential complements and add them to the correct lists \[Evens et aL 1989\].
Anothergroup of tools is intended to take explicit information from a source and put it into theright table or tables.
The third group of tools, most of which were originally built forsublanguage study, is designed to tackle text, sometimes dictionary definitions, sometimesother text, and extract information from it.
These tools make lists of words and phrasesand count them and parse text.
Frank Rinaldo has built most of these tools and is workingon bigger and better ones.Our Oracle database xpert, Robert Strutz, is working on tools to access the database.These tools extract information to be used by a parser or a text generation program.
Othertools in this category check the database for missing data and make reports.
One toolmakes a list of nouns that appear in subsidiary noun tables but not in the main nountable, for example.
Still other tools make subsets of the database for different kinds ofuser specifications.8 Current ApplicationsA small subset of the lexical database, the stroke lexicon \[Ahlswede and Evens, 1988b\],is being used in experiments in information retrieval and text generation.
Wang et aL\[1989\] are using thesaurus information to enhance queries in an interactive informationretrieval system, which operates as a separate PC program and carries out searches of thestroke literature ither independently or in support of an expert system.
Lee and Evens\[1991\] are using the stroke lexicon to generate xplanations for an expert system for stroke.Information about lexical-semantic relations is used in an experiment to make that textcohesive; other lexical information is used to support the basic generation process.1849 SummaryWe are trying to build a big lexical database that contains detailed information about allits entries.
We argue in support of this enterprise that much information often classifiedas encyclopedic is needed by natural language processing programs trying to carry outtasks in parsing, generation, and information retrieval.
In particular, the need for the-saurus information (information about lexical and semantic relationships between words)is becoming increasingly clear.
We are convinced that phrasal entries need informationthat is at least as rich and detailed as that provided for individual words.We are trying to make this lexicon usable by many different people for many differenttasks, with the goal of providing it free to anyone who can use it.
This means that we mustbuild it out of pieces that are readily available to the research community, that we mustbe able to provide subsets of many different kinds, and that we must provide tools so thatothers can access these files and add to them whatever further entries and informationthey need for particular applications.References\[1\] T.
