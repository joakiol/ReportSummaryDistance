A GRAMMAR AND A LEXICONFOR A TEXT-PRODUCTION SYSTEMChristian M.I.M.
MatthiessenUSC/Information Sciences InstituteABSTRACTIn a text-produqtion system high and special demands are placed on thegrammar and the lexicon.
This paper will view these comDonents insuch a system (overview in section 1).
First, the subcomponente dealingwith semantic information and with syntactic information will bepresented se!
:arataly (section 2).
The probtems of relating these twotypes of information are then identified (section 3).
Finally, strategiesdesigned to meet the problems are proDose?l and discussed (section 4).One of the issues that will be illustrated is what happens when asystemic linguistic approach is combined with a Kt..ONE like knowledgerepresentation ?
a novel and hitherto unexplored combination\]1.
THE PLACE OF A GRAMMAR AND ALEXICON IN PENMANThis gaper will view a grammar and a lexicon as integral parts of a textproduction system (PENMAN).
This perspective leads to certainrecluirements on the form of the grammar and that of the eubparts of thelexicon and on the strategies for integrating these components witheach other and with other parts of the system.
In the course of theI~resentstion of the componentS, the subcomDonents and theintegrating strategies, these requirements will be addressed.
Here I willgive a brief overview of the system.PENMAN is a successor tO KDS (\[12\], \[14\] and \[13\]) and is beingcreated to produce muiti.sentential natural English text, It has as someof its componentS a knowledge domain, encoded in a KL.ONE likerepresentation, a reader model, a text-planner, a lexicon, end aSentence generator (called NIGEL).
The grammar used in NIGEL is aSystemic Grammar of English of the type develol:~d by Michael Halliday?
- see below for references.For present DurOoses the grammar, the lexic,n and their environmentcan be represented as shown in Figure 1.The lines enclose setS; the boxes are the linguistic compenents.
Thedotted lines represent parts that have been develoDed independently ofthe I~'esent project, but which are being implemented, refined andrevised, and the continuous lines represent components whose designill being developed within the project.The box labeled syntax stands for syntactic information, both of thegeneral kind that iS needed to generate structures (the grammar;, the leftpart of the box) and of the more Sl~=cific kind that is needed for thesyntactic definition of lexical items (the syntactic subentry of lexicalitems; to the right in the box -- the term lexicogrammar can also be uasdto denote both ends of the box).1Thitl reBe?rcti web SUOl~fled by the Air Force Office of Scientific Re~lllrrJ1 contractNO.

speech acts stc, .- and the semantics ofpresentation -- theme structure, the distinction between given and newinformation etc.).
It is shown as one part of what is called conceDtuals ..our general conceptual organization of the world around us and ourown inner world; it is the linguistic part o!
conceptuals.
For the lexiconthis means that lexical semantics is that part of conceptuals which hasbecome laxicalized and thus enters into the structure of the vocabulary.There is also a correlation between conceptual organization and theorganization of part of the grammar.The double arrow between the two boxes represents the mapping(realization or encoding) of semantics into syntax.
For example, theconcept SELL is mapped onto the verb sold?The grammar is the general Dart of the syntactic box, the partconcerned with syntactic structures.

It has beenimplemented in NIGEL, the santo nee generator mentioned above.
It hasbeen tested and is currently being revised and extended.
None of theother components (those demarcated by continuous lines) have beenimplemented; they have been tested only by way of hand examples.This groat will concentrate on the design features of the grammarrather than on the results of the implementation and testing of it.2.
THE COMPONENTS2.1.
Knowledge representat ion and semanticsThe knowledge representationOne of the fundamental properties of the KL-ONE like knowledgerepresentation (KR) is its intensional -- extensional distinction, thedistinction between a general conceptual taxonomy and a second partof the representation where we find individuals which can exist, statesof affairs which may be true etc.
This is roughly a disbnction t:~ltweenwhat is conceptuaiizaDle and actual conceptualizations (whether theyare real or hypothetical).
In the overview figure in section 1, the twoare together called conceptuals.For instance, to use an example I will be using throughout his paper,there is an inteflsional concept SELL, about which no existence'D orlocation in time is claimed.
An intenalonal concept is related toextensional concede by the relation Inclividuates: intenaionai SELL isrelated by individual instances of extensional SELLs by the Individuatesrelation.
If I know that Joan sold Arthur ice-cream in the I~!rk, I have sSELL fixed in time which is part of an assertion about Joan and itIndiviluates intenaional SELL.
4 A concept has internal structure: it is aconfiguration of roles.
The concept SELL has an internal ~ r ewhich is the three roles associated with it, viz.
AGENT (the seller),RECIPIENT (the buyer) and OBJECT.
These rolee are slot3 which arefilled by other concepts and the domains over which these can very aredefined as value restrictions.
The AGENT of SELL is a PERSON or aFRANCHISE and sO on.tn ~,ther words, a ?oncel~t is defined by its relation to other concepts(much aS in European structuraiism).
These relations are rolesa'~sociated with the concept, roles whose fillers are other concept?This gives rise to a large conceptual net.There is another reiation which helps define the place of a conoe=t inthe conceptual net.
viz.
SuperCategory, which gives the conceptual neta taxonomic (or hierarchic) structure in addition to the structure definedby the role relations.
The concept SELL ie defined by its I~lace in thetaxonomy by having TRANSACTION as a SuperCate<jory.
If we want to,4It ~toul?l be eml)t~ullz41~t ~t l t  r.~lltng the cof~-.eot SELL 'u=y~l nothing wt'~lt=oe~t~r li~out~ngli~tt exl~'qm~on for it:.

As a result, p)art of the taxonomy of events isTRANSACTION --- SELL .-- SELLOB.If TRANSACTION has a set of roles associated with it, this set may beinherited by SELL and by SELLOB .- this is a generaJ feature of theSuperCategory relation.
In the examples involving SELL that follow, Iwill concentrate on this concept and not try to generalize to itssupercategones.The Semantic SubentryIn the overview figure (1.1), the semantics is shown as part of theconcaptuais- The consequence of this is that the set of semanticentries in the lexicon is a subset of the set of concepts.
The subset isgroper if we assume that there are concepts which have not beenlexicaiized (the assumption indicated in the figure).
The a.csumption isI~erfectJy reasonable; I have already invented the concept SELLOB forwhich there is no word in standard English: it is not surprising if we haveformed concepts for which we have to create expressions rather thanpick them reedy.made from our lexicon.
Furthermore, if we construct aconceptual component intended to support say a bilingual speaker,there will be a number of concepts which are lexicaiized in only one ofthe two languages..A semantic entry, than, is a concept in the conceptuais- For sold, wefind soi l  wiffi its associated roles, AGENT, RECIPIENT and OBJECT.The right ~ of figure 4.1 below (marked "se:'; after a figure from \[1\]gives a more detailed semantic ent~ for sold: = pointer identifies therelevant part in the KR, the concept that constitutes the semantic entry(here the concept SELL).The concept that constitutes the semantic entry of a lexicai item has afairly rich structure.
Roles are associated "with the concept and themodailty (neces~ury or optional), the ?ardinaii~ of and restrictions on(value of) the fillers are given.Through the value restriction the linguistic notion of selectionrestriction is captured.
The stone sold a carnation to the little girl is oddbecause the AGENT role of SELL is value restricted to PERSON orFRANCHISE and the concept associated with stone fails into neithertype.The strategy of letting semantic entries be part of the knowledgerepresentation would not have been possible in a notation designed tocsgture specific propositions only, However, since KL-ONE pfovilesthe distinction between intension and extension, the strategy isunl=rotolsmati?
in the I=resant framework.So what is the relationship between intensional-extensionai ands~manti?
entries?
The working aesumption is that for a large part of the"vocaioulary, it is the concepts of the intanalonai part of the KR that maybe lexicalized and thus serve as semantic entries.
We have words forintenalonai obje?=, actions and states, but not for indtviluaiextensional obiects etc.
with the exception of propel names.
They haveextensional concepts as their semantic entries.
For instance, Alexdenotes a particular individuated person and The War of the Roses apalrticula?
individumed war.Both the Sul~H'Category relation and the Indiviluates relation provideways of walking around in the KR to find expresmons for concepts.
If50we are in the extensional part of the KR, looking at a particularindividual, w~ can follow the Individuates link up to an intensionalconcept.
There may be a word for it, in which case the concept is part ofa laxical entry.
If there is no word for the concept, we will have toconsider the various options the grammar gives us for forming an?oPropriate exoressJon.The general assumption is that all the intensional vocabulary can heused for extensional concepts in the way just describe(l: exc)reasabi..,'yis inherited with the Individuates relation.Expression candidates for concepts can also be located along theSuberCate(Jory link by going from one concept to another one higherup in the taxonomy.
Consider the following example: Joan sold Arthurice.cream.
The transaction took place in tl~e perk.
The SuperCate~orylink enables us to go from SELL to TRANSACTION, where we find theexpression transaction.Lexical Semantic RelationsThe structure of the vocabulary is parasitic on the conceptual structure.In other words, laxicalized concepts are related not only to one another,but also to concepts for which there is no word,encoding in English (i.e.non-laxicalized concepts).Crudely, the semantic structure of the lexicon can be described asbeing part of the hierarchy of intensional concepts -- the intensionalconcepts that happen to be lexicalized in English.
-- The structure ofEnglish vocabulary is thus not the only principle that is reflected in theknowledge representation, but it is reflected.
Very general conceptslike OBJECT, THING and ACTION are at the top.
In this hierarchy, rolesare inherited.
This corresponds to the semantic redundancy rules of alexicon.Considering the possibility of walking around in the KR and theintegration of texicalized and non.iexicalized concepts, the KR suggestsitself as the natural place to state certain text-forming principles, someof which have been described under the terms lexical cohesion (\[8\])and Thematic Progression (\[6\]).I will now turn to the syntactic component in figure 1-1, starting with abrief introduction to the framework (Systemic Linguistics) that does thesame for that component as the notion of semantic net did for thecomponent just discussed.2,2.
LexicogrammarSystemic Linguistic~ stems from a British tradition and has beendeveloped by its founder, Michael Halliday (e.g.
\[7\], \[9\], \[10\]) andother systemic linguists (see e.g.
\[5\], \[4\] for S presentation of Fawcett'sinteresting work on developing a systemic model within a cognitivemodel) for over twenty years covering many areas of linguistic concern,including studies of text, ;exicogrammar, language development, andcomputational applications.
Systemic Grammar was used in SHRDLU\[15\] and more recently in another important contribution, Davey'aPROTEUS \[3\].The systemic tradition recognizes a fundamental principle in theorganization of language: the distinction between cl~oice and thestructures that express (realize) choices.
Choice is taken as primaryand is given special recC,;\]nition in the formalization of the systemicmodel of language.
Consequently, a description is a specification of thechoices a speaker can make together with statement:; about how herealizes a selection he has made.
This realization of a set of choices istypically linear, e.g.
a string of words.
Each choice point is formalized asa ,system (hence the name Systemic).
The options open to the speakerare two or more features that constitute alternatives which can' bechosen.
The preconditions for the choice are entry conciitiona to thesystem.
Entry conditions are logical expressions whose elementaryterms are features.All but one of the systems have non.emt~/ entry conditions.
Thiscauses an interdependency among the systems with the result that thegrammar of English forms one network of systems, which cluster whena feature in one system is (part of) the entry condition to anothersystem.
This dependency gives the network depth: it starts (at its"root") with very general choices.
Other systems of choice depend onthem (i.e.
have a feature from one of these systems -- or st combinationof features from more than one system .. as entry conditions) so that thesystems of choice become less general (more delicate to use the,systemic term) as we move along in the network.The network of systems is where the control of the grammar resides, itsnon.deterministic part.
Systemic grammar thus contrasts with manyother formalisms in that choice is given explicit representation and iscaptured in a single ruis type (systems), not distributed over thegrammar as e.g.
optional rules of different types.
This property ofsystemic grammar makes it s very useful component in atext-production system, seDecially in the interf3ce with semantics and inensuring accessibility of alternatives.The rest of the grammar is deterministic .. the consequences offeatures chosen in the network of systems.
These conse(luences areformalized as feature realization statements whose task is to build theappropriate structure.For example, in independent indicative sentences, English offers achoice between declarative and interroaative sentences, ifinterrooativ~ is chosen, this leeds to a dependent system with a choicebetween wh-intsrrooative and ves/no-interroaative.
When the latter ischosen, it is realized by having ~.he FINITE verb before the SUBJECT.Since it is the general design of the grammar that is the focus ofattention, I will not go through the algorithm for generating a sentenceas it has been implemented in NIGEL.
The general observation is thatthe results are very encouraging, although it is incomplete.
Thealgorithm generates a wide range of English structures correctly.
Therehave not been any serious problems in implementing a grammar writtenin the systemic notation.Before turning to the lexico, part of lexicogrammar, I will give anexample of the toplevel structure of a sentence generated by thegrammar.

.In the park| Join / sold | Arthur 14ce-?reem51The structure consists of three layers of function symbols, aJl of whichare needed to get the result desired.. .
The structure is not onlyfunctional (with- function s/m/ools laloeling the const|tuents instead ofcategory names like Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase) but i t  ismultifunctional.Each layer of function symbols shows a particular perspective on theclause structure.
Layer \[1\] gives the aspect of the sentence as arepresentation of our experience.
The second layer structures thesentence as interaction between the speaker and the hearer;, the factthat SUBJECT precedes FINITE signals that.the speaker is giving thehearer information.
Layer \[3\] represents a structuring of the clause as amessage; the THEME is its starting point.
The functions are calledexperiential, inte~emonal and textual resm~-~Jvety in the systemicframework: the function symbols are said to belong to three differentmetafunctions, in the rest of the !~koar I will concentrate on theexperiential metafunction, I=artiy because it will turn out to be highlyrelevant o the lexicon.The syntactic sut3entry.In the systemic tradition, the syntactic part of the lexicon is seen as acontinuation of grammar (hence the term lexicogrammar for both ofthem): lsxical choices are simply more detailed (delicate) thangrammatical choices (cf.
\[9\]).
The vocabulary of English can be seenas one huge taxonomy, with Roget's Thesaurus as a very rough model.A taxonomic organization of the relevant Dart of the vocabulary ofEnglish is intended for PENMAN, but this Organization is part of theconceptual organization mentioned al0ove.
There is st present noseparate lexicai taxonomy.The syntactic subentry potentially con~sts of two parts.
There is alv~yethe class specification .. the lexical features.
This is a statement of thegrammatical potential of the lexicai item, i.e.
of how it can be usedgrammatically.
For sold the'ctas,~ specification is the following:verbC'/I1~ |0c~als 02bemlf &ct, 1rewhere "benefactive" says that sold can occur in a sentence with aBENEFICIARY, "class 10" that it encodes a material p r~(contrasting with mental, varbai and relational processes) and "CMas02" that  it is a tnmaltive verb.In ~ldition, there is a provision for a configurationai part, which is ah'agment of a Structure the grammar can generate, more specifically theexperiential part of the grammar, s The structure corresponds to the toplayer ( # \[1\]) in the example above.
In reference to this example, I canmake more explicit wh~ I mean by fragment.
The general point is that(to take just one cimm as an example) the presence and cf lara~er offunctions like ACTOR, BENEFICIARY and GOAL .- diract t:~'ticiplmts inthe event denoted by the verb .- depend on the type of verb, whereasthe more circumstantial functions like LOCATION remain unaffectedand a~oDlical=ie to all ~ of verb.
Conse(luently, the information aboutthe poasibilib/ of having a LOCATION constituent is not the type ofinformation that has to be stated for specific lsxical items.
Theinformation given for them concerns only a fragment of the experientialfunctional structure.The full syntactic entry for sol~ is:PROCESS ?
vetoc lass  IOclass 02bef lo f l c t lveACTOR ?GOAL8EX(FICZAR?
"This says that sold Can occur in a fragment of a struCtUre where it isPROCESS and there can be an ACTOR, a GOAL and a RENEF1CIARY.The usefulness of the structure fragment will be demonstrated insection 4.3.
THE PROBLEMI will now turn to the fundamental proiolem of making a working s/stemout of the parts that have been discu~md.The problem ~ two parts to it.
viz.1.
the design of the system as a system with int.egrated Dartsand2.
the implementation of the system.I will only be concerned with the 6rat aspect here.The components of the system have been presented.
What remains -.and that is the problem -- is to dealgn the misalng \[inks; tO find thestrategies that will do the job of connecting the components.Finding these strategies is a design problem in the following sense.
ThestnUegies do not come as accessories with the frameworks we haveuasd (the systemic framework and the KL-ONE inspired knowledgereprasentatJon).
Moreover, th~me two frameworks stem from two quitedispm'ate traditions with different sets of goals, symbols and terms.I will state the problem for the grammar first and then for the lexicon.
Asit has been presented, the grammar runs wik:l and free.
It is organizedMound choice, to be sure, but there is nothing to relate the choices tothe rest of the Wstem, in particular to what we can take to be semantics.In other word~k although the grammar may have ?
~ that faces~emantics .. the system network, which; in Hallldly'e worcls, is~arnantically relevant grammar .- it does not mmke direct contact withsemantics.
And, if we know what we want the system to ante>de in asentence, how can we indicate what goes where, that is what aconstituent (e.9.
the ACTOR) should encocle?The lexicon incorporates the problem of finding an ?opropriate strategyto link the components to each other, since it cuts acrosa componentboundn,des.
The semantic and s/ntsctic subpaJts of a lexica| entryhave been outlined, but nothing hall been sak:l about how they shouldbe matched up with one ,.,nother.
The reason why this match is not~rfect ly straightforward has to do with the fact that both entries may besa'uctunm (conf,~urations) rather than s~ngle elements.
In sedition,there are lexical relations that have not been accounted for yet,es~lcially synonymy and polysemy.5Th~ conllgursb(mld ~ dQ~ not mira from the sylmm~ tn~libon, i~t  is In.~m m me 17mont ckm~524.
LOOKING FOR THE SOLUTIONS4.1.
The GrammarChoice experts and their domains.The control of the grammar resides in the n.etwork of systems.
Choiceexperts can be developed to handle the choices in these systems.The idea is that there is an expert for each system in the network andthat this expert knows what it takes to make a meaningful choice, whatthe factors influencing its choice are.
it has at its disposal a table whichtells it how to find the relevant pieces of information, which aresomewhere in the knowledge domain, the text plan or the reader model.In other words, the part of the grammar that is related to Semantics isthe part where the notion of choice is: the choice experts know aboutthe Semantic consequences of the various choices in the grammar anddo the job of relating syntcx tO semantics, sThe recognition of different functional componenta of the grammarrelates to the multi-funCtional character of a structure in systemicgrimmer I mentioned in relsUon to the example In the park Joan soldArthur ice.cream in section 2.2.
The organization of the sentence intoPROCESS, ACTOR, BENEFICIARY, GOAL, and LOCATIVE is anorganization the grammar impeses on our experience, and it is theaspect of the organization of the Sentence that relates to the conceptualorganization of the knowledge domain: it is in terms of this organization(and not e.g.
SUBJECT, OBJECT, THEME and NEW INFORMATION)that the mapping between syntax and semlmtic,,i can be stated... Thefunctional diver~ty Hailiday has provided for systemic grammar isuseful in a text.production .slrstam; the other functJone find uses whichspace does note permit a discuesion of here.Pointers from cJonslituents.In order for the choice experts to be able to work, they must knowwhere to look.
Resume that we are working on in the park in ourexample Sentence in the park Joan sold Arthur ice.cream and that anexpert has to decide whether park should be definite or not.
Theinformation about the status in the mind of the reader of the conceptcorre~oonding to park in this sentence is located at this conce~t: the~ck  is to ~mociats the concept with the constituent being built.
In theexample structure given earlier, in the park is both LOCATION andTHEME, only the former of which is relevant o the present problem.
Thesolution is to set a pointer to the relevant extensional concept when thefunction symbol LOCATION is inserted, so that LOCATION will carry thepointer and thus make the information attached to the concept8ccaesible.4.2.
The lexicon and the lexlcal entryI have already inb-oducad the semantic subentry and the syntactic?
ubentry.
They are stated in a KL-ONE like representation and asystemic notation respec~vely.
The queslion now is how to relate thetwo.In the knowledge representation the internal struc~Jre of a concept is aconfiguration of roles and these roles lead to new concepts to which theconcept is related.
A syntactic structure is seen as a configuration ofaA ~ d~lnitk~n ot the h~i soTintlca ol tt~ gnlmm?r i k  I s  ?

For example, the function ACTOR leads to a part of thenetwork whoSe entry feature is Nominal Group just ~s the role AGENT(of SELL) leads to the concept that is the filler of it.
The parallel betweenthe two representations in this area are the following:KRONLEDG\[ REPRESENTATIOM SYNTACTIC REPRES\[MTATIONro le  fu f lc t tonf 111el" exponent(Where exponent denotes the entry feature into a pm't of the network(e.g.
Nominal Group) that the function leads to.
)This parallel clears the path for a strmegy for relating the Semantic entryand the syntactic entry.
The strategy is in keeping with current ideas inlinguistics.
"r Consider the following crude entry for sold, given here a.san illustration:Subentl , les:I i?~ent~?

BEMEFICIAR?where the previously discussed semantic and syntactic subentries arerepeated and paired off against each other.This full lexical entry makes clear the usefulness of the second part ofthe syntactic entry .. the fragment of the experiential functionalstructure in which sold can be the PROCESS.Another piece of the total picture siso falls into place now.
The notion ofa pointer from an experiential function like BENEFICIARY in thegrammatical structure to a point in the conceptual net was introducedabove.
We can now see how this pointer may be Set for individual exicalitems: it is introduced as a simple relation between a grammaticalfunction symbol and s conceptual role in the iexical entry of e.g.
SELL.Since there is an Indlviduates link between this intensionai concept andany extensional SELL the extensional concept that is part of theparticular proposition that is being encoded grarnmaticaJly, the pointeris inherited and will point to a role in the extensional part of theknowledge domain.At this point, I will refer again to the figure below, whose dght half I havealready referred to as a full example of a semantic subentry ("see").
"sp:" is the spelling or orthographi c subentry; "gee" is the syntactics,,bentry.We have two configurations in the lexical ent~'y: in the Semanticsubentry the concept plus a number of roles and in the syntacticsubentry a number of grammaticsi functions.

I  \ \FIgure 4-1: Lexicalentry for soldin the first step I introduced the KL-ONE like knowledge representationAll three roles of SELL have the modaJity "r~c~___,~_~'.
This does notdictate the grammatical pos.~bilities.
The grammar in Nigei offers achoice between e.g.
They sold many books to their customers and Thebook sold well, In the second example, the grammar only Dicks out asubset of the roles of SELL for expras~on.
In other words, the grammarmakes the adoption of different persl~?tives possible.
II I can nowreturn to the ol:~ervation that the functional diversity Hallidey hasprovldat for systemic grammar is useful for our pu~__o'-'e~-__; The fact thatgrammatical structure is multi.layered means that those aspects ofgrammatical structure that are relevant to the mapping between the twolexical entries are identified, made explicit (as ACTOR BENEFICIARYetc.)
and kept seperate from pdnciplas of grernmatical structuring thatare not directly relevant to this mapl:dng (e.g.
SUBJECT, NEW andTHEME).In conclusion, a stretegy for accounting for synonymy and polysemycan be mentioned.The way to cagture synonymy is to allow a concept to be the semanticsubentry for two distinct orthographic entries.
If the items aresyntactically identical as well.
they will also share a syntactic subentry.Polyeemy works the other way:.
there may be more than one concept forthe same syntactic subentry.5.
CONCLUSIONI have discus.s~l a gremmm" and a lexicon for PENMAN in two steps.F~rst I looked at them a~ independent components -- the semantic entry,the grammar and the syntactic entry -- and then, after identifying theproblems of integrating them into a system, I tumed to strategies forre!sting the grammar to the conceptual representation and the syntacticentry to the semantic one within the lexicon.and the systemic notation and indicated how their design features canbe Out to good use in PENMAN.
For instance, the distinction betweenintension and exten*on in the knowledge representation makes itI~OS.~ble to let iexical semantic~ be part of the conceptuals.
It was alsosuggested that the relations SuberC.,at~gory and Indivlduates can beto find expre~-~ions for a particular concept.The second steO attempted to connect the grammar to semanticsthrough the notion of the choice expel,  making use of a designprinciple of systemic grammars where the notion of choice is taken asba~c.
I pointed out the correlation between the structure of a conceptand the notion of structure in the systemic framework and allowed howthe two can be matched in a lexical entry and in the generation of asentence, a slrstegy that could be adopted because of themultl.funotional nature of structure in systemic grammars.
This secondstep has been at the same time an attempt to start exploring thepotential of a combination of a KL-ONE like representation and aSy~emic Grammar.Although many ~%oects have had to be left out of the discussion, thereare s number of issues that are of linguistic interest and significance.The most basic one is perhal~ the task itself:, designing ?
model wherea grammar and a lexicon can actually be mate to function as more thanjust structure generators.
One issue reiatat to this that has beenbrought uD was that different ~ external to the grammar findresonance in different I=ari~ of the grammar and that there is a partialcorrelation between tim conceptual structure of the knowleclgereOresentation and the grammar and lexicon.AS was empha.~zacl in the introduction, PENMAN is at the design stage:there is a working sentence generator, but the other 8.qDect~ of whathas been di$cut~tecl have not been imDlement~l and there is nocommitment yet to a frozen design.
Naturally, a large number ofproblems still await their solution, even at the level of design and,cleerly, many of them will have to wait.

Hopefully, ideas such asgrammars organized around choice and cl~oice experts will ;)roveuseful tools in working out extensions.REFERENCESBrachman, Roneld, A Structural Paradigm for RepresentingKnowledge, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc., Technical Report,1978.3.4.5.6.Bresnan, J., "Polyadicity: Part I of s Theory of LexicaJ Rules andRepresentation," in Hoekstra, van dar Hulst & Moortgat (eds.
