M. van I toof (FhG-IAO,Stuttgart,FRG)INTRODUCTION.In our contribution for COLING 88 (1III '88), weintroduced the concept of dialogical failure in theframework of dialogue games, by defining rules forthe operator F, where FA is to be interpreted as"A is not winnable in this stage of the dialogue".We showed that F can be employed in the formu-lation of provisional implications.
Provisional im-plications can be considered as the dialogicalinterpretation of defaults.It was shown that oursolution works well for a range of examples.
Weconcluded our paper with the announcement of atreatment of counteffactuals in terms of dialogicalfailure and of an implemented theorernprover forconditionals and counteffactuals based on our the-oretical developments.In this note we will brieflydescribe the considerations: leading to our treatmentof counteffactuals and introduce the implementa-tion of a theoremprover for conditionals as a sub-system of PROLOG.
For a more detaileddescription of the formal properties of the systemwe refer to (ttli.91).I.
A DOUBLE CIIANGE OFLOGICAL ROLES1.
If it were the case that A,then it would be the case that Cis usually called a counteffactual, because itsantecedent is pretended not to have tile truth-valueit "rcally" has.
Tichy (T.84) shows that none of theprominent theories on counteffactuals is successfullon all members of a set of mostly very plausibletesteases, and wonders why it is, that in settling thevalidity of a counterctual, nobody ever refers tosuch matters as world similarity and other wellknown paraphernalia of traditional counteffactualtheory.
We take seriously Tichy's suggestion tolook for the use of counteffactuals and formulatea semantics for counteffactuals not in terms of"troth" and "falsehood", but rather in terms of whatis done and not done in a dialogue in which acounterfactual ppears.
One thing which simply isqmt done" when discussing a eounterfactual is thefollowing: Suppose you forward the thesis "ifkangaroos had no tails, they would topple over"(I.73) to somebody who has already admitted thatkangaroos do have tails.
Suppose your adversaryaccepts the invitation to discuss, and takes theantecedent of the counterfactual s a temporaryadditional concession.
Then it would be com-pletely out of order Ibr you to claim to have wonthe the discussion on the ground that your adver-sary has now "contradicted" himself.tlowever, ifcontradicting oneself - as an opponent - in a dis-cussion is no longer a reason for losing that dis-cussion, then we seem to be playing according toroles which are similar to those for minimal calcu-lus.
Define negation as implication of some absurdstatement, eg.
a contradiction, "%":2 .
- 'A= A-> %In intuitionistic and in classical logic the proponentwho utters the absurd statement loses against anythesis whatsoever.
Not so in minimal calculus: herethe opponent, having uttered the absurd, loses onlyif he, in a later move, attacks the absurd broughtforward by the proponent.
However, count-effaetuals cannot simply be treated as implicationsin minimal calculus: Suppose Jones steps on thebrake (B), and is "alive (A), and that is all we assumeor admit.
We will not accept he counteffactual "IfJones would not step on the brake, then he wouldnot be alive" as winnable (i.e.
holding) under thesecircumstances.
But in minimal calculus we have3.
A ,B?
- -B -> -~A = yesminSuppose we add to tile concessions A and B aconcession to the effect that stepping on tile brakeis the only reason for Jones' being alive (--, B ->-, A) .
Now we will not want the counteffactual "IfJones would not step on tile brake, then he wouldbe alive" ( -1 B - > A ) to be whmable.
But it is,since in minimal calculus we have4.

Wctherelbre need two things: a treatment of negationwhich is even weaker than that of minimalcalculus,and the introduction of an opportuuity forthe opponent  to make us(" of his own conccssiot~sas exception rules+ The second of these is easilyetlk'ctuated: by inlroducing flK+ fail- operator twicewe cause a first change of rolcs which gives the op-ponent, tmw as a ternporary proponent, the op+portunity to britlg additional concessions into play,The second fail operator then restores the initialorder of roles.
