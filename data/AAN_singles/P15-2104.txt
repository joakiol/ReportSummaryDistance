nodes toincrease location homophily and boosttractability; and (2) the incorporationof text-based geolocation priors for testusers.
Experiments over three Twitterbenchmark datasets achieve state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate the effective-ness of the enhancements.1 IntroductionGeolocation of social media users is essentialin applications ranging from rapid disaster re-sponse (Earle et al., 2010; Ashktorab et al.,2014; Morstatter et al., 2013a) and opinion anal-ysis (Mostafa, 2013; Kirilenko and Stepchenkova,2014), to recommender systems (Noulas et al.,2012; Schedl and Schnitzer, 2014).
Social mediaplatforms like Twitter provide support for users todeclare their location manually in their text pro-file or automatically with GPS-based geotagging.However, the text-based profile locations are noisyand only 1?3% of tweets are geotagged (Cheng etal., 2010; Morstatter et al., 2013b), meaning thatgeolocation needs to be inferred from other infor-mation sources such as the tweet text and networkrelationships.User geolocation is the task of inferring the pri-mary (or ?home?)
location of a user from avail-able sources of information, such as text postedby that individual, or network relationships withother individuals (Han et al., 2014).
Geolocationmodels are usually trained on the small set of userswhose location is known (e.g.
through GPS-basedgeotagging), and other users are geolocated usingthe resulting model.
These models broadly fallinto two categories: text-based and network-basedmethods.
Orthogonally, the geolocation task canbe viewed as a regression task over real-valuedgeographical coordinates, or a classification taskover discretised region-based locations.Most previous research on user geolocationhas focused either on text-based classificationapproaches (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Wing andBaldridge, 2011; Roller et al., 2012; Han et al.,2014) or, to a lesser extent, network-based regres-sion approaches (Jurgens, 2013; Compton et al.,2014; Rahimi et al., 2015).
Methods which com-bine the two, however, are rare.In this paper, we present our work on Twit-ter user geolocation using both text and net-work information.
Our contributions are as fol-lows: (1) we propose the use of Modified Ad-sorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) as a base-line network-based geolocation model, and showthat it outperforms previous network-based ap-proaches (Jurgens, 2013; Rahimi et al., 2015); (2)we demonstrate that removing ?celebrity?
nodes(nodes with high in-degrees) from the network in-creases geolocation accuracy and dramatically de-creases network edge size; and (3) we integratetext-based geolocation priors into Modified Ad-sorption, and show that our unified geolocationmodel outperforms both text-only and network-only approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art re-sults over three standard datasets.2 Related WorkA recent spike in interest on user geolocation oversocial media data has resulted in the developmentof a range of approaches to automatic geolocationprediction, based on information sources such asthe text of messages, social networks, user pro-file data, and temporal data.
Text-based methodsmodel the geographical bias of language use in so-cial media, and use it to geolocate non-geotaggedusers.
Gazetted expressions (Leidner and Lieber-man, 2011) and geographical names (Quercini et630al., 2010) were used as feature in early work,but were shown to be sparse in coverage.
Hanet al.
(2014) used information-theoretic methodsto automatically extract location-indicative wordsfor location classification.
Wing and Baldridge(2014) reported that discriminative approaches(based on hierarchical classification over adap-tive grids), when optimised properly, are superiorto explicit feature selection.
Cha et al.
(2015)showed that sparse coding can be used to effec-tively learn a latent representation of tweet text touse in user geolocation.
Eisenstein et al.
(2010)and Ahmed et al.
(2013) proposed topic model-based approaches to geolocation, based on the as-sumption that words are generated from hiddentopics and geographical regions.
Similarly, Yuanet al.
(2013) used graphical models to jointly learnspatio-temporal topics for users.
The advantage ofthese generative approaches is that they are able towork with the continuous geographical space di-rectly without any pre-discretisation, but they arealgorithmically complex and don?t scale well tolarger datasets.
Hulden et al.
(2015) used kernel-based methods to smooth linguistic features oververy small grid sizes to alleviate data sparseness.Network-based geolocation models, on theother hand, utilise the fact that social media usersinteract more with people who live nearby.
Ju-rgens (2013) and Compton et al.
(2014) used aTwitter reciprocal mention network, and geolo-cated users based on the geographical coordinatesof their friends, by minimising the weighted dis-tance of a given user to their friends.
For a recip-rocal mention network to be effective, however, ahuge amount of Twitter data is required.
Rahimiet al.
(2015) showed that this assumption couldbe relaxed to use an undirected mention networkfor smaller datasets, and still attain state-of-the-art results.
The greatest shortcoming of network-based models is that they completely fail to ge-olocate users who are not connected to geolocatedcomponents of the graph.
As shown by Rahimi etal.
(2015), geolocation predictions from text canbe used as a backoff for disconnected users, butthere has been little work that has investigated amore integrated text- and network-based approachto user geolocation.3 DataWe evaluate our models over three pre-existinggeotagged Twitter datasets: (1) GEOTEXT (Eisen-stein et al., 2010), (2) TWITTER-US (Roller etal., 2012), and (3) TWITTER-WORLD (Han et al.,2012).
In each dataset, users are represented bya single meta-document, generated by concatenat-ing their tweets.
The datasets are pre-partitionedinto training, development and test sets, and re-built from the original version to include men-tion information.
The first two datasets were con-structed to contain mostly English messages.GEOTEXT consists of tweets from 9.5K users:1895 users are held out for each of developmentand test data.
The primary location of each user isset to the coordinates of their first tweet.TWITTER-US consists of 449K users, of which10K users are held out for each of developmentand test data.
The primary location of each useris, once again, set to the coordinates of their firsttweet.TWITTER-WORLD consists of 1.3M users, ofwhich 10000 each are held out for developmentand test.
Unlike the other two datasets, the primarylocation of users is mapped to the geographic cen-tre of the city where the majority of their tweetswere posted.4 MethodsWe use label propagation over an @-mentiongraph in our models.
We use k-d tree descre-tised adaptive grids as class labels for users andlearn a label distribution for each user by labelpropagation over the @-mention network usinglabelled nodes as seeds.
For k-d tree discretisa-tion, we set the number of users in each region to50, 2400, 2400 for GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US andTWITTER-WORLD respectively, based on tuningover the development data.Social Network: We used the @-mention infor-mation to build an undirected graph between users.In order to make the inference more tractable,we removed all nodes that were not a memberof the training/test set, and connected all pairingsof training/test users if there was any path be-tween them (including paths through non train-ing/test users).
We call this network a ?collapsednetwork?, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Note that acelebrity node with n mentions connects n(n?
1)nodes in the collapsed network.
We experimentwith both binary and weighted edge (based on thenumber of mentions connecting the given users)networks.631tr1tr2tr3te1te2te3te4te5m1m2@-mention Networkm3tr1tr2tr3te1te2te3te4te5d1d2d3d4d5Collapsed Network plus Dongle Nodestrimiteiditrain nodementioned nodetest nodedongle nodeFigure 1: A collapsed network is built from the @-mention network.
Each mention is shown by adirected arrow, noting that as it is based exclusively on the tweets from the training and test users, itwill always be directed from a training or test user to a mentioned node.
All mentioned nodes which arenot a member of either training or test users are removed and the corresponding training and test users,previously connected through that node, are connected directly by an edge, as indicated by the dashedlines.
Mentioned nodes with more than T unique mentions (celebrities, such as m3) are removed fromthe graph.
To each test node, a dongle node that carries the label from another learner (here, text-basedLR) is added in MADCEL-B-LR and MADCEL-W-LR.Baseline: Our baseline geolocation model(?MAD-B?)
is formulated as label propagationover a binary collapsed network, based on Modi-fied Adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009).
Itapplies to a graph G = (V,E,W ) where V is theset of nodes with |V | = n = nl+ nu(where nlnodes are labelled and nunodes are unlabelled),E is the set of edges, and W is an edge weightmatrix.
Assume C is the set of labels where|C| = m is the total number of labels.
Y is ann?m matrix storing the training node labels, and?Y is the estimated label distribution for the nodes.The goal is to estimate?Y for all nodes (includingtraining nodes) so that the following objectivefunction is minimised:C(?Y ) =?l[?1(Yl??Yl)TS(Yl?
?Yl)+?2?YTlL?Yl]where ?1and ?2are hyperparameters;1L is theLaplacian of an undirected graph derived fromG; and S is a diagonal binary matrix indicatingif a node is labelled or not.
The first term ofthe equation forces the labelled nodes to keeptheir label (prior term), while the second termpulls a node?s label toward that of its neighbours1In the base formulation of MAD-B, there is also a regu-larisation term with weight ?3, but in all our experiments, wefound that the best results were achieved over developmentdata with ?3= 0, i.e.
with no regularisation; the term is thusomitted from our description.
(smoothness term).
For the first term, the labelconfidence for training and test users is set to 1.0and 0.0, respectively.
Based on the developmentdata, we set ?1and ?2to 1.0 and 0.1, respectively,for all the experiments.
For TWITTER-US andTWITTER-WORLD, the inference was intractablefor the default network, as it was too large.There are two immediate issues with the base-line graph propagation method: (1) it doesn?t scaleto large datasets with high edge counts, related towhich, it tends to be biased by highly-connectednodes; and (2) it can?t predict the geolocation oftest users who aren?t connected to any traininguser (MAD-B returns Unknown, which we rewritewith the centre of the map).
We redress these twoissues as follows.Celebrity Removal To address the first issue,we target ?celebrity?
users, i.e.
highly-mentionedTwitter users.
Edges involving these users oftencarry little or no geolocation information (e.g.
themajority of people who mention Barack Obamadon?t live in Washington D.C.).
Additionally,these users tend to be highly connected to otherusers and generate a disproportionately high num-ber of edges in the graph, leading in large part tothe baseline MAD-B not scaling over large datasetssuch as TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD.We identify and filter out celebrity nodes sim-ply by assuming that a celebrity is mentioned bymore than T users, where T is tuned over develop-ment data.

For TWITTER-WORLDtuning was very resource intensive so T was setto 5 based on GEOTEXT, to make the inferencefaster.
Celebrity removal dramatically reduced theedge count in all three datasets (from 1 ?
109to5 ?
106for TWITTER-US and from 4 ?
1010to1 ?
107for TWITTER-WORLD), and made infer-ence tractable for TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD.
Jurgens et al.
(2015) report that the timecomplexity of most network-based geolocationmethods is O(k2) for each node where k is theaverage number of vertex neighbours.
In the caseof the collapsed network of TWITTER-WORLD, kis decreased by a factor of 4000 after setting thecelebrity threshold T to 5.
We apply celebrityremoval over both binary (?MADCEL-B?)
andweighted (?MADCEL-W?)
networks (using the re-spective T for each dataset).
The effect ofcelebrity removal over the development set ofTWITTER-US is shown in Figure 2 where it dra-matically reduces the graph edge size and simulta-neously leads to an improvement in the mean er-ror.A Unified Geolocation Model To address theissue of disconnected test users, we incorporatetext information into the model by attaching a la-belled dongle node to every test node (Zhu andGhahramani, 2002; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006).2 5 15 50 500 5kCelebrity threshold T (# of mentions)700720740760780800820840860Mean error (in km)Mean errorGraph size 105106107108109Graph size (# edges)Figure 2: Effect of celebrity removal on geoloca-tion performance and graph size.
For each T per-formance is measured over the development set ofTWITTER-US by MADCEL-W.The label for the dongle node is based on a text-based l1regularised logistic regression model, us-ing the method of Rahimi et al.
(2015).
The don-gle nodes with their corresponding label confi-dences are added to the seed set, and are treatedin the same way as other labelled nodes (i.e.the training nodes).
Once again, we experi-ment with text-based labelled dongle nodes overboth binary (?MADCEL-B-LR?)
and weighted(?MADCEL-W-LR?)
networks.6335 EvaluationFollowing Cheng et al.
(2010) and Eisenstein etal.
(2010), we evaluate using the mean and me-dian error (in km) over all test users (?Mean?and ?Median?, resp.
), and also accuracy within161km of the actual location (?Acc@161?).
Notethat higher numbers are better for Acc@161, butlower numbers are better for mean and median er-ror, with a lower bound of 0 and no (theoretical)upper bound.To generate a continuous-valued lati-tude/longitude coordinate for a given userfrom the k-d tree cell, we use the median co-ordinates of all training points in the predictedregion.6 ResultsTable 1 shows the performance of MAD-B,MADCEL-B, MADCEL-W, MADCEL-B-LR andMADCEL-W-LR over the GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD datasets.
The re-sults are also compared with prior work onnetwork-based geolocation using label propaga-tion (LP) (Rahimi et al., 2015), text-based clas-sification models (Han et al., 2012; Wing andBaldridge, 2011; Wing and Baldridge, 2014;Rahimi et al., 2015; Cha et al., 2015), text-based graphical models (Ahmed et al., 2013), andnetwork?text hybrid models (LP-LR) (Rahimi etal., 2015).Our baseline network-based model of MAD-Boutperforms the text-based models and also previ-ous network-based models (Jurgens, 2013; Comp-ton et al., 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015).
The in-ference, however, is intractable for TWITTER-USand TWITTER-WORLD due to the size of the net-work.Celebrity removal in MADCEL-B andMADCEL-W has a positive effect on geoloca-tion accuracy, and results in a 47% reduction inMedian over GEOTEXT.
It also makes graphinference over TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD tractable, and results in superiorAcc@161 and Median, but slightly inferiorMean, compared to the state-of-the-art results ofLR, based on text-based classification (Rahimi etal., 2015).MADCEL-W (weighted graph) outperformsMADCEL-B (binary graph) over the smallerGEOTEXT dataset where it compensates for thesparsity of network information, but doesn?timprove the results for the two larger datasetswhere network information is denser.Adding text to the network-based geolocationmodels in the form of MADCEL-B-LR (binaryedges) and MADCEL-W-LR (weighted edges),we achieve state-of-the-art results over all threedatasets.
The inclusion of text-based priors hasthe greatest impact on Mean, resulting in anadditional 26% and 23% error reduction overTWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD, respec-tively.
The reason for this is that it provides auser-specific geolocation prior for (relatively) dis-connected users.7 Conclusions and Future WorkWe proposed a label propagation method overadaptive grids based on collapsed @-mention net-works using Modified Adsorption, and success-fully supplemented the baseline algorithm by: (a)removing ?celebrity?
nodes (improving the resultsand also making inference more tractable); and (b)incorporating text-based geolocation priors intothe model.As future work, we plan to use temporal dataand also look at improving the text-based geoloca-tion model using sparse coding (Cha et al., 2015).We also plan to investigate more nuanced meth-ods for differentiating between global and localcelebrity nodes, to be able to filter out globalcelebrity nodes but preserve local nodes that canhave high geolocation utility.AcknowledgementsWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their in-sightful comments and valuable suggestions.
