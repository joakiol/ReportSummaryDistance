This demonstration gives an overviewof the UIMA Ruta Workbench, which provides a development environment and tooling for therule language.
It was developed to ease every step in engineering rule-based applications.
In ad-dition to the full-featured rule editor, the user is supported by explanation of the rule execution,introspection in results, automatic validation and rule induction.
Furthermore, the demonstrationcovers the usage and combination of arbitrary components for natural language processing.1 IntroductionComponents for natural language processing and information extraction nowadays often rely on statis-tical methods and their models are trained using machine learning techniques.
However, componentsbased on manually written rules still play an important role in real world applications and especially inindustry (Chiticariu et al., 2013).
The reasons for this are manifold: The necessity for traceable results,the absence or aggravated creation of labeled data, or unclear specifications favor rule-based approaches.When the specification changes, for example, the complete training data potentially needs to be annotatedagain.
In rule-based components, adaptions in a small selection of rules typically suffice.
Rule-based ap-proaches are also used in combination with or when developing statistical components.
While models areoften trained to solve one specific task in an application, the remaining parts need to be implemented aswell.
Furthermore, rules can be applied for high-level feature extraction and for semi-automatic creationof labeled data sets.
It is often faster to define one rule for a specific pattern than to annotate repeatingmentions of a specific type.Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) is a frame-work for analyzing unstructured data and is extensively applied for building natural language processingapplications.
Two popular systems built upon UIMA are the DeepQA system Watson (Ferrucci et al.,2010) and the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) (Savova et al., 2010).UIMA allows the definition of scalable pipelines of interoperable components called analysis engines,which incrementally add and modify meta information of documents mostly in form of annotations.
Thesemantics and features of annotations are given by their types, which are specified in type systems.This demonstration gives an overview on the UIMA Ruta Workbench (Kluegl et al., 2014), a develop-ment environment for the UIMA Ruta language.
The rule language provides a compact representation ofpatterns while still supporting high expressivity necessary for solving arbitrary tasks.
The UIMA RutaWorkbench includes additional tools that accelerate the efficient creation of components and completepipelines.
The user is supported in all aspects of the development process like specification of rules andtype systems, debugging, introspection of the results, and quality assessment.

The rule language and the tooling support are introduced in Section 3.
Section 4 provides anoverview of the content of the demonstration and Section 5 concludes with a summary.2 Related SystemsRule-based systems for information extraction and natural language processing in general have a longhistory and thus we can only give a short comparison to a selection of related systems especially based onUIMA.
The probably most noted rule-based system is JAPE (Cunningham et al., 2000).
It is open sourceand integrated into the GATE (Cunningham et al., 2011) framework.
JAPE propagates a clear separationof condition and action parts, and an aggregated execution of rules of one phase in a finite state transducerwhereas UIMA Ruta allows freer positioning of actions for a more compact representation and appliesthe rules sequentially.
Nevertheless, UIMA Ruta is able to compete well concerning performance andprovides a high expressiveness.
AFST (Boguraev and Neff, 2010) is also based on finite state transduc-tion over annotations and additionally allows vertical patterns, which are also supported in UIMA Ruta.SystemT (Chiticariu et al., 2010) defines rules in declarative statements similar to SQL and applies themusing an optimized operator graph.
Our system takes first steps in this direction with the concept ofvariable matching directions, but still provides a compact language for more flexible operations.
Otherrule-based systems for UIMA are the IBM LanguageWare Resource Workbench2, Zanzibar3and UIMARegexp4.Most of the freely available rule-based systems provide only minimal development support.
Gooddevelopment environments and tooling are usually found in at least partially commercial systems.
Thedevelopment environment of SystemT (Chiticariu et al., 2011), for example, provides an editor withsyntax highlighting and hyperlink navigation, an annotation provenance viewer, a contextual clue dis-coverer, regular expression learner, and a rule refiner.
One intention of UIMA Ruta consists in providingstrong tooling support that facilitates every step in the development process.
The UIMA Ruta Workbenchincludes most features of related systems, but still introduces a few new and useful tools.3 UIMA RutaUIMA Ruta (Rule-based Text Annotation) consists of a rule-based language interpreted by a genericanalysis engine and of the UIMA Ruta Workbench, a development environment with additional tooling.Rules are sequentially applied and are composed of regular expressions of rule elements.
The rule ele-ments typically define the annotation type to be matched and an optional list of conditions and actions.The language provides a variety of diverse elements to elegantly solve arbitrary tasks.
The rule matchingsupports overlapping alternatives and a coverage-based visibility.
The following example illustrates therule syntax:(ANY{INLIST(MonthsList) -> Month} PERIOD?
NUM{REGEXP(".
{2,4}") -> Year}){-> Date};This rule matches on any token present in an external dictionary MonthsList followed by an optionalperiod and a number that contains two to four characters.
If this pattern was recognized, then the actionscreate new annotations of the types Month, Year and Date for the corresponding matched segments.Following this, the rule identifies and annotates dates in the form of ?Dec.
2004?, ?July 85?
or ?11.2008?.Rule scripts can additionally include and apply external components, or specify additional types.
Adetailed description of the UIMA Ruta language can be found in the documentation5.The UIMA Ruta Workbench is an Eclipse-based6development environment for the rule language.A screenshot of the Workbench?s main perspective is depicted in Figure 1.
Rule scripts are organizedin UIMA Ruta projects and take advantage of the well-known features of Eclipse like version control2http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/lrw3https://code.google.com/p/zanzibar/4https://sites.google.com/site/uimaregex/5http://uima.apache.org/d/ruta-current/tools.ruta.book.html6http://www.eclipse.org/30Figure 1: A selection of views in the UIMA Ruta Workbench: (A) Script Explorer with UIMA Rutaprojects.

The full featured editor for writing rules provides most of the characteristics known by ed-itors for programming languages like instant syntax checking, syntactic and semantic highlighting, orcontext-sensitive auto-completion.
An informative explanation of each step of the rule execution ex-tended with profiling information helps to identify unintended behavior of the rules.
The user is able toautomatically evaluate the quality of rules on labeled documents and also on unlabeled documents usingformalized background knowledge.
Furthermore, the tools support pattern-based queries in collectionsof documents, semi-automatic creation of gold standards and different algorithms for supervised ruleinduction.The rule language and the tooling are both extensible.
The rule language can be enhanced with newactions, conditions, functions and even constructs that adapt aspects of the rule execution.
Further func-tionality can be integrated by implementing supplementary analysis engines.
The UIMA Ruta Work-bench straightforwardly supports extensions due to its integration in Eclipse, e.g., new views can beadded for improving specific development processes.
Additional evaluation measures and rule learningalgorithms are directly added by extension points.
The Workbench also supports workspaces where theuser develops interdependent Java and UIMA Ruta analysis engines simultaneously, and it seamlesslyintegrates components from Maven repositories.The UIMA Ruta Workbench has been successfully utilized to develop diverse natural language ap-plications.
These include template-based information extraction in curricula vitae, segmentation ofscientific references, or extraction of characters in novels, but also segmentation, chunking and rela-tion extraction in clinical notes.
Furthermore, the system is applied for feature extraction, creation ofgold standards, and different pre- and post-processing tasks in combination with statistical models.
Theeffectiveness of the Workbench can hardly be measured, but it is highlighted by the fact that severalapplications have been engineered in only a few hours of work.314 Contents of DemonstrationThe demonstration of the system concentrates on the general usage of the UIMA Ruta Workbench andhow to develop rule-based analysis engines with it.
We address the following use cases and aspects:?
General rule engineering: Simple examples are given for common tasks in UIMA Ruta, e.g., howto create new projects and script files, and how an initial set of rules is applied on a collection ofdocuments.
Several examples highlight the expressivity and effectiveness of the rule language.?
Debugging erroneous rules: Manual specification of rules is prone to errors.
We will demonstratethe explanation component of the Workbench that facilitates the traceability of the rule matchingand allows the identification of unintended behavior.?
Definition of type systems and pipelines: The UIMA Ruta language can be applied for textualdefinition of type systems and rule-based pipelines of arbitrary analysis engines, which enablesrapid prototyping without switching tools.?
Introspection of results: The usage of the rule language as query statements allows the user toinvestigate different aspects of documents that have been annotated by arbitrary analysis engines,e.g., also based on statistical methods.?
Quality assessment: The automatic assessment of the analysis engines?
quality is a central aspectin their development process.
We demonstrate test-driven development using gold standard docu-ments, and constraint-driven evaluation for unlabeled documents based on formalized backgroundknowledge.?
Document preprocessing: The UIMA Ruta language can be applied for many tasks in the Work-bench.
These include different preprocessing steps like converting HTML files, anonymization,cutting paragraphs or rule-based document sorting.?
Rule learning: The provided rule induction algorithms based on boundary matching, extractionpatterns and transformations are illustrated for simple examples.?
Extension of the language: Specific projects take advantage of specialized language elements.Extensions of the language and their seamless integration in the Workbench are shown with severalexamples.?
Combinations with Java projects: Some functionality can hardly be specified with rules, evenwith an extended language specification.
Thus, examples provide insights how to make use ofadditional functionality implemented in Java.?
Integration of external analysis engines: Repositories like DKPro (Gurevych et al., 2007) orClearTK (Ogren et al., 2008) provide a rich selection of well-known components for natural lan-guage processing.
We demonstrate how these analysis engines and type systems can easily beintegrated and how the user is able to specify rules based on the their results, e.g., for improving apart-of-speech tagger or for exploiting their annotations for relation extraction.?
Semi-automatic annotation: A semi-automatic process supported by rules can speed up the cre-ation of gold documents.
An exemplary use case will illustrate how the user can efficiently acceptor reject the annotations created by rules.A detailed description of these use cases will be available as part of the documentation of the project.5 ConclusionsThis demonstration presents the UIMA Ruta Workbench, a useful general-purpose tool for the UIMAcommunity.
The system helps to fill the gap of rule-based support in the UIMA ecosystem and is ap-plicable for many different tasks and use cases.
The user is optimally supported during the engineeringprocess and is able to create complex and well-maintained applications as well as rapid prototypes.
TheUIMA Ruta Workbench is up-to-date unique concerning the combination of the provided features andtools, availability as open source, and integration in UIMA.32An interesting option for future work consists in making the functionality of UIMA Ruta and its toolingalso available in web-based systems like the Argo UIMA platform (Rak et al., 2012).AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Competence Network Heart Failure, funded by the German FederalMinistry of Education and Research (BMBF01 EO1004), and is used for information extraction frommedical reports and discharge letters.ReferencesBranimir Boguraev and Mary Neff.
