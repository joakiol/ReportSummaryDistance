Computation of Relative Social Statuson the Basis of Honorification in KoreanDong-Young LeeCentre for Cognitive ScienceUniversity of Edinburgh2 Buccleuch PlaceEdinburgh EH8 9LW, UKdylee@cogsci.ed.ac.ukAbstractThis paper presents a way to compute rela-tive social status of the individuals involvedin Korean dialogue.
Every Korean sentenceindicates whether honorification occurs in it.The occurrence of honorification in a sen-tence is constrained by relative social statusof the individuals involved in the sentence.By using the intbrmation about social statusand the information about sentence-externalindividuals uch as speaker and addressee, wecan explain why a sentence is felicitous in arestricted context and whether a dialogue iscoherent or not.
Since it is possible andeasy to include such contextual intormationin the IfPSG formalism, that formalism isadopted here.
The implementation f Koreandialogue processing and the computation ofsocial status is made based on ALE system.1 PreliminariesIn the conventional approach to honorification inKorcan, attention has becn paid to subject honorifica-tion and a scntencc itself though the Korean honorifi-cation system consists of three types of honorifica-tion (that is, subject honorification, object honorifiea-tion, and addrcssec honorification) and the scntence-external individuals (i.c., speaker and addressce) playan important role in the honorification system.In our approach speaker and addrcssce are specifiedfor cach scutcncc and all thrce types of honorificationarc c(msidcred simnltancously.
In addition the appro-ach uses the inlormation about the sentence-externalindividuals as well as the individuals mentioned in asentence to compute relative social status.
In Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollardand Sag, 1994) the information about speaker andaddressee can be included in a lexical sign and thusthai: grammar formalism is adopted in our approach.This paper shows how to compute relative socialstatus o1' the persons involved in a dialogue which isa series of sentences.
The attempt to compute socialstatus of the individttals involved in a dialogue hasnever been made betbre.
A dialogue processing andthe computatiou of relative social status are imple-inentcd using the system of ALE (Carpenter andPenn, 1995).Knowledge of honorific morphemes in Korean isrequisite to the inference of social status and thus it isexplained in Section 2.
The problem with the previ-ous approach and the reason why a sign-based appro-ach is suitable to the computation of social status arepresented in Section 3.
Section 4 deals with the in-ference of social status in a coherent dialogue and thedetection of an incoherent dialogue.
Section 5 pre-sents the implementation f dialogue parsing and thecomputation of relative social status within the ALEsystem.
Finally in Section 6 the importance of thecontextual information and the advantages of ourapproach ale discussed.2 Morphemes Relevant toHonorificationDepending on who is respected by speaker, the hono-rification type is determined (for example, when asubject referent, an ohject referent, and addressee arehonored by speaker, subject honorification, objecthonorification, and addressee honorification occur, re-spectively).
The linguistic realization of these typesof honorifieation is manifested by specific morphe-mes such as an honorific suffix, honorific case mark-ers, an honorific infix, honorific verbal endings, andhmnble verb forms.
Let us look at them one by one.First, when the honorific suffix him attaches to anNP, the referent of the NP is respected by speaker.Second, if an honorific case marker is used, the ref-erent of the NP to which the honorific case market"attaches is respected by speaker.
Plain (i.e., non-honorific) case market's and honorific case markerscorresponding tothem are as shown in (1).
(1) Case Markers- ~ _  nominative genitiveplain ka, i uyh0nol'ific kkeysedative accusative.
e.ykey .
u.!, hflkkcySince neither an honorific genitive case marker nor anhonorific accusative case marker exists, the referent ofa genitive NP or an accusative NP is respected whenthe genitive NP or the accusative NP contains thehonorific suffix nim.
It is also possible to attachboth the honorific suffix nim and an honorific casemarker to an NP.Third, the honorific infix si appearing in a verbindicates that the referent of a subject NP is respectedby speaker.693Fourth, honorific verbal endings indicate thatspeaker shows honor or courtesy to addressee.
Theplain verbal endings and honorific verbal endings areas illustrated in (2).
(2) a. Declarative Verbal Endingformal informalplain ta e, ahonorific (su)pnita ((y)e)yob.
Interrogative Verbal Endingformal informalplain (nu)nka hi, e, ahonorific (su)pnikka ((y)e)yoThe relationship between speaker and addressee deter-mines whether a formal verbal ending or an informalverbal ending can be used.
For example, when a con-versation is made between friends, an informal verbalending is used.
On the other hand, when a business-man talks to another businessman, a formal verbalending is used.An honorific verbal ending is used when the socialstatus of addressee is higher than that of speaker (inthis case speaker shows honor to addressee) or whenthe social status of speaker is higher than that ofaddressee (in this case speaker shows courtesy toaddressee).
Thus from an honorific verbal ending wecan infer that the social status of speaker and addresseeis not equal.Finally, the use of a humble verb form indicatesthat an object referent is respected by speaker and thatthe social status of an object referent is higher thanthat of a subject referent.3 Background and FrameworkWithout considering the extra-sentential ndividualssuch as speaker and addressee, it is not possible tocompute relative social status of the persons involvedin a sentence.3.1 P rev ious  WorkAll earlier works (Kim, 1988; Kuno and Kim, 1985;Suh, 1978) were done about subject honorification ithe frame of pure syntactic theory.
Their claim isthat there is a syntactic agreement between a subjectNP and its corresponding verb.
In other words, if anhonorific morpheme attaches to a subject NP, the ho-norific infix si must appear in a verb as shown in (3).
(3) Hart sensayng-nim-i o-si-ess-ta.teacher-hon-nom come-hon-past-dec'Teacher Han came.
'As far as subject honorification is concerned, theirassertion is correct.
Their approach, however, is in-complete and cannot be applied to the computation ofsocial status for the following reasons.First, every sentence has a verb.
Addressee honori-fication is indicated in a verb.
Subject honorificationis manifested in a subject NP and a verb.
Thus evenif a sentence itself is looked at, it is necessary to con-sider both addressee honorification and subject honori-fication.Second, the consideration of a sentence itself is notenough because honorification phenomenon is relatedto the sociolinguistic factor such as social status.
Intheir approach, it cannot be explained why the sen-tence in (4) instead of the sentence in (5) must beused when speaker has higher social status than thesubject referent though the two sentences are equallygrammatical.

'(5) Park kwacang-nim-i naka-si-ess-e.chiefsection-hon-nom go out-hon-past-dec'Chief section Park went out.
'Finally, it is not possible to compute social statusat all just by the information that the subject referentwho is mentioned in a sentence is respected.
In thecomputation of social status it is necessary to knowthe binary relation such as the person A is respectedby the person B.
In the honorification system theperson who respects others is always speaker.
Thusin computing social status speaker should be avail-able.
Their approach, however, cannot gain access tospeaker, who is a sentence-external individual becauseonly a sentence itself is considered.3.2 A Sign-Based ApproachIn HPSG which adopts a sign-based approach, theinformation about sentence-external individuals uchas speaker and addressee as well as the informationabout the persons mentioned in a sentence can beincluded in a lexical sign.
The feattn-e structure of alexical sign is as shown in (6).

Ill order to see values theattribute CONTEXT may have, let us consider the sen-tence in (7).

So the LOCAL value of the constituenttowatuli-si-ess-supnikka is s shown in diagram (10).

In addi-tion, it supplies the information that the social statusof speaker is not equal to that of addressee.695As shown in diagrams (8-10), there is no conflict inthe information provided by the attribute CONTEXT.From the information supplied by the attribute S-STATUS we can infer that \[~>\[~\]>l'~l, \[ >\[~\]>l"g'l, and\ [ ~  (where '>' and 'e'  stand for the relation 'higherthan' and 'not equal to', respectively).
Thus the sen-tence in (7) is felicitous in the context where the so-cial status of the object referent is higher than that ofany other individuals involved in the sentence, wherethe social status of the subject referent is higher thanthat of speaker and addressee, and where the socialstatus of speaker is not equal to that of addressee.Within a sentence speaker and addressee do notchange.
This fact iS guaranteed by the ContextualIndices Inheritance Principle shown in (11).
( l l )  Contextual Indices Inheritance Principle:The CONX T C-INDICES value of a given phrase istoken-identical to that of any of its daughters.The information about who honors whom andabout relative social status of the individuals involvedin a sentence is collected at sentence level by theBackground and Social Status Consistency Principlestated in (12).
(12) Background and Social Status ConsistencyPrinciple :The CONX I BACKGR value and the CONX I S-STA-TUS value of a given phrase are the collection ofthe CONX I BACKGR values and the CONX I S-STA-TUS values of all its daughters, respectively.Thus within a sign-based approach it is possible tocompute relative social status on the basis of thecollected relations of social status.
The informationabout relative social status provides the context inwhich a sentence is felicitous.4 Inference of Relative Social StatusRelative social status of the individuals involved in adialogue can be inferred by collecting and computingthe relations of social status collected at sentencelevel.4.1 Template for a Relation of Social StatusWhen a subject referent or an object referent isrespected by speaker, the social status of the subjectreferent or the object referent is higher than that ofboth speaker and addressee as formalized in (13).
(13) Inds/o > Indsp, Inds/o > IndadOn the other hand, if a subject referent or an objectreferent is not respected by speaker, the social statusof speaker is equal to or higher than that of the sub-ject referent or the object referent as shown in (14).
(14) Indsp > Inds/oWhen a humble form of a verb is used in asentence, the social status of an object referent ishigher than that of any other individuals (that is,speaker, addressee, and a subjeCt referent) involved ina sentence as represented in (15).
(15) Ind o > Indsp, Ind o > Indad, Ind o > IndsIf a humble form of a verb is available but is notused, the social status of speaker is equal to or higherthan that of an object referent as illustrated in (16).
(16) Indsp > IndoWhen the honorific infix si occurs in a verb, thesocial status of a subject referent is higher than thatof speaker and addressee as represented in (17).
(17) Inds > Indsp, Inds > IndadIf the honorific infix si does not occur in a verb, thesocial status of speaker is equal to or higher than thatof a subject referent as shown in (l 8).
(18) Indsp > IndsFinally, when an honorific verbal ending is used,the social status of speaker is different from that ofaddressee as illustrated in (19).
(19) Indsp ~ IndadIf a plain verbal ending is used, the social status ofspeaker is equal to or higher than that of addressee asshown in (20).
(20) Indsp > Indad4.2 Inference in a Coherent DialogueBy a coherent dialogue we mean that there is noconflicting inference of social status from the sen-tences occurring in the dialogue.
Let us look at thedialogue shown in (2 l).
(21) a. K-kkeyse hoyuy-eynom (hon) meeting-postpchamsekha-si-ess-eyo.attend-boa-past-dec (hon)'K attended at the meeting.
'(Speaker: S, Addressee: L)b. P-kkeyse K-nim-ul towatuli-si-ess-e.nom (hon) hon-acc help (hum)-hon-past-dec'P helped K.'(Speaker: L, Addressee: S)c. S-nun P-nim-ul poy-ess-ni?top hon-acc meet (hum)-past-int'Did S meet P?
'(Speaker: L, Addressee: S)The above dialogue occurs between the person S andthe person L. In their utterance the person K and theperson P are mentioned.
Let us infer the relative so-cial status of those four persons.
From the sentence(21a) the order in (22) is drawn.
(22) K>S, K>L, S~LSimilarly, the orders shown in (23) and (24) are de-rived from the sentences (21b) and (21c), respectively.
(23) P>L, P>S,K>L, K>S, K>P, L_>S(24) L>S, P>L, P>S696The relative orders illustrated in (22-24) are collapsedinto the one illustrated in (25).
(25) K>P>L>SSo the relative order of social status shown in (25) isderived fi'om the dialogue in (21).4.3 Detection of an Incoherent DialogueIt is possible to recognize whether a sentence in adialogue is consistent with the previous sentence(s)with respect o the honorification of a certain person.Let us consider the dialogue shown in (26).
(26) a. R-kkeyse M-kkeynom (hon) dat (hon)sikyey-lul sensaha-sbess-e.clock-acc present-hon-past-dec'R presemed a clock to M.'(Speaker: Youngsoo, Addressee: Sungmin)b. Heesoo-ka M-ul manna-ss-ni?nora acc meet-past-int'Did Heesoo meet M?
'(Speaker: Sungmin, Addressee: Youngsoo)In the sentence (26a) four persons are involved:Youngsoo, Sungmin, the person R, and the personM.
The order of their relative social status is asillustrated in (27).
(27) R>Youngsoo, R>Sungmin,M>Youngsoo, M>Sungmin,R>M, Yotmgsoo>SungminLikewise, from (26b) we draw the relative ordershown in (28).
(28) Sungmin>Heesoo, Sungmin>M,Heesoo_>M,Sungmin_>YoungsooIt is derived from sentence (26a) that the social statusof M is higher than that of Sungmin as shown in(27), whereas it is derived from (26b) that the socialstatus of M is not higher than that of Sungmin asillustrated in (28).
The latter derivation cannot becompatible with the former derivation.
Thus thedialogue in (26) is not coherent with respect o thehonorit'ication of the person M. This kind of inco-herence can be detected only by considering relativesocial status of the individuals involved in a dialogue.5 Implementat ionTo compute relative social status of the individualsinvolved in a dialogue, the dialogue should be parsedand contextual information about social status mustbe available at dialogue level.5.1 Dialogue ParsingIn ALE the primary predicate for parsing is 'rec'.
Forexample, the query for parsing the sentence in (29)should have the format illustrated in (30).
(29) Soonchul-i Minyoung-ul manna-ss-e.nom ace meet-past-dec'Soonchul met Minyoung.
'(Speaker: Mansoo, Addressee: Chulho)(30) \] ?- ree  \[mansoo, chulho,  soonchu l_ i ,minyoung_ ul, maxma_ss  e \] .As shown in the query, the first member of the inputlist is speaker of the input sentence, the second lnem-ber of the input list is addressee, and the remainingmembers are the constituents of the input sentence.Although the indexes of speaker and addressee arevariables in the entry of lexicons, these variables areinstantiated to speaker and addressee specified in theinput string when a sentence is parsed.A dialogue is composed of sentences.
As a deviceof linking sentences, the conjunctive kuliko 'and' isused.
The conjunctive, however, does not contributeanything to a dialogue.
For instance, the query forparsing the dialogue in (21) is its illustrated in (31).
(31) J ?- rec \[s,l,k kkeyse,hoyuy el.
',chamsekha  si ess eyo ,ku l i ko ,i, s, p_kkeyse ,  k n im_ul ,towatu l i  si es~_e ,ku l i ko ,l , s ,s  nun ,p  n im u l ,poy  ess hi\] .As shown in (31), the conjunctive kuliko is notinserted after the last sentence in a dialogue becauseno further sentence follows.
In query (3l) bothspeaker and addressee arc specified for each sentence.Since a series of sentences forms a dialogue, thefeature structure of a dialoguc is its shown in (32).
(32) VCOMPOSED-OF list of sentence-signsq\]BACKGR set of background l\[2S-STA'rUS set of social s'tatus _\]The value of the feature COMPOSEI)-OF is a list.
Eachmember of the list is the result of parsing eachsentence occurring in a dialogue.
On the other hand,the value of the feature IIACKGP, iS a set.
Eachelement of the set contains the inlormation aboutwho honors whom, which is collected during aparsing of each sentence in a dialogue.
The value ofthe feature S-STATIJS is also a set whose elementsprovide the information about relative social status ofthe persons involved in a dialogue.5.2 Computation of Relative Social StatusAll pieces of information that are necessary for thecomputation of social status are stored in the value ofthe feature S-STATUS.
l.et us consider how relativesocial status is computed using the dialogue in (21).When a dialogue is processed, the inlormation aboutrelative social status is provided in the form of featurestructure.
Feature structures are converted into Prologfacts since the reasoning component comprised ofinference rules accepts Prolog facts, not feature struc-tures.
In the case of dialogue (21), the Prolog factsshown in (33) are obtained.
(33) a. h igher (k , s ) ,  h igher  (k, l) .b.

% Y>Z(37) h igher_ in f _ three  (k,p, i) .
(38) h igher_ in f _ three  (k,p, s) .Finally when the inference rule in (39) is applied to(37) and (35), the result is as shown in (40).
(39) h igher_ in f  four(X,Y,Z,W) if % X>Y>Z>Whigher_inf_t1~ree (X, Y, Z) , % X>Y>Zh igher  (Z,W) .
% Z>W(40) h igher  inf four(k,p, l ,s) .Thus the inference in (40) is the result of computingrelative social status of the individuals involved indialogue (21).5.3 Conflicting InferenceLet us consider why the dialogue in (26) is notcoherent.
After the dialogue is parsed, the featurestructures in (41) are collected together with otherfeature structures.
(41) a. S_STATUS h igher  s statusH IGHER mLOWER smb.
S_STATUS equa l_h igher  s statusEQUAL_HIGHER smEQUAL_LOWER mThe Prolog facts in (42a) and (42b) are obtained fromthe feature structures in (41a) and (41b), respectively.
(42) a. h igher (m, sra) .b.
equa l_h igher  (sin, m) .The two facts, however, are not compatible becauseh igher  (ra, sin) means 'not  equa l_h igher  (sm,m) '.Thus dialogue (26) is incoherent in that the relativeorder of social status between the person M whose in-dex is m and the person Sungmin whose index is smis not consistent.6 Concluding RemarksIn this paper we have discussed a method to computerelative social status of the individuals involved in adialogue.
The main points are as follows:First, the problem with previous works is that theycannot incorporate sentence-external individuals uchas speaker and addressee in honorification phenome-non because just a sentence itself is considered.Second, since the Korean honorification systemconsists of subject honorification, object honorifi-cation and addressee honorification, these types ofhonorification should be considered simultaneouslywhen we look at a sentence.Finally, sentence-external individuals et the criteriafor all relations of social status and thus they shouldbe available in the computation of social status.Our approach makes good use of contextual infor-mation such as information about social status andsentence-external individuals.
The advantages ofincluding contextual information in the implemen-tation are that it is possible to catch the contextwhere a sentence is felicitous and it is also possibleto detect whether adialogue is coherent.
If a dialogueis coherent, he order of the social status of the indivi-duals involved in the dialogue is produced, whereaswhen a dialogue is found incoherent, the reason forincoherence is produced.
Our approach sets a newdirection of processing Korean in that it considers andimplements he important fact that a Korean sentenceis constrained by relative social status of the indivi-duals involved in the sentence.AcknowledgmentsI am grateful to Matt Crocker and Lex Holt for valu-able discussion and comments.
