INDEPENDENT TRANSFER USING GRAPH UNIFICATIONLauri CarlsonMaria VilkunaDepartment of General LinguisticsUniversity of HelsinkiHallituskatu 1100100 Helsinki, FinlandIcarlson@finuh.bitnet, viikuna@finuh.bitnetAbstractWe present aMT system that applies graph unificationin transfer from English to Finnish.
The work describedbelow is an outgrowth of a multilingual MT projectinitiated by the IBM in 1987 with the aim of studyingmultilingual translation using a common English lan-guage parser.The transfer system presented here is independent of theparsing and generation modules.
Any source languageparser can be used whose output can be expressed in adirected graph form.
The transfer system is responsiblefor generating target language phrase structure.
Targetlanguage word order and morphology are left to thegeneration modules.The transfer system is lexically based.
Transfer ules,presented in the form of bilingual graphs, are declarativestatements of symmetric transfer elationships betweenwords, phrases or constructions in the two intertranslat-able languages.Transfer is structure driven in that he transfer algorithmtraverses the source language graph, nondeterministicallytrying to apply the relevant transfer rules in the lexicon.Each successful transfer yields a bilingual graph, whosetarget hmguage half is extracted and subjected to lineari-zation and morphological generation.The main f(ycus of attention i  our project is the devel-opment of the lexicon subsystem.
The lexicon systemconsisk~ of separate transfer and monolingual lexiconsand a common lexicon of language independent defini-tions.Keywords: unification, machine translation, transfer,bilingual lexiconI.
Unification based transferOur approach ismore transfer oriented than some otherunification based approaches to MT (e.g., Beaven andWhitelock 1988).
However, we argue, use of graph uni-fication blurs the distinction between transfer and inter-lingua.A feature structure representing a phrase will containinformation atseveral levels of linguistic analysis rangingfrom lexical identity to logical argument s ructure.
Trans-fer rules can express bilingual correspondences at anylevel of abstraction as well as across different levels ofstructure.
(Cf.
Kaplan & al.
1989.)
A transfer rule in oursense can consist of an arbitrary pairing of lexical entries,a complex correspondence across structures (e.g.,"change" of grmnmatical construction i cluding part ofspeech assignments), or a straightforward identificationof arguments in logical form.When the translation relation is best stated in languageindependent (semantic) terms, transfer is trivial.
Thenmonolingual lexicons, analysis and generation moduleswill do most of the work.
Thus, to what extent agiven rulehas the character of a genuine transfer rule will dependon the degree of similarity of the languages under trans-lation in the relevant respect.
For instance, languages withsimilar tense systems can allow a straightforward identi-fication of low level tense distinctions.
Low level transfersimplifies the tasks of analysis and generation and allowstighter control of the translation relation.
In particular,transfer idioms (multiword equivalences) can be stateddirectly without a detour through more abstract repre-sentations.
In this sense, unification based transfer fillsout the space separating interlingua and transfer.2.
ParsingUnlike approaches such as Kaplan & al (1989), whichproduce bilingual descriptions in the course of parsingsource language text, transfer in our system has a com-pleted parse as a starting point.
Currently, this parse isproduced by a general-purpose parser, PEG of IBMT.J.Watson Research Center (Jensen 1986), which is notunification-based.
However, its output is close enough toa directed graph to 'allow conversion into the form re-quired by the transfer system using a simple conversioninterface.It appears to us that this decoupling of parsing fromtransfer is a safe move.
Knowledge of the target languageis not likely to influence ~)arsing of the source languagein any significant fashion .60 13. lhe transfer systemOur Iransfer system consists of two modules.
A decla-rative module defines translation correst)ondenees of in-dividual phrases, structures and features.
The informa-tion is given in bilingual (or multilingual) transfer diction-aries.An algorithmic modtde actually builds the correspond-ence structure out of the source language f-structure andthe transfer dictionaries.
This component ensures that allnecessary alternatives are considered and the relevantinformation is incorporated into a correct location in thecorrespondence structure.We discuss these two modules in turn.3.1.
The transfer lexiconA leading idea of the lexicon system is the separation offour different lexicons as follows:DGLEXc c T: X ~ E  rPFLEXDGLEX is a lexicon of general linguistic definitions ofterms.
There are two monolingtml lexicons, ELEX andFLEX, and a bilingual u'ansfer lexicon, TFLEX.
Themonolingual lexicons depend on DGLEX, and TFLEXcan refer to the other three.
No further dependencies areallowed.
This increases the independence b tween tilecomponent lexicons and makes them reusable for multi-lingual translation.The descriptions inboth monolingual lexicons are keptindependent of one gmother and linguistically motivated.Complex and ad hoc statements belong in TFLEX; itcannot be expected that all bilingual intertranslatabilityrelations hould follow linguistic generalizations.
Corre-spondingly, we may distinguish two kinds of multi-wordexpressions.
Language-internal idioms (e.g., keep tabs inEnglish) are given in the monolingual lexicons, whereasthe other type, which might be called "transfer idioms",are referred m at the level of tnmsfer entries only (e.g.,have access to, which translates into one Finnish verb).3.2.
The specification languageThe linguistic description language has two levels, aninternal representation in terms of attribute value graphs,and a delinition language consisting of templates abbre-viating such graphs.
As examples of the latter, consklerthe simple entries below.

(The transfer entry is shown expanded into graphform in fig.

)The graph formalism we use is a standard attribute valueunification formalism except for the use of cyclic graphs.The graph specification language xtends the templatelanguage used in D-PATR in the following respects:?
Compile-time disjunction is included?
Parametric templates are included3.3.
Transfer feature structures (TFS)The transfer elation between source and target lan-guage feature structures could be represented in differentways.
Separate feature structures could be set up for thesource language and the target language, and all explicittransfer elation between these two structures could bedefined (Kaplan & al.
1989).
in our system, there is onlyone larger transfer feature structure (TFS) which includesboth feature structures and specifies the explicit ransferrelation for intertranslatable phrases of source and targetlanguages.The TFS contains extra levels ofa|tributes for the soumeand target lar~guagc.
Intertranslalable phrases form sub-descriptions which have two altributes, one for eachlanguage.
The values of these attributes are always trims-2 61\ [F:#10\[LEX:KESKUSTELLACAT:VERBTHEMA:#3\[F: \ [LEX:SECAT:PRONCASE:ELASEM:#2\[ANIM:FHUM:F\]\]\]SUBJ :#5\[F: \ [LEX:*NONE*SEMi\[HUM:T\]\]\]OBL:#3PRED: \[ARGI:#5ARG2:#3ARG3:*NONE*\]VFORM:FINITEVOICE:PASS\]\]Fig.

Transfer rulesA transfer rule in this approach is formally just anothertransfer feature structure, similar to the bilingual struc-ture.
It is a partial specification of an acceptable inter-translatability relation.
The rule is applied to a TFS byunifying it with a specified node in the "ITS.
The transferprocess consists simply of adding of further informationinto a partially described instance of the transfer relation.There is no formal distinction between lexical and gram-matical transfer rules.
Examples of different ypes of ruleare given in figures 3-5.Some aspects of our linguistic description will be brieflydescribed.
In monolingual lexicons, shills in grammaticalfunction like the English active and passive are describedas different Iinkings of arguments to grammatical func-tions, in this case, the subject and the object function.In transfer of complement-taking elements, we can thenfor the most part rely on the simple rule "equate argu-ments", which resulLs in correct bilingual corresponden-ces given the language-particular linkings.
For example,the verb disc~s (fig.
4) rakes as its second argument adirect object in English but an oblique complement inFinnish, but this language-particular informatkm need notbe recapitulated in the transfer entry.There are also translation equivalents whose argumentsdo not match, and these receive slightly more complextransfer rules where argument equations are expressedseparately.Graph unification descriptions are particularly simpleand effective where the relevant structures consist ofpredicates u~king a restricted number of unique argumenttypes, such as subject, object, or sentential complement.Adjuncts, which may have multiple instantiations foreach head, need a different reatment.
Each of the adjunctshas a unique modifiend (modif = the modified word),#1\[E: 'T .

We allow adjunctsto point back to the modifiend so as to let transfer rulesrefer to properties of the rnodifiend.
This means that aTFS can be a cyclic graph.
This is illustrated in fig.

~,~neroHonSince complex aspects of the transfer mapping arehandled by the parser and the transfer system, generationin our model remains imple.
It involves a recursive sortof the lexical entxies of the target language and the gener-ation of morphologically inflected forms from sets ofmorphological features.The linearization component uses a set of unificationbased LP rules operating on information in the finalFinnish feature structure.
Discourse-related informationrelevant tot linearization is included in the feature struc-ture.For Finnish subjectless clause types, we use a transferntle thai requires equation of rite English subject with theFinnish discourse function THEMA.
Depending onclause type, any one of the Finnish arguments may appearas a TI-iEMA (e.g., "about it one-must discuss"; see fig.7).
The linearization rule then places the THEMA beforethe finite verb, preserving, in effect, the characteristicinformation structure of the English sentence.our experience.
In conclusion, we survey the propertiesof graph unification that have proved valuable.o Recursive structure of qTS: No limit to the complex~ity of an entry.
Multiword entries on a par with oneword entries.Uniformity: Linguistic infommtion at different le~vels represented in a uniform way.
No dichotomy oflexical and structural transfer.Unification: Structure changing correspondencescan be expressed through coindexing.Subsumption: Inheritance of definitions allowsmaking generalisations across entries and lexicons., Partial infornmtion: No requirement of complete~ness of linguistc descriptions for transfer to work.Disjunctions eliminated by underspecification.
Noneed to make translation related sense distinctionsin monolingual lexicons.. Monotonicity: Entries remain valid when lexicon isextended and enriched.
Enables incremental refine-ment of individual entries and grammatical corre~spondences.?
Commutativity and associativity: Entries remainvalid when entries or sense definitions are rear-ranged or regrouped.IF: \ [ LEX:TAYTYA 'must 'CAT  : VERBTHEMA:#3 IF: \ [ LEX:SE  ' it'CAT  : PRONCASE :ELA\] \]VCOMP : # 9 \[F : #i0 \[LEX : KESKUSTELLA' d i scuss 'CAT  : VERBTHEMA : #3SUBJ :#b\ [F :  \ [ LEX:*NONE*SEN:  \[I!UM:T\]\]\]OBL  : # 3VFORM : INF IVOICF, :ACT\] \]VFORM:F IN ITEVOICE  :ACT\] \]Notes1 Since unification-based transfer is monotonic, the assump-tion of completeness of input is not essential for us.
