MercerMahzereen AkterDepartment of Computer ScienceThe University of Western OntarioLondon, Ontario, Canadamercer@csd.uwo.caAbstractIn the experimental sciences authors usethe scientific article to express their find-ings by making an argumentative claim.While past studies have located the claimin the Abstract, the Introduction, and inthe Discussion section, in this paper we fo-cus on the article title as a potential sourceof the claim.
Our investigation has sug-gested that titles which contain a tensedverb almost certainly announce the argu-ment claim while titles which do not con-tain a tensed verb have varied announce-ments.
Another observation that we haveconfirmed in our dataset is that the fre-quency of verbs in titles of experimentalresearch articles has increased over time.1 IntroductionIn this paper we are interested in determiningwhat is being claimed in articles in experimen-tal (not clinical) biomedical literature, in partic-ular.
Claims have been studied in the argumen-tation literature from many different standpoints(White, 2009).
Rhetorical structure theory wasdeveloped from systemic functional linguistics tomap connections among texts (Mann and Thomp-son, 1987); Argumentative zoning was developedfrom Swales?
CARS model of moves made in re-search articles (Teufel, 1999; Teufel and Moens,1999; Teufel and Moens, 2002).
Toulmin-basedanalysis has also been used to map the argumen-tative structure of articles (Toulmin, 1958 2003;Jenicek, 2006; Reed and Rowe, 2006; Graves etal., 2013; Graves, 2013).
With these models ofargument in mind, we view the claim of a scien-tific argument as the conclusion that the authorsinfer from known information and new informa-tion (results from an experiment or other forms ofobservations).
Past studies locate the claim in theAbstract (Kanoksilapatham, 2013), at the end ofthe Introduction (Swales, 1990; Swales and Najjar,1987; Kanoksilapatham, 2005; Kanoksilapatham,2012), and in the Discussion section (Kanoksilap-atham, 2005).
Our observations of changes in thegenre of the research article have led us to per-form a preliminary investigation of titles with theoutcome being a provisional typology.2 MethodThe Genia Tagger uses the Penn Treebank Tagset.In the following we mention the verb tags fromthis tagset: VB ?
base form, VBD ?
past tense,VBG ?
gerund, VBN ?
past participle, VBP?
present tense non-3rd person singular, VBZ?
present tense 3rd person singular.
We ap-plied these tags to the dataset of biomedical ar-ticle titles and abstracts used in this preliminarystudy has been taken from MEDLINE, the well-known biomedical bibliographic repository thatcontains over 19 million citations and abstracts forabout 81% of these citations from approximately5600 journals (NLM, 2013 accessed 3 February2014).
We have curated a small database usingbiotextEngine and some locally developed tools.3 AnalysisFor each title we collect the following:?
cumulative frequency of all verb categories?
whether the title contains a VBP, VBZ, orpassive verb?
whether the title contains a nominalization4 FindingsOur analysis so far has identified three typologies.The articles can be categorized according to genre,purpose and structure.
For titles with verbs theclaim of the title is repeated several times: in the985Our ?analysis ?so ?far ?has ?identified ?three ?typologies.
?The ?articles ?can ?be ?categorized ?according ?to ?genre, ?purpose ?and ?structure.
?A ?typology ?based ?on ?genre ?distinguishesamong ?review ?articles, ?methodological ?articles, ?and ?experimental ?research ?articles.
?Experimental ?research ?articles ?are ?divided ?into ?those ?that ?report ?clinical ?advances ?and ?those ?that ?report ?new ?contributions ?to ?knowledge.
?A ?second ?typology ?divides ?articles ?by ?purpose: ?some ?articles ?summarize ?the ?state ?of ?knowledge ?in ?a ?specialty ?area ?while ?others ?present ?an ?argument ?for ?the ?results ?they ?report.
?A ?third ?typology ?distinguishes ?among ?articles ?based ?on ?the ?structure ?of ?their ?titles.
?Some ?contain ?nouns ?and ?noun ?phrases ?that ?describe ?the ?paper ?topic;?
?others ?contain ?verbs ?and ?verb-?like ?structures ?to ?indicate ?the ?authors?
?stance ?towards ?the ?topic.
?To ?highlight ?connections ?between ?these ?typologies, ?we ?conducted ?some ?theoretical ?sampling ?
(Eisenhardt ?& ?Graebner ?2007, ?Eisenhardt ?1989) ?by ?analyzing ?the ?argument ?structure ?in ?the ?titles ?and ?abstracts ?of ?about ?10 ?sample ?articles.
?These ?samples ?provided ?cases ?for ?use ?to ?test ?and ?inductively ?develop ?theoretical ?concepts ?to ?begin ?to ?account ?for ?the ?relationships ?between ?the ?article ?genres, ?their ?purposes, ?and ?the ?title ?structure.
?This ?analysis ?suggested ?several ?points ?of ?connection.
?For ?example, ?articles ?that ?summarize ?knowledge ?use ?nouns ?and ?noun ?phrases;?
?review ?articles ?summarize ?knowledge ?to ?inform ?readers, ?and ?their ?titles ?describe ?the ?topic.
?Experimental ?research ?articles ?that ?make ?a ?contribution ?to ?knowledge ?present ?an ?argument;?
?their ?titles ?can ?contain ?verbs ?or ?verb-?like ?structures ?that ?explicitly ?state ?the ?major ?claim.
?Figure 1: Genre ty ologyAbstract, Introduc on, and Dis sion sections.For articles without verbs, the claim does not ap-pear in the title or introduction (it does appear int e b tract and discussion sections).
A third find-i g: the frequency of verbs in titles of experi en-tal research articles has increased over time.5 DiscussionWe believe that our methods for identifying titlescould lead to better literature search techniques.If researchers are able to identify the claim ofan article from a search of titles alone, they willbe able to evaluate the relevance of each articlemore efficiently.
We suspect that the increase intitles with verbs and claims in them is an emerg-ing trend, possibly the result of explicit editorialpolicy.
One side effect of including claims in ti-tles may be higher quality writing by the authors.Another result from using verbs in titles could bethe automation of claim extraction.
Finally, hav-ing research scientists use clear language to statetheir claim can have the added benefit of makingknowledge translation more effective by lesseningthe difficulty of reading scientific texts.
This, inturn, might afford greater access to the researchoutcomes by clinical practitioners (one of the mainreaderships of biomedical research).ReferencesHeather Graves, Shahin Moghaddasi, and AzirahHashim.
