c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsAnalytics: climbing up the ladder of behavior controlPatrick Jermann Ecole Polytechnique F?d?rale  de Lausanne Station 20  CH-1015 Lausanne Patrick.Jermann@epfl.chAbstract Learning Analytics can be conceptual-ized as an action control process.
Infor-mation is collected at the behavioral level and then re-mapped to serve diagnosis at higher levels of control.
We describe the rationale for moving up the ladder of be-havior control with examples from eye-tracking and clickstream analysis.
1 Overview Sensors used in analytics collect data at low tem-poral resolutions.
Eye-tracking systems for ex-ample record gaze at a very high rate (250 Hz) without semantic information.
Similarly, click-stream data collected online represent atomic actions that do not reflect the orientation of the learner?s behavior.
On the opposite, the expected output of an analytics system should inform de-cision-making at a much higher level, for exam-ple, is a learner going to drop out of a course at the end of a week, or do partners understand each other.
The gap between sensor data and indica-tors useful for decision requires the re-mapping of behavioral streams into cognitively meaning-ful indicators.
The computation of indicators should ideally be content independent and cali-bration free.
We will describe the development of gaze indicators that reflect the breadth of the fo-cus of attention and the coupling between a lis-tener and a speaker.
In dyadic interaction, these indicators are related to the level of abstraction of dialogue and the quality of interaction.
We extended the rationale of these indicators to the case of one user listening to a video lecture with the notion of with-me-ness: similar to teacherswondering whether their students are ?with them?.
Students who attend more closely to the references made by the teacher indeed achieve better learning.
An obvious limitation of gaze-based ana-lytics is that eye-trackers are not (yet) wide-spread.
We are investigating whether video-watching behavior captured by clickstream logs can serve as a proxy for attention.
First results are encouraging and show that it is possible to define an information-processing index that re-flects the engagement of learners with the video.
This indicator is sensitive to both in video drop-out and course drop-out and reflects whether stu-dents process video superficially (speeding up, scrolling forward) or more intensively (checking back for reference, rewatching).
Similar to the approach we followed for gaze re-mapping, we aggregate the atomic actions (Play, Pause, Seek back) into more meaningful actions that are psy-chologically more meaningful to assess learning strategies.38
