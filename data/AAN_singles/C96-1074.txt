ukAbst rac t'Phis paper describes SemNet the in-ternal Knowledge t{epresentation lbrLOLI'I'A I .
LOMTA is a large scale Nat-ural Language Engineering (NLE) sys-tem.
As such the internal represen-tatiou must be richly expressive, mttu-ral (with respect o Natural Language),and e\[\[icient.
In network representa-tions knowledge is gleaned by travers-ing the graph.
The paper introduces twoI)rol)crties, (d i s t r ibutedness  and non-l inear i ty)  of networks which directly re-late to the efficiency by which knowledgeis obtained.
SemNet is shown to havethe specified properties thus distinguish-ing it (in tc'rms of eIli('iency) ms a. suitablerepresentation for large scale NI,E.1 In t roduct ionNatural Language Engineering (LRE, 1992)(Smith, 1995) is a more pragmatic approachto Natural Langnage Processing than traditionalComputational Linguistics.
It involves seekinga large scale solution to NLP by applying engi-neering principles to utilise all awfilable resources.q'his is in contrast to trying to scale up domainspecific applications, or by first attempting to ob-tain a general theory of language.A core problenr for NLE is the design ofthe internal representation.
An ideal repre-sentation should have several features including: rich expressiveness, readability, cI\[icient stor-age/retrieval of inf'ormation.
Semantic networkshave long been recognised as having the poten-tial to \['nlfil many of these requirements.
This pa-per introduces two new criteria for semantic net-works distribut, edness and non- l inear i ty  andtl,argc_scalc, Objectd)ascd, Linguistic lnl, cracl,or,~l%anslat, or  and Analyserdiscusses their relevance to NLE.
They are par-ticularty relevant in large networks where searchetliciency is vital to real-time system operation.The large scale NLE system I,OLITA (Long,1993) (Smith, 1995) has been designed and im-plemented Ibllowing an NLE methodology.
Its in-ternal representation, SemNet, is a semantic net-work satisfying the above t%atures.
The systemanalyses complex text, and expresses its meaningin SemNet.
'\['his information can then be used toperform reasoning, information retriew~l, or trans-lation.
Knowledge held in the network can be ex--pressed for users by generating natm'al anguage@ore SernNet.The fmrdamcntal principle of Semantic Net-works is that inlbrmation is stored as nodes ~mdares, which represent concepts and relationshipsrespectively.
Within this framework a wide vari-ety of networks exist, e.g.
K I,-ONE based systems(Woods, 1992), SNePS/ANALOG (All, 1993),and (?oneeptual Graph 'Cheery (Sowa, 198/1).
I)i-.reel comparison with these would not be justifiedas each has bec'n designed with different objec-tires.
Ilowever, the paper does discuss aspects o\['@ese representations in order to highlight dit\[~r-cnces and why the authors believe ScmNet is apowerfifl (with respect to search) representationfor large scale NLE.The rest of this paper is organised as \['oflows.
Section 2 introduces distribntedncss andnon-linearity as criteria \['or judging networks amdexplains their significance for NLE.
Section 3 de-scribes the core of SemNet.
Section 4 discusses thedistrilmtedness and nonqinearity of SemNet andsome other well known network representations.Section 5 draws conclusions.2 D is t r ibutedness  andNon-L inear i tyA synta.ctic representation will have a semanticmodel.

...... t\]tl b in?~WNl?igure 1: Figure 1: (a) SemNet event for "Everyfarmer that owns a donkey beats it."
(b) SemNetepistemic event for "Roberto believes that everyfarmer owns a donkey.
"Only event nodes can have a subject, object oraction.
Only action nodes can be an action for anevent node.
A control for each node specifies itstype.
E3 in Figure l(a) asserts that two entities(FAP~MER1 and DONKEY1) are in an beatingrelationship.
The subject/object arcs ensure thatit is understood that farmers beat donkeys andnot vice versa.A fundamental principle of the design is thatconcepts are not reduced to primitives.
The mean-ing of any node is detined in terms of its relation-ship with other nodes, so ultimately each node isonly fully defined by the whole semantic network.It shonld be noted that the event nodes can be thesubject or object, of another event so that SemNetis 'propositional' in the sense used by (Kumar,1993).3.1 Quantif icationA problem for networks is to ensure that relation-ships refer to concepts unambiguously (Woods,1991).
For example without reference informa-tion, E3 in figure l(a), could mean any of: a farmerbeats a donkey, all farmers beat a donkey, all farm-ers beat a (the same) donkey, or all farmers beatall donkeys.
In SemNet this ambiguity is resolvedby attaching the following quantification a labelsto arcs:?
Un iversa l  U refers to the instances of theconcept and says that all the instances of theconcept are involved in relationship specifiedby the event.?
Ind iv idua l  I refers to the concept as a wholeand says that it is involved in the relationshipspecified by the event.alt should be noted that this paper presents a sim-plified account of the quantification scheme used inSemNet.
The full scheme is described in (Short, 1996).?
Ex i s tent ia l  E refers to the instances of theconcept, but the instance involved dependson the particular instance of some other uni-versally quantified concept which is involvedin the event.Existential arcs can be thought of as existen-tially quantified variables in First Order Logic(FOL), which are necessarily scoped by some uni-versal.
To represent an existential that is notscoped by a universal we use the individual ra.nk.
'thus for E2 in figure l(a), the donkey thai; isinvolved depends on the farmer.
This could beinterpreted 4 into FO1, as:-Beats(x, y))' lb demonstrate how SemNet can representcomplex expressions, consider the well known don-key sentence: "Every farmer that owns a donkeybeats it."
Of course to capture this unambigu-ously the meaning has to be agreed.
It is as-sumed that it is correctly represented by the FOLstatement:-A l o, k y(y) Aow.
.
(< y)) -+ y))SemNet represents this as shown in figure l(a).The event 1!
;2 is an 'observing' event, it representsthe assertion of the donkey sentence) l'h is a'defining' event used to build the complex con-cepts I"ARMER1 (farmers that own (and so beat)donkeys) and DONKEY1 (donkeys that are ownedby these Nrmcrs).
For clarity the events linkinghierarchies of farmers and donkeys have been writ-ten as spec (for specialisation).3.2 Representat ion of Bel ief andIntensional KnowledgeIt is important o emphasise that the informationwhich is recorded within SemNet is intended toreflect the world as it is to be understood by theagent that uses the network.
No claim is madethat the representation reflects the world as it re-ally is (if there is such a thing), nor even that therepresentation reflects some consensus view of theway the world is.
Thus from an external view-point the concepts hould be interpreted as inten-sional, ttowever from the agent's viewpoint, they4A current project is looking at providing a formal,type theoretic, semantics for SemNet (Shiu, 1996)5Note that Farmerl in the first formula above rep-resents "farmers that own donkeys" so this formulais inferred by second (donkey sentence) formula, aswould be expected.438constitute the world it believes in, and thus maybe either extensional or intensional.
As it is cmn-bersome to repeal; that we are dealing with theagent's belieN, this shall be taken as read in therest of this section.
Similarly, the agent will bereferred to by the natne I, OI,ITA, as this is theonly agent so far which uses SereNe,.It is possible for LOLITA to believe that an-other agent believes some relation to hohl.
lib,:example, 1,OIXI'A may believe that "l{oberto be-lieves that every l%rmer owns a donkey.
", see fig-ure l(b).
1)istributedness requires that one mayread igl and 1'32 independently front the other.
Ac-eording to the description given so t%r, there is nodifl%rence between the way 1';1 is represented whenI,()M'I'A believes it, and when it; is there merely asa part of some other event which \[,()I,I'I'A believes(of course it could I)e both), q'hns it' 1'31 is read onits own, all that wouhl be said is that some agentpotentially believes in the relation it expresses.
Toidentify any such agent would require some formof search which would be inetficient as very oftenthe agent will be l,()lJ'.l?A, l)istributedness ca.nbe better exploited by using a control.
A statuscontrol makes this distinction, it takes two va.lues:real (when I~OI,I'I'A believes in the event), andhypothetical (otherwise).Statements may either I)e made about conceptsor about the things concepts rel>r to.
Theseeases need to be distinguished, l 'or example, con--sider the three concepts "the morning star", the"evening star" and "Venns".
'Phe nlorning star isthe last p()int of light in the sky to disal)l)ear atdawn, the evening star is Lhe first l)oi,,t of lighLin the sky to appear at dusk, and Venus is a par-ticMar planet of the solar system.
Thus, Mthoughthey have the same extension they are differentintensioually.
Since the representation ret)resentsdifferent concepts I)y different nodes, there inustbe a means to state that two coi, cepts reD,; to thesame objeet.
'\['his is done using an extensionalsynonym event to connect he concet)ts.
The syn-onym event, has no e\[Dct on distributedness ornon-linearity but affects topological dist~mce anddeterrninism of search adversely.This price is justified as distinguishing in-tensional and extensionM concepts is importantin many situations.
For exert,pie, if one tellsLOLH?A "I need a hammer",  one does not wanther to answer that she has found a hammer: "thehammer that you need".
Such misunderstandingswill occur unless the hammer is correctly under-stood as intensional and distinguished in the rep-resentation from extensional hammers.
This isdone using a 'tensional' control stating whethertile node has an extension in the world, an ex-tension in some other franle of existence, such asAgatha Christie's fictional world where tile ham-tner was the lnnrder weapon, or an unkuown ex-tension.
Not('.
that 'tensionality' and belief areindependent.
A relation may be not only hypo-theticM, but also inteusionM: "John believes heneeds a hanlmer".a.a Features  exp lo i t ing  {he searchI)rOl)Oxtlo.sIf controls were written as events, they would beant-directional, involving an uni-directional subject or object arc, i.e.
if a control rel>rs to a node.of the network, there need not be any informa-tion on that node baek to the control.
Such uni-dire(:tional events are beneficial to the (leterntin-ism of search since they restrict the number of arcsthat can be traversed from any node.
Controlsrepresent a fltrther imln'Ovement on distributed-ness since they reduce the number of reqniredevent nodes without Mfecting richness.
The in~formation expressed as controls is never re l~rredto by other events.Controls allow defaulting, which is illegal for thenetwork, l)efaulting consists of assulning somefact, when no information of that fact's type ise.xpressed explicitly.
This means that the infer-.marion expressed by some section of SereNe, canbe unsound with re.spect o the fn\]l semanl,ic net.It might appear suHicient to check all the eventsattached to a node to determine whether a defaultal)l:)lies , but it; shouhl be remembered that eventscan also be inherited from far Ul) the inheritancehierarehy.
Indeed, one of the practical advantagesof distributedness i  that it does away with theneed of inheriting all a nodes 'ancestors' inR)rlna-lion while allowing the benefits of a hierarchiealknowledge base.4 Dis t r ibutedness  andNon-L inear i ty  in knownNetworks'l'his section 1)egins with a discussion of the dis-tributedness and non-linearity of SemNet.
Thelatter part investigates the properties for otherrepresentations.In SereNe, a single ,)(,de (say E, in tigure l(a))tells ns nothing, except that some concept exists.Its controls will specify its type (event, extemsional, real in this case), li',very arc attached tothe node specifies 1~;1 further: the action arc spec-ifies its type (an owning relation), the subject arcspecifies that it is all the instances of I,'AILMI,;I{1that participate in the owning relation in the sul>439ject role, and the object arc specifies th~tt there isa (scoped) instance of DONKEY1 which partici-pates ill the relation in the objecl, role.
This in-formation can be combined into the interpretationthat all instances of Ii'ARMEI{I own a (scoped)) instance of I ONKI,Y1 q'lnls each arc conveysan independent piece of Information which canbe combined compositiona\]ly with other informa-tion known about the node.
The interpretationassigned to a node need not be retracted whenreading more information specifying it: ratherit is augrnented by this additional information.l,'urther information can be obtained by readingtnore of the graph: I,'ARMI'2R1 is a 'subset '6 ofFARMER.
If the whole of the grN)h in figure \[ (a)is traversed then the donkey sentence is inferred.1)'q is still not entirely defined: each node is onlyfully defined by the whole semantic network.
This0xample illustrates the full distributedness of Seln-Net.To demonstrate non-linearity consider againthe highlighted section of figure l(a).
Readingfrom IAI{MLR to I)ONI(I~Y1, gives: r "EntityI,'ARMI'JR is a %uperset' of I,'ARMEI{1, whichis a universal subject of Eu, which has actionB ,ArlS, and existential object \])()NKEY1 .
AI-i' ternatively reading fl:om I)ONKEY1 to FARMLR,gives: "I)ONKEY:I is an existential object for1'32, which has action BLA S, and universal sub-ject FAI/.MER1, which has 'superset' FARMli3R ".Clearly both readings convey the same informa-tion and each sub part would be sound inforn-m-tion in its own right.
SemNet is therefore non-linear.
'i'he remainder of this section describes someinitial investigations into the distributedness andnon-linearity of other representations.
This isdone not as a criticism of other networks, bnt totest out the relevance of these new properties and~flso to try and show where SemNet ditDrs fromother well known networks.
'Fhe 'lUIlox of KL-ONE based systems (Woods,1992), (Beierle, 1992) is Semantic Net based, theA-Box usually consists of a subset of FOL.
Sincethese assertions are expressed ms ordinary logicalstatements, they must be read from left to right:there is a prescribed order for reading them sothey are not non-linear.
Similarly reading ar-bitrary sections of the st~tements i unlikely togive meaningful or sound statements, l 'or exam-pie, reading part of the donkey sentence gives:6The (;erms subset and superset are used looselyhere, formally concepts are interpre(;ed as types andso the in(,erpre~ation is not s~rie(,ly correctrLOMTA is of course able to generate Englishstal;ements rather than |;lm following.Figure 2: I,'igure 2: rU(~T - version of ' l)onkeysentence ' .VxVyHcats(x, ~.j) which is not sound with respectto {;lie full reading.
'\['hus assertions in I(I,-()NI';are neither distributed nor non-linear.CG'I' (Sowa, 1984) builds complex logical as:sertions using contexts.
Figure 2 shows how thedonkey sentence is represented by CGT.
Thisuse of contexts requires the whole context to beread/traversed for any sense to be made.
For ex-ample, the innermost sub-context is interpretedas "Farmers do not Ileat l)onkeys".
If this is re'~dindependently from the rest, the interpretation de-rived is not sound with respect to that providedby the filll context.
'l'hus sub-contexts are notcorn bined compositionally to tbrm the full context.For CG'I' the independent pieces of network mustbe el, tile level of a context rather than its corn- .ponents.
This is less distributed than SemNet,where arcs forrn the smallest independent piecesof the network.Partitioned Networks (ltendrix, 1979) have asimilar notion of context, called spaces.
Thesespaces are collections of nodes and arcs of the fullnetwork.
'\]'hey are aussociated with nodes in thenetwork, allowing them to be referred to.
This al-lows the set of statements within a space to benegated, be the objects of someone's belief, orbe treated in any other propositional way.
A hi-erarchy of these spaces states which spaces havecontents visible to which other spaees.
A space,and the spaces visible from it, is called a vista.This leads to multiple views of a semantic net,where dift~rent vistas express possibly contradic-tory statements, l';ach vista is independent fl'omthe rest of the network in that the rest of thenetwork is invisil01e fl:om it.
Ilowever within avista, spaces may be negated.
Indeed, if a space isnegated, the space in which the negation is madeis visible from it.
As a result, the interpretationof parts of a vista is not guaranteed to be soundwith respect to the vista itself, l?artitioned net-works thus have a low distributedness, but providean alternative means of limiting the amount.of in-tbrmation to be processed.
Unlike distributednesshowever, the creation of vistas requires additionalprocessing.440( : )  .... ( ) ........ -i ..... II=, l .... ( ) : :g : )  ........ ( : , ) : : : : ( )  ......
