ANNOTATION OF ATIS DATAKate Hunicke-Smith, Project LeaderJared Bernstein, Principal InvestigatorSRI InternationalMenlo Park, California 94025PROJECT GOALSThe performance ofspoken lartguage systems on utterancesfrom the ATIS domain is evaluated by comparing system-produced responses with hand-crafted (and -verified) stan-dard responses to the same utterances.
The objective ofSRI's annotation project is to provide SLS system develop-ers with the range of correct responses to human utterancesproduced uring experimental sessions with ATIS domaininteractive systems.
These correct responses are then usedin system training and evaluation.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARIn the next year, SKI will continue to provide MADCOWannotation and other services to the DARPA community.
Inaddition to tasks previously performed, SRI will assume agreater role in the resolution of training data bug reports.RECENT RESULTSSince June 1991.
SRI has produced classification andresponse files for about 13,000 utterances of training data(4000 of these since January, 1993).
A dry run system eval-uation and three official evaluations have been held sincethe project began in 1991.
SKI has produced the standardresponses for all of these evaluations; in all, about 3300ntteranc~s.These tests were performed according to the CommonAnswer Specification (CAS) protocol which is used intraining.
All systems are evaluated on a common set ofdata, with system responses measured against otiicial refer-ence answers produced at SRI in the same manner as thetraining data.In addition to producing the classification and standardresponse files, SKI takes an active role in the adjudicationof test and training data bug reports, initiates nearly all ofthe changes to the Principles oflnterpretation document (abasic set of principles for interpreting the meaning of ATISsentences agreed upon by the DARPA community), andcontinues to support NIST by modifying software and act-hag as a consultant regarding the correct annotation of data.471J
