Lexical Rules is ItalicizedStephen HelmreichDavid FarwellComputing Research LaboratoryPO Box 30001/3CRLNew Mexico State UniversityLas Cruces, New MexicoFax: (505) 646-6218Phone: (505) 646-2141E-mail: david @ crl.nmsu.edu/shelmrei@ crl.nmsu.edu1.0 IntroductionIn this paper we present three types of arguments for a pragmatics-based approach to treating the phenom-enon of lexical polysemy (lexical sense extension) and rebut hree types of arguments hat have been usedagainst pragmatics-based approaches.In particular, we argue that what have been claimed to be rules of lexical sense extension operating on lex-ical items are instead to be accounted for by a process of reference transfer by which the referents of lexi-cal items (and phrases) can be used to refer to related things, as governed by pragmatic rules ofconversation and contextual knowledge.
By contextual knowledge we include that information provided bythe surrounding language, by the salient facts about the non-linguistic context and by the general knowl-edge about he world that can be presumed to be shared by the participants in the conversation.1We except morphological rules, which apply to lexical items, but we argue that these rules are more pro-ductive and the semantics less precise than that suggested by the lexical rule approach, which often treat asingle morphological process as a number of rules, subdivided according to the semantic ategory of thebase or derived item.The structure of the paper is as follows.
Section 2 provides ome background material on lexical rules andtheir hypothesized grammatical status and contrasts this with our approach to such phenomena.
Section 3presents arguments against he lexical nature of sense extensions rules and for their status as referencetransfer rules.
These arguments show that the domain of polysemous usage is not lexical items, but rathertheir referents.
Section 4 examines the arguments made for their lexical status, which we find wanting.
Weargue that it is indeed possible to separate semantic from morphological phenomena, that blocking or pre-emption can be explained pragmatically, and that, barring syntactic and cultural differences, the range ofpolysemous usage is not language specific.
Section 5 provides aconclusion.2.0 BackgroundAs the field of NLP has matured, the nature of the problem of sense disambiguation for lexical items hasbecome clearer (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991; Levin, 1993; Nirenburg 1996; Pustejovsky & Bergler, 1992;1.
In general, we prefer to classify context not on the basis of its type, but rather on its use.
So there is a general con-text, consisting of everything, and a subset of that context which is relevant to the interpretation fan utterance.62Saint-Dizier & Viegas, 1995; to name just a few).
First, the wide variety of different uses to which a singlelexical item can be put has been better described.
Second, the semantic relatedness of these uses is morethoroughly understood.For example, the lexical item newspaper can be used to refer to a physical published object, a particularedition, a newspaper company, an editorial staff, an article in the newspaper, or a reporter for the newspa-per.
While this represents a wide variety of different ontological entities (people, physical objects, concep-tual objects, corporations), it is clear that all of these entities are related to each other by the process ofcreating, producing, selling, buying and reading newspapers.
Finally, the same set of uses can be found notjust for newspaper but for other words referring to similar congeries of relationships: journal, newsletter,The New York Times, tabloid and so on.One computational pproach to dealing with this multiplicity of senses is through the use of lexical rules.Within this class would fall the Lexical Implication Rules (LIRs) of Ostler and Atkins (1991), the lexicalrules of Copestake and Briscoe (1991), the Generative Lexicon of Pustejovsky (1995), and the ellipsisrecovery procedUres of Viegas and Nirenburg (1995).
In all these approaches, derived senses are not listedin the lexicon, bat are generated on the basis of rules that operate on a class of lexical items defined by aconjunction of semantic and syntactic/lexical information (e.g.
LIRs) or on the basis of patterns in thesemantic structure of the lexical item itself (Pustejovsky, Copestake and Briscoe).
1In this paper, we take issue not with the computational claims of this approach (i.e., that it allows easieracquisition of lexical items or more effective disambiguation i context), but rather with its linguisticclaims about he status of lexical rules within a formal description of a language.It is our position that the wide variety of uses that any one lexical item may have is not a result of formalmechanisms within the grammar of the language, but rather follow from general knowledge about thethings to which the lexical item is used to refer.
Knowing how a lexical item may be used, then, is not somuch a matter of knowing the language, but of knowing the subject matter under discussion and the cul-tural conventions; of the discussants.
In this respect, our approach aligns with that of Hobbs et al (1987)and of Nunberg (1978) in regarding the process as one which is pragmatic and inferential in nature ratherthan lexical and semantic.We cannot propose here a complete computationally tractable solution.
It is likely that use of lexical ruleswill continue to be valuable in the construction of lexica and within NLP systems.
However, it is not diffi-cult to show how these senses might be derived, nor how they might then be selected in context.
The diffi-culty is, of course, limiting this process to a computationally tractable level.
However, as indicated above,our critique is of the linguistic laims, not the computational ones.This position stems from our basic views about the nature of language.
We distinguish the rules of lan-guage which include the syntactic, phonological, and morphological regularities within which languageusers operate, the interface conventions ofmeaning which relate the elements of the language system (lex-ical items, morphological patterns and syntactic structures) with something outside the system (e.g., usepineapple to refer to pineapples), and the language-independent rules of inference, principles of communi-cation, and world-knowledge which make up the background against which linguistic utterances are inter-preted.
21.
We find less antithetical to our viewpoint he emphasis on the computational value of lexical rules (Viegas et al,1996) and on ellipsis recovery as triggered by syntactic/lexical cues and accomplished through contextual means(Viegas & Nirenburg, 1995).63Whatever the specific status of the conventions of meaning, we expect hem to be vague, minimal, andidiosyncratic.
It is these very qualities that make it unlikely, in our opinion, that these interface conventionsactually function as part of the rules of language.
We do not expect hese interface conventions to berobust, universal, or specific enough to sustain the complex structure of semantic features required by mostlexical rules.
This is not to say that there is no reference to semantic information in any of the rules of thelanguage.
For example, the plural morpheme indicates that whatever is referred to is both countable andthat there is more than one.
For the most part, though, these are basic distinctions that reflect gross seman-tic properties and are only partially correlated with independently verifiable semantics, rather than featuresthat distinguish small classes of lexical items, directly related to external semantic ategories.This position is not, however, that which lies behind the concept of lexical rule.
Ostler and Atkins state, forexample: "We contend that they \[Lexical Implication Rules\] are bona fide rules in the formal grammar oflanguages involved; it is wrong to see them as mere reflections, quasi-systematic effects of applying theformal structure of a language in a real-world context."
(Ostler & Atkins 1991:76).Copestake and Bfiscoe state, "We argue that such processes \[of morphological derivation and metonymicand metaphoric sense extension\] must be treated as, in part, 'linguistic,' .... Our account constrasts with thatof, say, Hobbs et al (1987) who posit an underspecified and impoverished lexical semantic representationwhich is enriched through an open-ended process of abductive or deductive reasoning with world (ordomain) knowledge" (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991:88).Pustejovsky is somewhat more careful in his claims about the grammatical nature of the generative l xi-con, and at the same time, somewhat more ambivalent.
On the one hand, he states that "grammatical dis-tinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories" (1995:6) which may imply thatsemantics, and specifically lexical semantics, is grammatical in nature.
On the other, he states that "thesemantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles, what-ever their structure" (1995:6) implying that semantics, and specifically lexical semantics, is extragrammat-ical in nature.
Or again, in stating that "the representation f lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen asjust one of many levels in a richer characterization f contextual structure," (1996:7) he appears to be stat-ing that lexical semantics is extragrammatical.
At the same time, he appears to be stating that lexicalsemantics i grammatical in suggesting that "lexical items.., have a richer typed semantic representationthan conventionally assumed; semantic operations of lexically-determined type changing (e.g., type coer-cions) operate under well-defined constraints.
Different subclasses of polymorphic operations are well-defined, each with independent properties and conditions on their applications."
(1995:57).
Although notexactly lexical rules, his lexical conceptual paradigms (lcp's) (1996:72) function similarly.
12.
It may be plausible as well to distinguish yet another variety of convention: conventions of use.
In this categorywould fall generalizations such as speakers of Australian English often use the term 'Good day' as an introductorygreeting or speakers of German preferentially use a dative-subject onstruction with experiencer verbs to indicatesensations of heat or cold.
Those who regard all these rules and conventions a  equivalent in type will not be per-suaded by all our arguments here.
But for them, there is only one system of knowledge, which contains both linguisticand world knowledge.
They do not distinguish between types of knowledge, and so the claim that certain knowledgeis of a particular subtype (lexical or ontological) has no significance.1.
They do, for example, allow for multiple references in the same predicative situation, something lexical rulesdon't.
However, note that Pustejovsky's account of the differing referential properties of book and newspaper (forexample, the fact that newspaper can be used to refer to the publishing organization while book in general cannot)hinges on small differences in the qualia Of the lexical entry.
Nunberg (1978) proposes more intuitively that a newspa-per identifies its publisher in a way that a book does not.64Common to all these approaches, however, is the claim that lexical rules are necessary because of a crucialinteraction between grammatical nd semantic behavior that can only be accounted for by positing suchcombined syntactic/semantic rules.In contrast, we suggest that there is no need for such rules in a description of the grammar of English, or,indeed, any natural language.
Specifically, we propose that while syntactic and morphological features andrules will indeed be part of the grammar and part of one's knowledge of the language, the polysemic use oflexical items is entirely separate from the morphological or syntactic rules that may generate the forms andstructures which are to be interpreted.We outline briefly here how such an approach would work, following Nunberg (1978).
Given that a lexicalitem, X, is known to be used frequently by speakers of language Z to refer to (some concept, activity, orobject) Y, and that Y is known to be connected in some way to (concept, activity, or object) W, then lexicalitem X can be used to refer W in (relevant) context C, given certain constraints hat derive from principlesof effective communication.
For example, among such constraints would be that any proposition about areferent, R, must be relevant to C and that the proposition to be predicated of R must be rationally predica-ble of R. If these constraints do not hold for referent Y,but do hold for referent W, for example, then X maybe used to refer to W, and not otherwise.To use a concrete xample, the lexical item, Bach is known to be generally used by speakers of English torefer to the composer, Johann Sebastian Bach.
Bach is known to be a composer and composers are knownto compose music.
Therefore, the lexical item Bach can be taken to refer to Bach's music, given the rele-vant context: 1 was listening to some Bach last night.
This approach as been computationally imple-mented on a small scale in the Metallel program (Iverson and Helmreich, 1992), a reworking of the meta5program (Fass, 1988).In the subsequent sections we argue for this pragmatics and knowledge-based approach and against a lexi-cal approach to the problem of polysemy and sense xtension.3.0 Arguments for a pragmatics-based apporach to the phenomenaIn this section we present arguments in favor of treating polysemy as determined in context on the basis ofworld knowledge and principles of communication, and against reating it as lexical a lexical phenomenon.First, we present two types of putative sense extensions that cannot be accounted for lexically, but whichcan be accounted for under our approach.
We argue that an approach which does not rely on lexical rules istherefore more general and thus preferable.
1 We then present evidence that the formulation of rules is beststated not in terms of a function from lexical items to lexical items, but in terms of a function from referentto referent, independent of the lexical items that are used to refer to those objects or concepts.3.1 Non-lexical regular sense extensionsA lexical rule can only operate if its input and output can be explicitly stated (or at least if the relationbetween them is specifiable).
However, there are innovative uses of language that can be accounted foronly by inferencing in context., 2 since novel uses are necessarily non-conventional and a priori non-identi-1.
There is also a weak (Occam's razor) argument that if a pragmatic hypothesis can account for the data, then it mustbe accepted, as that account will stand independently of any language-specific a count.
That is, the rules of inferenceand the facts upon which they operate xist independently of any language-specific semantics.
At a simpler level, theargument would conclude that lexical rules require the duplication in the lexicon of semantic nformation that is inde-pendently available in the ontology, and are therefore unnecessary.65fiable.
Thus they cannot be the results of the operation of a lexical rule.
As these novel uses parallel ordi-nary lexical rule sense extensions, we claim that our pragmatic reference transfer approach covers abroader variety of cases, and thus provide a more unified solution to the problem of lexical interpretation.We present briefly two such sense extensions: novel metaphors and novel metonymy.3.1.1 Novel metaphorsThis includes both novel elaborations of well-known metaphors, as suggested in of Lakoff & Johnson(1980) and Martin (1990) and completely new metaphors.
We hesitate to provide any examples of novelmetaphors, as they will quickly become semi-conventional, but it should be clear that such metaphors canbe interpreted only through the use of non-linguistic (non-conventional) means.
If these same means canaccount for extensions of conventional metaphors, it would seem reasonable to account for both classes inthe same way.
In this category (of novel elaborations of well-known metaphors) are such utterances as (1).
(1) The ideas were bouncing around in her head.This utterance xploits a conventional metaphor for talking about beliefs, i.e., the mind (head) as (physical)container and ideas as the (physical) objects contained, and extends that in a novel way to describe intensemental activity (possibly either creative or chaotic).
1 To arrive at an interpretation of were bouncingaround, one must both know about objects bouncing around inside containers (i.e., the usual sense ofbounce around) and about the mental process of integrating new ideas into a consistent world view andinfer (possibly) that what is being described is a situation in which the ideas are not getting integrated.While it is true that this is a productive metaphor, so that most verbs of physical activity can be used torefer to mental activities, the actual communicated intent of the reference is not specifiable.
For example,what it would mean for ideas to congeal, and how that would differ from ideas freezing is not determinablefrom information about he lexical items congeal and freeze but only from their use in a context hat allowsus to relate their literal use with what we know about mental activity.
That is, we need to reason simulta-neously within two non-linguistic domains to arrive at a meaning for bounce around.
It is unlikely that anytwo people would come up with the same description (paraphrase) of what the expression means withoutfurther context.
The point here is that since metaphors must be interpreted and interpretable within a spe-cific context and without any assistance from some lexicalized metaphorical sense extension, the interpre-tation of head as mind can be treated in the same way without recourse to lexical rules.Copestake and Briscoe (1991) mention that they regard the metaphoric extension involving use of a worddenoting an animal to refer to humans as involving a core component that should be expressed as a lexicalrule (1991:89).
We note that there is no need for any novel syntactic apparatus to generate such sentencesas (2).
(2) He is a pig.We would argue strongly that such animal-metaphors are creative in that which aspect (realistic, stereotyp-ical, or phonological) of the animal is applied to the human referent is determined by context.
Thus (1)2.
We are not claiming that all reference transfers are computed unng the act of interpretation.
The criterion sug-gested by Gdce (1975) for conversational implicature holds here, namely that it is not that it is computed, but that it iscomputable.
Similarly, the arguments here against lexical rules apply whether or not the lexical rules are precomputedand stored or apply at run time.1.
Ostler and Atkins exclude such cases from their lexical rules, agreeing with our analysis.66Icould mean that he is messy, that he overeats, or that he is selfish and inconsiderate ( ach a stereotypicalattribute of pigs).
Which ones are appropriate depends on the context.3.1.2 Novel metonymiesThese occur frequently in speech and are readily understood given the particular context in which theyoccur.
However, the terms involved in a specific metonymy are often not semantically related, but simplypragmatically related and, even more often, very contingently so.
Moreover, the relation between originaland transferred referent is quite complex, insusceptible toeasy formulation as a lexical rule.For instance, in (3), the speaker intends the referent of my grandmother to be his grandmother's house.
(3) My grandmother was broken into.
She was on vacation at the time.To arrive at this interpretation, one must reason from one's knowledge of break-ins, that the usual motive istheft, that the usual scene is some living quarters (a house, an apartment, a room) or some other securedobject (a vehicle; a shed, a barn), and so on and their knowledge of grandmothers, or possibly the speaker'sgrandmother specifically, that she is elderly, that she lives in a house, and so on, in order to establish acoherent connection between the speaker's grandmother and a break-in.Again, the resultant interpretation can vary greatly depending on what the addressee knows about break-ins and about the speaker's grandmother o even grandmothers in general.
A lexical rule extending, say,things that possess to things possessed, is difficult to implement, very specific, and insufficient in any casesince it still leaves the problem of inferring what the possession is.Other examples of novel metonymies include (4)--(7)(4) All the speakers are Thursdays except Soames.
(5) Let's see.
Sue Ann is in this pocket and I'm in the other.
(6) That gentleman is a salad, right?
(7) Green means aisle.Without any con\[ext for interpreting them, they are gibberish.
If the relevant meanings can be arrived at bythe application of a lexical rule, that should not be the case.
On the other hand, in context hey normallypass unnoticed, inferencing from knowledge of the world instantly providing the interpretation.3.2 Lexical rules are not lexicalIn this subsection, we present two types of argumentation.
First, we argue that certain proposed or plausi-ble lexical rules are actually best explained in terms of a larger syntactic process, applying to lexical itemsonly as exemplars of syntactic ategories.
Second, we argue that the true domain of lexical rules is not, infact, the lexical item, but rather the referent of the lexical item.3.2.1 Lexical rules as syntactic processesOne of the interesting facts about he use of any natural language is that it can be self-referring.
Any natu-ral language serves as its own meta-language.
Thus, anyone can use any lexical item not only to refer tosome extra-linguistic state of affairs, but to refer to the lexical item, qua symbol.
This symbol, of course,has many representations: phonetic, phonemic, syntactic, or orthographic, as well as more exotic represen-tations such as Morse code, ASCII code, spectrographic, and so on, but it also has many variant formswithin each of those representation (e.g., handwriting, neon lights, type), as in examples (8)--(16).67(8) Cake is a four-letter word.
(9) Brownie is a seven-letter word.
(10) Cake is a noun.
(11) Cake starts with a voiceless top.
(12) Stress ends with 7 dots in Morse code.
(13) Able was I ere I saw Elba is a palindrome.
(14) I is a first person singular pronoun in English.
(15) You just said "cow".
(16) Schwarzenegger's "Hasta la vista, baby" is without question a dramatic masterpiece.Note that this use is not without its syntactic implications: whereas (8) and (10) could be generated by stan-dard rules of English, (9) and (14) could not.However, the rule schema in (17) will produce the correct syntactic structures:(17) NP -> X, where X is any category in the grammar.This will produce the correct results for phrases and lexical items alike.
Since this is a rule of syntax, it ispossible that there is a semantics associated with it, following normal GPSG/HPSG practice.
1Another example of lexical rules as syntactic processes i the proposed LIR that allows days of the week tobe used as adverbs as in (18).
(18) They will arrive Tuesday.It is our claim that this involves a more general syntactic rule which permits a noun phrase to be usedadverbially with a temporal interpretation, as in (19).
(19) They will arrive February 24th, at 11:06 pm, on flight 103.The point is that this sense extension applies not simply to lexical items, but to the referents of nounphrases.
Thus, we find no reason to propose that the interpretation of (18) is to be accounted for by lexicalrule, that of (19) by means of (presumably) a rule of compositional semantics, and that of (20) by prag-matic coercion.
(20) They arrive St. Crispin's.3.2.2 Lexical items as reference transfer rulesIn this section, we show that similar sense extensions apply to referents that meet the semantic riteria forthe extensions, even if the lexical item used to refer to it would not ordinarily meet he semantic riteria, orif the referent is referred to by a compositional phrase rather than a single lexical item.For example, Ostler and Atkins propose an LIR which provides an additional sense for lexical items whosesemantics indicate that they are purpose-built containers.
The semantics of this additional sense is thematerial contained in the container, as in (21).1.
Note that it is not our claim that if a process is syntactic it cannot be lexical.
Following Dowty (1979) and others,we would treat most regular morphological processes as syntactic that is, as part of a set of regular syntactic/semanticrules.
The claim rather is that the phenomenon applies to more than just lexical items, but to phrases and sentences aswell.68(21) He ate three boxes of cereal before I could stop him.The purpose-built constraint seems somewhat narrow to us, but even relaxing this constraint will notaccount for examples uch as (22) and (23).
(22) She drank three slippers of champagne.
(23) The fairy offered him a thimble of dew.It is unlikely that some feature such as +container would be in the actual or inherited properties of the lex-ical item slipper in any lexicon.
Nor, given ordinary ways in which slippers are categorized, would it belikely that some teleological qualia of containing would be in the generative l xical entry for slipper.In fact, even simple inferencing from slippers to containers may not easy for current common-sense KBsystems.
1 Drinking champagne from a slipper probably falls in the same category as wearing a lampshade,stereotypical but unusual behavior at a party or at least he parties uch knowledge based systems appear toattend.However, given h reasonable r presentation f the physical artifact, it is likely that some form of analogicalreasoning could map the shape of a slipper onto that of a container, and similarly with thimble.
2Certainlythis would be more plausible solution than to include +container in some way as part of the lexical seman-tics of slipper.
If this is the case, it becomes difficult to see why a lexical rule is needed at all.
The prag-matic inferencing can occur just as easily (in fact more easily) when the object in question is definitely acontainer.Thus, the constraints on this LIR appear to us to be similar to those they state for the LIR which applies toproduce, e.g., thimbleful from thimble.
They state the semantic onstraint as applying to containers (espe-cially all purpose-built ones) as well as some other items that can be viewed as containers (e.g., spade,spoon, fork, hand, fist, belly) (Ostler and Atkins, 1991:78).
The very inclusion of the phrase viewed as indi-cates to us that it is context-dependent situation which allows the interpretation f the -ful suffix.
It wouldbe our claim that this morphological rule is completely productive.
If examples of suffixation to certainlexical items have not been found, it is not because of restrictions of application of the rule, but ratherbecause of the (real world) improbability of contexts in which the referent of that lexical item can beviewed as a container.3.2.3 Usage extension applies to referents referred to by compositional meansThe interpretation f the following sentences relies on an-item-ordered-for-orderer l xical rule.
(24) The hamburger wants his check.
(25) The burnt hamburger wants his check.
(26) The blonde hamburger wants her check.Assuming an LIR in this case, we know that the word hamburger, which ordinarily refers to a food item,can also, in certain situations, be used to refer to the person who ordered it, who is eating it, who wants it,or who is in some way connected to it 3.1.
We actually tried and failed to find a connection between slippers and containers in the CYC data base.2.
Many other means of making the connection are possible.
In fact, one of the virtues of a pragmatics-basedapproach is that it does not require that any specific piece of information be present in a particular form.
As long asthe inferences can be made (in whatever way), the account succeeds.69The paradox is that while both the second and third examples are easily interpretable, only one of them isexplicable if the orderer  sense is a rule-generated xtension of hamburger.
This is, if both ham_burgerand hamburger  o rderer  are word senses of hamburger then the third example can be interpreted in astraightforward manner by choosing the hamburger  o rderer  sense of hamburger.
Since hamburgerorderers are people and people may have blonde hair, the blonde hamburger is understood as the blondeperson who ordered a hamburger.However, in the second example no such simple choice is possible.
If the hamburger  sense is chosenthen the burnt hamburger will compositionally refer to a uniquely specifiable burned hamburger.
But theinterpretation we want is the person who ordered the burnt hamburger.
If, on the other hand, we choosehamburger  o rderer  as the interpretation f hamburger as we did above, then burnt hamburger mustbe non-referential (unless the hamburger orderer his/herself is burnt).The reference transfer function approach, on the other hand, which is not lexical and can operate on partsof a phrase or on whole phrases, offers an appropriate solution.
Thus the burnt hamburger is taken to referto a specific burnt hamburger in the domain of discourse, and since it is known to have been ordered, it canbe related to the person who ordered it.Note that this is not a problem just for lexical rules designed to capture arelatively ad hoc relationship suchas ordered-for-orderer.
It can occur with the container-for-contained relationship as well.
Thus, examples(27) and (28) are fine where glass is interpreted as the contents of the glass.
(27) Drink a glass of wine before retiring.
(28) Dnnk this glass of water, nnse your mouth and spit it into this bowl.
(29) Drink the blue glass of wine.but for (29) we have the same problem as above.
Following a lexical rule approach, the interpretation ofglass in the blue glass must be as a container since blueness is a possible attribute of glasses and not wines(contents) and yet the interpretation we need is the contents of the blue glass of wine not the blue glassitself.Yet another example to show that lexical rules are really reference transfer rules is that of scalar adjectives,whose senses vary with the type of object or activity modified.
To deal with this problem, Pustejovskywould say that the meaning of good intersects with some aspect of the lexical meaning of the head noun itis modifying in order to identify the scale along which good is measured (e.g., good weather, good music,good knife, good ball-game).
Though compositional in nature and not treated as a lexical by Copestake andBriscoe (1995), it clearly involves earching the semantic entry for a lexical item to determine the meaningof an adjacent one.
However, this process cannot be limited just to the head noun, since the interpretationof the scalar depending on the whole phrase which it modifies, and not simply the head noun.
For example,the meaning of good in (30)--(32) differs markedly from their respective counterparts in (33)--(35).
(30) good \[Heavy Metal\] music(31) good weather \[for skiing\](32) a good \[hunting\] knife3.
The difficulty here in specifying the exact relationship between the original referent and the referent of the outputof the lexical rule would seem to indicate that he exact nature of that relationship iscontext dependent.
Thus, in Viegas' work, although the notion that there is a missing predicate may be derived on the basis of lexical and syntacticcues, the exact nature of that predicate isdependent on context---though there may be typical predicates, e.g., in l for-got my keys.
the typical understood predicate isbring though it might be leave or pick up or give to the housesitter.70!
(33) good \[Country-Western} music.
(34) good weather \[for fishing\](35) a good \[butcher\] knife or a good \[bread\] knifeIt is music, weather and knife that have qualia, not Heavy Metal or Country-Western, at least not qualia thatwill enable us to determine what good Heavy Metal \[music/clothing/decor} is.
While it is possible to for-mulate more complicated compositional rules, it seems to us implausible that it is some aspect of the com-bination of the meanings of the lexical items bread and knife, or skiing and weather that allows people toknow what a good bread knife or good weather for skiing are.
Rather it is knowing about how temperature,sun, and wind affect skiing and how the bread should look when it is cut.In summary then, we have argued first that there are processes that look much like lexical sense extensionsrules but which cannot be, as the extension must be determined on the basis of pragmatics and world-knowledge.
Second, we have argued that what look like lexical rules are really reference rules and thus tobe handled pragmatically in context, rather than by lexical means.4.0 Rebutting arguments for the lexical nature of sense extension dataIn this section, we examine the arguments hat have been put forward in favor of treating sense extensionphenomena by means of lexical rules.
These are most directly presented in Ostler and Atkins (1991).
InPustejovsky (1995), most of the argumentation is directed towards the opposite position to the one takenhere, namely that the lexicon consists of an exhaustive listing of all senses.
There appear to be three mainarguments for lexical rules: (1) the existence of apparently idiosyncratic and therefore language specificphonological nd morphological constraints on lexical extensions; (2) the phenomenon of blocking or pre-emption (both morphological nd semantic); (3) the language specific nature of lexical extensions.We examine ach of these arguments in turn below.
In each case, we present in general (and often in spe-cific), how we would account for the data and argue against its use to support lexical rules.4.1 Lexicaily specific constraintsThe first argument is that in order to account accurately for the data of sense extension, it is necessary topropose rules which are statable only in terms of a combination of phonological, morphological, and syn-tactic constraints on lexical items, on the one hand, and specific semantic onstraints on the meaning ofthose items, on the other hand.
As indicated above, we are not arguing against morphological lexical rules,as long as they are accompanied by what we have termed minimal semantics.
Thus, in cases where lexicalmorphological rules are proposed with complex semantic onstraints, our approach is to argue for a moregeneral and unconstrained application of the morphological derivation, while arguing that the semanticsare more general, with the more specific readings being determined by contextual information.For example, Copestake and Briscoe (1991) discusses primarily the grinding rule, which creates a massnoun denoting substance out of a count noun.
With their unification-based approach, they claim to accountfor the more specific meat  reading with edible animals (a specialized subrule) as well as the less specificsubs  tance  readings.
Ostler and Atkins propose four different LIRs, all of which change count nounsinto mass nouns (Tree--Wood; Animal--Fur; Animal--Meat: Food Item--Mass).Our claim in general is that it is possible to distinguish the phonological nd morphological constraints hatexist within the language from the semantic rules that govern their interpretation.
For example, instead ofsuggesting that there are several exical rules that relate a count noun sense to a mass noun sense, weassume there is a general morphological rule that turns count nouns into mass nouns, with a semantic rule71that indicates no more than that whatever the mass noun refers to, it is some sort of substance related to theinterpretation of the count noun.
As a result, the rule proposed by Copestake and Briscoe to cover grinding,along with its accompanying specialized meat and fur/skin rules (That coat is rabbit~Those boots are alli-gator), and the more general pulverizing rule (There was rabbit all over the road), as well as the additionalLIRs proposed by Ostler and Atkins can be replaced by a single morphological rule 1 with a minimalsemantic orrelate.
The specialization occurs because of specific world knowledge about he referent of thenoun itself (people eat eggs, many animals have edible flesh, the skin/fur of some animals can be used tomake clothing or accessories, trees have woody trunks), what is the subject of discussion (clothing, cuisine,roadkill, lumbering) and what specifically is being predicated of the referent (it is being eaten, worn, usedfor construction, splattered over the road).Note that this approach accounts for creative uses as well as conventional.
Though badgers and moles arenot marked (+edible) in this culture, one can enthymemically attribute that feature to them in Chinese cul-ture, accounting for the acceptability and understandability of mole as foodstuff as in (36).(36)...
mole is eaten in many parts of Africa.
(LOB corpus via Briscoe and Copestake, 1991:97)Ostler and Atkins point to the exceptions to the food--substance rule such as pea, bean, and lentil (that is, itis not usual to say, Have some more pea).
They claim this is a semantic lass, namely, pulses, whichdefines a class of lexical exceptions.
We suggest that it is rather that the speaker's view of the referents ofthese items that accounts for this exception.
They are small, and a normal portion usually includes morethan one.Thus, even when mashed up, a small portion of peas would contain more than one pea.
We note asimilar exception to the animal--meat and hunting plural rules, where things that are small and normallyeaten more than one to a portion are not normally referred to by a mass term.
Thus, (37) is fine, while (38)and (39) are questionable.
(31) They are out after lobster.
(37) They are out after lobster./Have some more lobster.
(38) They are out after clam./Have some more clam(39) They are out after oyster./Have some more oyster.In addition, other materials (not pulses) resist being viewed as substances in eating situations, such as min-nows, sardines, and oats, which are also small and generally eaten more than one to a portion.Another claimed example of intricate relationships between phonological, morphological, and semanticdata is that of adjectives of nationality being used to refer to people of that nationality.
That is, certainadjectives of nationality, such as French, British, Welsh, can be used as plural mass nouns denoting thepeople of that country: the French, the British, the Welsh.
The claim is, however, that this extension is pos-sible only for national adjectives ending in a sibilant.
Thus, it is possible to talk in general about he Dutch,but not about he German.Here again, it seems that this LIR is part of a larger morphological process in English whereby adjectivescan function as mass plural nouns denoting that set as in The poor you will always have with you, The richare usually powerful, and so on.
It appears that some adjectives which are themselves already derived fromnouns fail to permit this re-nominalization.
In particular, adjectives derived by using the suffix -ian (-an)do not appear to undergo this rule or are actually nouns used adjectivally, such as words ending with -ist,1.
Pustejovsky proposes a process of type coercion rather than a morphological rule.
The only difference in ourapproaches i that for him the subsequent specialization of substance into meat, skin, fur, wood, food Substance, isconstrained by information in the qualia of the lexical item.
For us, the constraining information is located in thebelief systems of the speaker and hearer.72Ior, possibly, -an).
Thus with religions you get the Amish and the Orthodox, but not the Lutheran or theMethodist.
!4.2 BlockingWith respect to blocking, termed pre-emption by Ostler and Atkins, two kinds are distinguished: semanticand lexical.
Lexical blocking occurs when a sense extension (with morphological or syntactic variation --this is important) does not occur because there is already another lexical item of that form with an entirelydifferent meaning.
For example, the nouns referring to dances can be regularly used as verbs referring todancing that dance resulting in "to waltz" from "the waltz" and so on.
But this rule does not apply to "thereel" since a verb "to reel" already exists with a different meaning 2.
We find no difficulty with this readingin the appropriate context.
In addition, it appears that the verb pair was derived from the noun pair, despitethe existence of the homophonic verb, pare.Semantic blocking is a different matter.
In such cases, it is claimed, a lexical rule fails to produce anextended sense if that new sense is already taken by another lexical item.
Thus, the grinding rule of Cope-stake and Briscoe which associates lexical items referring to edible animals with a mass sense referring totheir flesh is blocked in English for such words as cow, sheep, deer, and pig since lexical items referring totheir meat already exist: beef, mutton, venison, pork.
This phenomenon clearly exists.
It is our claim, how-ever, that the preferred analysis would be to view the process as fully productive, and the blocking is due tothe pragmatics of referring.From Grice's (1975) principle of Be perspicuous, a speaker should use a word which is conventionallyused to refer to what they wish to refer to unless they wish to make some specific effect, as in (40), wherethe use of cow to refer to beef is likely to draw attention to the animal origin of the meat.
(40) I'm a vegetarian, I won't eat cow.Similarly, the use of pig in the context below draws attention to the cooking of the whole animal as in (41).
(41) At the luau we had roast pig.4.3 Language SpecificityThe final argument against using pragmatics to account for sense extensions and in favor of the use of lex-ical rules is that they are language specific.
If they were language independent, then we would expect alllanguages to have the same set of, say, metonymic references available.
What is curious is that this is, byand large, the case.We are aware of only a handful of specific claims which have been made that certain sense extensions arelanguage specific: Na (1986), Wakao & Helmreich (1993), and the two examples cited in Ostler andAtkins.
3 Without a good background in the languages involved, it is difficult to discuss the specific data,but we present below several plausible counterarguments to the claims exemplified with this data.1.
An exception here is the Jewish -- though this may be an example of blocking in that the Jews is a moretypical way to refer to the people.2.
Actually, we find this claim questionable, and see no reason why "reel" cannot mean "to dance the reel."3.
There are also apparently examples in Nunberg & Zaenen (1992), but we did not have access to this paper at thetime of writing.73In general, differences in possible sense extensions between languages may well be due to differences inthe syntactic and morphological structures permissible in the language.
For example, the unavailability inEnglish of counterparts o the Ancient Greek examples cited in Ostler and Atkins seems to depend on thenonexistence of a rule allowing modified pronouns in English.
Certainly the temporal adjectives listed(e.g., nocturnal) can produce adverbial interpretations a  in (42) which can be paraphrased as(43).
(42) A nocturnal visitor appeared at the door.
(43) A visitor appeared at the door during the night.Second, apparent differences in sense extensions may be due to a usage preference for a different mannerof referring to the object.
Thus, the data in Na (19xx) appears to show a preference for certain kinds of con-struction that differ from those typically used in English.
Thus while (44) is not ungrammatical, nor unin-terpretable, it is less preferred than the more explicit (45).
(44) Harry-nin khita.Harry-TOP big(45) Harry-nin momcip-i khita.Harry-TOP body size-NOM bigYet a third explanation may be that due to culture specific differences, ome interpretations are not possiblein one language, but are in another.
For example, the data in Wakao & Helmreich (1993) finds that certaincommon sense extensions in English are not so frequent in Chinese and Japanese, and that one, readingMao, is completely unacceptable in Chinese.
This data strikes us as somewhat suspect as other instances ofreading authors are acceptable in Chinese, and the awkwardness of the Mao example may have somethingto do with the special status accorded to Mao Tse-Tung.Finally, dialect difference may be due not to differences in lexical rules, but to differences in other prag-matics aspects.
For example, Ostler and Atkins second example is of the dialect of SBE which does notpermit he days of the week to be used alone adverbially.
For speakers of this dialect, example (46) isungrammatical.
(46) We arrive Tuesday.The claim is that if this usage was pragmatically controlled, it would not be possible for (46) to be fine inmost dialects of English, but not in all, given that culture and world knowledge is presumably nearly equiv-alent in all.
In our explanation, we note again that this sense extension is part of a much larger syntacticprocess by which any temporal noun phrase can be used alone adverbially, as in (47)--(49).
(47) We arrived last year.
(48) We go there every Tuesday.
(49) We'll travel Christmas Eve, and arrive Christmas Day.We are not familiar with the SBE dialect, but in Standard American it is also not usual to use months aloneas temporal adverbials as in (50).
(50) We arrive February.Years specified as numbers are also unusual as in (51).
(51) We came 1995.74Noun phrases, however, denoting the same time period are acceptable, as well as conjoined months and/oryears as in (52)--(55).
(52) We came last year.
(53) We were there February and March.
(54) We arrived March of '96.
(55) We stayed in Stockholm 1994 through 1996.Rather than positing a lexical rule which combines a reference to the special semantic lasses of days,months, and years, it seems more plausible to us to propose a general syntactic rule, whereby any NP maybe generated as a verbal modifier with a temporal significance.
Thus, it is not that there is a category shiftthat turns certain ouns into adverbs with a temporal adverbial sense, but rather they still remain ouns, butare placed in a syntactic ontext which requires a temporal adverbial interpretation.
The minor exceptionsof bare days of the week, single months, and numerical years could be the result of something similar tothe pragmatic feature +heavy that plays a role in Heavy NP-Shift (see Postal, 1975).
This is the phenome-non that makes (56) perfectly acceptable while the nearly similar (57) is awkward and unusual.
(56) They attributed to arson the fire which destroyed 70,000 acres in the Gila wilderness.
(57) ?They attributed to arson the fire.This judgment difference is not due to any formal feature involved in the generation of either sentence, butrather to a pragmatic judgment about appropriateness of use.
Example (57) is not ungrammatical, it is sim-ply not used, since the shift to focus position of the direct object is not justified by its brief and simple lin-guistic description.
It seems plausible that something similar might account for the difference between (50)and (51) on the one hand, and (53) and (55) on the other,In summary, we would claim that there are adequate pragmatic, cultural, and syntactic explanations foralleged language specificity of sense xtension rules.5.0 ConclusionIn this paper we have taken issue with the concept of lexical rule as a rule of grammar combining syntactic,morphological, nd phonological references on the one hand, with reference to specific semantic classes onthe other.
We argue instead for a separation of the two, with the grammar specific rules firmly within thegrammar, and information about semantic lasses firmly in the encyclopedia of general world knowledge.Lexical semantics i primarily a matter of pointing the lexical items toward the appropriate locations in theontology/encyclopedia, without requiring any except he most basic formal semantic properties (mass/count, number, gender, etc.)
as directly referenced by rules of the grammar, properties which have seman-tic correlates, but which function independently in the grammar.
While we have not addressed all claimsmade on behalf of lexical rules, we have provided an alternative explanation i several cases.REFERENCESCopestake, Ann, and Ted Briscoe.
