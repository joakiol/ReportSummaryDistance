Incremental Processing and AcceptabilityGlyn  Morri l l*Universitat Polit~cnica de CatalunyaWe describe a left-to-right incremental procedure for the processing of Lambek categorial grammarby proof net construction.
A simple metric of complexity, the profile in time of the numberof unresolved valencies, correctly predicts a wide variety of performance phenomena includinggarden pathing, the unacceptability of center embedding, preference for lower attachment, left-to-right quantifier scope preference, and heavy noun phrase shift.1.
IntroductionContemporary linguistics rests on abstractions and idealizations which, however fruit-ful, should eventually be integrated with human computational performance in lan-guage use.
In this paper we consider the case of language processing on the basis ofLambek categorial grammar (Lambek 1958).
We argue that an incremental procedure ofproof net construction affords an account of various processing phenomena, includinggarden pathing, the unacceptability of center embedding, preference for lower attach-ment, left-to-right quantifier scope preference, and heavy noun phrase shift.
We giveexamples of each of these phenomena below.Garden pathing (Bever 1970) is illustrated by the following contrasts:(1) a.
The horse raced past the barn.b.
?The horse raced past the barn fell.
(2) a.
The boat floated down the river.b.
?The boat floated down the river sank.
(3) a.
The dog that knew the cat disappeared.b.
?The dog that knew the cat disappeared was rescued.Typically, although the b sentences are perfectly well formed they are perceived asbeing ungrammatical due to a strong tendency to interpret heir initial segments as inthe a sentences.The unacceptability of centre embedding is illustrated by the fact that while thenested subject relativizations of (4) exhibit little variation in acceptability, the nested* Departament deLlenguatges i Sistemes Informatics, Modul C 5 - Campus Nord, Jordi Girona Salgado1-3, E-08034 Barcelona.

?The cheese that the rat that the cat saw ate stank.c.

?The cheese that the rat that the cat that the dog chased saw atestank.Discussing such center embedding, Johnson (1998) presents the essential idea devel-oped here, noting that processing overload of dependencies invoked in psycholin-guistic literature could be rendered in terms of the maximal number of unresolveddependencies a represented by proof nets.Kimball (1973, 27) considers sentences uch as (6), which are three ways am-biguous according to the attachment of the adverb.
He points out that the lower theattachment of the adverb, the higher the preference (he calls this relationship RightAssociation).
(6) Joe said that Martha believed that Ingrid fell today.Left-to-right quantifier scope preference is illustrated by:(7) a.
Someone loves everyone.b.
Everyone is loved by someone.Both sentences exhibit both quantifier scopings:(8) a.
~xVy(love y x)b. Vy3x(love y x)However, while the dominant reading of (7a) is (8a), that of (7b) is (8b), i.e., thepreference is for the first quantifier to have wider scope.
Note that the same effect isobserved when the quantifiers are swapped:(9) a.
Everyone loves someone.b.
Someone is loved by everyone.While both sentences in (9) have both quantifier scopings, the preferred readings givethe first quantifier wide scope.Finally, we will look at heavy noun phrase shift, which is the preference for com-plex object noun phrases to "shift" to the end of the sentence.
Consider the two sen-tences in (10); the second, in which the "heavy" direct object follows the indirect object,is more acceptable than the first.320Morrill Incremental Processing and Acceptability(10) a.

Lambek CalculusWe shall assume some familiarity with Lambek categorial grammar as presented in, forexample, Moortgat (1988, 1997), Morrill (1994), or Carpenter (1998), and limit ourselveshere to reviewing some central technical and computational spects.The types, or (category) formulas, of Lambek calculus are freely generated froma set of primitives by the binary infix connectives " /"  (over), "V' (under) (directionaldivisions) and "-" (product).
With respect o a semigroup algebra (L, +) (i.e., a setL closed under an associative binary operation + of adjunction), each formula A isinterpreted as a subset \[A\] of L by residuation as follows:(11) ~\[a.B\]\] ~- ($1q-82\]$1 E ~a\ ]  & s 2 E ~B~}~AkB\]\] = {sirs' C \[\[AB, s'+s E HB\]\]}~B/A\] -- (sirs' E \[\[A~,s+s' E ~B\]I}A sequent, F ~ A, comprises a succedent formula A and an antecedent configurationF, which is a a finite sequence of formulas.
1 A sequent is valid if and only if in all inter-pretations the ordered adjunction of elements inhabiting the antecedent formulas al-ways yields an element inhabiting the succedent formula.
The following Gentzen-stylesequent presentation is sound and complete for this interpretation (Buszkowski 1986,Dogen 1992), and indeed for free semigroups (Pentus 1994): hence the Lambek calculuscan make an impressive claim to be the logic of concatenation; a parenthetical notationA(F) represents a configuration containing a distinguished subconfiguration F.F~A A(A)~BCut (12) a.
A ~ A id " A(F).
::~ BF ~ A A(B) ~ C \L  A ,F  ~ B \Rb.
A(F ,A \B)  =~ C F ::~ AkBF ~ A A(B) ~ C F ,A=~B /Rc.
&(B/A,F)  ~ C /L r ~ B/AF ,A ,B ,A  ~ C F ~ A A =~ B?
L .R d. F,A.B,A ~ C F,A =~ A.BBy way of example, "lifting" A ~ B/(A\B) is generated as follows:(13)A =~ A B=~ B \ LA ,A \B  ~ BA ~ B/(A\B) /R1 Officially, the antecedent is nonempty, a detail we gloss over.321Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3And "composition" A\B, B\C ~ A\C can be derived thus:(14) BoB C ~ C \LA ~ A B, B\C ~ CA,A\B, B\C ~ CA\B,B\C ~ A\C \REvery rule, with the exception of Cut, where the Cut formula A does not appearin the conclusion, has exactly one connective occurrence less in its premisses than inits conclusion.
Lambek (1958) proved Cut elimination--that every proof has a Cut-free counterpart--hence a decision procedure for theoremhood is given by backward-chaining proof search in the Cut-free fragment.
The nonatomic instances of the idaxiom are derivable from atomic instances by the rules for the connectives.
But evenin the Cut-free atomic-id calculus there is spurious ambiguity: equivalent derivationsdiffering only in irrelevant rule ordering.
For example, composition as above has thefollowing alternative derivation:(15) A=~A B~B \LA,A\B ~ B C ~ CA,A\B, B\C =~ CA\B,B\C =~ A\C \R\COne approach to this problem consists in defining, within the Cut-free atomic-idspace, normal form derivations in which the succession of rule application is regulated(K6nig 1989, Hepple 1990, Hendriks 1993).
Each sequent has a distinguished categoryformula (underlined) on which rule applications are keyed:(16) a. P ~ P ida(A) ~ BA(.a) ~ B_r~4 a (B)~c  \L A ,F~B \Rb.
a(F,A\B) ~ C r ~ A\Br~A &(~)~C r ,A~Bc.
A(B/A,F) ~ C /L F ~ B/~ /RA~A F~B- -  .R  d. A ,F~A.BIn the regulated calculus there is no spurious ambiguity, and provided there isno explicit or implicit antecedent product, i.e., provided .L is not needed, F ~ A isa theorem of the Lambek calculus iff F ~ A is a theorem of the regulated calculus.However, apart from the issue regarding .L, there is a general cause for dissatisfactionwith this approach: it assumes the initial presence of the entire sequent o be proved,i.e., it is in principle nonincremental; on the other hand, allowing incrementality onthe basis of Cut would reinstate with a vengeance the problem of spurious ambigu-ity, for then what are to be the Cut formulas?
Consequently, the sequent approach isill-equipped to address the basic asymmetry of language--the asymmetry of its pro-cessing in time---and has never been forwarded in a model of the kind of processingphenomena cited in the introduction.322Morrill Incremental Processing and AcceptabilityAn alternative formulation (Ades and Steedman 1982, Steedman 1997), whichfrom its inception has emphasized a capacity to produce left-branching, and there-fore incrementally processable, analyses, is comprised of combinatory schemata suchas the following (together with a Cut rule, feeding one rule application into an-other):(17) a.
A ,A \B  => B B /A ,A  =~ Bb.
A ~ (B/A) \B A ~ B/ (A\B)c. A \B ,B \C  ~ A \C  C /B ,B /A  =~ C/ABy a result of Zielonka (1981), the Lambek calculus is not axiomatizable by any fi-nite set of combinatory schemata, so no such combinatory presentation can constitutethe logic of concatenation in the sense of Lambek calculus.
Combinatory categorialgrammar does not concern itself with the capture of all (or only) the concatenativelyvalid combinatory schemata, but rather with incrementality, for example, on a shift-reduce design.
An approach (also based on regulation of the succession of rule ap-plication) to the associated problem of spurious ambiguity is given in Hepple andMorrill (1989) but again, to our knowledge, there is no predictive relation betweenincremental combinatory processing and the kind of processing phenomena cited inthe introduction.3.
Proof NetsLambek categorial derivations are often presented in the style of natural deductionor sequent calculus.
Here we are concerned with categorial proof nets (Roorda 1991)as the fundamental structures of proof in categorial logic, in the same sense that lin-ear proof nets were originally introduced by Girard (1987) as the fundamental struc-tures of proof in linear logic.
(Cut-free) proof nets exhibit no spurious ambiguity andplay the role in categorial grammar that parse trees play in phrase structure gram-mar.Surveys and articles on the topic include Lamarche and Retor?
(1996), de Grooteand Retor?
(1996), and Morrill (1999).
Still, at the risk of proceeding at a slightly slowerpace, we aim nonetheless to include here enough details to make the present paperself-contained.A polar category formula is a Lambek categorial type labeled with input (?)
oroutput (o) polarity.
A polar category formula tree is a binary ordered tree in whichthe leaves are labeled with polar atoms (literals) and each local tree is one of thefollowing (logical) links:A ?
B" .. B ?
A" .- -  U - -  1 (18) a. A\B  ?
A \B  ?B ?
A o .. A ?
B o .b.
B /A .
11 B/AO 1A ?
B" .
B ?
A ?
..c. A.B ?
1 A-B ?
11Without polarities, a formula tree is a kind of formation tree of the formula at its root:323Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3daughters are labeled with the immediate subformulas of their mothers.
The polar-ities indicate sequent sidedness, input for antecedent and output for succedent; thepolarity propagation follows the sidedness of subformulas in the sequent rules: in theantecedent (input) rule for A\B  the subformula A goes in a succedent (output) and thesubformula B goes in an antecedent (input); in the succedent (output) rule for A\B  thesubformula A goes in an antecedent (input) and the subformula B goes in a succedent(output); etc.
The labels i and ii indicate whether the corresponding sequent rule isunary or binary.
Note that in the output links the order of the subformulas i switched;this corresponds to a cyclic reading of sequents: the succedent type is adjacent o thefirst antecedent type.A proof frame is a finite sequence of polar category formula trees, exactly oneof which has a root of output polarity (corresponding to the unique succedent ofsequents).An axiom linking on a set of literal labeled leaves is a partitioning of the setinto pairs of complementary leaves that is planar in its ordering, i.e., there are notwo pairs {L1,LB},{La, L4} such that L1 < L2 < L3 < L4.
Geometrically, planaritymeans that where the leaves are ordered on a line, paired leaves can be connected inthe half plane without crossing.
Axiom links correspond to id instances in a sequentproof.A proof structure is a proof frame together with an axiom linking on its leaves.
Aproof net is a proof structure in which every elementary (i.e., visiting vertices at mostonce) cycle crosses the edges of some i-link.
2 Geometrically, an elementary cycle is theperimeter of a face or cluster of faces in a planar proof structure.

Incremental Processing Load and AcceptabilityLet us assume the following lexical assignments:(19)barn - barn:= CNhorse - horse:= CNpast - )~x)~y)~z(past x (y z)):= ( (N \St ) \ (N \St ) ) /Nraced - race:= N\S+the - the:= N/CNThe feature + on S marks the projection of a tensed verb form; a verb phrase modif iedby past need not be tensed.
Let us consider the incremental processing of (la) as proof2 This criterion, adapted from that of Lecomte and Retor6 (1995), derives from Girard's (1987) long tripcondition, which is an involved mathematical result.
Danos and Regnier (1989) express it in terms ofacydicity and connectivity ofcertain subgraphs.
Intuitively, acyclicity assures that the subformulas ofii-links (binary rules) occur in different subproofs, whereas connectivity assures that the subformulas ofi-links (unary rules) occur in the same subproofs (attributed to Jean Gallier by Philippe de Groote, p.c.
).However the single-succedent (i uitionistic) nature of Cut-free categorial proofs in fact renders theconnectivity requirement redundant, hence we have just an acyclicity test.324Morrill Incremental Processing and Acceptabilitynet construction.

(past (the barn) (race (the horse)))The analysis of (lb) is less straightforward.
Whereas in (la) raced expresses a one-place predication ("go quickly"), in (lb) it expresses a two-place predication (therewas some agent racing the horse); horse is modified by an agentless passive participle,but the adverbial past the barn is modifying race.
Within the confines of the Lambekcalculus, the characterization we offer assumes the lexical assignment to the passiveparticiple given in the following: 44 In general, grammar requires the expressivity of more powerful categorial logics than just Larnbekcalculus; however, so far as we are aware, the characterizations we offer within the Lambek calculusbear the same properties with regard to our processing considerations a their more sophisticatedcategorial logic refinements, because the latter are principally concerned with generalizations of wordorder, whereas the semantic dependencies on which our complexity metric depends remain the same.327Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3I .

This is a measure of the course of memoryload in optimal incremental processing.
We are not concerned here with resolution oflexical ambiguity or serial backtracking: we are supposing sufficient resources that thenondeterminism of selection of lexical entries and their parallel consideration is notthe critical burden.
Rather, the question is: which among parallel competing analysesplaces the least load on memory?Since entropy degrades the structure of memory, it requires more energy to pursuean analysis that is high cost in memory than to pursue one that is low cost.
From thesesimple economic onsiderations we derive our main claim:(29) Principle of AcceptabilityAcceptability is inversely proportional to the sum in time of the memoryload of unresolved valencies.If other factors are constant, the principle makes a quantitative prediction.
We candistinguish two cases: synonymy and ambiguity.
In the case of synonymy, semantics iconstant.

In the caseof ambiguity, prosodics is constant.
It is then predicted that amongst the readings of anambiguous expression, the lower the complexity curve, the more dominant the reading.The complexity profile is easily read off a completed proof net: the complexitybetween two words is the number of axiom links bridging rightwards (forwards intime) at that point.
Thus for (la) and (lb) analyzed in Figures 1 and 2, the complexityprofiles are as follows:(30) 6 b54 b a3 ab b b2 a b1 ab a a0 aa.

Johnson attributes the increasing ill-formednessof centre embedded constructions to the number of incomplete dependencies at the"maximal cut" of a proof net.
This almost corresponds to the maximum height ofa complexity profile here, except Johnson includes no target category, whereas wewill argue in relation to quantifier scope preference that this is critical.
However,we also differ from Johnson in attributing relative acceptability o the area under thecomplexity curve, not only its maximal height.
This is because we believe acceptabilityis to be explained in terms of the energy required to maintain processes in memoryover time, and not just in terms of peak memory load.
Finally, it happens that ourproposal solves a problem encountered byJohnson.
Gibson and Thomas (1996) observethat (33a) is easier to comprehend than (33b).

?The intern who the chance that the doctor lost the reports botheredsupervised the nurse.Johnson notes that his proposal does not capture this difference since both sentenceshave the same size maximal cut.
Under our account, on the other hand, it is the com-plexity curves as a whole that account for acceptability.
In these sentences, althoughthe height is the same, the complexity curves are not: the area of (33a) is less than thatof (33b).
6Thus, whereas Johnson must look to other factors to explain this difference,our account makes the correct prediction.6 To save  space  we exc lude  the  proo f  nets ;  the  curves  are:ababababb ab ab b ba bb b aa a a aabab abab330Morrill Incremental Processing and AcceptabilityII IF .

Preferred ReadingsThe examples o far involve comparison of different expressions, having many differ-ences to which their relative acceptabilities could be attributed.
More factors wouldbe held constant by comparing alternative readings of an ambiguous expression, andmost appropriately of all, a structurally ambiguous expression, where there is no lexi-cal alternation.
Consider the ambiguity that arises in a sentence such as (34) (repeatedfrom (6)) from the possibility of attaching the adverb at different syntactic levels.
Aswe saw in the introduction, the lower the attachment of the adverb in such sentences,the higher the preference (Kimball 1973, 27).
(34) Joe said that Martha believed that Ingrid fell today.In Figure 5 we give the analyses for the lowest, the middle, and the highest attach-ments.
We now abbreviate proof nets by flattening formula trees into their linear rep-resentations ( ince this conceals the order switching of output links, the notation beliesthe underlying planarity, but the portrayal of word-by-word complexity is unaltered).Accordingly, the complexity profiles are:(35) 6 c bc5 c c bc  bc4 abc32 abc  ab  a1 abc  ab  ab  a a0 abca.

Left-to-right Quantifier Scope PreferenceLet us consider now another instance of ambiguity: quantifier scope preference.
Arudimentary account of sentence-peripheral quantifier phrase scoping is obtained inLambek calculus by means of lexical assignments such as the following: 7(38) everyone - )~xVy(x y):= St/(N\St)everyone - )~xVy(x y):= (St/N)\Stsomeone - )~x3y(x y):= St/(N\St)someone - )~x3y(x y):= (St/N)\StGiven these assignments, one analysis of (7a) is that given in Figure 7.
This is thesubject wide scope analysis: its extracted and simplified semantics are as in (39).7 For  a more  re f ined t reatment  (not  requ i r ing  mul t ip le  lexical  categor i zat ions) ,  for wh ich  the resu l ts  ofth is  paper  s tand  unchanged,  see Morr i l l  (1994, Chap.

Lambek proof nets have the property that they can be kept planar underany cyclic permutation of the roots; one can view them as a circular list and requireplanarity on the interior (or exterior) of a disc.
The same proof net would then havedifferent complexity profiles depending on whether one set in axiom links clockwiseor counterclockwise.
Language processing, though, takes place in time, which is notcyclic, so we order the roots along a line, starting, according to the principle of ex-pectation, with the target category.
As a reviewer has pointed out, if, for example, thetarget category were placed at the end of the time line, then the predictions of therelative acceptabilities in (41) would be reversed!For the passive (7b), let there be assignments as in (42).
The preposition by projectsan agentive adverbial phrase; is is a functor over (post)nominal modifiers (the manoutside, John is outside, etc.)
and passive loved is treated exactly like passive racedin (27).

Preferred FormsAnother good test would be to compare different expressions that are synonymous,holding semantics constant.
Our account appears to explain the preference for heavynoun phrases to appear at the end of the verb phrase (heavy noun phrase shift).
Ofthe following two sentences, repeated from (10), the second is more acceptable:(46) a.

Conclusion: Valencies versus Category ComplexityFinally, another dramatic example of unacceptabilitying: 8is provided by the follow-(48) a.

?That that two plus two equals four surprised Jack astonished Ingrid.c.

?That that that two plus two equals four surprised Jack astonishedIngrid bothered Frank.The passive paraphrases, however, seem more or less equally acceptable:(49) a. Jack was surprised that two plus two equals four.b.
Ingrid was astonished that Jack was surprised that two plus twoequals four.c.
Frank was bothered that Ingrid was astonished that Jack wassurprised that two plus two equals four.In Figure 12 we give the analysis of (48b) and in Figure 13 that of (49b).
It is veryinteresting to observe that the complexity profile of the latter is in general lower eventhough the analysis has more than twice the total number of links.8 In some linguistic analyses it is claimed that sentencial subjects are obligatorily extraposed into apresentencial topic position, which is not available in nonroot clauses.
Under our account no suchabstract claims are necessary.336Morrill Incremental Processing and Acceptabilityf.

Still, in as much as structural factors may exist, we think thisexample in particular provides good support for the view that it is resolution of atomicvalencies, rather than complexity of categories, which underlies their contribution toacceptability.337Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3AcknowledgmentsFor helpful remarks I thank Gabriel Bes,anonymous reviewers, and variousaudiences, and especially for recentcomment, Ewan Klein and Mark Steedman.ReferencesAdes, Anthony E. and Mark J.
