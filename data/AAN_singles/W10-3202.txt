We will de-scribe the method to develop for colla-borative editing to review and completethe translation of synset.
This paper aimsto create linkage among Asian languagesby adopting the concept of semantic re-lations and synset expressed in Word-Net.1  IntroductionMultilingual lexicons is of foremost importancefor intercultural collaboration to take place, asmultilingual lexicons are several multilingualapplication such as Machine Translation,terminology, multilingual computing.WordNet is the resource used to identify shallowsemantic features that can be attached to lexicalunits.
The original WordNet is English WordNetproposed and developed at Princeton UniversityWordNet (PWN) by using bilingual dictionary.In the era of globalization, communicationamong languages becomes much moreimportant.
People has been hoping that naturallanguage processing and speech processing.
Wecan assist in smoothening the communicationamong people with different languages.However, especially for Indonesian language,there were only few researches in the past.The Princeton WordNet is one of the semantical-ly English lexical banks containing semanticrelationships between words.
Concept mappingis a process of organizing to forming meaningfulrelationships between them.The goal of Indonesian AWN database man-agement system is to share a multilingual lexicaldatabase of Indonesian language which arestructured along the same lines as the AWN.AWN is the result of the collaborative effort increating an interconnected Wordnet for Asianlanguages.
AWN provides a free and public plat-form for building and sharing among AWN.
Thedistributed database system and user-friendlytools have been developed for user.
AWN iseasy to build and share.This paper describes manual interpretation me-thod of Indonesian for AWN.
Based on web ser-vices architecture focusing on the particularcross-lingual distributed.
We use collective in-telligence approach to build this English equiva-lent.
In this sequel, in section 2 the collabora-tions builders works on web interface atwww.asianwordnet.org.
In section 3, Interpretationof Indonesian AWN, short description ofprogress of English ?
Indonesian translation andthe obstacle of translation.2  Collaborative AWWordNet covers the vast majority of nouns,verbs, adjectives and adverbs from English lan-guage.
The words are organized in synonym setscalled synset.
Each synset represents a conceptincludes an impressive number of semantic rela-tions defined across concepts.The information encoded in WordNet is used inseveral stages in the parsing process.
For in-stance, attribute relations, adjective/adverb clas-sifications, and others are semantic features ex-tracted from WordNet and stored together withthe words, so that they can be directly used bythe semantic parser.9To build language WordNet there are two mainof discussion; the merge approach and the ex-pand approach.
The merge approach is to buildthe taxonomies of the language (synset) usingEnglish equivalent words from bilingual dictio-naries.
The expand approach is to map translatelocal words the bilingual dictionaries.
This ap-proach show the relation between senses.
Thesystem manages the synset assignment accord-ing to the preferred score obtained from the revi-sion process.
For the result, the community willbe accomplish into original form of WordNetdatabase.
The synset can generate a cross lan-guage result.AWN also introduce a web-based collaborativeworkbench, for revising the result of synset as-signment and provide a framework to createAWN via linkage through PWN synset.
AWNenables to connect and collaborate among indi-vidual intelligence in order accomplish a textfiles.At present, there are ten Asian language in thecommunity.
The amount of the translated syn-sets had been increased.
Many language havecollaboration in AWN.?

Collaboration on Asian WordNet3  Interpretation of Indonesian AWIndonesian WordNet have been used as a gener-al-purpose translation.
Our approach was togenerate the query for the web services engine inEnglish and then to translate every key elementof the query (topic, focus, keywords) into Indo-nesian without modifying the query.
The dictio-nary is distinguished by set of entry word cha-racteristic, clear definitions, its guidance onusage.
All dictionary information for entries isstructured such as entry word, multiple wordentries, notes, contemporary definitions, deriva-tions, example sentence, idioms, etc.
All dictio-nary are implemented as text-files and as lin-guistic databases connected to Indonesian AWN.The set of language tags consists of part ofspeech, case, gender, number, tense, person,voice, aspect, mood, form, type, reflexive, ani-mation.3.1  Progress English ?
IndonesianIndonesian WordNet is used Word Net Man-agement System (WNMS) tools developed byAsianWordNet to create web services amongAsia languages based on Princeton WordNet?version 3.0, Co-operation by TCL and BPPTestablish on October 2007.As presented above, we follow the merge tocreate and share the Indonesian WordNet bytranslating the each synonym translation.
Weexpand an appropriate synset to a lexical entryby considering its English equivalent.We plan to have reliable process to create andshare Indonesian WordNet in AWN.

Following the manual to translate theEnglish AWN to Indonesian, we resulted theprogress of AWN at this time.We start to translate or edit from some group ofbase type in ?By Category?.
These base typesare based on categories from PWN.
There is on-ly 21.89% ( approved 25,755 of 117,659 senses )of the total number of the synsets that were ableto be assigned to lexical entry in the Indonesian?
English Dictionary.3.2  Obstacle of Indonesian TranslationWordnet has unique meaning of word which ispresented in synonym set.
Each synset has glos-sary which defines concept its representation.For examples word car, auto, automobile, andmotorcar has one synset.An automatic compilation of dictionary in AWNhave a translational issues.
There are many casesin explanation sense.
One word in English willbe translated into a lot of Indonesian words,glossary can be express more than one Indone-sian word (Ex.
1).One of the main obstacles in studying the ab-sorption of English words in Indonesian words,is the fact that the original form of some wordsthat have been removed due to Indonesianreform process, in which some words have beenthrough an artificial process.
There is no specialcharacter in Indonesian word, especially in tech-nical word, so that means essentially the same asthe English word (Ex.
2).Ex.
1. time framePOS  noun timesynset  time_framegloss  a time periodduring whichsomethingoccurs or isexpected to occur;an agreement canbe reached ina reasonablyshort time frame"Indonesian jangka waktu,selang waktuEx.
2.  resolutionPOS  noun phenomenonsynset  resolutiongloss  (computer science)the numberof pixels persquare inch ona computergenerated display;the greaterthe resolution, thebetter the pictureIndonesian resolusiUsing definitions from the WordNet electroniclexical database.
A major problem in naturallanguage processing is that of lexical ambiguity,be it syntactic.
Each single words must be con-tainer for some part of the linguistic knowledgeneed to ambiguous wordnet sense.
Therefore,11not only a single heuristic translate Indonesianwords.
The WordNet defined in some semanticrelations, this categories using lexicographer fileand glossary definitions relations are assigned toweight in the range.
WordNet hierarchy for thefirst sense of the word ?empty?
there are 10synset words (I take three of ten) that are relatedto the meaning are the following in ( Ex.
3.
)Three concepts recur in WordNet literature thatentail a certain amount of ambiguity : termino-logical distance, semantic distance and concep-tual distance.
Terminological distance, by con-trast, often appears to refer to the suitability ofthe word selected to express a given concept.Semantic distance is understood to mean thecontextual factor of precision in meaning.
Andthe conceptual distance between words, in whichhave relations proved.Ex.

It  precision andrelevance in response to a query  inconsisten-cies.
Schematically the semantic disambiguationare selected in the glossaries of each noun, verb,and adjectives and its subordinates.WordNet information, whose objective is tobuild designs for the association between sen-tences and coherence relations as well as to findlexical characteristics in coherence categories.WordNet became an ancillary tool for semanticontology design geared to high quality informa-tion extraction from the web services.A comparative analysis of trends in wordnet use:1.
Support for the design of grammaticalcategories designed to classifyinformation by aspects and traits, but inparticular to design and classifysemantic ontologies.2.
Basis for the development of audio-visual and multi-media informationretrieval systems.4  Internet ViewerThe pilot internet service based on Wordnet 3.0is published at http://id.asianwordnet.org.5  Discussion and ConclusionAny multilingual process such as cross-lingualinformation must involve resources and lan-guage pair.
Language specific can be applied inparallel to achieve best result.In this paper we describe manually sharing ofIndonesian in the AWN by using  dictionaries.AWN provides a free and public platform forbuilding and sharing among AWN.
We wantcontinue the work defined learning  the servicematching system.
Our future work on AWN willfocuses in development platform WordNet andlanguage technology web services.Although AWN application are going steadily,the limitations are:1.
AWN designed for manual soauthenticity can not be a reference.2.
Classification was performed manually,which means that the reasons and depthof classification may not be consistent.12ReferencesValenina Balkova, Andrey Suhonogov, SergeyYablonsky.
