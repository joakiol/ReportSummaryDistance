Consider the following (gloss of an) input segment:(2) Clause1:BuyOohn3 book7), time|, focus: book7Clause2:Bring(John3 book7 office~), belong-to(office~ John3),time2: time~ > timeh focus: office|Clause3:Read(John3 hook7), aspect: inchoative, time: after(timez)One of the adequate ways of realizing it is:(3) John bought a book.
He brought this book to his office andstarted to read it.Ttiefe are seven instances of the three object-type concepts in thecase-role slots of the input propositions above.
Each of the three con-cepts is realized lexically only once.
In two cases these meaningswere realized through prononlinalization and in one each through def-inite description and ar| elliptic'/ construction.
This example showsthat non-lexical realization is an integral part of the process of lexicalselection m generation.In what fellows we briefly describe the system architecture,, theknowledge structures and the algorithm we use for selecting open-classlexical items in generation.4 The System and the KnowledgeDIOGF.NI~S is a dislributed natural language generation system featuringa blackboard-type control structure.
The processing in it is concertoteated in the knowledge sources which are triggered by the state ofthe various blackboards.
The latter contain the input to generation aswell as all intermediate and final results of DIOGEN&S operation, rep-resented uniformly in a frame-o|icoted knowledge representation lan-guage.
Background knowledge in 9\[OG~qES includes the followingcomponents relevant to the task of lexical selection:a concept lexicon, a set of knowledge structures that describe ob-ject ,qnd eveut-types in the (sub)world of the texts to be generated(the fn'st application of DIOG~'qES is; for example, in the domainof computer hardware maan~ds)o a generation lexicon that F,~ks (sub)world concepts (or, moreaccurately, their instances) with particular lexical units of thetarget Danguage.The above description is necessarily incomplete.

~llle Structure of the Generation Lexicon.4735 The Algorithmin the DIOGENES generator art inslar~tiation f a head-selecfing knowl.-edge source is triggered simultaneously forevery event ,and role instancein the input representation.
The results of their operafiou are posted to apublic blackboard, so that ail knowledge source instances can draw onIhis knowledge in their own decisiou processes.
The knowledge sourcesresponsible for selecting modifiers are triggered when the heads of theirphrases have already been selected.Figut~ 3 illustrates dm algorithm tora single lexical selection (heador modifier) knowledge source.
If an input frame was already menlotonext in the input, the question arises whether it should be realizednon-lcxically, that is, using deictic means (this is the case with the secoond appeanmce of John in (2)).
If so, a proper realization must be,found and posted on the corresponding blackboard.
If this process failsat arty point, We revert o the 'regular' case of lexical realization.
Thislatter consists, first of all, in scanning the generation lexicon in semehof a set of candidate r alizations for the input frame.
(1) is an exampleof such a set.
When such a set is produced, we attempt to filter itby removhlg those candidates that are not compatible with realizationsalready decided upon for other input fi'ames in the same sentence.
Thisprocessing is based on comparing the collocation infonnation in thelexicon entries for the members of various candidate realization seLq.F~r example, if a neighbor frame has already been realizexl as demon-strator, then the collocational intbrmation will filter out all mcmlxa'sof (1) but youth, teenager, man.
If the residual set has cardinality one,we post the result.

This routine uses a well-defined inexact'matchingmetric that e~deulates distances between the meaning of the input franleand the raea,fings of the lexieai units in the candidate realizution set.The closest meaning is then selected and posted.6 Stattas and Future WorkThe blackboard architecture and the inexact meaning matching mod-ule luts been implemented; the collocation treatment module has alsobeen implemented, but extensive testing has not been performed ueto the lack of a lm.ge-seale l xicon.
The anaphora treatment modulehas been implemented for pronominalization ly, and the nnmber ofpronominali,~ation rules employed has to be and will be increased.It is chair that the acquisition of the generation lexicon is a majorand extremely abor-intensive task in natural language genelution.
Theacquisition of this dictionary, especially of the colloeafional informationcannot at present be done automatically.
But the efficiency of the teamof human lcxicograplters working on this problem can be increaseddramatically through the use of specialized intelligent interactive aids.We have developed one such Knowledge Base Maintenance System(el.
