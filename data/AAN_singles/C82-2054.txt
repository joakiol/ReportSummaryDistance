373, I090 Sofia, BulgariaThe present paper discusses the principles of designinga system for man-computer di~lo6ue in natural, language.
Thesystem is being elaborated at the Laboratory of MathematicalLinguistics at the Institute of Mathematics with ComputerCenter of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.The desorlbed system requires:I.
A form~ description of the syntax of basic nuclearstructures of the natural lanEuage sentences which has to beused during the process of syntactical analysis of the users"phrases in a natural language~2.
Techniques for representing in the computer theknowledge about a given problem area.
The obtained descript-ion has to be used during the process of semantical analysisof the users" phrases in a natural language!3.
A dictionary containing the terms used in the chosanproblem area.
The dictionary is compiled by specialists inthe given problem area;4e A dictionary containing the eel-vice vocabulary (in-dependent of a particular problem area) - word-groups as"less than", "geater  than", "equal to", "slid", "or", "as...ash etc.5.
A basic software system - a data base management- 222  -system (for example, a relational DBMS), or a program package(for example, BMDP - bio-medical data processing).
Theseready software products service users of- a given problem areaand they usually have their own language for describing andprocess ing  the data .The cons idered  system i s  viewed as a supers t ruc tureover  the  g iven  so f tware  system and i t  performs:1.
