APPLICATION OF INTENSIONAL LOGIC TO KNDWLEDGE REPRESENTATIONTon~ ChrzFSO Prague,  Czechos lovak iaThe system of  t ransparent  in tens iona l  log ic  (TIL) in t ro -duced by Pavel  Tich~ i s  used as a framework fo r  a descr ip t ionof  knowledge representat ion  in  n~n - machine con,nunicat ion.A deta i led  expos i t ion  of  TIL can be found in  /1 / .A language express ion  denotes  an ob jec t  by express ingi t s  const ruc t ion .
The syntact i c  s t ruc ture  o f  the  express ionre f lec ts  the s t ruc ture  of  the cor respond ing  const ruc t ion  ( thusobeying F rege 's  p r inc ip le  of  oompos i t iona l i ty ) .
To analyze anexpress ion  semant ica l l y  means to determine the const ruc t ion  i texpresses .
Ord inary  language express ions  have o f ten  more thanone ana lys i s .The ana lyses  of  language express ions  ( i .e .
construct~,ions )  can be represented  by ~-express ions .
This  representat -i ona l  language has the same express ive  power (w i th in  the f rame-work of  TIL) as the natura l  language,  but has no ambigu i t ies .The in fe rence  ru les  of  TIT serve  as a theoret i ca l  foundat ionfo r  the  in fe rence  necessary  in  knowledge representat ion .The in f in i te  h ie rarchy  of  types in TIL makes i t  poss ib leto  work wi th  proper t ies  of  p roper t ies  or wi th  re la t ions  betweenan  ind iv idua l  and a propos i t ion  in  the same way as the f i r s to rder  theor ies  work wi th  re la t ions  between ind iv idua ls .
Thus,TIL can be cons idered  to  be a l im i t  case o f  the theor ies  ofo rder  n.- 69  -A s~stem for  knowledKe representat ion ,  based on TIL, i sp resent ly  under deve lo~nent .
I t s  knowledge base conta ins  aspec ia l  atom represent ing  the system i t se l f ,  and cer ta in  proc -edures a l low the system to determine the  t ru th -va lue  of propos-i t i ons  concern ing  i t s  knowledge ( th i s  can be cons idered  as arud imentary  form of se l f - re f lec t ion) .
This feature  a l lows thesystem to  in fe r  cor rec t  answers e .g .
in  the fo l low ing  convers -a t ion ,  where x ,y  are  var iab les  fo r  ind iv idua ls  and p i s  avar iab le  fo r  p roper t ies !
rep l ies  from the system are markedby >>>:(I) John is a boy and Paul is a boy.
>>> Hm.
(2) Is Tom a boy?
>>> I don't know.
(3) If x is a boy then you know that x is a boy.
>>> Hm./,4) Is Tom a boy?
>>> No.
(5) x is omniscient with respeot to p Iff( i f  y ins tant ia tes  p then x knows that  y ins tant ia tes  p ) .>>> I-Ira.
(6) With respect to which property are you ommlscent?>>> Boyhood.Not_..ee: Before the start of the conversation, the system is inthe initial state, where basic infer,no, rules have beenprogrammed and grannnar and a dictionary have been introduced.but no fac tua l  knowledge.
The d ic t ionary  ent r ies  conta in  inmost cases on ly  a word, i t s  c lass  and the type of  the ob jec ti t  denotes .The self-referential oapacit~ is one of the strong feat-ures of natural language (thus allowing the linguist to de-scribe the object of his study).
This capacity leads to thepossibility of paradoxioal assertions (the Liars paradox-  asfar as a modification for artificial intelligence is concerned,see Cherniavsky /2/.
Havel /3/).
In the following example, thesystem is ordered to believe a proposition ~8).
which is easi-ly performed ~9) .
Never the less ,  i f  the at tempt  to be l ieve  apropos i t ion  (12) ,  a l thou~l  i t  is"known" to be t rue  (11) .- 70  -(7 )  Tom says that the Earth is round.
>>> Hm.
(8) Belleve the proposition which Tom says\[ >>> OK.(9) Which property does the Earth have?
>>> Roundness.
(10) Paul says that you do not believe the proposition whichPaul says.
>>> ~hn,(11) Is the proposition which Paul says true?
>>> Yes.
(12) Belleve the proposition which Paul says\[>>> Sorry I cannoteNot_._~es In this example, to "believe" is interpreted in such away that the system "believes" a proposition by actual stor-ing its ~epresentatlon.
Thus, the positive answer to question(11) does not imply that the system "believes" the proposit-ion.
Diverse interpretations of "believe" are possibleoThe "the" in (8), (10) - (12) is interpreted locally,i.e.
in the context of the knowledge base of the system.
Thus,if the system knows only one of the propositions which Tomsays, then this proposition is th..~e proposition which Tom sayseThe problem of anal~sls of language expressions (i.e.of  determin ing  the const ruc t ions  expressed by them) i s  notthe main goa l  of  our research ,  Never the less ,  a res t r i c ted  sub-se t  of sc ient i f i c  Eng l i sh  (see  sentence  (5) above) has beendescr ibed  by a grammar, which i s  "a lmost  SLR(O)".
(The s tackautomaton accept ing  the l~u6uage has some s ta tes  wi th  sh i f~-- reduce  and/or  reduce- reduce  conf l i c t s . )
The ana lyzer  g ivesa l l  poss ib le  ana lyses  of the  input  sentence ,  tak ing  in toaccount both the  ambigu i t ies  of  the syntact i c  s t ruc ture  ofthe sentence and the  ambigu i t ies  of  the ind iv idua l  words.
Thesecond case i s  i l l us t ra ted  by the fo l low ing  example:(13) John has a ba l lv(14) John has every  good proper ty  which Paul has.
(15) John has a bro ther ,The sentences  can be rephrased  as(13") John owns a ball.- 71  -(14" )  John inetant ia tes  every  good proper ty  which PaulInst antlat es.
(15")  There i s  x such that  x i s  a b ro ther  of  John.The word "have" in  (13) and (14) denotes  the ob jec ts( i .e .
re la t ions )  denoted by "own" and " ins tant ia te"  in  (13")and (14"), respectively.
(The relation in (15") is dlffloultto  denote by a s ing le  word.)
Thus, the ana lyses  of  sentences(13) - (15) are :(13-) Aw.Some ~x.And \[\[ Ball w\] x\] ?
\[ Own w\] John X(14") ~w.Every x p.Oond\[And \ [P roper ty  p\] .
And \[\[ Good w\] p\] .\ [ Ins tant ia te  w \] Paul p \].
\[ Ins tant la te  w \] John p(15 w) ~w.Some ~ x.
\[ B ro ther  w\] x JohnNotes The in fo rmat ion  of  the d i f fe rent  ana lyses  of  "have" has%o be s tored  in  the d ic t ionary .
Here,  to  own i s  a re la t ionbetween ind iv idua ls ,  to  ins tant ia te  i s  a re la t ion  between anind iv idua l  and a proper ty ,  and in  (15) and (15" ) ,  a re la t io~between an ind iv idua l  and a re la t ion  i s  mentioned (s incebrotherhood i s  a re la t ion  between ind iv idua ls ) .
Thus, ambigui -t ies  of  th i s  sor t  may be reso lved  by examining,  whether thetype of  the denoted ob jec t  " f i t s "  in to  the types  of  ob jec tsdenoted by o ther  words in  the sentence .The s~stem i s  bein~ programmed in  7.7SP and the cur rentvers ion  has some 2500 l ines  of  source code.
