VossMultilingual Computing Branch Multilingual Computing BranchArmy Research Laboratory Army Research LaboratoryAdelphi, MD 20783 USA Adelphi, MD 20783 USAjmicher@arl.army.mil voss@arl.army.milThe morphology of the Arabic language is richand complex; words are inflected to express varia-tions in tense-aspect, person, number, and gender,while they may also appear with clitics attached toexpress possession on nouns, objects on verbs andprepositions, and conjunctions.
Furthermore, Ara-bic script allows the omission of short vowel dia-critics.
For the Arabic language learner trying tounderstand non-diacritized text, the challengewhen reading new vocabulary is first to isolate in-dividual words within text tokens and then to de-termine the underlying lemma and root forms tolook up the word in an Arabic dictionary.Buckwalter (2005)?s morphological analyzer(BMA) provides an exhaustive enumeration of thepossible internal structures for individual Arabicstrings in XML, spelling out all possible vocaliza-tions (diacritics added back in), parts of speech oneach token identified within the string, lemma ids,and English glosses for each tokenized substring.The version of our Buckwalter-based LookupTool (BBLT) that we describe in this poster pro-vides an interactive interface for language learnersto copy and paste, or type in, single or multipleArabic strings for analysis by BMA (see Fig.
1)Figure 1.
BBLT Input ScreenWe originally developed BBLT for ourselves asmachine translation (MT) developers and evaluat-ors, to rapidly see the meanings of Arabic stringsthat were not being translated by our Arabic-English (MT) engines (Voss et al 2006), while wewere also testing synonym lookup capabilities inArabic WordNet tool (Elkateb et al 2006).
WhileBBLT allows users to see the ?raw?
BMA XML(see Fig.
2), the look-up capability that sorts theentries by distinct lemma and presents by Englishgloss has proved the most useful to English-speaking users who cannot simply lookup Arabicwords in the Hans Wehr dictionary (considered themost complete source of Arabic words with about13,000 entries, but requires the user to be able to?know?
the underlying form to search for).Figure 2.

onThe BBLT user can opt to see the glosses with orwithout the clitics or inflections, with theirdiacritized forms either transliterated or rewritten66Figure 3.

It makes use ofwevlets written as both standalone sevlets, ex-tending HttpServlet, and .jsp pages.
One servlethandles running BMA as a socket-server processand another servlet handles request from the input.jsp page, retrieves the raw output from the former,process the output according to input page pa-rameters, and redirects the output to the appropri-ate .jsp page for display.ReferencesBuckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA),Version 2.0, LDC Catalog number LDC2004L02,www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog.Buckwalter,T.
