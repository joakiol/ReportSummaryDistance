AUG. 23-28, 19921 IntroductionThe major goal of the system described here is to providea natura l  envirc~'~nent I for learning to producesentences in French.
In order to achieve this goal, wehave integrated the student into the process.
He should beactive rather than reactive, that is, he should talk notonly when being asked.
After all, he knows what hewants to say, what he lacks are the means of translatinghis thoughts into language.SWIM 2 is an exploratory environment which has beenbuilt to simulate natural earning.
The student asks thequestions and the system answers them.
Any of thefollowing questions could occur in a natural setting : 31) How does one say ?c~a .92) Can one say linguistic fo~m ?3) How should one say idea .94) Why does one say fen'n-1 and not form-2 ?5) What would happen if conceptual rect i f icat ion ?6) What would happen if syntact ic  modif icat ion ?7) What would happen if word y instead of word x ?8) What is the difference between form xand fozaxa y ?leaning-Representafio:t t p~l  lia~Uhtl decitmtlv?t ttIx gargon .

student) asks questions andthe teacher (native speaker, parent/teacher) answers them.2 SWIM is the acronym of See What I Mean ?
It has beenconceived by Michael Zock and implemented by A. Larouion a Macintosh.3 For the time being only the first and last four types ofquestions are implemented for a small subset of French(simple sentences).The first communication-mode (how does one say<idea>?)
raises an interesting problem : how to tell thecomputer what one wants to say (message).
Thefundamental question here is in what terms to codethought and access it.
Obviously, there are several ways.One could ask in another natural language (translation),one could use images, or one could use some form ofmetalanguage.In this paper we discuss ome of the problems that ariseby using a metalauguage.
We then show how a specialcategory of thought, tense, can be communicated bynsing a hybrid form of representation.
But, before doingso let us give a short description of the system.
Formore details see \[ 29, 30, 31 \].2 Description of the systemThe dialogue is initiated by specifying thecommunication mode.
Let us suppose that the user hadstarted with the first question: How does one say <idea>?
In that case the system presents a menu (type hierarchy)from which the user has to choose:Speech act : statement, question, commandActions - processes: taxonomy of verbstense : present, past, future, etc.Discourse objects : taxonomy of nounsnumber : singular, pluralcommunic, status : definite, indefinite,Attributes: taxonomy of attributesBy choosing specific values from a set of al-ternatives, the user tells the system what hewants to say.
4 As the dialogue develops, thesystem builds the underlying meaning in theform of a semantic network.
It then invitesthe user to try to express this meaning, afterwhich it outputs its own form.As one cat* see from Figure 1, the screen isdivided into five parts.
The large window atthe top represents he underlying meaning ofthe message a student is trying to convey.The next two windows contain respectivelythe user's attempt to express this meaningand the system's version.
Possiblemismatches between these two versions arehighlighted on the screen.
This allows thesystem to draw the student's attention toerrors.
Actually, by looking at Figure 1 youcan see that the student made a mistake inthe verb agreement "regard6".
Finally, thetwo windows at the bottom represent, fromleft to right, a snapshot of the system'srcorozy of meaning and the user's mexmry of festa .The former is a device to display, hence to recall theunderlying conceptual representation of a specificsentence chosen from the rt~m~ry of fe rn  window,whereas the latter is an incrementally built database(trace) of all the sentences encountered sofar.The idea behind this separation is to allow the user tomake a contrastive analysis of meaning and form between4 For more details concerning the interface controlling theconceptual input (What to say-component), see Zoek (1991).ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~t' 1992 4 7 6 PREC.

Bycomparing the surface forut and the underlying meaningof two sentences, file user can appreciate he relationshipbetween meauing aud rural.
The critical feature, dig onethat is respousible for the difference of form, ishighlighted by the system.
In our exantple it is the value"singular".Past this point, the user has various options : eithel hecontinues in the basic communication m<rde (How doe~one nay<idea> ?
), or he changes the kind of question hewants to ask.
Let us suppose that he wants to build acompletely different senlence.
In this case he.
could eithergo through the whole routine, which i,~ quitecumbersome, or he could perfomt he conceptual changesdireetely on the graph.
Obviously, this latter metltod ismuch faster.
6Actually, everything you see on the graph, except deep-case relations, is considered by the system as a vaiiablewhose value may be changed irectely by the user.
htorder to do so, he clicks on any of the showu attributes(verb, tense, mode, etc.)
and chooses a new value.
Forexample, if he clicks on the verb "regarder'" (to watch) thesystem answers by displaying a list of cmtdidates fromwhich we must choose.. By clicking on the feature"present", rite system shows different values ( present,past, future, etc.)
of the variable "tense", etc.
Everytiutethe system is given some piece of information it willchange the meaning representation accordingly and, ilasked, output rite corresponding form.
For example, ifone started from sentence (at asking the system to chm~gcthe number of the direct object l?om "singular" to"plural" it would produce (b).
If one asked to change thetense from "simple past" to "present perfect", it wouldproduce (e), etc.a) Le garcon regarda In lille (the boy watched tile J;jr!
)b) Le garcon regarda!ees fill e~s (file boy watched the gir~.
)c) Le garcon a re rrrrrrr~d.~ los filles (the Ir~,y has watched thegirls)AS one can see, this method allows h)r local as well asfor global changes.
Actually, the dialogue describedcorresponds to the commuttication mode 5.
If onechanges only one value each time, asking the system totell right away how this meaning change is reflected inform, one can very quickly build attd explore a largesearch space.
It should be noted, that this kind ofdialogue between man and machine is much faster attd5 See communication mode 8 : What is the differencebetween <form x> and <form y> ?6 Actually, that is one of the major advantages of abstractrepresentations compared to, let us say, icons.
Anotheradvantage is that this kind of representatimt shows on-linehow conceptual or pragmatic choices affect he intermediatestructure, hence more or less directly tile final form.
Inconsequence, by displaying on-line the way how theintermediate structure changes after each choice, we have ameans of moving from a black box to a glass box.
Theformer only shows how changes of the input '(conceptualchoices) are reflected in the output, whereas the latter alsoshows how discourse choices (topicalisation, word choice,etc.)
affect he intermediate l vels.less tedious than it would be betweeu a studeut anti ateacher.

This ntode allows rite user to perforutcertain trausformations such as passive voice orprnnominalizatiou.
In the latter case, the system will askthe user to specify which element he wantspronominalized (the boy, the girl, or both).
A&sume tlutt,starting from the conceptual structure underlying sentence(at, the user wauts to proaontiualize r spectively theagent, the object, and finally both arguntents.
In thesecase,s he would get the following outputx :II regarde la fille.

As he knowsbest what his needs are, he is untst likely to ask theright questions at the rigid moment;On the other hand, the system has also variousshortcomings: (at the linguistic coverage is extremelysmall : only very simple structures c~tn be used; (b) theconceptual interface is a surface- rather than a deep-structure compouent (it already contains the lexiealitems, i.e., the progrant hinks ill terms of the targetlanguage); (c) the size of the discourse universe : one canduly talk about a very limited range of facts; (d) therigidity of the conceptual coutponeut : he order in whichlhe meaning is conveyed isdefined a priori.
The choice ofverbs always precedes the choice of the uouns; (e) theterminology used (metalanguage) may be ilmccessible tothe linguistically innocent user.In the remainder of this paper we will only be eoncentealwith the last point.
More precisely, we will focus on theproblem ol conveying the notious of time, tense attdaspect.
For a proposal of how to increase the power andflexibility of the conceptual compoueat see \[33, 34\].4.
Sentence generat ion and tense specificationWhile much atteutiou has been devoted to rite problem ofrepresenting and interpreting tense \[2, 13, 13a, 13b\],little, if any atteution has been devoted to the problem ofgenerating tense ill the context of natural anguagegeneralimt.
A notable xception is the work of V. Ehrich\[6\] who describes the properties of a situation (aconvenient neutral term for making indiscriminatelyreference to eveals, actious, processes, tates) in terms ofcategory, aspoct, relation, and position.Sentence geaeration consists of translating a conceptualswucture into a surface form.

The problem is in what terms a naiveuser could communicate these abstract notions.4.1 The problem of choosing the right formTense can be communicated by choosing among a set ofmetulinguistic terms (past, present, future, etc.).
Theseterms are actually used in schools, in text books andeven in intelligent utoring systems \[7, 8\].
Yet thisapproach as several shortcomings :(A) Students are not linguists.
While notions such as"past, present, future" seem to be meaningful when wedeal with simple tenses, things change rapidly as soon aswe move to more complex tenses like presentcontinuous, past perfect, etc.
The student is certainlyshort of intuition when he comes across tenses for whichthere is no equivalent in his mother tongue.
(B) There is no one-to-one correspondance b tweengrammatical tenses and semantic values.
The "presentforms" are quite often used in order to convey themeaning of the past, the present, or the future (1-4).
In asimilar vein, past forms can be used with a present value(3)1) J'arrive fi l'instant.
(I have just arrived.)
pl~,2) Je r~fl~chis.
(I'm thinking.)
p I 'g~,,3) J'arrive duns un instant.
(I'm coming right now.
)4) J'arrive.
(l just arrived.)
PKST, - (I ant coming.
)eXYlx~:5) Je venais vous demander une augmemntion(I just wanted to ask for a salary increase) Pr~.qEh~;,(C) The possibility of using a certain form depends onthe context of the sentence (presence of a temporaladverbial, nature of the subject and complements).
7Consider the following examples :6) Je suis content (I am very glad.
);7) * J'dtais content (I was glad.
);8) * J'ai ~t~ content.
(I have been glad.
);9) Hier, j'~tais content.
(Yesterday, I was very glad.
);l O) * Hier, j'ai $t$ content.
(Yesterday, I have been glad.
);ll) Hier, j'ai ~t~ content d'apprendre ton retour (Yester-day, I wa.v glad to learn that you were coming back).While (6) is quite acceptable, its translations into past - -be it the simple past (7), or past perfect (8),-- need anexplicit reference.
Moreover, the form of the past perfectin French can only be used if one refers to an event, - -the ingression of a state,-- as in (11).5.
How to visualize tense ?Icons provide a very natural way of representing tense.Several grammars for English \[21\] and for French \[10\]make use of them.
We draw on these sources and adaptthem for SWIM.
In order to do so we provide the userwith a basic set of elements for translating tense intoicons : (a) a time axis; (b) a representation of the pointof speech (NOW) on the time axis; (c) a set of types of7 When using a specific tense one should also be sensitiveto the kind of inferences the addressee might draw.
Forinstance, the following two sentences have completelydifferent implications.
: (a) I've been thinking about you.
(b)I thought about you.
While (a) suggests that one cares forthe person one is talking to, (b) implies that one doesn't careany more.
(We owe this example to Nicolay Vazov from theuniversity of Sofia)situations (state, event, etc.
); (d) a frame of reference (awindow); and/or (e) a point of reference.The time axis represents he intuitive notion of time asan oriented linear structure.
The time of vertical arclocates the time of utterance: on the left hand side is thepast, on the right the future.
The situation to be referredto can be communicated by choosing an icon from a setof alternatives ( ee figure 7).
The last two components,the frame and the point of  reference represent the way(point of view) the speaker looks at the situation.We start by describing these basic elements and illustratetheir use through examples.
We then explain how theseelements are related to form a coherent metulinguisticvocabulary.5.1 The basic elementsThe minimal machinery necessary for generating tense iscomposed of a time axis with a point of speech (now)and a means of locating an action/event with respect tothis point of speech (Figure 5).point of speechootime axis OFigure 5Reichenbach used the following concepts to characterizetense: a point of speech (S), a point of reference (R) and apoint of event (E).
8 Furthermore he used two kinds ofconnectors in order to express the fact that two eventscoincide with one another C,"), or that an event precededanother C_").

(A) Types of  situation and corresponding icons: Asentence refers to some point in time (temporalsituation).
A situation will be represented by any of thefollowing icons8 Voint of speech refers to the very moment in which theutterance takes place (now).
The point of reference is theperspective from which the event is considered.
The r~intof event is the very moment at which the event ook place(yesterday).AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTnS, 23-28 AO~r 1992 4 7 8 PROC.

The icon reperesenting thissuggests this open-endedness by having fuzzy delimitingzones.
Both ongoing processes and activit ies havea well-defined starting point but no determined point oftermination.
Note however, that activities can beinterrupted at any time and be reported as events.
Let ussuppose that "Paul was swimming", and then stopped.This can be reported by ~Paul swam,.
Te l iep rocesses  do not have this property, because they havesome natural point o f  completion.
If <<Paul wasswimming across the Channel~, and then stoppedswimming, we could describe this situation as Paul hasbeen swimming, but we could not say ~Paul swamacross the Channel.~> In that case, the point ofcompletion can be referred to, even if it is never eached:~Paul was swimming across the channel, but he nevermade it>>.
The situation can also be considered asindeteffninate: ,Paul was swimming across the Channelwhen I last heard about him>~.An event has both a starting point and a point oftermination.
It can be punctual or not.
According toReichenbach it is represented as a point or au interval,whereas we allow for the additional use of a frame.
Anevent can also be considered with regards to the result ofits occurrence.
There are events with a resulting state.
Inthe corresponding icon, we represent this state as adjacentto the event which has brought it about.
Usually, theprecise nature of this resulting state needs to be inferred(cf.
\[10\]): It has been raining; in consequence thepavement is wet, it got comer, there are puddles in thestreet, my hairdress is spoiled, etc.Itabitual events are an undetermined ||umber of events.The icon of habitual events is meant to suggest heirresemblance to states.
It should "also be noted that thenumber of  events may be conceptnally indefinite.Compare: (a)l played tennis many times last year.
(b) 1used to play tennis when I was a young manIn gust case we are dealing with a sequence of individualevents, not with a habitual event.
Hence it is quitepossible to continue the dialogue by asking thefollowing question "how many times did you play?
",while this question .seems quite odd in the second case.
(B) Frame of reference, point of reference: Optionalelements are a frame of reference and a point of reference,both of which can be manipulated by the user.
Theformer consists of a window which represents he periodof time considered by the speaker.
It is usually associatedwith a temporal adverbial (Yesterday Paul visited theEiffel Tower).
The point of reference can be used in orderto represent some instant which plays the role of atranslated point of speech (ht 1980 Paul had alreadyvisited Paris twice.
).5.2 Using these e lements tn produce a t imescenar ioThe procedure is as follows: (a) Choose a suitable typeof situation (icon) to represent the temporal structure ofthe situation; (b) Position the icon relative to the pointof speech; (c) If necessary, introduce and position a frameand/or point of relerence and position it.
(d)In the overallrepresentation, some part of the situation should beadjacent o, or included in an element of reference(point of speech, point of reference, frame of reference).If not, reexamine step (c).Suppose we have an untensed representation f : ~Paulaime la cuisine italienne, (Paul likes Italian cooking).
Inorder to generate the tense, we choose a state and theposition of the point of speech on the time axis (Figure8a).
From this representation the corresponding time(present tense) can be generated.~ml  - - -  - - im lml(a) Pmtul mhne ikcuisine i~licnnc_ (Paul likc~t l altim cooking), .

Theinterpretation of maimer la cuisine italienne,(to likeitalian cooking) in terms of a state should bedistinguished from its interpretation as an event.
Thelatter would be the instantaneous change from one stateto another.

?ilii \[Figure 9This case is to be differentiated from the situationdepicted in Figure 9b.
Here the implicit reference isnow.The past event is considered with respect o the stateresulting from it (present relevance).
In fact, the sametense is used in this ease in French, whereas <<Yesterdaylwrote my paper~ would be used in English in case (9a),and e.l have written my paper~ in case (9b).Another typical case of ambiguity is the use of the"present tense" in French.
The Figures 9c and 9d, whiledifferent in English, yield the same form in French.
Thefirst one (9e) signals habitual or repetitive use of thepresent ense, corresponding to <~I play tennis~.
Thesecond situation corresponds to "1 am playing tennis",implying an ongoing activity at the time of speech.Please note that the first situation does not imply anyactual activity at the time of speech, but only a generalvalidity of a kind of property.
As the icon suggests, itlooks very much like a state.6.
The underlying temporal ontology and itsuse for generation6.1.
Types of situation and correspondingiconsOur classification of types of situation (cf.
also \[2\]) isbased on conceiving the temporal structure of a situationas a result of (a) the lexical meaning, the tense and theaspect of a given verb, (b) the nature of the subject, thecomplements and the time adverb'rals.Lexical meaning : We basically subscribe to Vendler'stypology \[26\] who classifies situations in terms ofstates, activities, accomplishments and achievements.Nakhimovsky, in a more recent classification \[17\],introduces additional features (generic vs. specificresources for atclic processes) to Vendler's punctuality,stativity, and telieity.
Our classification is based on fourclasses of lexical meanings, corresponding tocombinations of the features: punctuality, stativity,telicity.?
punctual events (punctual, non stative, atelic);?
states (non punctual, stative, atelic);?
telic processes.?
atelic activities;Aspect is related to the perspective from which a givensituation is viewed.
Following Comrie \[4\], wedistinguish between perfect, perfective and imperfeetiveaspect.
In French, the imparfait (continuous paso is atypical imperfective form: a situation is considered fromthe inside.
Perfective, on the other hand, considers asituation as a whole.
Per fec t  is related to theconsideration f a given event together with a new statewhich is a consequence of this event happening, forexample, I have prepared some coffee.In our system, perfect is represented by an event with aresulting state.
Aspect plays a dual role: it determines thetype of situation and it allows for choosing a specificframe of reference.Lexical meaning combined with the aspect of the verb,the types of the subjects and complements, and thetemporal adverbials yield the type of situation.
Forexample, the verb dcrire (to write) has an intrinsic lexicalmeaning : atelic activity.
However, it can change :Paul dcrivit un roman (John wrote a novel) : telic process;Paul dcrit des romans (John writes novels) : atelic activity;Paul dcrivait an roman (John was writing a book) : ongoingprocess.6.2.
How to choose the right tense .9The following table shows how tense could be computedon the basis of an iconic representation f a situation.The system determines the position of the main part ofthe situation relative to the point of speech (PS).
Thequalification is necessary only in the case of an eventwith a resulting state, where the event is the main part ofthe situation.If the main part of the situation is posterior to the pointof speech, a future tense is chosen by default, thoughpresent ense remains a possible candidate.
Using eitheror amounts to communicating a special modal nuance.ACT,S DE COLING-92, NArcr~s, 23-28 AOUT 1992 4 8 0 PROC OF COLING-92 NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992~mr tum~fd lo .

\[::~:.~Figure 10specified, and if the type of situation is an event, one canuse the past perfect.
In the case of an event or a punctualevent, the past perfect is a stylistic alternative (polishedstyle).Temporal adverbials are classified as (a) time-positionadverbs (last night, on Monday); (b) as span and durationadverbs (for a month, up to 1979); or (c) as frequencyadverbs (usually, often).
Temporal adverbs constraintense generation.
Durational adverbs may enforce ahabitual meaning on verbs having an intrinsic punctualmeaning : <<He has been diving for several months now.~,Temporal subordinate clauses: In the case of simplesentences, the task of determining the tense from an iconis straightforward.
More subtle strategies are needed insentences with temporal subordinate clauses 9.
Supposethe main clause concerns <<students working>~ (PAST),whereas the subordinate clause is <<the headmasterentering the classroom ~ (PAST).
Let the temporalconjunction be quand (when).
Then we have twopossibilities:9 We leave aside the problem of generating subordinateclauses in the subjunctive mood; many temporalconjunctions (e.g.
avant que : before) require the use of thesubjunctive mood.of quand (when), using icons and strategies similar to theones described by Moons & Steedman \[16\].The way in which temporal subordinate clauses reflect onthe types and order of thesituations has been examined inthe literature (\[24, 15, 16\]).7 Conclus ionWe have presented in this paper amethod of visualizing time,tense and aspect.
By using iconswe have provided the user withan interface that allows him totranslate abstract hought intoconcrete thought.
The advantagebeing that his thoughts areexpressed in terms of concreteactions rather than in terms of a(mere)language, which is oftentoo abstract to be meaningful to the nadve user.8 References\[1\] Allen J. F., Maintaining Knowledge about TemporalIntervals, Communications of the ACM 26 (11),1983.
