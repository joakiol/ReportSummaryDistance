Overview of the DARPA Speech and Natural Language WorkshopLynette HirshmanUnisys Defense SystemsThe aim of the first joint Speech and Natural Language Workshop was to bring togetherthese two research communities, to interchange technical information, to reflect on pastsuccesses and to define future directions for Spoken Language research.
The overallorganization of the technical program was designed 1) to establish some commonreference points by assessing the current state of the art  in both Speech Recognition andNatural Language Processing; 2) to cross-educate r searchers in the discipline of lesserfamiliarity; 3) to highlight areas of common interest, namely prosodics, spoken languagesystems, and development of shared resources; and 4) to present current research resultsin both fields.To support hese aims, the program was divided into roughly four segments.Part 1 (Day 1) focused on the establishment of common ground between the naturallanguage and speech groups and discussion of shared resources and performanceevaluation.Part 2 focused specifically on progress in the area of Spoken Language Systems (morningof Day 2).Part 3 (afternoon of Day 2 and morning of Day 3) focused on research results in theseparate areas of speech and natural anguage.Part 4 (rest of Day 3) focused on topics of joint interest: plans for selecting appropriatespoken language applications, stories of technology transfer, and finally, future plans.In addition, two evening sessions were held.
The first was for demonstrations of runningsystems (including video tapes).
The second was an ad hoc meeting called by GeorgeDoddington (Texas Instruments) to discuss the collection of a new speech/naturallanguage database to drive research and evaluation.
This ad hoc meeting sparked a heatedbut profitable exchange between the groups focused on spoken language systems andthose focused on more conventional speech recognition tasks.
The disagreement centeredon the need to evaluate the contribution of natural language UNDERSTANDING, asopposed to the conventional speech recognition metric of CORRECT TRANSCRIPTION.The spoken language researchers pushed for definition of a task to be performed viaspoken language, where metrics could be developed to measure task performanceindependent of the notion of verbatim transcription.
By the following day, there seemedto be agreement that an application such as travel planning would provide an appropriatetask for purposes of research and evaluation of spoken language systems.
The domain ofair traffic control was also discussed at some length.The workshop was successful in bringing these two groups of researchers together fortechnical discussions.
The reaction to the tutorial sessions was generally very positive,with some frustration expressed at the time constraints, which precluded exploring anytopic in depth.
A number of researchers also expressed frustration at holding concurrentSpeech and Natural Language sessions, because this prevented them from attending bothsessions.
This reaction was taken as a sign of serious interest in bridging the gap betweenthese disciplines.
Overall, the workshop represented a major step towards the realizationof Spoken Language Systems on the part of the DARPA-funded speech and naturallanguage research communities.2
