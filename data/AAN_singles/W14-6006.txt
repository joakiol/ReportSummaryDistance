Proceedings of SADAATL 2014, pages 48?55,Dublin, Ireland, August 24, 2014.A Study of Scientific Writing:Comparing Theoretical Guidelines with Practical ImplementationMark Kr?oll?Know-Center GmbHGraz, Austriamkroell@know-center.atGunnar Schulze?Know-Center GmbHGraz, Austriagschulze@know-center.atRoman KernKnow-Center GmbHGraz, Austriarkern@know-center.atAbstractGood scientific writing is a skill researchers seek to acquire.
Textbook literature provides guide-lines to improve scientific writing, for instance, ?use active voice when describing your ownwork?.
In this paper we investigate to what extent researchers adhere to textbook principles intheir articles.
In our analyses we examine a set of selected principles which (i) are general and(ii) verifiable by applying text mining and natural language processing techniques.
We developa framework to automatically analyse a large data set containing ?14.000 scientific articles re-ceived from Mendeley and PubMed.
We are interested in whether adhering to writing principlesis related to scientific quality, scientific domain or gender and whether these relations changeover time.
Our results show (i) a clear relation between journal quality and scientific impreci-sion, i.e.
journals with low impact factors exhibit higher numbers of imprecision indicators suchas number of citation bunches and number of relativating words and (ii) that writing style partlydepends on domain characteristics and preferences.1 IntroductionWriting good scientific articles is a skill.
Researchers seek to acquire this skill for the purpose of succes-fully disseminating their ideas to the scientific community.
Learning to write good articles is a processthat for most of us starts at graduate level and keeps us company in the course of our careers.
To advancethe learning process, there is (i) plenty of literature out there containing do?s and dont?s, (ii) seniorsadministering doses of advice and (iii) entire lectures dedicated to this very subject.In this paper, we investigate whether researchers do adhere to general writing principles taken fromtextbook literature.
We are interested in whether adhering to writing principles is related to the journalquality, the scientific domain or gender and whether there is a change over time.
Doing so allows us tobetter understand which and to what extent theoretical guidelines are practically implemented.
Devia-tions from textbook literature could be indicators of good practice and if they occur frequently enough,they might also be candidates for textbook updates.Studying current trends in academic writing (cf.
(Tas, 2010)) originates in the domains of pragmaticsand linguistics.
In this research area we recognize two larger directions.
The first one seeks to relatean article?s content to scientific concepts, for instance, whether an article contains a theory or not (cf.
(Pettigrew et al., 2001)) or to scientific discourse elements, for instance, which paragraphs can be relatedto categories such as Motivation or Experiment (cf.
(Liakata et al., 2012)).
The other direction focusesmore on organisation and structure including the analysis of entire scientific theses (cf.
(Paltridge, 2002))or the analysis of single structural elements such as the title (cf.
(Soler, 2007), (Haggan, 2003)).In contrast to previous work, we conduct our analyses at a larger scale.
We thus develop a frameworkto automatically analyze large amounts of scientific articles.
In our experiments we select writing prin-ciples which are on the one hand general and often recommended in textbook literature (cf.
(Lebrun,2007), (Alley, 1996)) and on the other hand automatically retrievable and verifiable by applying text?These two authors contributed equally to this work.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

To give an example, the principle ?use active voicewhen describing your own work?
is a popular one and can be verified by examining the verb types in thearticle?s abstract, introduction and conclusion.
In our study we analyze two data sets - one from Mende-ley1, a popular reference management tool, - one from PubMed2, a free resource containing citationsfor biomedical literature.
We can observe relations between journal quality and textbook recommenda-tions such as Avoid Imprecision and Engage the Reader.
In addition, the results indicate writing stylepreferences due to domain characteristics.
Our findings show that theoretical guidelines partly concurwith practical implementation and thus contribute to better understand the extent to which theory guidespraxis and vice versa praxis might guide theory.The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides details on the used data sets as wellas the software framework to automate the analysis of scientific articles.
Section 3 contains experimen-tal results and discussions of analyzed writing principles.
Related work is covered in Section 4 andconcluding remarks are presented in Section 5.2 Experimental Setup2.1 Data SetsFor our analyses we used scientific articles from two sources - Mendeley and PubMed - which alsoprovided us with meta data, e.g.
name of the conference or journal.
Most of the publication organs werejournals and we decided to select only journals which had a minimum of 10 articles and for which wecould find a respective 5-year impact factor3.
We decided to conduct our analyses over a 10-year timeperiod from 2001 to 2010, since only in this period articles from both sources were available.
In total weexperimented with 13866 scientific articles.
Grouping them according to scientific quality, domain andgender, we constructed three data sets described in the following:- Quality: According to the impact factor (IF), we divided the scientific articles into three groups; lowIF ranging from 0 to 2.5 (2303 articles), middle IF ranging from 2.5 to 4 (5734 articles) and highIF ranging from 4 to 35 (5829 articles).
The ranges were chosen to reflect the journal quality whilecontaining an appropriate (not too small) number of scientific articles per category.- Domain: We divided the scientific articles by their journal type into two groups: biomedical (7053articles) and a technical (6813 articles) which contained mainly articles from physics and computerscience.- Gender: We used two gazetteer lists to identify female4or male5first authors.
Since only a partof the authors?
first names was unabbreviated, we used a subset of articles for these experiments:number of articles with male first author = 1182, number of articles with female first author = 1990.2.2 FrameworkTo automatically analyze large amounts of scientific articles, we designed a framework and embeddedour analysis algorithms in a Hadoop6environment.
The environment allows parallelization of processesand thus greatly reduces computation time.
We stored the results in a PostgreSQL7database for quickaccess and used various Python packages such as matplotlib8for creating graphical representations ofour results.Our first pre-processing step encompassed the extraction of textual content from scientific publica-tions.
To automatically extract the content, we used a processing pipeline (cf.
(Klampfl et al., 2013))1http://www.mendeley.com/2http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed3http://www.citefactor.org/impact-factor-list-2012.html4http://deron.meranda.us/data/census-dist-female-first.txt5http://deron.meranda.us/data/census-dist-male-first.txt6http://hadoop.apache.org/7http://www.postgresql.org/8http://matplotlib.org/49that applies various machine learning techniques in combination with heuristics to detect the logicalstructure of a PDF document.
Further processing steps included (i) tokenization, (ii) sentence splitting,(iii) stemming, (iv) part-of-speech tagging and (v) chunking.
We employed part-of-speech and chunkinginformation in our analyses (see Section 3) to distinguish verb phrases with respect to present vs. pasttense as well as active vs. passive voice.3 Analysis of Scientific LiteratureIn this section we analyze a set of selected writing style principles with respect to Reader Engagementand Imprecision.
Each analysis contains (i) a motivating statement mostly taken from (Lebrun, 2007), (ii)a visual representation of results and (iii) an interpretation of results.
During our experiments we couldobserve that most of the time there were no significant differences between articles written by male andfemale first authors.
We repeated the experiments with a majority criterion of authors, i.e.
more femalefirst names or more male first names per article, resulting in similar findings.
It appears that both gendersadhere to the same guidelines which were standardly used at the time.3.1 Engaging the ReaderIn this section we examine different means to engage the reader according to textbook literature including(i) the title, (ii) figures & tables and (iii) a lively writing style based on using present tense and activevoice.3.1.1 TitleThe title represents the first point of contact with the reader (and the reviewer) and should ideally bemade catchy and standing out.
We examine three means to do that: (i) usage of verbs to increase energy,(ii) usage of acronyms to provide a reference shortcut for others and (iii) usage of questions to create ahook.
Figure 1 contains average numbers of article titles with respect to these means.Figure 1: Illustration of (i) titles containting at least one verb (left), (ii) titles containing acronyms (mid-dle) and (iii) titles which contain a question (right) over a ten-year time period.
The upper row reflectdistinction by domain, the lower row by impact factor.
The y-axis represents the average number ofarticle titles exhibiting the respective feature.The upper left figure in Figure 1 tells us that using verbs in titles is more common among authors inthe biomedical domain than in the physics/computer science domain.
The lower left figure indicates atrend towards using more verbs in the title over the years independent of the journal quality.
The upper,middle figure of Figure 1 shows that using acronyms in titles is more common in the biomedical domain50and a possible trend using acronyms at the beginning of the century.
The lower figure in the middleindicates an up and down over the years across impact factors.
The right figures in Figure 1 tell us thatonly a low percentage of authors use questions in their titles independent of domain or journal quality.The numbers corroborate textbook literatures?
recommendation of using verbs in the titles as well asusing acronyms.
A bit surprising is that questions in titles are rarely used, since according to literaturethey create a mighty hook for the reader.
In a next step we intend to relate the title to the content of theabstract and the introduction to answer the question how well the title reflects the article?s content.3.1.2 Figures & TablesVisual representations of results in terms of figures and partly of tables help the reader to reduce readingtime.
According to (Lebrun, 2007) they even represent visual information burgers which are easy todigest.
Figure 2 contains respective average figure and table counts.Figure 2: Illustration of average figure and table counts over a ten-year period according to domain (left)and impact factor (middle, right).
The y-axis represents the average number of tables/figures per article.The left figure in Figure 2 illustrates that authors from the biomedical domain use more tables andfigures than authors from the physics/computer science domain.
The middle and right figure reflectaverage counts according to impact factor.
Journal articles with a high impact factor contain (i) fewertables than journals with middle or low impact factors and (ii) in general more figures.From the results in Figure 2 we learn that usage of figures and tables appears to a certain degreebe dependent on the domain.
In biomedicine, the usage of figures to convey information seems morewidespread than in technical domains.
We assume even higher figure counts in domains such as chem-istry where illustrations, for instance, of molecules are far more frequent.
In addition, it seems thatauthors of high impact journals prefer using figures to using tables probably because the informationcontent is more easily to grasp.
Tables appear to be more suited to structure information.
In a next stepwe also intend to analyze figures?
and tables?
captions with respect to comprehensiveness, i.e.
to whatextent are captions self-contained?3.1.3 Lively Writing StyleTextbook literature advices authors to formulate their contributions in an active way using active voiceand the present tense.
To learn more about present tense usage, we simply counted the occurrences ofthe respective part-of-speech tags9, i.e.
VB, VBP and VBZ.
To count occurrences of active voice, weinspected all identified verb chunks whether they contained auxiliary verbs as well as a past participlepart-of-speech tag.
If they did, we considered them passive voice otherwise active voice.
Figure 3contains average fractions of verb phrases with respect to present tense and active voice.The upper left figure in Figure 3 illustrates that authors of the physics/computer science domain use alot more present tense compared to authors from the biomedical domain.
The upper right figure indicatesthat the higher the journal?s impact factor the more present tense is used by the authors.
The lower leftfigure indicates that active and passive voice are almost evently distributed throughout article contentswith a bit passive predominance.
The lower right figure shows no significant difference of using activevoice with respect to journal quality.
There is but a trend towards using more active voice over the years.9http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?treebank/home.html51Figure 3: Illustration of average fractions of verb phrases with respect to present tense (upper figures) andactive voice (lower figures) over a ten-year period.
The left figures correspond to analyses with respectto domain and the right ones to analyses with respect to impact factor.The observed high percentage of present tense and active voice verb phrases adheres to the textbookprinciple of lively stating one?s own work.
Yet, in this analysis we took into account the tense and thevoice for the entire article content.
To address this issue in greater depth, we intend to solely analyzeabstract, introduction and conclusion in the near future.3.2 ImprecisionIn this section we examine indicators of scientific imprecision according to textbook literature including(i) number of citation bunches and (ii) number of relativating words.3.2.1 Citation BunchesStatements such as ?many people have been working in this research area?
+ a sequence of citations in-dicate lack of precision or insufficient dealing with the subject matter.
We define a collection containingmore than 3 citations as citation bunch.
Figure 4 contains average numbers of citation bunches per article.The left figure in Figure 4 indicates that citation bunches occur more often in the biomedical domainthan in the physics/computer science domain.
The right figure shows that citation bunches occur far moreoften in journals with a low impact factor than in those with a middle or high one.The findings indicate that journals with a higher impact factor contain fewer citation bunches - oneindicator of lack of precision.
Concerning the higher numbers in the biomedical domain we intend toexamine the type of scientific articles in the future; for instance, we assume that survey articles containmore citation bunches than others.52Figure 4: Illustration of averaged citation bunch counts according to domain (left) and impact factor(right)) over a ten-year period.
The y-axis corresponds to the average number of citation bunches (>3citations) per scientific article.3.2.2 Usage of Relativating WordsOverusage of relativating words10indicates lack of precision.
Reviewers may doubt an author?s expertiseand assurance of results if relativating words occur too frequently.
Figure 5 contains average numbers ofrelativating words per article sentence.Figure 5: Illustration of relativating words usage by domain (left) and by impact factor (right).
The y-axisrepresents the average number of relativating words per article sentence.The left figure in Figure 5 shows that more relativating words are used in the biomedical domain thanin the physics/computer science domain.
In the right figure journals with a high and a middle-rangedimpact factor exhibit fewer relativating words than journals with a low impact factor.The higher usage of relativating words in the biomedical domain remains unclear and might be dueto domain characteristics.
Regarding the journal quality a similar behavior as in Section 3.2.1 can beobserved: higher quality journals contain fewer relativating words - an indication for a higher scientificpreciseness and quality.4 Related WorkThe analysis of academic writing originates from research areas such as linguistics and pragmatics.These areas are rather interested in studying how scientific articles are written instead of what kind ofknowledge they contain.Discourse Analysis is a modern discipline that studies amongst other things language beyond thelevel of a sentence taking into account the surrounding contexts as well.
The detection of discoursestructure in scientific documents is important for a number of tasks such as information extraction or text10According to (Lebrun, 2007) relativating words include significantly, typically, generally, commonly, may/can, a numberof, the majority of, substantial, probably, several, less, various, frequent, many, others, more, often, most, a few, the main.53summarization.
Elements of discourse include the statement of facts, claims and hypotheses as well as theidentification of methods and protocols.
In this context (Liakata et al., 2012) automate the recognition of11 categories including Hypothesis, Motivation and Result to access the scientific discourse of scientificarticles.
In the Partridge system, (Ravenscroft et al., 2013) build upon the automated recognition toautomatically categorize articles according to their types such as Review or Case Study.
(Teufel et al.,2002) used discourse analysis to summarize scientific papers.
She restored the discourse context byadding the rhetorical status, for example, the scientific goal or criticism, to each sentence in an article.In a similar way, (Liakata et al., 2013) take scientific discourse into account to generate a content modelfor summarization purposes.Besides analyzing the structure and organisation of entire publications (cf.
(Paltridge, 2002)), thereis related literature dedicated to the analysis of single (structural) elements including (i) the title or (ii)citations.
The title is of particular importance often representing the first point of contact with the reader.
(Haggan, 2003) investigated whether titles of scientific articles could be regarded as headlines with aclear role of informing and engaging the reader.
In her work she pointed out the relation between titleformulation and information advertisement.
(Soler, 2007) conducted title studies in two genres (reviewand research papers) and in two fields (biological and social sciences).
She statistically analyzed titleswith respect to word count, word frequency and title construction.Citation analysis represents one of the most widely used methods of bibliometrics which aims to quan-titatively analyze academic literature.
Citation analysis (cf.
(Garfield, 1979)) is an expression for simplycounting a scientific article?s citations which can be regarded as indicator for an article?s scientific im-pact; the more often the article is cited, the higher its academic value (cf.
(Garfield, 1972)).
An importantpart of citation analysis represents hedge detection (cf.
(Lakoff, 1972)).
Hedges are linguistic deviceswhich indicate that authors do not or cannot back up their statements with facts.
Hedge detection, thus,supports the distinction between facts and unreliable or uncertain information (cf.
(Crompton, 1997)).Facing the continuously growing amounts of scientific articles there has been an increased interest inautomating the process (cf.
(Di Marco, 2006), (Farkas et al., 2007)).5 ConclusionOur paper?s contribution encompasses a comparison of theoretical guidelines, i.e.
?What the literaturerecommends??
with their practical implementations, i.e.
?How authors actually write scientific arti-cles??.
We designed a framework to automatically analyze ?14.000 scientific articles with respect to aselected set of writing principles.To summarize the results: Section 3.2 shows a clear relation between journal quality and imprecision,i.e.
journals with low impact factors exhibit higher numbers of imprecision indicators such as number ofcitation bunches and number of relativating words.
In addition, the number of figures and the percentageof verb phrases in present tense tend to be higher with higher quality journals (see Section 3.1).In respect to the domain, the results indicate writing style preferences probably due to domain char-acteristics, for instance, usage of more figures (see Section 3.1.2) and domain preferences, for instance,lesser usage of present tense (see Section 3.1.3).Other interesting observations include (i) that adhering to writing principles appears to be genderindependent and (ii) that using acronyms in titles is far more popular than using questions in the title (seeSection 3.1.1) independent of domain and impact factor.Our findings show that theoretical guidelines partly concur with practical implementations and thuscontribute to better understand the extent to which theory guides praxis.
A better understanding willcontribute (i) to confirm textbook principles and (ii) to update writing principles due to good practice.In a next step we plan to extend the scale of our analyses to include several hundred thousand scientificarticles as well as the complexity of our analyses to investigate issues including (i) paper skeleton, forinstance, ?Is there a prefered heading structure??
and (ii) usage of synonyms which hampers clarity.54AcknowledgementsWe thank Mendeley for providing the data set as well as Werner Klieber for crawling the PubMed dataset.
