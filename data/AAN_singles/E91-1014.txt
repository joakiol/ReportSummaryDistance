WHAT SORT OF TREES DO WE SPEAK?A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF THE SYNTAX-PROSODY INTERFACEIN TOKYO JAPANESEPete WhitelockSharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd.Neave House, Winsmore LaneAbingdon, Oxon., OX14 5UD, BritainABSTRACTWhat is the relationship between syntax,prosody and phonetics?
This paper argues for adeclarative constraint-based theory, in which eachstep in a derivation adds diverse constraints to apool.
Some of these describe well formed objects inthe feature structure domain, in terms of bothsyntactic and prosodic features.
Some characterisethe relative prominence of constituents as a partialorder over some discrete domain (playing the role ofmetrical grid).
Some are simultaneous equations inthe reals, whose solutions represent the pitch level ofphonetic objects - high and low tones.
The elementsof such a theory are illustrated with a treatment ofprosodic phrasing and tone scaling in TokyoJapanese, and the theory is compared to Selkirk andTateishi's analysis based on the Strict LayerHypothesis.INTRODUCTIONIn explorations of the relationship betweensyntax, phonology and phonetics, it is now generallyagreed that hierarchical prosodic representationsare an important organising concept.
AsPierrehumbert and Beckman (P&B, 1988), vividlyput it 'We speak trees, not strings'.
One influentialview of the geometry of ~ree representations isSelkirk's (1981) Strict Layer Hypothesis.
For Selkirkand others, prosodic structures and syntacticstructures are objects of different kinds.
Yet thenature of the mapping between them remains aquestion to which explicit, accurate and declarativeanswers have still to be formulated.This paper presents an alternative view in whichphonetic constraints are incrementally associateddirectly with syntactic derivations.
More exactly,derivations must simultaneously meet the well-formedness conditions on syntactic and prosodiclabelling, thereby guaranteeing the declarativenature of the syntax-prosody interface.
In turn,prosodic labels are associated with a set ofequational constraints on phonetic objects.
Thetheory is illustrated with a treatment of prosodicphrasing and tone scaling in standard, i.e.
Tokyo,Japanese.The possibility of equating syntactic andprosodic structure in this way follows from a view ofsyntax with two characteristics.
First, somecommonly assumed syntactic constituents whichnever correspond to prosodic units are insufficientlymotivated, so such constructions are given analternative syntactic analysis which respectsprosodic onstituency.
Secondly, the derivation of anexpression with a given semantic interpretation, andhence its prosodic structure, may be systematicallyunder-determined by that interpretation.
Syntacticstructure is thus at least partly motivated byprosodic data, in accord with the concrete view ofsyntax presupposed in constraint-based grammars.Conversely, the results of Kubozono's (1987)careful phonetic experiments point to the existenceof prosodic structures that are organised recursivelyand in other ways incompatible with the Strict LayerAssumption.
Distinctions in syntactic onstituencywhich have been argued to be unimportant forprosodic phrasing do appear to have clear phoneticexponents under controlled conditions, weakeningthe argument for autonomous prosodic structures.The paper is organised as follows.
The elementsof the syntactic model used in the analysis ofJapanese are presented.
We then approach thesyntax-prosody interface from the opposite nd, andlook at the prosodic phonetics of Japaneseutterances, trying to classify features of pitchcontours.
First, several relatively uncontroversialelements in the phonology of Japanese prosody arediscussed - the minor phrase, the accentual andphrasal tones, declination and downstep.
Then theStrict Layer Hypothesis and its application to minorphrasing and tone scaling are considered.
Data fromKubozono (1987) is introduced to argue instead forthe theory assumed here, and a preliminarytreatment is presented.A CATEGORIAL UNIF ICATION APPROACHTO JAPANESEI will identify the fundamental unit of Japanesesyntax with the traditional category~ bunsetsu(phrase), comprising an open-class "item with- 75  ?cliticised closed-class affixes.
The open class lexicalitems are broadly classifiable as nouns and verbs.
Asdescribed in Whitelock (1987), the closed-classitems may be classified in two orthogonaldimensions.
First, they form phrases with items of acertain category.
Second, they indicate that such aphrase stands in some syntactic relationship (e.g.subject, modifier) to another phrase with a certaincategory.
Thus the phrases of the language fall intothe following four categories:nominal - adverbial, e.g.keiko ni (Keiko-DAT), genki ni (healthily)nominal - adnominalkeiko no (Keiko-GEN), g~nki na (healthy)verbal - adverbialwaratte (laugh-and), amaku (sweetly)verbal - adnominalwarau (that laughs), amakatta (that was sweet)The bunsetsu generally behaves as a prosodicunit.
Although the syntactic structure of a phraselike (1) is generally taken to be as in (la), its prosodicstructure must be as in (lb).
(i) Naoko  no ant noNaoko 's  b ro ther  's(la) \ [ \ [ \ [Naoko no\] ant\] no\](ib) \ [ \ [Naoko no\] \[ant no\]\]Proposals  to handle such 'bracket ingparadoxes' have been made within the framework ofextended Categorial Grammar (e.g.
Moortgat, 1989).We will assume a Categorial Unification Grammar(CUG) (Uszkoreit (1986), Kartunnen (1987)).Whereas an extended CG might capture thepolymorphism of a bunsetsu by the derivation stepof type-raising, in CUG it may be representedsimultaneously by the use of multiple features in thecomplex categories.
Syntactic bracketings uch asthat shown in (la) are never assigned.Each complex category or sign includes a set ofse l f  features, plus the sign-valued featuresargument  and resu l t ,  which together with ad i rec t ion  constitute a funct ion .
The relevantstructure of a typical sign, for the bunsetsu keiko hi,is shown in (2).
(2) se l f : \ [ l \ ] ca t :nfunct ion :arg :  \ [2 \ ]se l f :cat :sd i r : r ightres: \ [2 \ ]se l f : iob j : \ [ l \ ]This sign says 'if a functor is looking for me, itprobably needs to know I'm a noun.
But 1 am also afunction from a sentence of which I am the indirectobject into itself'.
Note the assumption that well-formedness of the functional representations (i.e.those which include subj, obj etc.)
is independentlycharacterised (cf.
Coherence and Completeness inLFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982)).
This leads to amassive simplification in the combinatorial syntax.Karttunen (1987) proposes a similar treatment forFinnish.
Furthermore, I treat free verb forms as S, anapproach motivated by the zero-pronominalproperty of Japanese (see Whitelock 1991 for furtherdetails).
Also note, contra other work in extended CG(e.g.
Barry and Pickering (1990)), that thisformulat ion identi f ies the funct ion  in acombination with the dependent  in a functionaldependency representation, and the argument withthe head.The syntactic rules define three ways of buildingsigns.
(3) shows rule A (essentially functionapplication) in PATR-II notation.
(3) M --) D,H (A)<D funct ion  d i r> = r ight<D funct ion  arg> = H<D funct ion  res> = MThe backward version of this rule (L) is the ruleof morphological combination.
Unlike a syntacticfunctor, a morphological functor, i.e.
an affix, willtypically have quite distinct values of <function arg>and <function result>.The chaining rule (C) in (4) constructs the?
mother sign with self features from the functor sign?
rather than the result sign.
(4) M --) D ,H  (C)<D funct ion  d i r> = r ight<D funct ion  arg> = H<D funct ion  res funct ion>= <M funct ion><D sel f> = <M se l f>Finally, the merging rule (M) in (5) combinestwo functors looking for the same argument:(5) M --) D1 , D2 (M)<DI functor> = <D2 functor><DI functor> = <M functor><M sel f> = ni lThough the details are specific to Japanese, it ispossible to develop rules of these types for other76 -languages.
Like an extended CG, but unlike theLambek calculus, CUG is not structurally complete(i.e.
not every substring may be given an analysis).Merging and chaining both correspondapproximately to composition in extended CG.However, the CUG formulation brings out theessential difference between them.
A constituentbuilt by chaining represents a head lacking adependent, while merging combines dependentslacking a head.
Their effect on derivation dependson the headedness of the language concerned.
Themain effects are summarised in Fig.

EquivalenceThe important aspects of this model are asfollows.
First, all structures are directly generated bythe grammar.
The <=> is not a rule for deriving onestructure from another.
Secondly, the branchingstructure may be sensitive tO constraints other thansemantic ones.
In particular, applicatively right-branching structures may be given alternative,psychologically more plausible, analyses.
Suchanalyses are useful in modell ing intonationphenomena such as the prosodic bracketing ofEnglish phrases like (6) (generated using the EnglishChain rule), whose applicative bracketing is given in(6a).

A minor phrase shows exactly one pitchpeak; in this utterance, the minor phrasescorrespond exactly to bunsetsu.

3b Tones and AccentFig.
3b draws attention to the distinction inshape between the first and the latter two minorphrases.
The steep drop in pitch from ma to i inumai ,  and from mi to m?
in nomimono,  representsthe pitch accent proper.
The presence and locationof a pitch accent is a lexical property, and its shape isfixed.
In contrast, he gentle fall covering 'the rewa ofsorewa is a result of sore's lexical specification asunaccented.
In such cases, a lower pitch peak thanthe accented one is realised early in-the minorphrase.
In fact, in minor phrases with a late accent,this early peak is also distinguishable, so this"phrasal' tone can be assumed present in all minorphrases.
Note the phonetic justification of thisprosodic category as the domain of high tonelinking.- 77  -The diagram is annotated according to thenotation of Pierrehumbert (1980).
The pitch accent isrepresented as a sequence of tones, here H+L, withthe tone that is aligned with the text marked *, henceH*+L.
The L tone of the accent is aligned withrespect to this.
The phrasal H tone and the boundaryL tones, L%, are also shown.
P&B clearlydemonstrate hat their sparse tone model, built frompitch accents, phrasal H tones and boundary Ltones, is superior to the standard Autosegmentalaccount (e.g.
Haraguchi, 1977), where each mora hasa fully specified tone.
Their careful phoneticexperiments show that pitch is a simpleinterpolation between certain critical points.In this paper, the alignment of tones will not beconsidered.
In English, the repertoire of pitchaccents leads to phrases with a variety of tunes,including alignment contrasts uch as that betweenH+L* and H*+L.
But in Japanese, the tunes arerestricted to the ones in (8).
(8) (L%) H (L%) unaccented(L%) H H*+L (L%) accentedI have bracketed the boundary tones at bothends to indicate that they belong to both precedingand following phrases - they are ambiphrasal.
Moreexactly, I treat a boundary tone between two minorphrases as a property of the major phrase whichdominates both of them, though I don't discuss L-tone scaling in the paper.In fig.
3c, the overall downward slope of the pitchtrace is picked out.
Such a slope, about 10Hz/sec, isoften cited as an intonational universal and linked tophysiological properties of the speech system.Experiments demonstrate that the second of twoequal tones is typically perceived as higher.
Thisphonetic property, declination, must be clearlydistinguished from the phonological propertydownstep or catathesis, as also illustrated in fig.

3c Declination and DownstepThe pitch difference between the accent Htones of the last two phrases is significantly greaterthan can be accounted for by declination alone.Several authors (Poser, 1987, P&B, Kubozono) havedemonstrated that this effect occurs preciselybecause an accent lowers all tones in a subsequentphrase.
P&B quantify the fact of downstep with aspeaker specific constant c, (,, 0.5, in a pitch rangenormalised to 1).
In effect, a tone in a phrasefollowing an accented phrase is c times the height itwould be following an unaccented phrase.
Theprosodic category major phrase is justifiedphonetically as the domain of downstep; the precisecharacter of major phrases is a point at issue in thispaper.so  re  wa  u ma i no  mi  me noFig.

?Each local tree in a prosodic representation islicensed by a phrase structure rule of the formHi "-~ Hi - l " ,  for  i E 1 .. n .
Thus  a category of onetype dominates all and only the categories of oneother type, and prosodic trees are fixed in depth andn-ary branching.Acceding to Selkirk and Tateishi (S&T, 1989) thesyntax-prosody mapping is then defined byassociating with each II b i E 0 .. n, a parameter pairof the form:< edge,  xbar>, edge E {left,right},bar E BAR, i.e.
{lex, max, ...}- 78  -The parameter settings entail that a prosodicboundary between constituents of category H i mustcoincide with the edge of a syntactic onstituent ofcategory X bar  .

4 Minor Phrasing (S&T)It is not easy to give such a straightforwardaccount of minor phrasing.
Under certaincircumstances, a sequence Of two bunsetsu may berealised as a single minor phrase.
For S&T bunsetsuis never a syntactic ategory, but rather appears asthe prosodic category word (0)).
It is the prosodicword rather than the minor phrase which has theparameter setting, in this case X lex.
So an upcominglexical item must initiate a prosodic word, but may ormay not initiate a minor phrase.
The analysis issummarised in fig.
4.
One slight methodologicalproblem is that the prosodic word has no phoneticjustification.In the alternative analysis pursued here, twoboolean-valued features major and minor are usedto prosodically classify syntactic constituents.
Asingle constituent may not be both <minor +> and<major +>, though it may be neither.
Each of thesefeature speci f icat ions is associated withcharacteristic phonetic equations.
A constituentlabelled <minor +> will contribute a constraint thatrelates the pitch of the H tones to the value of aregister.
A constituent labelled <major +> willcontribute two sets of constraints - over the relativevalues of its daughter's registers, and on the pitch ofthe intermediate L% tones.
These constraints arediscussed below.The admissible prosodic labellings are definedas those which extend the following prosodic rules.in (9) (+(~), the mother is constrained to be a majorphrase, while in (10) (-4~), the mother is constrainednot to be a major phrase, though it may or may notbe a minor phrase.

5 A problem for SLHS&T assume that a minor phrase boundary maynever appear within a bunsetsu (?0).

In addition, anaccented element is higher than an unaccented one(this is true of previous L% tones as well as H tones).We associate with the prosodic rule +(~ a scalingequation as in (11):(ii) Mother  -~ Left R ight  (+?
)<Right  reg is te r> =f (<Left register>,<Right  downstep>)If the values of these features are real,normalised to speaker ange, and f is multiplication,this treatment is very similar to P&Bs.
I assume thefeature <Right downstep> takes the values d n (n >0), where n is the number of downstepping tones inLeft and d is the speaker specific constant (<1) thatdetermines the quantitative aspects of downstep.For each constituent Phrase labelled <minor+>, a set of equations as in (12) is added to theconstraint pool:(12) <Phrase  accent  p i tch> =<Phrase  reg is ter><Phrase  phrasa l  h igh p i tch> =g(<Phrase  register>,u)This continues to follow P&B (with g =multiplication) and u (<1) a speaker constantrepresenting the ratio of phrasal to accent high.Three-e lement  phrases: Kubozono considersthree element phrases and contrasts the intonationof those with right and left branching applicativestructures.
For instance, fig.

Thedifference between the second peaks in the twostructures is significant at < 1%, the differencebetween the third at <.1%.

6 Three-element PhrasesTo describe this, I assign a metrical abelling toa derivation.
I assume that contra English, theprimary phonetic exponent of such labelling inJapanese is pitch, that is, the H tones in strongerconstituents are higher.
The labelling associatedwith the A (and C) rule is as follows:In a s t ruc ture  of the form:\[A X Y\] or \[C X Y\]Y is s t rong iff it b ranchesThis gives the following labellings for the trees infig.
6.a) \[W IS S WI\] b) \[Is S W\] W\]Labelling rules may of course be overridden bydiscourse factors.
Space precludes a detaileddescription of prominence projection, that is, thecorrelation of metrical labelling with discreteterminal grid values.
Note that the standardLiberman and Prince convention equates the gridvalues of the last element in the two cases, in conflictwith the data.
One formulation would assume afeature, say prominence,  which takes the values 1or p (>1) as a constituent is labelled W or S.Downstepping and prominence interact, with theformulation in (14) replacing that given in (11) above:(14) <Right  reg is te r> =f (<Left  reg is ter>,<Right  downstep>,<Right  prominence>)<Left  reg is te r> = <Mother  reg is ter>Note that the register of a constituent is that ofits left daughter.
If the entire phrase is given theregister value 1, and f is multi-plication, the hightones in fig.
6 receive the following pitch values.Right -branch ing  caseH2 = HI * d * p = d * pH3 = H2 * d = d 2 * pLe f t -b ranch ing  caseH2 = HI * d * 1 = dH3 = HI * d 2 * 1 = d 2- 80  .These figures capture the fact that both secondand third elements in the right-branching structure~re boosted with respect to their left-branchingcounterparts.S&T's data shows the same effect as that ofKubozono in fig.
6.
Their analysis is schematised infig.
7.
The difference between the two cases followsfrom the binary opposition downstep/no downstep.However, this analysis is no longer supported bySelkirk (p.c.
), following Kubozono's clear demon-stration that downstep does apply in right-branchingphrases.
If the first element of a right branchingphrase is unaccented, the second element is evenhigher.V V~ = downstep ~= no downstepFig.
7 Three-Element Phrases (S&T)Four-element phrases: When we turn to four-element phrases, we find further evidence fori~ecursively structured prosodic domains.
Fig.
8summarises Kubozono's data.
All trees representapplicative structures.
In structures 1 and 2, the firsttwo elements are a dependent and its head,indisputibly a constituent.
In structures 3 and 4, thefirst two elements are dependents of the same head.This is a non-standard constituent built by theMerge rule.
Syntactically, such a constituentappears in coordinate sentence constructions with"gapped' pre-final verbs.
Finally, in structure 5, thefirst two elements do not form a syntactic onstituentof any sort, being a head and the dependent of~iifferent head.These functional equivalence classes correlateclosely with the relative heights of the two pitchpeaks - -  the tighter the connection between the twoelements, the lower the second peak.
This accountcompares favourably with other theories that onlypostulate one such relationship, such as Lambekgrammar where every pair of phrases is a~:onstituent, or those with two, such as phrase-8~ructure grammar, or Barry and Pickering's (1990)ve~'sion of Lambek with dependency and non-~ependency onstituents.However, in principle Barry and Pickering'smodel could generalise as follows.
They characteriseany string whose analysis involves abstraction over afunction symbol as a non-dependency onstituent.But as many further distinctions as the data warrantsmay be made by considering the number of functorsabstracted over.
Kubozono's data for four-elementphrases supports the case for at least threedistinctions (no functor abstraction, one, more thanone).
Whether further distinctions need to besupported is unclear, as the systematic phoneticexploration of five-element phrases has yet to becarried out.Fig.

However, a similar modelhas been argued for by Briscoe (pc) on the basis ofEnglish.The model has been implemented in a Prologversion of PATR-II augmented with a simultaneousequation solver.
Most of the data given above havebeen described with varying degrees of accuracy.Formulating and testing the predictions of diversehypotheses with the system is easy due to the basicgenerative approach.
Further cycles of phoneticexperiments and modelling of the results areneeded to distinguish between alternative analysesand refine the accuracy of the model.-81  -If this early exploration turns out to be on theright track, and it is indeed possible to describe theprosodic properties of speech within an integrateddeclarative model of grammar, then future speechsynthesis ystems will be able to exploit diverseinformation on-line in the generation of naturalintonation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was carried out while I was a visitingfellow at the Centre for Cognitive Science, Universityof Edinburgh.
