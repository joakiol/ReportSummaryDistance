Because the words relevantto short- and medium-term interest rates differ,we apply a supervised approach to learn dis-tinct sets of topics for each dependent variablebeing examined.
We generate predictions withand without controlling for factors relevant tointerest rate movements, and our predictionresults average across multiple training-testsplits.
Using data from 1999-2016, we achieve93% and 64% accuracy in predicting Targetand Effective Federal Funds Rate movementsand 38%-40% accuracy in predicting longerterm Treasury Rate movements.
We obtainlower but comparable accuracies after control-ling for other macroeconomic and market fac-tors.1 IntroductionThis study uses the verbal content of Federal OpenMarket Committee (FOMC) public communicationsto predict the directions of interest rate movementson the days those communications are released.
TheFOMC, who determines government policies rel-evant to interest rates, meets roughly eight timesa year and releases a statement after each meet-ing.
The FOMC is known to be an importantmover of markets, and economic research has foundthat equity and interest rate markets tend to movewhen FOMC communications are released (Farkaand Fleissig, 2012; Gu?rkaynak et al, 2005; Mueller,2015; Rosa, 2011) that the policy actions alone donot explain these responses (and thus the contentof the text must be responsible) (Gu?rkaynak et al,2005), and that the directions of market movementscoincide with a human-coded measure of the sen-timent expressed in the texts (Rosa, 2011).
Writ-ers in the finance industry and in the popular presshave also examined word clouds of FOMC min-utes (Cofnas, 2010; Durden, 2011) and have dis-cussed the market implications of the total numberof words included in FOMC minutes (Fitz-gerald,2014; Kennedy, 2014; Wynne, 2013).A growing body of research applies NLP meth-ods to understand the market effects from the con-tents of these texts.
Researchers have applied La-tent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to describe the keytopics covered in FOMC minutes, obtaining insightsinto the FOMC?s deliberation process (Hansen et al,2015; Fligstein et al, 2014; Schonhardt, 2013).
Ad-ditionally, researchers have used NLP-derived mea-sures of the content of FOMC minutes to predictequity and interest rate volatilities; (Boukus andRosenberg, 2006) use LSA-defined topics in a re-gression context, and (Zadeh and Zollman, 2009)apply a dependency-based measure of text content toan expert-classified set of financially relevant wordsand then use both regression and SVM to predictvolatility.
Papers have found temporary effects ofthe sentiments from company-specific news articlesand message board postings on stock prices andvolatility, company earnings, and trading volumes,using dictionary-based sentiment measures (Davis etal., 2012; Tetlock, 2007; Tetlock et al, 2007; Tet-lock, 2011) as well as sentiment measures that aretrained on a human-classified subsample (Antweiler2096and Frank, 2004, 2006; Das and Chen, 2007).1 Stud-ies have found temporary effects even when infor-mation is ?stale?
(Tetlock, 2011) and also that short-sales precede negative news (Fox et al, 2009/2010).Researchers also find that the readability of corpo-rate filings is positively associated with earnings andthe precision of analysts?
forecasts about the com-pany (Li, 2008; Lehavy et al, 2011).The current study builds upon this literature byexamining a somewhat different question than pre-vious researchers do and by applying a different setof techniques that are particularly well-suited formeasuring the market effects of texts.
Rather thanexamine the texts?
effects on volatility, which in-creases in response to both positive and negativesentiments, we predict the direction in which interestrates move, which is the focus of market participantsas well as the FOMC texts themselves.2 The ques-tion we ask is also somewhat different than that ex-amined in the literature because we analyze the rel-atively short FOMC statements that are released im-mediately following the meetings?and contain thekey market-moving content (Gu?rkaynak et al, 2005;Mueller, 2015)?rather than on the lengthier min-utes that have more text to analyze but are only re-leased after the key information from the statementshas been available for three weeks.In addition to making contributions specific to ourapplication, this study highlights methods that areparticularly useful for measuring the market effectsof text content.
FOMC communications are knownto provide distinct information about short- versusmedium- or long-term policies (Gu?rkaynak et al,2005).
We consequently use MedLDA (Zhu et al2009), a supervised topic model, to learn separatelythe sets of words that are most predictive of move-ments in short- and medium-term interest rates3Through this supervised topic model, we generate1While not examining market data, (Chua et al, 2009)also examines the problem of classifying sentiment in messageboard postings.2A related study has applied LDA to measure the impactson returns and volatility of communications from the Bank ofCanada (Hendry and Madeley, 2010).3Other classification methods that we attempted but found tobe less effective include regression of rate movements on wordcount, logit estimation on the frequencies of the most commonwords, and k-nearest neighbor estimation using a word2vecsimilarity measure (Mikolov, 2013).topics, based upon context (which words appear to-gether) as well as co-movement with the outcomevariables being studied.
Hence, the varies dependingupon which dependent variable is being considered.Second, we address possible bias from one impor-tant set of omitted variables?releases of macroeco-nomic data, as discussed by (Rosa, 2011)?by esti-mating specifications in which we control for thosefactors separately and predict whether interest ratesmoved more or less than would be expected basedupon the latest data on the macroeconomic environ-ment.
By examining an immediate market responseto the publication of text and controlling for poten-tial confounding factors, this study demonstrates oneway in which NLP approaches, in addition to theirvalue in classifying text content, can be applied toestimate statements?
causal effects.
We control forthe effects of macroeconomic data and time-specificfactors like day-of-week effects and time trends us-ing only observations from non-FOMC dates, so thatwe do not lose degrees of freedom in our estima-tion.
Third, unlike Boukus and Rosenberg (2006)and Hendry and Madeley (2010) but similarly toZadeh and Zollman (2009), we split the sample intotraining and test sets in order to limit overfitting inour predicted values.
Zadeh and Zollman (2009)use data from 1967-2000 as a training set, and thenthey test their model on data from 2001-2008.
Giventhe importance of context in predicting interest ratemovements, we instead restrict our sample to ob-servations from meetings from May 1999 to May20164.
Because autocorrelation in our dependentvariables is relatively limited, we treat the observa-tions as independent and, among observations in oursample, average our test performance across multi-ple training-test splits.2 Market Effects of Text Content2.1 Overview of Text ContentFOMC statements contain information about manyaspects of the economy, including interest rates, themoney supply, inflation, unemployment, and eco-nomic growth.
These communications are highlyrepetitive, often containing nearly identical sen-tences and sentence structures from previous meet-4May 1999 was the date of the last major redesign of theFOMC statements2097ings.
Slight changes in the wordings are known tohave major effects on markets (Gu?rkaynak et al,2005).Pre-processing of text: In order to convert the textinto a format that can be easily processed, we per-form several cleaning operations to the texts.
Non-alphabetic characters are removed, and the texts areconverted to lower case.
Each document is separatedinto a bag of words, and common words (e.g., mrand federal) and stop words are deleted using thestopwords list from nltk.corpus in Python.
Wordsare stemmed using the Porter stemming algorithm(stem from stemming.porter2 in Python), and one-letter words are dropped.2.2 MedLDALDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) (Blei et al,2003) is an unsupervised model, whereas super-vised topic model (sLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe,2007) introduces a response variable to LDA foreach document.
Max-Entropy Discrimination LDA(MedLDA) (Zhu et al 2009) is max-margin variantof the supervised topic models.
MedLDA can bebuilt for both regression and classification predictiontasks.
In this study we employed the model built forclassification task.
For classification, the responsevariables y are discrete having values {1, 0,?1} de-noting the movements of the interest rates.
Hence,we consider the multi-class classification version ofthe MedLDA.
It is defined based on a Support VectorMachine (SVM), which integrates the max-marginprinciple with an underlying LDA model for top-ics.
Formally, the probabiltiies associated with max-entropy discrimination topic models (MedTM) canbe generally defined as:mindL(q(H)) +KL(q(?)||pp(?))
+ U(?)
(1)where H are hidden variables (e.g., (?, z) in LDA);are the parameters of the model pertaining to the pre-diction task (e.g., ?
in sLDA); ?
are the parametersof the underlying topic model (e.g., the Dirichlet pa-rameter ?
); and L is a variational upper bound ofthe negative log likelihood associated with the un-derlying topic model.
U is a convex function overslack variables.
For the general MedTM model, wecan develop a similar variational EM-algorithm asfor the MedLDA.We apply the MedLDA model on the FOMCdocuments and considering the interest rates as theresponse variables (y) to compute topics that areclosely related to variations in the interest rates.Eventually these topics are used to classify changesin the rates using the max-margin classifier embed-ded in the MedLDA model.2.3 Controlling for MacroeconomicInformationIn addition to these text-based data, we supply ourclassifier with ?control?
variables describing thelatest releases of macroeconomic variables.
Themacroeconomic data considered in this analysis arethree of the most important measures of US eco-nomic health: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) usedto measure inflation, Unemployment, and real an-nualized growth in the US Gross Domestic Product(GDP).
The values for all three of these statistics arepublicly released on a monthly basis.
The CPI andUnemployment numbers are measured on a monthlybasis and are typically not updated from their ini-tially released values.
The CPI data are typically re-leased between 15 and 20 days after the end of themonth, and the Unemployment data are typically re-leased 6 to 10 days after the end of the month.
GDPis measured on a quarterly basis, and three estimatesare provided: ?advance,?
?preliminary?
or ?second,?and ?final?
or ?third,?
which are released about one,two, and three months after the end of the quarter, re-spectively.
The final GDP numbers are occasionallyrevised in later releases.
Our release date data andsome of the macroeconomic statistics were obtainedfrom direct requests to the U.S. Bureau of EconomicAnalysis (B. of Econ.
An.
(a), 2015; B. of Econ.An.
(b), 2015) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Stats(B. of Lab.

Additional data on the GDP and unemploy-ment numbers released were obtained from publicsources (Econ.

(a), 15).If macroeconomic information is released on thesame day as an FOMC communication, it is possi-ble that this release could influence both the contentof the FOMC statement as well as the interest ratemovements that day.
To avoid that possibility, weimplement a modified MedLDA approach using adependent variable that is ?purged?
of these poten-tially confounding influences.
In some of our speci-2098Table 1: Accuracy of Medlda Classifier after purging out of control for statements between 1999 and May, 2016 [K (topics) = 20]Outcome variable MedLDA Baseline (Random Chance)5None Linear Interactions None Linear InteractionsTarget Fed Funds Rate 0.9321 0.9160 0.8954 0.6849 0.6849 0.6849Effective Fed Funds Rate 0.6421 0.4479 0.5112 0.4589 0.4658 0.4658Median Treasury Rate 0.4209 0.3803 0.4012 0.4589 0.4247 0.4247Average Treasury Rate 0.3803 0.4611 0.3924 0.4726 0.4041 0.4041fications, we first regress the interest rate movementsof interest on these macroeconomic indicators.
Ourmain set of controls includes the latest values for themost recent two values of the unemployment rate,GDP growth rate, and CPI inflation rate and theirchanges, a daily time trend, and year, month, andday-of-the-week dummies.
Some specifications usethis set, and others add the full set of two-way inter-actions across these different variables.
For both themain and the interacted set, we regress the changein the rate of interest on the full set of controls forthe full set of non-FOMC dates from May 1999through May 2016.
Hence, we estimate the rela-tionship between interest rate movements and the re-leases of macroeconomic data using dates in whichFOMC statements or minutes were not released.
Us-ing the coefficients from these regressions, we gen-erate residuals of interest rate movements for theFOMC dates and then create indicators for whetherthe residual was positive or negative for that interestrate movement on that FOMC date.3 Empirical ResultsWe randomly split the data, containing 146 datapoints (FOMC statements and corresponding move-ments in the interest rates from May 1999 throughMay 2016) into a a 80-20% train-test set split tocompute the accuracy of the model to predict themovement.
For each experiment, we varied thenumber of topics (K) to see which value of K isgiving the best accuracy.
In most cases, the best ac-curacy is given by K = 20.
The results presented inTable 1 shows the average accuracies of predictingthe movements of the interest rates after purging theoutcome variables out of control.
The presented ac-curacies are the results of 20 fold validation.
Whenno controls are used, our accuracy is 93% and 64%for the Target and Effective Federal Funds Rates(both better than random chance) and 42% and 38%for the Median and Average Treasury Rates6 Thespecifications with control variables have similar butsomewhat lower accuracy rates.
Hence, our text-mining approach is comparable in effectiveness atmeasuring whether interest rates moved more or lessthan expected, after controlling for the economic en-vironment, than it is at predicting the raw directionsof movement.
MedLDA model is compared againsta simple baseline.
The baseline is the accuracy, if theinterest rate movements are randomly guessed fromthe prior distribution of each of the interest rates un-der the different controls.
For the Target and Ef-fective rates, the MedLDA model outperforms thebaseline with a great margin and for the Median andAverage rate, the performance is slightly poorer.The high target rate prediction accuracy suggeststhat the MedLDA model can effectively associatethe text contents of the meetings with the move-ments in the rate, even though the numeric valuesare dropped from the text.
Similar arguments can beapplied to the effective rate prediction.
On the otherhand, treasury rates are not directly connected to thetext of the FOMC statements, so the factors influenc-ing these rates are not present or mentioned in thetext.
Thus, to have a better prediction accuracies forthese variables information from other sources arenecessary which is beyond the scope of this paper.However, the present FOMC meeting might give anindication to future FOMC plans and thus, to the5Our random chance baseline is a classifier that always se-lects the most likely of the three outcomes (increase, decrease,or no change) based upon their frequencies in the full dataset.6Median Treasury Rate is the median of the -1, 0, and 1 clas-sifications among the movements of the 3m, 1y, 3y, 5y, and 10yTreasury Rates.
Average Treasury Rate is the -1/0/1 classifica-tion of the average of those rates.2099treasury rates.
Hence, the prediction accuracies arenot much worse than the baseline.4 ConclusionThis study measures the effects of text-based infor-mation released by the FOMC on daily interest ratemovements.
We used the medLDA model on a setof 146 docs and obtain accuracies of 93% and 64%in predicting the Federal Funds Target Rate and theEffective Rate.ReferencesWerner Antweiler and Murray Z. Frank.
