JU_CSE_GREC10: Named Entity Generation at GREC 2010Amitava Das1, Tanik Saikh2, Tapabrata Mondal3, Sivaji Bandyopadhyay4Department of Computer Science and EngineeringJadavpur University,Kolkata-700032, Indiaamitava.santu@gmail.com1, tanik4u@gmail.com2, tapabratamon-dal@gmail.com3, sivaji_cse_ju@yahoo.com4AbstractThis paper presents the experiments carriedout at Jadavpur University as part of the par-ticipation in the GREC Named Entity Genera-tion Challenge 2010.
The Baseline system isbased on the SEMCAT, SYNCAT and SYN-FUNC features of REF and REG08-TYPE andCASE features of REFEX elements.
The dis-course level system is based on the additionalpositional features: paragraph number, sen-tence number, word position in the sentenceand mention number of a particular named ent-ity in the document.
The inclusion of discourselevel features has improved the performanceof the system.1 Baseline SystemThe baseline system is based on the followinglinguistic features of REF elements: SEMCAT(Semantic Category), SYNCAT (Syntactic Cate-gory) and SYNFUNC (Syntactic Function) (AnjaBelz, 2010) and the following linguistic featuresof REFEX elements: REG08-TYPE (Entity type)and CASE (Case marker).
The baseline systemhas been separately trained on the training setdata for the three domains: chefs, composers andinventors.
The system has been tested on eachdevelopment set by identifying the most probableREFEX element among the possible alternativesbased on the REF element feature combination.The probability assigned to a REFEX elementcorresponding to a certain feature combination ofREF element is calculated as follows:( )iiDREFEXv DREFNp RN=where ( )vp R is the probability of the targetedREFEX element to be assigned, iDREFN is the totalnumber of occurrences of REF element featurecombinations, iD denotes the domain i.e., Chefs,Composers and Inventors and iDREFN denotes thetotal number of occurrences of the REFEX ele-ment corresponding to the REF feature combina-tion.It has been observed that many times the mostprobable REFEX element as identified from thetraining set is not present among the alternativeREFEX elements.
In these cases the system as-signs the next highest probable REFEX elementlearnt from the training set that matches with oneof the REFEX elements among the alternatives.In some cases more than one REFEX element getsame probability in the training set.
In these cas-es, the REFEX element that occurs earlier in thealternative set is assigned.
The experimental re-sult of Baseline system is reported in Table 1.Chefs Composers InventorsPrecision 0.63 0.68 0.70Recall 0.69 0.60 0.64F-Measure 0.66 0.64 0.68Table 1: Result of Baseline System2 Discourse Level SystemThe discourse level features like paragraph num-ber, sentence number and position of a particularword in a sentence have been added with the fea-tures considered in the baseline system.
As men-tioned in Section 1, more than one REFEX ele-ment can have the same probability value.
Thishappens as REFEX elements are identified bytwo features only REG08-TYPE and CASE.NamePro-nounCom-monEmp-tyChefs 2317 3071 55 646Composers 2616 4037 92 858Inventors 1959 2826 75 621Table 2: Distribution of REFEX Types amongthree domains.The above problem occurs mainly for Nametype.
Pronouns are very frequent in all the threedomains but they have small number of varia-tions as: he, her, him, himself, his, she, who,whom and whose.
Common type REFEX ele-ments are too infrequent in the training set andthey are very hard to generalize.
Empty type hasonly one REFEX value as: ?_?.
The distributionof the various REFEX types among the threedomains in the training set is shown in Table 2.2.1 Analysis of Name type entitiesTable 2 shows that name types are very frequentin all the three domains.
Name type entities arefurther differentiated by adding more featuresderived from the analysis of the name type ele-ment.Firstly, the full name of each named entity hasbeen identified by Entity identification number(id), maximum length among all occurrences ofthat named entity and case marker as plain.
Forexample, in Figure 1, the REFEX element of id 3has been chosen as a full name of entity ?0?
as ithas the longest string with case ?plain?.After identification of full name of each RE-FEX entity, the following features are identifiedfor each occurrence of an entity:: CompleteName Genitive (CNG), Complete Name (CN),First Name Genitive (FNG), First Name (FN),Last Name Genitive (LNG), Last Name (LN),Middle Name Genitive (MNG) and MiddleName (MN).
These features are binary in natureand for each occurrence of an entity only one ofthe above features will be true.Pronouns are kept as the REFEX element fea-ture with its surface level pattern as they haveonly 9 variations.
Common types are consideredwith tag level ?common?
as they hard to general-ize.
Empty types are tagged as ?empty?
as theyhave only one tag value ?_?.1<REFEX ENTITY="0" REG08-TYPE="name" CASE="genitive">AlainSenderens's</REFEX>CNG2<REFEX ENTITY="0" REG08-TYPE="name"CASE="genitive">Senderens's</REFEX>LNG3<REFEX ENTITY="0" REG08-TYPE="name" CASE="plain">AlainSenderens</REFEX>CN4<REFEX ENTITY="0" REG08-TYPE="name"CASE="plain">Senderens</REFEX>LNFigure 1: Example of Full Name Identification3 Experimental ResultsThe experimental results of the discourse levelsystem on the development set are reported in theTable 3 and Table 4 respectively.
Table 3 reportsthe results when the system has been trained sep-arately with domain specific training set and Ta-ble 4 reports the results when the training hasbeen carried out on the complete training set.The comparison of the results of the baselineand the discourse level system shows an overallimprovement.
But there are some interesting ob-servations when comparing the results in Table 3and Table 4.
