Thestudy was mainly focused on disambigu-ating schwa-/\/ and /a/ vowel epenthesisfor consonants, which is one of the sig-nificant problems found in Sinhala.
Thisproblem has been addressed by formulat-ing a set of rules.
The proposed set ofrules was tested using 30,000 distinctwords obtained from a corpus and com-pared with the same words manuallytranscribed to phonemes by an expert.The Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) con-version model achieves 98 % accuracy.1 IntroductionThe conversion of Text-to-Speech (TTS) in-volves many important processes.
These proc-esses can be divided mainly in to three parts; textanalysis, linguistic analysis and waveform gen-eration (Black and Lenzo, 2003).
The text analy-sis process is responsible for converting the non-textual content into text.
This process also in-volves tokenization and normalization of thetext.
The identification of words or chunks oftext is called text-tokenization.
Text normaliza-tion establishes the correct interpretation of theinput text by expanding the abbreviations andacronyms.
This is done by replacing the non-alphabetic characters, numbers, and punctuationwith appropriate text strings depending on thecontext.
The linguistic analysis process involvesfinding the correct pronunciation of words, andassigning prosodic features (eg.
phrasing, intona-tion, stress) to the phonemic string to be spoken.The final process of a TTS system is waveformgeneration which involves the production of anacoustic digital signal using a particular synthesisapproach such as formant synthesis, articulatorysynthesis or waveform concatenation (Lemmetty,1999).
The text analysis and linguistic analysisprocesses together are known as the NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) component, whilethe waveform generation process is known as theDigital Signal Processing (DSP) component of aTTS System (Dutoit, 1997).Finding correct pronunciation for a givenword is one of the first and most significant tasksin the linguistic analysis process.
The componentwhich is responsible for this task in a TTS sys-tem is often named the Grapheme-To-Phoneme(G2P), Text-to-Phone or Letter-To-Sound (LTS)conversion module.
This module accepts a wordand generates the corresponding phonemic tran-scription.
Further, this phonemic transcriptioncan be annotated with appropriate prosodicmarkers (Syllables, Accents, Stress etc) as well.In this paper, we describe the implementationand evaluation of a G2P conversion model for aSinhala TTS system.
A Sinhala TTS system isbeing developed based on Festival, the opensource speech synthesis framework.
Letter tosound conversion for Sinhala usually has simpleone to one mapping between orthography andphonemic transcription for most Sinhala letters.However some G2P conversion rules are pro-posed in this paper to complement the generationof more accurate phonemic transcription.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 gives an overview of the Sinhala pho-nemic inventory and the Sinhala writing system,Section 3 briefly discusses G2P conversion ap-proaches.
Section 4 describes the schwa epenthe-sis issue peculiar to Sinhala and Section 5 ex-plains the Sinhala G2P conversion architecture.890Section 6 gives experimental results and our dis-cussion on it.
The work is summarized in thefinal section.2 Sinhala Phonemic Inventory andWriting System2.1 The Sinhala Phonemic InventorySinhala is the official language of Sri Lanka andthe mother tongue of the majority - 74% of itspopulation.
Spoken Sinhala contains 40 segmen-tal phonemes; 14 vowels and 26 consonants asclassified below in Table 1 and Table 2 (Ka-runatillake, 2004).There are two nasalized vowels occurring intwo or three words in Sinhala.
They are /a~/, /a~:/,/?~/ and /?~~:/ (Karunatillake, 2004).
Spoken Sin-hala also has following Diphthongs; /iu/, /eu/,/?u/, /ou/, /au/, /ui/, /ei/, /?i/, /oi/ and /ai/(Disanayaka, 1991).Front Central BackShort Long Short Long Short LongHigh i     i:      u    u:Mid e   e:   \ \: o    o:Low ?

Sinhala Character Set.Sinhala characters are written left to right inhorizontal lines.
Words are delimited by a spacein general.
Vowels have corresponding full-character forms when they appear in an absoluteinitial position of a word.
In other positions, theyappear as ?strokes?
and, are used with consonantsto denote vowel modifiers.
All vowels except???
/iru:/, are able to occur in word initial posi-tions (Disanayaka, 1995).
The vowel /?/ and /?
:/occurs only in loan words of English origin.Since there are no special symbols to representthem, frequently the ???
vowel is used to sym-bolize them (Karunatillake, 2004).All consonants occur in word initial positionexcept /?/ and nasals (Disanayaka, 1995).
Thesymbols ??
?, and ???
represent the retroflexnasal /?/ and the retroflex lateral /?/ respectively.But they are pronounced as their respectivealveolar counterparts ??
?-/n/ and ??
?-/l/.Similarly, the symbol ???
representing theretroflex sibilant /?/, is pronounced as the palatalsibilant ???-/?/.
The corresponding aspiratedsymbols of letters ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?namely ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
respectivelyare pronounced like the corresponding un-aspirates (Karunatillake, 2004).
When conso-nants are combined with /r/ or /j/, special con-junct symbols are used.
???
?-/r/ immediately fol-lowing a consonant can be marked by the symbol????
added to the bottom of the consonant preced-ing it.
Similarly, ???
?-/j/, immediately followingconsonant can be marked by the symbol ???
?891added to the right-hand side of the consonantpreceding it (Karunatillake, 2004).
???
/ilu/ and???
/ilu:/ do not occur in contemporary Sinhala(Disanayaka, 1995).
Though there are 60 sym-bols in Sinhala (Disanayaka, 1995), only 42symbols are necessary to represent Spoken Sin-hala (Karunatillake, 2004).3 G2P Conversion ApproachesThe issue of mapping textual content into pho-nemic content is highly language dependent.Three main approaches of G2P conversion are;use of a pronunciation dictionary, use of welldefined language-dependent rules and data-driven methods (El-Imam and Don, 2005).One of the easiest ways of G2P conversion isthe use of a lexicon or pronunciation dictionary.A lexicon consists of a large list of words to-gether with their pronunciation.
There are severallimitations to the use of lexicons.
It is practicallyimpossible to construct such to cover the wholevocabulary of a language owing to Zipfian phe-nomena.
Though a large lexicon is constructed,one would face other limitations such as efficientaccess, memory storage etc.
Most lexicons oftendo not include many proper names, and onlyvery few provide pronunciations for abbrevia-tions and acronyms.
Only a few lexicons providedistinct entries for morphological productions ofwords.
In addition, pronunciations of somewords differ based on the context and their parts-of-speech.
Further, an enormous effort has to bemade to develop a comprehensive lexicon.
Inpractical scenarios, speech synthesizers as wellas speech recognizers need to be able to producethe pronunciation of words that are not in thelexicon.
Names, morphological productivity andnumbers are the three most important cases thatcause the use of lexica to be impractical (Juraf-sky and Martin, 2000).To overcome these difficulties, rules can bespecified on how letters can be mapped to pho-nemes.
In this way, the size of the lexicon can bereduced as only to contain exceptions to therules.
In contrast to the above fact, some systemsrely on using very large lexicons, together with aset of letter-to-sound conversion rules to dealwith words which are not found in the lexicon(Black and Lenzo, 2003).These language and context dependent rulesare formulated using phonetic and linguisticknowledge of a particular language.
The com-plexity of devising a set of rules for a particularlanguage is dependent on the degree of corre-spondence between graphemes and phonemes.For some languages such as English and French,the relationship is complex and require largenumbers of rules (El-Imam and Don, 2005;Damper et al, 1998), while some languages suchas Urdu (Hussain, 2004), and Hindi (Ramakish-nan et al, 2004; Choudhury, 2003) show regularbehavior and thus pronunciation can be modeledby defining fairly regular simple rules.Data-driven methods are widely used to avoidtedious manual work involving the above ap-proaches.
In these methods, G2P rules are cap-tured by means of various machine learningtechniques based on a large amount of trainingdata.
Most previous data-driven approaches havebeen used for English.
Widely used data-drivenapproaches include, Pronunciation by Analogy(PbA), Neural Networks (Damper et al, 1998),and Finite-State-Machines (Jurafsky and Martin,2000).
Black et al (1998) discussed a method forbuilding general letter-to-sound rules suitable forany language, based on training a CART ?
deci-sion tree.4 Schwa Epenthesis in SinhalaG2P conversion problems encountered in Sinhalaare similar to those encountered in the Hindi lan-guage (Ramakishnan et al, 2004).
All consonantgraphemes in Sinhala are associated with an in-herent vowel schwa-/?/ or /a/ which is not repre-sented in orthography.
Vowels other than /?/ and/a/ are represented in orthographic text by plac-ing specific vowel modifier diacritics around theconsonant grapheme.
In the absence of anyvowel modifier for a particular consonant graph-eme, there is an ambiguity of associating /?/ or/a/ as the vowel modifier.
The inherent vowelassociation in Sinhala can be distinguished fromHindi.
In Hindi the only possible association isschwa vowel where as in Sinhala either ofvowel-/a/ or schwa-/?/ can be associated with aconsonant.
Native Sinhala speakers are naturallycapable of choosing the association of the appro-priate vowel (/?/ or /a/) in context.
Moreover,linguistic rules describing the transformation ofG2P, is rarely found in literature, with availableliterature not providing any precise proceduresuitable for G2P conversion of contemporarySinhala.
Automating the G2P conversion processis a difficult task due to the ambiguity of choos-ing between /?/ and /a/.A similar phenomenon is observed in Hindiand Malay as well.
In Hindi, the ?deletion of theschwa vowel (in some cases)?
is successfully892solved by using rule based algorithms (Choud-hury 2003; Ramakishnan et al, 2004).
In Malay,the character ?e?
can be pronounced as eithervowel /e/ or /?/, and rule based algorithms areused to address this ambiguity (El-Imam andDon, 2005).In our research, a set of rules is proposed todisambiguate epenthesis of /a/ and /?/, when as-sociating with consonants.
Unlike in Hindi, inSinhala, the schwa is not deleted, instead alwaysinserted.
Hence, this process is named ?SchwaEpenthesis?
in this paper.5 Sinhala G2P Conversion ArchitectureAn architecture is proposed to convert SinhalaUnicode text into phonemes encompassing a setof rules to handle schwa epenthesis.
The G2Parchitecture developed for Sinhala is identical tothe Hindi G2P architecture (Ramakishnan et al,2004).
The input to the system is normalizedSinhala Unicode text.
The G2P engine first mapsall characters in the input word into correspond-ing phonemes by using the letter-to-phonememapping table below (Table 4).?

G2P Mapping TableThe mapping procedure is given in section 5.1.Then, a set of rules are applied to this phonemicstring in a specific order to obtain a more accu-rate version.
This phonemic string is then com-pared with the entries in the exception lexicon.
Ifa matching entry is found, the correct pronuncia-tion form of the text is obtained from the lexicon,otherwise the resultant phonemic string is re-turned.
Hence, the final output of G2P model isthe phonemic transcription of the input text.5.1 G2P Mapping ProcedureEach tokenized word represented by Unicodenormalization form is analyzed by individualgraphemes from left to right.
By using the G2Pmapping table (Table 4), corresponding pho-nemes are obtained.
As in the given exampleFigure 1, no mappings are required for the Zero-Width-Joiner and diacritic Hal marker ????
(Ha-lant) which is used to remove the inherent vowelin a consonant.Figure 1.
G2P Mapping (Example).The next step is epenthesis of schwa-/?/ forconsonants.
In Sinhala, the tendency of associat-ing a /?/ with consonant is very much higher thanassociating vowel /a/.
Therefore, initially, allplausible consonants are associated with /?/.
Toobtain the accurate pronunciation, the assigned/?/ is altered to /a/ or vice versa by applying theset of rules given in next section.
However, whenassociating /?/ with consonants, /?/ should asso-ciate only with consonant graphemes excludingthe graphemes ???
?, ???
and ???
?, which do notcontain any vowel modifier or diacritic Halmarker.
In the above example, only /n/ and first/j/ are associated with schwa, because other con-sonants violate the above principle.
When schwais associated with appropriate consonants, theresultant phonemic string for the given example(section 5.1) is; /n?mj?ji/.5.2 G2P Conversion RulesIt is observed that resultant phoneme stringsfrom the above procedure should undergo severalmodifications in terms of schwa assignments intovowel /a/ or vice versa, in order to obtain the ac-curate pronunciation of a particular word.Guided by the literature (Karunatillake, 2004), itwas noticed that these modifications can be car-ried out by formulating a set of rules.The G2P rules were formulated with the aid ofphonological rules described in the linguisticliterature (Karunatillake, 2004) and by a com-prehensive word search analysis using the UCSC893Sinhala corpus BETA (2005).
Some of these ex-isting phonological rules were altered in order toreflect the observations made in the corpus wordanalysis and to achieve more accurate results.The proposed new set of rules is empiricallyshown to be effective and can be convenientlyimplemented using regular expressions.Each rule given below is applied from left toright, and the presented order of the rules is to bepreserved.
Except for rule #1, rule #5, rule #6and rule #8, all other rules are applied repeatedlymany times to a single word until the conditionspresented in the rules are satisfied.Rule #1: If the nucleus of the first syllable is aschwa, the schwa should be replaced by vowel/a/ (Karunatillake, 2004), except in the followingsituations;(a) The syllable starts with /s/  followed by /v/.(ie.
/sv/)(b) The first syllable starts with /k/ where as,/k/ is followed by /?/ and subsequently /?/ is pre-ceded by /r/.
(ie.
/k?r/)(c) The word consists of a single syllable havingCV structure (eg.
/d?/ ?
)Rule #2:(a) If /r/ is preceded by any consonant, followedby /?/ and subsequently followed by /h/, then /?/should be replaced by /a/.
(/[consonant]r?h/->/[consonant]rah/ )(b) If /r/ is preceded by any consonant, followedby /?/ and subsequently followed by any conso-nant other than /h/, then /?/ should be replaced by/a/.(/[consonant]r?
[!h]/->/[consonant]ra[!h]/ )(c) If /r/ is preceded by any consonant, followedby /a/ and subsequently followed by any conso-nant other than /h/, then /a/ should be replaced by/?/.(/[consonant]ra[!h]/->/[consonant]r?
!h]/)(d) If /r/ is preceded by any consonant, followedby /a/ and subsequently followed by /h/, then /a/is retained.
(/[consonant]ra[h]/->/[consonant]ra[h]/)Rule #3: If any vowel in the set {/a/, /e/, /?/, /o/,/\/} is followed by /h/ and subsequently /h/ ispreceded by schwa, then schwa should replacedby vowel /a/.Rule #4: If schwa is followed by a consonantcluster, the schwa should be replaced by /a/ (Ka-runatillake, 2004).Rule #5: If /?/ is followed by the word final con-sonant, it should be replaced by /a/, except in thesituations where the word final consonant is /r/,/b/, /?/ or /?/.Rule #6: At the end of a word, if schwa precedesthe phoneme sequence /ji/, the schwa should bereplaced by /a/ (Karunatillake, 2004).Rule #7: If the /k/ is followed by schwa, andsubsequent phonemes are /r/ or /l/ followed by/u/, then schwa should be replaced by phoneme/a/.
(ie.
/k?
(r|l)u/->/ka(r|l)u/)Rule #8: Within the given context of followingwords, /a/ found in phoneme sequence /kal/, (theleft hand side of the arrow) should be changed to/?/ as shown in the right hand side.?
/kal(a:|e:|o:)y/->/k?l(a:|e:|o:)y/?
/kale(m|h)(u|i)/->/k?le(m|h)(u|i)/?
/kal?h(u|i)/->/k?leh(u|i)/?
/kal?/->/k?l?/The above rules handle the schwa epenthesisproblem.
The corresponding diphthongs (refersection 2) are then obtained by processing theresultant phonetized string.
This string is againanalyzed from left to right, and the phoneme se-quences given in the first column of Table 5 arereplaced by the diphthong, represented in thesecond column.Phoneme Sequence Diphthong/i/ /w/ /u/ /iu//e/ /w/ /u/   /eu//?/ /w/ /u/ /?u//o/ /w/ /u/   /ou//a/ /w/ /u/  /au//u/ /j/ /i/   /ui//e/ /j/ /i/   /ei//?/ /j/ /i/   /?i//o/ /j/ /i/   /oi//a/ /j/ /i/   /ai/Table 5.

of the UCSC Sinhalacorpus was chosen for testing due to the hetero-geneous nature of these texts and hence per-ceived better representation of the language inthis part of the corpus*.
A list of distinct wordswas first extracted, and the 30,000 most fre-quently occurring words chosen for testing.The overall accuracy of our G2P module wascalculated at 98%, in comparison with the samewords correctly transcribed by an expert.Since this is the first known documented workon implementing a G2P scheme for Sinhala, itscontribution to the existing body of knowledge isdifficult to evaluate.
However, an experimentwas conducted in order to arrive at an approxi-mation of the scale of this contribution.It was first necessary, to define a baselineagainst which this work could be measured.While this could be done by giving a single de-fault letter-to-sound mapping for any Sinhalaletter, owing to the near universal application ofrule #1 in Sinhala words (22766 of the 30000words used in testing), the baseline was definedby  the application of this rule in addition to the?default mapping?.
This baseline gives us an er-ror of approximately 24%.
Since the proposedsolution reduces this error to 2%, this work canclaim to have improved performance by 22%.An error analysis revealed the following typesof errors (Table 6):Error description # ofwordsCompound words- (ie.
Single wordsformed by combining 2 or more distinctwords; such as in the case of the Englishword ?thereafter?

/a:/ is ????
which is known as ?Aela-pilla?.
eg.
consonant ????
/k/ associateswith ????
/a:/ to produce grapheme ????
ispronounced as /ka:/.
The above exercise* This accounts for almost two-thirds of the size of this ver-sion of the corpus.revealed some 37 words end withoutvowel modifier ???
?, but are usually pro-nounced with the associated long vowel/a:/.
In the following examples, each inputword is listed first, followed by the erro-neous output of G2P conversion, and cor-rect transcription.??????
(mother) -> /amm?/ -> /amma:/??????
(sister) -> /akk?/ -> /akka:/??????
(taken)-> /gatt?/ -> /gatta:/?
There were 27 words associated with er-roneous conversion of words having theletter ??
?, which corresponds to phoneme/h/.
The study revealed this letter shows anunusual behavior in G2P conversion.?
The modifier used to denote vowel ??
?- ????
is known as ?Geta-pilla?.
Whenthis vowel appears as the initial letter of aword, it is pronounced as /ri/ as in ???
?/rin?/ (minus).
When the correspondingvowel modifier appears in a middle of aword most of the time it is pronounced as/ru/ (Disanayaka, 2000).
eg.
???????
(book)is pronounced as /krutij?/, ????????
(surface) - /pru?
?\j\/, ??????????
(excel-lent)-/utkru??\/.
But 13 words were foundas exceptions of this general rule.
In thosewords, the ????
is pronounced as /ur/rather than /ru/.
eg.
?????????
(news)-/pr?wurti/,?????????(prosperity)-/samurdi/,???????
(opened) - /wiwurt?/.?
In general, vowel modifiers ????
(Adha-pilla), ????
(Diga Adha-pilla) symbolizesthe vowel ???
/?/ and ???
/?
:/ respec-tively.
eg.
consonant ????
/k/ combineswith vowel modifier ????
to create ???
?which is pronounced as /k?/.
Few wordswere found where this rule is violated.
Insuch words, the vowel modifiers ????
and????
represent vowels ??
?- /u/, and ??
?-/u:/ respectively.
eg.
????????
(legend) -/?an?
?ruti/, ?????
(cruel) - /kru:r\/.?
The verbal stem ????
(to do) is pro-nounced as /k?r?/.
Though there are manywords starting with the same verbal stem,there are a few other words differentlypronounced as /kar?/ or /kara/.
eg.????????
(cart) /karatt?y?/, ??????
(dried fish)  /kar?v?l?/.895?
A few of the remaining errors are due tohomographs; ????
- /van?/, /v?n?/; ???
?-/kal?/, /k?l?/; ????
- /kar?/, /k?r?/.The above error analysis itself shows that themodel can be extended.
Failures in the currentmodel are mostly due to compound words andforeign words directly encoded in Sinhala(1.66%).
The accuracy of the G2P model can beincreased significantly by incorporating amethod to identify compound words and tran-scribe them accurately.
If the constituent wordsof a compound word can be identified and sepa-rated, the same set of rules can be applied foreach constituent word, and the resultant pho-netized strings combined to obtain the correctpronunciation.
The same problem is observed inthe Hindi language too.
Ramakishnan et al(2004) proposed a procedure for extracting com-pound words from a Hindi corpus.
The utiliza-tion of compound word lexicon in their rule-based G2P conversion module improved the ac-curacy of G2P conversion by 1.6% (Ramakish-nan et al, 2004).
In our architecture, the mostfrequently occurring compound words and for-eign words are dealt with the aid of an excep-tions lexicon.
Homographs are also disambigu-ated using the most frequently occurring wordsin Sinhala.
Future improvements of the architec-ture will include incorporation of a compoundword identification and phonetization module.7 ConclusionIn this paper, the problem of Sinhala grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is addressed with a spe-cial focus on dealing with the schwa epenthesis.The proposed G2P conversion mechanism willbe useful in various applications in the speechdomain.
To the best of our knowledge no otherdocumented evidence has been reported for Sin-hala grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in theliterature.
There are no other approaches avail-able for the transcription of Sinhala text that pro-vides a platform for comparison of the proposedrule-based method.
The empirical evidence froma wide spectrum Sinhala corpus indicates that theproposed model can account for nearly 98% ofcases accurately.The proposed G2P module is fully imple-mented in Sinhala TTS being developed at Lan-guage Technology Research Lab, UCSC.
