Maier, Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST), Trento, Italymaier@irst.itThis paper briefly outlines observa.tions fi'om texts made with respect to rhetorical relationsand communicative goals.
Then it will be shown how these ol)servations have been encoded intoknowledge resources which are part of an integrated architecture for the gelmration of multimediaoutput.Both communicative goals and rhetorical relations are virtual constructs - surface signals hintat their existence.
In the following we briefly discuss the various linguistic means by which bothrhetorical relations and communicative goals are signaled in texts.Identif ication of Rhetorical  Relations in TextFor rhetorical relations urface signals are cue phrases like e.g.
conjunctions.
If no cue phraseexists for a relation lexical cohesion may play that role.Example  1: (Cue Phrase)When a pathway is used several times in succession, the threshohl falls.Example  2: (Lexical Cohesion)Water was all about thenl, was carrying them, was putting t\]|ell!
down, was sinking,was ebbing away.In Example 1 the CONDITIONality ill the link between the two sentences i expressed by meansof the conjunction when.
In example 2, on the contrary, the SEQUENCE in the events reported isimplicit in the verbs which can be inferred as temporally linked.
This example also shows howa rhetorical relation contril)utes to the development of the topic and the progression of theme.\]t can be observed, ior instance, that the SEQUENCE relation preserves the theme over a chainof events (on that point see also \[Matthiessen a d Bateman, '91\]).Ident i f i ca t ion  of  Comnaun icat ive  Goa ls  in TextThe phenomena for which comnmnicative goals are responsible axe quite (liIthrent.
The effectsof a communicative goal on a text unit can best 1)e observed wheu the text unit consists ofvarious sentences.
These sentences usually sha.re a nuutber of features which can be consideredas characteristics of the goal at hand.1.
Sentences "belonging" to the same communicative goal are centered around a global (para-graph) focus, which represents he overall topic of the text unit.2.
Text units corresponding to the same communicative goal ca.u be characterized by the useof a restricted set of rhetorical relations - this is one way how communicative goals andrhetorical relations interact.70
