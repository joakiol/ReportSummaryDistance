However, present systems use markers in fairly simplistic waysandcannot make use of the full potential of markers that language offers for a given relation.?
To improve this situation, we propose a specialized lexicon for discourse markers, which holdsthe relevant constraints and preferences a sociated with the markers, and which can be used bya text generator to make an informed choice among alternative ways of expressing a relationin the given context, we demonstrate how .the lexicon can be employed in the generation?
process and propose to perform discourse marker choice in the sentence planning stage, wherethe interactions with other generation?
decisions can be accounted for.1 IntroductionWhen a coherence relation ties two adjacent portions of text together, it is often lexically signalledon  the linguistic surface with a suitable word--most Often a conjunction, but  also a preposition, aprepositional phrase or an adverb \[Quirk et al 1972\].
The set of words from these grammaticallyheterogeneous classes that can signal coherence relations we call discourse markers.
For example,:the CONCESSION relation in English can be signalled with the subordinator although, the adverbStill, the preposition despite, and a number of other words.For most coherence relations, language offers quite a variety of such markers, as several studiesOf individual relations have demonstrated (see references in Section 2).
Accordingly, from thegeneration perspective, a serious choice task arises if the produced ?
text is not only to simply signal: the coherence relation, but  moreover to reflect pragmatic goals, stylistic considerations, and thedifferent connotations markers have.
The importance of these factors was stressed by Scott and deSouza \[1990\], who gave a number of informal heuristics for when and how to signal the presence ofcoherence relations in text.
Fleshing out the choice task in order to come up with a computationalmodel, though, reveals two sources of difficulty.For one thing, in addition to syntactic variety, the precise semantic and pragmatic differencesbetween similar markers can be quite difficult to determine.
For instance, the CONCESSION markersalthough and even though differ merely in emphasis; the CAUSE markers because and since differin whether they mark the following information as given or not; the German CAUSE markers weiland denn differ in the illocution type of the conjuncts (proposition versus statement).

28/29, 10587 Berlin, Germany; email: stedeecs.tu-ber l in.de128IIIIII.Jl!iiI.II.IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiIIIthe dependencies between marker choice and other generation decisions are rather intricate.
Theidea of avoiding them is, presumably, the reason for the simplistic treatment of marker choice intypical generators to-date: They regard discourse markers as mere consequences of the structuraldecisions, hence do not perform any choice.
We wish to demonstrate, however , that this strategy,which is typical for dealing with closed-class lexical items in general, is too great .a simplificationin these cases.In this paper, we propose to use a discourse marker lexicon as a declarative resource for thesentence planning stage of the text generation process.
The paper is organized as follows.
Section2 examines the role of discourse markers in NLG and reviews the state of the art.
Section 3 brieflysummarizes the ideas on sentence planning that have arisen in the past few years and argues thatfor a sophisticated treatment of discourse marker choice, a dedicated lexicon is to be used as oneinformation resource in sentence planning.
Sect ion 4 ?introduces the discourse marker lexicon weare currently developing, and Section 5 describes how this lexicon can be usefully employed in thesentence planning phase to realize more flexible marker production.. J  _2 Discourse markers  in NLGWe follow Moser and Moore \[1995\] in assuming that three distinct though interrelated ecisionshave to be made when generating discourse markers: Whether to place a marker or not (markeroccurrence), where to place a marker (marker placement), and finally, which marker to use (markerselection).Research on connectives in the context of NLG has focused on the selection of markers toproduce coherent and cohesive multi-sentential text.
Studies fall into two distinct groups: First,studies are concerned with identifying the characteristic ?properties of a small set of similar markers,and determining the reasons behind choosing a particular marker from this set in a given context;examples are the markers ince and because \[Elhadad and McKeown 1990\], or the temporal mark,ers before ?
and while \[Dorr and Gaasterland 1995\].
Second, a number of studies take particular(RST-)relati0ns as a starting-point, and examine how these relations are signalled on the linguisticsurface; examples are the PURPOSE, RESULT and PRECONDITION relations \[Vander Linden 1994\],the CONCESSION relation \[Grote t al.
1997\], and the subject-matter relations occurring in a tech-nical domain \[RSsner and Stede 1992, Delin et al 1996\].
However , these are all isolated studies,geared towards a particular application.
There is at present no overall framework that supportsinformed and motivated marker generation for more than a small set of markers and relations.The broadest overview on discourse markers to our knowledge is the descriptive work of Knottand Mellish \[1996\], but it does not specifically address the NLG perspective.
Moser and Moore\[1995\] and DiEugenio et al \[1997\] also take a broader view on marker production in that they tryto determine general factors that influence the use of markers in text, and in that they considermore than pairs of propositions.?
However, they are largely ?
concerned with marker occurrence andplacement, not with marker selection.3 Sentence planningThe traditional ?plit of NLG systems in a content determination/what-to-say component and arealization/how-to-say component was in recent years ?supplemented by an intermediate stage:sentence planning, sometimes called micro-planning (e.g., Rambow and Korelsky \[1992\]).
Theprimary motivation for this step is to relieve the text planner from language-specific knowledge, ?and to relieve the realization component from any planning or decision-making that potentially?
129 .affects the mean.ing of the utterance.
Hence, better control of the overall generation process isgained.
We do not elaborate the advantages further here; see, for example, \[Panaget 1994\].What are the specific decisions to be made by the sentence planner?
We think it is important oseparate the format{re decisions from the motivations that lead to the particular choices.
FollowingWanner and Hovy \[1996\], a sentence planner has tomake the following decisions: Fine-graineddiscourse structuring, including discourse marker choice; sentence grouping and sentence contentdetermination; clause-internal structuring; Choice of referring expressions; lexical choice} Twogroups of considerations are important for these tasks: First, the motivating factors such as stylisticchoices, semantic relations, intentions, theme development, focusing, discourse history.
Second,the  interactions with other desicions, because different formative decision may realize the samemotivation.
In  contrast o present NLG systems, which realize the production of marker choices asa mere consequence of other sentence level decisions, we think that sentence planning interactionsough t to be respected for discourse markers, too, as the following examples illustrate:?
Ordering of related clauses (cause-effect vs. effect-cause) " .Because he was unhappy, he asked to be transferred, vs.
He asked to be transferred, for hewas unhappy, vs. ?
For he was unhappy, he asked to be transferred.?
AggregationHe has quarrelled with the chairman.
He resigned from his post.
vs.
He has quarrelled withthe chairman and resigned from his post.?
Delimit individual sentencesThey fought a battle.
A f terwards ,  it snowed, vs. Af ter  they fought a battle, it snowed.?
?
Clause-internal structuring (hypotaxis vs. parataxis)A l though he has tried hard, he failed, vs.
He tried hard, but  he failed.?
Lexical choice (to know vs. ignorance)She died, because she didn't know the rules, vs. She died through ignorance of the rules.?
Realizing negationHe will not attend unless he finishes his paper, vs.
He will attend if he finishes his paper.Due to these interdependencies, any fixed order of making decisions in sentence planning wiilimpose limitations on the expressiveness of the system.
Accordingly, we advocate a flexible orderof decisiommaking, as it can be realized in a blackboard-based architecture such as proposedby DIOGENES \[Nirenburg et al 1989\] and HealthDoc \[Wanner and Hovy 1996\].
Moreover, theindividual modules or knowledge sources should rely on declarative representations a much aspossible; otherwise the control process becomes extremely complicated.
And one of the declarativesources of information, we feel, should be a lexicon that assembles ?
pecifically the informationassociated with discourse markers.4 ?
?The Discourse marker lexicon4.1 D iscourse  markers  as lex ica l  ent i t iesThe traditional clistinction between content words and function words (or open-Class and closed-class items) relies on the stipulation that the former have their "own" meaning independent of the1How exactly these tasks axe to be accomplished depends on the nature of the input and output representations,and thus on the architecture of the generator.
In Section 5, we will introduce the framework we axe using andcharacterize the integratio n of marker choice into the sentence planning phase.
?130IIII,I!i{Ii i,|!.icontext in which they are used, whereas the latter assume meaning only in context.
Then, contentwords are assigned to the realm of the lexicon, whereas function words are treated as a part ofgrammar.
For dealing with discourse markers, we do not regard this distinction as particularlyhelpful, though.
These words can carry a wide variety of semantic and pragmatic overtones, whichrender the task of selecting a marker meaning-driven, as opposed to a mere consequence of structuraldecisions.Furthermore, notice that a number of lexical relations customarily used to assign structure tothe universe of "open Class" lexical items can be applied to discourse markers as well.
For instance,the German words obzwar and obschon (both more formal variants of obwohl = although) are atleast very close to being synonyms.
As for p les ionyms (near-synonyms), although and though,according to Martin \[1992\], differ in formality, and although and even though differ in terms ofemphasis.
I f  and unless can be seen as antonyms,  as they both express conditionality, but withopposite polarity.
Some markers are more specific than others, thus display hyponymy.
E.g.,but can signal a general CONTRAST or a more specific CONCESSION.
Finally, other than beingmore or less specific, some markers can signal quite different relations; e.g., while can be used forTEMPORAL CO-OCCURRENCE, and also for CONTRAST.
Hence, the marker is po lysemous .For these reasons, discourse markers hould be described by a dedicated lexicon that provides aclassification of their syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features and characterizes the relationshipsbetween similar markers.
This will be a lexicon whose main grouping criterion is function ratherthan grammatical category; not surprisingly, this is motivated by the production perspective, wherethe parameters governing the generation decisions play the central role.4.2 Methodo logyMethodological considerations pertain to the two tasks of determining the set of words we regardas discourse markers, and determining the lexical entries for these words.Finding the "right" set of discourse markers is not an easy task, since the common lexicographicpractice of having syntactic behaviour as the criterion for inclusion does not apply.
Knott andMellish \[1996\] provide an apt summary of the situation.
Their 'test for relational phrases' is agood start, but geared towards the English language (we are investigating German as well), andfurthermore it catches only items relating clauses; in Despite the heavy rain, we went for a walk itwould not detect a cue phrase.
To identify more markers, we worked with traditional dictionariesand with grammars like Quirk et al \[1972\] and Helbig and Buscha \[1991\].
The resulting set ofmarkers is further validated by investigating coherence relations and their possible realizations;here, we can draw on our earlier work \[RSsner and Stede 1992, Grote et al 1997\].As for the shape of the lexical entries, there are two tasks: First, determining the distinguishingfeatures and classifying markers according to these features, and second, finding appropriate com-putational representations.
At present, we axe mostly concerned with the first step, but in section5, we make an initial proposal for representations.Regarding the set of features, our goal can be characterized as finding a synthesis of two differentperspectives on marker description, between which there has been little overlap in the researchliterature: Text linguistics considers markers as a means to signal coherence, and provides us withinsights on the semantic and pragmatic properties of marker Classes, hence approaches the matter"top-down".
On the other hand, grammars and style guides provide syntactic, semantic and stylisticproperties of individual markers, thus look "bottom-up".Specifying the distinctions within sets of similar markers can be quite subtle.
In addition todrawing on our earlier work cited above, we employ techniques uch as paraphrasing, Knott'ssubstitution test \[Knott and Mellish 1996\], analysis of typical distributions using corpora, and con-trastive studies.
Extracting features in this way seems justified since at this stage we arc unl ike131feature unless for however even though notwithstandingsyntacticpart-of-speechconnection typescope of markerpositionlinear orderingsemanticsemantic relationpolarityfunctional ordernuclearitypragmaticformalityemphasisdiscourse r lationsubordinatorhypotaxisS simplefrontN Sconditionact negatedanyN: actstandardnonePRECONDIT IONsubordinatorhypotaxisanyfrontNScauseanyeffect-causeN: effectstandardnoneVOL.CAUSEadverbintersent.anyfront/mid/endSNconcessionanyconceding-concededN- concededstandardnoneCONCESSIONsubordinatorhypotaxisS simplefrontanyconcessionanyanyN: concededstandardintensifiedCONCESSIONprepositionintraclausalN and S simplefrontanyconcessionanyanyN: concededformalnoneCONCESSIONTable 1: Sample lexicon entries for some English markersDiEugenio et al \[1997J--not concerned with the predictive power of individual features but ratherwith decomposing markers into features that are relevant for integrating marker choice into sentenceplanning.4.3 The  shape o f  the  lex iconThe initial set of features we have thus obtained can be grouped in the traditional categories:Syntact ic  features  are the part-of:speech ofa marker and the type of connection it establishes(prepositions link constituents within a clause; conjunctions build a paratactic or hypotactic struc-ture, but some can also function as intersentential linkers).
The scope of a marker is the complexityof the segments it can combine (complex subtree or simple propositions).
The linear ordering ofthe conjuncts can differ from marker to marker (e.g., with the connective for, the subordinateclause is always postponed ) as well as the marker's position within the segment (e.g., prepositionsalways occur at the beginning of a segment; adverbs like however can occur in front-, mid- andend-position).Semant ic  features  are foremost he semantic relation established (e.g.
causal or temporallink).
Some markers how a particular behaviour towards negation, which is related to polarity(e.g., ffversus unless).
Further, we observe that Certain markers impose what we term a functionalordering, for instance, for requires the order effect-cause.Pragmat ic  features  include the discourse relation expressed by the marker and the type ofillocutionary acts it conjoins (e:g., German well links propositions, denn links judgements).
Somemarkers differ in terms of presuppositions and the assignment of given/new (e.g., because versussince).
Stylistic features represent dimensions like formality and emphasis.To illustrate how these features discriminate between markers, table 1 gives five preliminarysample entries.
N is a shorthand for nucleus in the RST sense, S for satellite.
Notice that table1 is merely an illustration, and not all the features introduced above are actually required forclassification.
Issues of lexical representation, i cluding dealing with polysemy and homonymy insome inheritance-based formalism, will be addressed in a later stage of the project.132~N'D.I ~ ~  II01 II11.
i141 1151131 141 171 St CE181 191Figure 1: Input structure to sentence planner5 The discourse marker lexicon in sentence planningHaving outlined the discourse marker lexicon as a general resource, we now turn to the question ofusing it in sentence planning.
Even though the lexicon is still under development, we will illustratewith several prototypical representations how a sentence planner can exploit the various realizationoptions offered by the lexicon.We assume the following framework: a discourse structure tree loosely based on RST \[Mannand Thompson 1988\] serves as input to the sentence planner.
RS-trees comprise a set of proposi-tions as leaf nodes; the internal nodes represent coherence relations holding between the daughternodes.
The tree is encoded in the description logic LOOM \[MacGregor and Bates 1987\], and thepropositions are represented following the ontology used in the MOOSE system \[Stede 1996\].
Thenature Of these representations eed not concern us here, but it is important hat they  are all"grounded" in a knowledge base so that type checking via subsumption can take place.The output of the sentence planning module is a sequence of lexicalised sentence-semanticspecifications (SemSpecs), based on SPL \[Kasper 1989\].
Accordingly, sentence planning in thisframework amounts to linearizing a discourse representation tree.
As front-end sentence generator,we use KPML \[Bateman 1997\].
A sample input structure from the domain of maintenance manualsis given in figure I; figure 2 shows one possible realization.
Numbers in the tree correspond to textsegments, and each segment corresponds to one underlying proposition.\[Wait\]l until \[the ngine is cool\]2, then \[turn the radiator cap clockwise\]3 until \[it stops\]4.

F igure 2: One linguistic realization of the RST-tree.5.1 The  "generat ion  v iew"  of  the  d i scourse  marker  lex iconFrom the production perspective, the lexical features are to be classified with respect o when andwhere they come into play in the generation process; this amounts to one particular "view" on theinformation coded in the lexicon.
We propose these categories:?
Appl icabi l i ty  condit ions:  The necessary conditions that need to be present in the inputrepresentation for the marker to be a candidate.
Chiefly, this is the semantic/discourserelation to be expressed, and also (if applicable) features pertaining to presuppositions andintentions.133?
Combinab i l i ty  condi t ions :  The constraints that the marker imposes on its neighbouringlinguistic onstituents (the 'syntagmatic' dimension).
These are syntactic onstraints on sub-categorization and semantic type constraints, which interact with other realization decisionsin sentence planning.?
D i s t ingu ish ing  features:  If preferential choice dimensions, uch as style, brevity, etc., areattended to in the ?system, then these features erve to distinguish markers that are otherwise(nearly) synonymous (the 'paradigmatic' dimension).For encoding this information, we adopt the framework used in the lexicalization approach ofthe MOOSE sentence generator \[Stede 1996\].
Here, lexicon entries consist of (inter alia) the threezones denotation, partial SemSpec (PSemSpec), and stylistic features.
The ?denotation is the part tobe matched (qua subsumption) against he input rePresentation; it may contain type restrictions.The PSemSpec is an SPL-like template that includes a : lex  annotation with the actual exeme andpossibly variables that are replaced by other PSemSpecs in the course of the lexicalization process.Also, any realization directives needed by the front-end generator are stated here.
Stylistic featuresare used for preferential choice between words that would all be applicable in a particular context.When generalizing this framework to include discourse markers (and hence allowing for produc-ing complex sentences), the denotation of a marker would be an RST relati0n 2 with variables forthe relata, possibly enriched with type constraints.
For relations with a nuCleus and a satellite, wealways write them in this order, hence (RELATION NUCLEUS SATELLITE).
As a simple case, con-sider the subordinating conjunction until, which we take to be a marker of the relation UNTIL 3, astraightforward case indeed.
Its denotation is (UNTIL X (STATE Y)), meaning that it can be usedto verbalize any UNTIL node whose satellite is of type STATE, according to the ontology or domainmodel in the knowledge base.The variables used in the denotation also :appear in the PSemSpec of  until, so that partialSemSpecs canbe  combined together correctly.
Here, the  nucleus of the UNTIL relation becomesthe domain of the rs t -unt i l  relation as defined in the KPML Upper Model, 4 and the satelliteis mapped to range, which we further constrain to be a re la t iona l -p rocess  (in Upper Modelterms).
Furthermore, we add :theme X to ensure that the nucleus is ordered before the satellite(to avoid until Y, X).
The complete lexicon entry together with a few more exa=mples i  given infigure 3: The denotations and PSemSpecs for the subordinating conjunctions until marking UNTILand after, if, then, unless marking PRECONDITION, and for the preposition with in its function asmarker for the relation PRECONDITION.5.2 Marker  cho iceIn MOOSE, lexical options constitute the search space for building a lexicalized semantic sentencespecification.
Now, we generalize this idea to discourse trees: For propositional nodes MOOSEcalculates all possible lexical options; for coherence relation nodes, the list of options realizing thenode is taken from the discourse marker lexicon by matching the node against the applicabilityconditions of the lexicon entries.
Thus, the entire discourse tree is annotated with verbalizationoptions, which together constitute the search space for sentence planning.~The relations used in denotations effectively constitute the interface between the lexicon and the text plannerproducing the discofirse tree.
At present we use RST, but we regard this only as an interim solution.
For the purposesof this paper, the precise inventory of relations used is not critical.3The discourse relation UNTIL was introduced by RSsner and Stede \[1992\]; itsstatus is somewhat questionable,but since we do not address the general issue of discourse relations here, we simply assume its existence.4All Upper Model discourse relations bear the prefix 'RST', which at this point unfortunately might produceconfusion about he variety of relations under discussion.134III/IIUNLESS:DEN (PRECONDITION X Y):PSEM (r / rst-precondition:domain (p / (process X):polarity negative):range Y:theme X)UNTIL:DEN (UNTIL X (state Y)):PSEM (r / rst-until:domain X:range (Y / relational-process):theme X:lex until)THEN:DEN (PRECONDITION X ?

Here, the PRECONDITION relation is Signalled by the in-traclausal linker with (see the lexicon entry above).
Other realizations of this RS subtree are(\[Vander Linden 1994\] offers a similar range):1.
I f  the engine is cold, fill the reserve tank up to the max mark.2.
When the engine is co/d, fill the reserve tank up to the max mark.3.
Fill the reserve tank up to the max mark, only if the engine is cold.4.
A f te r  the engine has cooled down, fill the reserve tank to the upper mark.5.
Do not fill the reserve tank (up to the max mark) unless the engine is cold.6.
Make sure that the engine is cold.
Then ,  fili the reserve tank up to the max mark.To arrive at variant formulations of this kind, depending on different parameters and/or context,our first step is to set up the search space of verbalization options.
While MOOSE performs thisstep for propositions, we will here focus on the coherence relation nodes.
In our example, themarker lexicon yields a set of markers that match the applicability condition (PRECONDITION XY): after, if, only if, then, unless, when and with.
These are annotated at the node, as shown infigure 4, where the leaf nodes are annotated with (shorthands for) some of the lexical options foundby MOOSE..~, RST-PRECONDITION/ ~ f'Only if'then'unless'when'with\]1141 |lS\]nucleus satellite\[activity:fill\]\] \[activity: cool down\]\[state: cold\]Figure 4: Annotated subtree for \[14\] [15\]135From this search space, different decisions made by sentence planning "expert" modules leadto different verbalizations.
For instance, assume that the sentence-structuring expert calls for ahypotactic structure; this is satisfied by PSemSpecs of the form: (r  / r s t -p recond i t ion  :domainX : range Y), hence by the markers if, only if, unless and when.
If the clause-ordering expert callsfor the order satellite-nucleus, unless is ruled out as it requires the nucleus to be stated first (seethe lexicon entry below).
The remaining choice between only if, ffand when is left to fine-graineddiscrimination (e.g., only if is more emphatic), which we do not elaborate here.Alternatively, assume that the sentence-delimitation expert posits that the relation be expressed?
in two separate sentences.
As a consequence, the ordering is satellite-nucleus.
These constraints- are satisfied only by the marker then (example 6).
The sequence of PSemspecs associated withthemarker then further constrains the other sentence planning decisions (see figure 3).Now, it might also be the case that the lexicalization expert (e.g., MOOSE) calls for verbalizingthe result of the cooling process (proposition \[15\]) only and proposes the lexeme be cool Now, themarker after is out, as it requires the satellite to be realized as a subordinate clause with a processof type act iv i ty  (see lexicon entry of AFTER in figure 3).
Alternatively, if the lexeme chosen iscool down, markers such as with are not available, as its PSemSpec allows for combining with aproper ty -ascr ip t ion  only.
Now, if some other expert decides to use a negation with the nucleus,unless is selected as marker since it expects a negativ e polarity in the nucleus; its (partial) lexiconentry is shown figure 3.Selecting unless in turn restricts the options for other sentence planning tasks, since its PSem-Spec states that a hypotactic structure with the subordinate clause in sentence-final position isneeded (due to the :theme X line).
In short, decisions can be propagated in both directions: fromother formative decisions to marker choice, and from marker choice to other decisions.
Imaginethat the process of tree linearization be driven?
by the overall goal of producing concise text; inthis case, the flexibility in ordering decisions allows for producing short text by choosing with andletting the other decisions follow.We have characterized a constraint-based mechanism that does not impose a strict order onmaking decisions in linearizing the discourse tree.
Various ways of implementing such a scheme canbe imagined; one is the blackboard-based approach suggested by Wanner and Hovy \[1996\], anotheris the "Hunter-Gatherer" search paradigm introduced by Beale \[1996\].6 SummaryPresent-day text generation systems typically employ quite simplified approaches for signall ingdiscourse relations in text.
Our work aims at enabling enerators to truly choose discourse markerson the basis of generation parameters and context.
This way, we gain variety in marker usagethat is not just random but controlled.
Furthermore, we are interested in a uniform, declarativerepresentation f the information ecessary.
Approaches that encode marker choice in the grammar(such as Vander Linden \[1994\]), while certainly an improvement over previous h l mappings betweenrelations and markers, loose flexibility when it comes to account for the interactions between markerchoice and other sentence planning decisions.These considerations led us to develop a lexicon of discourse markers.
While its constructionis still in progress, we have shown samples of the kind of representations weare aiming at, and wehave demonstrated how such lexicon entries can be employed as a resource in the sentence planningphase of the generation process.
In our framework, lexicon entries consist of applicability conditions( for  deciding whether the marker is a candidate at all), partial sentence semantic specifications (forcombining the marker with neighbouring constituents), and distinguishing features for paradigmaticchoice.
We have described how an input discourse structure tree can be linearized into a sequence136II|IIIiiIIIil:liIi Iof sentence plans, given a sentence planner that  exploits the information supplied by a discoursemarker lexicon.References\[Bateman 1997\] Bateman, J.
