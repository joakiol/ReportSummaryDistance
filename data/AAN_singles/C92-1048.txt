upenn, edu)Apr i l  23, 1992Abst  rac t  possibility of deictic VP ellipsis, inferrable antecedents,non-syntactically parallel antecedents, eases where theA computational ccount of VP ellipsis is described, in antecedent is formed by combining two or more salientwhich VP's are represented in the discourse model as predicates, and cases where the antecedent is sepa-contextually dependent semantic objects.
It is argued rated from the target by one or more intervening sen-that this approach can handle examples that are not tences(\[27\],\[ll\]).
However, existing semantic accountsallowed by alternative accounts.
An implementation is have important empirical problenm.
For example, I ar-defined in terms of extensions to the Incremental In- gue in \[11\] that they do not permit pronouns to "switchterpretation System.
The treatment of VP ellipsis is reference" from antecedent to target in examples uchanalogous to that of pronominal anaphora.
It is sug- as1:gested that the recency and salience constraints com-monly thought o apply to pronominal anaphora mightapply in a similar way to VP ellipsis.1 I n t roduct ionTim problem of verb phrase llipsis can be divided intotwo sub-problems:Problem (1): how is an antecedent selected?Problem (2): given a particular antecedent, how is itto be reconstructed at the ellipsis site?Most work on VP ellipsis has dealt with Problem (2),concerning the copying or reconstruction of a partic-ular antecedent.
A wide variety of approaches to thisproblem have been proposed, including snrface struc-ture accounts (\[141, \[18\]), "syntactic" LF (\[5\]), and se-mantic (\[251, \[28\], \[15\], \[21\], \[4\], \[23\], \[24\]).
However,I will argue that there is a natural evel of representa-tion that has not been pursued, which I will call the"properly semantic" level.
I will show that this alter-native has significant empirical advantages over otherapproaches to Problem (2).
In addition, the approachsuggests some possible ways of addressing Problem (1),which concerns electing among alternative potentialantecedents.
This problem has been largely ignored.There Is a variety of evidence that indicates that VPellipsis is resolved at a semantic rather than syntac-tic level of representation.
This evidence includes the(1) a. I told John/ that I didn't expect  h im i tofail hisl exam.b.
I told Bill/ that I did.
\[expect him/ to failhisj exam\]Similarly, most existing accounts 2 do not permit apronoun to be bound by different binders in antecedentand target, as in:(2) Every boyi in Bill's class hoped Mary wouldask h iml  out ,  but a boyj in John's classactually knew that she would.
\[ask himj out\]It is interesting to note that none of the existing se-mantic accounts qualify as "properly semantic" accord-lug to some fairly standard criteria.
The modificationsrequired to comply with these criteria, I will argue, areexactly the ones needed to solve these empirical prob-lems.
The criteria I have in mind are tile followingtwo general requirements for semantic representation,imposed in Montague's\[20\] "Universal Grammar":Condition (1): Tile logical form language must be"dispensable".I ha exeanplea of VP ellipaln, the a.ntecedent i  in bold, andthe target, or reconstructed material, is bracketed.2A po~ible exception is the account of Prfist et a1(\[23\], \[24\]).I di$ctms problenm with this account in section 4.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao~'r 1992 3 0 3 PROC.
OV COLING-92, NANTES, AUO.
23-28, 1992Condition (2): Semantic representations must havecontextual parameters.None of the existing semantic accounts satisfies bothof these requirements.
As Partee and Bach\[21\] argue,the Sag/Wil l iams account does not satisfy Condition(1), because it imposes an "alphabetic variance" con-dition, making essential reference to the syntax of log-ical form expressions.
This condition is also imposedin Partee and Bach's account, and a similar conditionarises in a very different setting in the account of Dal-rymple, Shieber and Pereira\[4\].
s Only Lappin's ac-count \[17\] explicitly removes the alphabetic variancecondition, bringing this account in accord with Con-dition (1).
However, semantic representations do nothave contextual parameters in Lappin's account, or inany of the other accounts.Thus, although there is a persistent intuition thatVP ellipsis requires a semantic treatment, no existingaccount is "properly semantic" in the sense requiredby conditions (1) and (2).
In this paper I will describesuch an account, in which the semantic representationo fa  VP is a three-tuple < DM~,P,DMo,t :>, consistingof a property P and input and output discourse models.A key feature of this approach is that the antecedent isreconstructed at the ellipsis site as a semantic objectwhich includes contextual dependencies.
These con-textual dependencies can be resolved independently inthe antecedent and the target.
This is required forexamples uch as (1) and (2).No reference to the syntax of logical form expres-sions is made in this approach, satisfying Condition(1).
The representation f VP's as relations involvinginput and output discourse contexts satisfies Condi-tion (2).
So this account is more "properly semantic"than alternative semantic accounts, whose theoreticalstatus is somewhat less clear.
One consequence of thistheoretical clarity is the ease with which the approachcan be computationally implemented.I will describe an implementation of this approachin terms of some simple extensions to the IncrementalInterpretation System\[22\].
The fact that this systemincorporates contextual dependencies, as required byCondition (2), makes it very simple to implement heapproach.
Indeed in an important sense there are noadditional mechanisms required for VP ellipsis, overand above those independently required for pronominaland other forms of anaphora.I begin with a brief overview of the Incremental In-terpretation System.
I then describe my extensions toaThe account of Klein \[15\], while couched in the DI~F formal-hum, ?uentlally duplicates the Sag/Willian~ approach, definingverlinn~ of the Derived VP rule and the Pronoun Rule in DITrterms.

Finally, 1 point out that thecurrent approach suggests ome promising avenues forprogress on the neglected question concerning the se-lection of an antecedent VP.2 Background: The Incremen-tal Interpretation SystemA semantic representatiou in the Incremental Interpre-tation (henceforth II) System is called a "ConditionalInterpretation", which is defined as an assumption-sense pair, A:s, where A is a set of assumptions, ands is the sense.
The sense can be thought of as the or-dinary truth-conditional semantic representation.
Theassumption set consists of assumptions that have beenintroduced during the derivation, and must be dis-charged before the derivation is complete.
The as-sumption set "represents constraints ou how the sensemay be further connected to its context."
\[22\]The process of interpretation is defined by a set ofstructural rules and a set of discharge rules.
Structuralrules build the conditional interpretation of a phrasecompositionally, from the conditional interpretation ofits parts.
Discharge rules remove assumptions.
Inprinciple all rules have an input and output discoursemodel, but only the discharge rules actually interactwith the discourse model.The form of a structural rule isP ~ A:s ff  P1 ~ Al:sl and  .
.
.and Pk ~ Ak:s:?The ~ denotes the interpretation relation betweena node of a syntactic analysis tree (produced by theparser) and a node of a semantic derivation tree.
Pdenotes a syntactic node, where its immediate con-stituents are denoted by variables P1 through Pk.
Therule schema is to be understood as stating a constraintthat P receives the interpretation A:s if it has con-stituents PI through Pk, and these constituents havethe interpretations indicated.The form of a discharge rule isP ~ A':s' i f  P ~ A:sHere, A I ~- A - {P~}, where R is the dischargedassumption.
The discharge of R, together with thecurrent state of the discourse model, determines somemodifications to s, resulting in s ~.The assumption storage mechanism is based onCooper storage \[3\], which was applied to quantifierphenomena.
In the II system, this mechanism is ap-plied to several additional phenomena.
Below, I willACT~ DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AoLrr 1992 3 0 4 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992describe the rules for pronominal anaphora nd forquantifiers.2.1 Ru les  fo r  P ronomina l  AnaphoraThe treatment of pronominal anaphora in the I tsystemis similar to the approach in Discourse RepresentationTheory(\[13\], [12\]): indefinite NP's introduce new ele-ments in the discourse model.
Pronouns and definitedescriptions find their referent among elements in thediscourse model.Four types of referential NP's are defined: pronouns,definite descriptions, indefinites, and names.
They arerepresented as follows:bind(x,pronoun,number/gender): xbind(x,def,sor t): xbind(x,indef,sort): xbind(x,name,N): xIn each case, the sense is represented by a parame-ter z, and a binding assumption expresses constraintson the way x will be replaced by an entity in the dis-course model.
This is achieved by discharging the bindassumption.
The discharge rules are:A, bind(x,pronoun,number/gender): S =:, A: Six/elA, bind(x,def, sort):S =~ A: Six/elA, bind(x,indef,sort):S =*- A: Six/elA, bind(x,name,N): S :=~ A: Six/elIn the ease of pronouns and definite descriptions,the element e must be a salient element in the inputdiscourse model, satisfying the constraints expressedin the binding assumption.
An indefinite assumptioncauses a new element e to be added to the output dis.course model.
In each case, e is substituted for eachoccurrence of x in the sense S. At least for pronouns,there is a second possibility: instead of selecting efrom the discourse model, some other, undischargedparameter can be selected.
This allows a pronoun tobe bound by a quantifier, as described below.2.2 Rules for QuantifiersThe treatment of qunntifiers in the II system essen-tially duplicates that of Cooper\[3\].
A quantified NPis represented by storing a quantifier assumption, to-gether with a parameter representing the sense.
Atsome later stage in the derivation, the quantifier as-sumption is discharged, determining the scope of thequantifier.
There are two general rules for quantifiers,governing the introduction and discharge of quantifierassumptions.
A quantified NP is represented as:bind(x,q,n): xwhere x is a parameter, q is the quantifier, and n isthe common noun.
For example, "every jet" is repre-sentedbind(x,every,jet): xSimplifying slightly, the discharge of quantifier as-sumptions cml be represented as follows:bind(x,q,s): Pt =*" (q s x) pAs an example,bind(x,everyjet): fly(x) =~ (every jet x) fly(x)As mentioned above, when a pronoun assumption isdischarged, its parameter is replaced either by an entityin the discourse model, or by some, yet undischargedparameter.
A pronoun becomes "bound" by a quan-tifier if the quantifier parameter replaces the pronounparameter in this way.3 The  Account  o f  VP  E l l ips is1 now describe a semantic account of VP ellipsis interms of some simple extensions to the II system.
Theapproach parallels the above approach to pronominalanaphora.
I will define a rule to add VP-meaningsin the discourse model, and a rule for recovering thoseVP-meanings to resolve an elliptical VP.
Thus full VP'sare analogous to indefinite NP's, in that they bothtypically introduce semantic objects into the discoursemodel, and elliptical VP's are analogous to pronouns,in that their interpretation requires the selection of anappropriate object from the discourse model.
The dis-course model will have two sets: SE, the set of saliententities, and SP, tile set of salient predicates.To add VP-meoafings to the discourse model, I allowall lexical verbs to introduce all assumption which addsthe VP-meaning to the discourse model.
I call thisbinding assumption type "pred".
It is discharged asfollows:A, bind(pred):S :=~ A: SwhereDMou, (SP) = DMi.
(SP) U {A:S)That is, tile discharge results in the semantic rep-resentation of the VP (i.e.,the ~.ssumption-sense pairA:S) being added to the SP set of the output discoursemodel.l add the requirement that all arguments except hesubject must be filled hefore the assumption is dis-charged.
That is, the discharge of this a~sumption ispermitted only if tile sense is of the formACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOI~T 1992 3 0 5 PROC.

For example, the representation f the VP"help him" might bebind(x,pronoun,male): help(SUBJ,x).This expresses the constraint hat the object po-sition must be filled by some entity in the discoursemodel according to constraints of pronominal refer-ence.
Two copies of this VP, as antecedent and targetin VP ellipsis, could allow the pronoun to refer to dif-ferent entities, depending on the state of the currentdiscourse model.

Later, the binding assumption for the pro-noun is discharged, allowing the pronoun to be boundto '% boy".This example receives a straightforward derivationin the system I am proposing.
In other accounts, itappears that examples of this sort cannot be acconl-modated.
It is clear, for example, that the exampleviolates the alphabetic variance condition imposed inthe Sag/Will iams approach.
This condition requiresthat the antecedent mid target VP's be identical upto renaming of bound variables.
In the example, theantecedent VP contains a free variable (him/) whichbecomes him./ in the target, violating the alphabeticvariance condition.
Partee and Bach\[21\] adopt essen-tially the same alphabetic variance condition, as doesKlein\[15\], sothat their accounts also rule out the exam-ple.
Lappin's\[17\] acemmt explicitly rejects the alpha-betic variance condition, replacing it with the followingcondition:For any two occurrences c~ and fl of anopen VP intension ?xl, tr can serve as theantecedent of/~ iff both occurrences of xl canbe naturally interpreted as having the sameintended range of possible values.The example clearly violates this condition: sincehim/ ranges over members of Bill's class, and him`/picks out a member of John's class, they do not have"the same intended range of possible values".Next, I consider the higher order matching approachof Dalrymple, Shieber and Pereira\[4\] (DSP).
In thisapproach, a matching operation is performed to solvean equation, in which a second order variable repre-sents the elliptical VP.
To set up the equation, it isSThe quantifier "every boy in Bill's class" is represented inthe derivation as "every boy", for the sake of brevity.
Similarlyfor "a boy in John's class".necessary to determine the antecedent clanse and the"parallel elements", and DSP provide no method Ibrmaking this determination.
"l~\]pieally, with VP ellip-sis, there are two adjacent clauses, in which tile sec-ond clause contains an elliptical VP.
Then the firstclause is the antecedent clause and the two subjectsare the parallel elements.
Applying this to the currentexample, we have "Mary would ask hiual out" as theantecedent clause, and "Mary" mad "she" as parallelelements.
The equation to solve isP(Mary) = ask-out(Mary,him/)In this case, the desired solution,Az.ask-out(x,himj)is not a possible solution to this equation, according totile matching operation used by DSP.
This is the moststraightforward method of determining parallelism toset up the equation, and it does not permit the deriva-tion of the desired reading, tlowever, it may be thatall extended notion of parallelism ight solve the prob-lem.
While this has not been investigated by DSP, suchan approach as been advocated in another ecent ac-count, that proposed by Priist et a1(\[23\],\[24\]).
It ap-pears that this account can accommodate he example,based on Priist et als requirement that if a pronoun pis bound to Q in the antecedent, the corresponding pro-noun p' must be bound to a "structurally parallel" Q~in the target, where this is intended as matching syn-tactic and semantic structure.
However, example (3)indicates that the two quantifiers need not be in struc-turally parallel positions.
Indeed, example (5) showsthat there is no requirement for a corresponding quan-tifier at all.
(3) Almost every boyl in the class hope Marywill ask hlmi out, but I know there are afew boys i who hope that she won't.
\[askhim`/ out\](4) Every boyi in Mrs. Smith's class hoped shewould pass himl.
In John's`/ case, 1 thinkshe will.
\[pass him`/\]Examples (1) - (4) illustrate the flexibility requiredin interpreting pronouns within the antecedent and tar-get VP's.
I have shown how the proposed approachpermits this flexibility.
None of the alternative ac-counts discussed can accommodate hese examples.5 Const ra in ts  on  Se lec t ing  anAntecedentI have argued that tile current approach as significantadvantages over other approaches to problem (2), con-cerning tile level of representation at which VP ellipsisACRES DE COL\]NG-92, NANTf.S, 23-28 AOl~r 1992 3 0 7 PROC.

23-28, 1992is resolved.
In addition, this approach suggests omepoesible ways of v~ldreasing problem (1), concerningthe selection among alternative potential antecedents.Since the approach parallels the treatment of pronomi-nal anaphora, storing semantic representations of bothVP's and NP's in the discourse model, a natural hy-pothesis is that similar constraints govern the selectionof an antecedent in both the pronominal and the VPellipsis cases.The problem of selecting among alternative VP an-tecedents has been virtually ignored in the literature.
6The corresponding problem in pronominal anaphorahas received a significant amount of attention.
TheCentering model (\[6\],\[7\],\[1\]) of pronominal anaphora isa leading example, applying a variety of constraintsdealing with such factors as recency, salience, andattention.
In addition, it is generally agreed thatthere are syntactic onfigurational constraints govern-ing pronominal anaphora of the sort described in the"Binding Theory" of GB\[2\].For each of these types of constraints, there are in-teresting parallels with the case of VP ellipsis.Syntact l c /conf igurat lonah  It appears that VPellipsis obeys the "precede and command" constraint,as pointed out by Jackendo~8\], ruling out examplessuch 8.8(5) * Charlie will, if his mother-in-law doesn'tleave town.Recency:  Just as in the pronominal case, the vastmajority of cases involves an antecedent in the currentor immediately preceding utterance.
In a survey of VPellipsis in the Brown Corpus\[10\], I found this to be trueabout 95% of the time.Sal ience: VP's in less salient positions eem to beless available as antecedents for VP ellipsis.
For exam-pie, Halliday and Hasan\[9\] give the following example:(6) A: The policeman paid no attention to thegirl who was driving the car.
(7) *B: Was she really?Presumably the unavailability ofthe VP "driving thecar" is related to the fact that it appears in a restrictiverelative clause and is thus not particularly salient.A t tent ionah  There is evidence that a "centershift", i.e., shifting attention from one entity to an-other, might be correlated with the availability of VPantecedents.
This is suggested by experimental workof Malt\[19\], who describes experiments hat show, inher terms, that "changing the focus" in an interveningeA note by Klein ~d Stmlnton-EUiJ \[16l, points out the im-portance of problem (l),sentence tends to make a previous VP antecedent in-accessible.
Thus the first example (taken from Malt'sexperiment) was understood more readily than the sec-ond:(8) a.
"I liked the Monet exhibit," Heather re-marked.b.
"It was really very nice".c.
"I did too," Richard replied.
(9) a.
"I liked the Monet exhibit," Heather re-marked.b.
"Renoir is my favorite, though."c.
* "I did too," Richard replied.There is reason to believe, then, that constraints re-lating to factors such as recency, syntactic onfigura-tion, salience, and attention, might apply to VP ellipsisand pronominal nnaphora in a similar way.
A simpli-fied version of these constraints i implemented in thepronoun case of the Incremental Interpretation Sys-tem, and it would a simple matter to allow the sameconstraints to apply to VP antecedents.6 Conc lus ionsWhile it has been argued by many that VP ellipsis isa semantic phenomenon, there is no existing accountthat satisfies ome standard requirements on seman-tic representation, relating to the "dispensability" ofthe meaning-representation language, and the incor-poration of contextual dependencies in semantic rep-resentations.
In addition, existing semantic accountshave important empirical problems, not allowing pro-nouns to switch reference from antecedent to targetwith sufficient flexibility.
The modifications necessaryto comply with the standard requirements on seman-tic representation are exactly the ones needed to solvethese empirical problems.
I have described such a se-mantic account, showing that it handles the examplesthat are ruled out by alternative semantic accounts.The approach is easily implemented eomputationally,by some simple extensions to the Incremental Interpre-tation System.
In addition, there is evidence indicatingthat the selection of a VP antecedent might be subjectto the same sort of constraints that govern pronominalanaphora.7 AcknowledgementsThanks to Mary Dalrymple, Shalom Lappin, AravindJoshi, Christine Nakatani, Dick Oehrle, Mats Rooth,Stuart Shieber, Mark Steedman, and Bonnie WebberAcrEs DE COLING-92, NAgrl~, 23-28 Ao~'r 1992 3 0 8 PROC.
