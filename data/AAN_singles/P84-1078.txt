IntroductionThis report descrnbes Paul.
a computer text generation systemdesigned to cre~:te collesive text through tile use of lexical substitutuons.Spec;hcalty.
thts system ~s designed tn deterministically choose betweenpronominal:zabon sup(:rordinate substitution, and delinite noun phrasereitcrat}on.
Fl~e system identifies a strength at antecedence recovery foreach of the lexical substitutions, anti matches them against the strengthof potenU,# entececJence of each element =n the text to select the propersub3litubons for these elements.P~ul is a natural language generation program initially developed atIBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center as part of the ongoing Epistleproject I5.6}, "\[he emphasis of the the work reported here is in theresearch oJ discourse phenomena, the study of cohesion and its effectson mLJlhsententiat exts \[3, 9\].
Paul accepts as input LISP knowledgestructures consisbng of case frame l1\] formalisms representing eachsentence to be gernerated.
These knowledge structures are translated intoEnghsh, with the appropriate lexical substitutions being made at this time.No attempt vs made by the system to create these knowledge structures.2.
CohesionThe purpose of communication is for one person (the speaker orwriter) to express her thoughts and ideas so that another (the listener orreader) can understand them.
\]here aJe many restrictions placed on therealization of these thoughts inio language so that the listener mayunderstand.
One ot the most important requiroments fo~ an utterance isthat it seem to be unified, that it form a text.
The theory of text and whatdistinguishes it from isolated sentences that is used in Paul is that ofHalliday and Hasan \[3\].One of the items that enhances the unity of text is cohesion.Cohesion refers to the linguistic phenomena that establish relationshipsbetween sentences, thc~reby tying them together.
There are two majorgoals that are accomplished tl~rougi~ cohesiu, that enhance a passage'squalily of text.
The fiust is the obwous oesure to avoid unnecessaryrepetibon.
The other goal is to dislinguL",h new information from old.
,sothat the listener can tully undemtand what fs being said.\[1} The room has a large window, The room has a windowfacing east.
{1} appears to he describing two windows, because there is nodevice indicating that the window of the second sentence is the same asthe window of tile first sentence.
If in tact the speaker me:mr to describethe stone w;ndow, silo must somehow inform the listener that this is1This research was s.pported (in part) by Office of Naval Research contractNO0 14-80-C.0505, anJ (in pint) by Nation31 Institutes of I-le31lh Grant No.

Cohesion us a device that will accomplish thas goal,Cohesion is created when the interpretation of an element isdependent on the me.aning of another.
\ ]he element in guestion can.at behJIly understood until 1he element d is dependenl on zs ~dcntdned.
rhe firstpresupposes \[3\] the second in that it requ,es for its understanding theexnstence of the second.
An element at a sentence presupposes theexistence of another when its interpretation requires relerence tOanother.
Once we can trace these lelerences to their sources, we cancorrectly interpret he elements of the sentences.The very same devices that create these depende, leies forinterpretation help distinguish olct intolrnation from new.
I\[ the use of acohesive element pre~.upposes the exnste~ce of another role=once el theelement lor its ir}terpretahon, tl~en tile hstener can be assured tltat theolher reference exists, and that the element =n question can beunderstood as old reformation.
lhurefore, that act at associatingseJltences through reference deponde.cies heips make the textunambiguous, arid cohcs=on can be seen to be a very important part oftext.3.
Lexical SubstitutionIn \[3\], Halliday and I-lasan cat.~log and discuss many devices usedin English to acmove cohes,on.
Fhese include refe;ence, substitutionellaDsis, and conjunction.
Another f.t, mily ut devices they discuss is know,-"as lexical substitulion.
\ ]he lexlcal substitution devices incorporated intoPaul are pronommalizatior,, s.perordinate substitution, and definite nounphrase reiteration.Superordinate substitution is the replacement of an etement with anoun or phrase that ps a .
;ore general term for the element As anexample, consPder Figure 1, a sample hierarchy the system uses togenerate sentences.. .

The+ system tdeobfies an es;~e+~tial quality,usu\[\]liy ir=telligence, wilich acts as a block for further supurordinatesubsbtution.
If the item to be replaced with a superordmate has theprou.~rty of intelhgence, either d~reclly or through semantic inheritance, asuperordinate list is made only {)f tho..:e entnes that have themselves thequality el intothgenco, a{j.qir, either d~rectly or through inheritance.
If theitem does=rt have intelhgence the list is allowed to extend as far as thehierarcl~ical entries will allow.
Once the proper list of superordinates =3established, Paul randomly chooses one, preventing repetition byremembering previous choices.The other problem with superordinato substitution is that it may=ntroduce ambiguity.
Again cons=tier Figure 1.
If we wanted to perform asuperord.\]ato subshhlho;+ for POrJO.
we would have the sup~'rordJt13tehst (POSSUM MAMMAL ANIM4L ) to choose from.
But HEPZlI\]AH is also anlammal, so the rnammal cauld refer to either POGO or HEPZIBAH.
Andnot only are both POGO e,r}d ItEPZIBAtl anunals, but sn is CtlURCHY, sothe armnat could be any o,}e of them.
\]herefore, saying lhe matnmal orthe arr+mal would form an ambiguous refecence which the listener orreader would have rio v,,,ay to ur~derstand.Paul reco{.lniz??
\[hts ambiguity.
Once the superordinate has beenselected, it ~s tested against all the other nour~s mentioned so far in thetext If any other noun is a rn{;mbet of th.e superordu+ale set m question,the reference is ambl,~!uous.
1his reference can be disarnbiguated byusing some feature ot the eh:ment be,to replaced as a modilier.
In ourexample of Figure 1. we hrd that all possums are grey.
and thereforePOGO ~s grey.
Thus.
the grey mamma!
can refer only to POGO, and is notatnb=guous.
In the Pogo world, the features the system uses tod~sarr;oiuuate these references are gender, s~ze, color, and skin type(furry.

Or+co the leature ~s arb~trC.rily selected andthe correct value has been determined.

For instance, tl~esize of POGO ~s small, but s~ying the .~n',all mammal ~3 still ambiguousbec~use HEPZll~Atl is also small, and the phrase could just as likely referto her.
The search for a disambiguatmg ieature continues until one isfound.Pronominalizat+on, the use of personal pronouns in place of anelement, is mechan~c~dly simple.
The selecbon of the appropriatepersnnal pronoun is strictly gramm;-~lical.
Once lhe syntactic case, theoendor, and the number of the element are known, the correct pronoun isdictated by the language.the final ~ex~cal substitution available to Paul is the definite nounphrase, the use of a dehnite artielr~, t,'~e m English, as opposed to anindefinlle article, a or some The definite ~rticle clearly marks an item aserie that has been pre,~iously mentioned, and is therefore old information.

Nolhing has been said about howthe system chooses WlllCh IOxICUl substilutlor'i to use.
This is a seriousissue because lexlcGI sLJbsbtutiol~ dOWCOS ace nc;t interchangeable.
This istru.,3, bec;~u:;e le~Jcal substiluhons, as Wltll most cohesive devices, createtext by using pze:;uppo-~t;d dependencies tor Iheir inlerpreti'|tioi1s, as wehave seeri.
If those pr?~Supposod elemeats do not exist, or if it is notpossible to Correctly idcnhly whtch of the m~'.ny possiDle elements is theone presuppns,.xi, then it is imoossiblo to correctly int(,rpret he element,arid the only possd.
)le r?su!t ~s cunlus~on.
A computer text generationsymptom mat incorporates lexical substituhon in its output must insure thattne presupposed element ex:sts, and that it can be readily identified bythe reader.Pa~d controls the se!ection of lexicai substitution devices byconceptually dividing the p+ helen rote two I'.,sks.
"rho first is to ~dentify thestrength of antecedence rucov'crv of toO lexical substitution devices.
Thesecond ~s to iderztffy the str~..ngth el pote~:hal arrteceder~ce of eachelement in the passage, and determine which il any Icxical substitutionwould be appropriate.4.
Strength of Antecedence RecoveryEach time a cohesive devic~ is used, a presupposition clependencyis created.
rhe itef~ tIlat i:; being presupposed must be correctlyidentified tor the correct interp~etabon of the element.
The relative easewith wh=ch one c3n recover this pre~supposed item from the cohesiveelement is called the strength el antecedence recove,y.
The stronger aneleraent's strength of antecedence recovery, the easier it is to identify thepresupposed element.The lexical substitution with the highest strength of antece-loncerecovery is the dehnite noun.
This is because the element is actually arecetition of the original item, w~th a definite article to mark the fact that itis old information.
There is no real need to refer to the presupposedelement, since all the reformation is being repeated.Superordinate subslitution is the lexical substitution witl; the nexthighest strength of antecedence recovery.
Presupposition oepondencygenuinely does ernst with Ihe use of superordmates, because someintorrnation is lost When w* ~.
move up the semanhc hierarchy, all the traitsthat are specihc to the element in question are test.
To recover this andfully understand the ret(;rence at Ilano.
we must trace back to the originalelement in the hierarchy.
Fortunately, the manner in which Paul pedormssuporordmate substitution faohtates this recovery.
By insunng that thesuperordmate substitt;tlon will never be ambiguous, the system onlygenerates suporofdmate ~L, bstttutlons that are readily recoverable.The th,d device used by Paul.
~he personal pronoun, has the loweststrength of antecedence recovery.
Pronouns genuinely ~re nothing moretharl plat:e holders, variables that lea=tHole the pnsihotls Of the elementsthey are replacing A pronoun contains no real semahhc irdormation.
Theonly readily available p~eces of iniormation from a pronoun are thesyntactic role Jn the currenl sentence, the gender, and the number of thereplaced item.
For this mason, pronouns are the hardest to recover of thesubstitutions discussed.5.
Strength of Potential AntecedenceWl~tle the forms of lexical substitution provide clues (tO variousdegrees) teat aid the reader in recovering the presupposed elemeflt, theactual way m which the e!orr;er;t =S currerttly being used, how ;t wasprev;:)usly used.
its cir,,:um,~ tances within the current sentence and withinthe eqt~re text, can prowce addit;on31 clues.
These factors combine togive tne 5pecIhc reference a s~ret;gth el potentiat antecedence.
Someetemer~ts, try the ;,ature of their current and previous us~.~ge, will be easierto recover u;depetl~ont of u~e fox,cat subst~lutton dewce selected.Strength of potential antecedence involves several factors, One isthe syntachc role the element ~s pl~ying in tr}e current sentence, as wellas in the previous relere;ice.
Anoti~er is the d~stance of the previousreference from the current.
Here distance is defined as the number ofclauses between the references, and Paul arbitrarily uses a distance of nomore than two clauses as an acceptable distance.
The current expected382focus of the text also affects an element's potential strength ofantecedence.
In order to identify the current expected locus, Paul usesthe detailed algorithm for focus developed by Sidner \[10\].Paul identifies five classes of potenhal antecedence strength.
ClassI being the strongest and Class V the weakest, as well as a sixth "non-class" for elements being mentioned for the first time.
These five classesare shown in Figure 2.Class h1.

A referent that has been previously mentioned, OR2.
A referent that is a member of a previously mentioned set that hasbeen mentioned within an acceptable distance.Class V:A referent that is known to be a part of a previously mentioned item.F~gure 2: The Five Classes of Potential AntecedenceOnce an element's class of potential antecedence is identified, Iheselection of the proper toxical substitubon IS easy.

Note that Class I11 elementsare unusual i~ that the device used to replace them can vary.
If theprevious instance of the element was of Chtss I. if it was replaced with apronoun, then the Cunent instance =s replaced with a pror~oun, too.Othorwh'e, Class III elements are replaced with superordinates, the sameas Class I1.Class I .
