The lexical patterns of com-pound and conjunct verbs are extractedbased on the information of shallowmorphology and available seed lists ofverbs.
Lexical scopes of compound andconjunct verbs in consecutive sequenceof Complex Predicates (CPs) havebeen identified.
The fine-grained erroranalysis through confusion matrixhighlights some insufficiencies of lexi-cal patterns and the impacts of differentconstraints that are used to identify theComplex Predicates (CPs).
Systemachieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and77.92% for compound verbs and89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbsrespectively on two types of Bengalicorpus.1 IntroductionComplex Predicates (CPs) contain [verb] +verb (compound verbs) or [noun/adjective/adverb] +verb (conjunct verbs)combinations in South Asian languages (Hook,1974).
To the best of our knowledge, Bengaliis not only a language of South Asia but alsothe sixth popular language in the World 1 ,second in India and the national language ofBangladesh.
The identification of ComplexPredicates (CPs) adds values for buildinglexical resources (e.g.
WordNet (Miller et al,1990; VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)),parsing strategies and machine translationsystems.Bengali is less computerized compared toEnglish due to its morphological enrichment.As the identification of Complex Predicates(CPs) requires the knowledge of morphology,the task of automatically extracting the Com-plex Predicates (CPs) is a challenge.
ComplexPredicates (CPs) in Bengali consists of twotypes, compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunctverbs (ConjVs).The compound verbs (CompVs) (e.g.
?
???
??
mere phela ?kill?, ????
????
bolte laglo?started saying?)
consist of two verbs.
The firstverb is termed as Full Verb (FV) that is presentat surface level either as conjunctive participialform -e ?e or the infinitive form -?
?te.
Thesecond verb bears the inflection based onTense, Aspect and Person.
The second verbsthat are termed as Light Verbs (LV) arepolysemous, semantically bleached andconfined into some definite candidate seeds(Paul, 2010).On the other hand, each of the Bengali con-junct verbs (ConjVs) (e.g.
????
???
bharsha1http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size37kara ?to depend?, ????
???
jhakjhak kara ?toglow?)
consists of noun or adjective followedby a Light Verb (LV).
The Light Verbs (LVs)bear the appropriate inflections based onTense, Aspect and Person.According to the definition of multi-wordexpressions (MWEs)(Baldwin and Kim, 2010),the absence of conventional meaning of theLight Verbs in Complex Predicates (CPs)entails us to consider the Complex Predicates(CPs) as MWEs (Sinha, 2009).
But, there aresome typical examples of Complex Predicates(CPs), e.g.
?
??
???
dekha kara ?see-do?
thatbear the similar lexical pattern as Full Verb(FV)+ Light Verb (LV) but both of the FullVerb (FV) and Light Verb (LV) loose theirconventional meanings and generate acompletely different meaning (?to meet?
in thiscase).In addition to that, other types of predicatessuch as ????
?
?
niye gelo ?take-go?
(took andwent), ????
?
?
diye gelo ?give-go?
(gave andwent) follows the similar lexical patternsFV+LV as of Complex Predicates (CPs) butthey are not mono-clausal.
Both the Full Verb(FV) and Light Verb (LV) behave likeindependent syntactic entities and they belongto non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs).
Theverbs are also termed as Serial Verb (SV)(Mukherjee et al, 2006).Butt (1993) and Paul (2004) have alsomentioned the following criteria that are usedto check the validity of complex predicates(CPs) in Bengali.
The following cases are theinvalid criteria of complex predicates (CPs).1.
Control Construction (CC): ?????
??
?likhte bollo ?asked to write?, ?????
???????
likhte badhyo korlo ?forced towrite?2.
Modal Control Construction (MCC):?
??
???
jete hobe ?have to go?
?
??
??
?khete hobe ?have to eat?3.
Passives (Pass) : ???
???
dhora porlo?was caught?, ????
??
mara holo ?wasbeaten?4.
Auxiliary Construction (AC): ???
??
?bose ache ?is sitting?, ????
???
niye chilo?had taken?.Sometimes, the successive sequence of theComplex Predicates (CPs) shows a problem ofdeciding the scopes of individual ComplexPredicates (CPs) present in that sequence.
Forexample the sequence, u??
???
?
????
uthe poredekhlam ?rise-wear-see?
(rose and saw) seemsto contain two Complex Predicates (CPs) (u?????
uthe pore ?rose?
and ???
?
????
poredekhlam ?wore and see?).
But there is actuallyone Complex Predicate (CP).
The first one u?????
uthe pore ?rose?
is a compound verb(CompV) as well as a Complex Predicate (CP).Another one is ?
????
dekhlam ?saw?
that is asimple verb.
As the sequence is not mono-clausal, the Complex Predicate (CP) u??
??
?uthe pore ?rose?
associated with ?
????
dekhlam?saw?
is to be separated by a lexical boundary.Thus the determination of lexical scopes ofComplex Predicates (CPs) from a long con-secutive sequence is indeed a crucial task.The present task therefore not only aims toextract the Complex Predicates (CPs)containing compound and conjunct verbs butalso to resolve the problem of deciding thelexical scopes automatically.
The compoundverbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs)are extracted from two separate Bengalicorpora based on the morphologicalinformation (e.g.
participle forms, infinitiveforms and inflections) and list of Light Verbs(LVs).
As the Light Verbs (LVs) in thecompound verbs (CompVs) are limited innumber, fifteen predefined verbs (Paul, 2010)are chosen as Light Verbs (LVs) for framingthe compound verbs (CompVs).
A manuallyprepared seed list that is used to frame thelexical patterns for conjunct verbs (ConjVs)contains frequently used Light Verbs (LVs).An automatic method is designed to identifythe lexical scopes of compound and conjunctverbs in the long sequences of ComplexPredicates (CPs).
The identification of lexicalscope of the Complex Predicates (CPs)improves the performance of the system as thenumber of identified Complex Predicates(CPs) increases.Manual evaluation is carried out on twotypes of Bengali corpus.
The experiments arecarried out on 800 development sentencesfrom two corpora but the final evaluation iscarried out on 1000 sentences.
Overall, thesystem achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively.38The error analysis shows that not only thelexical patterns but also the augmentation ofargument structure agreement (Das, 2009), theanalysis of Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) orSerial Verb, Control Construction (CC),Modal Control Construction (MCC), Passives(Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) (Butt,1993; Paul, 2004) are also necessary toidentify the Complex Predicates (CPs).
Theerror analysis shows that the system suffers indistinguishing the Complex Predicates (CPs)from the above constraint constructions.The rest of the paper is organized as fol-lows.
Section 2 describes the related workdone in this area.
The automatic extraction ofcompound and conjunct verbs is described inSection 3.
In Section 4, the identification oflexical scopes of the Complex Predicates(CPs) is mentioned.
Section 5 discusses theresults of evaluation along with error analysis.Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.2 Related WorkThe general theory of complex predicate isdiscussed in Alsina (1996).
Several attemptshave been organized to identify complexpredicates in South Asian languages (Abbi,1991; Bashir, 1993; Verma, 1993) with a spe-cial focus to Hindi (Burton-Page, 1957; Hook,1974), Urdu (Butt, 1995), Bengali (Sarkar,1975; Paul, 2004), Kashmiri (Kaul, 1985) andOriya (Mohanty, 1992).
But the automatic ex-traction of Complex Predicates (CPs) has beencarried out for few languages, especiallyHindi.The task described in (Mukherjee et al,2006) highlights the development of a databasebased on the hypothesis that an English verb isprojected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi.The simple idea of projecting POS tags acrossan English-Hindi parallel corpus considers theComplex Predicate types, adjective-verb (AV),noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), andverb-verb (VV) composites.
A similar task(Sinha, 2009) presents a simple method fordetecting Complex Predicates of all kinds us-ing a Hindi-English parallel corpus.
His simplestrategy exploits the fact that Complex Predi-cate is a multi-word expression with a meaningthat is distinct from the meaning of the LightVerb.
In contrast, the present task carries theidentification of Complex Predicates (CPs)from monolingual Bengali corpus based onmorphological information and lexical pat-terns.The analysis of V+V complex predicatestermed as lexical compound verbs (LCpdVs)and the linguistic tests for their detection inHindi are described in (Chakrabarti et al,2008).
In addition to compound verbs, the pre-sent system also identifies the conjunct verbsin Bengali.
But, it was observed that the identi-fication of Hindi conjunct verbs that containnoun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore asophisticated solution was proposed in (Das,2009) based on the control agreement strategywith other overtly case marked noun phrases.The present task also agrees with the aboveproblem in identifying conjunct verbs in Ben-gali although the system satisfactorily identi-fies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs).Paul (2003) develops a constraint-basedmechanism within HPSG framework for com-posing Indo-Aryan compound verb construc-tions with special focus on Bangla (Bengali)compound verb sequences.
Postulating seman-tic relation of compound verbs, another work(Paul, 2009) proposed a solution of providinglexical link between the Full verb and LightVerb to store the Compound Verbs in IndoWordNet without any loss of generalization.To the best of our knowledge, ours is the firstattempt at automatic extraction of ComplexPredicates (CPs) in Bengali.3 Identification of Complex Predi-cates (CPs)The compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunctverbs (ConjVs) are identified from the shallowparsed result using a lexical pattern matchingtechnique.3.1 Preparation of CorporaTwo types of Bengali corpus have been con-sidered to carry out the present task.
One cor-pus is collected from a travel and tourism do-main and another from an online web archiveof Rabindranath Rachanabali 2 .
RabindraRachanabali corpus is a large collection ofshort stories of Rabindranath Tagore.
The for-2 www.rabindra-rachanabali.nltr.org39mer EILMT travel and tourism corpus is ob-tained from the consortium mode project ?De-velopment of English to Indian LanguagesMachine Translation (EILMT 3) System?.
Thesecond type of corpus is retrieved from theweb archive and pre-processed accordingly.Each of the Bengali corpora contains 400 and500 development and test sentences respec-tively.The sentences are passed through an opensource Bengali shallow parser 4.
The shallowparser gives different morphological informa-tion (root, lexical category of the root, gender,number, person, case, vibhakti, tam, suffixesetc.)
that help in identifying the lexical patternsof Complex Predicates (CPs).3.2 Extracting Complex Predicates (CPs)Manual observation shows that the ComplexPredicates (CPs) contain the lexical pattern{[XXX] (n/adj) [YYY] (v)} in the shallowparsed sentences where XXX and YYY repre-sent any word.
But, the lexical category of theroot word of XXX is either noun (n) or adjec-tive (adj) and the lexical category of the rootword of YYY is verb (v).
The shallow parsedsentences are pre-processed to generate thesimplified patterns.
An example of similarlexical pattern of the shallow parsed result andits simplified output is shown in Figure 1.

(e.g.

areshown in bold face in Figure 1.
The f ollowingexample is of conjunct verb (ConjV).The extraction of Bengali compound verbs(CompVs) is straightforward rather than con-junct verbs (ConjVs).
The lexical pattern ofcompound verb is {[XXX](v) [YYY] (v)} wherethe lexical or basic POS categories of the rootwords of  ?XXX?
and ?YYY?
are only verb.
Ifthe basic POS tags of the root forms of ?XXX?and ?YYY?
are verbs (v) in shallow parsed sen-tences, then only the corresponding lexicalpatterns are considered as the probable candi-dates of compound verbs (CompVs).Example 1:??i??|v??b|??i??/VM/VGNF/?
?
^v^*^*^?ny^*^i??^i??)#??????|v??b|??????/VM/VGF/(??^v^*^*^1^*^?^?
)Example 1 is a compound verb (CompV) butExample 2 is not.
In Example 2, the lexicalcategory or the basic POS of the Full Verb(FV) is noun (n) and hence the pattern is dis-carded as non-compound verb (non-CompV).Example 2:?k?
|noun|?k?
/NN/NP/(?k?
^n^*^*^*^*^*^poslcat="NM") #?????|verb|?????/VM/VGNF/(?r^v^*^*^any^*^i??^i??
)Bengali, like any other Indian languages, ismorphologically very rich.
Different suffixesmay be attached to a Light Verb (LVs) (in thiscase [YYY]) depending on the various featuressuch as Tense, Aspect, and Person.In case of extracting compound verbs(CompVs), the Light Verbs are identified froma seed list (Paul, 2004).
The list of Light Verbsis specified in Table 1.
The dictionary forms ofthe Light Verbs are stored in this list.
As theLight Verbs contain different suffixes, the pri-mary task is to identify the root forms of theLight Verbs (LVs) from shallow parsed result.Another table that stores the root forms and thecorresponding dictionary forms of the LightVerbs is used in the present task.
The tablecontains a total number of 378 verb entriesincluding Full Verbs (FVs) and Light Verbs(LVs).
The dictionary forms of the Light Verbs(LVs) are retrieved from the Table.On the other hand, the conjunctive particip-ial form -e/i??
-e/iya or the infinitive form -?
/i??
?te/ite are attached with the Full Verbs40(FVs) (in this case [XXX]) in compound verbs(CompVs).
i??
/ iya and i?
?/ ite are also usedfor conjunctive participial form -e ?e or theinfinitive form -?
?te respectively in litera-ture.
The participial and infinitive forms arechecked based on the morphological informa-tion (e.g.
suffixes of the verb) given in theshallow parsed results.
In Example 1, the FullVerb (FV) contains -i??
-iya suffix.
If the dic-tionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) are pre-sent in the list of Light Verbs and the FullVerbs (FVs) contain the suffixes of -e/i??
-e/iya or ?
/i??
?te/ite, both verbs are combinedto frame the patterns of compound verbs(CompVs).aSa ?come?

List of Light Verbs for compoundverbs.The identification of conjunct verbs(ConjVs) requires the lexical pattern (Noun /Adjective + Light Verb) where a noun or anadjective is followed by a Light Verb (LV).
Thedictionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) thatare frequently used as conjunct verbs (ConjVs)are prepared manually.
The list of Light Verbs(LVs) is given in Table 2.
The detection ofLight Verbs (LVs) for conjunct verbs (ConjVs)is similar to the detection of the Light Verbs(LVs) for compound verbs (CompVs) as de-scribed earlier in this section.
If the basic POSof the root of the first words ([XXX]) is either?noun?
or ?adj?
(n/adj) and the basic POS ofthe following word ([YYY]) is ?verb?
(v), thepatterns are considered as conjunct verbs(ConjVs).
The Example 2 is an example ofconjunct verb (ConjV).For example, ????
???
(jhakjhak kara ?toglow?
), ????
???
(taktak ?to glow?
), ??
???
???
(chupchap kara ?to silent?)
etc are identified asconjunct verbs (ConjVs) where the basic POSof the former word is an adjective (adj) fol-lowed by ???
kara ?to do?, a common LightVerb.deoya ?give?
kara  ?do?neoya ?take?

List of Light Verbs for conjunct verbs.Example 3:????|?dj|????

^?dj) #????|v??b|????/VM/VGF/(?r^v^*^*^5^*^?^?
)But, the extraction of conjunct verbs(ConjVs) that have a ?noun+verb?
constructionis descriptively and theoretically puzzling(Das, 2009).
The identification of lexical pat-terns is not sufficient to recognize the com-pound verbs (CompVs).
For example, ?i ?
??
?boi deoya ?give book?
and ????
?
???
bharsadeyoa ?to assure?
both contain similar lexicalpattern (noun+verb) and same Light Verb ?
???deyoa.
But, ????
?
???
bharsa deyoa ?to assure?is a conjunct verb (ConjV) whereas ?i ?
???
boideoya ?give book?
is not a conjunct verb(ConjV).
Linguistic observation shows that theinclusion of this typical category into conjunctverbs (ConjVs) requires the additional knowl-edge of syntax and semantics.In connection to conjunct verbs (ConjVs),(Mohanty, 2010) defines two types of conjunctverbs (ConjVs), synthetic and analytic.
A syn-thetic conjunct verb is one in which both theconstituents form an inseparable whole fromthe semantic point of view or semanticallynon-compositional in nature.
On the otherhand, an analytic conjunct verb is semanticallycompositional.
Hence, the identification ofconjunct verbs requires knowledge of seman-tics rather than only the lexical patterns.It is to be mentioned that sometimes, thenegative markers (??
no, ?
?i nai) are attachedwith the Light Verbs u?????
uthona ?do not getup?
?
?????
phelona ?do not throw?.
Negativeattachments are also considered in the presenttask while checking the suffixes of Light Verbs(LVs).4 Identification of Lexical Scope forComplex Predicates (CPs)The identification of lexical scopes of theComplex Predicates (CPs) from their succes-sive sequences shows that multiple Complex41Predicates (CPs) can occur in a long sequence.An automatic method is employed to identifythe Complex Predicates (CPs) along with theirlexical scopes.
The lexical category or basicPOS tags are obtained from the parsed sen-tences.If the compound and conjunct verbs occursuccessively in a sequence, the left most twosuccessive tokens are chosen to construct theComplex Predicate (CP).
If successive verbsare present in a sequence and the dictionaryform of the second verb reveals that the verb ispresent in the lists of compound Light Verbs(LV), then that Light Verb (LV) may be a partof a compound verb (CompV).
For that reason,the immediate previous word token is chosenand tested for its basic POS in the parsed result.If the basic POS of the previous word is ?verb(v)?
and any suffixes of either conjunctive par-ticipial form -e/i??
-e/iya or the infinitive form-?
/i??
?te/ite is attached to the previous verb,the two successive verbs are grouped togetherto form a compound verb (CompV) and thelexical scope is fixed for the Complex Predi-cate (CP).If the previous verb does not contain -e/i?
?-e/iya or -?
/i??
?te/ite inflections, no com-pound verb (CompV) is framed with these twoverbs.
But, the second Light Verb (LV) may bea part of another Complex Predicate (CP).
ThisLight Verb (LV) is now considered as the FullVerb (FV) and its immediate next verb issearched in the list of compound Light Verbs(LVs) and the formation of compound verbs(CompVs) progresses similarly.
If the verb isnot in the list of compound Light Verbs, thesearch begins by considering the present verbas Full Verb (FV) and the search goes in asimilar way.The following examples are given to illus-trate the formation of compound verbs(CompVs) and find the lexical scopes of thecompound verbs (CompVs).???
????
????
???
?
???
(ami)       (chalte)      (giye)    (pore)    (gelam).I <fell down while walking>.Here, ?chalte giye pore gelam?
is a verbgroup.
The two left most verbs ????
????
chaltegiye are picked and the dictionary form of thesecond verb is searched in the list of com-pound Light Verbs.
As the dictionary form(jaoya ?go?)
of the verb ????
giye is present inthe list of compound Light Verbs (as shown inTable 1), the immediate previous verb ???
?chalte is checked for inflections -e/i??
-e/iyaor -?
/i??
?te/ite.
As the verb ????
chalte con-tains the inflection -?
-te , the verb group ????????
chalte giye is a compound verb (CompV)where ????
giye is a Light Verb and ????
chalteis the Full Verb with inflection (-?
-te).
Nextverb group, ???
?
???
pore gelam is identifiedas compound verb (CompV) in a similar way(?
?+ (-e) por+ (-e) + ?
???
gelam (jaoya ?go?
)).Another example is given as follows.???
u??
???
?
????
?
(ami)   (uthe)      (pore)      (dekhlam)    (je)??
??
e????
?
i(tumi)     (ekhane)       (nei)I <get up and saw> that you are not hereHere, u??
???
?
????
uthe pore dekhlam isanother verb group.
The immediate next verbof u??
uthe is ???
pore that is chosen and itsdictionary form is searched in the list of com-pound Light Verbs (LV) similarly.
As the dic-tionary form (???
pOra) of the verb ???
poreis present in the list of Light Verbs and theverb u??
uthe contains the inflection -e ?e,the consecutive verbs frame a compound verb(CompV) u??
???
where u??
uthe is a Full Verbwith inflection -e ?e and ???
pore is a LightVerb.
The final verb ?
????
dekhlam ischosen and as there is no other verb present,the verb ?
????
dekhlam is excluded from anyformation of compound verb (CompV) by con-sidering it as a simple verb.Similar technique is adopted for identifyingthe lexical scopes of conjunct verbs (ConjVs).The method seems to be a simple patternmatching technique in a left-to-right fashionbut it helps in case of conjunct verbs (ConjVs).As the noun or adjective occur in the first slotof conjunct verbs (ConjVs) construction, thesearch starts from the point of noun or adjec-tive.
If the basic POS of a current token is ei-ther ?noun?
or ?adjective?
and the dictionaryform of the next token with the basic POS?verb (v)?
is in the list of conjunct Light Verbs(LVs), then the two consecutive tokens are42combined to frame the pattern of a conjunctverb (ConjV).For example, the identification of lexicalscope of a conjunct verb (ConjV) from a se-quence such as u????
????
?
???
uparjon kortegelam ?earn-do-go?
(went to earn) identifiesthe conjunct verb (ConjV) u????
????
uparjonkorte.
There is another verb group ????
?
??
?korte gelam that seems to be a compound verb(CompV) but is excluded by considering ??
??
?gelam as a simple verb.5 EvaluationThe system is tested on 800 development sen-tences and finally applied on a collection of500 sentences from each of the two Bengalicorpora.
As there is no annotated corpus avail-able for evaluating Complex Predicates (CPs),the manual evaluation of total 1000 sentencesfrom the two corpora is carried out in the pre-sent task.The recall, precision and F-Score are con-sidered as the standard metrics for the presentevaluation.
The extracted Complex Predicates(CPs) contain compound verb (CompV) andconjunct verbs (ConjVs).
Hence, the metricsare measured for both types of verbs individu-ally.
The separate results for two separate cor-pora are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 respec-tively.
The results show that the system identi-fies the Complex Predicates (CPs) satisfacto-rily from both of the corpus.
In case of Com-pound Verbs (CompVs), the precision value ishigher than the recall.
The lower recall valueof Compound Verbs (CompVs) signifies thatthe system fails to capture the other instancesfrom overlapping sequences as well as non-Complex predicates (non-CPs).But, it is observed that the identification oflexical scopes of compound verbs (CompVs)and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) from long se-quence of successive Complex Predicates(CPs) increases the number of Complex Predi-cates (CPs) entries along with compound verbs(CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs).
Thefigures shown in bold face in Table 3 and Ta-ble 4 for the Travel and Tourism corpus andShort Story corpus of Rabindranath Tagoreindicates the improvement of identifying lexi-cal scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs).In comparison to other similar languagesuch as Hindi (Mukerjee et al, 2006) (the re-ported precision and recall are 83% and 46%respectively), our results (84.66% precisionand 83.67% recall) are higher in case of ex-tracting Complex Predicates (CPs).
The reasonmay be of resolving the lexical scope and han-dling the morphosyntactic features using shal-low parser.In addition to Non-MonoClausal Verb(NMCV) or Serial Verb, the other criteria(Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are used in our pre-sent diagnostic tests to identify the complexpredicates (CPs).
The frequencies ofCompound Verb (CompV), Conjunct Verb(ConjV) and the instances of other constraintsof non Complex Predicates (non-CPs) areshown in Figure 2.
It is observed that the num-bers of instances of Conjunct Verb (ConjV),Passives (Pass), Auxiliary Construction (AC)and Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or SerialVerb are comparatively high than other in-stances in both of the corpus.EILMT  Recall Precision F-ScoreCompoundVerb(CompV)65.92%70.31%80.11%82.06%72.32%75.73%ConjunctVerb(ConjV)94.65%96.96%80.44%83.82%86.96%89.90%Table 3.

In case of con-junct verbs (ConjVs), the Non-MonoClausalVerbs (NMCV) and Auxiliary Construction(AC) occur as conjunct verbs (ConjVs).
Thesystem also suffers from clausal detection thatis not attempted in the present task.
The Pas-sives (Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC)requires the knowledge of semantics with ar-gument structure knowledge.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a study ofBengali Complex Predicates (CPs) with a spe-cial focus on compound verbs, proposed auto-matic methods for their extraction from a cor-pus and diagnostic tests for their evaluation.The problem arises in case of distinguishingComplex Predicates (CPs) from Non-Mono-Clausal verbs, as only the lexical patterns areinsufficient to identify the verbs.
In future task,the subcategorization frames or argumentstructures of the sentences are to be identifiedfor solving the issues related to the errors ofthe present system.ReferencesAbbi, Anvita.
