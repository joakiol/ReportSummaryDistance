THE MURASAKI PROJECT: MULTILINGUALNATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDINGChinatsu Aone, Hatte Blejer, Sharon Flank, Douglas McKee, Sandy ShinnSystems Research  and Appl icat ions  (SRA)2000 15th Street NorthAr l ington,  VA 22201ABSTRACTThis paper describes a multilingual data extraction system underdevelopment for the Department of Defense (Do\[)).
The system,called Murasa.ki, processes Spanish and Japanese newspaper a ticlesreporting AIDS disease statistics.
Key to Murasaki's design is itslanguage-independent and domain-independent architecture.
Thesystem consists of shared processing modules across the threelanguages it currently handles (English, Japanese, and Spanish),shared general and domain-specific knowledge bases, and separatedata modules for language-specific knowledge such as grammars,lexicons, morphological data and discourse data.
This data-drivenarchitecture is crucial to the success of Murasaki as a language-independent system; extending Murasaki to additional languagescan be done for the most part merely by adding new data.
Some ofthe data can be added with user-friendly tools, others by exploitingexisting on-line data or by deriving relevant data from corpora.I .
INTRODUCTIONProject Murasaki s a 30-month project for DoD to design anddevelop adata extraction prototype, operative in Spanish andJapanese and extensible to other languages.
Using SRA's corenatural language processing (NLP) software, SOLOMON,Project Murasaki extracts information from newspaper ar-ticles and TV transcripts in Japanese and from newspaperarticles from a variety of Spanish-speaking countries.
Thetopic of the articles and transcripts i the disease AIDS.
Theextracted information- some in a canonical form and someas it appears in the input texts - is stored in an object-oriented atabase schema implemented in a recently releasedmultilingual version of the Sybase RDBMS.Project Murasaki has been under development since Octo-ber 1990 and will be delivered to DoD in June 1993.
Thegoal of the project was to extend SOLOMON's data extrac-tion capabilities, hitherto used for English texts, to Spanishand Japanese.
It was explicitly requested that Murasaki beas language-independent anddomain-independent as possi-ble and be extensible to additional languages and domainsultimately.SOLOMON reflects six years of development.
From itsinception, language and domain independence have beendeliberate design goals.
Murasaki was our first extensive useof SOLOMON for languages other than English and thus thefirst testing-ground for its claimed language independence.SOL()MON had been used and continues to be used acrossa variety of domains over the past six years.
In the MUC-4conference, SRA demonstrated a single system extractinginformation about Latin American terrorism from newspaperarticles in all three languages, using Spanish and Japanese datamodules developed for Murasaki and terrorism vocabulary inSpanish and Japanese acquired in the two weeks prior to thedemonstration (cf.
\[1, 2\]).SOLOMON's architecture did not change significantly duringthe course of Murasaki.
For the most part, its claim tolanguage independence was borne out.
Below, we willdiscuss how we have extended it to increase its languageindependence.2.
UNIQUE FEATURES OF  MURASAKI2.1.
Modular  ArchitectureMurasaki s composed of shared processing modules acrossthe three languages upported by separate data modules,as shown in Figure 1.
Murasaki has six processing mod-ules: PREPROCESSING, SYNTAX, SEMANTICS, DIS-COURSE, PRAGMATICS, and EXTRACT.
Each of thesemodules has associated data.
For example:PREPROCESSING:SYNTAX:SEMANTICS:DISCOURSE:PRAGMATICS:EXTRACT:lexicons, patterns, morphological datagrammarsknowledge basesdiscourse knowledge sourcesinference rulesextract dataModularity is crucial to the reusability and extensibility ofMurasaki.
It facilitates, on the one hand, reuse of parts ofMurasaki and on the other hand replacement of parts of thesystem.We have been able to reuse portions of SOLOMON in thepast, and expect o be able to pull modules out of Murasakiand use them separately as warranted in the future.
Forinstance, PREPROCESSING could be used in isolation inmultilingual information retrieval applications.Conversely, modules - both processing and data modules -144.ext .

In order to port Murasaki toMUC-4 Latin American terrorism domain, we replaced theJapanese and Spanish AIDS domain lexicons with Japaneseand Spanish terrorism domain lexicons, resulting in a systemwhich understood Spanish and Japanese newspaper articleson terrorism in a matter of weeks.
Since the terrorismdomain knowledge bases (KB's) were developed for Englishfor MUC-4 already, and since the KB's can be shared acrosslanguages, there was no need to change or add KB's in thiscase.In addition to plugging in new data modules, we have suc-cessfully replaced single processing modules, (separately) atvarious times, such as PREPROCESSING, SEMANTICS,DISCOURSE and EXTRACT without changes to the othermodules.
In addition, we added an entirely new modulePRAGMATICS in the past year.
In no case were extensivechanges to other parts of the system required.Finally, in developing NLP systems it is crucial to be able toisolate the source of system errors during development andtesting.
While black-box testing can indicate how the systemis performing overall, only glass-box (module-level) testingcan focus on the source of errors in such a way as to aid thedevelopers.
Murasaki's modular architecture has facilitatedsuch glass-box testing.2.2.
Data -dr iven  Arch i tec tureEach Murasaki processing module is data-driven.
Data mod-ules are specific to the language, domain, or application.Keeping the data modules eparate isan essential factor in thesystem's success as a multilingual system.
We have been ableto isolate the majority of the language-specific knowledgeto the data modules associated with PREPROCESSING (i.e.lexicons, patterns, morphological data) and SYNTAX (i.e.grammars).
SEMANTICS is entirely language-independent,and DISCOURSE isolates the small amount of language-specific information to the discourse data module (i.e.
dis-course knowledge sources).Thus, in order to port to a new language, the following subsetof the data modules are necessary:PREPROCESSING:SYNTAX:DISCOURSE:lexicons, patterns, morphological datagrammarsdiscourse knowledge sourcesTo facilitate data acquisition in multiple languages, we havebeen developing language-independent automatic data acqui-sition algorithms \[3, 4\].
Also, in order to improve the qualityof grammars, we have adapted a grammar evaluation tool(PARSEVAL) to evaluate the performance ofour Spanish andJapanese grammars on texts bracketed by the Penn Treebankbracketing tool.3.
MULT IL INGUAL MODULESIn this section, we discuss what we have done to the processingmodules in Murasaki n order for them to handle multilingualinput.3.1.
P reprocess ingMurasaki replaced its original morphological nalyzer with amultilingual morphological nalyzer.
The new analyzer con-sists of a morphological processing engine and morphologicaldata for each language, as shown in Figure 2.
In order to adda new language, one only has to add morphological data for145VSTEM TENUMPERS ER-VERB PRETERITcorn eryo com !'it!

This approach is especially useful for highlyinflected languages like Spanish and Japanese.After morphological nalysis, pattern matching is performedto recognize multi-word phrases like numbers, date, personalnames, organization ames, and so on.
Although specificpatterns to recognize, for example, Japanese and Spanishpersonal names are different, the same pattern matchingengine and pattern specification language are used for allthe languages.
Examples of phrases recognized by Spanishpatterns are shown in Figure 3, using SGML markers.3.2.
SyntaxIn order to make the syntax module language-independent,Murasaki extended the Tomita parsing algorithm \[5\] to dealwith ambiguous word boundaries in Japanese.
These bound-aries are problematic because there is no space between wordsin a Japanese sentence, and it can be segmented in more thanone way.
Our implementation f the algorithm was originallytoken-based, where a token was a word or phrase.
The ex-tended algorithm is character-based, and now allows variablelength input.The same X-bar-based grammar specification language forEnglish has been used to write the Spanish and Japanesegrammars.
In addition, all the grammars call the sameconstraint functions to check syntactic subcategorization andsemantic type restrictions during parsing.
Skeletal rules canbe provided for a new language to start with especially whenthe new language is structurally similar to the languages ofthe existing grammars (e.g.
Portuguese).
In fact, much of#~054 09ago89 Exce ls io r -da lapa  pa labras  218E1 nu 'mero  de ca$os  de sida en la ent idadaumento'  a 326, con los 15 detectado~ durante?

English andSpanish) and head-final languages (e.g.
Japanese) are shownin Figure 4.1The output of the parser is a structure called a functionallylabeled template (FIX), which is similar to LFG's f-structure.The FLT specification language is language-independent.
Ituses grammatical functions like subject, object, etc.
as regis-ters, but no language-specific information such as precedenceis present at this level.
Thus, while Spanish texts often useinversion as in "... yen total se han registrado cuarenta y sietecasts con treinta v{ctimas", it is not the case with English,e.g.
".. and in total 47 cases with 30 victims were recorded.
"However, such differences are normalized in FLT's.The FIX specification has been extended and tested to coverphenomena in three languages as Spanish and Japanese gram-mars are developed.
Itmustbe general and expressive enoughto cover linguistic phenomena in multiple languages becausethe semantic interpretation expects its input in any languageto follow this specification.
For example, quantity phrases(QP's) in any languages now have a unit register in the FLT.In English and Spanish, measure units in measure phrases fillthe unit values (e.g.
"3 pints of blood", "62 por ciento delas personas con sida").
In Japanese, so-called classifiers fillin the unit values.
Classifiers are used to count any objectsin Japanese, including discrete objects such as people andcompanies.
Such unit information is sometimes important forsemantic disambiguation.Once broad-coverage rammars are developed, they can beused to process texts in any domain (unless the domain usesa sublanguage) without much modification, since linguisticstructures of languages do not change from domain to domain.The only difference between domains is the weights on eachrule because the frequency of using particular rules changes,just as the frequency of particular words changes in differentdomains.
Thus, the same Spanish and Japanese grammarsdeveloped for the AIDS domain were used to process Spanishand Japanese texts in the MUC-4 (terrorism) domain with aIGMOD stands for General MODifier, NCOMPS for Noun COMPle-mentS, and PARTP for PARTicle Phrase.
The Arabic numerals indicate barlevels.146few additional rules.3.3.
SemanticsMurasaki has a single semantics processing module for allthe languages.
It takes as input output of the syntax mod-ule in the FLT format.
Thus, so long as the input to thesemantics processing module conforms to the FLT specifica-tion, Murasaki can use different grammars or parsers.
Thesemantics processing module uses core and domain-specificknowledge bases (KB's) common to all languages to per-form semantic disambiguation and inference, and outputslanguage-independent KB objects.In moving from English to multiple languages, English spe-cific information was moved from the KB's to the lex-icons.
Our KB's originally encoded both semantic andEnglish-specific syntactic information (e.g.
subcategorizationinformation).
We moved the language-specific syntactic in-formation from the KB's to English lexicons, and left thelanguage-independent s mantic type information i the KB's.In addition, the semantics processing module itself has be-come more data-driven tobe morelanguage-independent.
Forexample, interpretation f the complements of nominalizedverbs among three languages became language-independentby classifying pre/postpositions of these languages into com-mon semantic lasses.
Thus, AGENT roles of nominalizedverbs are typically expressed by AGENT markers (e.g.
"by","por", "niyoru") of given languages, and THEME roles byNEUTRAL markers (e.g.
"of", "de", "no").AGENT THEMEEg investigation by WHO transmission ofAIDSSp investigaci6 n por WHO transmisi6n de SIDAJp WHO-niyoru chousa AIDS-no kansenA more general, data-driven approach has been alsotaken for semantic disambiguation necessary to interpretpre/postpositional phrases, compound nouns, appositives etc.which are common for all the languages.
In all cases of se-mantic disambiguation, the same knowledge-based strategyis used to determine the most plausible relations betweentwo semantic objects.
For example, for noun phrases like"AIDS/cancer patients", "afectados de SIDA" (Spanish), or"AIDS kanja" (Japanese), a relation Has-Disease is chosenfrom the KB's for the two nouns.
Semantics of ambiguouspre/postpositions (e.g.
"in", "en") is determined in a similarway.
For sentences in (1) below, a relation Location ischosen, while for those in (2) a relation Time is chosen.

WAKARU)) )Figure 5: A Lexical Entry for "wakaru"The Murasaki semantics module uses four basic language-independent predicate-argument mapping rules called situa-tion types, which map syntactic arguments of verbs in FLT's(e.g.
subject, object, etc.)
to thematic roles of verb pred-icates in the KB's (e.g.
agent, theme, etc.
), as shown inTable 1.
Such mapping rules, along with any idiosyncraticmapping information, for each verb are derived from corporaautomatically (see \[4\] for more detail).For example, the English word "understand" uses what wecall INVERSE-STATE mapping, where the subject maps toGOAL and and the object THEME of the predicate #UN-DERSTAND#.
The Japanese semantic equivalent "wakaru"also uses the INVERSE-STATE mapping.
However, thelanguage-specific idiosyncratic nformation that the GOALrole can be also specified by a particle "hi" is stated in thelexicon.
As shown in Figure 5, the lexical entry for "wakaru"has pointers to its semantic predicate in a KB (i.e.
#UN-DERSTAND#) and its mapping rule (i.e.
INVERSE-STATE),and specifies its word-specific diosyncrasy information about"hi" in addition.3.4.
DiscourseThe Murasaki discourse module needed the most work tobe language-independent.
A discourse module is generallyleast developed in any NLP system, and our system was noexception.
In addition, some part of the module was designedto be English specific.
For example, since grammaticalgenders and natural genders usually coincide in English,the original discourse module paid attention only to naturalgenders.
However, in Spanish, grammatical genders of ananaphor and its antecedent, not the natural genders, must becompatible for them to co-refer.
For example, the third personfeminine pronoun "la" in the following sentence r fers to "latransmisi6n", which is not a semantic object with a femalegender: "En otras entidades como Baja California y Veracruzla transmisi6n en este grupo es 1.2 veces mayor que la queocurre a nivel nacional.
"Moreover, different languages have different types ofanaphora (e.g.
zero pronouns in Spanish and Japanese).

the antecedent of a Japanese anaphor"uchi" is found in the adjacent discourse clause).
Further-more, constraints on the antecedents differ from languageto language (e.g.
a Japanese third person masculine pronoun"kare" must refer to a male person, but not Spanish thirdperson masculine pronouns).We achieved the multilingual capability of the discoursemodule by dividing the anaphora resolution process into mul-tiple knowledge sources and using subsets of the knowledgesources to handle different discourse phenomena (cf.
\[6\]).Both the discourse knowledge sources and discourse phe-nomena are represented as objects in the KB's.
Thus, thediscourse processing module called Resolution Engine hasbecome strictly data-driven (cf.
Figure 6).The discourse knowledge source KB consists of generators(i.e.
various ways to generate antecedent hypotheses), filters(e.g.
syntactic number filter, syntactic gender filter, semanticamount filter, semantic gender filter, semantic type filter,etc.
), and orderers (e.g.
focus orderer, recency orderer, etc.
).Language-independence of the knowledge sources has beenachieved by dividing each knowledge source into language-specific data and language-independent processing functions.For example, the semantic gender filter has associated data forEnglish and Japanese, which specifies constraints on gendersof semantic objects imposed by certain pronouns (e.g.
English"he" cannot refer to semantic objects with female gender like"girl").
As explained above, Spanish does not use thesemantic gender filter but uses the syntactic gender filter.Finally, we wanted to be able to evaluate the performance ofthe Murasaki discourse module so that we can train it andmaximize its performance in different languages and domains.Our architecture allows anaphora resolution performance tobe evaluated and trained.
We use corpora tagged withdiscourse relations, as shown in Figure 7, for such evaluation.4.
CONCLUSIONWe have described a multilingual system, Murasaki, focus-ing on specifics of its language-independent architecture anddescribing how language-specific data is integrated with gen-eral processing modules.
While this architecture is currentlyoperating for data extraction from Japanese, Spanish, and En-glish texts, it has been designed to be extended to additionallanguages in the future.
Murasaki also has associated mul-tilingual data acquisition tools and algorithms, which havebeen used to extend its data modules.
In addition, we havedeveloped preliminary multilingual training and evaluationtools for the syntax and discourse modules of Murasaki.Planned future enhancements include addition of new datamodules (e.g.
multilingual "WordNets"), extension of theSpanish and Japanese data sources to new domains, andimproved multilingual tools for automatic data acquisitionfrom corpora.
We would also like to extend the system to anew, typologically different language such as Arabic in orderto further test and refine its language independence.Referencesl.
