CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES AND CCG:L INK ING THEORY AND INCORPORATED ARGUMENT ADJUNCTSMichael WhiteDepartment ofComputer and Information ScienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA, USAmwhit e~linc, cis.
npenn, eduAbstractIn Combinatory Categnrial Grammar (CCG) \[Ste90,Ste91\], semantic function-argument structures are com-positionally produced through the course of a deriva-tion.
These structures identify, inter alia, which enti-ties play the same roles in different events for expres-sions involving a wide range of coordinate constructs.This sameness of role (i.e.
~hematie) information isnot identified, however, across eases of verbal diathe-sis.
To handle these cases as well, the present paperdemonstrates how to adapt the solution developed inConceptual Semantics \[Jac90, Jac91\] to fit the CCGparadigm.The essence of the approach is to redefine the Link-ing Theory component of Conceptual Semantics interms of CCG categories, o that derivations yield con-ceptual structures representing the desired thematic in-formation; in this way no changes are required on theCCG side.
While this redefinition is largely straightfor-ward, an interesting problem arises in the case of Cornceptual Semantics' Incorporated Argument Adjuncts.In examining these, the paper shows that they cannotbe treated as adjuncts in the CCG sense without intro-ducing new machinery, nor without compromising theindependence of the two theories.
For this reason, thepaper instead adopts the more traditional approach oftreating them as oblique arguments.1 In t roduct ionTile present paper represents the first attempt tointegrate Mark Steedman's theory of CombinatorialCategorial Grammar (CCG) \[Ste90, Ste91\] with RayJackendoff's theory of Conceptual Semantics \[Jac90,~lac91\].
The former is known for its successhd treat-ment of tong-distance dependencies, coordination, and,more recently, matters of discourse focus relating tointonation---none of which have been treated withinConceptual Semantics.
The latter is known for its de-velopment of conceptual structures, which are mentalrepresentations intended to serve as the link betweenlanguage and other areas of cognition, e.g.
vision, ac-tion and inference--which CCG stops short of.
SinceCCG is a. lexically oriented theory of grammar,  the twoare entirely compatible, as well as complementary.The immediate motivation to attempt such an inte-gration, and the focus of the present paper, is CCG's in-complete treatment of sameness of role (i.e.
thematic)information.
In CCG, semantic function-argumentstructures are compositionally produced through thecourse of a derivation.
These structures identify, in-ter alia, which entities play the same roles in differentevents for expressions involving a wide range of coor-dinate constructs.
For example, the semantic function-argument structure shown in ( lb) is derived for thesentence in ( la) via type-raising, composition, and co-ordination of the bracketed non-standard constituent,following the analysis of Dowty \[Dow88\]: 1( la) Jack filled \[the urn with coffee\] and \[the thermoswith milk\].
(lb) (fill' urn' coffee' jack') & (fill' thermos' mill"jack')Of course, such semantic function-argument structuresare intended only for illustrative purposes; indeed, ac-cording to Steedman, semantic onstants like urn'  are"mere placeholders for a real semantics, intended to dono more than illustrate this compositionality."
Never-theless, we may glean from these structures the require-ment that urn' and thern*os' play the same semanticrole, since they are both first arguments to fill', andlikewise for coffee' and milk', since they are both sec-ond arguments.
In the terminology of Conceptual Se-mantics, these requirements may be restated in termsof thematic roles as follows: urn' and lhermos' sharethe thematic role Goal in their respective vents; like-1The semantic role of determiners and tenne will be ignoredin this paper.ACT~ DE COLING-92., NANI'ES, 23-28 Aofrr 1992 2 4 6 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992wise, coffee' and milk' share tile thematic role Theme.
2Now, while CCG can thus be said to identify thematicinformation across a wide range of expressions not eas-ily analyzed in other theories, it does not do so acrosscases of verbal diathesis (i.e, argument structure alter-nations).
For example, consider (2), together with twopossible sets of interpretations that follow:(2a) Jack filled the urn {with decaf}.
(2b) The urn filled {with decaf}.
(2c) Coffee filled the urn {* with decal}.
(3a) fill' urn' {decaf~ jack'(35) till' {decaf'} urn'(3c) tilt" urn' coffee'(4a) tiU.'
arn' {deck/'} jack'(45) fil lb'{decaf'} urn,'(4c) fill~' urn' coffee'Here it would not do to derive the function-argumentstructures shown in (3), as they incorrectly equate se-mantic roles in some eases, t'br example, the roles ofjack" and coffee" are incorrectly said to be the samefor Jack filled the urn and Coffee filled the urn.
Thisproblem may be avoided by introducing distinct con-stants ill//' (with possibly varying arities), as shown in(4).
Note, however, that this approach is incomplete,insofar as it fails to equate any semantic roles acrossthe functions til~ ', at least in the absence of furtherconditions on these functions.To handle these cases as well, the present paperdemonstrates how to adapt the solution developed inConceptual Semantics to fit tile CCG paradigm.
Thisapproach may be seen as one method of specifying,in a principled fashion, the further conditions on con-stants like filli' necessary to give a complete accountof thematic role identities.
3 It should not be viewed,however, as a variant of purely syntactic approaches toverbal diathesis, such as the Unaccusative tlypothesis\[Bur86\] in GB, which posit movement between an un-derlying and a surface structure and traces to recoverthematic roles)2 This restatetaent is actually acor~iderable atrengtheldngb asCCG is not committed to anything stronger thmt he individualthematic role view (cf.
\[Dow91D; thai is, it requi~s no nmre thanjack' play the "filler" role, urn' and thermos' play the "filled"role, etc.3Another viable approach is of course to use ntemffng postu-lates.

While this redefinition islargely straightforward, an interesting problem arisesill the case of Conceptual Semantics' Incorporated Ar-gument Adjuncts.
In examining these, the paper showsthat they cannot be treated as adjuncts in the CCGsense without introducing new machinery, nor with-out compromising the independence of the two the-ories.
For this reason, the paper instead adopts themore traditionM approach of treating them as obliquearguments.2 Pre l iminar iesThis section reviews the details of CCG mid ConceptualSemmltics needed to understand their integration.2 .1 CCC=,Exan~ple (2) sullices to review the necessary details ofCCG.
A CCG deriw~tion starts with lexical lookup,which identifies the functional type and semantics ofcach constituent.
For example, the category of the verbfill needed for .lack filled the urn is as shown in (5):(5) ~ill := ($ \NP) /NP  : fill_a'In this notation, a category consists of a syntactic ate-gory paired via an infix colon with a semantic function.Syntactic categories have arguments appearing to theright of slashes, results to the left.
The direction of theslash indicates tile direction of tlle argument.
Thus thesyntactic ategory (S\NP)/NP defines a fimction thattakes all NP to tile right and returns a function from anNP on the left to an S. Categories may combine via for-ward or backward functional application, indicated asACTF~S DE COLING-92, Nhrcre.s, 23-28 AO~'r 1992 2 4 7 PROC.

Categories may also combine byother means uch as composition, often yielding multi-ple derivations of the same string.
For present purposesthis is of no significance, as all of the derivations of willproduce the stone compositional meaning.
Derivationsfor the rest of the examples in (2) are quite similar,differing only in the lexically specified category for fill.2.2  Conceptua l  Semant icsExample (2) again suffices to review the necessary de-tails of Conceptual Semantics.
The version of Concep-tual Semantics presented below is that of \[Jac90\] priorto the introduction of Linking Theory, plus a few mod-ifications.
Let us begin with the representation f anurn.
Jackendoff represents an urn as the conceptualstructure shown in (6):(~) \[Thing URN\]This represents an entity of ontological type Thing thatmeets the featural description URN.
5 To distinguishdifferent urns, I will follow Zwarts and Verkuyl \[ZV91\]in requiring all conceptual structures to have an index,as shown in (7a):(7a) \[Thing URN\]j(Tb) Thing(j) & URN(j)Note that under the Zwarts and Verkuyl formalization,(7a) is roughly equivalent to the more familiar (7b).In addition to the ontological type Thing, an entitymay be of type Place, Path, Event, State, Manner orProperty.
The Place in t, he urn, for example, would berepresented as in (8a):(8&) \[Place IN(\[Thins URN\]/)\]p(8b) Place(p) & IN(j,p) & Thing(j) & URN(j)Here we have a conceptual function IN: Thing ~ Placemapping the urn j to the locatiou inside the urn p. Ex-ample (8b) is again an approximate notational variant.Moving on to the stative reading of example (2c),Coffee filled the urn, we introduce the conceptual func-tion BE: Thing x Place - ,  State (note that as in thisexample, ontological categories and indices will often~Sma\]l caps will be used to indicate feature~ that are atomicin Conceptual Structure, serving oldy ~ links to other areas ofcognition.be suppressed for typographical convenience):(9a) \[ BE(\[COFFEE\],, \[IN(\[URN\])\]p) \]State FILL s(9b) State(a) &FILL(g) & BE( i ,p ,s )  & .
.
.Extending \[Jac90\], I have included the conceptual tomFILL in (9a).
As is the case of other categories, thisatom serves as a pointer to semantic information otcaptured by the decomposition.
Thus the state s is tobe understood as one characterized by the atom FILLand by the feature BE(I,p).
Note that the variant in(9b) is reminiscent of the neo-Davidsonian approachadopted by Parsons \[Parg0\].To get the inchoative reading of (2c), we need onlyadd the conceptual function INCH: State -~ Eventshown in (10):I INCH( \[ BE(\[cOFFEE\]' [IN(\[URN\])\])  1 FIL )Event ?
(10)The conceptual structure for example (2b), The urnfilled {with deca~, would differ minimally from (10) byhaving \[DECAF\] as the Theme instead of \[COFFEE\], orby having the Theme left implicit.We are now in a position to construct he con-ceptual structure for example (2a), Jack filled the urn{with decal}, by adding the External Instigator func-tion C(AU)S(E): Thing x Event --* Event and theActor-Patient function AFF(ECT): Thing x Thing ~-*Event:(1 In) FILLAFF(\[JACK\]/, \[URNJj)Event FILL e( l lb)  Event(e) & FILL(e) & AFF( i , j , e )  & .
.
.Here the representation f the inchoative vent servingas the second argument of CS has an implicit Theme k,which the with-PP would specify if present.
Note alsothat the entity \[JACK\]/ serves as both Actor and Exter-nal Instigator, and likewise \[URN\]/ serves as both Pa-tiant mid Goal, by virtue of coindexation.
And again,the variant in (1 lb) indicates the similarity of this ap-proach to the neo-Davidsonian o e.At this point we may observe that representationsin (9) - (11) capture the similarities and differences insemantic roles observed in tile arguments of the verbACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao(rr 1992 2 4 8 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992fi l l in (2).
This follows straightforwardly from the in-clusion of representations (9) mid (10) within (11), to-gether with the semantic oindexation.Next we turn to a brief description of how theserepresentations are constructed in \[Jac90\].
Two repre-sentative lexical entries, that of the stative Jill of (2c)and causative-inchoative f i l l  of (2a), are shown below:l fill \] V__  NPj\[\[ FILLBE(\[Thing \]i, \[IN(\[Thins \]j)\]) \](12)fillV_ _  NPj tpp with NPk\]CS i INCH BE(k,\[IN(j)\]) \]1 L FILL(13)in (12), the verb f i l l  subcategorizes an object NP in-dexed j, as well as an external argument indexed i byconvention.
Sinfilarly, (13) subcategorizes an objectNP and a wi~h-PP.
Arguments to the verb are inte-grated into the above conceptual structure using theArgument Fusion Rule, which links the coindexed con-stituents in the obvious way, as long as they are seman-tically compatible.3 Linking TheoryThis section details how the Linking Theory componentof Conceptual Semantics can be redefined in terms ofCCG categories, so that derivations yield conceptualstructures like (9) - (11).
Before introducing LinkingTheory, however, we shall first examine how tim versionof Conceptual Semantics presented in the last sectioncan he adapted to fit the CCG paradigm.As was suggested in ,Section 1, the present approachmay be seen as specifying constraints on the constants\]Jill ' so that the desired thematic role identities are cap-tured.
This may be done by simply redefining lexicalentries like (12) and (13) as follows:fillVS \NP/NP~ji.
\[ BE~i, tN(j)\]) \](14)fillVS \ NP / PP(with) / NPCS(i, INCI I (BE(k, \ [ IN( j ) \ ] )  ) ) 1AjlS.
AFF(i, j)FILL(15)IIere the subcategorization frmnes have been replacedby the appropriate CCG categories, and the conceptualstructures have been made into the appropriate func-tions corresponding to the filli ' constants.
Because thisinformation is supplied lexically, no changes need bemade on the CCG side.
Thus conceptual structures forsentences like those in (la) and (2) may be easily de-rived with the addition of just a few more lexical itemslike those below: 6Jack \](16) PN NP \[JACK\]with \]Prep(17) I'P(with) / NP~x .xGiven such lexical items, the constants appearing in(lb) and (4) may be replaced yielding fimctions likethe first one appearing in Figure 2, which is equivalentmudulo an appropriate definition of \]?-reduction to tileone appearing; beh)w it.

(19) * The urn dellifed Jack.To capture such generalizations, Jackendoffproposes toeliminate rigid coindexation between syntactic and se-mantic structures, opting to introduce Linking Theoryto handle this task instead.
Lexieal entries are there-fore modified to indicate only which conceptual con-stituents must be specified, and not which syntacticconstituents must specify them.
The selected concep-tual arguments are annotated with an A, or A-marked.In present erms, this means changing entries like (15)to ones like (20): ~'fill, dellifVS \NP/NP(20)Categories like the one in (15) thus become derived in-rThe w/~h-PP is unselected for exp~ititory reasons only.stead of lexically specified, with Linking Theory spec-ifying constraints on such derivations to permit Aji asthe only possible argument ordering.
The central ideabehind such constraints i as follows: Given (indepen-dently motivated) syntactic and semantic hierarchies,do not allow inconsistent orderings.
This is stated moreformally in (21):(21) Linking Principle: A semantic function headedby Aa:l...xn in a CCG category must not haveXi -~sem ~j and ~i ~'~yn x/, or vice-versa, where-~sern and "~sy, encode the semantic and syntactichierarchies, respectively.Note that if Actor "~sem Patient and Subject -%yn Di-rect Object, then the ordering Aij (with indices as be-fore) required for dellif is indeed ruled out by the Link-ing Principle.
sAs developed so far, tile status of the Linking Prin-ciple in the present framework is that of a filter onrepresentations.
The Linking Principle may be mademore constructive by eliminating syntactic specifica-tions from lexical entries, following (say) Rappaportand Levin \[RL88\] or Pinker \[Pin89\], deriving them in-stead via Linking Rules which obey the Linking Prin-ciple.
:\]ackendoff does not rule out this possibility, butchooses to develop instead an approach in which bothsyntactic and semantic subcategorization is retained.I shall part company with Jackendoff on this issue,as I find his arguments in favor of retaining subcate-gorization unconvincing.
These arguments are twofold.First, verbs appear to idiosyncratically specify prepo-sitions.
Such verbs may be accommodated within thepresent framework by simply providing fully specifiedcategories like (15).
Second, and more interestingly,some Incorporated Argument Adjuncts arc syntacti-cally obligatory.
This argument presupposes, of course,a Observe that the syntactic ordering cannot be defined fromthe syntactic type if subjects are to precede complements.ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hOb'T 1992 2 5 0 PROC.

<s\NPSFigure 3: A Derivation Involving the HypotheticalCCG With-Theme Adjunct,the correctness of the Incorporated Argument Adjunctanalysis, to which we now turn.4 Incorporated Argument  Ad-junctsJackendoff observes that with-PPs may specify an op-tional Theme argument across a wide range of verbs.This observation leads him to hypothesize that suchwith-Themes hould not be treated as subcategorizedarguments, bnt rather as adjuncts.
Such au analy-sis is partieulary appealing in cases involving an in-corporated Theme, such as butter, as in Jack but-feted ~he bread with that yacky stuff.
9 We shall see,however, that this analysis cannot be adapted intothe present framework without adding substantial newmachinery, 1?
nor without compromising the indepen-dence of the two theories.
In contrast, the traditionaloblique argument analysis will be seen to surmountthese difficulties in a natural way.Jaekendoff's informal version of the With-ThemeAdjunct Rule is repeated below:(22) With-Theme Adjunct  Rule:  In a sentence con-taining with NP in the VP, if the Theme positionis not indexed in the verb's lexical entry, then theobject of with cazl be interpreted as Theme.With (22) in mind, one might try to redefine (17) asfollows:Prep(23) (S\Nl ')  \ (S \m' )  / NPAyfz.withTheme y ( f  x)Here with is defined as a function from an NP to a VP-nit shtmld be noted that Jackendoif does not adequately ad-dress the issue of why the class of apread~ appropriate for the verbbutter ia larger than the class apppopriate for the ,mue noun.l?As was done in m~ ear|ier vexalon of this paper.modifier, where the constant WithTheme stands in forthe function that fuses the Theme with the specifiedNP.
A sample syntactic derivation using (23) is shownin Figure 3.There are two problems with adequately specify-ing the function withTh~me.
First, one might questionits introduction on theoretical grounds, as it marksa substantial departure from the simple rule (18), /3-reduction as Argument Fusion, compromising the inde-pendence of the two theories.
Second, there is an em-pirical problem of avoiding examples like (2c), * CoSecfilled the urn wi~h decaf .
In (22), Jackendoff stipulatesthat the Thenm position be unindexed in the verb's lex-ical entry.
This argmneut indexing information is nolonger available, however, at the point in the deriva-tion in which the withThcm e constant is to perform itsmagic, since the function ( f  x) is already saturated.Again, while adequate fixes might be possible, any suchapproach would seem quite ad hoc.Instead of treating these wilh-PPs as adjuncts, wemay rehrterpret Jackendoff's (22) as a Linking Rule foroblique with-Theme PP arguments.
This rule wouldthen bc just one of those necessary to derive the cate~gory in (15) from tim lexical entry in (24) below; otherrules would map Actors to Subject NPs, Patients toDirect Object NPs, etc.
Note that in this entry thesubcategorization f the Theme argmnent is indicatedto be optional by tim curly braces:fillV(24)Under this formulation, both of the problen~q men-tioned above disappear: first, the Theme's specifica~tion again becomas like that of any other argument,and second, the ungrammatieality of * Coffee filledthe urn with decal again becomes a straightforwardconsequence of the independently motivated (Neo) 0-Criterion.At this point we may return to Jaekeadoff's ar-gument in favor of retaining syntactic subcategoriza~tion.
After having chosen to treat oblique argumeutsas Incorporated Arguumnt Adjuncts, Jackendoff thenobserves that they are not always optional.
Rathcrthan retreat, however, he suggests that these are casesof syntactic subcategorization not matching semanticsubcategorization.
For example, consider (25):(25) Jack rid the room {* 0 / of insects}.The verb *~d is like empty in taking an of-Theme Pl',AcrEs lJ~ COLlNG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 2 $1 PROC.
or: COLING-92, Na~rr~.s, AUG. 23-28, 1992semantically the inverse of the with-Theme PP.
Unlikeempty, however, the PP is obligatory for r/d.
Thisleads Jackdendoff to posit a lexieal entry like (26), inwhich the Theme is not A-marked but the PP is oblig-atory.
Such lexical entries are then used to argue infavor of retaining syntactic subeategorizatiou.
Thisrather unusual move does not seem to be necessary,however.
~ Consider the representation adopted in thepresent framework, appearing in (27).
This represen-tation adequately captures r/d's idiosyncratic selectionfacts by simply requiring the A-marking of the Theme,forcing the appearance of the with-PP.
Of course, to theextent that the existence of lexical entries like (26) iscalled into question, the argument following from theirexistence becomes likewise suspect.ridV__  NP \[pp of  NP\]\[CS(i,\[INCH(\[NOTBE(k,\[IN(j)\])\])\])IAFF(iA,j A ) R I D(26)ridV\[ RIDAFF(iA'jA)CS(i'\[INCH(\[NOTBE(kA'\[IN(j)\])\])\]) \](27)5 ConclusionThe present paper has suggested that Conceptual Se-mantics and Combinatory Categorial Grammar arecompatible, even complementary theories.
It has ar-gued that (1) Conceptual Semantics need only be min-imally modified to adapt it to tile CCG paradigm, thusproviding CCG with a more complete account of the-matic role identities, and (2) these changes need not af-fect CCG at all if Conceptual Semantics' IncorporatedArgument Adjuncts are treated as oblique arguments.A Prolog implementation of the framework pre-sented herein is currently in progress.
