Finally, the ordering; ot'm>t.ities for showing the degree of salience is &mcril)ed.115 12.1 Zero -PronounsIn Kameyama's account, only one zero-pronounencodes the Cb, and any otl~er zero-pronouns be-come Cfs, just as if they had been overtly ex-pressed in the sentence.
In other words, when thereare multiple zero-pronouns, only one of the zero-pronouns has any significance, and ally other zero-pronoun might as well have been overtly expressed.But, because entities become zero-pronouns in or-der to avoid unnaturalness due to redundancy, zero-pronouns can be said to be salient enough to be un-derstood without being overt.
Iu effect, this meansthat a greater amount of attention is placed on themthan entities that were overtly expressed.
This isshown through an example.Taking her approach, some simple extensions aremade to see how well the ordering of entities in cen-tering would work for multiple zero-pronouns.
First,the antecedent for the Cb-eueoding zero-pronoun ischosen.as hown in \[Kameyama 85\].
Basically, thisconsists of choosing the entity with the highest de-gree of salience in the previous sentence.
Then, thenext most salient zero-pronoun according to the or-dering of degrees of salience given in the previoussection is considered.
The antecedent for this zero-pronoun is the most salient entity fi'om the previ-ous sentence which will not contradict any possibleconstraints.
At this point, we only consider seman-tic constraints for excluding such sentences as "Thedesk ate fish" and contra-index constraints for ex-cluding such sentences as "Jack ate Jack."
Any otherzero-pronouns are handled in tile same manner.
Forexample, the following discourse is examinedl:Example 1:(1) Taro wa Jiro to shokuji chuu de atta.Taro Top/Sub airo with meal during wasTaro was h.avin 9 a meal wilh.
airo.Cb: - - ,  Cf: Taro > .
}ire(2) @ Saburo we mikaketa.Sub Saburo Obj saw(Taw) saw SabTtro.Cb: Taro, Cf: Saburo(3) ~ ?
airo ni shoukaishita.Sub Obj Jiro Obj2 introduced(Taro) introduced (5'aburo) to Jiro.
(4) ?
q' Shokuji ni sasotta.Sub Obj meal Obj2 invited(Taw) invited (Sal, uro) to lhe meal.1 "?5" denotes zero-pronouns, and Top, Sub, Obj, Obj2 de~notes Topic, Subject, Object, and Object2, respectively.In sentence (1), tile Cfs are ordered as Taro > Jiro,since Topic is the most salient entity.
In sentence (2),the entity with the highest degree of salience fi'o,nthe previous sentence (Taro) is chosen as tile zero-pronoun's antecedent, and becomes the Cb, withSaburo becoming a Cf.
In tile third sentence, afterTaro is chosen as the subject of the sentence, sincethere is only Saburo left,, Saburo becomes the an-tecedent of tile object zero-pronoun, assuming thatthere is some sort of knowledge preventing Taro frombecoming the object.After sentence (3), the ordering of noun phraseswould be as follows:Taro (Cb) > Jiro (Cf- Obj2) = Saburo (Cf- Oh j)This means that sentence (4) is ambiguous, havingtile following possible interpretations:(a) Taro invited Jiro to the meal.
(b) Taro invited Saburo to the rneal.But, the preferred meaning is (b).
So, this wouldmean that the ordering should be as follows:Taro > Eaburo > JiroThis example shows that when trying to interpretmore than one zero-pronoun, the ordering of nounphrases according to Kameyama's acconnt may notbe optimal.
Of course, this can be rectified by chang-ing the ordering of the degree of salience so that Ob-ject is higher than Object2, and as noted later in thepaper this will actually take place.
But, suppose sen-tence (3) in Example 2 is replaced with the followingsentence:(3') q5 '-b Jiro we shoukaishita.Sub Obj2 airo Obj introduced(Ta,,)  i,,.t,~od,,ce~ ai,'o (to S,,b,,,'o).Even in this case, the interpretation of sentence(4) would not change 2.
So, the ordering of zero-pronoun not being optimal, i.e.
that zero-pronounsare more likely to become zero-pronouns again thanovert noun phrases, would seeln to be the more log-ical choice.So, we propose that "entities that have becomezero-pronouns are more centered in tile discoursethan those that have been overtly expressed."
There-fore, tile centering model has been extended to tilefollowing two lists to handle entities (noun phrases)that appear in a sentence:~Althougb it should be noted that it doesn't  seem to be ,asstrongly preferred as before.1752(1) Center  L is t  .

Entit ies in a sentence.that  were overtly exl)ressed.2 .2  P ronounsIn Japanese, both overt and elided t)ronondnalforms exist.
The elided l)rOl,Ominal forl'Ll (zero-pronoun) was discussed in the previous subsection.In this subsection, we will show how pronouns arehandled within tile proposed nlodel.ill Kanleyatnlat~s acco/lnt, \])ronollltS do ltot elicodeCbs and can only become C\[~s.
If overt pronounsare treated as entit ies that were overtly expressed(i.e.
put in the Possibh'.
Center I,ist), the \[blk)wingexample will not l)e interpreted correctly a.l'~xanq)le 2:(1) Taro wa Jiro to hatnatshiteitat.Taro ' l 'op/Sub J iro with talking"l'(Iro was lalL"~ng wilh Jiro.CL:.

:eat-ter List, then tile interpretat ion would be 'Tatro likes3iro.'
\[n order to obtain the preferred interpretat ion,the ordering of noun phrases should be as follows:Taro > llauako > .lifo'l'his example shows that pronoul,s are not n(~ccs-sadly at the same level as with other overt nounphrases.
Ill other words, prollouns atre atl.
at.
level ofattent ion higher than 'ordinary'  noun phrases.
Thisis especially true when considering tile fact that pro-llOllIIS are used to preven\[; nnl/aturathless dllc l.o re-dundancy, just as zero-prononiis are used.a'CL' strums for Center 1,ist., alld '|)('1,' stands for PossibleCenter Lisl,.So, we propose that pronouns be interl)reted atthe same level as zero-pronouns as follows:C (mter  L is t  Mode lThe entit ies in a sentence llelong to one oftile tbllowing two lists:(1) Cei l teF  L is t  .
.
.
l';ntities that  have.become zeroq)ronouns or overt l)rc ~notlns.
(2) Poss ib le  Center  L is t  .
.
.
Entit iesthat were overtly expressed but ~trenot in the Center List.Entit ies ill the Center l,ist are more salientthan those in the l)ossihle Center List, withtile exception of '\['opic.The exceptkm will be touched nllon in the next sub-.section.2 .3  Order ing  by  Sa l ienceNext comes the problenl of ordering witl,in theCenter l,ist and the Possible Center List.
in otherwords, the difference in salience between pronouns(zero and ow;rt) and 'ordinary'  noun phrases isshown by the Center List and the Possible Centerlast.
l,'ntities in the Center List are lnore sMientthan those in the Possible Center List.
But, whatabout t, tl<" difference ill salie.nce within each list?In our model, the ordering is as follows:'l'opic > Subject > Object > Object2 > Others> Subject/Ol~ject/Ol~ject2 of subordinate clause> Others ill Sllbordill~Jt;(!
clauseThe tirst line shows tile ordering of grammaticalfunctions of the main verh.
This line is basically thesame as l (ameyama's  ordering, except that  Object isdeemed to be more salient than Object2.
This wasbecause, after making some prelhninary evaluationsof our model, Object was Rmnd to have at slightlyhigher degree of salience than Object2.The following two lines are for ally entit ies thatatpl)car in subordinate (:l~mses.
'\['here doesn't  seemto be at clear cut difference between the Subject, Ob-ject, and Obje.ct2 of subordinatte clauses, so they areIlcmdled at the same level.
The difference betweenthe lnain clause and any sul)ordinate clauses cap-tures the intuition that entit ies in the main chmseare.
more s~dient han those in subordinate ones.There is one exception to the Center List Model.It is tile salience of the Topic in the Possible Center1153List.
As can be surmised from the term itself, tim'Fopie is special in that the sentence contains infor-mation about the entity corresponding to the Topic.In other words, the sentence is usually about the3bpicalized entity.
So, it was placed at.
the samelevel as the Object in the Center List.3 Exper iment  and  Discuss ionAn experiment was done to show the effectivenessof the Center last Model in interpreting pronounsand zero-pronouns.
A total of 160 sentences fromthe following four discourses were used:?
"Ushikata To Yainanba" \[Tsul)ota 75\] (Japanesefolklore - 70 sentences)?
"Madogiwa No Totto-clmn" \[Kuroyanagi 81\](Story--- 51 sentences)?
"Yasei Doubutsu '.I'o Tomoni" (Newspaper col-Hllln)- "Baison" \[Obara 91\] (15 sentences)- "h'ie Wani"\[Obara 92\] (24 sentences)This section will first describe the simple imple-nlentation used in the experiment.
Then, it is eval-uated (Table 1), followed by a eonll,a.rison (Table 2)with Kameyama's method.3 .1  Imp lementat ionThe implementation is kept simple to demonstratethe eft'eel of the Center List.
Semantic onstraints onthe type of entity that a (zero) pronoun may refer to-- for example, the Subject of 'eat'  must be animate-, and contra-index constraints for restricting combi-nations of eoreferring entities within a sentence - forexample, tile Subject and Object of 'eat.'
cannot bethe same entity - are used.
In addMon, a constraintconcerning tire subject and identification 4 of Cbs inadjacent sentences i used \[Kameyama 86\], except itapplies to each entity in the Center List of adjacentsentences as follows:Two zero-pronouns that appear ill the Cell-ter List of adjacent sentences should shareone of the following properties (in descend-ing order of pret?rence): ( l)  id'entiticationand subject, (2) identification only, (3) sub-ject only, (4) non-identification and not>subject.41(ameymna's terminology for l~mpathy \[Kuno 78\].
Itshows the perspective from which an event is described.Of course, tire Center List and the Possible Cen-ter List by themselves will not be able to handle an-tecedents that arc not in the previous sentence.
Inorder to solve this problem, an ad hoc approach wastaken by adding the following two lists:?
Past Center List ...
Entities that have previ-ously been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun,but do not appear in the current sentence.?
Noun List ...
Entities that have never been azero-pronoun or an overt pronoun.In order to avoid combinatorial explosion, the enti-ties that are held in these two lists are limited tothose which appear in the previous three sentences.Each entity in the four lists is assigned a score toshow its degree of salience.
In other words, tbe scoreshows the possibility of beconfing a zero (or overt)pronoun in the next sentence.After morphological nd syntactic analysis, the in-terpretation process is basically carried out as fol-lows:(1) Using the semantic constraints, possible an-tecedents for pronouns and zeroq)ronouns arefound from the Center List, Possible CenterList, Past Center last, and Nolln List.
(2) Combinations of possible antecedents are made.
(3) Contra-index constraints are applied.
(4) Each combination is given a score as follows:(4.l) Compute the sum of the scores that eachpossible antecedent was given.
(4.2) Give bonus scores according to the subjectand identification constraint.
(5) The combination with the highest score is ch{>sell as the combination with the inost probableantecedents.
(6) The Center List, Possible Center List, etc.
areupdated.3.2 Eva luat ionTable 1 shows our results.
Considering tile factthat t, he Center List Model itself handles only pro-not lns ~tnd gero -prono l lns  whose ~tnteeedents arefound one sentence back, it shows promise since avery simple fi'amework is enough to achieve 76% ac-curacy.

Fronl tilecomparison, the Center List Model can be said toorder the possible antecedents more effectively thanKameyama's method.4 Conc lus ionIn this paper, centering was extended to betterinterpret pronoulrs and zero-pronouns.
It, extendedthe centering model to have two lists.
The CenterList holds entities that 'appeared' in the sentence aseither an overt pronoun or a zero-pronoun.
The Pos-sible Center List holds entities that overtly appearedin the sentence, excluding overt pronouns.A very simple implementation showed that 76%of pronouns and zero-pronouns could be interpreted.
'\['he percentage goes up to 81% when consideringonly those whose antecedents are one sentence back.But, as the figures indicate, a more global frame-work, such as one descrihed in \[Grosz 86\], is needed.AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank CSK Corp. forproviding the morphological and syntactic analyzerused in tile implelnentation.References\[Grosz 86\] Grosz, B.
