In Thailanguage, it frequently happens that there is fluctuationin the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun,both from the point of view of the whole speechcommunity and individual speakers.
Basically, there isno exact rule for classifier selection.
As far as we cando in the rule~based approach is to give a default ruleto pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun.Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to thetype of unit classifier because other types ,are open dueto the meaning of representation.
We propose acorpus-based method (Biber,1993; Nagao,1993;Smadja,1993) which generates Noun ClassifierAssociations (NCA) to overcome the problems inclassifier assignment and semantic construction ofnoun phrase.
The NCA is created statistically from alarge corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchyconstraints and frequency of occurrences.Keywords: Thai language, classifier, corpus-basedmethod, Noun Classifier Associations (NCA)1.
IntroductionA classifier has a significant use in Thai language tbrconstruction of noun or verb to express quantity,determination, pronoun, etc.
By far the most commonuse of classifiers, however, is in enumerations, wherethe classifiers follow numerals and precededemonstratives (Noss,1964).
Not all types of classifierhave a relationship with noun or verb as a unitclassifier does.A unit classifier is any classifier which has aspecial relationship with one or more concrete nouns.For example, to enumerate members of the class of/rya/ 'boats', tile unit classifier/lain/ is selected as inthe phrase below:/rya nung lain/boat one <boat>'one boat'.Other than tile unit classifier, there are collectiveclassifier, metric classifier, frequency classifier andverbal classifier.A collective classifier is ,any classifier whichshows general group or set of mass nouns, un a~ ~/nok soong lung/ 'two flocks of bird'.
A metricclassifier is any classifier which occurs inenumerations that modify predicates as well as nouns,vlh l~1~ ,u~/nam saam kaew/ 'three glasses of water'.A frequency classifier is any classifier which is used toexpress the frequency of event that occurs, ~u ~ ~mJ/bin sii roob/ 'fly four rounds'.
A verbal classifier isany classifier which is derived from a verb and usuallyused in construction with mass nouns, n~z~q~a #  ~ 11")11/kradaad haa muan/ 'five rolls of paper'.The unit classifier has a special relationshipwith concrete noun.
The member of this class ofclassifier is closed for each noun.
Most of the unitclassifiers m'e used with a great many concrete nounsof very different meaning, but few are restricted to asingle noun.
Except for the unit classifier, the membersof classifier for a noun or predicate are open.Especially for the metric classifier, the number ofclassifiers for numeral expression of distance, size,weight, container and value is large.The use of classifier in Thai is not limited tothe nunmral expression but is extended to otherexpressions uch as ordinal, determination, relativepronoun, pronoun, etc.
The detail of each classifierphrase is described in the next section.In many existing natural anguage processingsystems, tile list of available classifiers lk3r each nounis attached to a lexicon base.
Rules for classifierselection from the list can somehow provide the556dcfault value but does not guarantee thcappropriateness, tlowever, the problems on classifierphrase construction still remain unsolved.To overcome the problems of usingclassifiers, we propose a method of classifier phraseextracting fl'om a large corpus.
As a result, Noun-Classifier Associations (dcscribcd in Section 3) isstatistically created to define the relationship betweena noun and a classifier in a classifier phrase.
With theli'equency of tile occurrence of a classifier in aclassifier phrase, we can propose the most apl)rot)riateuse of a classilier.
Furthermore, we introduce ahierarchy of semantic class for tile induction of aclassifier class when they are employed to constructwith nouns which belong to the same class of meaning.Section 3 and Section 4 (lescribc the generation and theimlflcmentation f the NCA, respectively.2.

The propose on classifierassignment using the corpus-based method is anotherapproach.
Based on the collocation of noun andclassifier of each pattern shown in Fig.
2.1, we decidedto construct the Noun Classifier Association table (seeSection 3).
A stocMstic method combined with theconcept hierarchy is proposed as a strategy in makingthe NCA table.
The table composes of the informationabout nonn-classifier collocation, statistic occurrencesand the representative classifier for each semantic lassin the concept hierarchy.3.
Extraction of Noun-Classifier Collocation1,1 this section, wc describe tile algorithm used forextraction of Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) froma large corpus.
We used a 40 megabyte Thai coq)uscollected from wu'ious areas to create tile table.
Thealgorithm is as follows:Step 1: Word segmentation.Input: A corpus.Output: The wordosegmented corpus.hi text processing, we often need word boundaryinformation lot several puqmses.
Because Thai has noexplicit raarke, to separate words from one another, wehave to prcprocess the corpus with word segmentationprogram.
We used the program developed bySornlcrthmwanich (1993) with post-editing to correctfault segmcntation.
The program employs heuristicrules of longest malching and least word countincoq)orated with character combining rules for Thaiwords.
Though tile accuracy of the word segmentationdoes not reach 100%, but it is high enough (more than95%) to reduce the post-~iting time.Step 2: Tagging.Input: Output of step 1.Output: The corpus of which each word is tagged witha part of speech and a semantic lass.The word-segmented corpus is then processed with astochastic paWof.-st)eed, tagger.
Each word w togetherwith its part of speech is then used to reUieve thesemantic class of tile word fiom a dictionary.
Theresult yields a data structure of (w,p,s), where pdenotes the pm-t of speech of w and s denotes thesemantic htss of w. For example, the data structure ofthe word fihf~mA hlakrian/'student' is (ffnt~ou, NCMN,person), where NCMN stml(ls for common noun andt)crson rel)rescnts ffntTml in file class of person.Step 3: Producing cnncordances.hq)ut: Output of step 2, a given classifier el.Output: All the fragnlents containing cl.557Expressions1.

3.2 Concept hierarchyInstead of picking up the data sentence by sentence,we extracted a fragment of data arouud the el, becausethere is no explicit marker to indicate sentenceboundaries.
We used the range of -10 to +2 wordsaround the cl in our experiments which appeared tocover most of co-occurrence patterns.Step 4: PaRern naatchingInput: Output of step 3.Output: A list of nouns-classifiers with frequencyintormatiou of co-occurrences.In this step, the tagged corpus is matched with eachpattern of classifier occurrences shown below:No -NCNM-CL (Enumeration)N- -CL- ~/tii/-NCNM (Ordinal expression)N- -CL-DET (Referential expression)N- -DET-CL(Indefinite demonstration expression)N- -CL-VA'IT (Attribute noun phrase)CL-N (Noun modifier)N- -CL-{~/tii/, ~/sung/,  "ht/n,'fi/,.. }(Relative/Interrogative pronoun)where N denotes noun, CL denotes classifier, NCNMdenotes c~u'dinal number, DET denotes determiner,A ,.
.4 VATF denotes attributive verb, ~l/tu/, ~ /sung/ and '\[u/nai/ are specific Thai words, A-B denotes aconsecutive pair of A and 1t, aud A--B denotes apossibly separated pair.
Actually, A--B can be559separated by several arbitrary words but in ourexperiments we considered only possible separationsby a relative pronoun phrase having no more than 5words.
This is to limit the search space of generalcases to a manageable size with some loss ofgenerality.The pattern matching process was carried outone by one with each pattern.
For each pattern of A- -B-C, the matching of B-C pair was simple and wasperformed at first.
Next, the matching of a pair A- -Bwas done by:1. searching for the nearest A from B. Iffound, mark AI.2.
from B within a span of five, searching forthe nearest relative pronoun.
If found, mark pl then goto 3.
Otherwise, match A1.3.
further searching for the nearest A from p 1.If found, mark A2.
If A2 is farther from B than A1,match A2.
Otherwise, match A I.At the end of these steps, we obtained a list ofnouns Ni along with the frequency of w in the corpusfor each matching pattern (see Fig.
3.1 for sampleouqmts).
Each entry is of the form (W_N1, CLN2,Freq) where W denotes a noun, N1 denotes a numberrepresenting semantic class of W, CL denotes theassociated classifier, N2 is a number indicatingwhether CL is a unit or collective classifier (1 for unit,2 for collective) and Freq denotes the frequency of co-occurrence between W and CL.
The semantic lass isshown in Fig.
3.2.Step 5: Determine representative classifierInput: A list of noun-classifier with frequencyinformation of co-occurrence.Output: Representative classifier of each noun andeach semantic lass of nouns.As it can be observed in Fig.
3.1, each nounmay be used with several possible classifiers.
Inlanguage generation process.
However, we have toselect only one of them.
For each noun we select theclassifier with the greatest value of co-occurrencefrequency to be the representative classifier for bothrepresentative unit classifier and representativecollective classifier.
Tile classifier in Fig.
3.1, forexample, will have ~__1 as the representative unitclassifier and have n~ 2 as the representativecollective one for the noun sm~nr~unq'~ 111.
Collectiveclassifiers are used instead of unit classifiers when thenotion of "group' is required.We also find the representative classifier foreach semantic lass of nouns in the same manner.
Foreach semantic lass of nouns (grouped by the semanticclass attached with each noun), the classifier with thegreatest value of co-occurrence frequency is selectedto be the representative.
The classifier is used tohandle the assignment of classifier to noun which doesnot exist in the trained corpus.
For example, therepresentative unit classifiers for each semantic lassextracted by the pattern (N- -NCNM-CL) are shown inFig.
3.3.4.
Classifier ResolutionThe associations as produced in the previous sectionare useful for determining a proper classifier for agiven noun.
For a noun occurring ill the corpus,alternative determination is accomplished in astraightforward manner by using its associatedrepresentative classifier which occurs in the corpusmore frequently than any other classifiers.
In the othercase where the given noun does not exist in tile corpus,the determination is done by using the representativeclassifier of its class in the concept hierarchy.Some examples of classifier determining arelisted below.
(1) and (3) show the case of nounsappearing in the corpus, while (2) and (4) show adifferent scenario.
In (2), the unit classifier of/appem/is obtained by using the representative unit classifier ofits class "fruit' which is ~n_~ /luuld according to Fig.3.3.
Similarly, in (4), the collective classifier of/gangkerd is determined by the representativecollective classifier of its class "animal' which is ~2/fuung\].Semantic lass Unit classifier Collective classifieranimal ~'L 1 ~.~_2human ~u I ~m~2plant ~u_lfruit nnlFig.

Conclusion"File proposed approach is a significantly new method tomanipulate the classifier phrase in Thai language.
Thefact that the expression of some syntactic onstituentsneeds a specific classifier to be constnmted with and theselection of classifier lot each noun or noun phrasedepends on tile traditional use and the senmntic lass.The corpus-based approach is quite suitable fordetecting the traditional use and searching for the mostappropriate one wlmn it does not exist in the corpus yet.Concept hierarchy of noun provides another path forsearching when the NCA does not cover the noun inquestion.In the future, this NCA will be included in thegeneration process of Machine Translation to solve theclassifier assignment, and incoqmrated in the analysisprocess to produce a proper syntactic and semanticstructure.
The classifier will then be a key for patterndisambiguation when it is fixed to one of the patternsillustrated in Fig.
