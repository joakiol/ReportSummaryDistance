This paper providesa language-oriented review of the exist-ing extraction work.
It points out sev-eral language-specific issues related to ex-traction and proposes a strategy for cop-ing with them.
It then describes a hybridextraction system based on a multilingualparser.
Finally, it presents a case-study onthe performance of an association measureacross a number of languages.1 IntroductionCollocations are understood in this paper as ?id-iosyncratic syntagmatic combination of lexicalitems?
(Fontenelle, 1992, 222): heavy rain, lightbreeze, great difficulty, grow steadily, meet re-quirement, reach consensus, pay attention, ask aquestion.
Unlike idioms (kick the bucket, lend ahand, pull someone?s leg), their meaning is fairlytransparent and easy to decode.
Yet, differentlyfrom the regular productions, (big house, culturalactivity, read a book), collocational expressionsare highly idiosyncratic, since the lexical itemsa headword combines with in order to expressa given meaning is contingent upon that word(Mel?c?uk, 2003).This is apparent when comparing a colloca-tion?s equivalents across different languages.
TheEnglish collocation ask a question translates asposer une question in French (lit., ?put a question),and as fare una domanda, hacer una pregunta inItalian and Spanish (lit., to make a question).As it has been pointed out by many researchers(Cruse, 1986; Benson, 1990; McKeown andRadev, 2000), collocations cannot be describedby means of general syntactic and semantic rules.They are arbitrary and unpredictable, and there-fore need to be memorized and used as such.
Theyconstitute the so-called ?semi-finished products?of language (Hausmann, 1985) or the ?islands ofreliability?
(Lewis, 2000) on which the speakersbuild their utterances.2 MotivationThe key importance of collocations in text pro-duction tasks such as machine translation and nat-ural language generation has been stressed manytimes.
It has been equally shown that collocationsare useful in a range of other applications, such asword sense disambiguation (Brown et al, 1991)and parsing (Alshawi and Carter, 1994).The NLP community fully acknowledged theneed for an appropriate treatment of multi-wordexpressions in general (Sag et al, 2002).
Collo-cations are particularly important because of theirprevalence in language, regardless of the domainor genre.
According to Jackendoff (1997, 156)and Mel?c?uk (1998, 24), collocations constitutethe bulk of a language?s lexicon.The last decades have witnessed a considerabledevelopment of collocation extraction techniques,that concern both monolingual and (parallel) mul-tilingual corpora.We can mention here only part of this work:(Berry-Rogghe, 1973; Church et al, 1989;Smadja, 1993; Lin, 1998; Krenn and Evert, 2001)for monolingual extraction, and (Kupiec, 1993;Wu, 1994; Smadja et al, 1996; Kitamura and Mat-40sumoto, 1996; Melamed, 1997) for bilingual ex-traction via alignment.Traditionally, collocation extraction was con-sidered a language-independent task.
Since collo-cations are recurrent, typical lexical combinations,a wide range of statistical methods based on wordco-occurrence frequency have been heavily usedfor detecting them in text corpora.
Among themost often used types of lexical association mea-sures (henceforth AMs) we mention: statisticalhypothesis tests (e.g., binomial, Poisson, Fisher, z-score, chi-squared, t-score, and log-likelihood ra-tio tests), that measure the significance of the asso-ciation between two words based on a contingencytable listing their joint and marginal frequency,and Information-theoretic measures (Mutual In-formation ?
henceforth MI ?
and its variants),that quantity of ?information?
shared by two ran-dom variables.
A detailed review of the statisticalmethods employed in collocation extraction can befound, for instance, in (Evert, 2004).
A compre-hensive list of AMs is given (Pecina, 2005).Very often, in addition to the information on co-occurrence frequency, language-specific informa-tion is also integrated in a collocation extractionsystem (as it will be seen in section 3):- morphological information, in order to countinflected word forms as instances of the samebase form.
For instance, ask questions, asksquestion, asked question are all instances ofthe same word pair, ask - question;- syntactic information, in order to recognize aword pair even if subject to (complex) syntac-tic transformations: ask multiple questions,question asked, questions that one might ask.The language-specific modules thus aim at cop-ing with the problem of morphosyntactic varia-tion, in order to improve the accuracy of frequencyinformation.
This becomes truly important espe-cially for free-word order and for high-inflectionlanguages, for which the token(form)-based fre-quency figures become too skewed due to the highlexical dispersion.
Not only the data scatteringmodify the frequency numbers used by AMs, butit also alters the performance of AMs, if the theprobabilities in the contingency table become verylow.Morphosyntactic information has in fact beenshown to significantly improve the extraction re-sults (Breidt, 1993; Smadja, 1993; Zajac et al,2003).
Morphological tools such as lemmatizersand POS taggers are being commonly used in ex-traction systems; they are employed both for deal-ing with text variation and for validating the can-didate pairs: combinations of function words aretypically ruled out (Justeson and Katz, 1995), asare the ungrammatical combinations in the sys-tems that make use of parsers (Church and Hanks,1990; Smadja, 1993; Basili et al, 1994; Lin, 1998;Goldman et al, 2001; Seretan et al, 2004).Given the motivations for performing alinguistically-informed extraction ?
which werealso put forth, among others, by Church andHanks (1990, 25), Smadja (1993, 151) and Heid(1994) ?
and given the recent development oflinguistic analysis tools, it seems plausible that thelinguistic structure will be more and more takeninto account by collocation extraction systems.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Insection 3 we provide a language-oriented reviewof the existing collocation extraction work.
Thenwe highlight, in section 4, a series of problems thatarise in the transfer of methodology to a new lan-guage, and we propose a strategy for dealing withthem.
Section 5 describes an extraction system,and, finally, section 6 presents a case-study on thecollocations extracted for four languages, illustrat-ing the cross-lingual variation in the performanceof a particular AM.3 Overview of Extraction Work3.1 EnglishAs one might expect, the bulk of the collocationextraction work concerns the English language:(Choueka, 1988; Church et al, 1989; Church andHanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Justeson and Katz,1995; Kjellmer, 1994; Sinclair, 1995; Lin, 1998),among many others1.Choueka?s method (1988) detects n-grams (ad-jacent words) only, by simply computing the co-occurrence frequency.
Justeson and Katz (1995)apply a POS-filter on the pairs they extract.
As in(Kjellmer, 1994), the AM they use is the simplefrequency.Smadja (1993) employs the z-score in conjunc-tion with several heuristics (e.g., the systematicoccurrence of two lexical items at the same dis-tance in text) and extracts predicative collocations,1E.g., (Frantzi et al, 2000; Pearce, 2001; Goldman et al,2001; Zaiu Inkpen and Hirst, 2002; Dias, 2003; Seretan et al,2004; Pecina, 2005), and the list can be continued.41rigid noun phrases and phrasal templates.
He thenuses the a parser in order to validate the results.The parsing is shown to lead to an increase in ac-curacy from 40% to 80%.
(Church et al, 1989) and (Church and Hanks,1990) use POS information and a parser to extractverb-object pairs, which then they rank accordingto the mutual information (MI) measure they in-troduce.Lin?s (1998) is also a hybrid approach that relieson a dependency parser.
The candidates extractedare then ranked with MI.3.2 GermanGerman is the second most investigated language,thanks to the early work of Breidt (1993) and,more recently, to that of Krenn and Evert, such as(Krenn and Evert, 2001; Evert and Krenn, 2001;Evert, 2004) centered on evaluation.Breidt uses MI and t-score and compares theresults accuracy when various parameters vary,such as the window size, presence vs. absenceof lemmatization, corpus size, and presence vs.absence of POS and syntactic information.
Shefocuses on N-V pairs2 and, despite the lack ofsyntactic analysis tools at the time, by simulatingparsing she comes to the conclusion that ?Veryhigh precision rates, which are an indispensablerequirement for lexical acquisition, can only real-istically be envisaged for German with parsed cor-pora?
(Breidt, 1993, 82).Later, Krenn and Evert (2001) used a Germanchunker to extract syntactic pairs such as P-N-V.Their work put the basis of formal and system-atic methods in collocation extraction evaluation.Zinsmeister and Heid (2003; 2004) focused onN-V and A-N-V combinations identified using astochastic parser.
They applied machine learningtechniques in combination to the log-likelihoodmeasure (henceforth LL) for distinguishing trivialcompounds from lexicalized ones.Finally, Wermter and Hahn (2004) identifiedPP-V combinations using a POS tagger and achunker.
They based their method on a linguisticcriterion (that of limited modifiability) and com-pared their results with those obtained using thet-score and LL tests.2The following abbreviations are used in this paper: N -noun, V - verb, A - adjective, Adv - adverb, Det - determiner,Conj - conjunction, P - preposition.3.3 FrenchThanks to the outstanding work of Gross onlexicon-grammar (1984), French is one of themost studied languages in terms of distributionaland transformational potential of words.
Thiswork has been carried out before the computer eraand the advent of corpus linguistics, while auto-matic extraction was later performed, for instance,in (Lafon, 1984; Daille, 1994; Bourigault, 1992;Goldman et al, 2001).Daille (1994) aimed at extracting compoundnouns, defined a priori by means of certain syn-tactic patterns, like N-A, N-N, N-a`-N, N-de-N, NP Det N. She used a lemmatizer and a POS-taggerbefore applying a series of AMs, which she thenevaluated against a domain-specific terminologydictionary and against a gold-standard manuallycreated from the extraction corpus.Similarly, Bourigault (1992) extracted noun-phrases from shallow-parsed text, and Goldman etal.
(2001) extracted syntactic collocations by us-ing a full parser and applying the LL test.3.4 Other LanguagesIn addition to English, German and French, otherlanguages for which notable collocation extractionwork was performed, are ?
as we are aware of ?the following:?
Italian: early extraction work was carried outby Calzolari and Bindi (1990) and employedMI.
It was followed by (Basili et al, 1994),that made use of parsing information;?
Korean: (Shimohata et al, 1997) used an ad-jacency n-gram model, and (Kim et al, 1999)relied on POS-tagging;?
Chinese: (Huang et al, 2005) used POS in-formation, while (Lu et al, 2004) applied ex-traction techniques similar to Xtract system(Smadja, 1993);?
Japanese: (Ikehara et al, 1995) was based onan improved n-gram method.As for multilingual extraction via alignment(where collocations are first detected in one lan-guage and then matched with their translation inanother language), most or the existing work con-cern the English-French language pair, and theHansard corpus of Canadian Parliament proceed-ings.
Wu (1994) signals a number of problems42that non-Indo-European languages pose for theexisting alignment methods based on word- andsentence-length: in Chinese, for instance, most ofthe words are just one or two characters long, andthere are no word delimiters.
This result suggeststhat the portability of existing alignment methodsto new language pairs is questionable.We are not concerned here with extraction viaalignment.
We assume, instead, that multilingualsupport in collocation extraction means the cus-tomization of the extraction procedure for eachlanguage.
This topic will be addressed in the nextsections.4 Multilingualism: Why and How?4.1 Some IssuesAs the previous section showed, many systems ofcollocation extraction rely on the linguistic pre-processing of source corpora in order to supportthe candidate identification process.
Language-specific information, such as the one derived frommorphological and syntactic analysis, was shownto be highly beneficial for extraction.
Moreover,the possibility to apply the association measureson syntactically homogenous material is argued tobenefit extraction, as the performance of associa-tion measures might vary with the syntactic con-figurations because of the differences in distribu-tion (Krenn and Evert, 2001).The lexical distribution is therefore a relevantissue from the perspective of multilingual colloca-tion extraction.
Different languages show differentproportions of lexical categories (N, V, A, Adv,P, etc.)
which are evenly distributed across syn-tactic types3.
Depending on the frequency num-bers, a given AM could be more suited for a spe-cific syntactic configuration in one language, andless suited for the same configuration in another.Ideally, each language should be assigned a suit-able set of AMs to be applied on syntactically-homogenous data.Another issue that is relevant in the multi-lingualism perspective is that of the syntacticconfigurations characterizing collocations.
Sev-eral such relations (e.g., noun-adjectival modifier,predicate-argument) are likely to remain constantthrough languages, i.e., to be judged as colloca-tionally interesting in many languages.
However,3For instance, V-P pairs are more represented in Englishthan in other languages (as phrasal verbs or verb-particle con-structions).other configurations could be language-specific(like P-N-V in German, whose English equiva-lent is V-P-N).
Yet other configurations might haveno counterpart at all in another language (e.g., theFrench P-A pair a` neuf is translated into Englishas a Conj-A pair, as new).Finding all the collocationally-relevant syntac-tic types for a language is therefore another prob-lem that has to be solved in multilingual extrac-tion.
Since a priori defining these types basedon intuition does not ensure the necessary cover-age, an alternative proposal is to induce them fromPOS data and dependency relations, as in (Seretan,2005).The morphoyntactic differences between lan-guages also have to be taken into account.
WithEnglish as the most investigated language, severalhypotheses were put forth in extraction and be-came common place.For instance, using a 5-words window as searchspace for collocation pairs is a usual practice, sincethis span length was shown sufficient to cover ahigh percentage of syntactic co-occurrences in En-glish.
But ?
as suggested by other researchers,e.g., (Goldman et al, 2001) ?, this assumptiondoes not necessary hold for other languages.Similarly, the higher inflection and the highertransformation potential shown by some lan-guages pose additional problems in extraction,which were rather ignored for English.
As Kim etal.
(1999) notice, collocation extraction is particu-larly difficult in free-order languages like Korean,where arguments scramble freely.
Breidt (1993)also pointed out a couple of problems that makesextraction for German more difficult than for En-glish: the strong inflection for verbs, the variableword-order, and the positional ambiguity of the ar-guments.
She shows that even distinguishing sub-jects from objects is very difficult without parsing.4.2 A Strategy for Multilingual ExtractionSumming up the previous discussion, the cus-tomization of collocation extraction for a givenlanguage needs to take into account:- the syntactic configurations characterizingcollocations,- the lexical distribution over syntactic config-urations,- the adequacy of AMs to these configurations.43These are language-specific parameters whichneed to be set in a successful multilingual extrac-tion procedure.
Truly multilingual systems havenot been developed yet, but we suggest the fol-lowing strategy for building such a system:A. parse the source corpus, extract all the syn-tactic pairs (e.g., head-modifier, predicate-argument) and rank them with a given AM,B.
analyze the results and find the syntactic con-figurations characterizing collocations,C.
evaluate the adequacy of AMs for ranking col-locations in each syntactic configuration, andfind the most convenient mapping configura-tions - AMs.Once customized for a language, the extractionprocedure involves:Stage 1. parsing the source corpus for extract-ing the lexical pairs in the relevant,language-specific syntactic configura-tions found in step B;Stage 2. ranking the pairs from each syntacticclass with the AM assigned in step C.5 A Multilingual Collocation ExtractorBased on ParsingEver since the collocation was brought to the at-tention of linguists in the framework of contextu-alism (Firth, 1957; Firth, 1968), it has been pre-ponderantly seen as a pure statistical phenomenonof lexical association.
In fact, according to a well-known definition, ?a collocation is an arbitrary andrecurrent word combination?
(Benson, 1990).This approach was at the basis of the computa-tional work on collocation, although there exist analternative approach ?
the linguistic, or lexico-graphic one ?
that imposes a restricted view oncollocation, which is seen first of all as an expres-sion of language.The existing extraction work (section 3) showsthat there is a growing interest in adopting themore restricted (linguistic) view.
As mentioned insection 3, the importance of parsing for extractionwas confirmed by several evaluation experiments.With the recent development in the field of linguis-tic analysis, hybrid extraction systems (i.e., sys-tems relying on syntactical analysis for colloca-tion extraction) are likely to become the rule ratherthan the exception.Our system (Goldman et al, 2001; Seretan andWehrli, 2006) is ?
to our knowledge ?
the firstto perform the full syntactic analysis as support forcollocation extraction; similar approaches rely ondependency parsers or on chunking.It is based on a symbolic parser that was de-veloped over the last decade (Wehrli, 2004) andachieves a high level of performance, in terms ofaccuracy, speed and robustness.
The languages itsupports are, for the time being, French, English,Italian, Spanish and German.
A few other lan-guages are being also implemented in the frame-work of a multilingualism project.Provided that collocation extraction can be seenas a two-stage process (where, in stage 1, collo-cation candidates are identified in the text corpora,and in stage 2, they are ranked according to a givenAM, cf.
section 4.2), the role of the parser is tosupport the first stage.
A pair of lexical items isselected as a candidate only if there exist a syntac-tic relation holding between the two items.Unlike the traditional, window-based methods,candidate selection is based on syntactic proxim-ity (as opposed to textual proximity).
Anotherpeculiarity of our system is that candidate pairsare identified as the parsing goes on; in other ap-proaches, they are extracted by post-processingthe output of syntactic tools.The candidate pairs identified are classified intosyntactically homogenous sets, according to thesyntactic relations holding between the two items.Only certain predefined syntactic relations arekept, that were judged as collocationally rele-vant after multiple experiments of extraction anddata analysis (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-object,subject-verb, noun-noun, verb-preposition-noun).The sets obtained are then ranked using the log-likelihood ratios test (Dunning, 1993).More details about the system and its perfor-mance can be found in (Seretan and Wehrli, 2006).The following examples (taken from the extractionexperiment we will describe below) illustrate itspotential to detect collocation candidates, even ifthese are subject to complex syntactic transforma-tions:1.a) atteindre objectif (Fr): Les objec-tifs fixe?s a` l?e?chelle internationalevisant a` re?duire les e?missions nepeuvent pas e?tre atteints a` l?aide deces seuls programmes.1.b) accogliere emendamento (It):44Posso pertanto accogliere in partee in linea di principio gli emenda-menti nn.

The validated collocations are used forpopulating the lexicon of the parser and that of atranslation system (Wehrli, 2003).6 A Cross-Lingual ExtractionExperimentA collocation extraction experiment concern-ing four different languages (English, Spanish,French, Italian) has been conducted on a parallelsubcorpus of 42 files from the European Parlia-ment proceedings.

(4.77), and V-O (3.57).
These distributional differ-ences might account for the types of collocationshighlighted by a particular AM (such as LL) in alanguage vs. another.
Figure 1 displays the rela-tive proportions of 3 syntactic types ?
adjective-noun, subject-verb and verb-object ?
that can befound at different levels in the significance list re-turned by LL.Figure 1: Cross-lingual proportions of A-N, S-Vand V-O pairs at different levels in the significancelistsWe performed a contrastive analysis of results,by carrying out a case-study aimed at checkingthe LL performance variability across languages.The study concerned the verb-object collocationshaving the noun policy as the direct object.
Wespecifically focused on the best-scored collocationextracted from the French corpus, namely menerune politique (lit., conduct a policy).We looked at the translation equivalents of its74 instances identified by our extraction systemin the corpus.
The analysis revealed that ?
atleast in this particular case ?
the verbal collo-cates of this noun are highly scattered: pursue,implement, conduct, adopt, apply, develop, have,draft, launch, run, carry out for English; prac-ticar, llevar a cabo, desarrollar, realizar, aplicar,seguir, hacer, adoptar, ejercer for Spanish; con-durre, attuare, portare avanti, perseguire, pratti-care, adottare, fare for Italian (among several oth-ers).
Some of the collocates (those listed first) aremore prominently used.
But generally they arehighly dispersed, and this might indicate a biggerdifficulty for LL to pinpoint the best collocate in alanguage vs. another.We also observed that quite frequently (in about25% of the cases) the collocation did not conserveits syntactic configuration.
Either the verb ?
here,45the equivalent for the French mener ?
is omittedin translations (like in 2.b below):2.a) des contradictions existent dans lapolitique qui est mene?e (Fr);2.b) we are dealing with contradictorypolicy (En),or, in a few other cases, the whole collocationdisappears, since paraphrased with a completelydifferent syntactic construction:3.a) direction qui a mene?
une politiqueinsense?e de re?duction de personnel(Fr);3.b) a management that foolishly en-gaged in staff reductions (En).In order to quantify the impact such factors haveon the performance of the AM considered, wefurther scrutinized the collocates list for politiqueproposed by LL test for each language (see Table2).
The rank of a pair in the whole list of verb-object collocations extracted, as assigned by theLL test, is shown in the last column.
In these sig-nificance lists, the collocations with politique as anobject constitute a small fraction, and from these,only the top collocations are displayed in Table 2.The threshold was manually defined in accordancewith our intuition that the lower-scored pairs ob-served manifest less a collocational strength.
Ithappens to be situated around the LL value of 20for each language (and is of course specific to thesize of our corpus and to the number of V-O tokensidentified therein).If we consider the LL rank as the success mea-sure for collocate detection, we can infer that thecollocates of the word under investigation are eas-ier to found in French, as compared to English,Italian or Spanish, because the value in the firstrow of the last column is smaller.
This holds if weare interested in only one (the most salient) collo-cate for a word.If we measure the success of retrieving all thecollocates (by considering, for instance, the speedto access them in the results list ?
the higher therank, the better), then French can be again consid-ered the easiest because overall, the positions inthe V-O list are higher (i.e., the mean of the rankcolumn is smaller) with respect to Spanish, Italianand, respectively, English.This latter result corresponds, approximately,to the order given by relative proportion of V-OLanguage collocate freq LL score rankFrench mener 74 376.8 45politique e?laborer 17 50.1 734adapter 5 48.3 780axer 8 41.4 955pratiquer 9 39.7 1011de?velopper 13 28.1 1599adapter 8 25.2 1867poursuivre 11 24.4 1943English pursue 39 214.9 122policy implement 38 108.7 325develop 30 81.1 473conduct 8 28.9 2014harmonize 9 28.2 2090gear 5 27.7 2201need 25 24.9 2615apply 16 23.3 2930Spanish practicar 17 98.7 246pol?

different researchers cited in sec-tion 3): highly inflected languages need lemma-tizers, free-word order languages need structuralinformation in order to guarantee acceptable re-sults.
As language tools become nowadays moreand more available, we expect the collocation ex-traction (and terminology acquisition in general)to be exclusively performed in the future by re-lying on linguistic analysis.
We therefore believethat multilingualism is a true concern for colloca-tion extraction.The paper reviewed the extraction work in alanguage-oriented fashion, while mentioning thetype of linguistic preprocessing performed when-ever it was the case, as well as the language-specific issues identified by the authors.
It thenproposed a strategy for implementing a multilin-gual extraction procedure that takes into accountthe language-specific issues identified.An extraction system for four different lan-guages, based on full parsing, was then described.Finally, an experiment was carried out as a casestudy, which pointed out several factors that mightdetermine a particular AM to perform differentlyacross languages.
The experiment suggested thatlog-likelihood ratios test might highlight certainverb-object collocations easier in French than inSpanish, Italian and English (in terms of saliencein the significance list).Future work needs to extend the type of cross-linguistic analysis initiated here, in order to pro-vide more insights on the differences expected atextraction between one language and another andon the responsible factors, and, accordingly, to de-fines strategies to deal with them.AcknowledgementsThe research described in this paper has been sup-ported in part by a grant from the Swiss NationalFoundation (No.
