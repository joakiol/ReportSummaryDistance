The Jachine realization of the periphrasing systemand the results of the experiment.E.G.
Arsentyeva (Moscow)The paper is devoted to the machine realization of theperiphrasing system devised by I.A.
Mel'chuk and A.K.
GeolcovskyAccording to the idea of the semantic nature of a synthesis adeep sentence structure is used am input data for the periphra-sing sjstem.
By the given rules which are mashing up as a matterof fact the periphrasing ~ystem the other sentence deep struc-tures are obtained from the given deep structure, being equiva-lent by meaning.
Both the machine realization of the periphrasin~ystem and the experiment carried out wre~ intended to verifyand to check out both the periphrasing system and the realizati-on programs.
Further the specified versinn of the periphrasingsystem is supposed to be included in a general system of a Russian semantic synthesis used for the machine translation.The notions used in the periphrasing system are shortlydescribed.
The detailed description of the semantic and syntac-ti~ rules is given.
A paragrapher is devoted the detailed description of the machine dictionary ( s. the paper of I.A?Mel'chukand J. D. Apresyan).
The algorithm periphrasing is given.The work of the algorithm is illustrated by some examples.
