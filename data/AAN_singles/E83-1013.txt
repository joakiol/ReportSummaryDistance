DEALING WITH CONJUNCTIONSIN A MACHINE TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENTXiuming HuangInstitute of Linguisticschinese Academy of Social SciencesBeijing, China*ABSTRACTA set of rules, named CSDC (Conjunct ScopeDetermination Constraints), is suggested forattacking the conjunct scope problem, the majorissue in the automatic processing of conjunctionswhich has been raising great difficulty for natu-ral language processing systems.
Grammars embody-ing the CSDC are incorporated into an existing A~{parser, and are tested successfully against a widegroup of "and" conjunctive sentences, which are ofthree types, namely clausal coordination, phrasalcoordination, and gapping.
With phrasal coordina-tion the structure with two NPs coordinated by"and" has been given most attention.It is hoped that an ATN parser capable ofdealing with a large variety of conjunctions in anefficient way will finally emerge from the presentwork.0 INTRODUCTIONOne of the most complicated phenomena inEnglish is conjunction constructions.
Even quitesimple noun phrases like(i) Cats with whiskers and tailsare structurally ambiguous and would cause problemwhen translated from English to, sa~-, Chinese.Since in Chinese all the modifiers of the nounshould go before it, two different translations inChinese might be got from the above phrase:(la) (With whiskers and tails) de (cats) ("de" isa particle which connects the modifiers andthe modifieds);(ib) ((With whiskers) de (cats)) and (tails).Needless to say, a machine translation systemshould be able to analyse correctly among etherthings the conjunction constructions before highquality translation can be achieved.As is well known, ATN (Augmented TransitionNetwork) grammars are powerful in natural language* Mailing address:Cognitive Studies CentreUniversity of EssexColchester COb 3SQ, England.parsing and have been widely applied in variousNL processing systems.
However, the standard ATNgrsamars are rather weak in dealing with con-junctions.In (Woods 73), a special facility SYSCONJ forprocessing conjunctions was designed and imple-mented in the LUNAR speech question-answering sys-tem.
It is capable of analysing reduced conjunc-tions impressively (eg, "John drove his carthrough and completely demolished a plate glasswindow"), but it has two drawbacks: first, for theprocessing of general types of conjunction con-structions, it is too costly and too inefficient;secondly, the method itself is highly non-deter-ministic and easily results in combinatorial ex-plosions.In (Blackwell 81), a WRD AND arc was propos-ed.
The arc would take the interpreter from thefinal to the initial state of a computation, thenanalyse the second argument of a coordinated con-struction on a second pass through the ATN net-work.
With this method she can deal with somerather complicated conjunction constructions, butin fact a WRD AND arc could have been added tonearly every state of the network, thus making thegrammar extremely bulky.
Furthermore, her syste~lacks the power for resolving the ambiguities con-tained in structures like (1).In the machine translation system designed by(Nagao et al82), when dealing with conjunctions,only the nearest two items of the same parts ofspeech were processed, while the following typesof coordinated conjunctions were not analysedcorrectly:(noun + prep + noun) + and + (noun + prep + noun);(adj + noun) + and + noun.
(Boguraev in press) suggested that a demonshould be created which would be woken up when"and" is encountered.
The demon will suspend thenormal processing, inspect the current context(the local registers which hold constituents re-cognised at this level) and recent history, anduse the information thus gained to construct a newATN arc dynamically which seeks to recognise aconstituent categorially similar to the one justcompleted or being currently processed.
Obviouslythe demon is based on expectations, but what fol-lows the "and" is extremely uncertain so that itwould be very difficult for the demon to reach ahigh efficiency.
A kind of "data-driven" alter-81native which may reduce the non-determinism is totry to decide the scope of the left conjunct re-trospectively by recognising first the type ofthe right conjunct, rather than to predict thelatter by knowing the category of the constituentto the left of the coordinator which is "just com-pleted or being currently processed" -- an obscureor even misleading specification.the ball.Exl3.

The man kicked and the woman threw theball.I CASSEX PACKAGECASSEX (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences;U-niversity of Essex) is an ATN parser based on partof the programs developed by Boguraev (1979) whichwas designed for the automatic resolution of ling-uistic ambiguities.
Conjunctions, one major sour-ce of linguistic ambiguities, however, were nottaken into consideration there because, as the au-thor put it himself, "they were felt to be toolarge a problem to be tackled along with all theothers" (Boguraev 79, 1.6).A new set of grammars has been written, and alot of modifications has been made to the grammarinterpreter, so that conjunctions could be dealtwith within the ATN framework.II PARSING MATERIALSThe following are the example sentencesrectly parsed by the package:Exl.
The man with the telescope and thebrella kicked the ball.Ex2.Ex3.Ex~.Ex5.Ex6.ExT.Ex8.Ex9.ExlO.ExlI.ExI2.cor-urn-The man with the telescope and the um-brella with a handle kicked the ball.The man with the telescope and the wo-man kicked the ball.The man with the telescope and the wo-man with the umbrella kicked the ball.The man with the child and the womankicked the ball.The man with the child and the womanwith the umbrella kicked the ball.The man with the child and the womanis kicking the ball.The man with the child and the womanare kicking the ball.The man with the child and the umbrellafell.The man kicked the ball and the childthrew the ball.The man kicked the ball and the child.The man kicked the child and the womanIII ELEMENTARY NP AND EXPANDED NPThe term 'elementary NP' is used to indicatea noun phrase which can be embedded in but has noother noun phrases embedded in it.
A noun phrasewhich contains other, embedded, NPs is called 'ex-panded Np,.
Thus, when analysing the sentencefr84~ment "the man with the telescope and the womanwith the umbrella", we will have four elementaryNPs ("the man", "the telescope", "the woman" and"the umbrella") and two expanded NPs ("the manwith the telescope" and "the woman with the umbre-lla").
We may well have a third kind of NP, thecoordinated NP with conjunction in it, but it isthe result of, rather than the material for, con-junction processing, and therefore will not recei-ve particular attention.
In the text followed wewill use 'EL-NP' and 'EXP-NP' to represent the twotypes of noun phrases, respectively.LEFT-PART will stand for the whole fragmentto the left of the coordinator;andRIGHT-PART forthe fragment to the right of it.
LEFT-WORD andRIGHT-WORD will indicate the word immediately pre-cedes and follows, respectively, the coordinator.The conjunct to the right of the coordinator willbe called RIGHT-PHRASE.VI CSDC RULESConstraints for determining the grammatical-ness of constructions involving coordinating con-junctions have been suggested by linguists, amongwhich are (Ross 67)'s CSC (Coordinate StructureConstraint), (Schachter 77)'s CCC (Coordinate Con-stituent Constraint), (Williams 78)'s Across-the-Board (ATB) Convention, and (Gazdar @l)'s nontrans-formational treatment of coordinate structures u-sing the conception of 'derived categories'.
Theseconstraints are useful in the investigation of co-ordination phenomena,but in order to process coor-dinating structures automatically, some constraintdefined from the procedural point of view is stillrequired.The following ordered rules, named CSDC (Con-juncts Scope Determination Constraints), are sug-gested and embodied in the CASSEX package so as tomeet the need for automatically deciding the scopeof the conjuncts:i. Syntactical constraint.The syntactical constraint has two parts:82i.i The conjuncts should be of the same syn-tactical category;1.2 The coordinated constituent should be inconformity syntactically with the other constitu-ents of the sentence, eg if the coordinated con-stituent is the subject, it should agree with thefinite verb in terms of person and number.Acoording to this constraint, Ex8 should beanalysed as follows (the representation is a treediagram with 'CLAUSE' as the root and centred a-round the verb, with various case nodes indicatingthe dependency relationships between the verb andthe other constituents):( CLAUSE(TYPE DCL)(QUERY NIL)(TNS PRESENT)(ASPECT PHOGRESSIVE)( MODALITY NIL)(NEG NIL)(v (KICK ((*ANI SUBJ)( (*PHYSOB OBJE)( (THIS (MAN PART) ) INST) STRIK) )*(OBJECT ((BALL1 ,..))(NLg~ER SINGLE)(QUANTIFIER SG)(DETERMINER ((DETI ONE) ) )( AGENTAND((MAN ...)(NUMBER SINGLE)(QUANTIFIER SG)(DETERMINER ((DETIONE)) )(ATTRIBUTE ((PREP (PREP WITH))( (CHILD .
.
.
)(NUMBER ... )((woMAN ... )while Ex7 (and the more general case of ExS) shouldbe analysed roughly as:(AGENT(tMAN ...)(NUMBER SINGLE)(QU~ITIFIER SG)(DETERMINER ((DETI ONE)))(ATTRIBUTE ((PREP (PREP WITH))AND((CHILD ...)(NUMBER ...) ...)( (wo~ ...)2.
Semantic constraint.NPs whose head noun semantic nrimitives arethe same should be preferred when deciding the sco-pe of the two conjuncts coordinated by "and".
How-ever, if no such NPs can be found, NPs with dif-ferent head noun semantic primitives are coordina-ted anyhow.Cf (Wilks 75).According to rule 2, Exl should be roughlyrepresented as 'The man with (AND (telescope) (um-brella))'; Ex2, 'The man with (AND (telescope)(umbrella with a handle))'; Ex3, '(AND (man withtelescope) (woman))' and Exh, '(AND (man with te-lescope) (woman with umbrella))'3.
Symmetry constraint.When rules i and 2 are not enough for deci-ding the scope of the conjuncts, as for Ex5 andEx6, this rule of preferring conjuncts with symme-trical pre-modifiers and/or post-modifiers will bein effect:Ex5 .. .
.
with (AND (child) (woman)) ...Ex6.
(AND (the man with ...) (the woman with...))...h. Closeness constraint.If all the three rules above cannot help, theNP to the left of "and" which is closest to the co-ordinator should be coordinated with the NP imme-diately following the coordinator:Ex9.
The man with (AND (child) (umbrella))fell.V THE IMPLEMENTATIONThe seemingly straightforward way for deal-ing with conjunctions using the ATN grammars wouldbe to add extra WRD AND arcs to the existing sta-tes, as (Black-well 81) proposed.
The problem withthis method is that, as (Boguraev in press) point-ed out, "generally speaking, one will need WRD ANDarcs to take the ATN interpreter from just aboutevery state in the network back toalmosteach pre-ceding state on the same level, thus introducinglarge overheads in terms of additional arcs andcomplicated tests.
"Instead of adding extra WRD AND arcs to theexisting states in a standard ATN gra~,nar, I setup a whole set of states to describe coordinationphenomena.
The first few states in the set are asfollows:(CONJ/ At the moment only((JUMP AND/) "and" is taken into(EQ (GETR CONJUNCTION)consideration.

)The CONJ/ states can be seen as a subgrammrwhich is separated from the main (conventional) ATNgrezmar, and is connected with the main grammar viathe interpreter.The parser works in the following way.Before a conjunction is encountered, the par-ser works normally except that two extra stacks areset: **NP-STACK and **PREP-STACK.
Each NP, eitherEL-NP or EXP-NP, is pushed into **NP-STACK,togetherwith a label indicating whether the NP in questionis a subject (SUBJ) or an object (OBJ) or a prepo-sition object (NP-IN-NMODS).The interpreter takes responsibility of look-ing ahead one word to see whether the word to comeis a conjunction.
This happens when the interpret-er is processing "word-consuming" arcs, ie CAT,WRD, MEM and TST arcs.
Hence no need for expli-citly writing into the grammar WRD AND arcs at all.By the time a conjunction is met, while theinterpreter is ready to enter the CONJ/ state, ei-ther a clause (ExlO-13) or a noun phrase in subjectposition (Exl-9) would have been POPed, or a verb(Exlh-15) would have been found.
For the first ca-se, a flag LEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE will be set to true,and the interpreter will t~j to parse RIGHT-PART asa clause.
If it succeeds, the representation of asentence consisted of two coordinated clauses willbe outputted.
If it fails, a flag RIGHT-PART-IS-NOT-CLAUSE is set up, and the sentence will be re-parsed.
This time the left-part will not be treat-ed as a clause, and a coordinated NP object willbe looked for instead.
ExlO and Exll are examplesof coordinated clauses and coordinated NP object,respectively.
One case is treated specially: whenLEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE is true and RIGHT-WORD is averb (Exl3), the subject will be copied from theleft clause so that a right clause could be built.For the second case, a coordinated NP subjectwill be looked for.
Eg, for Exh, by the time "and"is met, an I~P "the man with the telescope" wouldhave been POPed, and the state of affairs or the**NP-STACK would be like this:(((MAN ...) (NUMBER ...) (QUANTIFIER ...)(DE-TERMINER ,.. ) (ATTRIBUTE ( (PREP (PREP WITH) ) ( (TE-LESCOPE ... ) ) ) SUBJ) ( (TELESCOPE ... )NP-IN-NMODS) )After the excution of the arc ((PUSH NP) (NP-START)), RIGHT-PHRASE has been found.
If it hasan PP modifier, a register NMODS-CONJ will be setto the value of the modifier.
Now the NPs in the**NP-STACK will be POPed one by one to be comparedwith the right phrase semantically.
The NP whoseformula head (the head of the NOUN in it) is thesame as that of the right conjunct will be takenas the proper left conjunct.
If the NP matched isa subject or object, then a coordinative NP sub-ject or object will be outputted; if it is an EL-NP in a PP modifier, then a function REBUILD-SUBJor REBUILD-OBJ, depending on whether the modifiedEXP-NP is the subject or the object, will be call-ed to re-build the EXP-NP whose PP modifier shouldconsist of a preposition and two coordinated NPs.Here one problem arises: for Ex5, the firstNP to be compared with the right phrase ("the wo-man") would be "the man with the child" whose headnoun "~usn" would be matched to "woman" but, accor-ding to our Symmetry Constraint, it is "child"that should be matched.
In order to implement thisrule, whenever NMODS-CONJ is empty (meaning thatthe right NP has no post-modifier), the **NP-STACKshould be reversed so that the first NP to be tri-ed would be the one nearest to the coordinator (inthis case "the child").For the third case (LEFT-WORD is a transitiveverb and the object slot is empty, Exs lh and 15),right clause will be built first, with or withoutcopying the subject from LEFT-PART depending onwhether a subject can be found in RIGHT-PART.Then,the left clause will be completed by copying theobject from the right clause, and finally a clau-sal coordination representation will be returned.In the course of parsing, whenever a finiteverb is met, the NPs at the same level as the verband havin~ been PUSHed into the **NP-STACK shouldbe deleted from it so that when constructing p(s-sible coordinative NP object, the NPs in the sub-ject position would not confuse the matching.
Exllis thus correctly analysed.849-I DISCUSSIONThe package is written in RUTGERS-UCI LISP andis implemented on the PDP-IO computer at the Uni-versity of Essex.
It performs satisfactorily.
How-ever, there is still much work to be done.
For ins-tance, the most efficient way for treating reducedconjunctions is to be found.
Another problem isthe scope of the pre-modifiers and post-modifiersin coordinate constructions, for the resolution ofwhich the Symmetry constraint may prove inadiquate(eg, it cannot discriminate "American history andliterature" and "American histolv and physics").It is hoped that an ATN parser capable of de-sling with a large variety of coordinated construc-tions in an efficient way will finally emerge fromthe present work.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Prof. Wilks of the De-partment of Language and Linguistics of the Uni-versity of Essex for his advice and his patiencein reading this paper and discussing it with me.Any errors in the paper are mine, of course.
Iwould also like to thank Dr. Boguraev and my col-league Fass for part of their parsing programs.REFERENCESBlackwell, S.A. "Processing Conjunctions in an ATNParser".
