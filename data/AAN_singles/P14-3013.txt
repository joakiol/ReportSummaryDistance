Proceedings of the ACL 2014 Student Research Workshop, pages 94?99,Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 22-27 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsSemi-Automatic Development of KurdNet, The Kurdish WordNetPurya AliabadiSRBIAUSanandaj, Iranpuryait@gmail.comAbstractRecently, we reported on our efforts tobuild the first prototype of KurdNet.
Inthis proposal, we highlight the shortcom-ings of the current prototype and put for-ward a detailed plan to transform this pro-totype to a full-fledged lexical database forthe Kurdish language.1 IntroductionWordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in nu-merous natural language processing tasks such asword sense disambiguation and information ex-traction with considerable success.
Motivated bythis success, many projects have been undertakento build similar lexical databases for other lan-guages.
Among the large-scale projects are Eu-roWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis etal., 2004) for European languages and IndoWord-Net (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages.Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family oflanguages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geo-graphical region spanning the intersections of Iran,Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1).Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which,among other resources, no wordnet has been builtyet.Despite having a large number (20 to 30 mil-lions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012;Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among theless-resourced languages for which the only lin-guistic resource available on the Web is rawtext (Walther and Sagot, 2010).
In order to ad-dress this resource-scarceness problem, the Kur-dish language processing project (KLPP1) hasbeen recently launched at University of Kurdis-tan.
Among the the major linguistic resources thatKLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a1http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htmIranTurkeySyria IraqAr.Figure 1: Geographical Distribution of KurdishSpeakersWordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish lan-guage.
Earlier this year, we reported (Aliabadiet al., 2014) on our effort to build the first pro-totype of KurdNet.
In this paper, we propose aplan to transform this preliminary version into afull-fledged and functional lexical database.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.We first (in Section 2) give a brief overview of thecurrent state of KurdNet.
Then after highlightingthe main shortcomings of the current prototype inSection 3, we present our plan to transform thisprototype to a full-blown lexical database for theKurdish language in Section 4.
We conclude thepaper in Section 5.2 KurdNet: State-of-the-ArtIn our previous work (Aliabadi et al., 2014), wedescribed the steps that we have taken to build thefirst prototype of KurdNet.
There, we1.
highlighted the main challenges in buildinga wordnet for the Kurdish language (includ-ing its inherent diversity and morphologicalcomplexity),2. built the first prototype of KurdNet, the Kur-dish WordNet (see a summary below), and943.
conducted a set of experiments to evaluate theimpact of KurdNet on Kurdish informationretrieval.In the following, we first define the scope of ourfirst prototype, then after justifying our choice ofconstruction model, we describe KurdNet?s indi-vidual elements.2.1 ScopeKurdish has two main dialects (Esmaili andSalavati, 2013): Sorani and Kurmanji.
In the firstprototype of KurdNet we focus only on the So-rani dialect.
This is mainly due to lack of an avail-able and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary.Moreover, processing Sorani is in general morechallenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a).2.2 MethodologyThere are two well-known models for buildingwordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998):?
Expand: in this model, the synsets are builtin correspondence with the WordNet synsetsand the semantic relations are directly im-ported.
It has been used for Italian in Mul-tiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet.?
Merge: in this model, the synsets and rela-tions are first built independently and thenthey are aligned with WordNet?s.
It has beenthe dominant model in building BalkaNet andEuroWordNet.The expand model seems less complex andguarantees the highest degree of compatibilityacross different wordnets.
But it also has potentialdrawbacks.
The most serious risk is that of forcingan excessive dependency on the lexical and con-ceptual structure of one of the languages involved,as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996).In our project, we follow the Expand model,since it can be partly automated and thereforewould be faster.
More precisely, we aim at cre-ating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the BaseConcepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of5,000 essential concepts (i.e.
synsets) that playa major role in the wordnets.
Base Concepts(BC) is available on the Global WordNet Associa-tion (GWA)?s Web page2.
The Entity-Relationship(ER) model for the data represented in Base Con-cept is shown in Figure 2.

structural prop-erties, including: synsets and the lexical relationsamong them, POS, Domain, BCS, and SUMO.KurdNet?s language-specific aspects, on the otherhand, have been built using a semi-automaticapproach.
Below, we elaborate on the details ofconstruction the remaining three elements.Synset Alignments: for each synset inBC, its counterpart in KurdNet is definedsemi-automatically.
We first use Dictio (a Sorani-English dictionary, see Section 4.2) to translate itsliterals (words).
Having compiled the translationlists, we combine them in two different ways:(i) a maximal alignment (abbr.
max) which is asuperset of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment(abbr.
min) which is a subset of non-emptylists.
Figure 4 shows an illustration of these twocombination variants.
In future, we plan to apply95k 3  e 2k 2k 1  e 1Kmax  EKminFigure 4: An Illustration of a Synset in Base Con-cepts and its Maximal and Minimal AlignmentVariants in KurdNet (Aliabadi et al., 2014)BaseConceptsKurdNet(max)KurdNet(min)Synset No.4,689 3,801 2,145Literal No.11,171 17,990 6,248Usage No.2,645 89,950 31,240Table 1: The Main Statistical Properties of BaseConcepts and its Alignment in KurdNet (Aliabadiet al., 2014)more advanced techniques, similar to the graphalgorithms described in (Flati and Navigli, 2012).Usage Examples: we have taken a corpus-assisted approach to speed-up the process ofproviding usage examples for each aligned synset.To this end, we: (i) extract all sentences (820,203)of the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013),(ii) lemmatize the corpus to extract all the lemmas(278,873), and (iii) construct a lemma-to-sentenceinverted index.
In the current version of KurdNet,for each synset we build a pool of sentencesby fetching the first 5 sentences of each of itsliterals from the inverted list.
These pools willlater be assessed by lexicographers to filter outnon-relevant instances.
In future, more sophisti-cated approaches can be applied (e.g., exploitingcontextual information).Definitions: due to lack of proper translationtools, this element was aligned manually.
Webuilt a graphical user interface to facilitate thelexicographers?

In orderto expand the usability of KurdNet, the followingshortcomings must be overcome:3.1 Incomplete Coverage of KurdishVocabularyKurdNet has been built as an alignment for BaseConcepts and since Base Concepts contains onlya small subset of English vocabulary, KurdNet?scoverage is inevitably small.
Furthermore, as itcan be seen in Table 1, due to the limitations ofthe dictionaries used, not all English words in theBase Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) have an equiv-alent in KurdNet.
Hence the current mapping be-tween WordNet and KurdNet is only partial.
Fi-nally, the lexical idiosyncrasies between Kurdishand English should be identified and included inKurdNet.3.2 Refinement of Automatically-GeneratedContentEach synset must contain a comprehensive defini-tion and a practical example.
While KurdNet def-initions are provided manually and therefore en-joy high quality, the actual words in each synsetas well as the usage examples have been producedmanually.
In order to increase the reliability andcorrectness of KurdNets, there need to be mech-anisms to refine the existing machine-generatedcomponents.3.3 Limited Support for Semantic RelationTypesAs shown in Table 2, there are several WordNetsemantic relations for each syntactic categories.Each syntactic categories are organized to compo-nent files (Miller et al., 1993).
The most impor-tant semantic relation in WordNet is Hyponymyand this relation is the only one support in Kurd-Net (Aliabadi et al., 2014).963.4 Absence of Kurmanji SynsetsKurdish is considered a bi-standard3lan-guage (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012):the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-basedalphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in aLatin-based alphabet.
The linguistics featuresdistinguishing these two dialects are phonolog-ical, lexical, and morphological.
The importantmorphological differences that concern the con-struction of KurdNet are (MacKenzie, 1961;Haig and Matras, 2002): (i) in contrast to Sorani,Kurmanji has retained both gender (femininev.
masculine) and case opposition (absolute v.oblique) for nouns and pronouns, and (ii) whileis Kurmanji passive voice is constructed usingthe helper verb ?hatin?, in Sorani it is created viaverb morphology.
As explained in Section 2, thecurrent KurdNet prototype only covers the Soranidialect and therefore it should be extended toinclude the Kurmanji dialect as well.
This wouldrequire not only using similar resources to thosereported in this paper, but also building a mappingsystem between the Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.3.5 Dictionary ImperfectionsDictio, the dictionary that was used for buildingKurdNet, is relatively small.
We have recentlydiscovered new linguistics resources that can im-prove the quality of automatic translation of En-glish words and sentences into Kurdish and viceversa (see Section 4.2).4 KurdNet: Extension Plan4.1 Goals and Envisioned OutcomesThe main objectives and expected artefacts for thisproposals are the following:?
to refine the current prototype, through useof intelligent algorithms and/or manual assis-tance.?
to winden the scope (i.e., including Kurmanjisynsets), the coverage (i.e., going beyondBase Concepts) , and richness (supportingadditional semantic relations) of the currentversion.3Within KLPP, our focus has been on Sorani and Kur-manji which are the two most widely-spoken and closely-related dialects (Haig and Matras, 2002; Walther and Sagot,2010).?
to produce tool kits for users (e.g.
graphicalinterfaces), developers (e.g., drivers and pro-gramming interfaces), and contributors (e.g.,navigation/edition tools).?
to design and conduct experiments in order toassess the effectiveness of KurdNet in NLPand IR applications.?
to publish the innovative aspects as researchpapers.4.2 Available ResourcesBelow are the Kurdish language resources that canbe potentially used throughout this project:?

One useful ap-plication of these entries is to build a parallelcollection of named entities across both di-alects.4.3 MethodologyAs mentioned in Section 2, we have adoptedthe Expand model to build KurdNet.
Accordingto (Vossen, 1996), the MultiWordNet (MWN11)model (Expand model) seems less complex andguarantees the highest degree of compatibilityacross different wordnets.
The MWN model alsohas potential drawbacks.
The most serious riskis that of forcing an excessive dependency on thelexical and conceptual structure of one of the lan-guages involved, as (Vossen, 1996) points out.This risk can be considerably reduced by allow-ing the new wordnet to diverge, when necessary,from the PWN.Another important advantage of the MWNmodel is that automatic procedures can be devisedto speed up both the construction of correspond-ing synsets and the detection of divergences be-tween PWN and the wordnet being built.
Accord-ing to the Expand model, the aim is to build, when-ever possible, Kurdish synsets which are synony-mous (semantically correspondent) with the PWNsynsets.
The second strategy is based on Kurdish-to-English translations.
For each sense of a Kur-dish word K, we look for a PWN synset S in-cluding at least one English translation of K anda link between K and S is established (Pianta etal., 2002).For the correct alignment of Sorani and Kur-manji synsets, we propose to use three comple-mentary approaches:?
use of English (here, Base Concepts) synsetsas reference points between both dictionary-translated synsets of Sorani and Kurmanji.9http://ckb.wikipedia.org/10http://ku.wikipedia.org/11http://multiwordnet.fbk.eu/English Sorani Kurmanjiword1 S-translation1 K-translation1word2 S-translation2 K-translation2word3 K-translation3word4 S-translation4word5Table 4: English-Sorani and English-Kurmanjidictionaries structureThe results would be structured as shown inTable 4.?
development of a transliteration/translationengine between Sorani and Kurmanji, thatis capable of matching closely-related wordsand synstes.?
For the cases in which, more than one or nomapping has been found, manual filtering orinsertion will be used.4.4 Timing and LogisticsBased on our estimates, we plan to carry out theresearch highlighted in this paper in the course ofone-and-an-half to two years.
To this end, a time-line has been prepared (see Figure 5).
We believethat since the preliminary work on KurdNet (e.g.,literature review, development of the first proto-type) has already been completed, most of our re-sources will be dedicated to designing new algo-rithms and system building.Moreover, in terms of technical logistics, weare hopeful to receive full IT and library systemssupport from the Science and Research Branch Is-lamic Azad University(SRBIAU12) and Universityof Kurdistan(UoK13).5 SummaryIn this paper, we underlined the major shortcom-ings in the current KurdNet prototype and pro-posed a concrete plan to enrich the current pro-totype, so that it can be used in development ofKurdish language processing systems.AcknowledgmentThe authors would like to express their gratitudeto Yahoo!
