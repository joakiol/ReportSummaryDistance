Acoustic-Phonetics Based Speech RecognitionVictor W. ZueSpoken Language Systems GroupLaboratory for Computer ScienceMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyOBJECTIVE:The objective of this project is to develop a robust and high-performance speech recognitiotlsystem using a segment-based approach to phonetic recognition.
The recognition systemwill eventually be integrated with natural anguage processing to achieve spoken lallguagcunderstanding.SUMMA R Y OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS:Developed a phonetic recognition front-end and achieved 77% and 71% classiilcatiouaccuracy under speaker-dependent a d -independent conditions, respectively, using aset of 38 context-independent models.Collaborated with researchers at SRI in the development of the MISTRI system, mak-ing explicit use of acoustic-phonetic and phonological knowledge.Developed the SUMMIT speech recognition system that incorporates auditory mod-elling and explicit segmentation, and achieved a speaker-independent accuracy of 87%on the DARPA 1000-word Resource Management task using 75 phoneme models.Developed probabilistic natural anguage system, TINA, and achieved a test-set cov-erage of 78% with perplexity of 42 for the Resource Management task.?
Transcribed all 6300 sentences for the TIMIT database.Developed a set of research tools for the DARPA speech research community in ot'dcrto facilitate data collection, parameter computation, statistical analysis, and speechsynthesis.PLANS:Improve the speech recognition performance by incorporating context-dependency iaphoneme modelling.Integrate TINA into SUMMIT in order to develop spoken language understandingcapabilities.Develop a back-end on the task of a Knowledgeable Navigator, and integrate it withthe spoken language system.Begin hardware development, such that the system will soon be able to execute in nearreal-time.167
