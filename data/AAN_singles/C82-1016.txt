Academi~ 1982REFERENTIAL NETS WITH ATTRIBUTESChristopher U. Habel *ODe of the essential problems in natural language productionand understanding is the problem of processing referentialrelations.
In this paper I describe a model for representingand processing referential relations: referential nets withattributes.
Both processes (analyzing and generatingreferential expressions) are controlled by attributes.
Thereare two types of attributes, on one hand, the ones to theinternal substitutes of the objects spoken about, on the otherhand, the ones to the descriptions of these objects.I.
BASIC NOTIONS: KNOWLEDGE AND SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONIt is a well-known fact that (computational) models of human language productionand understanding have to take the knowledge of the speaker and the listener intoconsideration.
Thus, one of the main problems is to describe and represent thisknowledge and to distinguish relevant subtypes.
A suitable classification which Idescribed in detail in Habel \[7\] distinguishes three subtypes:- knowledge of facts or assertions, e.g.
of states of the world, events, etc.,the "factual knowledge',- knowledge of rules, e.g.
of rule-like relations between objects or states ofthe world (or classes of such entities), the "inferential knowledge',- knowledge of objects, e.g.
of persons in the world, the "referentialknowledge'.
(In this paper I give emphasis to the third type: referential knowledgerepresented by "Referential Nets').The common core for representing all these types of knowledge is the "semanticrepresentation language" SRL.
From the formal point of view SRL is a(propositional) symbolic language as described by Kalish/Montague \[8\].
Well-formedSRL-expressions are generated by normal (recursive) formation rules.
Idistinguish - as usual - two kinds of meaningful expressions in SRL, terms andformulas.
Thus we define:TER - the set of well-formed termsFOR - the set of well-formed formulasSRL = <FOR, TER>For the purpose of knowledge representation SRL contains some specific operators,e.g.on the factual level: tenses, beliefs, ......on the inferential level: entailment relation,...on the referential level: description operators of various types.Since SRL is a representation language, I now have to treat the central questionof "representation theory': What kinds of entities are represented by thedifferent entities of SRL?
Here I follow - with minor changes, which I will notdiscuss in this paper Miller \[I0\]: The expressions and entities of SRLrepresent cognitive concepts.
The operators correspond to different types of"concepts" in the Miller-approach, e.g.
predicative , nominal and modifyingconcepts (this third class are the "operators" of Miller.).
E.go by means ofdescription operators it is possible to construct nominal concepts from101102 CH.
U. HABELpredicative concepts or other nominal concepts.I shall now il lustrate SRL with an example.
In understanding and representing thesentence(i) I wil l  meet Barbara in the university tomorrow.the act of referring to "I", "Barbara", and "the university" is to be processed,i.e.
the (obJect-)orientation to them is the interesting problem from thereferential point of view.
The SRL representation of (i) is(2) time (meeting (l,Barbara, ETA(x) :university(x) ),tomorrow)The arguments of "time" and "meeting" present the most relevant types ofreferential operators: "I" and "tomorrow" are deictic substitutes (personal ortemporal), Barbara is a proper name and the expression "ETA(x): university(x)" isbuilt up from the nominal concept "'university" (representing a class ofinstitutions for education and science) and the variable-binding descriptionoperator "ETa'.
"ETA(x): p(x)" has the meaning "'an element from the class{x/p(x)>".
ETA is an indefinite analogy to the IOTA-operator of formal logics(Similar operators are introduced by Hilbert as EPSILON- or ETA-operator.).
Thesemantics of the description operators is given by a set of inference andevaluation rules.
E.g.
there is an inference rule which relates the ETA-expressions to expressions with existential quantification:(3) p (ETA(x)  : q(x)  ) ~ EX x : p(x)  & q(x)  1"Some evaluation rules wil l  be described in the following chapters, e.g.
"creationof a referential object'.
(Both types of rules are described in detail in Habel\[5\], \[6\].)
Thus, ETA is the formal representative of one of the meanings ofindefinite articles.Further descriptions of the objects mentioned in (i) or in the SRL expression (2)can be generated by (focussing) transformations similar to the solution ofalgebraic equations: The university mentioned above is also the one described by(4) ETA(x) :time ( meeting(l ,Barbara, university(x)),tomorrow ) 2~or the natural language equivalent "a (the) university where Barbara and I willmeet tomorrow".
(The uniqueness of the ETA-description depends on thesltuatlonal/textual context.
)Before we pass on to a detailed description of "referential nets', I will make ashort remark on discourse and communication.
As mentioned above human languageproduction and understanding is based on the speaker-l istener's knowledge of thelanguage, the world and particularly the participants in the communication.
Thus,I assume a discourse model 3* which is based Dn tripartite knowledge (namelyfactual, inferential, and referential), each of these types is represented bystructured sets of SRL-expressions.\2.
THE REFERENTIAL NETProcessing, e.g.
storing or retrieving, referential relations is executed by aparticular component of the discourse processing system, the "referentialprocedures" (ReP).
The RePs work on a memory structure which is adequate for therepresentation of knowledge about objects, the "referential net" (RefN) 4*.
A RefNconsists of entities of three different types:- referential objects (RefOs), which are the internal substitutes for the objectsspoken about,- descriptions, i.e.
terms of SRL which describe the RefOs,- attributes, i.e.
properties of the description-relation between a RefO and oneof its descriptions or properties of the RefO (see chap.
3).After detecting a new indefinite description (as ETA(x) : unlversity(x)) RePcreates a new "referential object'" (RefO).
During the discours6 (after theidentif ication process) further descriptions of the same RefO will be linked tothis RefO.
(The relation among the descriptions of the same RefO is the wellknownrelation of eoreference,) ~us  we have, for example, the fol lowing set ofdescriptions of the RefO mentioned above :(5) r .
l~ .~ d. II--ETA(x) : university(x)d.12-- ETA(x): time (meeting(l 'Barbara'university(x))'t?m?rr?w)d. I3-- IOTA(x) : professor-at(Barbara,university(x))REFERENTIAL NETS WITH ATTRIBUTF_~ 103For the description of the referential net I use SRL and in addition a "finite butextendable" set, REFO, of "referential objects'.
The referential objects areseen as a kind of basic term of SRL.
The set REFO is analogous to the set ofvariables.
The phrase "finite but extendable" is used to emphasize the dynamicaspect of the set REFO and the RefN.
REFO consists of exactly those RefOs that areactually needed.
It is necessary to distinguish two types of terms, one typewhich consists of the mental representatives, i.e.
the RefOs, and the other whichcontains those terms which function as descriptions.
Naming this set by D-TER wehave TER - REFO U D-TER.
Thus, referential nets, RefNs, can he defined as(6) RefN c D-TER x REFO ?For <d-ter, r.i> 6 RefN I also use "d-ter deser r.i'" , "d-ter is a descriptionof r.i".
In this way a description-relation is defined on the basis of the RefN.By means of referential nets it is possible, e.g.
to arrive at one object (i.e.RefO) via different aspects, i.e.
different descriptions, of this object.
It isonly by such aspects (cp.
Schank's \[II\] way o f  memory discrimination), that asystem is able to choose "'a best description" of the objects which are the themeof the discourse (see below).
The referential net (5) is simplif ied in twocrucial points, first, that the descriptions of r.l operate on MSRL ~press ionsand not on RefOs, too.
But this can be treated similarly to the focussing processof (4), which can be formallzed now:(7) p ( r .
i )  8--- r .
i  - -  ETA(x) : p(x)Using (7 ) ,  the  descr ip t ions  can be so lved  w i th  respect  to a l l  RefOs, i .e .
a l la rguments  a re  f i l l ed  by RefOs or  open terms.
Thus we can der ive  (8) from (5) :(8) r .
l~- - - - -  d. I I -ETA(x)  : un ivers i ty (x )d .12-ETA(x) :  t ime (meet ing( r .2 ,  r .3 ,  un lvers l ty (x ) ) ,  r .4 )d .13- IOTA(x)  : p ro fessor -a t ( r .3 ,  un ivers l ty (x ) )r .
2 - -  d .21- " I ' "r .3  - -  d .31- -Barbarar .
4 - -  d .41- " tomorrow"Secondly, ReP has tO explicate the referential links of deictlc substitutes, e.g.
"r" refers to the speaker, etc.. " " stands for the specif ic ReP which evaluatesdeictlc expressions, i.e.
which ins~antiates deictic ~xpressions with RefOs, e.g.
"I'" - SPEAKER(l) (cp.
fn 6.).
By the same methods new RefOs for "we" can becreated, e.g.
in the processing of "There we wil l  discuss some papers."
(We =Barbara + I)3.
ATTRIBUTES IN REFERENTIAL NETSI will now extend the basic two-place relation between RefOs and descriptions tothe more adequate concept of a many-place referential relation.
The additionalplaces wil l  be called "attributes'.
In the first step of extention I giveemphasis to "attributes of descriptions'.
They represent properties of thedescription relation, i.e.
of pairs <d, r> E RefN.
Thus, the extention to anattributed RefN (ARefN) uses a set ATT of attributes and changes (6) to(9) ARefN c ATT x D-TER x REFO .For <att, d, r > C ARefN I also say "'att is an attribute of d with regard to r".Some possible attributes are (Note the fact that this list is not complete and notfully adequate):- syntactic and semantic features of the description, e.g.
gender, number, sexus,etc.- numerical values, e.g.
"grades of relevance of a description", "degrees of"being the TOPIC / being in the FOCUS" ", "recency".
5* A simple strategy forde-/coding is: '~se/try the description or RefO with highest degrees !
'"- names of persons, e.g.
participants of earlier discourses.
By this attribute itis possible to find a description relevant to speaker and listener (Cp.
Clark /Marshall 's \[I\] co-presence triples).- situations in which the description / RefO Is relevant or was introduced (cp.Webber's \[12\] "evoke?-predicate).- links to the factual knowledge; thus we can answer such questions as "What willBarbara do tomorrow?
"104 CH.
U. HABELBefore I explain the concept of "attributes to descriptions" by some examples, Iwill new sketch some aspects of function and statue of the attributes.
Firstly, inboth processes, analysis as well as generation of referential expressions, it isnecessary to take into consideration a set of alternatives.
All of them arepossible candidates to be the referent (in analyzing) or to be a good description(in producing) respectively.
The goal of the ReP is to choose exactly one from thealternatives, namely "the best'.
It is obvious that trying to choose the best canfail.
Then the decision has to be revised afterwards.
(But this is a totaldifferent problem.)
In other words, the function of the attributes is to point tothe most appropriate (or being more careful: to that which seems to be the mostappropriate) of the alternatives.
Secondly, I think that, on one hand, knowing andprocessing attributes is part of human natural language processing, and therefore,these attributes have to be part of the discourse processing model.
On the otherhand, knowledge of attributes is different (cp.
the list of possible attributes,above) from the factual or referential knowledge.
Thus, I propose a strictseparation between descriptions and their attributes.
This strict distinctioncontrasts to Webber's \[12\] solution: her use of the "evoke'-predieate mixes theconcepts of descriptions and their attributes in a cognitive inadequate manner.Now I shall continue with examples of the use of attributes ?
Let us suppose asituation in which a questioner Q asks:(I0) Where can I study Computational Linguistics?and the answerer A knows that the university which is (internally) represented byr.l is a good university to study CL.
The selection of the best description of r.ldepends on Q and A (and the situational context).
I assume the followingattributes to the descriptions of r.l (from (5), (8)):(ii) descr, general relevant to: time of relevance:-d.ll "unspecified"-d.12 SPEAKER(I), LISTENER(1), Barbara NEIGHBOR(r.4) 6*-d.13 SPEAKER(1), LISTENER(I), KNOW(Barbara) always(II) describes a situation, in which the name / location of the university inquestion is not represented, e.g.
since the information about the possibility tostudy CLwas  given by an earlier utterance of Barbara "We have some courses in CL"but A (whose RefN is represented by (ii)) does not know where Barbara teaches.
Thebest description can be chosen by comparing the attributes of Q with those of thedescriptions of r.l.
If Q knows Barbara, .i.e.
<KNOW(Barbara)> ATT (Q) 7*, thenthe best description will be:(12) d.13 - "The university where Barbara teaches (as a professor).
"Ranking d.13 higher / better than d.12 depends on the dimension "time ofrelevance'.
Furthermore, if Q knows more about r.l it is possible that Q willreact with,(13) "Well, at Amherst.
'"and now A is able to extend hls/her RefN with a further description of r.l(14) r.l - d.14 - Amherst - -  "general high relevance" "always"(This attribute depends on the fact that proper names have high relevance ingeneral.
)Anagously we can use attributes in the decoding process.
Look at the followingpair of sentences (similar to (I)).
(15) a. I will meet the head of the linguistic department tomorrow.b.
She is a specialist for Montague grammar.To solve this referential problem ( and not to be puzzled by the pronoun "she" )we need further background knowledge, e.g.
"Barbara is the head of the linguisticdepartment.".
With this prior knowledge and the additional (theoretical) conceptof "attributes to RefOs" 8* as described in(16) "female" "local TOPIC'- r.3-- d.31- Barbarad.32- IOTA(x) : head-of(x ,linguist.
dept.
)the referential problem of (15) is easy to solve.
A system (human listener ormachine) has to match the pattern corresponding to the pronoun "she" ~ Ich  isinduced by the context (15.5) against the descriptions, their attributes and theattributes of the RefO's.
The crucial attribute is here "female" for both "she"and "r.3".This type of congruence between gender of the pronoun and sexus of the RefO, i.e.REFERENTIAL NETSWITHATTRIBUTES 105between attributes of descriptions and those of the RefOs, is very important inGerman.
In spite of the syntaetlc ineongruence (neutr.
vs.
fem.)
it is possible(in colloquial German) to say:(17) Ich traf gestern ein Maedchen.
Sle hatte rote Haare.I met  yesterday a glrl .
She had red hair .neutr.
~ fem.4.
CONCLUDING REMARKSBy means of an extended referential net (w~th attributes both of descriptions andRefOs) it is possible to describe how to store and process referential entities(and expressions) in a cognitive adequate and powerful way.Following the principles and concepts described above a system for anaphoraresolution has been implemented (Guenther \[3\]), which will be a component of thenext version of the BACON-system (cp.
fn 3).FOOTNOTES:* Parts of the first draft of this paper were prepared during my work with theproject "Automatic Construction of Semantic Nets" at the Technical Universityof Berlin.
My current research on "referential nets" has been supported by theDFG (German Research Foundation).

Rep. Germany.I* From a formal point of view "inference rules" are transformation rules on SRL.Their cognitive and philosphlcal status, which is analogous to Miller's \[I0\]"conceptual entailment', is described in }{abe\], \[7\].Here, i,e.
in (3), and in the focussing rule (7) "p" stands for all types ofconcepts which are represented by open formulas.2* The focussing transformation mentioned above is based on the concept ofreferential nets and therefore its description will be postponed to thefollowing chapter.
In (4) a special "bar-convention" is used, which I do notwant to explain in detail here.
In case a term is necessary as argument, e.g.of "meeting", the "bar" will change the open formula "p(x)'" to an "open term"3* Cp.
}{abel \[7\] and Gust / Hahel / Rollinger \[4\].
This model is the theoreticalbasis of the natural language QAS BACON (Berlin Automatic COnstruction ofsemantic Nets), developed at the Technical University of Berlin, which wassupported by a grant from the Federal Government since 1978.
It should not beconfused with the BACON-system of Carnegie-Mellon University (we chose the samename at the same time).4* The concept of referential nets is similar to discourse referents (Karttunen\[9\]), reference diaries (Clark/Marshall \ [1 \ ] )  and discourse models (Webber\[12\]).
The most relevant difference between referential nets and the otherapproaches and the main advantage of referential nets consist in the furtherattributes described below.Note the fact that the acrony=s ReP, RefN, etc.
can stand for the respectiveconcept, e.g.
"referential net', as well as for a specific instantlation, e.g.the RefN (5) or (8).
Furthermore ReP concerns the system of referentialprocedures as well as the individual procedures.
In all these cases the meaningof the acronym is obvious through context.5* In this paper TOPIC / FOCUS are used in an informal and intuitive way.
(For adetailed investigation of these concepts cp, Grosz.
\ [2 \ ] )  Note that theattribute "time of relevance" i:~ (ii) is part of TOPIC / FOCUS.106 CH.U.
HABEL6* SPEAKER(l) stands for "the speaker of utterance ( I ) ' ,  i.e.
this attributegives more information than Webber's \[12\] "evoke(l)'.
"KNOW(_)" represents"people knowing _'.
"NEIGHBOR(--)" stands for "points / periods of time near tothe point of time being the argument'.
I do not want to explain the underlying"logic of time" here.7* I wil l  not explain the concept of "attributes of a person / participant" here.I use it in a straightforward and intuitive manner.8* The extention to attributes of RefOs is analogous to that from (6) to (9):AARefN c ATT.
I x D-TER x (REDO x ATT.2) ?ATT.I stands for the attributes of descriptions, ATT.2 for the attributes /properties of RefOs.
AARefN is a "double attributed RefN'.
Note the fact thatsame of the attributes of the RefOs will  be computed from those ofdescriptions~ e.g.
"female" from a attribute of "Barbara'.REFERENCES:\ [ I \ ]  C la rk ,  H.H.
