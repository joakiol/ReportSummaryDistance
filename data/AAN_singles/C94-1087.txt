However, this model has beenclaimed to be inapproprialc \]or Korean morphologicalanalysis, because the complez" conjugation (inflection)and agglutination in word formation, and the syllabic-based representation oa t. worda may lead to a huge a'am-ber of two-level morphological rules, ht this paper, weshow that the twoJcvcl model can be succcs,sJully ap-plied to Korean and its rule size i~ limiled to only 52.Art czlensiou of two-level morphology is described forKorean language.INTROD U CT IONThe two-level morphology model (Koskenniemi, 1983;Antworth, 1990; Barton, 1986; l(~itchie, 199:1; Sproat,1992) is a well-known comi)u~,at, ional model of mor--phology, which ha~ adaptability a~ well ~u~ siml)lic-ity.
In t)ractice, this mo(M ha.s been successfully al)-.plied to several anguages including Finnish, El@ish,Japanese, II, ussim h and French.
However, the two-level model ha~ been considered to l)c inapl~rol)riatetbr Korean (Kang, 1992; Kwon, 1991).
That is, thetwo-level morphological nalysis of Korean is believedto be diliicuit and infcasible because the complex con-jugation (inItection) ainl agglutination i word forma-tion, and the syllable based representation of wordsmay lead to a huge mmlber of two-level morphologicMrules.
In this paper, we show that the two-level modelcan be successfully applied to Korean and its rule sizeis limited to only 52.This paper presents a successful two-lcvel system\[*or Korean morphological analysis.
The system wa.sba~ed on a shareware PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990);however, wc extended the I /O component of I'(J-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet HANUUL; wec(m.~,ructed a Korean dictionary and a Korean mor-phological grammar (i.e., morphotactics and spellingrules) tot the I'G-K1MMO; wc also used a sharewareKGI';N (Miles, 1!191) to translate the linguistic spellingrules into the executable automal, a (i.e., tinite statetransducers (FSTs)).
This paper focuses on the dic-tionary and the morphologicM grammar for Korcalt.TWO-LEVEL  REPRESENTAT ION OFKOREAN WORDSThe two lewd model is conceLned with directly map-ping bctwcen two rcprescntations of a word: (1) tilesur\]hcefo,'m (SF) ~ it appears in the text, and (2) thelexical \]orm (LF) which is represented ms a sequenceof ba.~ic morphs and diacritics (c.g., '+ '  to mark mor-.pheme boundary and '~ '  for word boundary).
As a resuit, an input word in the two-level modcl is analyzedby mapping the word itself (SF) to a sequence of le~ical forms in dictionary without intermediate stages.In this section, we present a two-level representationof i(ore~m words.'
lb understand the two-level description for Koreanntorphology, one should be properly familiar with Ko-rean alphabet mid their transcription system.
So wetirst describe them.
l"or ordinary writing system~ theKorean alphabet consists of 40 letters: l0 purc vowels,11 compound vowels, 14 basic consonants and 5 dou-ble consonants.
A Korean word is represented with asequence of syllables; a syllable can be made up of aconsonant, a vowel, and a consonant;  there are scv-.eral tbrms of syllables (e.g., CV~ CVC~ VC, V~ andC forms); and initial consonant lettcr may not bedistinguished front Iinal consonant letter, iiowever,the initiM consonant and the final consonant iiiust bedistinguished from each other for successful two-level535I ) l i reVowelsCompoundVowelsBasicConsonantsDoubleConsouantsTable 1: The transcrip.

Furthermore, towrite two-level spelling rules for PC-KIMMO, each ofKorean alphabet must be m~pped to ASCII characteron the keyboard.
Therefore, we devised a transcrip-tion system for Korean Mphabet a~ shown in Table l,which ha~ the following features:?
There is rio letter corresponding to the initial con-sonant , o,.
We did not consider the letter be-cause it is a sort of an orthographic filler \['or theordinary writing system and is not pronounced.?
The initiM consonant letters are not the same asthe finM consonant letters.
(To sec this, comparethe initial consonants MYGODE(I) with the finalconsonants MYCODE(F) in Table 1.)?
Each of compound vowels is represented by a pairof two letters: a semi-vowel letter (i.e., y or w)and one of pure vowel IO, ters excluding 'q l ' / f i /and 'a \ ] ' /5 / ;  here ,?\], and '-~t' are treated as thecompound vowels.?
There are two archiphoncnic letters: (1) thearchiphoneme A for the proper treatment of vowelharmony l, which can bc changed into NULL1Modern Korean hms a "diagonal" vowel harmony(Ahn, 1985) kept in only one area o\[ word formation, thatis, between the tinal vowel of a verbal stem and the follow-ing o-initial suffix.
This system works in the 0-initiM suffixsymbol 0, a vowel letter a, or a vowel letter 9by context; and (2) the arctfiphoneme I for theproper treatment of predicativc postposition 'ol'/ i / ,  which can be changed into either 0 or a vowelletter i by context.Wc believe that our transcription system makes it sim-ple and clear to describe two-level spelling rules of Ko-rean, and it enables the two-level processor to handleelliciently the complcx spelling changes.IIcre, three spccial symbols are used properly totreat lexical irregularities of Korcau verbal morphol-ogy: + for regularity, X for '/c'-irregularity, and $ forall irregularities excluding the '/d-irregularity; X mustbe differentiated from $ because of the following rea-sons.
In Korean morphology, most of verbal stemsending in the syllable '~ '  / / i /  are irregular.
The fi-nM syllable '~ ' / / i /o f  the stem, when tbllowed by thevowel '?t '  /o /  and preceded by any vowcl other thanthe light vowels ('o}' /a /  and '22 /o / ) ,  is changed into'e l ' / Io /and the consonant '~ ' / / / i s  added to the pre-ceding syllable.
We call it '/_'-irregularity.
For exam-plc, the vcrb stem '~ '  ~hi-{i~ (to flow) plus the suffix'ot' /0/ (INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word '~et '/hil-to/.
tlowever, there is 'le'-irrcgularity which oc-harmony where o has an alternation a if the final vowel of averbal stem is a light vowel a or o.
For exampl% the verbstem '_W /bol (to see) plus the sullix 'oI' /o/  (INFINI-TIVE) becomes the verbal word 'Lo~' /bo-a/.
tlowever,the verb stem '~'  /cu/ (to givc) plus the suffix '"t' /0/(INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word '.~o\]' ~co-O~.
Asa result, the archiphoncme A is used for the initial vowelo of suffixes, which is to distinguish it from 0 elsewhere.536curs in the same context ms 'L'-irregularity: it causesonly to be changed the following vowel 'o1' /o /  into'~t' l ie/ ;  for example, the verb stem 'o1~' li-~/(toarrive) plus the snflix '0t'/a/(INFINI'rlVE) becomesthe verbal word ' ?1 ~et ' / i - / i -  to/.
Therefore, a mecha-nism is needed to treat them properly.One of the special symbols is used to represent aspecific lexical form, and is ahnost placed at tlm e,d oftlle lexical form.
For example, the verbal stem tub hastwo meanings, i.e., "curved" as an adjective and "grill"as a verb.
Ill this case, the probleln is on the ditrcrencebetween the variation \[brine for adjective and those forverb; when it is combined with a sultix A, tim surfaceform becomes either the guile as adjective, or tim guwcas verb.
'Fo distinguish betwcen them, the followinglexical fi~rms can be listed in dictionary: gvH+ forregular adjective, and guH$ h)r '1\]'-irregular verb.WORD ST I{UCTURE AND LEX I -CONSThe word structure in general denotes knowledge oftin: internal morpheme combinations of known words.As a result, it shows how morl)hemes can combine tol'orm valid words; it is important to a proper wordrecognition.
In tim two-level model it is representedwith linked lexicons, i.e., with coniinvaliou claaaes ofmorphemes.The contimmtion chmses used in our lexicovs areas follows: i.terjection (IS), prenoun (Pit), adverb(A\]3), noun (iNN), pronou,l (PN), numeral (NU),verb (VB), adjective (AJ), verbalizer (Vit), postpo-sition (PP), l-po~tposition (I1'), nominal-prelix (NF),verbal-preIix (VF), preliual-ending (PE), final-ending(FE), nominal ending (NE) =, Begin, and End.
Everyclass indicates a lexicon, lIowew:r, the 11c9iu and Endare some special lexicons; llcgin amounts to the ini-tim state in automata, and End has tile same role asthe final state; in fact, there is no lcxical entry.

By way of an ex-ample, we explain the following Korean morphologicalal;ernation in the two-level framework.In Korcan, some verbals cnding in the final conso-nant B are irregular.
The final consonant B of thestein, when followed by a vowel, is changed into w.But it is not changed when followed by a consonant.For example, when an irregular verb doB (to help) iscombined with the suftix A, it is changed into dowa.hi the two-levd system, it is represented as follows:Lczical Representation: d o B $ + ASuTface Representation: d o w 0 0 a537This shows a correspondence b tween lexical repre-sentation and surface representation.
In PC-KIMMO,such a correspondence is represented with the notationlezieal-eharacter:surface-eharacter like d:d, o:o, B:w,8:0, +:0, and A:a. IIerc the lexieal character 8 is asignal indicating that a basic word or stem followedby it is irregular, and it corresponds to a surface O(the NULL symbol) which is not printed in the outputform.
The lexical 4- (a morpheme boundary symbol)also corresponds to a surface 0.The above alternation may be described as the fol-lowing two-level rule:B:w ?~ --- 8:0 4":0 A:@ (11 Variation lgule)This rule stales Lhat a lexical 11 is realized as asurface w if and only if it is followed by the conjuga-tion information 8, thc morpheme boundary 4", and alinking suflix A.
A surface @ in the above rule standsfor any alphabetic haractcr that constitutes a feasiblepair with a lexical A.
For example, the surface @ maybc realized ms a, c, or O whcrt all feasible pairs withlcxicM A arc like A:a, Arc, and A:O.The two-level rules cart be automatically translatedinto the state transition tables by using a rule compilersuch as TWOL (Karttunen, 1987) and KGEN (Miles,1991).
The tables built by KGEN may bc actuallyused in PC-KIMMO.
The above rule is translated byKGEN into the state transition table below:1:2.3.4.5:6:7:11 11 8 4" A @ (lcxieal charaelers)w @ 0 O @ @ (~urfacc characters)2 5 1 1 1 10 0 3 O 0 00 0 O 4 0 00 O 0 0 1 O2 5 6 1 i 12 5 I 7 1 12 5 1 1 0 1The rows of the table represent the seven states, inwhich linal states are marked with colons and nonfinalstates arc marked with periods.
The columns repre-sent arcs frorn one state to another.
A zero transitionindicates that there is no valid transition from thatstate for that input symbol.CONCLUSIONWe have shown that the two-level morphology model,which has bccn claimed to be inappropriate for Ko-rean, can be successfully applied to Korean.
Thatis, we have implemented a successful two-level mor-phology system for Korean (see APPENDIX).
Thissystem was ba~cd on PC-KIMMO which is a share-ware.
Itowever, we modified the I /O component ofPC-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet HANGUL;we have constructed a Korean dictionary for the PC-KIMMO, which contains about 12,000 entries; we rep-resented a Korean morphotactics for the PC-KIMMO,which indicates the morphological structures of knownwords; we wrote 52 two-level spelling rules for thePG-KIMMO, which rccovcr almost all spelling alter-nations in Korean morphology.Our two-level system has been experimented with2,172 randomly words selected from Korean textbooks(413,975 words) for elementary education.
For thistest set, the system produces the correct outputs al-though it includes about 5% extra incorrect analyses(i.e., overgeneration).
IIcre the overgeneration is as-cribed to the fact that it results from the weak ex-pressive power of morphotactic information in PC-KIMMO.REFERENCESAhn, S. C. (1985).
