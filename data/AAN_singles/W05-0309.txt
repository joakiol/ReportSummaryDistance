Proceedings of the Workshop on Frontiers in Corpus Annotation II: Pie in the Sky, pages 61?67,Ann Arbor, June 2005. c?2005 Association for Computational LinguisticsA Parallel Proposition Bank II for Chinese and English?Martha Palmer, Nianwen Xue, Olga Babko-Malaya, Jinying Chen, Benjamin SnyderDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceUniversity of Pennsylvania{mpalmer/xueniwen/malayao/Jinying/bsnyder3}@linc.cis.upenn.eduAbstractThe Proposition Bank (PropBank) projectis aimed at creating a corpus of text an-notated with information about seman-tic propositions.
The second phase ofthe project, PropBank II adds additionallevels of semantic annotation which in-clude eventuality variables, co-reference,coarse-grained sense tags, and discourseconnectives.
This paper presents the re-sults of the parallel PropBank II project,which adds these richer layers of semanticannotation to the first 100K of the ChineseTreebank and its English translation.
Ourpreliminary analysis supports the hypoth-esis that this additional annotation recon-ciles many of the surface differences be-tween the two languages.1 IntroductionThere is a pressing need for a consensus on a task-oriented level of semantic representation that can en-able the development of powerful new semantic ana-lyzers in the same way that the Penn Treebank (Mar-cus et al, 1993) enabled the development of sta-tistical syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak,2001).
We believe that shallow semantics expressedas a dependency structure, i.e., predicate-argumentstructure, for verbs, participial modifiers, and nom-inalizations provides a feasible level of annotationthat would be of great benefit.
This annotation, cou-pled with word senses, minimal co-reference links,?This work is funded by the NSF via Grant EIA02-05448 .event identifiers, and discourse and temporal rela-tions, could provide the foundation for a major ad-vance in our ability to automatically extract salientrelationships from text.
This will in turn facilitatebreakthroughs in message understanding, machinetranslation, fact retrieval, and information retrieval.The Proposition Bank project is a major step towardsproviding this type of annotation.
It takes a prac-tical approach to semantic representation, adding alayer of predicate argument information, or seman-tic roles, to the syntactic structures of the Penn Tree-bank (Palmer et al, 2005).
The Frame Files thatprovide guidance to the annotators constitute a richEnglish lexicon with explicit ties between syntac-tic realizations and coarse-grained senses, Frame-sets.
PropBank Framesets are distinguished primar-ily by syntactic criteria such as differences in sub-categorization frames, and can be seen as the top-level of an hierarchy of sense distinctions.
Group-ings of fine-grained WordNet senses, such as thosedeveloped for Senseval2 (Palmer et al, to appear)provide an intermediate level, where groups are dis-tinguished by either syntactic or semantic criteria.WordNet senses constitute the bottom level.
ThePropBank Frameset distinctions, which can be madeconsistently by humans and systems (over 90% ac-curacy for both), are surprisingly compatible withthe groupings; 95% of the groups map directly ontoa single PropBank frameset sense (Palmer et al,2004).The semantic annotation provided by PropBankis only a first approximation at capturing the fullrichness of semantic representation.
Additional an-notation of nominalizations and other noun pred-61icates has already begun at NYU.
This paper de-scribes the results of PropBank II, a project to pro-vide richer semantic annotation to structures thathave already been propbanked, specifically, eventu-ality ID.s, coreference, coarse-grained sense tags,and discourse connectives.
Of special interest to themachine translation community is our finding, pre-sented in this paper, that PropBank II annotation rec-onciles many of the surface differences of the twolanguages.2 PropBank IPropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) is an annotation ofthe Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn TreebankII (Marcus et al, 1994) with ?predicate-argument?structures, using sense tags for highly polysemouswords and semantic role labels for each argument.An important goal is to provide consistent seman-tic role labels across different syntactic realizationsof the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0 John]broke [ARG1 the window] and [ARG1 The window]broke.
PropBank can provide frequency counts for(statistical) analysis or generation components ina machine translation system, but provides only ashallow semantic analysis in that the annotation isclose to the syntactic structure and each verb is itsown predicate.In PropBank, semantic roles are defined on averb-by-verb basis.
An individual verb?s seman-tic arguments are simply numbered, beginning with0.
Polysemous verbs have several framesets, cor-responding to a relatively coarse notion of wordsenses, with a separate set of numbered roles, a role-set, defined for each Frameset.
For instance, leavehas both a DEPART Frameset ([ARG0 John] left[ARG1 the room]) and a GIVE Frameset, ([ARG0I] left [ARG1 my pearls] [ARG2 to my daughter-in-law] [ARGM-LOC in my will].)
While most Frame-sets have three or four numbered roles, as manyas six can appear, in particular for certain verbs ofmotion.
Verbs can take any of a set of general,adjunct-like arguments (ARGMs), such as LOC (lo-cation), TMP (time), DIS (discourse connectives),PRP (purpose) or DIR (direction).
Negations (NEG)and modals (MOD) are also marked.There are several other annotation projects,FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998), Salsa (Ellsworth etal., 2004), and the Prague Tectogrammatics (Haji-cova and Kucerova, 2002), that share similar goals.Berkeley.s FrameNet project, (Baker et al, 1998;Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al, 2002)is committed to producing rich semantic frames onwhich the annotation is based, but it is less con-cerned with annotating complete texts, concentrat-ing instead on annotating a set of examples for eachpredicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives),and attempting to describe the network of relationsamong the semantic frames.
For instance, the buyerof a buy event and the seller of a sell event wouldboth be Arg0.s (Agents) in PropBank, while inFrameNet one is the BUYER and the other is theSELLER.
The Salsa project (Ellsworth et al, 2004)in Germany is producing a German lexicon basedon the FrameNet semantic frames and annotating alarge German newswire corpus.
PropBank style an-notation is being used for verbs which do not yethave FrameNet frames defined.The PropBank annotation philosophy has beenextended to the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank(Xue and Palmer, 2003).
The Chinese PropBank an-notation is performed on a smaller (250k words) andyet growing corpus annotated with syntactic struc-tures (Xue et al, To appear).
The same syntac-tic alternations that form the basis for the EnglishPropBank annotation also exist in robust quantitiesin Chinese, even though it may not be the case thatthe same exact verbs (meaning verbs that are closetranslations of one another) have the exact samerange of syntactic realization for Chinese and En-glish.
For example, in (1), ?#c/New Year???/reception?
plays the same role in (a) and (b), whichis the event or activity held, even though it occurs indifferent syntactic positions.
Assigning the same ar-gument label, Arg1, to both instances, captures thisregularity.
It is worth noting that the predicate /?1/hold?
does not have passive morphology in (1a),despite what its English translation suggests.
Likethe English PropBank, the adjunct-like elements re-ceive more general labels like TMP or LOC, as alsoillustrated in (1).
The functional tags for Chineseand English PropBanks are to a large extent similarand more details can be found in (Xue and Palmer,2003).

?3 A Parallel PropBank IIAs discussed above, PropBank II adds richer se-mantic annotation to the PropBank I predicate ar-gument structures, notably eventuality variables,co-references, coarse-grained sense tags (Babko-Malaya et al, 2004; Babko-Malaya and Palmer,2005), and discourse connectives (Xue, To appear)To create our parallel PropBank II, we began withthe first 100K words of the Chinese Treebank whichhad already been propbanked, and which we hadhad translated into English.
The English transla-tion was first treebanked and then propbanked, andwe are now in the process of adding the PropBankII annotation to both the English and the Chinesepropbanks.
We will discuss our progress on each ofthe three individual components of PropBank II inturn, bringing out translation issues along the waythat have been highlighted by the additional anno-tation.
In general we find that this level of abstrac-tion facilitates the alignment of the source and tar-get language descriptions: event ID.s and eventcoreferences simplify the mappings between verbaland nominal events; English coarse-grained sensetags correspond to unique Chinese lemmas; and dis-course connectives correspond well.3.1 Eventuality variablesPositing eventuality1 variables provides a straight-forward way to represent the semantics of adver-bial modifiers of events and capture nominal andpronominal references to events.
Given that the ar-guments and adjuncts for the verbs are already an-notated in Propbank I, adding eventuality variablesis for the most part straightforward.
The examplein (2) illustrates a Propbank I annotation, which isidentified with a unique event id in Propbank II.1The term ?eventuality?
is used here to refer to events andstates.
(2) a. Mr. Bush met him privately in the White House onThursday.b.
Propbank I: Rel: met, Arg0: Mr. Bush, Arg1: him,ArgM-MNR: privately, ArgM-LOC: in the WhiteHouse, ArgM-TMP: on Thursday.c.
Propbank II: ?e meeting(e) & Arg0(e,Mr.
Bush) &Arg1(e, him) & MNR (e, privately) & LOC(e, in theWhite House) & TMP (e, on Thursday).Annotation of event variables starts by auto-matically associating all Propbank I annotationswith potential event ids.
Since not all annotationsactually denote eventualities, we manually filterout selected classes of verbs.
We further attemptto identify all nouns and nominals which describeeventualities as well as all sentential arguments ofthe verbs which refer to events.
And, finally, partof the PropBank II annotation involves tagging ofevent coreference for pronouns as well as emptycategories.
All these tasks are discussed in moredetail below.Identifying event modifiers.
The actual annota-tion starts from the presumption that all verbs areevents or states and nouns are not.
All the verbs inthe corpus are automatically assigned a unique eventidentifier and the manual part of the task becomes (i)identification of verbs or verb senses that do not de-note eventualities, (ii) identification of nouns that dodenote events.
For example, in (3), begin is an as-pectual verb that does not introduce an event vari-able, but rather modifies the verb -take., as issupported by the fact that it is translated as an ad-verb ??/initially?
in the corresponding Chinese sen-tence.

This is true2The problem of identifying nouns which denote events isaddressed as part of the sense-tagging tagging.
Detailed discus-sion can be found in (Babko-Malaya and Palmer, 2005).63for both English and Chinese, as is illustrated in (4).Both /u?/develop0and /\/deepening0arenominalized verbs that denote events.
Having a par-allel propbank annotated with event variables allowsus to see how events are lined up in the two lan-guages and how their lexical realizations can vary.The nominalized verbs in Chinese can be translatedinto verbs or their nominalizations, as is shown inthe alternative translations of the Chinese originalin (4).
What makes this particular example evenmore interesting is the fact that the adjective mod-ifier of the events, /?
?/continued0, can ac-tually be realized as an aspectual verb in English.The semantic representations of the Propbank II an-notation, however, are preserved: both the aspec-tual verb /continue0in English and the adjective/?
?/continued0in Chinese are modifiers of theevents denoted by /u?/development0and /\/deepening0.

In other cases, neither language has anovert pronoun, although one is posited in the tree-bank annotation, as in (7).

On the other hand, the Chinese PropBankhas more lemmas (including stative verbs which aregenerally translated into adjectives in English) nor-malized by the corpus size.
The Chinese PropBankhas 4854 lemmas in the 250K words that have beenpropbanked alone, while the English PropBank hasjust 3635 lemmas in the entire 1 million words cor-pus.
Of the 4854 Chinese lemmas, only 62 of themhave 3 or more framesets.
In contrast, 294 lemmashave 3 or more framesets in the English Propbank.64Verb English senses Chinese translationsappearbe or have a quality of being w,?ycome forth, become known or visible, physically or figuratively ?y,?ypresent oneself formally, usually in a legal setting ?

?inovke, elicit, set off J,J?Table 1: English verbs and their translations in the parallel PropbankIn our sense-tagging part of the project, we havebeen using manual groupings of the English Word-Net senses.
These groupings were previously shownto reconcile a substantial portion of the tagging dis-agreements, raising inter-annotator agreement from71% in the case of fine-grained WordNet senses to82% in the case of grouped senses for the Sense-val 2 English data (Palmer et al, to appear), andcurrently to 89% for 93 new verbs (almost 12K in-stances) (Palmer et al, 2004).
The question whicharises, however, is how useful these grouped sensesare and whether the level of granularity which theyprovide is sufficient for such applications as machinetranslation from English to Chinese.In a preliminary investigation, we randomly se-lected 7 verbs and 5 nouns and looked at their corre-sponding translations in the Chinese Propbank.
Asthe tables below show, for 6 verbs (join, pass, set-tle, raise, appear, fight) and 3 nouns (resolution, or-ganization, development), grouped English sensesmap to unique Chinese translation sets.
For a fewexamples, which include realize and party, groupedsenses map to the same word in Chinese, preservingthe ambiguity.
This investigation justifies the appro-priateness of the grouped sense tags, and indicatespotential for providing a useful level of granularityfor MT.3.3 Discourse connectivesAnother component of the Chinese / English ParallelPropbank II is the annotation of dis-course connec-tives for both Chinese corpus and its English trans-lation.
Like the other two components, the anno-tation is performed on the first 100K words of theParallel Chinese English Treebank.
The annotationof Chinese discourse connectives follows in largepart the theoretic assumptions and annotation prac-tices of the English Penn Discourse Project (PDTB)(Miltsakaki et al, 2004).
Adaptations are made onlywhen they are warranted by the linguistic facts ofChinese.

Ex-plicit discourse connectives include subordinate (8)and coordinate conjunctions (9) as well as discourseadverbials (10).
While subordinate and coordinateconjunctions are easy to understand, discourse ad-verbials need a little more elaboration.
Discourseadverbials differ from other adverbials in that theyrelate two propositions.
Typically one can be foundin the immediate context while the other may needto be identified in the previous discourse.

It highlighted some in-teresting aspects of the differences between Englishand Chinese, which play an important role for MTand other applications.
Some of the questions ad-dressed had to do with how events are lexicalizedand aligned in the two languages, which level ofsense granularity is needed for MT from Englishto Chinese, and highlighting notable differences be-tween discourse connectives in the two languages.Further investigation and alignment of the parallelcorpus, as well as richer annotation, will reveal otherinteresting phenomena.ReferencesOlga Babko-Malaya and Martha Palmer.
