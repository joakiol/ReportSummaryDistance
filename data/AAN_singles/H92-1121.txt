TACITUS:  RESEARCH IN TEXT UNDERSTANDINGJerry R. Hobbs, Principal InvestigatorArtificial Intelligence CenterSRI InternationalMenlo Park, California 94025PROJECT GOALSThe aim of the TACITUS project is to develop a gen-eral, domain-independent capability for text understand-ing that allows for variable levels of analysis, dependingon the requirements of the task.
Four stages of process-ing are being developed: preprocessing, syntactic analy-sis, inferential pragmatics processing, and template gen-eration.
Template generation is a straightforward pro-gramming task, but the other three stages of processingconsititute research issues.Our specific goals in these three areas are as follows:P reprocess ing :  To build as much of the processing aspossible into linear-time, string-based, finite-state meth-ods, in order to achieve fast, highly accurate processing.Syntact i c  Analysis: To develop the capability of pars-ing full, syntactically complex sentences in real-worldtexts, choosing among alternative parses with a high de-gree of precision, and recovering most of the informationin sentences in cases of parser failure.In ferent ia l  P ragmat ics  Process ing:  To implementmethods for dealing with various pragmatics prob-lems, such as schema recognition, reference resolution,metonymy resolution, the interpretation of vague predi-cates, and the resolution of various ambiguities, using ascheme of weighted abductive inference.RECENT RESULTSOur recent successes in each of these areas are as follows:P reprocess ing :  We implemented a keyword-based sta-tistical filter to select the relevant sentences in the cor-pus.
This eliminates 75% of the sentences from deeperanalysis, but only eliminates about 10% of the relevantsentences.
In addition, we developed highly successfulmethods for dealing with unknown words.Syntact i c  Analysis: We developed a bottom-up,agenda-based parser which produces the best n parses,together with their logical forms.
We were able to pro-duce a correct or nearly correct parse for 75% of the sen-tences under 30 words in the MUC-3 corpus.
We also de-veloped a new method, called "terminal substring pars-ing" for parsing sentences of over 60 words, and heuris-tics for extracting whatever structure was found in casesof failed parses, allowing us to recover nearly 90% of thepropositional content.In ferent ia l  P ragmat ics  Process ing:  An inferencecomponent, based on the Prolog Technology TheoremProver (PTTP)  has been developed and refined.
It usesa knowledge base encoding commonsense and domain-specific knowledge in the form of over 1000 axioms.
Thiscomponent allows us to extract information from somequite complex texts with a high degree of accuracy.
Inthe MUC-3 evaluation, it resulted in our precision beinghigher than any of the other sites tested.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAROur plans for the coming year are as follows:P reprocess ing:  We are beginning to implement a con-siderably more powerful preprocessing component, in aneffort to build as much capability as possible into linear-time, string-based, finite-state methods.
This compo-nent alone is intended to produce passable results in thetemplate-generation task.Syntact ic  Analysis:  We will work primarily on incre-mental refinements.In ferent ia l  P ragmat lcs  Process ing:  We are improv-ing the theorem prover in a number of ways and increas-ing the size of our knowledge base, as will be required inorder to raise our recall.
We are investigating how bestto use the results of our enhanced preprocessing in the in-ferential processing--whether to use them as defaults incase inferential processing fails, to use them for helpingguide the search for relevant information, or to have in-ferential processing attempt o refute them.
The deeperprocessing provided by the syntactic and inference com-ponents is more reliable than preprocessing alone, butrequires ubstantially more time.
We need to discoverthe best way to blend information from both sources.488
