We present amethodfor automatic dentification ofnon-compositional ex-pressions using their statistical properties in a textcorpus.
Our method is based on the hypothesis thatwhen a phrase is non-composition, itsmutual infor-mation differs significantly from the mutual infor-mations of phrases obtained by substituting one ofthe word in the phrase with a similar word.1 Int roduct ionNon-compositional expressions present a specialchallenge to NLP applications.
In machine transla-tion, word-for-word translation ofnon-compositionalexpressions can result in very misleading (sometimeslaughable) translations.
In information retrieval, ex-pansion of words in a non-compositional expressioncan lead to dramatic decrease in precision withoutany gain in recall.
Less obviously, non-compositionalexpressions eed to be treated ifferently than otherphrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLPmethods.
For example, an underlying assumption isome word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Da-gan and Itai, 1994; Li et al, 1995; Lin, 1997), is thatif two words occurred in the same context, they areprobably similar.
Suppose we want to determine theintended meaning of "product" in "hot product".We can find other words that are also modified by"hot" (e.g., "hot car") and then choose the mean-ing of "product" that is most similar to meaningsof these words.
However, this method fails whennon-compositional expressions are involved.
For in-stance, using the same algorithm to determine themeaning of "line" in "hot line", the words "product","merchandise", "car", etc., would lead the algorithmto choose the "line of product" sense of "line".We present a method for automatic identificationof non-compositional expressions using their statis-tical properties in a text corpus.
The intuitive ideabehind the method is that the metaphorical usageof a non-compositional expression causes it to havea different distributional characteristic than expres-sions that are similar to its literal meaning.2 Input  DataThe input to our algorithm is a collocation databaseand a thesaurus.
We briefly describe the process ofobtaining this input.
More details about the con-struction of the collocation database and the the-saurus can be found in (Lin, 1998).We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpuswith Minipar, 1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993;Lin, 1994), and extracted ependency relationshipsfrom the parsed corpus.
A dependency relationshipis a triple: (head type modif ier) ,  where head andmodif ier are words in the input sentence and typeis the type of the dependency relation.
For example,(la) is an example dependency tree and the set ofdependency triples extracted from (la) are shown in(lb).complJohn married Peter's isterb.
(marry V:subj:N John), (marryV:compl:N sister), (sister N:gen:N Peter)There are about 80 million dependency relation-ships in the parsed corpus.
The frequency counts ofdependency relationships are filtered with the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).
We call a depen-dency relationship a collocation if its log-likelihoodratio is greater than a threshold (0.5).
The numberof unique collocations in the resulting database 2 isabout 11 million.Using the similarity measure proposed in (Lin,1998), we constructed a corpus-based thesaurus 3consisting of 11839 nouns, 3639 verbs and 5658 ad-jective/adverbs which occurred in the corpus at least100 times.3 Mutua l  In format ion of aCol locat ionWe define the probability space to consist of all pos-sible collocation triples.
We use LH R M L to denote the1 available at http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/-lindek/minipar.htm/2available at http://www.cs.umanitob&.ca/-lindek/nlldemo.htm/3available at http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/-lindek/nlldemo.htm/317frequency count of all the collocations that matchthe pattern (H R M), where H and M are either wordsor the wild card (*) and R is either a dependencytype or the wild card.
For example,?
\[marry V:?ompl:N sister\[ is the frequency count of(marry V: compl :N s i s te r ) .?
\[marry V:compl:~ *1 is the total frequency count ofcollocations in which the head is marry and thetype is V:compl:hi (the verb-object relation).?
I* * *l is the total frequency count of all collo-cations extracted from the corpus.To compute the mutual information i  a colloca-tion, we treat a collocation (head type modif ier)as the conjunction of three events:A: (* type *)B: (head * *)C: (* * modif ier)The mutual information of a collocation is the log-arithm of the ratio between the probability of thecollocation and the probability of events A, B, andC co-occur if we assume B and C are conditionallyindependent given A:(2)mutualInfo(head, type, modifier)P(A,B,c)= log P(B\[A)P(C\[A)P(A)\[head type modifier\[* * *\]= log( \[, type *\[ \[head type *\[ \[* t~Te modifier\[ )\[* * *\[ \[* type *1 \ [ * type  *1?

Using the au-tomatically constructed thesaurus, we find the fol-lowing top-10 most similar words to the verb "spill"and the noun "gut":spill: leak 0.153, pour 0.127, spew 0.125, dump0.118, pump 0.098, seep 0.096, burn 0.095, ex-plode 0.094, burst 0.092, spray 0.091;gut: intestine 0.091, instinct 0.089, foresight 0.085,creativity 0.082, heart 0.079, imagination 0.076,stamina 0.074, soul 0.073, liking 0.073, charisma0.071;The collocation "spill gut" occurred 13 times in the125-million-word corpus.
The mutual informationof this collocation is 6.24.
Searching the collocationdatabase, we find that it does not contain any collo-cation in the form (simvspilt V:compl:hl gut) nor( sp i l l  V: compl :N simngut), where sirnvsp~u is averb similar to "spill" and simng,,~ is a noun sim-ilar to "gut".
This means that the phrases, suchas "leak gut", "pour gut", ... or "spill intestine","spill instinct", either did not appear in the corpusat all, or did not occur frequent enough to pass thelog-likelihood ratio test.The second example is "red tape".
The top-10most similar words to "red" and "tape" in our the-saurus are:red: yellow 0.164, purple 0.149, pink 0.146, green0.136, blue 0.125, white 0.122, color 0.118, or-ange 0.111, brown 0.101, shade 0.094;tape: videotape 0.196, cassette 0.177, videocassette0.168, video 0.151, disk 0.129, recording 0.117,disc 0.113, footage 0.111, recorder 0.106, audio0.106;The following table shows the frequency and mutualinformation of "red tape" and word combinationsin which one of "red" or "tape" is substituted by asimilar word:Table 1: red tapemutualverb object freq infored tape 259 5.87yellow tape 12 3.75orange tape 2 2.64black tape 9 1.07Even though many other similar combinations ex-ist in the collocation database, they have very differ-ent frequency counts and mutual information valuesthan "red tape".Finally, consider a compositional phrase: "eco-nomic impact".
The top-10 most similar words are:economic: financial 0.305, political 0.243, social0.219, fiscal 0.209, cultural 0.202, budgetary0.2, technological 0.196, organizational 0.19,ecological 0.189, monetary 0.189;impact: effect 0.227, implication 0.163, conse-quence 0.156, significance 0.146, repercussion0.141, fallout 0.141, potential 0.137, ramifica-tion 0.129, risk 0.126, influence 0.125;The frequency counts and mutual information val-ues of "economic impact" and phrases obtained byreplacing one of "economic" and "impact" with asimilar word are in Table 4.
Not only many combi-nations are found in the corpus, many of them havevery similar mutual information values to that of318Table 2: economic impactverbeconomicfinancialpoliticalsocialbudgetaryecologicaleconomiceconomiceconomiceconomiceconomiceconomiceconomiceconomiceconomicobjectimpactimpactimpactimpactimpactimpacteffectimplicationconsequencesignificancefalloutrepercussionpotentialramificationriskmutualfreq info171 1.85127 1.7246 0.5015 0.948 3.204 2.5984 0.7017 0.8059 1.8810 0.847 1.667 1.8427 1.248 2.1917 -0.33nomial distribution can be accurately approximatedby a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).
Sinceall the potential non-compositional expressions thatwe are considering have reasonably arge frequencycounts, we assume their distributions are normal.Let Ihead 1;ype modi f ie r  I = k and 1.
* .1 = n. Themaximum likelihood estimation of the true proba-bility p of the collocation (head type modif ier) is/5 = ~.
Even though we do not know what p is, sincep is (assumed to be) normally distributed, there isN% chance that it falls within the intervalk_.4_ZN _ k.4_z N n ,~,n V n n n nwhere ZN is a constant related to the confidence l velN and the last step in the above derivation isdue tothe fact that k is very small.
Table 3 shows the z~values for a sample set of confidence intervals.
"economic impact".
In fact, the difference of mu-tual information values appear to be more impor-tant to the phrasal similarity than the similarity ofindividual words.
For example, the phrases "eco-nomic fallout" and "economic repercussion" are in-tuitively more similar to "economic impact" than"economic implication" or "economic significance",even though "implication" and "significance" havehigher similarity values to "impact" than "fallout"and "repercussion" do.These examples suggest that one possibleway to separate compositional phrases and non-compositional ones is to check the existence and mu-tual information values of phrases obtained by sub-stituting one of the words with a similar word.
Aphrase is probably non-compositional if such sub-stitutions are not found in the collocation databaseor their mutual information values are significantlydifferent from that of the phrase.5 A lgor i thmIn order to implement the idea of separating non-compositional phrases from compositional ones withmutual information, we must use a criterion to de-termine whether or not the mutual information val-ues of two collocations are significantly different.
Al-though one could simply use a predetermined thresh-old for this purpose, the threshold value will be to-tally arbitrary, b-hrthermore, such a threshold oesnot take into account the fact that with different fre-quency counts, we have different levels confidence inthe mutual information values.We propose a more principled approach.
The fre-quency count of a collocation is a random variablewith binomial distribution.
When the frequencycount is reasonably arge (e.g., greater than 5), a bi-Table 3: Sample ZN valuesIN% 150% 80% 90% 95% 98% 99% Izg 0.67 1.28 1.64 1.96 2.33 2.58We further assume that the estimations of P(A),P(B\]A) and P(CIA ) in (2) are accurate.
The confi-dence interval for the true probability gives rise to aconfidence interval for the true mutual information(mutual information computed using the true proba-bilities instead of estimations).
The upper and lowerbounds of this interval are obtained by substitutingk with k+z~v'-g and k-z~vff in (2).
Since our con- n n nfidence of p falling between k+,~v~ is N%, we canI%have N% confidence that the true mutual informa-tion is within the upper and lower bound.We use the following condition to determinewhether or not a collocation is compositional:(3) A collocation a is non-compositional if theredoes not exist another collocation/3 such that(a) j3 is obtained by substituting the head orthe modifier in a with a similar word and (b)there is an overlap between the 95% confidenceinterval of the mutual information values of aand f~.For example, the following table shows the fre-quency count, mutual information (computed withthe most likelihood estimation) and the lower andupper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of thetrue mutual information:freq.

One possibility is to compare the automati-cally identified relationships with relationships li tedin a manually compiled dictionary.
For example,(Lin, 1998) compared automatically created the-saurus with the WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) andRoget's Thesaurus.
However, since the lexicon usedin our parser is based on the WordNet, the phrasalwords in WordNet are treated as a single word.For example, "take advantage of" is treated as atransitive verb by the parser.
As a result, theextracted non-compositional phrases do not usu-ally overlap with phrasal entries in the WordNet.Therefore, we conducted the evaluation by manu-ally examining sample results.
This method wasalso used to evaluate automatically identified hy-ponyms (Hearst, 1998), word similarity (Richardson,1997), and translations of collocations (Smadja etal., 1996).Our evaluation sample consists of 5 most frequentopen class words in the our parsed corpus: {have,company, make, do, take} and 5 words whose fre-quencies are ranked from 2000 to 2004: {path, lock,resort, column, gulf}.
We examined three types ofdependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun,and adjective-noun.
A total of 216 collocations wereextracted, shown in Appendix A.We compared the collocations in Appendix A withthe entries for the above 10 words in the NTC'sEnglish Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID)(Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains ap-proximately 6000 definitions of idioms.
For our eval-uation purposes, we selected the idioms in NTC-EIDthat satisfy both of the following two conditions:(4) a. the head word of the idiom is one of theabove 10 words.b.
there is a verb-object, noun-noun, oradjective-noun relationship in the idiomand the modifier in the phrase is not avariable.
For example, "take a stab atsomething" is included in the evaluation,whereas "take something at face value" isnot.There are 249 such idioms in NTC-EID, 34 of whichare also found in Appendix A (they are marked withthe '+' sign in Appendix A).
If we treat the 249 en-tries in NTC-EID as the gold standard, the precisionand recall of the phrases in Appendix A are shown inTable 4, To compare the performance with manuallycompiled ictionaries, we also compute the precisionand recall of the entries in the Longman Dictionaryof English Idioms (LDOEI) (Long and Summers,1979) that satisfy the two conditions in (4).
It canbe seen that the overlap between manually compileddictionaries are quite low, reflecting the fact that dif-ferent lexicographers may have quite different opin-ion about which phrases are non-compositional.Precision Recall Parser ErrorsAppendix A 15 .7% 13.7% 9.7%LDOEI 39.4% 20.9% N.A.Table 4: Evaluation ResultsThe collocations in Appendix A are classified intothree categories.
The ones marked with '+' signare found in NTC-EID.
The ones marked with 'x 'are parsing errors (we retrieved from the parsed cor-pus all the sentences that contain the collocations inAppendix A and determine which collocations areparser errors).
The unmarked collocations atisfythe condition (3) but are not found in NTC-EID.Many of the unmarked collocation are clearly id-ioms, such as "take (the) Fifth Amendment" and"take (its) toll", suggesting that even the most com-prehensive dictionaries may have many gaps in theircoverage.
The method proposed in this paper canbe used to improve the coverage manually createdlexical resources.Most of the parser errors are due to the incom-pleteness of the lexicon used by the parser.
For ex-ample, "opt" is not listed in the lexicon as a verb.The lexical analyzer guessed it as a noun, causingthe erroneous collocation "(to) do opt".
The col-location "trig lock" should be "trigger lock".
Thelexical analyzer in the parser analyzed "trigger" asthe -er form of the adjective "trig" (meaning well-groomed).Duplications in the corpus can amplify the effectof a single mistake.
For example, the following dis-claimer occurred 212 times in the corpus.
"Annualized average rate of return after ex-penses for the past 30 days: not a forecastof future returns"The parser analyzed '% forecast of future returns"as \[S \[NP a forecast of future\] \[VP returns\]\].
As aresult, ( return V:subj :N forecast)  satisfied thecondition (3).Duplications can also skew the mutual informa-tion of correct dependency relationships.
For ex-ample, the verb-object relationship between "take"and "bride" passed the mutual information filter be-cause there are 4 copies of the article containing thisphrase.
If we were able to throw away the duplicatesand record only one count of "take-bride", it wouldhave not pass the mutual information filter (3).320The fact that systematic parser errors tend topass the mutual information filter is both a curseand a blessing.
On the negative side, there isno obvious way to separate the parser errors fromtrue non-compositional expressions.
On the positiveside, the output of the mutual information filter hasmuch higher concentration of parser errors than thedatabase that contains millions of collocations.
Bymanually sifting through the output, one can con-struct a list of frequent parser errors, which can thenbe incorporated into the parser so that it can avoidmaking these mistakes in the future.
Manually go-ing through the output is not unreasonable, becauseeach non-compositional expression has to be individ-ually dealt with in a lexicon anyway.To find out the benefit of using the dependencyrelationships identified by a parser instead of simpleco-occurrence r lationships between words, we alsocreated a database of the co-occurrence r lationshipbetween part-of-speech tagged words.
We aggre-gated all word pairs that occurred within a 4-wordwindow of each other.
The same algorithm and simi-larity measure for the dependency database are usedto construct a thesaurus using the co-occurrencedatabase.
Appendix B shows all the word pairs thatsatisfies the condition (3) and that involve one ofthe 10 words {have, company, make, do, take, path,lock, resort, column, gulf}.
It is clear that AppendixB contains far fewer true non-compositional phrasesthan Appendix A.7 Re la ted  WorkThere have been numerous previous research on ex-tracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Choueka,1988) and (Smadja, 1993).
They do not, however,make a distinction between compositional nd non-compositional collocations.
Mutual information hasoften been used to separate systematic associationsfrom accidental ones.
It was also used to computethe distributional similarity between words CHin -dle, 1990; Lin, 1998).
A method to determine thecompositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in(Tapanainen et al, 1998).
The basic idea in thereis that "if an object appears only with one verb (offew verbs) in a large corpus we expect hat it has anidiomatic nature" (Tapanainen et al, 1998, p.1290).For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al, 1998)computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rankthe non-compositionality of o according to this value.Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o)is computed as follows:DF(o) = ~ Iv,, v:compl:~, ol an bi=1where {vl,v2,... ,vn} are verbs in the corpus thattook o as the object and where a and b are constants.The first column in Table 5 lists the top 40 verb-object pairs in (Tapanainen et ai., 1998).
The "mi"column show the result of our mutual informationfilter.
The '+'  sign means that the verb-object pairis also consider to be non-compositional accordingto mutual information filter (3).
The '-' sign meansthat the verb-object pair is present in our depen-dency database, but it does not satisfy condition (3).For each '-' marked pairs, the "similar collocation"column provides a similar collocation with a similarmutual information value (i.e., the reason why thepair is not consider to be non-compositional).
The'<>' marked pairs are not found in our collocationdatabase for various reasons.
For example, "finishseventh" is not found because "seventh" is normal-ized as "_NUM", "have a go" is not found because"a go" is not an entry in our lexicon, and "take ad-vantage" is not found because "take advantage of"is treated as a single lexical item by our parser.
The~/marks in the "ntc" column in Table 5 indicatethat the corresponding verb-object pairs is an idiomin (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993).
It can be seenthat none of the verb-object pairs in Table 5 thatare filtered out by condition (3) is listed as an idiomin NTC-EID.8 Conc lus ionWe have presented a method to identify non-compositional phrases.
The method is based on theassumption that non-compositionai phrases have asignificantly different mutual information value thanthe phrases that are similar to their literal mean-ings.
Our experiment shows that this hypothesis igenerally true.
However, many collocations resultedfrom systematic parser errors also tend to posses thisproperty.AcknowledgementsThe author wishes to thank ACL reviewers fortheir helpful comments and suggestions.
