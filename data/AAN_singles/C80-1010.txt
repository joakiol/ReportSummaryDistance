Moreover,  somes t ra teg ies  appear to be languagespec i f i c ,  wh i le  o thers  are languageindependent .
The term "perceptua l "  i ssomewhat inappropr ia te  in th i s  contexts ince  the processes invo lved  typ ica l lydo not re fer  to percept ion  in even i t smost genera l  sense.
The more apt term"cogn i t ive"  w i l l  be used throughout  th i spaper.In order  to es tab l i sh  the v iab i l i tyand re la t ive  importance of  var iouss t ra teg ies ,  both s implex  and complexsentences have been invest igatedexper imenta l ly .

Moreover,w i th in  a re la t ive  c lause  conta in ing  at rans i t ive  verb,  the re la t ive  pronourcan i t se l f  be sub jec t  or ob jec t .
Forsuch sentence types,  the fo l low ing  fours t ruc tures  are permi t ted ,  assuming as ing le  re la t ive  c lause  per sentence:SSa: NP\[RP V NP\] V NPThe man that  chased the dog saw theboy.SOa: NP \[RP NP V\] V NPThe man that  the dog chased saw theboy.OSa: NP V NP\[RP V N P\]The man saw the boy that  chased thedog.OOa: NP V NP\[RP NP V\]The man saw the boy that  the dogchased.In the cod ing to the le f t  of  eachs t ructure ,  the f i r s t  le t te r  representsthe grammatical  ro le  ( sub jec t  or ob jec t )of  the NP on which the re la t ive  c lausei s  formed, wh i le  the second le t te rrepresents  the grammatical  ro le  p layedby the re la t ive  pronoun.
The th i rdle t te r  represents  the fact  that  there la t ive  c lause  i s  in the ac t ive  vo ice .A para l le l  set  of  s t ruc tures  can beconst ructed  in which the re la t ive  c lauseis  in the pass ive  vo ice .

eThe Para l le l  Funct ion  s t ra tegy  wasin i t ia l l y  proposed 8 to account fo rEng l i sh  acqu is i t ion  data,  a \ ] thouqh i twas la ter  found 9 to be far  lessoperat ive  for  adu l ts .
There are twcfundamental  problems assoc ia ted  w i thth i s  s t ra tegy .
The f i r s t  is  that  i t  isnot c lear  whether para l le l  funct ion  isto be de f ined  on under ly ing  or sur facegrammatical  ro les .
In the pass ivesl i s ted  above, sur face  grammatical  ro lesare ind icated  for  a l l  NPs, inc lud ingre la t ive  pronouns.
However, each ofthose cou ld  a l so  be in terpreted  inunder ly ing  terms.
For example, there la t ive  pronoun is  const rued  as sub jec tin type SSp, a l though in deep s t ructureterms i t  is  the ob jec t .
Consequent ly ,two d is t inc t  vers ions  of  the s t ra tegyare poss ib le ,  one based on sur facegrammatical  re la t ions  and the o therbased on under ly ing  re la t ions .
Bothvers ions  are tes ted  here.
The secondproblem is  conceptua l  in nature ,  Inpar t i cu la r ,  the s t ra tegy  seems to lackany exp lanatory  power, s tand ing  on ly  asan i so la ted  statement  of  cer ta inresu l t s ,  w i thout  independent mot ivat ion .In fac t ,  even i t s  re levance  for  theacqu is i t ion  data has been cha l lenged.
7Both the Word Order andIn ter rupt ion  s t ra teg ies  were proposed 1?to deal w i th  language acqu is i t ionphenomena, but both can read i ly  bet rans la ted  in to  process ing  terms, asthey have been here.
C lear ly ,  ne i theris  language spec i f i c ,  a l though the WordOrder s t ra tegy  assumes the ex is tence  ofa "bas ic"  or "normal"  word order ,usua l ly  assumed to be that  of  thes imple ,  dec la ra t ive ,  a f f i rmat ivesentence.
On qu i te  independent grounds,Givon 4 has argued that  the s imple ,dec la ra t ive ,  a f f i rmat ive  sentence typeis  the most bas ic  in many, i f  not a l l ,languages prec ise ly  because i t  i sp resuppos i t iona l ly  the least  burdenedtype.
The Word Order s t ra tegy  pred ic tsthat  any c lause  which dev ia tes  from thenormal form wi l l  be more d i f f i cu l t  toprocess than one which does not .
TheIn ter rupt ion  s t ra tegy  pred ic ts  that  anysentence w i th  an in terna l ly  embedded( in ter rupt ing)  c lause  w i l l  be mored i f f i cu l t  to process than one w i th  anembedded c lause  at one ext remi ty  or theo ther ,Sheldon e noted that  the Adjacencys t ra tegy  i s  bas ica l ly  an Eng l i sh  pars ingdev ice  which app l ies  b l ind ly  across asentence from le f t  to r ight ,  ass ign ing  asur face  grammatical  ro le  to each fu l l  NPi t  encounters ,  and leav ing  re la t ivepronouns unanalyzed.
She po in ted  outthat  the s t ra tegy  sometimes fa i l s  toass ign  grammatical  ro les  cor rect ly .
Forexample, in  an SSa sentence l i ke  "The61man that  chased the dog saw the boy,the s t ra tegy  ass igns  The man as sub jec tof  chased and the doq as ob jec t .
I tthen sk ips  over that  and incor rect lyass igns  the doq as sub jec t  of  saw, andf ina \ ] \ ]y  spec i f ies  the boy as ob jec t .Thus, the Adjacency s t ra tegy  makes oneer ror  for  type SSa.
She\]don 9 suggeststhat  the number of  e r rors  made by thes t ra tegy  determines  the re la t iveprocess ing  d i f f i cu l ty  of  that  type ofs t ruc ture .Each s t ra tegy  generates  pred ic t ionsas to the ease of  p rocess ing  o f  thee ight  sentence types.

ENGLISH NATURALNESS dUDGEMENTSThe Eng l i sh  ExperimentIn order  to tes t  the pred ic t ions ,  as ing le  exper iment  was conducted us ing  ass t imu l i  56 sentences in wr i t ten  form,w i th  seven separate  tokens( rep l i ca t ions)  of  each of  the e ighttypes.

To unravel62 -th i s  complex i ssue,  i t  is  ins t ruct ive  toexamine severa l  fac tors  assoc ia ted  w i ththe act ive /pass ive  d i s t inc t ion .
Wi th inan act ive  c lause ,  the sub jec t  of  at rans i t ive  ac t ion  verb i s  typ ica l ly ,a l though not a lways,  in terpretab le  as asemantic  agent,  wh i le  for  the pass ive ,i t  i s  cer ta in  that  the sub jec t  i s  not anagent.
In fac t ,  Givon 4 has suggestedthat  an impor tant  funct ion  of  thepass ive  const ruct ion  is  to p lace anon-agent  NP in to  sub jec t  pos i t ion .
Apass ive  c lause  there fore  dev ia tes  fromthe "normal" case of  sub jec t  as semant icagent.
Consequent ly ,  wh i le  both ac t iveand pass ive  c lauses  can be character i zedas hav ing a sur face  SVO word order ,  thesub jec t  of  the pass ive  i s  non-agent ,  andthe ob jec t  is  the ob jec t  of  theprepos i t ion  .b_~.Another impor tant  d i f fe rence  i sthat  pass ives  are far  less  f requent  thanact ives .
In d i scuss ing  text  counts  madeover a broad spectrum of  genres,  Givon 4repor ted  that  some 90% of thea f f i rmat ive ,  dec la ra t ive  sentences wereact ives ,  and on ly  10% were pass ives .Furthermore,  on ly  20% of  the la t te r  were" fu l l "  pass ives  w i th  over t  agent ive  b~phrases ,  wh i le  80% were t runcatedpass ives .
Accord ing ly ,  on ly  2% ofa f f i rmat ive ,  dec la ra t ive  sentences are" fu l l "  pass ives .
Givon 4 suggested thespec ia l  d i scourse  proper t ies  andpresuppos i t ions  assoc ia ted  w i th  thepass ive  might account for  the i r  lowf requency .
For example, the sub jec t  o fa pass ive  c lause  i s  not a potent ia lagent,  but i s  more typ ica l ly  a semant icpat ient .
However, the sub jec ts  ofdec la ra t ive  sentences tend to conta inGiven in fo rmat ion ,  w i th  the ob jec ts  morel i ke ly  to be New.
This  fo l lows  from theGiven-New s t ra tegy ,  2 accord ing  to whichGiven in fo rmat ion  normal ly  precedes Newin  a sentence.
Some 90% of  the sub jec tNPs in ac t ive  sentences are de f in i te ,wh i le  93% of  the sub jec t  NPs of  pass ivesentences are de f in i te .
4 In genera l ,then,  the sub jec ts  of  both ac t ive  andpass ive  sentences tend to be de f in i teand Given.
In ac t ive  sentences,however, on ly  about 56% of  the d i rec tob jec t  NPs are de f in i te ,  and the d i rec tob jec t  i s  fa r  more l i ke ly  to conta in  Newin format ion  than is  the sub jec t .S imi la r ly ,  i f  there  i s  an over t  ob jec t(agent ive)  phrase in  a pass ive ,  i t  i salmost invar iab ly  New in format ion .Based on these observat ions ,  we canext ract  the fo l low ing  genera l  fac tsconcern ing  the d i s t inc t ion  betweenact ive  and pass ive  c lauses .
Act ives  aremore f requent ,  have sub jec t  as anent ,and ob jec t  as pat ient ,  Furthermore,  thesub jec t  of an ac t ive  is  typ ica l lyde f in i te  and Given, wh i le  the ob jec t  isless  l i ke ly  to be de f in i te  and morel i ke ly  to be New in format ion ,  Thepass ive ,  on the o ther  hand, has ade f in i te ,  non-agent ive ,  typ ica l ly  Givensub jec t  and i f  i t  has an ob jec t  at a l l ,the ob jec t  is  agent,  typ ica l ly  de f in i te ,and New.
The d i f fe rences  are c lear lys igna l led  by the word order  andmorpho log ica l  fac tors  assoc ia ted  w i ththe pass ive .
Consequent ly ,  i t  wouldappear that  the g loba l  character i s t i c  ofvo ice  has assoc ia ted  w i th  i t  a host  ofsyntact i c ,  semant ic ,  and d iscourseproper t ies ,  w i th  the pass ive  being byfar  the more "marked" and less  expectedform.Once the two groups have beenseparated by vo ice ,  we can examine thefac tors  w i th in  each group which g iver i se  to fu r ther  subgroup ings .
Wi th inthe act ives ,  the In ter rupt ion  s t ra tegyseparates  the four  groups in to  two,demonst ra t ing  that  comprehension i s  mored i f f i cu l t  when a re la t ive  c lausein ter rupts  the main c lause .
Wi th in  thepass ives ,  Word Order was the on lys ign i f i cant  fac tor :  a pass ive  re la t ivec lause  w i th  SVO word order  was judgedeas ie r  to comprehend than one w i th  anOSV word order .
In ter rupt ion  p layed noro le  among the subgroup ings  of  thepass ives .The exper iment  demonstrated theimportance of  In ter rupt ion  and WordOrder,  wh i le  ne i ther  vers ion  of  Para l le lFunct ion  nor Adjacency emerged ass ign i f i cant .
However, the two operat ives t ra teg ies  are not equa l ly  sa l ient ,  andin par t i cu la r ,  i t  appears thatIn ter rupt ion  i s  impor tant  on ly  for  theac t ive  s t ructures ,  in  which the normalexpectat ion  of  sub jec t  as agent is  met.For the non-normal (pass ive~ cases, WordOrder i s  very  impor tant .
Consequent ly ,i t  appears that  Word Order must besat i s f ied  before  In ter rupt ion  can beca l led  in to  p lay .At th i s  po in t ,  something fu r thermust be sa id  about the consequences ofthe Given-New s t ra tegy  w i th in  re la t ivec lauses .
Since i t  has an antecedent ,  are la t ive  pronoun typ ica l ly  representsGiven in fo rmat ion .
Consequent ly ,  in are .
\ ]a t ive  c lause  w i th  the s t ructure  \[RP VNP\], the re la t ive  pronoun is  sub jec t  andi s  in the pos i t ion  assoc ia ted  w i th  Givenin fo rmat ion .
For re la t ive  c lauses t ructures  of  the form \[RP NP V\], there la t ive  pronoun is  again the f i r s t  NPin  the c lause ,  and sat i s f ies  the Given63pos i t ion .
Furthermore,  i t  is  jus t  th i sGiven RP which can be success fu l lyde le ted .
However, the sub jec t  NP, whichis  a l so  typ ica l ly  Given in fo rmat ion ,  nowf inds  i t se l f  in the New pos i t ion ,accord ing  to the Given-New s t ra tegy .Consequent ly ,  th i s  type of re la t ivec lause  s t ructure ,  w i th  word order  OSV,might be expected to be somewhat lessnatura l  in terms of  the Given-News t ra tegy ,  than the former,  w i th  the wordorder  SVO.
No such significantd i f fe rence  was found in these data,a l though such a resu l t  was repor ted  byLynkowsky, 6 who conducted a s imi la rexper iment ,  but used on ly  ac t ivere la t ive  c lauses .
In her exper iment ,there  was no dev ia t ion  from theexpected,  normal case of  sub jec t  aspotent ia l  agent,  and consequent ly  i twould be expected that  the dominant WordOrder s t ra tegy  would be the f i r s ts t ra tegy  to be ca l led  in to  operat ion .Wi th in  the pass ive  group,  the i ssueis  somewhat more complex.
The pass ivere la t ive  c lauses  can have one of  twoforms, e i ther  \[RP be Ved by NP\], w i ththe word order  of  SVO, or \[RP NP be Vedby \ ] ,  w i th  an OSV word order .
In bothcases, the normal expectat ion  of  sub jec tas agent is  v io la ted .
The resu l ts  ofthe exper iment  ind icate  that  i t  i s  theformer,  SVO,  pass ives  which are judgedfar  more natura l  than the la t te r ,  OSVs t ructures .
In terms of  the Given-News t ra tegy ,  th i s  makes a great  deal ofsense.
In the SVO case, the re la t iveproqoun appears to be Given for  tworeasons:  i t  i s  a sub jec t  and i t  is  are la t ive  pronoun.
The agent ive  NPob jec t  is  p rec ise ly  where Newin format ion  should be.
In the OSV case,however, the re la t ive  pronoun should  beGiven s ince  i t  is  a re la t ive  pronoun,but i t  should be New s ince  i t  is  theob jec t  of  the prepos i t ion  ..~.Furthermore,  the sub jec t  NP is  in  theNew pos i t ion ,  but as sub jec t  i t  shouldbe Given.
Consequent ly ,  the Given-News t ra tegy  seems to be work ing  aga ins ti t se l f  in  the pass ive  re la t ive  c lausesw i th  OSV word order ,One f ina l  aspect of  the Given-Newfac tor  must a l so  be ment ioned.Typ ica l ly ,  de f in i te  NPs are const rued  asGiven in fo rmat ion .
In the s t imu l i  fo rthe present  exper iment ,  however, a11 NPswere de f in i te .
I f  a re la t ive  c lause  i sformed on a de f in i te  NP, there  may be atendency to view the re la t ive  c lause  asadding to the de f in i teness  orspec i f i c i ty  of  the NP, thereby making i teven more "G iven , "  regard less  of  wherei t  i s  p laced in the sentence.Consequent ly ,  w i th in  the act ive  group,the Given-New s t ra tegy  might be viewedas a " fo rce  ''3 favor ing  s t ructures  w i ththe re la t ive  c lauses  on the sub jec t  NP,wh i le  In ter rupt ion  would be a fo rcefavor ing  s t ructures  w i th  re la t ivec lauses  on ob jec t  NPs.
Accord ing ly ,these two forces  are in compet i t ionw i th in  the act ives .
In the pass ivegroup, however, the Word Order s t ra tegyfavors  re la t ive  c lauses  of  the form SVO,and the Given-New s t ra tegy  a l so  favorssuch s t ructures .
Here, the twos t ra teg ies  work together .The Japanese ExperimentAt th i s  po in t ,  b r ie f  ment ion w i l lbe made of  a Japanese exper iment  s imi la rto the one repor ted  above, but focus ingon ly  on act ive  re la t ive  c lauses ,  Thesame methodology was employed, w i th  24nat ive  speakers of  Japanese serv ing  assub jec ts .

Furthermore,Japanese re la t ive  c lauses  do not conta inre la t ive  pronouns,  but ra ther  exh ib i tde le t ion  of  the re \ ]a t iv i zed  NP.

In add i t ion ,  and perhapsmost impor tant ly ,  the Given-New s t ra tegywas found to be of  extreme importance,both for  Eng l i sh  and for  Japanese.F ina l ly ,  a h ie rarchy  of  s t ra teg ies  hassuggested i t se l f .
