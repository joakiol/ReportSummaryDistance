Our system disambiguatessenses of Chinese words and finds thecorrect translation in English by using theweb as WSD knowledge source.
Since allthe statistic data is obtained from searchengine, the method is considered to beunsupervised and does not require anysense-tagged corpus.1 IntroductionDue to the lack of sense tagged corpora (and thedifficulty of manually creating them), theunsupervised method tries to avoid, or at least toreduce, the knowledge acquisition problem, whichthe supervised methods have to deal with.
In orderto tackle the problem of the knowledge acquisitionbottleneck, we adopted an unsupervised approachbased on search engine, which does not require anysense tagged corpus.The majority of methods using the Web often tryto automatically generate sense tagged corpora(Agirre and Martinez 2000;Agirre and Martinez2004;Gonzalo et al 2003; Mihalcea and Moldovan1999;Santamaria et al 2003).
In this paper, weexperiment with our initial attempt on anotherresearch trend that uses the Web not for extractingtraining samples but helping disambiguate directlyduring the translation selection process.The approach we present here is inspired by(Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rossoet al 2005; Dagan et al 2006; McCarthy 2002).Suppose that source ambiguous words are apt toappear with its target translation on bilingual webpages either parallel or non-parallel.
Instead ofsearching the source language or target languagerespectively on web, we try to let the search enginethink in a bilingual style.
First, our system gets theco-occurrence information of Chinese context andits corresponding English context.
Then it computesassociation measurements of Chinese context andEnglish context in 4 kinds of way.
Finally, itselects the correct English translation bycomputing the association measurements.In view that this is the first international standardevaluation to predict the correct English translationfor ambiguous Chinese word, we built HIT-WSDsystem as our first attempt on disambiguation by usingbilingual web search and just want to testify validityof our method.2 HIT-WSD System2.1 Disambiguation ProcessHIT-WSD system disambiguates senses of Chinesetarget ambiguous word and finds the correcttranslation in English by searching bilingualinformation on the web.
Figure 1 gives theflowchart of our proposed approach.
Given anambiguous word with a Chinese sentence, weeasily create its Chinese context.
English contextcan be acquired from a Chinese-English dictionary andthe translation mapping set(offered by theMultilingual Chinese-English Lexical SampleTask).
System puts Chinese context and Englishcontext as queries on search engine individuallyand collectively.
After this step, frequency and co-occurrence frequency of Chinese context and English169context will be found.
Finally, our system selects themost probable English translation by computingassociation measurements.Figure 2 gives an example of how the proposedapproach selects English translations of theChinese ambiguous word ???/dongyao?
giventhe sentence and its translation mapping set.
Thisinstance comes from the training data of Multilin-gual Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of Sem-eval2007.
According to the translation mapping set,Chinese target word ???
/dongyao?
has twoEnglish Translations: shake and vacillate.English Context Candidates set is thetranslations set of the Chinese context.
System usestranslation mapping set to translate Chinese targetambiguous word and uses an Chinese-Englishdictionary to translate other words in Chinesecontext.
English Context Candidates set could beany combination of translations and eachcombination could be selected as the English context.After getting the Chinese context and Englishcontext, we put them as queries to search engineand extract page counts (which can be consideredas frequency) which search engine returned.
Wenot only search Chinese context and Englishcontext individually, but also put them together tosearch engine.Association measurements: the Dice coefficient,point-wise mutual information, Log Likelihoodscore and?
P2 P score are computed in the third phasewhile we got all kinds of statistic results fromsearch engine.
Finally, we determine thetranslation by simply computing the associationmeasurementsFigure 2: Example of the Chinese ambiguous word???/dongyao?

The sentencesegment is a window size ?
n segment of thesentence including the ambiguous words.English Context Candidates set could be anycombination of the translation of words appearingin Chinese context.
In our experiment system, wejust choose the translation of the Chinese targetambiguous words in the translation mapping set asEnglish context.We choose googleTP 1 PT and baiduTP 2 PT as our searchengine, for they are both most widely used forEnglish and Chinese language respectively.Putting Chinese context and English context asqueries to the search engine, we will getcorresponding page counts it returned as figure 2shows.Four statistical measurements were used in orderto measure the degree of association of ChineseContext (CC) and English Context (EC).

Allthese ambiguous words are either nouns or verbs.Test data consist of 935 untagged instances of thesame target words.The official result of our system in multilingualChinese-English lexical sample task is reported asin Table 2.Precision( Micro-average)Context Window SizeAssociation-1,+1 -1,+2 -2,+2MI(Baidu) 0.349 0.349 0.339XX(Baidu) 0.338 0.344 0.314LL(Baidu) 0.315 0.320 0.293DICE(Baidu) 0.285 0.295 0.295MI(google) 0.334 0.334 0.339XX(google) 0.322 0.316 0.316LL(google) 0.295 0.306 0.299DICE(google) 0.281 0.278 0.272(4)Measurements1714 ConclusionsIn SemEval-2007, we participated in MultilingualChinese-English Lexical Sample Task with a fullyunsupervised system based on bilingual web search.Our initial experiment result shows that our systemfails to reach MFS (Most Familiar Sense) baselinedue to our method is too simple where searchqueries are formed (just uses simple contextwindow and English target translation).
Ourapproach is the first attempt so far as we know onusing bilingual web search for translation selectiondirectly.
The system is very simple but seemed toachieve a not bad performance when consideredthe performance of fully unsupervised systems inSENSEVAL-2, SENSEVAL -3 English tasks.For future research, we will investigate thedependency of bilingual documents, optimize thesearch queries, filter out potential noises andcombine the different results in order to devise animproved method that can utilize bilingual websearch better.ReferencesAgirre, E.and Martinez, D. 2000.
