In particular, for the current phase, the message collectionbelongs to the domain of terrorist activities.
On the one hand, a decision as to the relevance o fa message to a specified class of terrorist events should be made .
If relevant, a predefined set offacts are to be extracted and placed as fills for appropriate slots of the template(s) created for thismessage .
If not relevant, a template having a'*' as the fill in all but one slot, is created (see AppendixA for details) .
Some aspects of the MUC-3 task are amenable to be solved by techniques typicallyemployed in information retrieval (IR) .
These techniques are especially designed to be applicable t oany domain.
In contrast, there are other aspects of the problem that may require a great deal oflanguage understanding, thus needing natural language processing (NLP) techniques .
For the mostpart, NLP techniques may be considered domain dependent .The primary thrust of our effort has been to design and implement a system that employstechniques typically found in m literature, augmented by basic search techniques available in fil emanagement systems.
An important goal (for the time being) is to ensure that the system is domai nindependent to the greatest extent possible .
Consequently, certain slots which are not suitable,t obe handled by the chosen techniques are not filled ..In the context of the MUC-3 task, slots fall into one of four categories depending on the typ eof fill that are applicable to them .
Our system is designed to handle slots whose values are from aset-list .
More specifically we process TYPE OF INCIDENT, CATEGORY OF INCIDENT, PERPETRATOR :CONFIDENCE, PHYSICAL TARGET TYPE, HUMAN TARGET TYPE, INSTRUMENT : TYPE(S), EFFEC TON PHYSICAL TARGET(S) and EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S) .
In addition, two slots whose fill sare of string type are also processed .
These are PERPETRATOR : ID OF ORG(S) and LOCATION O FINCIDENT .As will be explained later, the system consists of an Indexing Module, a Learning Module, aFiltering Module, and a Template Filler Module .
We had developed and experimentally validatedindexing and learning techniques for use in the context of information retrieval and classification .These techniques were adapted to develop the indexing and learning modules for MUC-3 in addition234to the development and implementation of other modules .
This site did not participate in eithe rMUC-1 or MUC-2 .OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEMA popular strategy in IR is to formulate the problem of identifying items relevant to a subject area asone of conceptual categorization .
The subject area(s) of interest is imagined as a concept or a class .Example items relevant to a certain concept are assumed to be given .
Based on this informatio nand using techniques for learning from examples, a concept characterization rule, that is optimal i na certain precise sense, is derived .
In other words, retrieval of relevant items is actually viewed as a"recognition" problem .Our system employs the above idea by mapping possible fill values of set-list type slots to concept sof interest.
For example, in the context of the TYPE OF INCIDENT slot, fill values such as ARSON ,MURDER, BOMBING, etc .
are the concepts to be learned .
Note that the question of whether conceptARSON is applicable to a message is equivalent to deciding whether a message belongs to the messag eclass identified by the label ARSON .
Thus, the template filling task and the decision of whether amessage is relevant to MUC-3 task are investigated as problems requiring conceptual categorization .For each concept that is considered by the system to be applicable to a message, the system als okeeps track of the extent to which each of the paragraphs in the message contributed to this decision .Judicious use of this information enables various important activities such as the resolution of the"best" fill for a slot from among alternatives, the linking of the fills to templates when more tha none template must be generated for the same message, and the filling of the two string type slots .The general architecture of the system is presented in Figure 1 .
There are four major subsystems :Indexing Module, Learning Module, Filtering Module, and Template Filler Module .
Each of thesesystems are outlined next .Indexing Modul eThe function of the Indexing Module is to generate a representation for each message .
A messageis represented by a vector of weights .
Each weight value either indicates the presence or absence o fa term in the message or the importance of a term to the message .
A term is either a single-orderterm or a high-order term (i .e ., single terms or word combinations representing phrases) .For the assignment of single terms to messages, the indexing module from the SMART RetrievalSystem [1] is used.
This module utilizes a stop list to filter out the common words and the "no -stemming" option is chosen .
All terms that are assigned a weight larger than a threshold by thi smodule are retained in the message representation vector .For the purpose of phrase extraction, a modified version of the INDEX software, developed andimplemented by Jones, et al [2,3], is used .
INDEX is used mainly to extract all possible substring sthat are within certain minimum and maximum length specifications and are not substrings of othe rpreviously selected substrings .
Several strategies for filtering these to identify "good" phrases ar eprovided as a part of the software developed for the MUC-3 project .Thus, each element of the vector representing a message corresponds to either a single term o ra phrase.
The phrase identification is expected to be important as a precision improving device .This module also generates the system vocabulary, which consists of all the distinct single terms an dphrases used in representing the messages .Learning ModuleThe function of the learning module is to derive the concept categorization rules for the variou sconcepts of interest .
Each rule is a vector of numeric weights, where the elements correspond to th eterms in the system vocabulary .235sTrainin gSetMessagesIndexingModule Syste mVocabularyIndexedTrainingSetMessage sTrainingSetKeyTemplateLearningModules.
Concep tRul eVectorsTestMessageFilterin gModuleMessageRelevanc eTemplat eFillerModuleSlot fillvsParagraphRelevanceFille dTemplatesRul eBaseFigure 1: Block diagram of the system236This module also involves components for selecting a training set from the development set ,identifying the concepts for which the training set has at least a minimum number of positiv eexamples (i .e ., the learnable concepts) and preparing the grid file, which shows for each message i nthe training set which of the learnable concepts are applicable .
The source for this information isthe set of key-templates manually generated for the 1300 messages in the development set .The concept rule vectors are derived by employing the perceptron -learning algorithm [4] .
Thealgorithm is simple and efficient .
The procedure is incremental in that the rule can be updated asnew examples become available.
As long as a decision boundary exists, this algorithm is guaranteedto find one and terminate .Usually, the decision boundary constructed is a hyper-plane .
However, since the system vocab-ulary includes phrases, and phrases incorporate dependency information between single terms, ou rresult is equivalent to constructing a non-linear boundary.
In the terminology of the connectionis tnetworks, we employ a single-layer, high-order perceptron .
The single-layer option facilitates fastlearning time, while the higher-order option enables the use of more powerful separation bound-aries .
Furthermore, the concept rule vectors are connectionist, rather than symbolic in nature .
Suchrules are more attractive when a large number of features are involved and when robustness agains tnoisyness in features is crucial .In addition to concepts associated with slot fills, another concept known as "optimal-query "is also derived .
This rule vector distinguishes messages that are not relevant to Muc-3 task fromthose that generate at least one template.
The system is set up in such a way that the trainingset of messages for deriving this optimal-query vector can be different from that used for the othe rconcepts.Filtering moduleThe Filtering Module is responsible for identifying concepts applicable to a set of test messages anddeciding whether a message is relevant to the MuC-3 task.
The major subsystems of this modul eare concerned with test message indexing, assessment of concept relevance and the evaluation of arule base by means of an inference engine .The test message indexing involves the determination of which of the single terms and phrase sin the system vocabulary are contained in the message .
This process generates a message vectorthat is matched against each of the concept rule vectors to determine the corresponding activatio nvalues .
The distribution of the activation values for the test set of messages relative to each concept i sanalyzed to determine a threshold .
A concept is considered relevant to a message if the correspondin gactivation value exceeds the threshold chosen for that concept .
Depending on the concepts applicabl eto a message, the inference engine activates appropriate rules of the rule base, whose terminal symbol scorrespond to the various concepts acquired.
The rule base expresses the requirements in terms o fconcept combinations that, when present in a message, imply that the message is relevant to Muc- 3task.
The module also identifies for each message, the extent to which its paragraphs contribute dto the activation values relative to the different concepts .
This result is referred to as the concep tvs.
paragraph relevance vector .For slots of string fill type, a database of possible fill values, grouped by slot name, is provide das input to this module .
For each string in the database for which at least one match is found i nthe message, the paragraphs in which a match is found and the frequency of its occurrence in eachparagraph is determined .Template Filler Modul eThis module is responsible for generating one or more templates for each message determined to b erelevant by the Filtering Module and filling the slots on the basis of concepts and string filled tha tare activated .For each relevant message either the optimal-query concept is activated or one or more inciden ttypes are recognized along with a desired combination of concepts (or both) .
In the case exactly oneincident type is recognized, for each of the other slots the following is performed .
If several concepts237are activated for this slot and only one value is permitted, the one with highest activation value i schosen; otherwise, all values are filled .In the case more than one incident type is activated, the system must decide, for each activate dconcept, to which incident type it is the closest .
For this purpose, the concept versus paragraphrelevance vector is used .
This vector contains the contribution of the various paragraphs in a messag eto the activation value of the slot fill relative to this message .
The paragraph relevance vector of anactivated slot fill, say CIVILIAN (from HUMAN TARGET TYPE), is compared to the vector associatedwith each of the activated incident types, say KIDNAPPING and MURDER.
The strength of this matchis then used to decide whether the fill CIVILIAN will be used in the KIDNAPPING or the MURDERtemplate .If a message becomes relevant only due to optimal-query, then it enables other slots havingactivated fills to be filled even though no TYPE OF INCIDENT may have been activated .SYSTEM WALKTHROUG HThe system walkthrough explains how the message TsT1-MUC3-0099 is processed .
The result ob-tained corresponds to the parameter settings used in our Option 4 (see report on UNL/USL : Muc-3Test Results and Analysis) .
In this option, Training Set 2 is used for determining the rule vector fo roptimal-query and Training Set 3 is used for the other concepts .
The threshold used for decidingwhether a concept is activated is based on an analysis of the distribution of the activation values ofthis concept relative to the test set messages (threshold setting T1) .Table 1 shows a list of all set-list type fills and those that are actually learnable on the basis oftraining set 3 .
The concept rule vectors for each of these fills are constructed by using the indexin gand the learning module .
The test message is indexed and the dot product of its representation vecto rwith each of the concept rule vectors is computed .
The activation values so obtained are compare dto the corresponding threshold values .
Table 2 shows that, for the current message, the following fiveconcepts are activated : BOMBING, TERRORIST ACT, TRANSPORT VEHICLE, SOME DAMAGE, and theoptimal-query.
These concepts activate the appropriate leaf nodes of the AND/OR tree associatedwith the rulebase shown in Table 4.
This results in the root node getting the value "true" an dtherefore, this message is termed relevant .
For the current testing, the rule base is defined withall the concept weights being either 0 or 1 .
The inference engine is, however, capable of handlin gany numeric weights between 0 and 1 .
The vector representation for each of the paragraphs in themessage are also multiplied by the concept rule vectors to obtain the paragraph vs concept relevanc evector (Table 3) .
This paragraph information is not useful in this case since neither several fillsare activated for a slot for which only one fill is permitted nor is there an indication, in terms o fINCIDENT TYPE activations, that multiple templates should be created .For the two string fill slots the matching strings along with their occurrence frequency in th evarious paragraphs is shown in Table 5 .
The paragraph vector for BOMBING is found to match theparagraph vector of "POLICE" better (wrong decision!)
.
All 3 incident locations have a positiv eactivation value with BOMBING.
Since the location slot permits multiple fills, all three may beretained .
However, since "PRC" is not one of the South American countries, it is discarded .The filled template for this message is shown in Table 6 .
This template most closely matches key-template that is numbered 2 (see Appendix H) .
The paragraph relevance vector matching techniqueneeds to be refined as evidenced by the choice of "POLICE" as the perpetrator organization .
Further-more, template filler module should be refined to automatically determine and incorporate in th efilling process various dependencies between template fills .
For example, "POLICE " is inconsistentwith CATEGORY OF INCIDENT being TERRORIST ACT.By proper modification of the stop list used during phrase extraction, phrases such as NO INJURYcould be extracted .
The optimal-query vector identifies relevant passages fairly accurately .
Carefu ldetailed analysis of individual instances should lead to many ideas for improvement .238Concept CID Concept Name Output fileconceptl 1 ARSON slot-3concept2 2 ARSON THREAT slot-3concept3 3 ../ MURDER slot-concept4 4 .~/ DEATH THREAT slot-concept5 5 ,/ BOMBING slot-concept8 8 BOMB THREAT slot-concept?
