Proceedings of the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 308?317,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 26-30 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsClassifying Temporal Relations with Simple FeaturesParamita MirzaFondazione Bruno Kesslerand University of TrentoTrento, Italyparamita@fbk.euSara TonelliFondazione Bruno KesslerTrento, Italysatonelli@fbk.euAbstractApproaching temporal link labelling as aclassification task has already been ex-plored in several works.
However, choos-ing the right feature vectors to build theclassification model is still an open is-sue, especially for event-event classifica-tion, whose accuracy is still under 50%.We find that using a simple feature set re-sults in a better performance than usingmore sophisticated features based on se-mantic role labelling and deep semanticparsing.
We also investigate the impact ofextracting new training instances using in-verse relations and transitive closure, andgain insight into the impact of this boot-strapping methodology on classifying thefull set of TempEval-3 relations.1 IntroductionIn recent years, temporal processing has gained in-creasing attention within the NLP community, inparticular since TempEval evaluation campaignshave been organized on this topic (Verhagen etal., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al.,2013).
In particular, the classification of tem-poral relations holding between entities such asevents and temporal expressions (timex) is crucialto build event timelines and to reconstruct the plotof a story.
This could be exploited in decision sup-port systems and document archiving applications,among others.In this work we focus on the problem of clas-sifying temporal relation types, assuming that thelinks between events and time expressions are al-ready established.
This task is part of Tempeval-3evaluation campaign, hence we follow the guide-lines and the dataset provided by the organizers,so that we can compare our system with othersystems participating in the challenge.
Recentworks have tried to address this complex classifi-cation task by using sophisticated features, basedon deep parsing, semantic role labelling and dis-course parsing (D?Souza and Ng, 2013; Laokulratet al., 2013).
We argue that a simpler approach,based on lexico-syntactic features, achieves com-parable results, while reducing the processing timeneeded to extract the features.
Besides, the perfor-mance of complex NLP tools may strongly varywhen moving to new domains, affecting in turn theclassification performance, while our approach islikely to be more stable across different domains.Our features include some basic information onthe position, the attributes and the PoS tags ofevents and timexes, as well as other informationobtained from external lexical resources such as alist of typical event durations and a list of temporalsignals.
The few processing steps required includePoS-tagging, dependency parsing and the seman-tic tagging of connectives (based on the parser out-put).We also investigate the impact of extending thenumber of training instances through inverse rela-tions and transitive closure, which is a ?simplified?version of temporal closure covering only entitiesconnected via the same relation type.2 Related WorkThe task we deal with in this paper was proposedas part of the TempEval-3 shared task (UzZamanet al., 2012).
Compared to previous TempEvalcampaigns, the TempEval-3 task involved recog-nizing the full set of temporal relations in TimeML(14 types) instead of a reduced set, increasing thetask complexity.
This specific temporal relationclassification task becomes the main focus of thispaper.Supervised classification of temporal relationtypes has already been explored in some earlierworks.
Mani et al.
(2006) built a MaxEnt classi-fier to label the temporal links using training data308which were bootstrapped by applying temporalclosure.
Chambers et al.
(2007) focused on clas-sifying the temporal relation type of event-eventpairs using previously learned event attributes asfeatures.
However, both works use a reduced setof temporal relations, obtained by collapsing therelation types that inverse each other into a singletype.Our work is most similar to the recent workby D?Souza and Ng (2013).
The authors performthe same task on the full set of temporal rela-tions, but adopt a much more complex approach.They utilize lexical relations extracted from theMerriam-Webster dictionary and WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998), as well as semantic and discoursefeatures.
They also introduce 437 hand-codedrules to build a hybrid classification model.Since we conduct our experiments based onTempEval-3 task setup, this work is also compa-rable with the systems participating in the task.UzZaman et al.
(2013) report that three groupssubmitted at least one system run to the task.The best performing one (Laokulrat et al., 2013)uses, among others, sentence-level semantic in-formation from a deep syntactic parser, namelypredicate-argument structure features.
Anothersystem (Chambers, 2013) is composed of fourMaxEnt classifiers, two of which have beentrained for event-event links (inter- and intra-sentence) and two for event-time links.
The third-ranked system (Kolya et al., 2013), instead, im-plements a much simpler set of features account-ing for event tense, modality and aspect, event andtimex context, etc.3 Temporal Link LabellingIn this section we detail the task of temporal re-lation labelling, the features implemented in ourclassification system and the strategy adopted tobootstrap new training data.3.1 Task descriptionThe full set of temporal relations specified inTimeML version 1.2.1 (Saur??
et al., 2006) con-tains 14 types of relations, as illustrated in Table 1.Among them there are six pairs of relations that in-verse each other.Note that according to TimeML 1.2.1 annota-tion guidelines, the difference between DURINGand IS INCLUDED (also their inverses) is thatDURING relation is specified when an event per-sists throughout a temporal duration (e.g.
Johndrove for 5 hours), while IS INCLUDED relationis specified when an event happens within a tem-poral expression (e.g.
John arrived on Tuesday).a |??
?| a is BEFORE bb |??
?| b is AFTER aa |??
?| a is IBEFORE bb |??

?| a INCLUDES bb |?
?| b IS INCLUDED in aa |??
?|a is SIMULTANEOUS with bb |??
?|a |??
?| b a is IDENTITY with bTable 1: Temporal relations in TimeML annota-tionIn TimeML annotation, temporal links are usedto (i) establish the temporal order of two events(event-event pair), (ii) anchor an event to a timeexpression (event-timex pair) and (iii) establish thetemporal order of two time expressions (timex-timex pair).The problem of determining the label of a giventemporal link can be regarded as a classificationproblem.
Given an ordered pair of entities (e1,e2) that could be either event-event, event-timexor timex-timex pair, the classifier has to assign acertain label, namely one of the 14 temporal rela-tion types.
We train a classification model for eachcategory of entity pair, as suggested in several pre-vious works (Mani et al., 2006; Chambers, 2013).However, because there are very few examplesof timex-timex pairs in the training corpus, it is notpossible to train the classification model for theseparticular pairs.
Moreover, they only add up to3.2% of the total number of extracted entity pairs;therefore, we decided to disregard these pairs.3.2 Feature setWe implement a number of features for tempo-ral relation classification.
Some of them are ba-sic ones which take into account morpho-syntacticinformation on events and time expressions, theirtextual context and their attributes.
Others relyon semantic information such as typical event du-rations and connective type.
However, we avoidcomplex processing of data.
Such semantic infor-mation is based on external lists of lexical items309and on the output of the addDiscourse tagger(Pitler and Nenkova, 2009).Some features are computed independentlybased on either e1or e2, while some others arepairwise features, which are computed based onboth elements.
Some pairwise features are onlyrelevant for event-event pairs, for example, theinformation on discourse connectives and thebinary features representing whether two eventshave the same event attributes or not.
Similarly,the features related to time expression attributesare only relevant for event-timex pairs, sincethis information can only be obtained if e2is atime expression.
The selection of features thatcontribute to the improvement of event-eventand event-timex classification will be detailed inSection 4.3.String features.
The tokens and lemmas ofe1and e2.Grammatical features.
The part of speech(PoS) tags of e1and e2, and a binary featureindicating whether e1and e2have the samePoS tag.
The binary feature only applies toevent-event pairs since we do not include thePoS tag of a time expression in the feature setof event-timex pairs.
The grammatical informa-tion is obtained using the Stanford CoreNLP tool.1Textual context.
The textual order, sentencedistance and entity distance of e1and e2.
Textualorder is the appearance order of e1and e2in thetext, while sentence distance measures how far e1and e2are from each other in terms of sentences,i.e.
0 if they are in the same sentence.
The entitydistance is only measured if e1and e2are in thesame sentence, and corresponds to the number ofentities occurring between e1and e2(i.e.
if theyare adjacent, the distance is 0).Entity attributes.
Event attributes and timeexpression attributes of e1and e2as specifiedin TimeML annotation.
Event attributes consistof class, tense, aspect and polarity, while theattributes of a time expression are its type, valueand dct (indicating whether a time expressionis the document creation time or not).
Eventsfalling under the category of noun, adjective and1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtmlpreposition do not have tense and aspect attributesin TimeML.
We retrieve this information byextracting the tense and aspect of the verbs thatgovern them, based on their dependency relation.For event-event pairs we also include four binaryfeatures representing whether e1and e2have thesame event attributes or not.Dependency relations.
Similar to D?Souzaand Ng (2013), we use the information related tothe dependency relation between e1and e2.
Weinclude as features (i) the type of the dependencyrelation that exists between them, (ii) the depen-dency order which is either governor-dependentor dependent-governor and (iii) binary featuresindicating whether e1/e2is the root of the sen-tence.
This information is based on the collapsedrepresentation of dependency relations providedby the parsing module of Stanford CoreNLP.Consider the sentence ?John left the office anddrove back home for 20 minutes?.
Using thecollapsed typed dependencies we could get the di-rect relations between the existing entities, whichare conj and(left, drove) and prep for(drove,minutes).Event durations.
To our knowledge, we arethe first to exploit event duration informationas features for temporal relation classification.In fact, duration can be expressed not only bya predicate?s tense and aspect but also by itsaktionsart, i.e.
the inherent temporal informationconnected to the meaning of a predicate.
Thetypical event duration allows us to infer, forinstance, that a punctual event is more likely tobe contained in a durative one.
If we consider thesentence ?State-run television broadcast footageof Cuban exiles protesting in Miami?, this featurewould tell us that broadcast lasts for hours whileprotesting lasts for days, thus contributing indetermining the direction of DURING relationbetween the events.The approximate duration for an event isobtained from the list of 1000 most frequentverbs and their duration distributions compiledby Gusev et al.
(2011).2The types of durationinclude seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,months, years and decades.
We also add theduration difference between e1and e2as a feature2The list is available at http://cs.stanford.edu/people/agusev/durations/310with the value varied between same, less or more.Similar to tense and aspect attributes for events,the duration of events under the category of noun,adjective and preposition are estimated by thegoverning verb.
As for time expressions, theirdurations are estimated from their type and valueattributes using a set of simple rules, e.g.
theduration of Thursday morning (with the type ofTIME and the value of xxxx-xx-xxTMO) is hours.Temporal signals.
Derczynski and Gaizauskas(2012) show the importance of temporal signalsin temporal link labelling.
We take this intoaccount by integrating in our features the list ofsignals extracted from TimeBank 1.2 corpus3.
Webelieve that the system performance will benefitfrom distinguishing between event-related signalsand timex-related signals, therefore we manuallysplit the signals into two separate lists.
Signalssuch as when, as and then are commonly usedto temporally connect events, while signals suchas at, for and within more likely occur with timeexpressions.
There are also signals that are usedin both cases such as before, after and until, andthose kind of signals are added to both lists.Besides the signal token, the position of the sig-nal with respect to the events or time expressionsis also an important feature.
Consider the positionof a signal in the sentences (i) ?John taught highschool before he worked at a bank?
and (ii)?Before John taught high school, he worked at abank?, which is crucial to determine the order ofJohn?s occupations.
We also include in the featureset whether a signal occurs at the beginning of asentence, as it is usually used to temporally relateevents in different sentences, e.g.
?John taughthigh school.
Previously, he worked at a bank.
?Temporal discourse connectives.
Considerthe following sentences:(i) ?John has been taking that driving coursesince the accident that took place last week.?
(ii) ?John has been taking that driving coursesince he wants to drive better.
?In order to label the temporal link holding be-tween two events, it is important to know whetherthere are temporal connectives in the surrounding3The list is available at http://www.timeml.org/site/timebank/browser_1.2/displayTags.php?treshold=1&tagtype=signal&sort=alphacontext, because they may contribute in identify-ing the relation type.
For instance, it may be rele-vant to distinguish whether since is used as a tem-poral or a causal cue (example (i) and (ii) resp.
).This information about discourse connectives isacquired using the addDiscourse tool (Pitler andNenkova, 2009), which identifies connectives andassigns them to one of four semantic classes: Tem-poral, Expansion, Contingency and Comparison.Note that this is a much shallower approach thanthe one proposed by D?Souza and Ng (2013), whoperform full discourse parsing.We include as feature whether a discourse con-nective belonging to the Temporal class occurs inthe textual context of e1and e2.
Similar to tem-poral signals, we also include in the feature set theposition of the discourse connective with respectto the events.3.3 Inverse Relations and Transitive ClosureSince Mani et al.
(2006) demonstrate that boot-strapping training data through temporal closureresults in quite significant improvements, we tryto provide the classifier with more data to learnfrom using the inverse relations and closure-basedinferred relations.There are six pairs of relation types in TimeMLthat inverse each other (see Table 1).
By switch-ing the order of the entities in a given pair and la-belling the pair with the inverse relation type, webasically multiply the number of training data.As for temporal closure, there have been at-tempts to apply it to improve temporal relationclassification.
Mani et al.
(2006) use SputLink(Verhagen, 2005), which was developed based onAllen?s closure inference (Allen, 1983), to inferthe relations based on temporal closure.
UzZamanand Allen (2011b) employ Timegraph (Gerevini etal., 1995) to implement the scorer for TempEval-3evaluation, since precision and recall for temporalrelation classification are computed based on theclosure graph.We use a simpler approach to obtain the closuregraph of temporal relations, by applying the tran-sitive closure only within the same relation type,e.g.
e1BEFORE e2?
e2BEFORE e3 ?
e1BE-FORE e3.
It can be seen as partial temporal clo-sure since it produces only a subset of the rela-tions produced by temporal closure, which coversmore complex cases, e.g.
e1BEFORE e2?
e2IN-CLUDES e3?
e1BEFORE e3.311As shown in Fischer and Meyer (1971), theproblem of finding the transitive closure of a di-rected acyclic graph can be reduced to a booleanmatrix multiplication.
For each temporal relationtype, we build its boolean matrix with the size ofn ?
n, n being the number of entities in a text.Given a temporal relation type R and its booleanmatrix M , the transitive closure-based relations ofR can be inferred from the matrix M2by extract-ing its non-zero elements.4 Experiment Description4.1 DatasetSince we want to compare our work with ex-isting approaches to temporal relation classifica-tion, we use the same training and test data asin Tempeval-3 challenge4.
Two types of train-ing data were made available in the challenge:TBAQ-cleaned and TE3-Silver-data.
The formerincludes a cleaned and improved version of theAQUAINT TimeML corpus, containing 73 newsreport documents, and the TimeBank corpus, with183 news articles.
TE3-Silver-data, instead, is a600K word corpus annotated by the best perform-ing systems at Tempeval-2, which we do not usein our experiments.Our test data is the newly created TempEval-3-platinum evaluation corpus that was anno-tated/reviewed by the Tempeval-3 task organizers.The distribution of the relation types in all previ-ously mentioned datasets is shown in Table 2.
Wereport also the statistics obtained after applying in-verse relations and transitive closure, that increasethe number of training instances.It is worth noticing that DURING INV relationdoes not exist in the training data but appears in thetest data.
In this case, inverse relations help in au-tomatically acquiring training instances.
The BE-FORE relation corresponds to the majority classand makes the instance distribution quite unbal-anced, especially in the TBAQ corpus.
Finally,five event-timex instances in the TBAQ trainingdata are labeled with IDENTITY relation and canbe assumed to be falsely annotated.4.2 Experimental SetupWe build our classification models using the Sup-port Vector Machine (SVM) implementation pro-4http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=datavided by YamCha5.
The experiment involves con-ducting 5-fold cross validation on the TimeBankcorpus to find the best combination of features forthe event-event and event-timex classifiers.
Wefirst run our experiments using YamCha defaultparameters (pairwise method for multi-class clas-sification and polynomial kernel of degree 2).
Af-ter identifying the best feature sets for the twoclassifiers, we evaluate them using different ker-nel degrees (from 1 to 4).4.3 Feature EngineeringIn order to select from our initial set of featuresonly those that improve the accuracy of the event-event and event-timex classifiers, we incremen-tally add them to the baseline (the model withstring feature only), and compute their contribu-tion.
Table 3 shows the results of this selectionprocess, by including the average accuracy fromthe 5-fold cross validation.In Table 3, we report the feature contributions ofthe entity attributes and dependency relations setsin more details, because within those categoriesonly some of the features have a positive impact onaccuracy.
Instead, for features within textual con-text, signal and discourse categories, incremen-tally adding each feature results in increasing ac-curacy, therefore we report only the overall accu-racy of the feature group.
Similarly, for durationfeatures, adding each feature incrementally resultsin decreasing accuracy.Regarding entity attributes, it can be seen thataspect and class features have no positive im-pact on the accuracy of event-event classifica-tion, along with pairwise features same class andsame polarity.
As for event-timex classification,all event attributes except for polarity contributeto accuracy improvements.
Among time expres-sion attributes, only the information about whethera time expression is a document creation time ornot (dct feature) helps improving the classifier.The dependency order feature does not givepositive contribution to the accuracy in both cases.Besides, information on whether an event is theroot of the sentence (dependency is root feature)is not relevant for event-timex classification.Adding the temporal signal feature very slightlyimproves the accuracy of event-event classifica-tion, not as much as its contribution to event-timex5http://chasen.org/?taku/software/yamcha/312Relationevent-event event-timextrain test train testTB TBAQ TBAQ-I TBAQ-IC TE3-P TB TBAQ TBAQ-I TBAQ-IC TE3-PBEFORE 490 2,115 2,938 5,685 226 661 1,417 1,925 2,474 96AFTER 458 823 2,938 5,685 167 205 509 1,925 2,474 29IBEFORE 22 60 103 105 1 2 3 8 8 5IAFTER 27 43 103 105 2 4 5 8 8 6BEGINS 24 44 86 85 0 20 65 89 89 1BEGUN BY 24 42 86 85 1 22 24 89 89 1ENDS 12 17 79 79 1 47 59 120 120 2ENDED BY 44 62 79 79 0 57 61 120 120 2DURING 46 80 80 84 1 197 200 200 201 1DURING INV 0 0 80 84 0 0 0 200 201 1INCLUDES 170 308 724 7,246 40 288 1,104 2,945 3,404 42IS INCLUDED 212 416 724 7,246 47 897 1,841 2,945 3,404 125SIMULTANEOUS 456 519 519 518 81 58 58 58 58 6IDENTITY 534 742 742 742 15 4 5 5 5 0Total 2,519 5,271 9,281 27,828 582 2,462 5,351 10,637 12,655 317Table 2: The distribution of each relation type in the datasets for both event-event and event-timex pairs.TB stands for TimeBank corpus, TBAQ denotes the combination of TimeBank and AQUAINT corpora,TBAQ-I denotes the TBAQ corpus augmented with inverse relations, TBAQ-IC is the TBAQ corpuswith both inverse relations and transitive closure, and TE3-P is the TempEval-3-platinum evaluationcorpus.classification.
However, together with the tem-poral discourse feature, they positively affect ac-curacy, confirming previous findings (Derczynskiand Gaizauskas, 2012).Surprisingly, adding event duration feature de-creases the accuracy in both cases.
This might becaused by the insufficient coverage of the eventduration resource, since around 20% of the train-ing pairs contain at least an event whose durationis unknown.
Moreover, we employ the approxi-mate duration of a verb event as a feature withoutconsidering the context and discourse.
For exam-ple, according to the distributions in the durationresource, the event attack has two likely durations,minutes and decades, with decades being slightlymore probable than minutes.
In the sentence ?Is-rael has publicly declared that it will respond toan Iraqi attack on Jordan.
?, the classifier fails torecognize the IBEFORE relation between attackand respond (attack happens immediately beforerespond), because the duration feature of attack isrecognized as decades, while in this context theattack most probably occurs within seconds.According to the analysis of the different fea-ture contributions, we define the best classificationmodels for both event-event pairs and event-timexpairs as the models using combinations of featuresthat have positive impacts on the accuracy, basedon Table 3.
Given the best performing sets of fea-tures, we further experiment with different kerneldegrees in the same 5-fold cross validation sce-nario.The best classifier performances are achievedwith the polynomial kernel of degree 4, both forevent-event and event-timex classification.
Theaccuracy for event-event classification is 43.69%,while for event-timex classification it is 66.62%.However, using a high polynomial kernel degreeintroduces more complexity in training the classi-fication model, thus more time is required to trainsuch models.D?Souza and Ng (2013) evaluate their systemon the same corpus, but with a slightly differentsetting.
They also split TimeBank into 5 folds,but they only use two of them to perform 2-foldcross validation, while they use another part of thecorpus to develop rules for their hybrid system.Their best configuration gives 46.8% accuracy forevent-event classification and 65.4% accuracy forevent-timex classification.
Although the two ap-proaches are not directly comparable, we can as-sume that the systems?
performance are likely tobe very similar, with a better accuracy on event-event classification by D?Souza and Ng (2013) anda better performance on event-timex pairs by oursystem.
Probably, the hybrid system by D?Souzaand Ng, which integrates supervised classificationand manual rules, performs better on event-eventclassification because it is a more complex taskthan event-timex classification, where simple lex-ical and syntactic features are still very effective.313event-event event-timexFeature Accuracy Feature Accuracymajority class 22.17% - majority class 36.42% -string 31.07% - string 58.27% -+grammatical 36.15% 5.08% +grammatical 61.30% 3.03%+textual context 39.44% 3.29% +textual context 61.71% 0.41%+tense 41.10% 1.66% +tense 63.10% 1.39%+aspect 41.10% 0.00% +aspect 64.51% 1.41%+class 39.96% -1.14% +class 65.30% 0.79%+polarity 40.44% 0.48% +polarity 64.88% -0.42%+same tense 40.55% 0.11% +dct 65.21% 0.33%+same aspect 40.63% 0.08% +type 64.99% -0.22%+same class 40.63% 0.00% +value 64.60% -0.39%+same polarity 40.47% -0.16%+ dependency 42.15% 1.68% +dependecy 65.60% 1.00%+dependency order 41.99% -0.16% +dependency order 65.47% -0.13%+dependency is root 42.63% 0.64% +dependency is root 65.22% -0.25%+temporal signal 42.66% 0.03% +temporal signal 65.43% 0.21%+temporal discourse 42.82% 0.16%+duration 41.47% -1.35% +duration 64.19% -1.24%Table 3: Feature contributions for event-event and event-timex classification.
Features in italics have anegative impact on accuracy and are not included in the final feature set.5 EvaluationWe perform two types of evaluation.
In the firstone, we evaluate the system performance with thebest feature sets and the best parameter configu-ration using the four training sets presented in Ta-ble 2.
Our test set is the TempEval-3-platinum cor-pus.
The goal of this first evaluation is to specifi-cally investigate the effect of enriching the trainingdata with inverse relations and transitive closure.We compute the system accuracy as the percent-age of the correct labels out of all annotated links.In the second evaluation, we compare our sys-tem to the systems participating in the task on tem-poral relation classification at TempEval-3.
Thetest set is again TempEval-3-platinum, i.e.
thesame one used in the competition.
The task or-ganizers introduced an evaluation metric (UzZa-man and Allen, 2011a) capturing temporal aware-ness in terms of precision, recall and F1-score.
Tocompute precision and recall, they verify the cor-rectness of annotated temporal links using tempo-ral closure, by checking the existence of the iden-tified relations in the closure graph.
In order toreplicate this type of evaluation, we use the scorermade available to the task participants.5.1 Evaluation of the Effects of InverseRelations and Transitive ClosureTable 4 shows the classifiers?
accuracies achievedusing different training sets.
After performing arandomization test between the best performingclassifier and the others, we notice that on event-event classification the improvement is significant(p < 0.005) only between TBAQ and TimeBank.This shows that only extending the TimeBank cor-pus by adding AQUAINT is beneficial.
In all othercases, the differences are not significant.
Applyinginverse relations and transitive closure extends thenumber of training instances but makes the datasetmore unbalanced, thus it does not result in a sig-nificant improvement.Training data event-event event-timexTimeBank 42.61% 71.92%TBAQ 48.28% 73.82%TBAQ-I 47.77% 74.45%TBAQ-IC 46.39% 74.45%Table 4: Classifier accuracies with different train-ing dataThis result is in contrast with the improvementbrought about by temporal closure reported inMani et al.
(2006).
The difference between ourapproach and Mani et al.
?s is that (i) we apply onlythe transitive closure instead of the full temporalone, and (ii) our classification task includes 14 re-lations, while the other authors classify 6 relations.In our future work, we will investigate whether thebenefits of closure are affected by the number ofrelations, or whether our simplified version is ac-tually outperformed by the full one.Furthermore, we plan to investigate the effect ofover-sampling to handle highly skewed datasets,for instance by applying inverse relations and tran-sitive closure only to minority classes.3145.2 Evaluation of the System Performance inTempEval-3 taskWe train our classifiers for event-event pairs andevent-timex pairs by exploiting the best featurecombination and best configuration acquired fromthe experiment, and using the best reported datasetfor each classifier as the training data.
Eventhough it has been shown that inverse relations andtransitive closure do not bring significantly posi-tive impact to the accuracy, using the TBAQ-ICcorpus as the training set for event-timex classifi-cation is still the best option.
The two classifiersare part of a temporal classification system calledTRelPro.We compare in Table 5 the performance ofTRelPro to the other systems participating inTempeval-3 task, according to the figures reportedin (UzZaman et al., 2013).

The system generallyfails to recognize IBEFORE, BEGINS, ENDS andDURING relations, along with their inverse rela-tions, primarily because of the skewed distributionof instances in the training data, especially in com-parison with the majority classes.
This explainsalso the large number of false positives labelled forthe BEFORE class (event-event pairs) and for theIS INCLUDED class (event-timex pairs), whichare the majority classes for the two pairs respec-tively.6 ConclusionWe have described an approach to temporal linklabelling using simple features based on lexico-syntactic information, as well as external lexicalresources listing temporal signals and event dura-Relationevent-event event-timextp fp fn tp fp fnBEFORE 186 186 40 82 17 14AFTER 63 40 104 14 7 15IBEFORE 0 0 1 0 0 5IAFTER 0 0 2 0 0 6BEGINS 0 0 0 0 0 1BEGUN BY 0 0 0 0 0 1ENDS 0 0 1 0 0 2ENDED BY 1 1 0 0 0 2DURING 0 0 1 0 2 1DURING INV 0 0 0 0 0 1INCLUDES 1 2 39 27 13 15IS INCLUDED 2 4 45 114 40 11SIMULTANEOUS 20 33 61 0 0 6IDENTITY 9 35 6 0 1 0Table 6: Relation type distribution for TempEval-3-platinum test data, annotated with TRelPro.

We find that by using a simple feature set wecan build a system that outperforms the systemsbuilt using more sophisticated features, based onsemantic role labelling and deep semantic parsing.This may depend on the fact that more complexfeatures are usually extracted from the output ofNLP systems, whose performance impacts on thequality of such features.We find that bootstrapping the training data withinverse relations and transitive closure does nothelp improving the classifiers?
performances sig-nificantly as it was reported in previous works, es-pecially in event-event classification where the ac-curacy decreases instead.
In the future, we willfurther investigate the reason of this difference.We will also explore other variants of closure, aswell as over-sampling techniques to handle thehighly skewed dataset introduced by closure.Finally, the overall performance of our system,using the best models for both event-event andevent-timex classification, outperforms the othersystems participating in the TempEval-3 task.
Thisconfirms our intuition that using simple featuresand reducing the amount of complex semantic anddiscourse information is a valuable alternative tomore sophisticated approaches.AcknowledgmentsThe research leading to this paper was partiallysupported by the European Union?s 7th Frame-work Programme via the NewsReader Project(ICT-316404).315ReferencesJames F.
