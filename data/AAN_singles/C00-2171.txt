Mostwork on multilingual lexicons up to now has as-sumed mouolingual lexicons linked only at the levelof semantics (MUI_TILEX 1993; Copestake t al.1992).
Cahill and Gazdar (1999) show that thisapproach might be appropriate for unrelated lan-guages, as for example English and Japanese, butthat it makes it impossible to capture useful gener-alisations about related languages - such as Englishand German.
Related languages share many linguis-tic characteristics at all levels of description - syn-tax, morphology, phonology, etc.
- not just seman-tics.
For instance, words which come fl'om a singleroot have very similar orthographic and phonologi-cal forms.
Compare English, Dutch, and German1:IThe lranscriptions are taken from CELEX (Baayen et al1995) and use tile SAMPA phonetic alphabet (Wells 1989).Dutch Gernmnbed Bett/bEt/ /bEt/rib Rippe/rip/ /rip@/hand ltand/hAnt/ /hant/kat Katze/kAt/ /kats @/Most differences can be attributed to dil'ferentorthographic conventions and regular phonologicalchanges (e.g.
final devoicing in Dutch and German).The English/{I, the Dutch/AI, and the German/a/in the last two exmnples, are even virtually the same.They have slightly different realisations but they arephonologically non-distinctive, i.e.
if the Dutch/A/were substituted by the English/{/in Dutch, the re-sult would not be a different word, but it would sim-ply sound like a different accent.Cahill and Gazdar (I 999) describe an architecturefor nmltilingual lexicons which aims to encode andexploit lexical similarities between closely relatedlanguages.
This architecture has been successfullyapplied in the PolyLex project 2 to define a trilinguallexicon for Dutch, English, and German sharingmorphological, phonological, and lnorphophono-logical information between these languages.in this paper, we will take the Polykex fiame-work as our basis.
We will focus on the phono-logical similarities between related hmguages andwe will extend the PolyLex approach by capturingcross-linguistic phoneme correspondences, such asthe/{/-/A/-/a/correspondence mentioned above 3.First, we will discuss how a phoneme inventorycan be defined for a group of languages - l)utch,2http://www.cogs.

Then, we will explain tilemultilingual architecture used in PolyLex.
Finally,we will explore how these cross-linguistic phonemecorrespoudences can be integrated into tile multilin-gual frmnework.2 A Metaphoneme InventoryIn this section we describe how a phoneme inven-tory can be defined for a group of languages inwhich language-specific phonemes flmction its "al-lophones" of newly defined metaphonemes.
We willrestrict ourselves to the vowel phonemes of l)utch,English, and Gerlnan.
If we know, for example,that words which are realised with an /{I in En-glish are usually realised with an/A/ in I)utch, andan/a / in  German (as in hand/h{nd/ versus/hAnt/w:rsus/hant/, cal/k{t/versus/kArl versus/kats(@/,elc.
), we might be able to generalise over these threehmguage-specific phonemes and introduce a meta-phoneme, e.g.
I{Aa\], which captures this generali-sation.To give an impression of the distribution of thedifferent vowel phonemes across l)utch, English,and German, their vowel charts (K6nig and van derAuwera 1994; Wells 1989) were merged into onebig vowel chart containing all the vowel phonemesof these three hmguages.

Knowing that Dutch and German both havea phoneme/o:/, does not mean that they are cross-linguistically non-distinctive.qb find cross-linguistic phoneme correspon-deuces, we followed O'Connor's (1973) strategyfor establishing phonelne conespondences betweendifl'erent accents, identifying phonemes of one ac-cent with those el' another:"How are we to decide whether to equatephoneme X with phoneme A or withphoneme D?
We can do so only on thebasis el' the words in which they occur:if X and A both occur in a large numberof words common to both accents we linkthem together as representing the samepoint on the pattern, if, on the other hand,X shares more words with D than with A,we l inkXandD.
\[...\] Even so, i fXandD occur in a very similar word-set and Xand A do not, then it is much more reveal-ing to equate X and D than X and A.

We compiled a listof g00 (mono- and disyllabic) Germanic ognates,looked up the transcriptions in the CELEX database(Baayen el al.
1995), and then mapped words con-tainiug a palticular vowel in one hmguage onto itscognates in the other two hmguages to see how thisparticular vowel was realised in tile other two lan-guages.
This process was repeated for all the vow-els, for all three languages.A few examples of tile results we obtained for En-glish vowels are included below c'.As can be seen fl'om these v, tlaere is some vari-ation in the closeness of the correspondences.

We focus onphonology rather than orthography as phonology isnearer to primary language use (i.e.
spoken lan-guage), it can be used as input for hyphenation rules,spelling correction, and it is essential as the level ofsymbolic representation for speech synthesis (MUDTILEX 1993).1128We will take the multilingual architecture ofPolyLex as our starting point.
First, we will describethe PolyLex arclaitecture.
Then, we will show howphonological information can be shared in the lexi-cal entries.PolyLex detines a multilingual inheritance-basedlexicon for l)utch, English and German.
It isimplemented in DATR, an inheritance-based lexi-cal knowledge representation formalism (Evans andGazdar 1996).
The rationale of inheritance-basedlexicons requires information to be pushed as far upthe hierarchy as it can go, generalising as much aspossible.
In a multilingual exicon, this means thatinformation which is common to several anguagesis stated at higher points in the hierarchy than thatwhich is unique to just one of the languages.
Inaddition, Polykex makes use of orthogonal multipleinheritance which allows a node in the hierarchy toinherit different kinds of information (e.g.
seman-tics, morphology, phonology, syntax) fi'om differentparent nodes.
In this papen we are just interested inthe phonological hierarchy.Polykex assumes a contemporary phonologicalfralnework in which all lexical entries are detinedas having a phonological structure consisting of asequence of structured syllables, a syllable consist-ing o1' an onset (the initial consonant cluster, whichmight be split up into onset 1, onset 2, etc.)
and arhylne.
The rhyme consists of a peak (the vowel)and a coda (the final consonant cluster, which mightbc split up into coda 1, coda 2, etc.).
This struc-ture is defined at the top el' the hierarchy, and ap-plies by default o all words.
Only the relevant val-ues for onset, peal<, and coda have to be defined atthe individual exical entries (see Cahill and Gazdar1!)97).
Following PolyLex we will concentrate on asegmental phonelnic representation.
An example ofthe lexical entry gram as it would be represented inPolyLex, is shown in figure 2.The multilingual phonological entry for gram, isdelined by sharing identical segments occnrring inthe majority of the language-specific entries (/gr{m/- /xrAm/-/gram/).
That is, onset 1 is/g/, onset 2 is/1"/, and coda is/m/.English and German can inherit all the informa-tion fiom the common part except for the value oftheir peak, which is respectively /{/ and /a/.
InDutch, the value of the peak has to be specified asbeing/A/, plus we will have to override the wduefor the first onset o get \[xrAm\].This example misses the generalisation that thePeak = {Coll ln'lonMGram:Onset 1 = gOnset 2 = rCoda = IllEng l i sh  Dutch  GermanOnset I = xl'cak = A Peak = aSyllableOnset Rhyme?
/XPeak Coda?
?Figure 2: A multilingual inheritance lexicon with-out metaphonemesEnglish/{/, the Dutch/A/, and the German/a/arephonologically non-distinctive.
For each lexical ca-try where English uses/{/, l)utch/A/, and German/a/, the value for peak has to be specitied in thelanguage-specific parts.
By using the metaphonemeI{Aal instead, this information needs to be speci-fied only once.
The resulting multilingual phonemicrepresentation for gram is given in ligure 3.M_,;, ......

The information that \]{Aa\] results illan/{/in English, an/A/in Dutch, and an/a/in Ger-man is specified only at the top level.
The language-specitic boxes are almost empty, except for the valueof the first onset in Dutch.
The reason for this isthat as yet we have only defined cross-linguisticphoneme correspondences for vowels, not for con-sonants.
We do, howevm, suspect that the Dutch/x/is phonologically non-distinctive fi'om the Germanand English /g/.
Further research defining cross-linguistic phoneme correspondences forconsonants1129will have to confirm this.It is a fundamental feature of this account thatthe inherited information is only default informa-tion which can be overridden.
Thus, it is not re-quired that metaphoneme correspondences are com-plete and we may choose to use a metaphonemeeven if one of the languages uses a different vowelin some words.
The definitions can be overriddenin exactly the same way as the onset definition inDutch in the example above.
So if we consider thevowel correspondences in table 1, we can see thatof the 35 words which have cognates in all threelanguages, 27 can be defined as having the meta-phoneme \[{Aa I in the common lexical entry (thosefor which both English and l)utch have the corre-sponding vowels).
Five of these will require a sep-arate vowel defined for Gerlnan, while the remain-der will need separate vowel definitions for all threelanguages.Given this, we can see that economy of rep-resentation can be achieved even in cases wherethe vowel correspondences are far from conclusive.Even if only half or fewer of the Dutch words, forexample, have the same vowel in cognates for whichthe English words have the same vowel, this stillmeans that those half can be defined without theneed for the language-specific vowel to be defined.Another feature of the metaphoneme principlethat differentiates it from the phonemic principleis that there is no requirement for biuniqueness.A phoneme in a language can be a realisation ofmorn than one metaphoneme.
This means that wecan define a metaphoneme I{Aa\[ as well as another,IA:Aal.
Each of these will then be used in differentcommon lexical entries.
This can be used as an al-ternative to phonological/phonotactic conditioningor in addition to it, for just those cases where thereis more than one correspondence but no obviousphonologicai/phonotactic onditioning for the deci-sion between phonemes.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we have discussed the concept ofmetaphonemes.
Metaphonemes are cross-linguisticphoneme correspondences such as the English/{/,the Dutch/A/,  and the German/a/correspondenceinentioned above.
At the lnultilingual level, therealisation of the metaphoneme is conditioned bythe choice of language.
At the lower monolinguallevel its realisation as an allophone of a particularphoneme is conditioned by the phonological envi-romnent.
As such, a metaphoneme is a generalisa-tion of a generalisation.We have shown how a metaphoneme inventorycan be defined for a group of languages and thatincorporating these cross-linguistic phoneme corre-spondences in a multilingual inheritance lexicon in-creases the number of generalisations that can becaptured.
Calculations on the syllable inventories ofDutch, English, and German in the CELEX databaseshow that the introduction of metaphonemes in-creases the amount of sharing at the syllable levelby about 25%.Another benefit of introducing metaphonemes isimproved robustness in NLP systems.
Knowledgeabout cross-linguistic ommonalities can help toprovide grounds for making an "intelligent" guesswhen a lexical item for a particular language is notpresent.Tiffs research as concentrated on cross-linguisticvowel phoneme correspondences.
Similar researchwill be done for consonants.ReferencesBaayen, 1t., R. Piepenbrock and It.
