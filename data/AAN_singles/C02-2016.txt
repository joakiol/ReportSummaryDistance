Several directions for minority languages computerizationVincent BERMENTGETA, CLIPS, Joseph Fourier University385 avenue de la Biblioth?queSaint-Martin-d'H?res, France, 38400vincent.berment@imag.frAbstractLess than 1% of the languages spoken in theworld are correctly ?computerized?
: spellcheckers, hyphenation, machine translationare still lacking for the others.
In this paper,we present several directions that may helpthe computerization of minority languagesas well as two projects where we apply someof these directions to the Lao language.IntroductionDuring the last ten years, research has beendriven and products have been developed toprovide efficient linguistic tools for manylanguages.
For example, Unicode is more andmore a reality in today's operating systems andMicrosoft Office XP contains proofing tools formore than 40 languages.
However, for most ofthe world's people, the Information Era is stilllimited to using hardware and software that donot meet their needs in terms of language andscript resources.
Following the SALTMIL1terminology, we will call a minority language alanguage which has a smaller resource base thanthe major languages.1 The available and the neededAccording to the Ethnologue2, more than 6800different languages are spoken in the world.
Thisnumber of languages shows that we are still farfrom having a software answer for all of them.1 : Speech And Language Technology for MInorityLanguages (http://isl.ntftex.uni-lj.si/SALTMIL/) is aSpecial Interest Group of the International SpeechCommunication Association.2 : http://www.ethnologue.com/.1.1 Commercial toolsFirst, we will notice that a trend in operatingsystems design and standardization allows therecent multilingual evolution.
Windows (sinceWindows NT 3.1), MacIntosh (since MacOS8.5) and Unix/Linux now support Unicode andmany fonts are available, especially TrueTypefonts3 such as Arial Unicode MS which containsa large part of Unicode (51,180 glyphs but also23 Mb that may slow our computers).If we look now at Microsoft Office4, one of themost widespread business suite, we observe thatlinguistic tools are available for 48 languages5.1.2 Research on minority languagesThough we may find that the coverage of severaltens of languages in tools such as a wordprocessor is a significant evolution because itcovers most of the languages in terms of numberof speakers, we also have to notice that it stillcovers less than 1% of them in terms of numberof languages.This question has been increasingly discussed inthe recent years.
The SALTMIL group was3 : TrueType fonts can be used under Windows,MacOS X and Linux as well as, with limitations,under previous versions of MacOS.4 : http://www.microsoft.com/office/evaluation/indepth/multilingual/prooftools.htm5 : These languages are: Arabic, Basque, BrazilianPortuguese, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese Simplified,Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch,English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician,German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian,Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean,Latvian, Lithuanian, Marathi, Norwegian, Polish,Portuguese (Portugal), Punjabi, Romanian, Russian,Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish,Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnameseand Welsh.created to ?promote research and developmentin the field of speech and language technologyfor lesser-used languages, particularly those ofEurope?.
Since 1998, it has organized specificworkshops at the LREC conferences.Another definition of ?minority language?
isused to talk about non-indigenous minoritylanguages.
This definition may differ from theSALTMIL one.
The Lancaster University (UK)has two ongoing projects related to such?minority languages?.
The Minority LanguageEngineering (MILLE) project1, ?jointly based inthe Department of Linguistics at LancasterUniversity and Oxford University ComputingServices, seeks to investigate the development ofcorpus resources for UK non-indigenousminority languages2 (NIMLs)?.
The EnablingMinority Language Engineering (EMILLE)project3, a joined project of Lancaster andSheffield Universities, plans to ?build a 63million word electronic corpus of South Asianlanguages, especially those spoken in the UK?.Here, the considered languages are Bengali,Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Singhalese, Tamil andUrdu which are, for some of them, alreadywidely studied languages.2 Difficult issuesAfter having verified that the need of script iscovered by Unicode or at least by a de factostandard or simply by a font, one of the firstdifficulties generally met when starting with anew language is the lack of texts anddictionaries.
This prevents, in particular,classical machine translation solutions frombeing immediately applied.
Here raises a majorproblem: such resources are time consuming, inother terms expensive.
So we need to find a way,in line with the often limited means of theminority languages populations, for gettingresources or, alternatively, to build newmethods, based on smaller linguistic resources.1 : http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/monkey/ihe/mille/1fra1.htm2 : A census done in the UK in 1991 stated that non-indigenous ethnic minorities formed about 6% of theGreat Britain population (Somers 1997).3 : Enabling Minority Language Engineeringhttp://www.emille.lancs.ac.uk/.3 Directions3.1 Generalized Linguistic ContributionOur point of view is that linguistic resources canbe efficiently obtained by a collaborative workon the web (Boitet 1999), replacing a localdevelopment team with a free and potentiallymuch bigger distributed team.
This idea of a?generalized linguistic contribution?
on the web,already present in an early Montaigne project(1996), has recently been implemented at GETAfor the Lao language in a revisited version (see?
4.2).
It has also been applied by Oki to theJapanese language4 (Shimohata  2001) and byNII/NECTEC to a Japanese-Thai dictionary5.
Atanother (a meta-) level, the Open LanguageArchives Community6 (OLAC) provides acollaborative platform for "creating a worldwidevirtual library of language resources".
Foundedin December 2000, this recent project alreadygathers more than twenty participants (dataproviders) which resources can be accessed byusing a service provider such as "the Linguist"7.3.2 Dictionary recyclingAn alternative solution for building electronicdictionaries is to reengineer the document filesmade with a word processor to produce a paperlexicon or dictionary.
When the files are notavailable, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)can sometimes be used to create it.
There,recycling tools have to be applied to transformthe original irregular format into a format that issuitable for automated tasks (Nguyen 1998).3.3 Using analogy between languagesAnother interesting direction is to take party ofthe similarities between languages, in particularin machine translation projects (Paul 2001).Here are several recent examples in the minoritylanguages area.In Europe, machine translation projects betweenSpanish and two languages closely related toSpanish ?
Catalan (Canals-Marote et al  2001)and Galician (Diz 2001) ?
are already working.4 : http://www.yakushite.net/.5 : Saikam project, http://saikam.nii.ac.jp/.6 : http://www.language-archives.org/.7 : http://www.linguistlist.org/olac/.In Asia, an example with languages fromdifferent families1 such as Japanese and Uighurshows that syntactical closeness can besufficient to obtain good results (MAJO system,Mahsut et al  2001).These machine translation projects based onanalogy generally use a relatively low leveltransfer module and present satisfying responsetimes thanks to the use of finite state algorithms.3.4 International pivot-based projectsThe achievement of good quality machinetranslation for minority languages can beboosted by the adoption of a pivot approach.
Insuch an approach, the development of oneinterface (with a pivot) gives access to alllanguages.
International pivot-based projectssuch as Papillon2 and UNL3 provide examples ofsuch pivot-based projects including minoritylanguages.
For example, after an initial periodwhere only major languages were involved, lesscomputerized languages such as Mongolian andLatvian have been looked at in the UNL project.3.5 CMU approachThe Language Technologies Institute of theCarnegie Mellon University developed anoriginal approach of machine translation for theAVENUE project (Probst & Levin 2002).
Thismulti-engine system, based on a corpus-basedmachine translation (CBMT), uses both EBMTand SMT4 as well as an elicitation tool5 thatlearns transfer rules from a small and controlledcorpus.
This elicitation tool, currently beingapplied to Mapudungun, a language from Chile,seems to be well suited to the minoritylanguages because of its low need of linguisticresources.4 Ongoing projects at GETAHereafter are presented two developments wecurrently undertake at GETA in Grenoble toapply the ideas presented here6.
Both are1 : Uighur is a Turkic language and Japanese isconsidered as independent (Katzner 1995).2 : http://vulab.ias.unu.edu/papillon/.3 : http://www.unl.ias.unu.edu/.4 : Example-Based and Statistical MT.5 : Called iRBMT = instructible Rule-Based MT.6 : In our works, we focus on ?minority languages?applying these ideas to the Lao language.
Lao isspoken in Laos by about 4 million people and inThailand by more than 10 million people7.4.1 PapiLex84.1.1 PrinciplesPapiLex, a Lao lexical base developed in thecontext of the pivot-based Papillon project,follows the fundamental rules of this project:?
lexical base in XML format,?
use of the explanatory and combinatoriallexicology (ECL) concepts9 (from which thecore monolingual Papillon XML schema isdirectly derived),?
use of Unicode for the characters encoding.PapiLex is a mockup aimed at giving a help inevaluating the Papillon project difficulties.
Thedictionary structure contains eight fields, derivedfrom the ECL:?
Lexical item,?
Part of speech,?
Semantic formula,?
Government pattern,?
Lexical functions,?
Examples,?
Idioms,?
Interlingual meaning.4.1.2 ArchitecturePapiLex has been developed using HTML andPerl.
The Perl scripts handle the interaction withthe XML base.
The interface with this baserelies on DOM, the Document Object Modelstandardized by the W3C.
We used a DOMpackage for Perl which can be found on theperl.com site.
The parsing set used on the webserver is the one which is included in ActivePerl5.6.1 for Windows.
It is made out of the Larrytaken in the SALTMIL definition sense.7 : In the Isan area of Thailand where Lao is spoken,Thai scripts are used and also the language itself issomehow different from Lao spoken in Laos.
There isalso an important Lao diaspora in France, Australiaand USA.

la lexico-graphie explicative et combinatoire, Duculot 1995Wall and Clark Cooper ?XML::Parser?
packageand of ?Expat?, the James Clark's XML parser.4.2 Montaigne project14.2.1 Initial specificationsBasically, the Montaigne project?s idea is tooffer a free collaborative work facility on theweb for development of linguistic resources andmachine translation tools.
Though its ambition isgeneric, the project started with an application toLao.In this early form, the web site mainly offersthree kinds of services:?
Lao-French translations,?
Transcriptions of Lao,?
Lexicographic creation.Contrarily to the two first items (translations andtranscriptions) which are open to all visitors, thelexicographic creation access is limited toregistered skilled users.
Each registered user hashis own space where he can save his privatewords and texts.The linguistic structure of the dictionary followsthe ECL concepts so it can easily be exportedtoward Papillon.
However, additional fields havealso been added in order to derive otherapplications from the database as for examplepaper dictionaries or machine translation.In order to start the process, a first dictionary of1038 words has been entered, simply derivingfrom a paper dictionary done by LamviengInthamone in Word format.
So this initialdictionary does not meet yet the ECL concept oflexical item required for exporting the dictionarytoward Papillon.
An ?ECLization?
of this basedictionary is then currently being handled by agroup of Lao students from Inalco2 (InstitutNational des Langues et des CivilisationsOrientales, located in Paris).
This team willproduce an ECL-compliant dictionary that willreplace the current one at the end of their task.4.2.2 ArchitectureThe architecture is based on HTML, SSI, PHP,JavaScript and compiled C code used as CGI.The dictionary is stored as a MySQL databasetable as well as the contributors?
profiles.
C code1 : http://cams-atid.ivry.cnrs.fr/montlao/.2 : http://www.inalco.fr.is used for segmenting Lao texts into words3 andfor sorting the dictionary4.
It uses a syllablerecognition technology (Berment 1998) and alongest matching algorithm (e.g.
Meknavin et al1997).
Unlike PapiLex, the Montaigne Laoproject uses non-Unicode fonts.
This is mainlydue to the unavailability of Unicode fonts forLao that would actually work.
Text input ispossible with the two currently used Laokeyboard layouts thanks to JavaScript and toTextArea or Input HTML forms controls.4.2.3 Several viewsTranslation serviceOriginal text input page (Lao)Word for word translation page (French)3 : Lao is written from left to right with an alphabetderiving from Indian scripts.
A major characteristicsof Lao writing is that words are not separated withspaces, like Khmer, Thai or Burmese writings.4 : Another important characteristics of Lao writing isthat some vowels are placed before the consonant.This contributes to make the automatic sort of Laodictionaries more complex.Lexical items input pageOrdered list of lexical itemsConclusionIn the close future, we plan to develop theMontaigne project in two directions.First, the current prototype will become a fullscale production tool.
For that, the Lao-Frenchtranslations and the lexicographic creation willbe linked together so that a registered user canmodify a translation.
This will update his privatedictionary and the altered word will besubmitted to the Linguistic Management Teamfor updating the common dictionary.
Analogybetween Lao and Thai languages will also belooked at.The second anticipated milestone is to developthe project toward its initial generic aim: a freecollaborative work facility on the web fordevelopment of linguistic resources and machinetranslation tools for any minority language.
Thisincludes:?
gathering a free and structured set of generictools (lemmatizers, segmenters, speechtools, ...) and making them available on theweb site,?
offering a collaborative environment foreach candidate language, derived from theLao experimental one.ReferencesBerment Vincent.
