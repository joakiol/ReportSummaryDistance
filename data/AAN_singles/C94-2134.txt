ukAbstractThis pat)er t)resents ome techniques for selectinglinguistically adequate hypol;heses of new gram-mat.foal knowledge to be used as resources ofgralmnatical knowledge acquisition.
In our frame-work of liuguistic knowledge acquisition, a rule-based hypothesis generator is inw)ked in case ofparsing failures and all the possible hypotheses ofLlew graliLlnar rules or lexical entries are gener-ated ffOln partial parsing results.
Although eachhypothesis could recover the (lef>cl, s of the exist-ing grammar, the greater part of hypotheses arelinguistically unnatural.
The techniques we pro-pose here prevent such unnatural hypotheses Dontbeing gene,'ated without discarding plausible onesand make the following corpus-based acquisitionl)rocess In(ire ellieien(, and more reliable.1 I n t roduct ionReusability of existing linguistic knowledge is the mostimport,~mt requirement for the rapid development ofpra.ctical nal, ural \]augtlage l)rocessing systems.
In or-der to realize, automatic ustomizatiou of existing lin-guistic knowledge to each applicat;ion domain, we pro-posed a new approach of linguistic knowledge acquisi-tion, which is a combination of symbolic and statisticalapproaches \[Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993\].The fi:amework of our al)proach is shown in Figure 1.'1'111".

In this paper, some techniquesto remove such inadequate hytml, heses are proposedand the results of exl)eriments which show the efl'ec-l.iwme.ss of the proposed techniques are also discussed.2 Grammar Hypothes iz ing2.1 Grammar Formal i smThe grammar lbrlnalisnl we use is a conventionaluniIication-based grammar.
F, ach gramLnar rule iswritten in the form of a combination of a conl, ext-freerule and feature unilication functions.
This R)rmalismis not specitic to any linguistic ~;heory, but we inl.ro-duced a number of concepts widely accepted in lil,-guisl, ic theories, such as grammatical f mctions, sub- categorization |'ralLies, aim X-bar theory.
'FILe parsing system we introdttced 1,11 allply ourgrammar lbrlnalism is a sysl,enl called SAX \[Mat-smnoto, 1986\].
SAX uses the concepts of act, iw~' andinactive edges of Chart P~lrsing and analyses an in-put sentence with a bottom-up and parallel algoril;hm.As the grammar hyl)othesiziLLg algorithm is supposedl:o refer partial parsiug results of unsuccessflflly parsedsentences, we slightly modified SAX so that it ou/.lmtsinactive edges as partial parsing results.8372.2 Basic  Algor i thmWhen SAX fails to parse a sentence, no inactive edgeof category 5' sl/anning the whole sentencc exists in theparsing result.
Grammar tlypothesizing is a process tointroduce this inactive edge by augnlentmg the currentgramnmr.
The basic part of the hypothesis generationalgorithm is written as fbllows:\ [Algor i thm\]  An inactive edge lie(A) : a:o, '%1 Ca l l  beintroduced from x0 to x,~, with label A, by each ofthe \]lypotheses generated by the following two steps.\[Step 1\] For each sequence of inactive edges,lie(B1): :r0,Xl\] , .

, \[ie(A,) : :,:,,_~, x,~\], andcall this algorithm ibr \[ie(Ai) : xi-1, .vii.Feature  Structures: A rule generated in \[Step 1\]could be a lexieal entry when this top-down algorithmreaches the bottom.
As we adopted a unification-based grmnmar fbrmalism, we extended the algorithmso thai, it can hyt)othesize a feature structure of a lex-ical entry by observing surrounding successful cate-gories.
As the algorithm works even ibr a eOml)lexfeature like a subcategorization frame, it can be usedto acquire a subeategorization dictionary.
While someprevious works on subcategorization fi'alne acquisitionassumed very little prior knowledge concerning theclassification of subcategorization frames \[Brent, 1991;Manning, 1993\], our apllroach assumes the existenceof grammar rules Sllecifying subcategorization fi'ameassignment, which enables more accurate learning ofsubcategorization frames.Mult iple Defects: In \[Step 2\] of the algorithm, itis SUl)t)osed that each unsuccessfully parsed sentencehas exactly one cause of failure but a sentmtee in actualtexts often contains two or more causes of failure (forexample, two unknown words).
To solve this problem,we extended the algorithm so that it searches for amultiple hypothesis which is a set of rewriting rulesand lexlcal entries.3 Hypothes is  Se lect ion3.1 Bas ic  Grammat ica l  Const ra in tsFrom a linguistic point of view, hypotheses generatedby the algorithnl given above might contain nlany un-natural hypotheses because the algorithm itself doesnot have any linguistic knowledge to judge the appro-priateness of hypotheses.
To remove unnatural hy-potheses, we have introduced the following criteria\[Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993\].?
The maximum number of adjacent unsuccessful cat-egories is set to 2 in order not to decrease the efIi-ciency of the algorithm.?
The lnaxilnuln nulnber of daughter nodes is set to 3.?
Supl)osing that the existing grammar contains allthe category conversion rules, a mmry rule whichhas only one daughter node is not generate.d.?
Using generalizations embodied ill the existinggrammar, a hypothesis contaiuing a sequence ofsubnodes which are collected into a larger categoryby existing grammar ules is not generated.?
Distinguishing non-lexieal categories from lexica.lcategories, a hypothesis whose mother category isa lexical category is not generated.?
Assuming that tile existing gramznar has a completeset of fllnctional words, a lexical hypothe~sis i  re-stricted to the open lexical categories, uch as noun,verb, adjective, and adverb3.2 Const ra in t  based on /meal  Boundar iesA new constraint on the violation of the boundarycondition given to phrases was introduced to avoidany collection of adja/:ent successfifl categories in rulehypothesizing.
The bomnlary condition is given byputting parentheses at both ends of a phrase, suchas a noun phrase, a verb l)hrase, and a prelmsitionalphrase.
This constraint ilters out a hylmthesis whichcrosses either end, not both ends, of a phrase.
Forexample, when parentheses are put like "\[Tile defaultblocking factor\] is \[20 blocks\]", a hyl)othesis 'VP ='eVP, NP, VE'R.BBIs"' covering "blocking factor is" isdiscarded because of the violation of the boumlary condition of a noun phrase "The defimlt blocking factor"This constraint requires the hunlan task of puttingparentheses before the hypothesis generator is invoked.hi comparison with writing a constituent structure oftile whole sentence, this work is much easier becausewe have only to give parentheses to delinite phrases.Moreover, instead of giving parentheses by hand, wecan even obtain various tagged corpora.As this constraint is also atlplieable to other con-stituents of the input sentence, it might improve theetliciency of the top-down hypothesizing algorith m.3.3 Const ra in t  based on X-bar  TheoryMost of the criteria in 3.1 are based on linguis-tic category classification but none of them com-mits itself to dealing with the rcla.tionship among thenlother node and the daughter nodes.
For example,supposing the existing granmmr does not contain arule for participial adjuncts  ill t10UU phrases, the hy-pothesizing program generates a new rewriting rule'NP ~.
VP, NP '  t?om the phrase "blocking tactor"in the sentence "The default blocking factor is 20blocks".
Ilowever, tile program also general,es otheralternative hyt)otheses from the same phrase, such as'PP ~ VP, NP',  ' INFINIg' IVI '~ ~ VP, NP',  and'THAT_CLAUS' I , /~ VP, NP',  each of which derivesa.
1lost-positional adjunct for "default" by believing"default" is a head noun of the noun phrase.
Liuguisli-cally, such combinations of nlother nodes and daughternodes are not allowed.As a general )rinciple for explaining phrase struc-tures, X-bar lheoryis widely accepted.
According toX-bar theory, a grannnar ule is (or can be convertedto) either of the following forlns, where each prime(')expresses the l)rojection level of' a head X.
The l)rojec -tion level increases as gramnlar ules are applied andX" is called a maa:imal projection of that category.
