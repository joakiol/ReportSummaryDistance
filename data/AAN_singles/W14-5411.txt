Automatic extraction of the most informative and important multimedia summary (e.g.
a rankedlist of inter-connected texts and images) from massive amounts of cross-media and cross-genre data cansignificantly save users?
time and effort that is consumed in browsing.
In this paper, we propose a novelmethod to address this new task based on automatically constructed Multi-media Information Networks(MiNets) by incorporating cross-genre knowledge and inferring implicit similarity across texts and im-ages.
The facts from MiNets are exploited in a novel random walk-based algorithm to iteratively propagateranking scores across multiple data modalities.
Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of ourMiNets-based approach and the power of cross-media cross-genre inference.1 IntroductionRecent development on web technology ?
especially on fast connection and large-scale storage systems ?
hasenabled social and news media to fulfill their jobs more efficiently in time and depth.
However, such developmentalso raises some problems such as overwhelming social media information and distracting news media contents.In emergent scenarios such as facing an incoming disaster (e.g., Hurricane Irene in 2011 or Sandy in 2012), tweetsand news are often repeatedly spread and forwarded in certain circles and contents are often overlapped by eachother.
However, browsing these messages and pages is almost unpleasant and inefficient.
Therefore, an automaticsummarization on piles of tweets and news is always necessary and welcomed, among which ranking is the mostintuitive way to inform the users about the most informative content.A passive solution is prompting the users to add more key words when typing the search query as most searchengines do.
However, without prior knowledge or due to the word limit, it is never trivial for the users to establisha satisfied ranking list for topics which attract more public attention.
Recent changes on some Google Search haveintegrated image search and adopted some heterogenous content analysis, nevertheless, the connection betweenimage and the keywords are still arbitrarily determined by the users, thus it is still far from optimal.Active solutions which attempt to summarize information only focused on single data modalities.
For example,Zanzotto et al.
(2011) provided a comprehensive comparison about summarization methods for tweets.
Zhao et al.
(2011) developed a context-sensitive topical PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) method to extract topical key phrasefrom Twitter as a way to summarize twitter content.
As a new prospective, Feng and Lapata (2010) used LDA toannotate images, but this does not firmly integrate the information across different data types.
Huang et al.
(2012)presented a tweet ranking approach but only focused on single data modality (i.e., text).Other conventional solutions towards analyzing the relationship or links between the instances have long beenproposed and applied, such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998)and VisualRank (Jing and Baluja, 2008).
Theformer is excessively used in heterogeneous networks (i.e., webpages and resources) but they are mainly based onlinkage itself.
VisualRank, which is based on PageRank, is a content-based linkage method but is confined withhomogeneous networks.Above all, our goal is to integrate cross-media inference and create the linkage among the information extractedfrom those heterogenous data.
Our novel Multi-media Information Networks (MiNets) representation initializesour idea about a basic ontology of the ranking system.The main contribution of this work is to fill in the domain gaps across different network genres and bridge themin a principled method.
In this work, we manage to discover the hidden links or structures between the heteroge-neous networks in different genres.

We can also effectively measure, share and transfer complementary information and knowledge acrossmulti-genre networks using structured correspondence.The work is presented in sections as follows.
We firstly introduce an overview of our system in Section 2.Detailed approaches in information extraction and constructing meta-information network are then followed inSection 3.
Measurement across the multimedia information are proposed in Section 4 and 5.
In Section 6 wedemonstrate the results and performance gain.2 Approach OverviewWithin the context of an event where users generate a vast amount of multi-media messages in forms of tweets andimages, we aim to provide a ranked subset of the most informative ones.
Given a set of tweets T = {t1, ..., tn},and a set of images P = {p1, ..., pm} as input, our approach provides ordered lists of the most informative tweetsor images (a.k.a objects) so that the informativeness of an object in position i is higher than or equal to that of anobject in position i + 1.
We consider the degree of informativeness of a certain object as the extent to which itprovides valuable information to people who are involved in or tracking the event in question.During emergent events, there are tight correlations between social media and web documents.
Important infor-mation shared in social media tends to be posted in web documents.
Therefore we also integrate information in aformal genre such as web documents to enhance the ranking quality of tweets and images.
It consists of two mainsub-tasks:?
Multimedia Information Network (MiNet) Construction:Construct MiNet from cross-media and cross-genre information (i.e.
tweets, images, sentences of web doc-uments).
Given a set of tweets and images on a specific topic as input, the formal genre web documents andimages from the embedded URLs in those tweets are retrieved.
Afterwards, a set of sentences and images areextracted from the web documents.
Then we exploit advanced text Information Extraction and image ConceptExtraction techniques to extract meta-information and construct the meta-information network.
Together withthree sets of heterogeneous input data, MiNet is constructed.?
MiNet-Based Information Ranking: Rank the tweets and images.
By extending and adapting Tri-HITS (Huang et al., 2012), we propose EN-Tri-HITs, an random walk-based propagation algorithm whichiteratively propagate ranking scores for sentences, tweets, and images across MiNet to refine the tweet andimage rankings.3 Meta-information NetworkWhen integrating information from different data modalities, meta-information network plays a pivotal role forrepresenting interesting concepts and relations between them.
We automatically construct the initial informa-tion networks using our state-of-the-art information extraction and image concept extraction techniques.
A meta-information network is a heterogeneous network including a set of ?information graphs?
which is formally definedas: G = {Gi: Gi= (Vi, Ei)}, where Viis the collection of concept nodes, and Eiis the collection of edgeslinking one concept to the other.
An example is depicted in Figure 1.
The meta-information network containshuman knowledge pertaining to the target domain that could improve the performance of text process and imageanalysis.
In this paper, we first construct meta-information networks separately from texts and images, and thenfuse and enrich them through effective cross-media linking methods.3.1 Information Extraction from TextsExtracting salient types of facts for a meta-information network is challenging.
In this paper we tackle this problemfrom two angles to balance the trade-off between quality and granularity/annotation cost.
On one hand, to revealdeep semantics in meta-information network, we focus on achieving high-quality extraction for pre-defined fine-grained types such as those in NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE)1.
For example, a ?Person/Individual?node may include attributes such as ?Birth-Place?, and a ?Organization/Employee?
node may include attributessuch as ?City-of-Headquarter?.
These two nodes may be connected via a ?Employment/End-Position?
link.We apply an Information Extraction (IE) system (Li et al., 2013) to extract entities, relations and events definedin ACE2005.
There are 7 types of entities, 18 types of relations and 33 types of events.
This system is basedon a joint framework using structured perceptron with efficient beam-search and incorporating diverse lexical,syntactic, semantic and ontological features.
We convert the IE output into the graph structured representation ofmeta-information network by mapping each entity as a node, and link entity nodes by semantic relations or eventsthey are involved.
For example, the relations between entities are naturally mapped to links in the meta-informationnetwork, such as the ?employment?
relation between ?Bill Read?
and ?Hurricane Center?.
In addition, if an event1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/ace/75floodMultimedia information NetworksMeta-information NetworksORGflooding from Irene killed one person Puerto RicoBill Read Hurricane Center saidEmploymentSpeakerAgent SubjectClause SubjectPlaceAgentVictimstormWikipediaVerifiedby wiki Verifiedby wiki Verifiedby wikiVerified Entity ConceptsTweets Sentences of web documents ImagesContents Structured informationPER GPEEvent TriggerPredicate Predicate Noun phrase Noun phraseExample:SRLIE concepttypeConceptfrom image Concept from imageFigure 1: An example of meta-information network.
Sentence: ?Bill Read, Hurricane Center director, said thatflooding from Irene killed at least one person in Puerto Rico?argument is an entity, we also add an ?Event Argument?
link between the event trigger and the entity, such as thelink between ?Irene?
and ?killed?.On the other hand, in order to enrich the meta-information network, we extract more coarse-grained salientfact types based on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Pradhan et al., 2008).
For example, given the sentence ?InNorth Carolina, 10 counties are being evacuated.
?, the ?evacuation?
event is not included in ACE.
However, theSRL system can successfully detect the predicate (?evacuated?)
and its semantic roles (?10 counties?
and ?NorthCarolina?).
These argument heads and predicates are added into the meta-information network as vertices, andedges are added between each predicate-argument pairs.We merge entity mentions across tweets and web documents based on a cross-document entity clustering systemdescribed in (Chen and Ji, 2011).
Moreover, for the same type of nodes from the SRL system, we also merge themby string matching across documents.3.2 Concept Extraction from ImagesWe also developed a concept modeling approach by extending the similar framework in previous work (Tsai et al.,2012), Probabilistic Logical Tree (PLT), to extract semantic concepts from images.
PLT integrates the logical andstatistical inferences in a unifying framework where the existing primitive concepts are connected into a potentiallyunlimited vocabulary of high-level concepts by basic logical operations.
In contrast, most existing image conceptextraction algorithms either only learn a flat correlative concept structure, or a simple hierarchical structure withoutlogical connections.With an efficient statistical learning algorithm, the complex concepts in upper level of PLT are modeled uponsome logically connected primitive concepts.
This statistical learning approach is very flexible, where each conceptin PLT can be modeled from distinctive feature spaces with the most suitable feature descriptors (e.g., visualfeatures such as color and shape for scenery concepts).For our case study on ?Hurricane Irene?
scenario, we apply this algorithm to extract the hierarchical concepttrees with roots ?flood?
or ?storm?
from all the images in web documents whose URLs are contained in tweets.The main problem is the classifications of the concepts such that it may be properly be placed onto an ontology.In order to enrich the hierarchy, we seek to classify these linkages through the use of the semi-structured andstructured data that exists on Wikipedia.
We use pattern matching to extract is-a relations from the first paragraphsof Wikipedia articles.
For example, starting from our initial concept ?Hurricane Irene?, we can find its is-a relationwith ?Tropical Cyclone?, and then climb up one more level to ?Storm?
where we can further mine lower conceptssuch as ?Tornado?
and ?Snow Storm?.764 Multi-media Information NetworksA Multimedia Information Network (MINet) is a structured collection made up of a set of multimedia documents(e.g., texts and images) and links between these documents.
Each link corresponds to a specific relationshipbetween nodes, such as hyperlinks between web documents or similarity links between tweets.
In this paper, weconstruct our MINet based on two forms of contents from different domains: tweets, web documents (plain texts)and images.4.1 Within-media Linking4.1.1 Text-Text SimilarityTaking web document for example, we construct the meta-information network G = {Gi: Gi= (Vi, Ei)} for allweb documents D, in which each web document di?
D corresponds to Gi.
Given the meta-information networkG, we compute the weight of each vertex vj?
Vias weightvj=nf(vj,d)AV E(D),where nf(vj, d) is the mention number of node vjappearing in a document d and AV E(D) is the averagenumber of mentions in a document d, which is defined as AV E(D) =?d?Dconcept mentions in d|D|.Similarly, we define the weight of each link ek?
Eias weightek=nf(ek,d)AV E(D), where nf(ek, d) is the mentionnumber of the node ekin a document d and AV E(D) is the average number of mentions in a document d, whichis defined as AV E(D) =?d?Drelation mentions in d|D|.If two edges share the same type and link nodes corresponding to the same tokens, we consider them as twomentions involved in a relation.
Based on the weight of each concept mention and relation mention, we count theirfrequencies and transform them into vectors.
Finally, we compute cosine similarity between every two vectors.4.1.2 Image-Image SimilarityWe extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features (Dalal and Triggs, 2005) from patches in images andapply Hierarchical Gaussianization (Zhou et al., 2009) to those HOG feature vectors.
We learn a Gaussian mixturemodel (GMM) to obtain the statistics of the patches of an image by adapting the distribution of the extracted HOGfeatures from these image patches and each image is represented by a super-vector.
Based on the obtained imagerepresentation, the image-image similarity is simply a cosine similarity between two HG super-vectors.4.2 Cross-media LinkingIn order to obtain cross-media similarity, we propose a method based on transfer learning technique (Qi et al.,2012).
Given a set of m points [p1, p2, .
.
.
, pm] in the source (image) domain P , a set of n points [t1, t2, .
.
.
, tn]in the target (text) domain T , and a set of N corresponding pairs C = {(pai, tbi}Ni=1in these two domains, we aimto find a cross-media similarity function:G(p, t) = `((Up)T(V t)) = `(pTSt)), (1)where U and V are the linear embedding of P and T , respectively.
S = UTV is the cross-domain similaritymatrix and `(?)
=11+e?
?is the logistic sigmoid function.The key to S in Equation 1 is to solve the optimization problem blow:minS?Ls(S) + ?
?Ld(S) + ???
(S), (2)where?Ls(S) =?
(x,y)?Clog(1 + exp(?pTSt)), and??
(S) = ?S?
?is the nuclear norm that is the surrogate ofthe matrix rank.
Also, we have?Ld(S) =12?KP(p, p?
)dT(p, p?)
+12?KT(t, t?
)dP(t, t?
),where K(?, ?)
is the similarity matrix among the points in a single domain and d(?, ?)
defines the distance betweentwo points due to the transfer.Taking one step further, we have?Ld(S) = tr(LTQT(S)TKPQP(S)) + tr(LXQP(S)TKTQT(S)),where LPand LTare the Laplacian matrices for KPand KT, respectively.To solve the optimization problem (2) with nuclear norm regularization we follow the proximal gradient method(Toh and Yun, 2010) with the following gradients:5?Ls(S) = P (JC?H)PT,5?Ld(S) = P ((KPQPLT+ LPQTKT) ?H)PT(3)77JCis an m ?
n matrix with its (i, j)-th entry 1 if (pi, tj) ?
C, otherwise 0.
H is also an m ?
n matrix whose(i, j)-th entry where Hij= `?
(pTiStj).Hence we have5?L(S) = P (G ?H)TT, (4)where G = JC+ ?KPQPLT+ ?LPQTKT.
With the gradient in (4), one can solve the problem (2) using theproximal gradient method.5 MiNet-Based Information Ranking: EN-Tri-HITs5.1 Initializing Ranking Scores1 Input: A set of tweets (T ), and images (P ) and web documents (W ) on a given topic.2 Output: Ranking scores (St) for T and (Sp) for P .1: Use TextRank to compute initial ranking scores S0pfor P ,S0tfor T and S0wfor W ;2: Construct multimedia information networks across P , Tand W ;3: k ?

Inthis paper, we adapted PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Jing and Baluja, 2008) tocompute initial ranking scores in tweet-only and image-only networks where edges between tweets or images aredetermined by their cosine similarity.The ranking score is computed as follows:S(Vi) = (1?
d) + d ?
?Vj?In(Vi)wji?Vk?Out(Vj)wjkS(Vj),where Viis a vertex with S(Vi) as its ranking score; In(Vi) and Out(Vi) are the incoming edge set and outgoingedge set of Vi, respectively; wijis the weight for the edge between two vertices Viand Vj.
An edge links twovertices that represent text units when their cosine similarity of shared content exceeds or equals to a predefinedthreshold ?t.5.2 Random Walk on Multimedia Information NetworksWe introduce a novel algorithm to incorporate both initial ranking scores and global evidence from multimediainformation networks.
It propagates ranking scores across MiNets iteratively.
Our algorithm is a natural extensionof Tri-HITS (Huang et al., 2012) based on the mutual reinforcement to boost linked objects.By extending Tri-HITS, we develop enhanced Tri-HITS (EN-Tri-HITs) to handle multimedia information net-works with three types of objects: Tweets (T ), sentences of web documents (W ) and images (P ).
EN-Tri-HITsis able to handle more complicated network structure with more links.
Given the similarity matrices Mtw(be-tween tweets and sentences of web documents), Mwp(between sentences of web documents and images) andMtp(between tweets and images), and initial ranking scores of S0(p), S0(t) and S0(w), we aim to refine the initialranking scores and obtain the final ranking scores S(w), S(t) and S(p).
Starting from images S(p), the updateprocess considers both the initial score S0(p) and the propagation from connected tweets S(t) and web documentsS(w), which can be expressed as:?Sw(pj) =?i?WmwpijS(wi),?St(pj) =?k?TmtpkjS(tk),S(pj) = (1?

[0, 1] (?wp+ ?tp?
1) are the parameters to balance between initial and propagated rankingscores.
Similar to Tri-HITS, EN-Tri-HITS normalizes the propagated ranking scores?Sw(pi) and?St(pi).Similarly, we define the propagations from images and web documents to tweets as follows:?Sp(tk) =?i?PmptikS(pi),?Sw(tk) =?j?WmwtjkS(wj),S(tk) = (1?

?pt)S0(tk) + ?wt?Sp(tk)?k?Sp(tk)+ ?pt?Sw(tk)?k?Sw(tk), (6)where Mptis the transpose of Mtp, ?ptand ?wtare parameters to balance between initial and propagated rankingscores.Each sentence of web documents S(wj) may be influenced by the propagation from both tweets and images:?St(wi) =?k?TmtwkiS(tk),?Sp(wi) =?i?PmpwjiS(pj),S(wi) = (1?

?pw)S0(wi) + ?tw?St(wi)?i?St(wi)+ ?pw?Sp(wi)?i?Sp(wi), (7)where Mpwis the transpose of Mwp, ?twand ?pware parameters to balance between initial and propagatedranking scores.Algorithm 1 summarizes En-Tri-HITS.6 Experiments6.1 Data and Scoring MetricCurrently there are no information ranking related benchmark data sets publicly available, therefore we build ourown data set and network ontology.We crawled 3471 tweets during a three-hour period and extracted key phrases from these tweets, then we usethe key phrases as image search queries.
The image search queries are submitted to Bing Image Search API andwe take the top 10 images for each query.
We extract a 512-d GIST feature from each image for meta informationtraining.
For image similarity metrics, we resize images to a maximum of 240 ?
240 and segmented into patcheswith three different sizes (16, 25 and 31) by a 6-pixel step size.
A 128-d Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)feature is extracted from each patch and followed by a PCA dimension reduction to 80-d.
The size of dimensionof the final feature vector for each image is 42,496.We create the ground truth based on human assessment of informativeness on a 5-star likert scale, with grade 5as the most informative and 1 as the least informative.
Table 1 presents an overview on our data sets.
We conduct3-fold cross-validation for our experiments.To evaluate tweet ranking, we use nDCG as our evaluation metric (J?arvelin and Kek?al?ainen, 2002), whichconsiders both the informativeness and the position of a tweet:nDCG(?, k) =1|?||?|?i=1DCGikIDCGik, DCGik=k?j=12relij?
1log(1 + j),where ?
is the set of documents in the test set, with each document corresponding to an hour of tweets in our case,relijis the human-annotated label for the tweet j in the document i, and IDCGikis the DCG score of the idealranking.
The average nDCG score for the top k tweets is: Avg@k =?ki=1nDCG(?, i)/k.
To favor diversity oftop ranked tweets, redundant tweets are penalized to lower down the final score.796.2 Impact of Cross-media InferenceTable 2 and Figure 2 present the image ranking results.
The results indicate that methods integrating heterogeneousnetworks outperform the baseline of image ranking (0.421).
When web documents are aligned with images (row1), the ranking quality improves significantly, proving that web documents can help detect informative images byadding support from text media of formal genre.
However, the text media of informal genre, such as tweets, almostcannot help improve the ranking performance.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 00 .

When tweets are aligned with web documents, the ranking quality improves significantly, proving thatweb documents can help infer informative tweets by adding support from a formal genre.
The fact that tweets withlow initial ranking scores are aligned with web documents helps promote their ranking positions.
For example,the ranking of the tweet ?Hurricane Irene: City by City Forecasts http://t.co/x1t122A?
is improved compared toTextRank, benefitting from the fact that 10 retrieved web documents are about this topic.6.4 Remaining Error AnalysisEnhanced Tri-HITS shows encouraging improvements in ranking quality with respect to a state-of-the-art modelsuch as TextRank.
However, there are still some issues to be addressed for further improvements.
(i) Long tweets preferred.
We tracked tweets containing the keywords ?Hurricane?
and ?Irene?.
Using such aquery might also return tweets that are not related to the event being followed.
This may occur either becausethe terms are ambiguous, or because of spam being injected into trending conversations to make it visible.
Forexample, the tweet ?Hurricane Kitty: http://t.co/cdIexE3?
is an advertisement, which is not topically related toIrene.
(ii) Deep semantic analysis of the content, especially for images.
We rely on distinct terms to refer to thesame concept.
More extensive semantic analyses of text can help identify those terms, possibly enhancing thepropagation process.
For example, we can explore existing text dictionaries such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) tomine synonym/hypernym/hyponym relations, and Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992) to mine other types ofrelations in order to enrich the concepts extracted from images.7 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we propose a comprehensive information ranking approach which facilitates measurement on cross-media/cross-genre informativeness based on a novel multi-media information network representation MiNet.
Weestablish links via information extraction method from text and images and verification with Wikipedia.
In ad-dition, we propose similarity measurement on intra-media and cross-media using transfer learning techniques.We also introduce a novel En-Tri-Hits algorithm to evaluate the ranking scores across MiNet.
Experiments havedemonstrated that our cross-media/cross-genre ranking method is able to significantly boost the performance ofmulti-media tweet ranking.
In the future, we aim to focus on enhancing the quality of concept extraction byexploiting cross-media inference that goes beyond simple fusion.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement No.
