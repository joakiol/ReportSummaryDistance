Whilethe domain-oriented semantic structures aredirect targets of Text Mining (TM), their ex-traction from text is not straghtforward dueto the diversity of linguistic expressions.
Theextraction of linguistically-oriented semacticsis more straghtforward, and has been studiedindependentely of specific domains.
In or-der to find a use of the domain-independentresearch achievements for TM, we aim atlinking classes of the two types of seman-tics.
The classes were connected by analyz-ing linguistically-oriented semantics of the ex-pressions that mention one biological class.With the obtained relationship between theclasses, we discuss a link between TM andlinguistically-oriented semantics.1 IntroductionThis paper compares the linguistically-oriented anddomain-oriented semantics of the GENIA event cor-pus, and suggests a factor for utilizing NLP tech-niques for Text Mining (TM) in the bio-medical do-main.The increasing number of scientific articles in thebio-medical domain has contributed in drawing con-siderable attention to NLP-based TM.
An impor-tant step in NLP-based TM is obtaining the domain-oriented semantics of sentences, as shown at the bot-tom of figure 1.
The BioInfer (Pyysalo et al, 2007)and the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al, 2008) pro-vide annotations of such semantic structures on col-lections of bio-medical articles.
Domain-orientedsemantic structures are valuable assets because theirrepresentation suits information needs in the do-main; however, the extraction of such structures isdifficult due to the large gap between the text andthese structures.On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics from text has long been studiedin computational linguistics, and has recently beenformalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea andJurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction(Baker et al, 2007)(Surdeanu et al, 2008).
Seman-tic structures in such tasks are exemplified in themiddle of figure 1.
The linguistically-oriented se-mantic structures are easier to extract, although theinformation is not practical to the domain.We aim at relating linguistically-oriented framesof semantics with domain-oriented classes, thusmaking a step forward in utilizing the computa-tional linguistic resources for the bio-medical TM.Of all the differences in the two type of seman-tics, we focused on the fact that the former framesare more sensitive to the perspective imposed bythe sentence writer.
In the right hand-side exam-ple of figure 1, the linguistically-oriented structuretreats PBMC, a cell entity, as an agent; however thebio-medical structure reflects the scientific view thatthere are no agents, objects acting with intention, inbio-molecular phenomena.As a preliminary investigation, we selectedfour representative classes of bio-molecular phe-nomena; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion,and Gene expression, and investigated domain-oriented annotations for the classes in the GENIA162?, whereas in many other cell types, NF-kappa B TRANSLOCATES from cytosol to nucleus as a result of ?

Expressions mentioning the fourclasses were examined and manually classified intolinguistically-oriented frames, represented by thosedefined in FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998).
FN framesassociated to a bio-molecular event class constitute alist of possible perspectives in mentioning phenom-ena of the class.The rest of this paper is structured in the fol-lowing way: Section 2 reviews the existing workon semantic structures and expression varieties inthe bio-medical domain, and provides a compari-son to our work.
In section 3, we describe the GE-NIA event corpus, and the FrameNet frames used aslinguistically-oriented classes in our investigation.Sections 4 and 5 explain the methods and results ofthe corpus investigation; in particular the sections in-vestigate how the linguistic frames were associatedto the domain-oriented classes of semantics.
Finally,we provide discussion and conclusion in section 6and 7.2 Related WorkExisting work on semantics approached domain-oriented semantic structures from linguistically-oriented semantics.
In contrast, our approach usesdomain-oriented semantics to find the linguistic se-mantics that represent them.
We believe that the twodifferent approaches could complement each other.The PASbio(Wattarujeekrit et al, 2004) pro-poses Predicate Argument Structures (PASs), a typeof linguistically-oriented semantic structures, fordomain-specific lexical items, based on PASs de-fined in PropBank(Wattarujeekrit et al, 2004) andNomBank(Meyers et al, 2004).
The PASs are de-fined per lexical item, and is therefore distinct from abiologically-oriented representation of events.
(Co-hen et al, 2008) investigated syntactic alternationsof verbs and their nominalized forms which oc-curred in the PennBioIE corpus(Kulick et al, 2004),whilst keeping PASs of the PASBio in their minds.The BioFrameNet(Dolbey et al, 2006) is an at-tempt to extend the FrameNet with specific framesto the bio-medical domain, and to apply the framesto corpus annotation.
Our attempts were similar, inthat both were: 1) utilizing the FN frames or theirextensions to classify mentions of biological events,and 2) relating the frames and the FEs (roles of par-ticipants) with classes in domain ontologies; e.g.
theGene Ontology(Ashburner et al, 2000).As far as the authors know, it is the first at-tempt to explicitly address the problem of linkinglinguistically-oriented and domain-oriented framesof semantics.
However, it has been indirectly stud-ied through works on TM or Relation Extractionusing linguistically-oriented semantic structures asfeatures, such as in the case with (Harabagiu et al,2005).3 Corpora?We used domain-oriented annotations of the GE-NIA event corpus and linguistically-oriented framesdefined in FrameNet (FN), to link domain-orientedand linguistically-oriented frames of semantics.
Webriefly describe these resources next.163Mo?nReleasingGe?gA?chingBeing_locatedBecomingEventStateGENIA?eventBiological_processViral_life_cycleCellular_processPhysiological_processCell_adhesionCell_communica?nLocaliza?nBindingMetabolismDNA_metabolismGene_expressionCrea?gBeing_a?chedFigure 2: The resulting relationship between linguistically-oriented andbiologically-oriented frames.The GENIA event corpus consists of 1,000 Med-line abstracts; that is, 9,372 sentences annotatedwith domain-oriented semantic structures.
The an-notation was completed for all mentions of biolog-ical events, and resulted in 6,114 identified events.Examples of annotated event structures are shown atthe bottom of figure 1.
Each structure has attributestype and themes, which respectively show the bio-logical class of the mentioned event and phrases ex-pressing the event participants.
The event classes aredefined based on the terms in the Gene Ontology.For example, the Localization class in the GENIAevent corpus is defined as an equivalent of the GOterm Localization (GO0051179).
The event classi-fications used in the corpus are depicted in the lefthand-side of figure 2.
Arrows in the figure depictthe inheritance relations defined in the GENIA eventontology.
For instance, the Localization class is de-fined as a type of Physiological process.
Each ofthe annotated structures has additional attributes thatpoint phrases that the annotator of the structure usedas a clue.
Among the attributes, the clueType at-tribute shows a clue phrase to the event class.
In ourinvestigation, the attribute was treated as a predicate,or an equivalent of the lexical unit in the FN.FN is a network of frames that are arelinguistically-oriented classifications of semantics.A FN frame is defined as ?a script-like conceptualstructure that describes a particular type of situation,object, or event and the participants and proposi-tions involved in it,?
and is associated with words,or lexical units, evoking the frame.
For instance, theverbs move, go and fly are lexical units of the Mo-tion frame, and they share the same semantic struc-ture.
Each FN frame has annotation examples form-ing an attestation of semantic overlap between thelexical units.
Additionally, FN defines several typesof frame-frame relations; e.g.
inheritance, prece-dence, subframe, etc.
The right hand-side of figure2 shows some FN frames and inheritance relation-ships between them.
The FN provides linguistically-oriented classifications of event mentions based onsurface expressions, and also shows abstract rela-tions between the frames.4 Additional AnnotationOur aim is to link linguistically-oriented anddomain-oriented frames of the bio-medical text?s se-mantics.
A major problem in this task was that therewere no annotated corpora with both types of se-mantic structures.
Therefore, we decided to concen-trate on the mentions of a few classes of biologicalphenomena, and to annotate samples of the mentionswith linguistically-oriented structures conforming to164Freq.

First, we collected linguistic expressions thatmention each of the selected GENIA event classesfrom the GENIA event corpus.
We then sampledand annotated them with their linguistically-orientedsemantics which conformed to the FrameNet.4.1 Target Classes and KeywordsWe concentrated mainly on the mentions of four GE-NIA classes; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion,and Gene expression.
Gene expression, Binding,and Localization are three of the most frequent fourclasses in the GENIA event corpus.1 Binding andLocalization are the two most primitive molecularevents.
The Cell adhesion class was included as acomparison for the Binding class.Counting keywords for mentioning events wasclose to automatic.
We extracted phrases pointedby a clueType attribute from each event structure.We then tokenized the phrases, performed a simplestemming on the tokens, and counted the resultingwords.
The stemming process simply replaced eachinflected word to its stem by consulting a small listof inflected words with their stems.
Manual workwas only used in making the small list.4.2 FN AnnotationA major challenge encountered in annotating a sam-pled expression with a semantic structure conform-ing to FN, was in the assignment of a FN frame to1Except correlation and regulation classes which express re-lational information rather than events.the mention.
Our decision was based on the follow-ing four points: 1) keywords used in the mention, 2)description of FN frames, 3) syntactic positions ofthe event participants, and 4) frame-frame relations.The first indicates that a FN frame became a can-didate frame for the mention, if the keyword in themention is a lexical unit of the FN frame.
FN framesand their lexical units could be easily checked byconsulting the FN dictionary.
If there were no en-tries for the keyword in the dictionary, synonyms orwords in the keyword?s definition were used.
For ex-ample, the verb translocate has no entries in the FNdictionary, and the frames for verbs such as movewere used instead.For the second point, we discarded FN frames thatare either evoked by a completely different sense ofthe keyword, or too specific of a non-biological sit-uations.Before we assigned a FN frame to each mention,we manually examined the syntactic positions of allevent participants present in the sampled GENIAmentions.
Combinations of the syntactic positionand event participants observed for a keyword werecompared with sample annotations of the candidateFN frames.We checked frame-frame relations between thecandidate frames, because they can be regardedas evidence that shows that the conception of theframes is related.
For our aim, it was sufficient tochoose a set of frames that best describes the differ-ent perspectives for mentioning one type of molecu-lar phenomena.
Even when some keywords seemedto be dissimilar in the three points mentioned above,165Freq.

The resulting relationshipsbetween FN frames and the four GENIA classesdemonstrate a gap between linguistically-orientedand domain-oriented classification of events, asshown in figure 2.The relations can be explained by decomposing itinto two cases: 1) 1-to-n mappings, and 2) n-to-1mappings.
The n-to-n mapping from GENIA to FNcan then be regarded as a mix of the two cases.
Inthe following sections, the two cases are describedin detail.
Further, we show conversion examples ofa FN structure to a GENIA event structure, whichwere supported by the obtained GENIA participant-FN participant relations.5.1 1-to-N Mapping: Different Perspectives onthe Same PhenomenaA 1-to-n mapping from GENIA to FN can be ex-plained as the case where the same molecular phe-nomena are expressed from different perspectives.5.1.1 Binding Expressed in Multiple framesThe Binding class in GENIA is defined as?the selective, often stoichiometric interaction of amolecule with one or more specific sites on an-other molecule.?
We associated the class with threeframes, and two frames of the three, Attaching andBecoming frames, represent different perspectivesfor mentioning the class.
The Being attached frameshares the same conception as Attaching, but ex-presses states instead of events.
See table 1 for key-words of the class, and the frames assigned to thewords.Attaching: In the perspective represented by thisframe, a binding phenomenon was recognized as aevent in which protein molecules were simply at-tached to one another.

(PubMed ID 10191934, Event ID E5)This type of expression was possible because a prod-uct of a binding often obtains a different function-ality, and can be treated as a different type of en-tity.
Note that this frame was not associated with theCell adhesion class described in section 5.2.166ACB?Figure 3: A schematic figure of translocation.Being attached: Annotators recognized a proteinbinding event from the sentence below, which basi-cally mentions a state of the NF-kB.In T cells and T cell lines, [NF-kBItem]is BOUND [to a cytoplasmic proteic in-hibitor, the IkBGoal].
(PubMed ID 1958222, Event ID E2, E102)Although this type of expression shares a similarpoint of view with the Attaching frame, we classi-fied these expressions into the Being attached framein order to demonstrate cases in which a prerequisiteBinding event was inferred from a state.5.1.2 Translocation Expressed in MultipleFramesThe Localization class in the GENIA corpus is de-fined as a class for ?any process by which a cell, asubstance, or a cellular entity, such as a protein com-plex or organelle, is transported to, and/or main-tained in a specific location.?
Sampled expressionsof the class separated into mentions of a process, bywhich an entity was transported to a specific loca-tion, and those of the process in which an entity wasmaintained in a specific location.
We concentrate onthe former in this section, and describe the latter insection 5.1.3.We associated the frames: Motion, Releasing andGetting with what we call translocation events, orLocalization events in which an entity was trans-ported to a specific location.
Figure 3 provides aschematic representation of a translocation event.Each of the three frames had a different perspectivein expressing the translocations.
See table 2 for key-words of the frames.Motion: This group consists of expressions cen-tered on the translocated entities of the translocation- namely, B in the figure 3.

(PubMed ID 9285527, Event ID E10)167To summarize, we observed three groups of ex-pressions that mention translocation events, andeach group represented different perspectives tomention the events.
Each of the groups and the as-sociated frame seemed similar, in that they sharedsimilar keywords and possible syntactic positions toexpress the event participant.5.1.3 Localization excluding TranslocationExpressed in Multiple FramesLocalization events excluding translocations wereexpressed in the Being located and Creating frames.Being located: This group consists of expressionsthat simply mention an entity in a specific location.?

This type of overlap be-tween the Localization and Gene expression is ex-plained in section 5.2.25.2 N-to-1 Mapping: Same Conception forDifferent Molecular PhenomenonIn contrast to the cases described in section 5.1, thesame conception could be applied to different bio-logical phenomena.5.2.1 Shared Conception for Binding andCell adhesionMolecular events classified into Binding andCell adhesion shared the conception that two enti-ties were attached to each other.
However, types ofthe entities involved are different.

Our preliminary result illustrates the gap be-tween the two type of semantics, and a relationshipbetween them.
We discuss development of a TextMining (TM) system, in association with the extrac-tion of linguistically-oriented semantics, which hasbeen studied independently of TM.First, our result would show that TM involves atleast two qualitatively different tasks.
One task isrelated to our results; that is, recognizing equiva-lent events which are expressed from different per-spectives, and hence expressed by using differentlinguistic frames, and at the same time distinguish-ing event mentions which share the same linguisticframe but belong to different domain classes.
Ourinvestigation indicates that this task is mainly depen-dent on domain knowledge and how a phenomenoncan be conceptualized.
Another task of TM is the ex-traction of linguistically-oriented semantics, whichbasically maps various syntactic realizations to theshared structures.
In order to develop a TM system,we need to solve the two difficult tasks.Second, TM could benefit from linguistically-oriented frames by using them as an intermediat-ing layer between text and domain-oriented infor-mation.
The domain-oriented semantic structures,which is a target of TM, are inevitably dependenton the domain.
On the other hand, the extraction oflinguistically-oriented semantics from text is less de-pendent.
Therefore, using the linguistically-orientedstructure could be favorable to domain portability ofa TM system.Our aim was explicitly linking linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented semantics of the bio-molecular articles, and the preliminary result showthe possibility of the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics contributing to TM.
Further in-v tigation of the relationship would be a importantstep forward for TM in the bio-molecular domain.Our investigation was preliminary.
For exam-ple, conversions from FN structures to GENIA eventstructures, depicted in figures 4 and 5, were basedon manual investigation.
Further, they were attestedby limited samples in the corpus.
For our results tocontribute to a TM system, evaluation of the conver-sions and automatic extraction of such conversionsmust be considered.7 ConclusionThis paper presents a relationship of domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented frames of se-mantics, obtained by an investigation of the GE-NIA event corpus.
In the investigation, we anno-tated sample sentences from the GENIA event cor-pus with linguistically-oriented semantic structuresas those of FrameNet, and compared them withdomain-oriented semantic annotations that the cor-pus originally possesses.
The resulting relationsbetween the domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented frames suggest that mentions of a bio-logical phenomenon could be realized in a num-ber of linguistically-oriented frames, and thatthe linguistically-oriented frames represent possibleperspectives in mentioning the phenomenon.
Theresulting relations would illustrate a challenge indeveloping a Text Mining system, and would indi-cate importance of linguistically-oriented frames asan intermediating layer between text and domain-oriented information.
Our future plan includesevaluation of our conversions from a linguistically-oriented to a domain-oriented structure, and auto-matic extraction of such conversions.169ReferencesM.
