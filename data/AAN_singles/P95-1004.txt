Handling of various Semitic er-ror problems is illustrated, with referenceto Arabic and Syriac examples.
The modelhandles errors vocalisation, diacritics, pho-netic syncopation and morphographemicidiosyncrasies, in addition to Damerau er-rors.
A complementary correction strategyfor morphologically sound but morphosyn-tactically ill-formed words is outlined.1 In t roduct ionSemitic is known amongst computational linguists,in particular computational morphologists, for itshighly inflexional morphology.
Its root-and-patternphenomenon ot only poses difficulties for a mor-phological system, but also makes error detectiona difficult task.
This paper aims at presenting amorphographemic model which can cope with bothissues.The following convention has been adopted.
Mor-phemes are represented in braces, { }, surface(phonological) forms in solidi, / / ,  and orthographicstrings in acute brackets, () .
In examples of gram-mars, variables begin with a capital letter.
Cs de-note consonants, Vs denote vowels and a bar denotescomplement.
An asterisk, *, indicates ill-formedstrings.The difficulties in morphological nalysis and er-ror detection in Semitic arise from the followingfacts:* Supported by a British Telecom Scholarship, ad-ministered by the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust inconjunction with the Foreign sad Commonwealth Office.t Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from StJohn's College.Non-L inear i ty  A Semitic stem consists of aroot  and a vowel melody,  arranged accord-ing to a canonical pattern.
For example,Arabic/kutt ib/  'caused to write - perfect pas-sive' is composed from the root morpheme{ktb} 'notion of writing' and the vowel melodymorpheme {ul} 'perfect passive'; the two arearranged according to the pattern morpheme{CVCCVC} 'causative'.
This phenomenon isanalysed by (McCarthy, 1981) along the finesof autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976).The analysis appears in (1).
1(1)DERIVATION OF /kuttib/u iI I /kut t ib / - -  C V C C V Ca v ik t b?
Vocal isation Orthographically, Semitic textsappear in three forms: (i) consonantal  textsdo not incorporate any short vowels but ma-ttes lectionis, 2 e.g.
Arabic (ktb) for /katab/,/ kut ib /and/kutub/ ,  but (kaatb) for/kaatab/and /kaatib/; (ii) part ia l ly  voealised textsincorporate some short vowels to clarify am-biguity, e.g.
(kutb) for /kutib/ to distinguishit from /katab/; and (iii) voeal ised texts in-corporate full vocalisation, e.g.
(tadahra\]) for/tada ay.1We have used the CV model to describe pattern mor-phemes instead of prosodic terms because of its familiar-ity in the computational linguistics literature.
For theuse of moraic sad affLxational models in handling Arabicmorphology computationally, see (Kiraz,).2'Mothers of reading', these are consonantal letterswhich play the role of long vowels, sad are representedin the pattern morpheme by VV (e.g.
/aa/, /uu/,/ii/).
Mattes lectionis cannot be omitted from the or-thographic string.24?
Vowel and  Diacr i t ic  Shifts Semitic lan-guages employ a large number of diacritics torepresent enter alia short vowels, doubled let-ters, and nunation.
3 Most editors allow the userto enter such diacritics above and below letters.To speed data entry, the user usually enters thebase characters (say a paragraph) and then goesback and enters the diacritics.
A common mis-take is to place the cursor one extra positionto the left when entering diacritics.
This re-sults in the vowels being shifted one position,e.g.
*(wkatubi) instead of (wakutib).?
Vocalisms The quality of the perfect and im-perfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semiticverbs are idiosyncratic.
For example, the Syr-iac root {ktb} takes the perfect vowel a, e.g./ktab/, while the root {nht} takes the vowel e,e.g.
/nhet/.
It is common among learners tomake mistakes such as */kteb/or */nhat/.?
Phonetic Syncopation A consonantal seg-ment may be omitted from the phonetic surfaceform, but maintained in the orthographic sur-face from.
For example, Syriac (md/nt~)'city' ispronounced/mdit~/.
* Id iosyncras ies  The application of a mor-phographemic rule may have constraints as onwhich lexical morphemes it may or may not ap-ply.
For example, the glottal stop \[~\] at the endof a stem may become \[w\] when followed by therelative adjective morpheme {iyy}, as in Arabic/ samaaP+iyy / -+/samaawiyy / 'heaven ly ' ,  but/hawaaP+iyy / -~/hawaa~iyy / 'o f  air'.
* Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals,diminutives and deverbal nouns, the user mayenter a morphologically sound, but morphosyn-tactically ill-formed word.
We shall discuss thisin more detail in section 4.
4To the above, one adds language-independent issuesin spell checking such as the four Damerau trans-formations: omission, insertion, transposition andsubstitution (Damerau, 1964).2 A Morphographemic  Mode lThis section presents a morphographemic modelwhich handles error detection in non-linear strings.3When indefinite, nouns and adjectives end in a pho-netic In\] which is represented in the orthographic formby special diacritics.4For other issues with respect to syntactic dependen-cies, see (Abduh, 1990).Subsection 2.1 presents the formalism used, and sub-section 2.2 describes the model.2.1 The  Formal i smIn order to handle the non-linear phenomenon ofArabic, our model adopts the two-level formalismpresented by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993), with themulti tape extensions in (Kiraz, 1994).
Their for-realism appears in (2).
(2)TwO-LEVEL FORMALISMLLC - LEX RLCLSC - SURF - RSCwhereLLCLEXRLCLSCSURFRSC= left lexical context= lexical form= right lexical context= left surface context= surface form= right surface contextThe special symbol * is a wildcard matching any con-text, with no length restrictions.
The operatorcaters for obligatory rules.
A lexical string maps toa surface string if\[ they can be partitioned into pairsof lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair islicenced by a =~ or ~ rule, and no partition violatesa ?~ rule.
In the multi-tape version, lexical expres-sions (i.e.
LLC,  LEX and RLC)  are n-tuple of regu-lax expressions of the form (xl, x2, .
.
.
,  xn): the / thexpression refers to symbols on the ith tape; a nillslot is indicated by ~.5 Another extension is givingLLC the ability to contain ellipsis, .
.
.
, which in-dicates the (optional) omission from LLC of tuples,provided that the tuples to the left o f .
.
.
are the firstto appear on the left of LEx.In our morphographemic model, we add a similarformalism for expressing error rules (3).
(3)ERROR FORMALISMErrSurf =~ Surf{ PLC-  PRC } wherePLC = partition left context(has been done)PRC = partition right context(yet to be done)5Our implementation interprets rules directly; hence,we allow ~.
If the rules were to be compiled into au-tomata, a genuine symbol, e.g.
0, must be used.
For thecompilation of our formalism into automata, see (Kirazand Grimley-Evans, 1995).25The error rules capture the correspondence b -tween the error surface and the correct surface, giventhe surrounding partition into surface and lexicalcontexts.
They happily utilise the multi-tape formatand integrate seamlessly into morphological naly-sis.
PLC and PRC above are the left and right con-texts of both the lexical and (correct) surface levels.Only the =~ is used (error is not obligatory).2.2 The Model2.2 .1  F ind ing  the  er rorMorphological nalysis is first called with the as-sumption that the word is free of errors.
If this fails,analysis is attempted again without he 'no error' re-striction.
The error rules are then considered whenordinary morphological rules fail.
If no error rulessucceed, or lead to a successful partition of the word,analysis backtracks to try the error rules at succes-sively earlier points in the word.For purposes of simplicity and because oh thewhole is it likely that words will contain no morethan one error (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora,1983), normal 'no error' analysis usually resumes ifan error rule succeeds.
The exception occurs with avowel shift error (?3.2.1).
If this error rule succeeds,an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up,but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequentpartitions.
For this reason rules are marked as towhether they can occur more than once.2.2.2 Suggest ing  a cor rec t ionOnce an error rule is selected, the corrected sur-face is substituted for the error surface, and nor-mai analysis continues - at the same position.
Thesubstituted surface may be in the form of a vari-able, which is then ground by the normal analysissequence of lexical matching over the lexicon tree.In this way only lexical words a~e considered, asthe variable letter can only he instantiated to lettersbranching out from the current position on the lexi-con tree.
Normal prolog backtracking to explore al-ternative rules/lexical branches applies throughout.3 E r ror  Check ing  in  Arab icWe demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbalstems shown in (4) (McCarthy, 1981).
Verbs areclassified according to their measure (M): thereare 15 trilateral measures and 4 quadrilateral ones.Moving horizontally across the table, one notices achange in vowel melody (active {a}, passive {ui});everything else remains invariant.
Moving vertically,a change in canonical pattern occurs; everything elseremains invariant.Subsection 3.1 presents a simple two-level gram-mar  which describes the above data.
Subsection 3.2presents error checking.

Exam-pies of pattern morphemes are: (ClVlC2VlC3} (M 1),{ClC2VlnC3v2c4} (M Q3).
The root morphemes are{ktb} and {db_rj}, and the vocalism morphemes are{a} (active) and {ui} (passive).The following two-level g rammar  handles theabove data.
Each lexical expression is a triple; lex-ical expressions with one symbol assume e on theremaining positions.
(5)GENERAL RULES* X - * ::~R0:  , _ X - ** - (Pc ,  C ,~)  - * =~RI: .
_ C - ** - (P~,~,V)  * =~R2:  , _ V *where Pc E {Cl, c2, c3, c4},P~ E {vl, v2},26(5) gives three general rules: R0 allows any char-acter on the first lexical tape to surface, e.g.
in-fixes, prefixes and suffixes.
R1 states that any P E{Cl, c2, c3, c4} on the first (pattern) tape and Con the second (root) tape with no transition on thethird (vocalism) tape corresponds to C on the sur-face tape; this rule sanctions consonants.
Similarly,tL2 states that any P E {Vl, v2} on the pattern tapeand V on vocalism tape with no transition on theroot tape corresponds toV on the surface tape; thisrule sanctions vowels.
(6)BOUNDARY RULESR3: (B,e,~) - + - * =~?
- 6 - *R4: (B,*,*) (+,+,+) - * ==~where B ~ +(6) gives two boundary rules: R3 is used for non-stem morphemes, e.g.
prefixes and suffixes.
R4 ap-plies to stem morphemes reading three boundarysymbols simultaneously; this marks the end of astem.
Notice that LLC ensures that the right bound-ary rule is invoked at the right time.Before embarking on the rest of the rules, an il-lustrated example seems in order.
The derivationof /dhunr i ja / (M Q5, passive), from the three mor-phemes {ClC2V lnCsv2c4} , {dhrj} and {ui}, and thesuffix {a} '3rd person' is illustrated in (7).

For example the rules sanction both /katab/(M 1, active) and /kutib/ (M 1, passive) as inter-pretations of (ktb) as showin in (10).3.2  Er ror  Ru lesBelow are outlined error rules resulting from pecu-liarly Semitic problems.
Error rules can also be con-structed in a similar vein to deal with typographicalDamerau error (which also take care of the issue of27wrong vocalisms).

Short vowels can legiti-mately be omitted from an orthographic representa-tion - it is this fact which contributes to the problemof vowel shifts.
A vowel is considered shifted if thesame vowel has been omitted earlier in the word.The rule deletes the vowel from the surface.
Hencein the next pass of (normal) analysis, the partitionis analysed as a legitimate omission of the expectedvowel.
This prepares for the next shifted vowel tobe treated in exactly the same way as the first.
Theexpectation of this reapplieation is allowed for inreap = y.

It isdeleted from the surface.
The partition contextualtuples consist of \[RULE NAME, SURF, LEX\].
TheLEX element is a tuple itself of \[PATTERN, ROOT,VOCALISM\].
In E0 the shifted vowel was analysedearlier as an omitted stem vowel (ore_stray), whereasin E1 it was analysed earlier as an omitted spreadvowel (om_sprv).
The surface/lexical restrictions inthe contexts could be written out in more detail, butboth rules make use of the fact that those contextsare analysed by other partitions, which check thatthey meet the conditions for an omitted stem vowelor omitted spread vowel.For example, *(dhruji) will be interpreted as(duhrij).
The 'E0's on the rule number line indicatewhere the vowel shift rule was applied to replace anerror surface vowel with 6.

The data described below was obtained fromDaniel Ponsford (personal communication), basedon (Wehr, 1971).Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root mor-pheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged accord-ing to a canonical pattern morpheme.
As each rootdoes not occur in all vocalisms and patterns, eachlexical entry is associated with a feature structurewhich indicates inter alia the possible patterns andvocalisms for a particular root.
Consider the nomi-nal data in (17).
(17)BROKEN PLURALSSingular Plural Formskadi~ kud~, *kidaa~kaafil kuffal, *kufalaa~, *kuffaalkaffil kufalaaPsahm *Pashaam, suhuum, PashumPatterns marked with * are morphologically plausi-ble, but do not occur lexically with the cited nouns.A common mistake is to choose the wrong pattern.In such a case, the two-level model succeeds infinding two-level analyses of the word in question,but fails when parsing the word morphosyntacti-cally: at this stage, the parser is passed a root, vo-calism and pattern whose feature structures do notunify.Usually this feature-clash situation creates theproblem of which constituent to give preference to(Langer, 1990).
Here the vocalism indicates the in-flection (e.g.
broken plural) and the preferance ofvocalism pattern for that type of inflection belongsto the root.
For example *(kidaa~)would be anal-ysed as root {kd~} with a broken plural vocalism.The pattern type of the vocalism clashes with thebroken plural pattern that the root expects.
To cor-rect, the morphological nalyser is executed in gen-eration mode to generate the broken plural form of{kd~} in the normal way.The same procedure can be applied on diminutiveand deverbal nouns.5 Conc lus ionThe model presented corrects errors resulting fromcombining nonconcatenative strings as well as morestandard morphological or spelling errors.
It cov-ers Semitic errors relating to vocalisation, diacrit-ics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic id-iosyncrasies.
Morphosyntactic issues of broken plu-rals, diminutives and deverbal nouns can be handledby a complementary correction strategy which alsodepends on morphological nalysis.Other than the economic factor, an important ad-vantage of combining morphological nalysis and er-ror detection/correction is the way the lexical treeassociated with the analysis can be used to deter-mine correction possibilities.
The morphologicalanalysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesiselexical strings for a given surface string.
The rulesare accepted/rejected by checking that the lexicalstring(s) can extend along the lexical tree(s) fromthe current position(s).
Variables introduced by er-ror rules into the surface string are then instantiatedby associating surface with lexical, and matchinglexical strings to the lexicon tree(s).
The system isunable to consider correction characters that wouldbe lexical impossibilities.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank their supervisorDr Stephen Pulman.
