GermannThe University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom)www.matecat.comAbstractWe present a new web-based CAT tool providing translators with a professional work environ-ment, integrating translation memories, terminology bases, concordancers, and machine transla-tion.
The tool is completely developed as open source software and has been already successfullydeployed for business, research and education.
The MateCat Tool represents today probably thebest available open source platform for investigating, integrating, and evaluating under realisticconditions the impact of new machine translation technology on human post-editing.1 IntroductionThe objective of MateCat1is to improve the integration of machine translation (MT) and human transla-tion within the so-called computer aided translation (CAT) framework.
CAT tools represent nowadays thedominant technology in the translation industry.
They provide translators with text editors that can man-age several document formats and suitably arrange their content into text segments ready to be translated.Most importantly, CAT tools provide access to translation memories (TMs), terminology databases, con-cordance tools and, more recently, to machine translation (MT) engines.
A TM is basically a repositoryof translated segments.
During translation, the CAT tool queries the TM to search for exact or fuzzymatches of the current source segment.
These matches are proposed to the user as translation sugges-tions.
Once a segment is translated, its source and target texts are added to the TM for future queries.
Theintegration of suggestions from an MT engine as a complement to TM matches is motivated by recentstudies (Federico et al., 2012; Green et al., 2013; L?aubli et al., 2013), which have shown that post-editingMT suggestions can substantially improve the productivity of professional translators.
MateCat lever-ages the growing interest and expectations in statistical MT by advancing the state-of-the-art along threedirections:?
Self-tuning MT, i.e.
methods to train statistical MT for specific domains or translation projects;?
User adaptive MT, i.e.
methods to quickly adapt statistical MT from user corrections and feedback;?
Informative MT, i.e.
supply more information to enhance users?
productivity and work experience.Research along these three directions has converged into a new generation CAT software, which isboth an enterprise level translation workbench (currently used by several hundreds of professional trans-lators) as well as an advanced research platform for integrating new MT functions, running post-editingThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The MateCat Tool, which is distributed under the LGPLopen source license, combines features of the most advanced systems (either commercial, like the pop-ular SDL Trados Workbench,2or free like OmegaT3) with new functionalities.
These include: i) anadvanced API for the Moses Toolkit,4customizable to languages and domains, ii) ease of use through aclean and intuitive web interface that enables the collaboration of multiple users on the same project, iii)concordancers, terminology databases and support for customizable quality estimation components andiv) advanced logging functionalities.2 The MateCat Tool in a NutshellOverview.
The MateCat Tool runs as a web-server accessible through Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
TheCAT web-server connects with other services via open APIs: the TM server MyMemory5, the commer-cial Google Translate (GT) MT server, and a list of Moses-based servers specified in a configuration file.While MyMemory?s and GT?s servers are always running and available, customized Moses servers haveto be first installed and set-up.
Communication with the Moses servers extends the GT API in order tosupport self-tuning, user-adaptive and informative MT functions.
The natively supported document for-mat of MateCat Tool is XLIFF,6although its configuration file makes it possible to specify external fileconverters.
The tool supports Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, including non latin alphabets and right-to-leftlanguages, and handles texts embedding mark-up tags.How it works.
The tool is intended both for individual translators or managers of translation projectsinvolving one or more translators.
A translation project starts by uploading one or more documents andspecifying the desired translation direction.
Then the user can optionally select a MT engine from anavailable list and/or a new or existing private TM in MyMemory, by specifying its private key.
Noticethat the public MyMemory TM and the GT MT services are assumed by default.
The following step isthe volume analysis of the document, which reports statistics about the words to be actually translatedbased on the coverage provided by the TM.
At this stage, long documents can be also split into smallerportions to be for instance assigned to different translators or translated at different times.
The followingstep starts the actual translation process by opening the editing window.
All source segments of the2http://www.translationzone.com/3http://www.omegat.org/4http://www.statmt.org/moses/5http://mymemory.translated.net6http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html130document and their corresponding target segments are arranged side-by-side on the screen.
By selectingone segment, an editing pane opens (Figure 1) including an editable field that is initialized with the bestavailable suggestion or with the last post-edit.
Translation hints are shown right below together withtheir origin (MT or TM).
Their ranking is based on the TM match score or the MT confidence score.
MThints with no confidence score are assigned a default score.
Tag consistency is automatically checkedduring translation and warnings are possibly shown in the editing window.
An interesting feature of theMateCat Tool is that each translation project is uniquely identified by its URL page which also includesthe currently edited segment.
This permits for instance more users to simultaneously access and work onthe same project.
Moreover, to support simultaneous team work on the same project, translators can markthe status (draft, translated, approved, rejected) of each segment with a corresponding color (see Figure1, right blue bar).
The user interface is enriched with search and replace functions, a progress report atthe bottom of the page, and several shortcut commands for the skilled users.
Finally, the tool embeds aconcordance tool to search for terms in the TM, and a glossary where each user can upload, query andupdate her terminology base.
Users with a Google account can access a project management page whichpermits then to manage all their projects, including storage, deletion, and access to the editing page.MT support.
The tool supports Moses-based servers able to provide an enhanced CAT-MT commu-nication.
In particular, the GT API is augmented with feedback information provided to the MT engineevery time a segment is post-edited as well as enriched MT output, including confidence scores, wordlattices, etc.
The developed MT server supports multi-threading to serve multiple translators, properlyhandles text segments including tags, and instantly adapts from the post-edits performed by each user(Bertoldi et al., 2013).Edit Log.
During post-editing the tool collects timing information for each segment, which is updatedevery time the segment is opened and closed.
Moreover, for each segment, information is collected aboutthe generated suggestions and the one that has actually been post-edited.
This information is accessible atany time through a link in the Editing Page, named Editing Log.
The Editing Log page (Figure 2) showsa summary of the overall editing performed so far on the project, such as the average translation speedand post-editing effort and the percentage of top suggestions coming from MT or the TM.
Moreover,for each segment, sorted from the slowest to the fastest in terms of translation speed, detailed statisticsabout the performed edit operations are reported.
This information, with even more details, can be alsodownloaded as a CSV file to perform a more detailed post-editing analysis.
While the information shownin the Edit Log page is very useful to monitor progress of a translation project in real time, the CSV fileis a fundamental source of information for detailed productivity analyses once the project is ended.3 Applications.The MateCat Tool has been exploited by the MateCat project to investigate new MT functions (Bertoldiet al., 2013; Cettolo et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2014) and to evaluate them in a realprofessional setting, in which translators have at disposal all the sources of information they are usedto work with.
Moreover, taking advantage of its flexibility and ease of use, the tool has been recentlyexploited for data collection and education purposes (a course on CAT technology for students in trans-lation studies).
An initial version of the tool has also been leveraged by the Casmacat project7to createa workbench (Alabau et al., 2013), particularly suitable for investigating advanced interaction modalitiessuch as interactive MT, eye tracking, and handwritten input.
Currently the tool is employed by Trans-lated for their internal translation projects and is being tested by several international companies, bothlanguage service providers and IT companies.
This has made possible to collect continuous feedbackfrom hundreds of translators, which besides helping us to improve the robustness of the tool is alsoinfluencing the way new MT functions will be integrated to supply the best help to the final user.7http://www.casmacat.eu131Figure 2: The MateCat Tool edit log page.ReferencesVicent Alabau, Ragnar Bonk, Christian Buck, Michael Carl, Francisco Casacuberta, Mercedes Garca-Mart?
