For gener-ating a wider variety of phrasal paraphrasesin Japanese, it is necessary to paraphrasefunctional expressions as well as content ex-pressions.
We propose a method of para-phrasing of Japanese functional expressionsusing a dictionary with two hierarchies: amorphological hierarchy and a semantic hi-erarchy.
Our system generates appropriatealternative expressions for 79% of sourcephrases in Japanese in an open test.
It alsoaccepts style and readability specifications.1 IntroductionAutomatic paraphrasing is a transformation of ex-pressions into semantically equivalent expressionswithin one language.
It is expected for various ap-plications, such as information retrieval, machinetranslation and a reading/writing aid.Automatic paraphrasing of Japanese text has beenstudied by many researchers after the first interna-tional workshop on automatic paraphrasing (Satoand Nakagawa, 2001).
Most of them focus on para-phrasing of content words, such as noun phrases andverb phrases.
In contrast, paraphrasing of functionalexpressions has less attention.
A functional expres-sion is a function word or a multi-word expressionthat works as a function word.
For generating awider variety of phrasal paraphrases in Japanese, asshown in Fig.
1, it is necessary to paraphrase func-tional expressions as well as content expressions, be-cause almost all phrases in Japanese include one ormore functional expressions.
In this paper, we focuson paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions.In several applications, such as a reading aid,in paraphrasing of Japanese functional expressions,control of readability of generated text is impor-tant, because functional expressions are critical unitsthat determine sentence structures and meanings.
Incase a reader does not know a functional expres-sion, she fails to understand the sentence meaning.If the functional expression can be paraphrased intoan easier one, she may know it and understand thesentence meaning.
It is desirable to generate expres-sions with readability suitable for a reader becauseeasier functional expressions tend to have more thanone meaning.A remarkable characteristic of Japanese func-tional expressions is that each functional expressionhas many different variants.
Each variant has one offour styles.
In paraphrasing of Japanese functionalexpressions, a paraphrasing system should acceptstyle specification, because consistent use in style isrequired.
For example, the paraphrase (b) in Fig.
1is not appropriate for a document in normal style be-cause the expression has polite style.Paraphrasing a functional expression into a se-mantically equivalent one that satisfies style andreadability specifications can be realized as a com-bination of the following two processes:1.
Transforming a functional expression into an-other one that is semantically equivalent to it,often with changing readability.691A phrase keQtei-se / zaru-wo-e-nai Paraphrasing ofcontent expressionsParaphrasing offunctional expressionskimerusadamerukeQtei-wo-suru:shika-naishika-ari-mase-Nyori-hoka-nai:?

Rewriting a functional expression to a variantof it, often with changing style.We propose a method of paraphrasing of Japanesefunctional expressions using a dictionary with twohierarchies: a morphological hierarchy and a se-mantic hierarchy.
The former hierarchy providesa list of all variants specified with style for eachfunctional expression, which is required for theabove process 2.
The latter hierarchy provides se-mantic equivalence classes of functional expressionsand readability level for each functional expression,which are required for the above process 1.2 Related WorkA few studies on paraphrasing of Japanese func-tional expressions have been conducted.
In orderto implement automatic paraphrasing, some stud-ies (Iida et al, 2001; Tsuchiya et al, 2004) use aset of paraphrasing rules, and others (Tanabe et al,2001; Shudo et al, 2004) use semantic equivalenceclasses.All of these studies do not handle variants in asystematic way.
In case a system paraphrases a func-tional expression f into f ?, it also should generate allvariants of f ?
in potential.
However, any proposedsystem does not guarantee this requirement.
Outputselection of variants should be determined accord-ing to the given style specification.
Any proposedsystem does not have such selection mechanism.Controlling readability of generated text is not acentral issue in previous studies.
An exception isa study by Tsuchiya et al (Tsuchiya et al, 2004).Level NumL1 Headword 341L2 Headwords with unique meaning 435L3 Derivations 555L4 Alternations of function words 774L5 Phonetic variations 1,187L6 Insertion of particles 1,810L7 Conjugation forms 6,870L8 Normal or desu/masu forms 9,722L9 Spelling variations 16,801Table 1: Nine levels of the morphological hierarchy.Their system paraphrases a functional expressioninto an easier one.
However, it does not accept thereadability specification, e.g.
for learners of begin-ner course or intermediate course of Japanese.3 A Hierarchically Organized Dictionaryof Japanese Functional Expressions3.1 Morphological hierarchyIn order to organize many different variants of func-tional expressions, we have designed a morpho-logical hierarchy with nine abstraction levels (Mat-suyoshi et al, 2006).
Table 1 summarizes these ninelevels.
The number of entries in L1 (headwords) is341, and the number of leaf nodes in L9 (surfaceforms) is 16,801.
For each surface form in the hier-archy, we specified one of four styles (normal, po-lite, colloquial, and stiff) and connectability (whatword can be to the left and right of the expression).3.2 Semantic hierarchyThere is no available set of semantic equivalenceclasses of Japanese functional expressions for para-phrasing.
Some sets are described in books in lin-guistics (Morita and Matsuki, 1989; Tomomatsu etal., 1996; Endoh et al, 2003), but these are not forparaphrasing.
Others are proposed for paraphrasingin natural language processing (Tanabe et al, 2001;Shudo et al, 2004), but these are not available inpublic.For 435 entries in L2 (headwords with uniquemeaning) of the morphological hierarchy, from theviewpoint of paraphrasability, we have designed asemantic hierarchy with three levels according to thesemantic hierarchy proposed by a book (Morita andMatsuki, 1989).
The numbers of classes in the top,middle and bottom levels are 45, 128 and 199, re-692spectively.
For each entry in L2, we specified one ofreadability levels of A1, A2, B, C, and F accordingto proficiency level in a book (Foundation and of In-ternational Education, Japan, 2002), where A1 is themost basic level and F is the most advanced level.3.3 Producing all surface forms that satisfystyle and readability specificationsFor a given surface form of a functional expression,our dictionary can produce all variants of semanti-cally equivalent functional expressions that satisfystyle and readability specifications.
The procedureis as follows:1.
Find the functional expression in L2 for a givensurface form according to the morphologicalhierarchy.2.
Obtain functional expressions that are seman-tically equivalent to the functional expressionaccording to the semantic hierarchy.3.
Exclude the functional expressions that do notsatisfy readability specification.4.
Enumerate all variants (surface forms) of theremaining functional expressions according tothe morphological hierarchy.5.
Exclude the surface forms that do not satisfystyle specification.4 Formulation of Paraphrasing ofJapanese Functional ExpressionsAs a source expression of paraphrasing, we select aphrase (or Bunsetsu) in Japanese because it is a baseunit that includes functional expressions.
In this pa-per, we define a phrase as follows.
Let cibe a con-tent word, and fja functional expression.
Then, aphrase is formulated as the following:Phrase = c1c2?
?
?
cmf1f2?
?
?
fn, (1)where c1c2?
?
?
cmis the content part of the phraseand f1f2?
?
?
fnis the functional part of it.Paraphrasing of a functional part of a phrase isperformed as a combination of the following fivetypes of paraphrasing:1?1 Substituting a functional expression with an-other functional expression (f ?
f ?
).Paraphrasing type Num1?1 only 214 (61%)1?N (and 1?1) 69 (20%)N?1 (and 1?1) 18 ( 5%)M?N (and 1?1) 8 ( 2%)Otherwise 44 (12%)Sum 353 (100%)Table 2: Number of paraphrases produced by a na-tive speaker of Japanese.1?N Substituting a functional expression with asequence of functional expressions (f ?f?1f?2?

Ta-ble 2 shows the classification result of 353 para-phrases produced by the subject for 238 sourcephrases.1 From this table, it was found out that para-phrasing of ?1?1?
type was major in that it wasused for producing 61% of paraphrases.Because of dominance of paraphrasing of ?1?1?type, we construct a system that paraphrasesJapanese functional expressions in a phrase by sub-stituting a functional expression with a semanticallyequivalent expression.
This system paraphrases aphrase defined as the form in Eq.
(1) into the fol-lowing form:Alternative = c1c2?

type in Table 2.
There-fore, our system theoretically covers 65% (229/353)of the paraphrases in Table 2.5 SystemWe have implemented a system that paraphrasesJapanese functional expressions using a hierarchi-cally organized dictionary, by substituting a func-tional expression with another functional expressionthat is semantically equivalent to it.
The system ac-cepts a phrase in Japanese and generates a list ofranked alternative expressions for it.
The systemalso accepts style and readability specifications.Fig.
2 shows an overview of our system.
This sys-tem consists of three modules: analysis, paraphrasegeneration, and ranking.5.1 AnalysisSome methods have been proposed for detectingJapanese functional expressions based on a set ofdetection rules (Tsuchiya and Sato, 2003) and ma-chine learning (Uchimoto et al, 2003; Tsuchiya etal., 2006).
However, because these methods detectonly a limited number of functional expressions (andtheir variants), we cannot apply them to the analysisof a phrase.
Another method is to add a list of about17,000 surface forms of functional expressions to adictionary of an existing morphological analyzer anddetermine connecting costs based on machine learn-ing.
However, it is infeasible because there is nolarge corpus in which all of these surface forms havebeen tagged.Instead of these methods, we use a differentmethod of decomposing a given phrase into a se-quence of content words and functional expressions.Our method uses two analyzers.We constructed a functional-part analyzer (FPA).This is implemented using a morphological analyzerMeCab2 with a special dictionary containing onlyfunctional expressions.
FPA can decompose a func-tional part (string) into a sequence of functional ex-pressions, but fails to decompose a string when thestring includes one or more content words.
In orderto extract a functional part from a given string, weuse original MeCab.First, original MeCab decomposes a given stringinto a sequence of morphemes m1m2?
?
?mk.Next, we suppose that m1is a content partand m2m3?
?
?mkis a functional part.
If FPAcan decompose m2m3?
?
?mkinto a sequence offunctional expressions f1f2?
?
?
fn, then we obtainc1f1f2?
?
?
fnas shown in Eq.
(1) as an analyzedresult, where c1= m1.
Otherwise, we sup-pose that m1m2is a content part and m3m4?
?
?mkis a functional part.
If FPA can decomposem3m4?
?
?mkinto a sequence of functional expres-sions f1f2?
?
?
fn, then we obtain c1c2f1f2?
?
?
fnasan analyzed result, where c1= m1and c2= m2.This procedure is continued until FPA succeeds indecomposition.5.2 Paraphrase generationThis module accepts an analyzed resultc1c2?

Then, it obtains a surfaceform f ?2that is semantically equivalent to f2andconstructs c1c2?

We define ascoring function as the product of frequencies offunctional expressions in a phrase.6 EvaluationWe evaluate paraphrases generated by our para-phrasing system for validating our semantic equiva-lence classes, because the dictionary that the systemuses guarantees by the method described in subsec-tion 3.3 that the system can generate all variants of afunctional expression and accept style and readabil-ity specifications.6.1 MethodologyWe evaluated paraphrases generated by our para-phrasing system from the viewpoint of an applica-tion to a writing aid, where a paraphrasing systemis expected to output a few good alternative expres-sions for a source phrase.We evaluated the top 5 alternative expressionsgenerated by the system for a source phrase by clas-sifying them into the following three classes:Good Good alternative expression for the sourcephrase.Intermediate Expression that keeps the meaningroughly that the source phrase has.Bad Inappropriate expression.Then, we counted source phrases for which at leastone of the alternative expressions of the top 1 ton was judged as ?Good?.
One of the authors per-formed the judgment according to books (Moritaand Matsuki, 1989; Endoh et al, 2003).As a closed test set, we used 238 example phrasesfor 140 functional expressions extracted from a book(Foundation and of International Education, Japan,2002), which we had used for development of oursemantic equivalence classes.
As an open test set,we used 628 example phrases for 184 functional ex-pressions extracted from a book (Tomomatsu et al,1996).
We used the Mainichi newspaper text corpus(1991-2005, about 21 million sentences, about 1.5gigabytes) for ranking alternative expressions.6.2 ResultsTable 3 shows the results.
The rows with ?Perfectanalysis?
in the table show the results in analyzingsource phrases by hand.
Because the values in everyrow of the table are nearly saturated in ?Top 1 to 3?,we discuss the results of the top 1 to 3 hereafter.Our system generated appropriate alternative ex-pressions for 88% (210/238) and 79% (496/628) ofsource phrases in the closed and the open test sets,respectively.
We think that this performance is highenough.We analyzed the errors made by the system.
In theclosed and the open tests, it was found out that para-phrasing of ?1?1?
type could not generate alterna-tive expressions for 7% (16/238) and 7% (41/628)of source phrases, respectively.
These values definethe upper limit of our system.In the closed and the open tests, it was found outthat the system failed to analyze 3% (8/238) and 3%(21/628) of source phrases, respectively, and that695ambiguity in meaning caused inappropriate candi-dates to be ranked higher for 1% (2/238) and 4%(23/628) of source phrases, respectively.
The rowswith ?Perfect analysis?
in Table 3 show that almostall of these problems are solved in analyzing sourcephrases by hand.
Improvement of the analysis mod-ule can solve these problems.In the open test, insufficiency of semantic equiv-alence classes and too rigid connectability causedonly 3% (19/628) and 3% (16/628) of source phrasesto have no good candidates, respectively.
The small-ness of the former value validates our semanticequivalence classes.The remaining errors were due to low frequenciesof good alternatives in newspaper corpus.7 Conclusion and Future WorkWe proposed a method of paraphrasing Japanesefunctional expressions using a dictionary with twohierarchies.
Our system can generate all variants of afunctional expression and accept style and readabil-ity specifications.
The system generated appropriatealternative expressions for 79% of source phrases inan open test.Tanabe et al have proposed paraphrasing rulesof ?1?N?, ?N?1?, and ?M?N?
types (Tanabeet al, 2001).
For generating a wider variety ofphrasal paraphrases, future work is to incorporatethese rules into our system and to combine severalmethods of paraphrasing of content expressions withour method.ReferencesOrie Endoh, Kenji Kobayashi, Akiko Mitsui, ShinjiroMuraki, and Yasushi Yoshizawa, editors.
