Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (WSSANLP), pages 35?42,the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), Beijing, August 2010Web Based Manipuri Corpus for Multiword NER andReduplicated MWEs Identification using SVMThoudam Doren SinghDepartment of Computer Science andEngineeringJadavpur Universitythoudam.doren@gmail.comSivaji BandyopadhyayDepartment of Computer Science andEngineeringJadavpur Universitysivaji_cse_ju@yahoo.comAbstractA web based Manipuri corpus is devel-oped for identification of reduplicatedmultiword expression (MWE) and mul-tiword named entity recognition (NER).Manipuri is one of the rarely investi-gated language and its resources fornatural language processing are notavailable in the required measure.
Theweb content of Manipuri is also verypoor.
News corpus from a popular Ma-nipuri news website is collected.
Ap-proximately four and a half million Ma-nipuri wordforms have been collectedfrom the web.
The mode of corpus col-lection and the identification of redupli-cated MWEs and multiword NE basedon support vector machine (SVM)learning technique are reported.
TheSVM based reduplicated MWE systemis evaluated with recall, precision and F-Score values of 94.62%, 93.53% and94.07% respectively outperforming therule based approach.
The recall, preci-sion and F-Score for multiword NE areevaluated as 94.82%, 93.12% and93.96% respectively.1 IntroductionThe NER and MWE identification are importanttasks for natural language applications that in-clude machine translation and information re-trieval.
The present work reports the NER andreduplicated MWE identification of Manipurion web based news corpus.
The use of web as acorpus for teaching and research on languageshas been proposed several times (Rundell, 2000;Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher 2004).
Aspecial issue of the Computational Linguisticsjournal on web as corpus (Kilgarriff and Gre-fenstette, 2003) was published.
Several studieshave used different methods to mine web data.The web walked into the ACL meetings startingin 1999.
The special interest group of ACL onweb as corpus is promoting interest in the use ofthe web as a source of linguistic data, and as anobject of study in its own right.
India is a multi-lingual country with a lot of cultural diversity.Bharati et al (2001) reports an effort to createlexical resources such as transfer lexicon andgrammar from English to several Indian lan-guages and dependency Treebank of annotatedcorpora for several Indian languages.
In Indiancontext, a web based Bengali corpus develop-ment work from web is reported in Ekbal andBandyopadhyay (2008) and Manipuri-Englishsemi automatic parallel corpora extraction bySingh et.
al., (2010).
Newspaper is a hugesource of readily available documents.
In thepresent work, the Manipuri monolingual corpushas been developed from web for NLP and re-lated tasks.Manipuri is a scheduled Indian languagespoken approximately by three million peoplemainly in the state of Manipur in India and inthe neighboring countries namely Bangladeshand Myanmar.
It is a Tibeto-Burman languageand highly agglutinative in nature, influencedand enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages ofSanskrit origin and English.
The affixes play themost important role in the structure of the lan-guage.
In Manipuri, words are formed in threeprocesses called affixation, derivation and com-pounding.
The majority of the roots found in the35language are bound and the affixes are the de-termining factor of the class of the words in thelanguage.
Annotated corpus, bilingual dictiona-ries, name dictionaries, WordNet, morphologi-cal analyzers etc.
are not yet available in Mani-puri in the required measure.In the present work, the tasks of identifica-tion of Manipuri multiword named entity (MNE)and reduplicated multiword expression (RMWE)identification using support vector machine(SVM) learning technique on the corpus col-lected from web is reported.Works on multiword expressions (MWEs)have started with a momentum in different lan-guages.
In the Indian context, some of theworks can be seen in (Dandapat et.
al., 2006;Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008; Kishorjit et.al., 2010).
The identification of MWEs in sev-eral languages concentrate on compound nouns,noun-verb combination, some on idioms andphrases and so on but not much on RMWEs.The reason may be that the reduplicated wordsare either rare or easy to identify for these lan-guages since only complete duplication andsome amount of partial reduplication may bepresent in these languages.
On the other hand,reduplicated MWEs are quite large in number inManipuri and there are wide varieties of redup-licated MWEs in Manipuri.2 Manipuri News Corpus and Statis-ticsThe content of Manipuri language on the web isvery poor.
One of the sources is the daily newspublications.
Again, there is no repository.
Thus,the possibility of deploying web crawler andmining the web corpus is not possible.
The Ma-nipuri news corpus is collected fromhttp://www.thesangaiexpress.com/ covering theperiod from May 2008 to May 2010 on dailybasis.
The Manipuri news is available in PDFformat.
A tool has been developed to convertcontents from PDF documents to Unicode for-mat.
There are 15-20 articles in each day.
Con-sidering the Manipuri corpus covering the pe-riod from May 2008 to May 2010, there are4649016 wordforms collected1.1There are no publications on some occasions.2.1 Conversion from PDF to UTF-8The general Manipuri news collected is in PDFformat.
A tool has been developed to convertManipuri news PDF articles to Bengali Unicode.The Bengali Unicode characters are used torepresent Manipuri as well.
The conversion ofPDF format into Unicode involves the conver-sion to ASCII and then into Unicode usingmapping tables between the ASCII charactersand corresponding Bengali Unicode.
The map-ping tables have been prepared at different le-vels with separate tables for single charactersand conjuncts with two or more than two cha-racters.
The single character mapping table con-tains 72 entries and the conjunct charactersmapping table consists of 738 entries.
There areconjuncts of 2, 3 and 4 characters.
Sub-tablesfor each of the conjuncts are prepared.
Englishwords are present on the Manipuri side of thenews and they are filtered to avoid unknowncharacter features.2.2 Use of language resourcesThe Manipuri web corpus collected from theweb is cleaned by removing the unknown cha-racters.
After the cleaning process, the runningtexts are picked up followed by spelling correc-tion.
The web based news corpus is POS taggedusing the 26 tagset2 defined for the Indian lan-guages based on the work of (Singh et.
al.
,2008).
The Manipuri news corpus developed inthis work has been used to identify MNE andRMWEs identification.3 Support Vector MachineThe SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is based on discr i-minative approach and makes use of both pos i-tive and negative examples to learn the distinc-tion between the two classes.
The SVMs areknown to robustly handle large feature sets andto develop models that maximize their generali-zability.
Suppose we have a set of training datafor a two-class problem: 1 1{( , ),.....( , )}N Nx y x y,where xi ?
RD is a feature vector of the ith sam-ple in the training data and yi ?
{+1, -1} is theclass to which xi belongs.
The goal is to find adecision function that accurately predicts class y2http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf36for an input vector x.
A non-linear SVM clas-sifier gives a decision function f (x)= sign (g (x))for an input vector where,1( ) ( , )im iig x wK x z b??
??
Here, f(x)=+1 meansx is a member of a certain class and f(x)=-1means x is not a member.
The support vector isrepresented by zi and stands for the training ex-amples; m is the number of support vectorsTherefore, the computational complexity of g(x)is proportional to m. Support vectors and otherconstants are determined by solving a certainquadratic programming problem.
( , )iK x z is akernel that implicitly maps vectors into a higherdimensional space.
Typical kernels use dotproducts: ( , ) ( .
)iK x z k x z?
.A polynomial ker-nel of degree d is given by ( , )iK x z = (1+x)d.We can use various kernels, and the design ofan appropriate kernel for a particular applicationis an important research issue.The MNE/RMWE tagging system includestwo main phases: training and classification.The training process has been carried out byYamCha3 toolkit, an SVM based tool for detect-ing classes in documents and formulating theMNE/RMWE tagging task as a sequence labe-ling problem.
Here, both one vs rest and pair-wise multi-class decision methods have beenused.
Different experiments with the variousdegrees of the polynomial kernel function havebeen carried out.
In one vs rest strategy, K bi-nary SVM classifiers may be created whereeach classifier is trained to distinguish one classfrom the remaining K-1 classes.
In pairwiseclassification, we constructed K (K-1)/2 clas-sifiers considering all pairs of classes, and thefinal decision is given by their weighted voting.For classification, the TinySVM-0.074 classifierhas been used that seems to be the best opti-mized among publicly available SVM toolkits.4 Multiword Named Entity Recogni-tionNamed Entity Recognition for Manipuri is re-ported in (Singh et.
al., 2009).
The present workfocuses and reports on the recognition of mul-tiword NEs.
In order to identify the MNEs,3http://chasen-org/~taku/software/yamcha/4http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/~taku-ku/software/TinySVM28,629 wordforms from Manipuri news corpushas been manually annotated and used as train-ing data with the major named entity (NE) tags,namely person name, location name, organiza-tion name and miscellaneous name to applySupport Vector Machine (SVM) based machinelearning technique.
Miscellaneous name in-cludes the festival name, name of objects, nameof building, date, time, measurement expressionand percentage expression etc.
The SVM basedsystem makes use of the different contextualinformation of the words along with the varietyof word-level orthographic features that arehelpful in predicting the MNE classes.MNE identification in Indian languages aswell as in Manipuri is difficult and challengingas:?
Unlike English and most of the European lan-guages, Manipuri lacks capitalization infor-mation, which plays a very important role inidentifying MNEs.?
A lot of MNEs in Manipuri can appear in thedictionary with some other specific meanings.?
Manipuri is a highly inflectional languageproviding one of the richest and most chal-lenging sets of linguistic and statistical fea-tures resulting in long and complex word-forms.?
Manipuri is a relatively free word order lan-guage.
Thus MNEs can appear in subject andobject positions making the NER task moredifficult compared to others.?
Manipuri is a resource-constrained language.Annotated corpus, name dictionaries, sophis-ticated morphological analyzers, POS taggersetc.

Named entity examples37In the present work, the NE tagset usedhave been further subdivided into the detailedcategories in order to denote the boundaries ofMNEs properly.
Table 1 shows examples.5 Reduplicated MWEs IdentificationManipuri is very rich in RMWEs like other Ti-beto-Burman languages.
The work of (Singh,2000) describes the linguistic rules for identify-ing reduplicated words.
A rule based ManipuriRMWE identification is reported in (Kishorjitand Bandyopadhyay, 2010).
The process of re-duplication (Singh, 2000) is defined as: ?redup-lication is that repetition, the result of whichconstitutes a unit word?.
These single unitwords are the MWEs.
The RMWEs in Manipuriare classified as: 1) Complete RMWEs, 2) Par-tial RMWEs, 3) Echo RMWEs and 4) MimicRMWEs.
Apart from these four types ofRMWEs, there are also cases of a) DoubleRMWEs and b) Semantic RMWEs.Complete RMWEs: In the completeRMWEs the single word or clause is repeatedonce forming a single unit regardless of phono-logical or morphological variations.????
????
(?marik marik?)
which means?drop by drop?.????
??????
(?atek atek-pa? )
whichmeans ?fresh????
???
(?kari kari?)
means ?what/which?.Partial RMWEs: In case of partialreduplication the second word carries some partof the first word as an affix to the second word,either as a suffix or a prefix.For example, ?????
?????
(?chat-thok chat-sin?)
means ?to go to and fro?
; ????
?????
(?saa-milaan-mi?)
means ?army?.Mimic RMWEs: In the mimicreduplication the words are completereduplication but the morphemes areonomatopoetic, usually emotional or naturalsounds.
For example, ???
???
(?krak krak?
)means ?cracking sound of earth in drought?.Echo RMWEs: The second word does nothave a dictionary meaning and is basically anecho word of the first word.
For example, ????????
(?thak-si kha-si?)
means ?good manner?.Double RMWEs: Such type of reduplica-tion generally consists of three words where theprefix or suffix of the first two words is redupli-cated but in the third word the prefix or suffix isabsent.
An example of double prefix reduplica-tion is ????
????
?????
(?i-mun i-mun mun-ba?
)which means, ?completely ripe?.Semantic RMWEs: Both the reduplicationwords have the same meaning and so also is theMWE.
Such types of MWEs are very special tothe Manipuri language.
For example,  ?????
??
(?paamba kei?)
means ?tiger?
and each of thecomponent words means ?tiger?.5.1 Role of suffix and prefixApart from the above cases meaningful prefixesor suffixes are used with RMWEs otherwisethey are ungrammatical.Suffixes/ wh- duplicatingwordsPart ofSpeech??

Suffixes/wh- duplicating words listused in Complete Reduplication and  POStaggingPrefix: With such prefixes the semanticshapes are different and sometimes even thesame prefix carries a different meaning.
Bythese prefixation, the root is reduplicated asgiven below:{[?(i)-/??(pang)-/??(khang)-/?(ta)-/???(pum)-/???
(suk)] + Root }?{[?(i)-/??(pang)-/??(khang)-/?(ta)-/???(pum)-/???

????
???
?mahaak-na       i-waang    waang-ngihe/she-nom    ?tall          tall-aspHe/She is the tallestSuffix: There are some suffixes that carrycertain meaning when used with RMWEs.Commonly used suffixes are, ???
(-trik) / ???
(-drik), ????
(-throk), ????
(-drong), ???
(-suk), ??
(-sang), ???
(-dring), ???
(-sit), ???
(-sin), ???
(-38dreng), ????
(-sroke) etc.
Generally these suffix-es indicate a superlative degree or emphaticmeaning.Some examples are as follows,??????
????
?mun-trik   mun-baripe         ripe?very ripe?Role of affix in Partial Reduplication:Character-wise comparisons are done with notless than two characters either from front or rearfor both the words since the second word is nota complete repetition.Also the last few characters of the firstword and the same number of first characters ofthe second word are compared to check the par-tial reduplication.
The prefixes or suffixes areverified with a list of accepted suffixes and pre-fixes (see table 2) to validated the reduplication.Role of affix in Echo Reduplication:Identification of echo reduplication is done bycomparing the equality of suffixes of   consecu-tive two words w1 and w2.6 Best Feature Selection for SVMThe use of prefix/suffix information works wellfor the highly inflected languages like the In-dian languages.
Different combinations fromthe following set for identifying  the best featureset for MNE/RMWE are experimented:F={ , .., 1, , 1, ....,i m i i i i nw w w w w?
?
?
?, |prefix|<=n,|suffix|<=n, MNE/RMWE tag(s) of previousword(s), POS tag(s) of the current and/or thesurrounding word(s), First word, Length of theword, Digit information, Infrequent word},where iw  is the current word; i mw ?
is theprevious mth word and i nw ?
is the next nthword.
Following are the details of the features:1 Context word feature: Preceding and fol-lowing words of a particular word sincethe surrounding words carry effective in-formation for the identification ofMNE/RMWEs.2 Word suffix: Word suffix information ishelpful to identify MNE/RMWEs.
This isbased on the observation that theMNE/RMWEs share some common suf-fixes.
The fixed length (say, n) word suf-fix of the current and/or the surroundingword(s) can be treated as the feature.
Ifthe length of the corresponding word isless than or equal to n ?
1 then the featurevalues are not defined and are denoted by?ND?.
The feature value is also not de-fined (ND) if the token itself is a punctua-tion symbol or contains any special sym-bol or digit.
Word suffixes are the effec-tive features and work well for the highlyinflective Indian languages like Manipuri.3 Word prefix: Word prefixes are also help-ful to identify MNE/RMWEs.
It is basedon the observation that MNE/RMWEsshare some common prefix strings.
Thisfeature has been defined in a similar wayas that of the fixed length suffixes.4 MNE and RMWE Information: TheMNE/RMWE tag(s) of the previousword(s) have been used as the only dy-namic feature in the experiment.
The out-put tag of the previous word is very in-formative in deciding the MNE/RMWEtag of the current word.5 Digit features: Several binary valued digitfeatures have been defined dependingupon the(i).
Presence and/or the exact numberof digits in a token.(a).
CntDgtCma: Token consists ofdigits and comma(b).
CntDgtPrd: Token consists ofdigits and periods(ii).
Combination of digits and sym-bols.
For example,(a).
CntDgtSlsh: Token consists ofdigit and slash(b).
CntDgtHph: Token consists ofdigits and hyphen(c).
CntDgtPrctg: Token consists ofdigits and percentages(iii).
Combination of digit and specialsymbols.
For example,(a).
CntDgtSpl: Token consists ofdigit and special symbol such as $,# etc.39These binary valued digit features arehelpful in recognizing miscellaneousNEs such as measurement expressionand percentage expression.6 Infrequent word: The frequencies of thewords in the training corpus have beencalculated.
A cut off frequency has beenchosen in order to consider the words thatoccur with less than the cut off frequencyin the training corpus.
A binary valuedfeature ?Infrequent?
is defined to checkwhether the current word appears in thisinfrequent word list or not.
This is basedon the observation that the infrequentwords are most probably MNE/RMWEs.7 Length of a word: This binary valued fea-ture is used to check whether the lengthof the current word is less than three ornot.
We have observed that very shortwords are most probably not theMNE/RMWEs.8 Part of Speech (POS) information:We have used an SVM-based POStagger (Singh et.
al., 2008) that wasoriginally developed with 26 POStags, defined for the Indian languages.The POS information of the currentand/or the surrounding words can beeffective for MNE/RMWE identifica-tion.The Table 3 gives the statistics of training,development and test sets.
The various nota-tions used in the experiments are presented inTable 4.
The Table 5 shows the recall (R), pre-cision (P) and F-Score (FS) in percentage in thedevelopment set.Table 3.

This trainingdata of 28,629 is then manually annotated witha coarse-grained tagset of four NE tags and sixRMWEs in order to apply SVM and tested with4,763 wordforms.
The SVM classifier makesuse of the different contextual information ofthe words along with the various orthographicword-level features.
A number of experimentshave been carried out to find out the best set offeatures for MWE in Manipuri.
The SVM basedRMWE system outperforms the rule based ap-proach.
The SVM based RMWE shows recall,precision and F-Score of 94.62%, 93.53% and94.07% respectively.
The rule based RMWE41identification shows a recall, precision and F-Score of 94.24%, 82.27% and 87.68% respec-tively.
The overall performance of the systemshows reasonable output for both MNE andRMWE.ReferencesBharati, A., Sharma, D. M., Chaitanya, V., Kulkarni,A.
