A novel aspect ofour account is that we distinguish between twokinds of temporal intervals in the interpretationof temporal operators - -  discourse reference inter-vals and event intervals.
This distinction makesit possible to develop an analogy between center-ing and temporal centering, which operates on dis-course reference intervals.
Our temporal property-sharing principle is a defeasible inference rule onthe logical form.
Along with lexical and causalreasoning, it plays a role in incrementally resolv-ing underspecified aspects of the event structurerepresentation f an utterance against he currentcontext.The  Prob lemThe past tense has been compared with anaphoricdefinite pronouns (\[20\] \[22\]) and definite nounphrases (\[27\]).
The supporting observation isthat in two consecutive past tense descriptions ofevents, as in (1) below (from \[18\]), the second sen-tence refers to a time (t') whose identity dependson the time (t) of the event described in the firstsentence.(1)a.
The Lone Ranger got on his horse.
(t)b.
He rode off into the sunset.
(t')Tense interpretation also involves common-sense inferences in that the specific relation be-tween the two event times may vary.
In (1), therelation inferred to hold is temporal progression (t-~ t'), but other ordering relations are also possible(see \[6\] \[27\]).
Any temporal relations are in factpossible for two consecutively described events indiscourse.A number of factors affect the interpretationas to whether successive past tenses are anaphor-ically related, and if they are, what the relativeorder of the associated events is.
The determinantfactors have been argued to be discourse struc-ture (\[27\] \[14\]), aspectual type (\[61 \[12\] [17\]), sur-face structure (\[7\] \[14\]), and commonsense knowl-edge (\[19\] [271 \[13\]).
However, no account has ad-equately addressed all four factors.The problem in tense interpretation that weaddress is illustrated with Example (2) (from \[27\]).(2)a.
John went over (el) to Mary's house.b.
On the way, he had (t2) stopped (t3) by theflower shop for some roses.
(t3 -~ t2 (=tl))c. Unfortunately, they failed (t4) to cheer herup.
(t3 -~ t l  -~ t4)c'.
He picked out (t4') 5 red ones, 3 white onesand 1 pale pink.
(t3 -< t4' -< t l)(2c) and (2c') are alternative third sentences.
Al-though both are in the simple past, and both evokeevents of the same aspectual type (transition event\[23\]), they are interpreted ifferently.
We referto the contextually established time that a pasttense is resolved against as the "discourse refer-ence time."
A discourse reference time (tl) is in-troduced in (2a) with the event of John going toMary's house at t l )  The past perfect in (2b) in-troduces two times: John's stopping at the flowershop (t3) precedes the time t2 (t3 -~ t2), and t2 istypically inferred to be equal to the time of goingover to Mary's house (tl); hence t3 ~ tl.
In (2c),the time of failing to cheer Mary (t4) is inferredto occur just after tl, whereas in the parallel ver-sion (2c'), the time of picking out roses (t4') isinferred to occur during or just after t3, thus be-fore tl.
Thus, as noted by Webber \[27\], a pastperfect evokes two temporal referents (e.g., t2 andt3) and either of them can provide a discourse ref-erence time for a subsequent past tense.1Later we will see that although the first tense gen-erates a discourse reference time for the subsequentone, its temporal referent (here tl) is not preciselyequivalent to it.70Another aspect of the problem in tense in-terpretation is illustrated with so-called extendedflashbacks uch as Example (3), similar to the onediscussed in \[14\].
(3) John and Mary went to buy a lawnmower.Somebody had stolen theirs the day before.They had seen the thief go away.
John hadrun after him to no avail.
All the lawnmow-ers were too expensive.
They decided theycouldn't afford a new one.There are two narrative threads in (3), one de-scribing John and Mary's visit to a store, the otherJohn's chase of the thief.
These threads corre-spond to the repeated use of the past and of thepast perfect, respectively.
The return from thepast perfect o the past in also coincides with thereturn to the earlier thread.
Note that (i) notonly the simple past but also the past perfectcan achieve an effect of continuity and that (it)more than one discourse reference time needs tobe maintained in order to account for the returnto an earlier one.The general problem in tense interpretationthat we address is how to keep track of all the po-tential discourse reference times in a context, andhow to select the right one for a given anaphoricpast tense.We argue that the choice of the discourse an-tecedent of a temporal operator is subject to cen-tering effects.
We assume that each temporal op-erator in a sentence introduces a discourse refer-ence time into the discourse context.
We claimthat this set of times constitutes a list of poten-tial discourse reference times for the next sentence,which we'll later refer to as the temporal forward-looking center (TCf), and that the position of atemporal operator in the logical form of the sen-tence affects the choice of the antecedent throughstructural parallelism (as a case of the property-sharing effect in centering \[16\]).We formalize the effect of surface structure onthe choice of temporal antecedent by means of de-feasible axioms.
These axioms must be less specificthan axioms encoding causal reasoning.
We arguethat the choice of discourse reference time is aninstance of a general principle in defeasible rea-soning, namely, the Penguin Principle \[19\] thatchooses the most specific axiom applicable.
Wesupport our claims with data from the Brown cor-pus.In the next section, we review the three ex-isting proposals most related to ours - -  Webber\[27\], Lascarides and Oberlander \[19\], and Hwangand Schubert \[14\].
The next two sections presenta review of centering followed by a discussion ofthe analogous effects of temporal centering.
Toaccount for temporal centering effects, we thenpresent our tense rules and our account of howcommonsense r asoning interacts with the defaultpreferences generated by the surface structure.Re la ted  WorkWebber \[27\] argues that temporal entities aresubject to focusing processes analogous to thoseconstraining the interpretation of definite nounphrases.
She explicitly rejects, however, a moredirect analogy to Sidner's \[26\] potential local foci,and assumes only one temporal referent in thetemporal focus (TF).Lascarides and Oberlander \[19\] present de-feasible reasoning rules for narrative understand-ing that partly address the reasoning and controlneeds of Webber's model.
For example, they arguethat in the case of conflicting inferences regard-ing the temporal order of two times \[e.g., whetherprecedes, follows, or overlaps\], the most specificinterpretation should be preferred.
However, theydo not address cases such as (2), where there aremultiple possible discourse reference times and thechoice of one interpretation over the other needsto be accounted for.Itwang and Schubert \[14\] intend to accountfor the role played by structural factors in thechoice of anaphoric relations among distinct pasttenses.
They propose the contextual structurescalled tense trees built as a narrative gets inter-preted.
Tense trees reflect the structural depen-dencies among the tense and aspect operators inthe interpretation of the sentences.
The eventsevoked by a sentence are "appended" to the treenodes whose positions reflect the structural posi-tions of the corresponding temporal operators inthe sentence.Webber \[27\] and Hwang and Schubert \[14\] dif-fer markedly regarding the relative weight theyassign to commonsense inferences versus surfacestructure, but both have problems with exampleslike (2).
Neither can readily account for the in-terpretation assigned to (2c').
Webber assumesthat the TF of (2b) is initially t l ,  but shifts to t3,thus initiating an embedded segment, after (2c')has been processed sufficiently to recognize thatTF=t3 yields a more sensible interpretation thanTF=t2(=t l ) .
She does not discuss how t3 comesto be considered as a potential TF in this case,much less how to reject t2(=tl) .
Like Webber,Hwang and Schubert assume that (2c') requiresrecognition of an embedded segment, but admit-tedly they have not resolved the conflict betweenthe need for discourse segment recognition, a taskfor commonsense r asoning, and the clear sepa-ration of tense resolution from commonsense r a-soning that they advocate.
They also fail to dis-tinguish betwen the hierarchical structures of sen-7\]tences and discourses in the tense tree.
Tense treethus overcommits in places where the rule shouldbelong to defeasible preferences.Our approach is to formulate the structuralpreferences for tense resolution as defeasible rulesanalogous to centering preferences for pronoun res-olution.
These structural preferences, which areoverlooked in Webber's or Lascarides and Ober-lander's accounts, interact with the commonsenseinferences used in tense interpretation.Center ingCentering \[9\] is a refinement of Sidner's \[26\] localfocusing model.
It consists of a set of principlesand rules for dynamically updating the local at-tentional state \[11\] in discourse processing.We assume the following general picture ofdiscourse processing.
A discourse consists of a se-quence of utterances uttl,..., uttn.
The sentencegrammar translates the content of each utteranceutti into a (set of) surface logical form(s) contain-ing unresolved anaphoric expressions and opera-tors.
We call it here a "surface" formula ?i.
Thislogical form is similar, in spirit, to Hwang andSchubert's \[14\] indexical formula and Alshawi's \[2\]quasi logical form, whose main motivations are torepresent hat part of the sentence meaning in-dependent from the particular discourse context.This "baseline" meaning representation acts as aclean interface to the pragmatic processing neededto resolve context-dependent expressions.
Utter-ance interpretation takes place in a context, andoutputs an updated context.
Part of this dynamiccontext is the attentional state that represents thecurrently salient entities partially ordered by rel-ative salience.We say that each formula ?i defines a transi-tion relation between the input attentional stateASi_I and the output attentional state ASi.
Anattentional state ASi contains the focus of atten-tion Foci whose most salient subpart is the centerof attention.
After resolving anaphoric expressionsin ?i, the center of attention contains a partiallyordered set of forward-looking centers Cfi com-prising the entities realized in ?i.
A member ofCfi might (but need not) be the backward-lookingcenter Cbi, the currently most salient entity.Centering has mainly been used to constrainhow discourse anaphoric pronouns are processed;e.g., the centering rule \[9\] predicts that Cbl willbe realized with a pronoun if Cbi=Cbi_l.
2 Also,when Cbi=Cbi-1 and both are realized by definitepronouns, it is predicted that both will be real-2Here we avoid the complication acknowledged in\[11\] that the two relevant utterances need not literallybe adjacent.a.

A number oftransition relation types have been distinguishedin centering.
In this paper, we will use the fol-lowing four types: Cb-retention, Cb-establishment,Cb-resumption, and NULL-transition.
zIn Cb-retention, the same entity is retainedas the Cb: Cbi-1 = Cbi y?
NULL.
In Cb-establishment, another member of Cf  becomesthe Cb: Cbi-1 ~ Cbl, Cbi E eli-1 (Cbi-1 maybe NULL).
These two are the most relevant tothe present paper.
In Cb-resumption, an old Cbnot in Cf  but in the current Foc is resumed.In NULL-transition, the output state has no Cb(Cbi=NULL).
Centering posits a default prefer-ence for retention over establishment.
We pro-visionally assume that establishment is preferredover resumption or NULL-transition.We illustrate centering with Fig.
1, where cand c' are alternative continuations of b.
After a.,C fl contains two entities, John ~ and storel.
In b.,John ~ is referred to with a subject pronoun, andis established as Cb2.
In c., because John ~ is thecurrent Cb, and because retention is preferred overestablishment, centering predicts that a subjectpronoun will refer to John ~ rather than to Bill(The default is overridden in c' and instead, thesubject pronoun is inferred to refer to BiW becauseit is likely that the perceiver in the first perceptualstate, see ~, remains the perceiver in the subsequentperceptual state, appear ~.
"3Cb-retention and Cb-establishment are due toKameyama \[15\] [16\].
These two roughly correspondto the three \[10\] and four \[5\] transition types pro-posed elsewhere.
Cb-resumption captures Sidner's \[26\]use of a discourse focus stack in the potential focuslist, and can be analogously formalized as a Cb stackwithin the Cf.
NULL-transition has been implicit inKameyama's work but has not been made an explicittransition type.72a.

I.
As illustrated in Figure 2, we wouldlike to say that utterances (2a) and (2b) sharethe same discourse reference time rl that links t2to tl.
The shared discourse reference time rl isthereby established as a backward-looking tempo-ral center (TCb).
(2c) retains the TCb, linking t4to t2(=tl) ,  whereas (2c') establishes a new TCb,linking t4' to t3.In order to establish a direct analogy betweencentering and temporal centering, however, weneed to first clarify the nature of the temporalentities in the attentional state.
Note that if (2c)retains the "same" TCb, this TCb cannot be iden-tified with either t2 of (2b) or t4 of (2c), since t2and t4 are distinct (t l=t2, t l  -< t4).
The TCbremains fixed while the event times within it maymove forward or backward.
The TCb is then quitedifferent from the reference time as used in propos-als inspired by Reichenbach \[25\] such as Dowty's\[6\] and ttinrichs \[12\]).
4 Recall the extended flash-back example (3) above.
There are two simulta-neous narrative threads, in the simple past and inthe past perfect, and the former seems to remainsomehow in the background while the latter is inthe foreground.
These examples eem to indicatethat when processing a text a reader maintainsa list of "potential foci" ordered by their relativesalience, instead only one temporal focus, as inWebber's account.Further evidence in favor of the analogy wasobtained by examining a random sample of dis-4A similar proposal is made by Kamp and Reyle\[17\], where they argue for the separation of the tem-poral perspective point ( TPpt) that is relatively fixedand the re\]erence point (Rpt) that moves with narra-tive progression.course sequences from the Brown corpus \[8\], aheterogeneous corpus that should yield unbiaseddata.
Each multi-sentence sequence containedone of two types of trigger sentences with multi-ple temporal operators - -  the past perfect matrixclause or the past matrix verb taking an embed-ded past or past perfect complement clause (e.g.,John remembered that Mary had asked for roses).We observed that this trigger's output TCb wasalmost always the time associated with the super-ordinate operator.
Following each trigger was atarget sentence with a simple past matrix clause.This creates a sequence analogous to (2b-c) or(2b-c').
We analyzed each sequence to determinewhether the discourse reference time for the pastin the target sentence was introduced by the trig-ger's superordinate operator (as a case of TCb-retention) or by a subordinate operator (as a caseof TCb-establishment).
In the total of 80 exam-pies, we found 52 retentions (65%) and 12 estab-lishments 15%).
Others included 9 cases of "nei-ther" (11%) (some combination of resumption andNULL-transition) and 7 undecidable cases (9%).These data are consistent with our hypothesis thatin a sentence with multiple temporal operators,the relative likelihood that a given temporal op-erator provides the discourse reference time for asubsequent past depends on its syntactic promi-nence.
The question is, how do temporal centeringand commonsense r asoning interact to yield theobserved results?Two leve ls  o f  log ica l  representat ionOur explanation for the interaction between tem-poral centering and commonsense r asoning restson assuming two distinct levels of representationin sentence interpretation.
One is the logical formindependent from the context and obtained by adirect translation of the surface syntactic structureof the utterance.
The other is a fully resolved log-ical expression that results from incrementally re-solving context-dependent xpressions in the log-ical form.
For simplicity, our discussion ignoresanything but temporal operators.Much as in Hwang and Schubert's proposal\[14\], the logical form contains unresolved tempo-ral operators - -  e.g., tense operators, PR~.S(ent)and PAST, and aspectual operators, PERF(ect) andPROG(ressive).
It also represents the structural po-sition of the temporal operators in a sentence.
Thecrucial difference is that we take each tense andaspect operator to also give rise to a discourse ref-erence interval (see below) that is contextually re-solved.
Our logical forms for (2a) and (2b) areshown in (4).(4)a.

(PASTr2 (PERFr3 'John stops by theflorist for some roses'))The temporal operators in our logical formsare translated into the language of what we call theevent structure representation (ESR).
In essence,ESR represents the temporal and causal relationsamong the eventualities described in discourse.We will use Allen's \[1\] interval representationscheme for this representation level.
Describedeventualities correspond to event intervals andwhat we have been calling the "discourse referencetimes" correspond to discourse reference intervals.To represent relations among these temporal inter-vals, we use disjunctive subsets of Allen's thirteenrelations.
With Allen's representation, we can di-rectly represent vague or ambiguous temporal rela-tions expressed in natural anguage and incremen-tally resolve them to more specific relations usingconstraint propagation.
Our discourse referenceintervals coincide exactly with the computationalrole of Allen's reference intervals.Tense  mapp ing  ru lesNow we define the recursive mapping r be-tween the logical form and the event structurerepresentation.
5 These tense mapping rules "un-pack" the relations among relevant event inter-vals and discourse reference intervals encoded bytemporal operators in the logical form, and gen-erate the initial event structure representation.Although these rules look similar to IIwang andSchubert's tense deindexing rules, they play a verydifferent role.
Rather than performing sentenceinterpretation, as their deindexing rules do, ourmapping rules specify the semantics of the logicalform in terms of the event structure representa-tion.
The v rules for PAST and PERF are shown inFig.

We express this relation ase ~ ?
(e supports ?).
A statement of this formevaluates to true if the denotation of e is an ele-ment of the denotation of ?.Each event interval e is temporally includedin a discourse reference interval r, semanticallytreated as an open variable - -  the value of r isconstrained by contextual factors such as tempo-ral centering and commonsense r asoning, as de-scribed in a later section.Superllo~ and SuperRef have values deter-mined by the position of the subformula 0PC in thelogical form.
SuperNow evaluates to the currentutterance interval- the time interval in whichthe current utterance takes place.
We assume thatthere is an updating mechanism for SuperNow de-fined for each utterance initiation including theonset of a quoted speech.

We can state certain default speci-fications of orients.
For example, involving twotransition event intervals, orients defaults to pre-cedes (e.g., see (1) where t -~ t ' ) .
Stative inter-vals by default overlap other non-stative or stativeintervals (cf.
\[6\] \[12\]).Last In(r )  is a function defined over dis-course reference intervals, and evaluates to themost recent non-stative vent interval in the dis-course reference interval r, where applicable.
Thisevent interval orients the new event interval e.LastIn(r) corresponds to the "reference time" thatmoves with narrative progression in approacheslike Dowty \[6\] and Hinrichs \[12\].How the  mapp ing  ru les  workTable 1 shows the logical form and the event struc-ture determined by the mapping rules for each sen-tence of (2) (repeated here).(5)a.

Applying the rule for PAST, weobtain t2 ~ T(PERF~), with discourse referenceinterval r2 such that t2 C r2.
SuperNow evalu-ates to Ub, yielding t2 s tar ts_before  Ub.
PERFflis necessarily stative, so by default its event inter-val is assumed to persist up through the present.Thus t2 s tar ts_before  Ub is specialized to t2(m f i )  Ub.
Applying the PERF rule, we obtain t3fl, with discourse reference interval r3 such thatZ3 C r3.

On the event structurerepresentation level, we assume the existence ofaxioms formalizing lexical semantics and other as-pects of commonsense knowledge (e.g., \[13\] [19\]),and call them causal axioms.
Simplified examplesare given in (6) and (7) below.
We use the defaultconditional > introduced by Asher and Morreau\[3\] and used by Lascarides and Oberlander \[19\].

We formalize the effects of structuralinformation in terms of what we call logical formaxioms.
Much as in the case of axioms formaliz-ing commonsense knowledge, logical form axiomscan be defeasible.
Although the effects of struc-tural factors on anaphora interpretation are widelyacknowledged in linguistic theories (e.g., bindingtheory), the interest is more on indefeasible gram-matical principles.
Our logical form axioms en-code grammatically derived defeasible preferences,the kind of structural effects that centering andtemporal centering uncover.We assume the following architecture for sen-tence interpretation.
Once the logical form hasbeen obtained, logical form reasoning takes place.There are two kinds of rules in logical form reason-ing - -  monotonic (or indefeasible) and defeasible.The former rewrite the logical form, and the lat-ter generate logical form hypotheses, that are addi-tional logical form expressions.
All of the hypothe-ses resulting from logical form reasoning, as well asthe original interpretation, are then mapped intoevent structure representations, and causal axiomsare used to complete the interpretation.
All com-plete interpretations of a sentence are comparedto find the best hypothesis.We propose to encode temporal centering asdefeasible logical form axioms that generate logi-cal form hypotheses about the interpretations ofunresolved iscourse reference intervals.
To bemore precise, we claim that the following principleholds:Temporal Property-sharing Principle (TPP)Resolve the current discourse reference intervalrl against a discourse reference interval rj in theattentional state.
By default, ri and rj shouldshare the same properly reflecting the temporalposition in the logical form.This general preference can be encoded bymeans of logical form axioms of the type shownin (8), whose intended interpretation is as follows- -  Let ut tn-1 and uttn be two consecutive ut-terances in discourse, l f (utt )  be a function fromutterances to their logical forms, (PASTrl ?)
bea subformula of l :~(ut tn_ l )  , (PASTr2 ~) be asubformula of i f  (u t t , ) ,  and pos ( l f  1, l f2 )  be afunction from pairs of a formula lfl and a sub-formula lf2 into the "temporal position" of lf2 inlfl.
The temporal position of a subformula in aformula is the sequence of higher temporal oper-ators of the subformula.
For example, in the for-75mula (PAST (PEP~F ?
)), the temporal positionof (PAST (PERF ?))
is the empty sequence (),that of (PERF ?)
is the sequence {PAST), andthat of ?
is the sequence (PAST,PERF).
In a casewhere pos(u.-1,(PASTrl ?)
= pos(u., (PASTr2~)), the TPP generates the hypothesis that thetwo discourse reference intervals r l  and r2 are thesame.consecutive (utt._ 1 ,uttn),pos(If(utt._l), (PASTrl ~)) =(8) pos(lf(uttn), (PASTr2 ~))?.-+uttn : (PASTr2=rl ~)A similar rule generates hypotheses about theidentity of two discourse reference intervals bothintroduced by PERF operators in the same tempo-ral positions.Lascarides and Oberlander \[19\] propose thePenguin Principle as a way of choosing amongconflicts generated by the application of defensiblerules.
The principle says that whenever a conflictbetween rules arises, the hypothesis obtained byapplying the most specific rule should be chosen.The logical form axioms encode general knowledgeof linguistic structures independent from particu-lar events or situations being described.
Thus theinformation they encode is necessarily less specificthan rules encoding lexical inferences and causalrelations.
Hence the following consequences ontheTPP:The TPP applies in the absence of informa-tion about causal relation between the events.Any hypothesis that results from causal rea-soning is preferred over the hypothesis ug-gested by the TPP.This general pattern of interaction betweencausal and logical form axioms predicts the fol-lowing Temporal Centering Principle:Temporal Centering Principle (TCP)  When ?ievokes a set of unresolved iscourse referenceintervals rx,...,rn, each rk is resolved againstthe current atttentional state as follows-- (i) IFcausal axioms generate a hypothesis, take it, (ii)ELSE IF the TPP  generates a hypothesis, takeit, (iii) ELSE rl,.

,  r ,  are new to the discourse.After resolution, rl, ..., rn are in the TCfl in theoutput context of ?i.Case (i) of the TCP allows any of the four transi-tion types, retention, establishment, resumption,or NULL.
A NULL-transition only result onlyfrom negative conclusions obtained from causalaxioms.
Under the TPP  in the form of rule(8) that applies only on consecutive utterances,case (ii) would result in either TCb-retentionor TCb-establishment, but not TCb-resumption.How does this accord with our corpus data dis-cussed earlier?
In the most frequent (65%) TCb-retention, the discourse reference interval evokedby the matrix past tense is identified with an-other evoked by the matrix past tense in the pre-vious utterance.
In the next frequent (15%) TCb-establishment, i  is identified with the one evokedby the subordinate t mporal operator.
This sharpdifference in frequency would be explained by thefact that the TPP supports the former but not thelatter.Webber ' s  example ,  rev is i ted .We now go back to Webber's example (2) and ex-plain how the interactions ofdefensible rules resultin the temporal centering transitions shown in Fig.2.
The input consists of the logical forms from Ta-ble 1.
(2a) For the initial sentence of discourse, only theNULL-transition can apply, r l  is not identified,and remains as an open variable.
AS1 containsTCfl=\[rl\].
(2b) The TPP can apply for PAST; resulting inTCb-establishment, with rl=r2.
As a re-sult, TCf2=\[rl,r3\], TCb2=rl, and the value ofLas t In ( r2 )=Last In ( r l )  is t l .
This yields t lo r ients  t2, where t l  is the transition eventinterval for (~) and t2, for a state (PERF /3).When a non-stative vent interval o r ients  astative event interval, the former is partly cov-ered by (overlaps, starts, finishes, equals, during,or their inverses) the latter by default.
(2c) The TPP, in the form of rule (8), generatesthe hypothesis expressed by the following log-ical form: (PASTr4=rl 'The roses  fail tocheer  her ' ) .
The causal reasoning eneratesthe same conclusion, namely, in order to givesomebody flowers, one has ~o be at somebody'splace, so we conclude that the 'failing-to-cheerevent' continues the "story" of John's goingover to Mary's house.
Either way, we have aTCb-retention, yielding TCf3 =\[rl(=r4)\] andTCb3=rl.
The value of Last In( r4)  is now t l ,yielding t l  o r ients  t4.
Since t l  and t4 areevent intervals for transition events (a and 7),o r ients  defaults to t l  (-<) t4.
(2c') There is a conflict.
While the TPP would sug-gest a continuation of the story of John's visitat Mary's house, the causal rules such as (6)suggest that the event of picking up flowerstakes place at the florist's, and the rules suchas (7) suggest hat being at the florist's resultsfrom the action of "stopping by" the florist's.The Penguin Principle now applies, resulting inTCb-establishment, and t3 (-4) t4.76ConclusionsWe have presented a semantic and pragmatic ac-count of the past tense that uniformly accounts forits discourse anaphoric properties.
We distinguishbetween two kinds of intervals, discourse referenceintervals and event intervals, which allows us toprovide a direct analogy between centering andtemporal centering.We introduce the notion of logical form rea-soning, which obviates the need for tense trees asthe source for structural reasoning, and, at thesame time, enables us to account for the interac-tion between the structural preferences and causalreasoning.
By including in both logical form ex-pressions and event structure representation a ex-plicit indication of the contextual parameters toberesolved, rules can be formulated that exploit thekind of information available at each level.
Wecan therefore factor out different sources of de-feasible preferences in tense interpretation.
Rulesoperating on the logical form formalize the effectsof structural factors, and rules operating on theevent structure formalize the effects of common-sense knowledge.The ordering preferences inour model are con-sistent with data from a large, heterogeneous cor-pus.
In the future work, we need to develop anevaluation method for our model, to specify morefully the knowledge representation a d reasoningneeds, and finally to clarify consequences that ourmodel might have on a more unified model of at-tentional state to simultaneously account for nom-inal and temporal anaphora.AcknowledgementEach author would like to thank the other twoauthors for stimulating discussions and encour-agements.
