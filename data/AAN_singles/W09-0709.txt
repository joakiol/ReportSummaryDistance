The goal of the fieldwork was toevaluate the potential role of automatedtelephony services in improving access toimportant government information andservices.
Our interviews, focus groupdiscussions and surveys revealed thatLwazi, a telephone-based spoken dialogsystem, could greatly support currentSouth African government efforts toeffectively connect citizens to availableservices, provided such services be tollfree, in local languages, and with contentrelevant to each community.1  IntroductionThere is a growing interest in deploying spokendialog systems (SDSs) in developing regions.
Inrural communities of developing regions, whereinfrastructure, distances, language and literacyare barriers to access, but where mobile phonesare prevalent, an SDS could be key to unlockingsocial and economic growth (Barnard et al,2003).
Some notable recent studies in this fieldinclude ?Tamil Market?
(Plauch?
et al, 2006)and ?VoiKiosk?
(Agarwal et al, 2008).
Bothwere kiosk-based SDSs providing agriculturalinformation that were tested in rural, semi-literate communities in India.
Nasfors (2007)also developed an agricultural informationservice, aimed at mobile telephone users inKenya.
?Healthline?
was evaluated by a smallset of community health workers in Pakistan(Sherwani et al, 2007), who had trouble with thevoice-based interface, presumably due to theirlimited literacy.
In a more recent study, Sharmaet al (2008) evaluated a SDS designed forcaregivers of HIV positive children in Botswana.The researchers found that the users performedequally well using touchtone as speech input,when navigating the system.
In the current paper,we expand on this body of work by investigatingthe potential role for SDSs in connecting ruralcitizens of South Africa with governmentservices, such as free education opportunities andstipends.South Africa is the leader in Information andCommunications Technology (ICT) in Africaand has the most developed telecommunicationsnetwork on the continent (SA year book2006/2007: 131).
In particular, mobile phoneusage has experienced massive growth due inpart to its accessibility by non-literate people andits ?leapfrog?
development, which skipped theinterim solutions adopted in the developed world(Tongia & Subrahmanian, 2006).
The amount ofmobile phone users in South Africa is anastonishing 30 million people - out of a totalpopulation of 47 million (Benjamin, 2007).
Thepercentage of both rural and urban householdswith mobile phones tripled from 2001 to 2007,while ?landline?
use declined.
The accessibilityand widespread use of mobile phones makeSDSs a good candidate for low-cost informationaccess.In South Africa, there are eleven officiallanguages.
Private companies, NGOs andgovernment offices who wish to reach SouthAfricans through print or audio, find it extremelycostly to do so for each language.
Heugh (2007)shows that in terms of speakers' proficiency,there is no single lingua franca for SouthAfricans (see Figure 1).
In fact, in 2001, only 3million of 44 million South Africans wereEnglish speakers, the language in which mostgovernment messages are currently disseminated(Household survey 2001).5922.917.914.49.28.68.27.74.42.52.21.50.623.817.613.39.48.28.27.94.42.72.31.60.50510152025isiZuluisiXhosaAfrikaansSepediEnglishSetswanaSesothoXitsongaSiSwatiTshivendaIsiNdebeleOther%19962001Figure 1: Percentage of speakers per language inSouth Africa.Heugh (2007) reports that between 35% and45% of South Africans above the age of 16cannot read or write.
Illiteracy isdisproportionately high for women and forpeople living in the primarily rural provinces:KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.Mobile phone use is widespread in these areasamong semi-literate citizens and speakers of alllanguages.Communities in rural areas struggle to accessgovernment services due to their remotelocations.
Most community members must travellong distances by foot or rare and costly publictransport to access basic services.
In theirlongitudinal household study on costs andcoping strategies with chronic illnesses, Goudgeet al (2007), for example, found that people inrural areas of South Africa do not go to freehealth care facilities because they cannot affordtransport.NGOs face the same challenge when trying toreach rural populations.
Many produceinformation to assist households affected byHIV/AIDS, for example, but most of thematerials are published on websites; the cost ofproviding multilingual print materials is oftentoo high.
Due to low literacy levels, language,and a lack of infrastructure, the informationremains inaccessible to the people who need it,especially those living in rural areas andtownships (Benjamin, 2007).Given the well developed mobile phonenetwork and the relatively sparse alternativeoptions in rural South Africa, the authors believethat multilingual SDSs can provide a low-costsolution to improving the ICT access of citizenswho may currently be excluded fromgovernment services due to language, literacyand location.
However, it is imperative tounderstand the target users and theirenvironmental context as a first step to designingsuch a system (Nielsen, 1993).
In this paper, weprovide background on the current state of ruralgovernment service delivery in South Africa andintroduce the Lwazi project.
We describe ourfield methods, and finally, we present ourfindings from the initial field work with designand deployment implications for the Lwazisystem.2.
BackgroundIn South Africa, rural citizens are faced with alack of economic activities and limited access toresources.
The South African government isaware of both the need to improve citizen accessto services and the specific challenges that ruralcommunities face.In this section, we note two successful ruralinitiatives of the South African government(Section 2.1) and we describe Lwazi (Section2.2), a SDS designed to augment government?saccessibility by eligible citizens.2.1 Rural Initiatives in South AfricaTwo national efforts that are successfullyconnecting rural South African citizens togovernment services are (1) The ThusongService Centres (TSCs) and (2) CommunityDevelopment Workers (CDWs).Thusong Service Centres (TSCs), formerlyknown as MPCC (Multi-Purpose CommunityCentres), were initiated in 1999 as a nationalinitiative to integrate government services intoprimarily rural communities, where services andparticipation by citizens was limited due to thelong distances they needed to travel (TSC 2008).In June 7, 2008, the 100th TSC was opened.
EachTSC is a one-stop centre providing integratedservices and information from government torural community members close to where theylive.Community Development Workers (CDWs)were formed in 2004 as a national initiative tofurther bridge the gap between governmentservices and eligible citizens, especially the ruralpoor (CDW 2008).
CDWs are members of ruralcommunities who are trained and employed bythe Department of Public Service andAdministration (DPSA) under the office of thepresidency.
They work within their communitiesand coordinate with municipal and provincialoffices.
The primary responsibilities of a CDW is60to keep informed, notify citizens about events,and inform them about services for which theyare eligible then follow up to ensure theysuccessfully receive these services.2.2 Project LwaziAs part of the ICT initiative, an ambitious, three-year project is currently being conducted by theHuman Language Technology (HLT) researchgroup under the Meraka institute, at the Councilfor Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) inSouth Africa.
This project is funded by the SouthAfrican Department of Arts and Culture todevelop a multilingual telephone-based SDS thatwould assist South African government servicedelivery.
?Lwazi,?
derived from the IsiZuluword for knowledge, aims to make a positiveimpact in the daily lives of South Africans byconnecting them to government and healthservices (Lwazi, 2008).
The ability of SDSs toovercome barriers of language, literacy, anddistances led the Lwazi team to explore a low-cost application that would support the currentrural initiatives mentioned in 2.1.3.
MethodFirst, we consulted previous research ondevelopment and technology in South andSouthern Africa.
We reviewed the most recentcensus conducted (Statistics SA, 2007) for dataon infrastructure, income, language, andtechnology use.Then, eleven communities were visited bysmall, interdisciplinary teams of researchers overa period of 3 months in 2008.
Of these elevencentres, two were in peri-urban societies anothertwo in urban and the rest were based in ruralcommunities (Table 1).
In each visit, the Lwaziteam gained access to the community throughthe Thusong Service Centres (TSC?s) manager.These individuals provided materials, officespace, and meetings with CDWs and key peopleat the TSC.We conducted between one and five keyinformant interviews at each site with the TSCemployees, CDWs, and community members.
Infour of the eleven sites, we also conducted afocus group discussion.
In two sites, weshadowed a CDW during a typical day.
Wevisited farms, day-care centres, churches,markets, youth centres, clinics, businesses andhouseholds.Community Type TSC CDWsSterkspruit Rural Yes YesTshidilamolomo Rural Yes YesBotshabelo Peri-urban Yes YesKgautswane Rural Yes YesWaboomskraal Peri-urban Yes NoDurban Urban No NoOrhistad Rural Yes YesSediba  Rural Yes YesAtteridgeville Urban  Yes YesLaingsburg  Rural  Yes YesVredendal  Rural  Yes  YesTable 1: Sites visited in Spring 2008.Data collection in these communities wasprimarily to investigate the suitability of theLwazi SDS and to determine key user andcontextual factors that would drive its design.
Inparticular, we sought to:?
Gather rural community information needs.?
Investigate how people currently getinformation.?
Determine which cultural factors wouldimpact the Lwazi system.?
Determine level of technical competency.?
Gauge interest in a low-cost SDS thatimproves access to government services.4.
ResultsIn this section, we present our overall resultsfrom field visits in eleven communities of SouthAfrica (Section 4.1).
In particular, we report onfactors that influence the design and potentialuptake of the Lwazi system in this context: theinformation needs and sources (Section 4.2),cultural and social factors (Section 4.3),suitability of the technology (Section 4.4), anduser experience (Section 4.5).4.1  Overall ResultsThe eleven communities we visited were locatedthroughout seven of the nine provinces of SouthAfrica.
They varied greatly in availableinfrastructure and languages spoken.
They sharedan economic dependency on nearby cities and, in61some cases, reported social problems.
Thesecommunities also share a dependency ongovernment social grants.During interviews and focus groupdiscussions with government employees andcommunity members, interviewees identifiedwhat they perceived as the primary problems intheir communities.
Across all eleven sitesvisited, unemployment was most often reportedas the primary problem (Figure 2).
In fact, ourteam observed that in at least 8 of the sitesvisited, the community's livelihood was entirelysustained by government grants.After unemployment, access to health andsocial services was viewed as a primary problemin six of the sites visited.
Crime and substanceabuse were also reported as communityproblems.Primary problems in the 11 communities visited618540123456789Accesstoservicessuchashealth,socialOrphansUnemploymentCrimeAlcoholanddrugabuseType of problemNumberofcommunitiesFigure 2: Number of the eleven communitiesthat site these as primary problems in thecommunity, as reported by interviewees.There are four mobile providers in South Africanamely Cell-C, MTN, Virgin Mobile andVodacom.
The two landline companies, Neo-telland Telkom are not familiar in the communitiesvisited by Lwazi team.
Community membersprefer and use mobile phones because of ease ofuse and accessibility.
Figure 3 illustrates the useof mobile providers in the eleven visitedcommunities.Mobile provider in communities visited024681012Cell-C MTN Virgin VodacomMobile providersNumberofcommunitiesFigure 3: Mobile provider in communitiesvisited4.2.
Information Needs and SourcesThe majority of communities visited reportedlack of economic activity as the primary problemin the community, and as could be expected, weobserved very high levels of unemployment.Grants are offered by the South Africangovernment to address the imbalance andstimulate the economy of these areas.
There aresix types of grants, namely: War Veteran grant,Old Age grant, Disability grant, Caredependency grant, Foster care grant and Childsupport grant.
Citizens can apply for these attheir nearest local South African social securityagency (SASSA) or district office.Figure 4 shows that all eleven communitiesvisited received Vukuzenzele magazine, amonthly government information sharingmedium.
This is however not effective in thesecommunities where literacy levels are low.
This,as mentioned earlier, is one of the problems thegovernment is trying to address.
The secondcommonly used source of information was theCDWs.
This is a useful source because they arethe ?foot soldiers?
of the government; they areresponsible for door to door visits, collecting anddelivering information.Sources of government information024681012CDWPublicmeetingslocal radiostationinlocal languagePrintmediaGovernmentprint(includingVukuzenzele)Sources of informationNumberofcommunitiesFigure 4: sources of government informationAt the time of the visits, the eleven communitiesreceived information from the Thusong ServiceCentres.
Government departments, NGOs,municipalities and research institutes such theCSIR, used the TSCs as a platform todisseminate information.
At a more grass rootslevel, African communities in South Africa shareinformation by word of mouth.
Local radiostations and newspapers in local languages arealso important sources of information.4.3 Cultural and Social FactorsThe population in the communities we visitedconsists mostly of older people taking care ofgrandchildren whose parents work in nearby62cities and visit only once or twice a year.
As wehave previously mentioned, the lack of economicactivity means that these communities dependheavily on government social grants.
Olderpeople in these communities are often unable toread and write.
In some cases, their low literacylevels and possible unfamiliarity withtechnology restricts their ability to use thecheaper ?texting?
feature of their mobile phones.In the communities we visited, ten out of theeleven official South African languages werespoken.
Each community typically spoke two ormore languages.
A Lwazi system that deliversinformation about SASSA services would bemore accessible to the older, rural populationthan current print methods; the proposed systemwould support a majority of the elevenlanguages in order to offer a better informationchannel.4.4 Suitability of TechnologyThe research prior to the design of the Lwazisystem investigated how to ensure that theproposed system will be suitable to the lifestyleof the community to be served.
We do knowthat currently, communities have other means ofaccessing government information, including thefree ?Vukuzenzele?
monthly magazine and localradio stations.
Like these current means, Lwazimust be free in order to be effective and it mustcontain content that is locally-relevant to theseperi-urban and rural communities.
Governmentdepartments will find Lwazi to be a very usefuland low-cost way of disseminating theirinformation.
Rural South Africans will benefitfrom the alternative source of criticalinformation.4.5 User ExpertiseWe also sought to evaluate the current expertiseof potential Lwazi system users with telephonyand other ICT technologies.
The user expertiseof telephony systems differ between young andold.
As mentioned earlier, households have atleast one cell phone.
The older members of thecommunity use it to call and receive calls fromfriends and children in neighbouring urban areas.They do not know how to send text messages.Some children have saved the full ?Please callme?
line as a quick dial so that their elder familymembers can just press it in cases of emergency.The young people on the other hand are wellversed with telephony technology.
Most of themare also familiar with the basic use of acomputer, despite their limited access to them.The Lwazi system must be as simple as making aphone call to a friend or relative in order to beaccessible to all.
In most households, however,there is someone who is technically competent.Based on our fieldwork and recent user studies ofSDSs in developing regions, a Lwazi systemcould be useable in the rural context of SouthAfrica, especially among the elderly and thosewho do not read and write.5.
Discussion5.1 Potential UptakeWe saw two main areas where a telephonyservice could be very useful.
The first is insupporting communication between communityand government.
For example, a multilingual,automated service could direct calls fromcommunity members to the appropriate TSCoffice or CDW, or perhaps provide locally-relevant information such as office hours ofoperation, directions to the office, and eligibilityrequirements for services.
Such a service mightreduce the amount of calls that a TSC office orCDW would need to take personally.
It couldalso likely save a community member a trip ifthey were sure beforehand what paperwork theyneeded to bring and when the office was open.
Itis important to mention here that the project willrequire a buy-in from the local councillors of thecommunities we will be piloting in.The second area in which a telephony servicecould be useful would be in facilitating internalcommunication among government serviceproviders.
CDWs may need to meet communitymembers face to face whenever possible.Coordinating with government staff across themunicipality, district, province, or country couldhappen remotely and efficiently if governmentstaff could use an automated telephony service tosend audio messages to several staff members atonce.
The national coordinator for CDWs, forexample, could notify every CDW in the countryof upcoming events and policy changes with asingle phone call.Many government officials, includingThusong centre managers, felt the system mightassist them in communicating with thecommunities they serve.
There was, however, aconcern from one site that there are sections ofthe population that do not have mobile63connection or a reliable source of electricity tocharge their phones.
These could be thecommunities that need government services themost.
In these cases, Lwazi will have to play asupportive role to the existing services providedby the CDWs, rather than allowing direct accessby community members.Our field work revealed the effectiveness ofnational government programs to connect ruralcitizens to available government services.
Ourmajor finding was that although particulars aboutthe communities differed, individuals in theeleven communities visited experienced barriersto information access that could be mitigatedwith automated telephony services, provided thatsuch services are toll free and localized to thelanguage and information relevant to theparticular rural community.
Whereasinfrastructure such as roads, services, and insome cases, electricity were limited, the mobilephone network of South Africa is reliable andwidespread.
We feel optimistic that the Lwazisystem will build on the available infrastructureto transcend the barriers of geography andimprove the connection between citizens andservices.5.2 ChallengesIn a large and culturally diverse country such asSouth Africa, deploying a SDS intended toprovide universal access is a great challenge.Designing for any given user group oftenrequires a multiple iterations of testing and userfeedback.
Our fieldwork revealed a diverse set ofend users; a successful design will require agreater investment in time and resource to gatherdetailed and accurate information about ruralSouth Africans.
Although we plan to rely on ourpartners (TSC and CDWs) on the ground for agreat deal of this information, we believe it is anambitious goal to expect deployment of theLwazi project  in eleven languages country wideby summer 2009.Not only is the technological aspect veryambitious, this kind of national governmentsponsored system requires tactful managementof stakeholders.
The success of the Lwazi projectrelies on community members, governmentpartners, researchers, NGO's, and corporateinterests, all of whom have conflicting needs andinterests.
Our team recognizes the importance ofmanaging stakeholder interests and has devised aproblem structuring method to facilitatefeedback and discussion (Plauch?
et al,submitted).Community buy-in is critical to the success ofan ICT deployment.
We found not only that theTSC and CDW national coordinators but alsoeach of the communities visited were all excitedabout the potential of the proposed system.Generally, rural communities are comfortablewith the use of a mobile phone.
But there is anage difference in preference of differentapplications.
Because Lwazi is voice-based, thesenior citizens of the community will be morelikely to be excited about it than the youngergenerations.
Younger South Africans arecomfortable with the cheaper, text interface tomobile phones.
We recognise that Lwazi may notsuit the needs of all South Africans, but we aimto make it accessible to those who arehistorically excluded.
In doing so, we hope tohave an overall impact in this country where only26% of the population has a Matric or tertiaryeducation (Stats SA, 2007).6.
ConclusionIn this paper we evaluated the potential role ofLwazi, a proposed telephone-based SDS, inimproving rural access to important governmentservices.
The Lwazi project will create an openplatform for telephone-based services forgovernment to provide information in all elevenlanguages.
Lwazi will be especially useful if itcan reduce cost or the distances that people travelto access government services and that thedistances that government workers travel tocheck in with municipal offices.
Our team plansto conduct pilots in two communities in thesummer of 2009.
A successful pilot in one ofthese communities will then burgeon into anational service for all South Africans toempower themselves through improved access toinformation, services and government resources.ReferencesAditi Sharma, Madelaine Plauch?, Etienne Barnard,Christiaan and Kuun.
