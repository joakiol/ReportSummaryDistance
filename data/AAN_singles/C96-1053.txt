co. jpAbst ractThis paper presents a practical method for a globalstructure analyzing Mgorithm of Japanese long sen-tences with lexical information, a method which wecall Lexical Discourse Grammar (LDG).
This methodassumes that .Japanese function words, such as con-junctive particles (postpositions) located at the end ofeach clause, have modality and suggest global struc-tures of Japanese long sentences in cooperation withmodality within predicates or auxiliary verbs.
LDGclassifies the encapsulating powers of function wordsinto six levels, and modality in predicates into fourtypes.
LDG presumes tile inter-clausal dependencywithin Japanese sentences prior to syntactic and se-mantic analyses, by utilizing the differences of the en-capsulating powers each Japanese function word has,and by utilizing modification preference between func-tion words and predicates that reflects consistency ofmodality in them.
In order to confirm the encapsula-tion power of Japanese function words, we analyzed thespeech utterances of a male announcer and found thecorrelation between a particle's encapsulating powerand the pause length inserted after the clause with aconjunctive particle.1 In t roduct ionWhen analyzing long sentences with two or more pred-icates (i.e.
compound and complex sentences), it is dif-ficult to grasp the proper structure of sentences hav-ing a large nmnber of possible dependency (modifier-modifee relation) structures.
This difficulty is moremarked in Japanese than in English, since there aremore syntactically ambiguous structures in Japanese.Tile Japanese language has few syntactic indicators fordividing sentences into phrases or clauses, unlike En-glish with its relative pronouns and subordinate con-junctions.
One of the most critical features of Japaneseis that the difference between a phra~se and a clause isnot cleat'.
Even subjects or other obligatory elementsof clauses are omitted very often when they aye indi-cated by contexts.
In addition, the Japanese languagedoes not have any parts of speech to clearly indicateeither the beginning or end of a phrase or a clause.Another critical feature is that the Japanese languageis an almost pure Head-final language, i.e., predicatesand function words to signify the sentence structure ap-pear at the end of the clause or sentence.
This meansthat it is syntactically possible for all phrases or clausesthat can modit) predicates to modify all other phrasesor clauses that appear in the latter part of long sen-tences.These syntactic haracteristics of the Japanese lan-guage make it difficult to determine the dependency(modification) structure of hmg sentences.
Simpleparsing of Japanese long sentences inevitably producesa huge number of possible modification structures.
Aconventional bottom-up arsing method can reduceambiguity in modification by local information in timsurface structure.
However, this inclines toward animproper output, since the locally highest likelihood issometimes low on the whole.To overcome this problem, several methods to pre-dict the global structure of long sentences have beenproposed.
One is a top-down parsing method bymatching the input sentence and the domain-specificpatterns (Furuse et al, 1992).
Improvements made byother researchers enabled this method to parse irregu-lar, incomplete and multiplex patterns, by describingthe domain-dependent pa terns in the form of gram-mar (Doi, Muraki, et M., 1993).Another method employs global structure presump-tion to divide a sentence into clauses by utilizinggeneral exical information.
It predicts the sentencestructure prior to syntactic analysis only by utilizingdomain-independent lexical information such as con-junctive particles, parallel expressions, theme transi-tion, etc.
(Mizuno et al, 1990; Kurohashi et al, 1992).Lexical Discourse Grammar (LDG) is one of theapproaches with which a global structure of a longsentence is presumed by focusing on function words(Kamei et al 1986; Doi et al, 1991).
LDG assumesthat Japanese function words, such as conjunctive par-tides (postpositions) located at the end of each clause,convey modMity, or propositional ttitude, and suggestglobal structures of Japanese long sentences in cooper-ation with modality in predicates, especially within310auxiliary verbs.
LDG can presume the inter-clausal de-i)endency within Japanese sentences prior to syntacticand semantic alLalyses by utilizing tilt; difDrences ofthe encapsulating powers each ,\]apaiLese function wordhas, and by utilizing modification preference-betweenfunction words and predicates that reflects consistency(if lnodality reading or propositional attitude inte, rpre-tation.LDG is effective in reducing the syntactic ambigu-ities, and it him alre~My been applied to a machinetranslation system.

Japanese relative notln8, such as "lnae" (\]ii'j::before) are another type of nouns that play roles sim-il;~r to those of conjunctions in English when they aremoditied by predicative phrases or clauses.2.2 Modality in Conjunctive Particlesand Modification PreferencesThe conjunction lewis we introduced above reduce thesyntactic ambiguities of long sentences.
However, inorder to select the most reliable struchtre of sentences,we use another important discourse feature tile con-junctive pt~rticles have, i.e., modMity.LDG assumes Japanese function words have moda\]-ity or ~proposidonal attitudes' ~md suggest global,~tructures of Japanese hmg sentences in cooperationwith modality within ~mxiliary verbs.

From the parsing viewpoint, this suggests thateach conjunctive particle has modification preferencewith certain predicates or auxiliary verbs.From the viewpoint of modality, there are four pred-icate types in Japanese; (1) Auxiliary verbs of the first-type modality (conjecture tc.
), (2) Auxiliary verbs ofthe second-type modality (necessity etc.
), (3) Copula,and (4) Plain (present and past tense) forms of Verbs.Here, first-type modality includes conjecture, such as"darou"(f2"7~ ")) which corresponds to 'may,' 'can,''maybe,' and 'possibly' in English auxiliary verbs, ad-verbs, and adjectives.
Second-type modality includesnecessity, such as "nakereba-naranai" (re t~ fc t:ft3 6to?
u,) and "ta-hou-ga-yoi"(t: t! ")
~3: u~) which corre-spond to 'have to' or 'must,' and 'had better,' 'should,'or 'preferably' in English.
The Japanese Copula "da"(?Z) or "desu" (~?
'Y) means definition or speaker'sjudgment with confidence.
Phdn forms of verbs arethe present or past tense forms of verbs without anymodal auxiliary verbs.
These forms do not have anymodal morpheme, but when they which appear at theend of the sentence and are followed by a period theyCAN convey modality, that is, attitudes or intentionsof the subject or speaker.
Plain forms of verbs in arelative clause which modify a nominal phrase do nothave such modMity.LDG assumes that each conjunctive particle has apreference in modifying predicates or auxiliary verbswith consistent modMity.
There are six levels of modal-ity in conjunctive particles, and there are four types ofmodality in predicates, as mentioned above.
A sub-ordinate clause with modality modifies a consistentmodality predicate type.
The following figure illus-trates the modality consistency between particles andauxiliary verbs in Japanese sentences.
{Clause + particle}Modality{Clause + auxiliary verb}ModalityTake the Japanese conjunction oun "toki" (1~ =when, if) for example.
This word corresponds to ei-ther the English conjunction 'when' with neutral read-ing or 'if' with conjecture modality.
When the word"toki" is used as the 'if' reading, this word modifiesa clause in which the modality is expressed.
In mostcases, auxiliary verbs such as "darou" (?Z,5 ") = may,maybe) or "ta-hou-ga-yoi"(t~ It 5 7~3: ~ = had better,should, preferably) express the modality of the modifeeclause.
The Japanese language has some words thatindicate or emphasize the fact that the word "toki" isbeing used as the "if" reading.
One of them is the ad-verb "moshi" (~o L) that indicates a supposition read-ing is applicable.
This adverb is never used by itselfand always modifies conjunctive forms such as "toki,""nara," "to," and so on, and selects or emphasizes thesupposition reading of the conjunctive forms.
Anothersuch word is the particle "w?'
(~:t) , which is usuallyused as a topic marker for a sentence.
When "wa" isattached to "toki," that is, in the form of "toki-wa,"the supposition reading is enhanced.
This tendencyis strengthened by the use of comma after the phrase"toki-wa."
The phrase "toki-w?'
tends to be used tomodify phrases with auxiliary verbs of modality.When this phrase with modality modifies a plainform of a verb with a period at the end of the sentence,the readers recognize that the plain form of the verbcontains a kind of modality, such as the subject's orspeaker's intention.
In other words, modality informa-tion of the subordinate clauses is attached to the plainform of the main verb.
The following figure illustratesthis interpreting mechanism.312\[ Input Sentence Reader\[ Morphological Analysis\[ Discourse Structure Reference\[ Discourse Structure Assumption<=> ~ict ionary IDiscourse Form Preservation \[Discourse Structure Analysis\[ Synta.ctic & Sem~mtic AnalysisFigure 1 Analysis based on LDG(Modality}--1{Clause + particle} {Clause (Phdn form).
}ModalityIn contrast, when a subordinate clause does not havemodality explicitly and modifies a clause with modal-ity, the readers interpret he subordinate clause as thatwith a kind of modality such as conjecture.
The fol-lowing figure illustrates this situation.?
(Modality){Clause + particle}1{Clause + auxiliary verb}ModalityThe modality coincidence described in this sectionis the base for analyzing Japanese long sentences.
The.Japanese language has few syntactic indicators to showthe segments of sentences, but is rich in semantic indi-cators which suggest sentence structure.
The sem,~n-tic indicators are the modalities that a wide range ofparts of speech have.
Conjunctive particles, adverbs,and even plain forms of verbs can have modMity in theJapanese btnguage.
The modality structure is the keyto comprehending Japanese long sentences.2.3 Japanese Sentence Structure Pre-sumptionWe assume that the modality structure (:an mMnly bedetected by lexical intbrmation.
Based on this assump-tion, LDG presumes the sentence structure before syn-tactic and semantic analyses on the ba~sis of previouslycollected lexical information that characterizes the lex-ical discourse.Figure 1 shows the configuration of our Japaneselong sentence analyzer based on LDG.
Input sentencesare first analyzed morphologically.
The part 'DiscourseStructure Analysis' in Fig.
1 then presumes the sen-tence structure, before syntactic and semantic analysis.ttere, 'Discourse' means an inner-sentence ongruencein Japanese long sentences thttt contain two or morepredicates.In order to reduce the huge number of syntacticstructures of Japanese hmg sentences and give priori-ties to each possible structure, the analyzing methodbased on LDG uses global modality structure focusingon lexic~tl information.First, the Discourse Structure Reference module re-duces the number of possible syntactic structures, us-ing the level of conjunctive particles described in theprevious ection.
After that, the Discourse StructureAssumption module gives priorities to each possiblesyntactic structure, using the modification prefl;rencebased on modality.3 An Appl icat ion of LDG3.1 Pause Control with LDGThe level of conjunctive particles, which indicates thestructure of the Japanese long sentences, is the mostimportant feature of LDG.
In this section we applythe level to another linguistic phenomenml in order to('onfirm the validity of this model.The sentence structure influences a wide range oflinguistic phenomena.
One example is prosodic infor-mation (Dorffner et al, 1990; Iwata et al, 1990; Kaikiet al, 1990; Sakai et al, 1990).
If the correct sentencestructure is acquired for each input sentence, prosodicinformation can be accurately calculated.
As yet,even the most up-to-date, advanced systems have notachieved the analysis in the deep structure, thereforesentence structure presumption in the surface struc-ture is essentiM for a robust prosodic control system.LDG meets this requirement since it presumes the sen-tence structure by means of function words occurringon the surface (Doi, Kamei, et al, 1993).
Hereafter,we propose the prosodic ontrol system based on LDG.The presumption function ibr sentence structure(lexical discourse) by LDG is applied to pre-processing313Table 2 Pause length dataConjunction LevelsWith a comma Without a commaNumber of casesLEV.

It is also possible to consider the pauselength inserted after each clause in relation to the lex~ical information in LDG.
In other words, pauses aremore fl'equently inserted after the clause of the higherconjunction levels than those of the lower levels.
Cornsequently, the pause length and location can be moreefficiently controlled with the LDG conjunction levels.To develop a text-to-speech onversion system withLDG, it is necessary to prepare the LDG conjunctionlevel information of a large nmnber of conjunct equiv-alents such as conjunctive particles.
Statistical datashould also be collected fi'om human speech and read-ing, in regard to the correlations between pause lengthand the LDG conjunction levels.
This substantial datais added to the lexical information to be used for speechsynthesis in cooperation with pronunciation and ac-cent.3.2 Data  AnalysisTo confirm the correlation between the conjunctionlevel and the pause length, we have analyzed speechdata spoken by a professional news announcer (male),reading newspapers and magazines at a regular speed.Wc extracted conjunctive particles and verbs, auxiliaryverbs and adjectives in adverbial form from the speechdata, and classified these words by the LDG conjunc-tion level.
The average pause length for each level wascalculated for two separate cases; words preceding acomma and words without a comma.
See Figure 2 andTable 2.For words without a cormna (marked with white barsin Fig.
2), the result shows that the higher the con-junction level is, the longer the average pause length is(except for LEV.0, which is a particle for quotation).This tendency basically does not depend on whetheror not a comma exists after the words.
However, forwords with a comma (marked with black bars in Fig.
2)pause length of Lev.
3 is shorter than that of Lev.
4.We suppose that the reason for this phenomenon isthat a comma adds modality to the words and length-ens the pauses, as described in the previous section.Taking the comma effect into consideration, we canconclude that there is a solid correlation between theLDG conjunction level and the pause length.LEV.0 ("to"(&) and "tte"(o'C)functioning in asimilar way as quotation marks), however, requires acareful observation.
This conjunction level, the highestrank, can contain every element, even an independentsentence.
In this case, the relation between the con-junctive particle and its preceding clause is so weakthat a pause tends to be inserted BEFORE the con-junctive particle, not after it.
Therefore, in the presentdata, a pause was inserted after the particle in only onecase out of seven.LEV.0LEV.

These groupsare difficult to allocate to a single level, as dmy areused in expressing many factors such its parataxis,cause, means~ attendant circumstances, and becausethey vary semantically and syntactically.
However, inreference to the pause length data, the adverbial verbsill the former group might fall into LEV.1 or LEV.2,while those in the latter group with "te"(-\[) mightfull into LEV.4 or LEV.5.
Conventionally, these twogroups; are often treated as one "adverbial form", al-dlough many functional diiferences have been pointedout between them.
Our data supports the differencewith respect o the pause length.
There are identicaltendenci~ between two adw;rbial forms of adjectives:("-k,F'(~//) and "-kute"(~ a 9=)) and two adverbialforms of pseudo adjectives: ("-ni"(~-=-) and "-de"(r)).4 Concluding RemarksWe have proposed a practical method for a globalstructure anMyzing algorithm of Japanese long sen-tences with lexical information (Lexical DiscourseGrammar: LDG).
This model assumes that Japaneseconjunctive particles convey modality, and modalitystructure can basically be detected by lexical informa-tion.
We assign a ~conjunction level' to each conjunc-tive particle and reduce the number of possible syntac-tic structures of Japanese long sentences.
In addition,we assume that all conjunctive particles have a mod-ification preference according to their modality.
Thispreference assigns priorities to the possible structuresof tile sentences.We applied LDG to a prosodic information controlmethod in a Japanese text-to-speech onversion systemto confirm the conjunction level experimentally.
Thismethod controls pause location and length in speechsynthesis with the conjunction level in LDG, using onlylexical information with no need fi~r syntactic analy-sis.
Even so, it can tune tile pause length more finelythan methods without sentence structure presumption.AnMyzing speech data, we confirmed a correlation be-tween the level of a function word and the length ofa pause inserted ai'~er that word.
We are now in theprocess of developing a speech synthesis ystem withthis method, by defining the default pause length foreach conjunction level.
In future research, LDG willalso be applied to other prosodic information (rhythmand intonation).There can be little doubt that LDG will be moreetfective when two or nmre conjunct equivalents ofdif-ferent levels appear in one sentence, since the LDG con-junction levels are closely related to the inter-clausaldependency.
Unfortur~ately there were few such casesin the data used in this paper.
In future work, we willcollect such data to proove this hypothesis, in so doingwill refine our method to improveits ability to analyzelong Japanese sentences.References\[1\] S. Doi, K. Muraki and S. Kamei.
