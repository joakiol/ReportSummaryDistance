68a, Brno 602 00, Czech Republicparilova@mail.muni.czAbstractThe  requirements  of  user  interface  fordyslexics  have  not  been  yet  properlyexplored.
Accessibility  to  any  kind  ofinformation  or  just  to  entertainment  webpages  is  a  key  factor  to  equality  of  rights,moreover  it  breaks  down  social  barriers.Considering  that  study  materials  arenowadays  very  much  accessible  throughinternet,  by accommodating  web  content  toanyhow  disabled  users  must  be  seen  asnatural  thing.
Dyslexia  is  considered  as  ancognitive  impairment  arising  from  visualsimilarity  of  letters,  therefore  we  focus  onCzech  language  which  uses  specialcharacters.
The  aim  of  our  research  is  tointroduce an application that allows dyslexicsto  decode  text  easier  and  understand  itproperly.1 IntroductionUnlike  for  blind  or  deaf  people,  it  is  quitedifficult  to identify requirements for users withdyslexia,  as  they  are  very  individual.
Thedyslexics'  inability  to  decode  information  issocially  restrictive  as  much  as  the  inability  ofvisually  impaired  to  read  the  information(Deibel,  2006).
For more,  missing one sense isbalanced  by  higher  sensitivity  of  other  senses.But dyslexics do not miss a sense.According  to  psycho-linguistic  studies(Marshall and Newcombe, 1973; Friedman et al.,2012), the words in text should not contain moreletters  (or  letters  close  to  each  other)  that  arevisually similar.
It counts letters like b, p, d, o, qetc.
Also,  dyslexics  find  very  hard  encodingwords that are too long for them.
Such a wordshould  be  broken  up  by  linguistic  or  visualsyllable, depending on the order of problematicsymbols.
In Czech language it might be: nej-roz-??-?e-n?j-??
instead of nejroz???en?j??
(?the mostwidely  used?,  by  linguistic  syllable,  too  longword),  kap-oun instead of  ka-poun etc.
(?fish?,visually).
The finding, reported in Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences (Siok et al.,2008) surprisingly shows that there is significantdifference in ability to decode words in differentlanguages.2 Related WorkThe  main  elements  causing  reading  inabilitydwells  in  visual  attention  deficit  and  letterconcentration,  both  based  in  neural  cognition.Research that was done with eye tracker showsthat  at  least  one  third  of  probands  havedifficulties  with  catching  text  with  eyes(Bellocchi  et  al.,  2013).
The  same  results  areindicated in independent study of Laboratory forvisual Learning at the Smithsonian AstrophysicalObservatory (Schneps et al., 2013).For  instance  mobile  application  AmericanWordspeller  & Phonetic Dictionary helps usersto  check  their  writing  and  converts  phoneticspelling into the proper one.
Other software thatuse text to speech conversion,  so that users donot  have  to  deal  with  visual  matter,  are  WebReader and CapturaTalk.
In  past  year,  IDEAL,the  e-book  reader  was  introduced  by  Rello(2012).
Anyway, this application is not a solutionfor modifying  too long words or words with acombination of wrong letters.
Moreover, Czechlanguage  is  too  complicated  to  get  by  withIDEAL application.Most  of  the  applications  use  text  to  speechconversion  approach  for  its  usefulness  andsimplicity.
However,  reading  should  not  beavoided  by  dyslexics.
The  research  study9conducted  by  experts  from  the  Institute  ofEducation,  University  of  London  shows  thatreading strenghts attention,  brain cognition andinformation  processing  over  time  (Battye  andRainsberry,  2013).
Therefore,  an  applicationbased on text modification is very much needed.3 The Complexity of the CzechLanguageCzech language belongs to West Slavic languageclass.
It is inflected language, characterized by acomplicated  system  of  declension  andconjugation.
According to the complexity and ahuge  vocabulary,  the  use  of  applications  forinstance  offering  synonyms  seems  not  usable.The  declension  and  conjugation  that  affectsnouns  and  verbs  are  grammatical  tasks  thatmakes  the  language  and  assistive  applicationsmost complicated.3.1  DeclensionCzech speakers typically refer to the noun casesby  number  and  learn  them  by  means  of  thequestion   and  answer  (?aur,  2004).
Thesenumbers  do  not  necessarily  correspond  tonumbered  cases  in  other  languages.
Nouns,adjectives,  pronouns and numbers are declined,there  are  seven  cases  over  a  number  ofdeclension models (Tab.
1).3.2  ConjugationConjugation applies to verbs.
It  is  a  system ofgrammatically-determined  modifications.
Thereare  several  types  of  conjugation  with  more  orless  complicated  rules.
A  brief  overview is  inTab.

5Irregular Verbs3.3  Phonetical and Grammatical SyllablesCzech language, as it was stated, is a quit hardlanguage  with  many  words  that  followdeclension  and  conjugation.
It  is  still  underlinguistic  concern  how  to  divide  syllables  inCzech words.
There are rules that often do notfollow natural feelings of those speaking Czech,respectively  those  whose  Czech  is  a  motherlanguage  (Moravec-Robur,  1939).
Automaticsyllabication  is  therefore  still  not  flawless  andthere may be accidental errors that would makedyslexics  even  more  confused.
Moreover,phonological syllable does not omit proximity ofproblematic letters that are hardly decodable.4 Methodology4.1  Experimental ApproachWe introduce  an  application  that  modifies  textaccording  to  needs  of  Czech  languageenvironment.Because  the  complexity  of  words  depends  onindividual  language,  we  have  to  find  out  thepattern  that  makes  the  Czech  words  hard  todecode.
We  prepare  sets  of  text,  one  that  isoriginal  and  contains  general,  non-scientificwords, one that divides the letters according tolinguistic syllables and the last one that dividesthe letters in words according to visual syllables.10Figure 1.
The three texts read by dyslexics.Each set has 3 texts which are similar in length.To  avoid  subjectivity,  the  proband  cannot  betested with same text but we need the texts to besimilar  as  much  as  possible  (Fig.
1).
Thedyslexics read the three texts, not told what theaim of the experiment is.
We measure how fastthe dyslexic read each text while the text is readloudly to avoid distorting elements like skippingletters, returning etc.
The text with phonological(grammatical) syllables divides the letters only inwords they appear in.
For exact measurement weuse  a  system  reacting  on  sound  so  while  thedyslexic start  reading, the tool starts measuringand stops when the last letter is read.4.2   Technical ApproachAmong  observation,  we  need  a  tool  that  willdetect long words and visually similar letters inthe  words  (according  to  above  mentionedpattern).
For modifying the text we use syntacticanalyzer that looks for symbols given in a rulethat  was  set  according  to  general  text  readingproblems.
For instance, a diagram using cyclicalalgorithm  defines  the  way  to  detect  suchwords/letters (Fig.
2).
The tool will be built upusing state machine.To  the  system  in  Figure  2,  if  NIS  is  forexample ?
2, the word is possibly hard to decodeand has to be broken up into syllables or visuallynot similar groups of letters.
For instance a word?podobn??
has more  than 2 problematic  lettersclose  to  each  other  (there  are  5  problematicletters  together  ?
p+o+d+o+b)  so the letters  inthe word should be broken up at least after twoof such letters (po-do-bn?
), better after each ofthe letter (p-o-d-o-bn?
), depending on preset rulefor  each  language.
The  same  way  we  detectnumber of letters contained in a single word.Figure  2.
Cyclical  algorithm  for  detectingproblematic words.The  only  need  is  to  determine  what  letters,respectively  what  pair  or  triplet  of  letters  areproblematic  for  exact  language.
Once  theobservation  is  done,  the  application  we  designcan be used for any language.5 Scientific and Practical ImpactBased on previous work that was done in area ofdyslexic  users,  within  psychological,  linguisticand  technical  studies,  we  strongly  believe  thatour solution fits best to dyslexics who are veryindividual  users  to  work  with.
There  are  nostandards,  like  WCAG  2.0  for  generalaccessibility that would make web designers andICT developers to follow such needs.
First, theywould have to care about accommodating theseneeds in every single webpage, ebook, ICT tool.It  seems  impossible,  too  hard  and  timeconsuming.
Second,  designers  and  developershave  almost  none  of  experience  with  dyslexicusers  and  self-experience  is  more  than  neededwhen building an assistive technology tool.We believe that our research, proving explicitproblems that dyslexics deal with, will move the11research in assistive technologies far more ahead.Existing applications are helpful but do not fulfillthe needs as much as they could.
We add valueto actual applications and make the gap betweensociety and people with special needs smaller.6 ConclusionThe outcome of the application is necessary toconfront with a sufficient group of dyslexics.
It isgenerally  stated  that  up  to  one  twentieth  ofpopulation  suffers  from  learning  andconcentration disabilities, although only some ofthem are diagnosed (Rello et al., 2013).
It wouldbe  unethical  to  stop  having  interests  inproblematic with dyslexia.Our future work will be directed the way ofdeveloping proposed tool, to make it usable in e-books, study materials, and within daily routineneeds.ReferencesClaire Battye and Meghan Rainsberry, 2013.
