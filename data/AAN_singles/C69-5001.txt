ABSTRACTMY paper will deal with the theoretical and practicalquestions of the co-textual analysis of texts.The theoretical frame is contained by the chapterstitled Introduction and Conclusion.
MY aim here is toshow that the automatization of the text analysis expectsthe accumulated experiences of the general linguisticsand the documentation-theory to be summed up in one co-herent theo~z.
The linguistics has to examine the problemsof documentational thesauri, abstracting, indexing fromits own aspect, and has to insert these means and methodsof the documentation in the system of the text-analysis.The practical questions, certain concrete phases ofthe co-textual analysis of texts are dealt with in thechapters 2 and 3.
In connection with certain steps we hopeour demonstrative examples to contain solutions that willnecesssril~ become simpler further on.
Our aim was, firstof all, the presentation of the complete process on aspecial type of text.
Not all the parts of this completeprocess can be automatized yet.
But the presentation willalways happen with respect to the automatization.The next step should be the getting up of an analysingsystem that is built on the thesauristic elaboration of arelatively not big material.
Then we have to solve suchspecial problems of certain phases of the analysis thatcould not even mention in this flow chart-like survey.Beside and after the theoretical analysis, only thiscan be the test of the usefulness of the system.?
+ ?- I -I@INTRODUCTIONi._I Before I should analyse the problems of thetechnical means and a method for the text analysis,I should like to touch a more general question.
I wish togive a short sketch of the connection between the methodto be presented and the problems of the modern theory ofgrammar and theory of documentation.To see the connections of the theory of grammarclearer, let us start from Figure I.Every message is an element of a net of connections/context/, ~etermined by time, geographical place, culturalenvironments etc.
The linguistic analysis can set the onlyaim of discovering the inner /co-textual/ linguisticstructure of the text with the demand of completeness./It can draw near to the contextual connections only toan extent that is made possible by the structure of thedictionary having used at the analysis./The co-textual analysis --and the immediate con-stituent and sentence analysis that are organic parts of~t- -  can be done on d i f fe rent  w~s.TheF igure  1 shows the components o f  Chomsk~'sgemerative theory.
Chomsky's generative process /@/ startsfrom the 'base component' /B/o The deep structure of thesentence /DS/  comes to ex is tence  from the sentence-bas isby f i l l i ng  i t  up with Iex ic~l  elements in  the ' lex icon '/ L / .
The sur face s t ructure  /S~ comes to ex is tence byusing different kinds of transformations in the 'trans-formational component' /T/.
/The situating of the lexiconand the transformational component in Figure I wishes todemonstrate that we may need turning to the lexicon even-2 -I. ContextualrelationsAD\[~o SERI~uat  I rela~ | , ~, !

'o'I I ~ I~ Pt, tFigure 1.-3 -during dispatching the transformations./ The properinterpretating components /IDs and IS~ provide thesurface and deep structure with phonetic and semanticinterpretations.
These interpretations, to a certainextent, relate to the extralinguis~ic realit~ already.The phonetic interpretation contains the basic elements,too, necessary to the real pronouncing of the sentence,beside the phonological interpretation of the surfacestructure /PHTR = ~honetic representation/.
/The elementsoriginating in the speaker's subjective interpretationeither settle on or colour this./ The semantic inter-pretation --beside the establishing of the semanticcharacter of the immediate constituents-- trends to thediscovering of logical connections independent fromlanguage, hidden behind the given verbal representation/LOSR = logical semantic representation versus LISR =linguistic semantic representation/.A part of the investigations included by thegenerative linguistic theory, like other examinations ofother kinds, raise the possibility of generating sentenceson another way, too.
I This generative process /G'/ startsfrom the universal logical construction /LOSR/.
/Theuniversal logical construction is a net of connectionscontaining ,notion-words,2./ We have to order a linguisticstructure / DS/ --reflecting the characteristics of the~v~n language-- to this construction, and make aconcrete sentence of it / SS/.The way of the sentence-analysis /A/ is of theopposite direction to both.
At the same time, oursketched analysis is built on the theoretical basis,which has developed during the investigation concerningthe problems of the generative processes /G and G'/summarize~ above.
But, as the text analysis goes beyond the- 4 -boundar ies  o f  the  sentence ,  we have to  w iden  the  sentence-centered theoretical basis, as well.
3I.~ When analysing the notion 'text-structure' we canmake a difference between the linguistic and thesound-textural components of the text.
Both can belinearly and hierarchically patterned.The 'linear patterning' is a net of the recurrencesof elements that interweave the whole text.
The'hierarchical patterning' means the way as the text as awhole is built up from the basic units of the structurethrough the levels of the composition units of differentcomplexity.
4Of course there are texts where the sound-texturalcomponent is the organizer of the structure, but as itis not mY intention to deal with this now, I shall ignoretheir problems at present.A great part of the essays dealing with text analysisconsiders making lists of the structural elements ofsimilar construction.
/It mostly remains among sentence-boundaries, so the use of a sentence-centered theory isenough./ These lists are undoubtedly essentialcharacteristics of a text, but they reflect only oneaspect of the text structure.
This is what I called'linear patterning'.The other --and, from a certain point of view moreimportant-- aspect is the 'hierarchic~l patterning' ofthe text.
Its analysis means much more problems.The problems are different, according to the typesof texts.
Even if we consider only the most homogeneoustexts --the sclent~fic didactic prose or the prose toldonly in the third person not containing indirect speech--- 5 --ieven then we meet the following basic problem: grsmnatical/syntactic, semantic/ connections can be discovered onlyamong sentences constructing the so-called 'paragraphs'./At the same time, no one has yet established the typesof it, neither has s~yone described its rules as a system./larger text-units ~han 'paragraphs' only suchconnect ions  can be shown that  are car r ied  by the' content  s t ruc ture ' .
Thus, bes ide  the examinat ion o f  thegrammat ica l  const ruct ion  o f  the 'paragraphs '  we a l so  haveto  l ook  fo r  the means to  he lp  us to  d i scover  the connect ionsof this kind._I.5 On this field we can get the greatest help from thedocumentation theory.
During the last ten years thedocumentalists wrought out means and methods that willprobably prove useful at the analysis of not scientifictexts as well.I should like to mention the thesaurus as the mostsignificant means.
The thesaurus --as known-- is a notion-dictionary serving for the normalization of the indexingand searching language, which provides the differentconnections among the notions.
It is this feature, thatI think makes this means very useful to the linguisticsfor its own purposes, too.From the methods those of the abstracting andautomatic indexing may become significant in our analysis.In the text analysis there is a 'great obstacle', that thetexts are too extensive.
For the sake of making theanalysis easier and the hierarchical structure clear-cutit is both useful and necessary to replace the largerstructure-units by their abstracts.
When speaking ofabstracting --though abstracts made by statistic methodsmay mean a good help temporarily-- I do not think of-6 -statistic abstracts alone.In a broad outline these aspects of the documentationtheory mean the wider frame, in which certain questionsof the following analysing method can be examined.2.ON THE MEANS OF THE CO-TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF TEXTSIn my opinion, the following means are necessaryfor the co-textual analysis of texts:I. a thesaurus including different sectors;2. a rule-system working on sentences:a/phonological, morphonological rules, ~b/ syntactic rules,c/ semantic rulesto the linguistic semantic interpretationto the logical semantic interpretation;3. a system of the syntactic-semantic rules of thebasic composition units;4. a rule-system of an abstracting process;5. a rule-system of a process that is able toestablish the thematic connections of a 'text'consisting of abstracts.In this chapter I want to deal only with thequestions of the structure of the thesaurus in details.The work of all the rule-systems is based on the below-sketched thesaurus structure.2.1 The thesaurusThe base of the linguistic analysis has to be athesaurus that unites the structures of the thesaurusmade for the purpose of documentation and that of thelexiconhavingdeveloped during the general linguistic- 7 -linvestigations.Such a thesaurus consists of two main parts: thesector of definitions and that of classifications.2.1.1 On the sector of definitionsThe headwords of the documentational thesaurus --combining the structural characteristics of the moreimportant thesauri 5 -  contains the following constituents:headword /descriptor/SY synonymsEQ equivalent termsTR translationDEF definitionS~ scope noteSF semantic factors areISF is semantic factor ofFIELD field, thematic groupCAT category /material, feature, process/BT broader termsBT-LOG broader terms - logicalBT-WH broader terms - wholeBT-CON broader terms - connected/terms to which the headword is connectedbut not as a logical broader term or awhole/nar rower  te rms NTNT-LOGNT-PTNT-CONCOL collateral termsCOL-LOGCOL-PTCOL-CONASC associated termsASCR associated reflexiveASCT associated to iASCF associated fromEC empirically connectedLet us demonstrate these constituents by thethesaurus-entry of two concrete words:-8  -/bird/DEFSTISFFIELDBT-LOG-WHNT-LOG-PT-CONCOL-LOGECASCRASCTASCFtenger /sea/DEFSTISFFIELDBT-LOG-WHNT-LOG-PT-CONCOL-LOG-PTASCRASCTASCF/We shall deal with- -  separately later./'poultry''migratory bird',...'animals'' vert ebrat e ''living being'' singing-birds', ' birds-of-prey''beak'.

suffix IV/__ surf....... OTH ......I have dealt with the construction of the lexicalentries and grammatical morphemes in the thesaurus above.I should like to add the following to what I told so far.I.
By dividing the entry of the thesaurus into alexical definition /LDEF/ and a thessuristic informationblock /a thesauristic definition: TDEF/, the verbally- I I -imanifestating knowledge can be separated from the so-called encyclopedic knowledge.2.
The syntactic informations of the lexicaldefinitions naturally contain only the informationsrelevant in the given language.3.
The semantic informations are demonstrated hereonly with a lexical definition.
Of course this is not theform that I find suitable but the definitions written ina semantic meta-language.4.
The thesauristic informations are the results ofa multihierarchical classification.
For expressing themwe have to elaborate the own 'notional language' of thethe saurus.5.
The information FIF/J9 points to the groups andfields into which the notion represented b x the givenword is classified.
The group and field structure has tounit the virtues of the thematic classifications of thelinguistic thesauri /Roget, Dornseiff/, the documentationthesauri and the illustrated dictionaries.
But itsre~lisation can be built only on a classification-theoretical basis.6.
For reaching a satisfactory or suitable degreeof the division of the informations BT NT and COL we haveto analyse it further.7.
When defining the informations ASC we --ofcourse-- think only of the minimal informations that canbe defined with a relatively big probability.
We wanted tomark the indefiniteness of the definition by selectingit from the others with a dotted line.- 12  -2.1.2 On the sector of classificationsThe sector of classifications first of all has tocontain an alphabetic index that includes all the rootsof words and grammatical morphemes, with reference to theform by whicn they can be found in the sector ofdefinitions,/Beside the basic alphabetic index we may constructan a-tergo list and a morphematic ~ IC  list as well.
Thislatter one reflects the connections SF and ISF./Different special classifications can be made onthe basis of the lexical and the thessuristic informations.Lexical classifications:The classes of lexical units havingthe same s~ntactic categories~semantic markers,conditions~syntactic semantic ~B~2~B~,o e o e o oThe classes ofderivative endings,suffixes,...... of the same character.Thesauristic classifications:fields of the elements having thesame FIELD markerDifferent8n~/orhierarchicalassociat&ve nets.We can provide the classifications with- 13  -lidentificators, and we can order the identificators tothe thesaurus entries.Thus the atr~cture of a thesaurus-uni~ is as follows:L-~EF /lexical definition /T-X~F /the sauristic definition/I~ENT /identificators/2.2 As I have already mentioned, I do not wish to dealhere with the other means of the co-textual textanalysis.
We can feel the character of their structureat the presentation of the way of analysing.
Their realelaboration can be realized only on the basis of aprofound analysis of the mutual influences of all themesns ,9@ON THE METHOD OF THE CO-TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF TEXTS3.0 The algorithm of the analysisThe process of the co-textual analysis of textsconsists of the following larger units:I. the segmentation of the texts,2.
the discovery of the grammatical structure ofthe individual sentences,3.
compiling of special text-thesauri,4.
the discovery of the net of connections of the Icommunication units, the establishment of thebasic composition units,5.
making the abstracts of the basic compositionunits,- 14  -6. the thematic analysis of the text consistingof abstracts --in more steps.3.1 The segmentation of the textThe notion of 'text' is interpreted on the basisof extra-linguistic criteria.
The text is always given tous.
The 'whole' is obvious owing to typogrsphical reasonsor~main ly  in case of spoken texts-- the beginning andthe end are determined another way.For illustrating the method of analysis we havechosen a written, 'simple narrative text', one thatcontains only communications in the third person and maybedirect speech in the first person beside.
The boundariesof the segments of the primary classification --as we have8 written text-- are marked by the author's punctuation-marks+The text chosen to%he ~emonstration and its informativEnglish equivalent are as follows.

I have dealt with its problems indetail st another place.
Here I should like to mentiononly the things that are necessary for the furtherinvestigation of the analysing process.~._~._I First of all we make the index of the word-forms ofthe whole text.

~-  : ~P142145./We cannot find predictions in this text.We presented some of the special text-thesauriin ~.3./~.~.5 As the compositional analysis starts with theanalysis of communication units we build thedefinitions of the higher units on the notion 'communicationunit' instead of the indefinited notion 'paragraph'.But we need some 'transitional notions', too:What we call s continous communicational chain /CC/is the succession of communication units with predicates offirst person in direct speech.
/In this ~ext we can see itin the communication units 12.2 - 15.2./What we call a simple block Of communication units/SB/ is the --mostly continuous-- chain of the communicationunits all of which contains on_._~e explicite or implicitereference element pointing to the same 'reference'.
Thisreference element has to be replaced ~ the 'referredelement', if we want to give the semantic interpretationof the communication unit.-~0-1~atwe call a complexblock of Commun, icationunits/CB/ .is a --mastly continuous-- chain of communicationunits connected by more 'referred elements~.#For example the communication units 16.1 - 21.2form a SB, the communication units 8.1 - l0 form a CB./We mean the basic units of the compositionalstructure the following way:We shall call basic composition unit /or comp@aitionunit of the first de~ree/ the structure unit that formsone thematic unit and that comes to existence immediatelyfrom the communication units.
/This always has to consistof morethan one communication unit.
The 'orphancommunication unit' inserted between the composition unitsforms a compositio n unit of the zero de,Tee./Generally: we shall call composition unit of the ndegree the structure unit that also forms one thematicunit and that contains compositionunit of the /n-l/degree as well.5.~.~ Both the simplex and the complex blocks of thecommunication units and the continuous communicationchains sign some kind of the compositional dissectionalready.
But the discovery of the compositional structuredemands a detailed thematic analysis.At the thematic analysis the first fixed point ismeant by the 'referential elements'.When the referential elements hold not manycommunication units together, this mostly means s smallestthematic unit, too.Inside the longer simple blocks and in the parts ofthe text outside the simple and complex blocks thediscovery of the thesauristic connections among the lexical- 31  -units may help us to separate the composition units.The projection of the continuous communication chainon the text can mean a help of another kind./The thessuristic connections separate for examplethe communication units 37-39 /~insulgrworld' ~ 'fromisland to island' -- 'islands'/ as one independentcomposition unit.The communication chain helps at the compositionalsegmentation of the text consisting of the communicationunits II.I-15~2 /The simple block 13.1-14 is separated bythe referential element 'Finnish coast', the 12.1-12.2 isseparated from 11.1-11.2 by the Person i./After all we can separate the follov~ng compositionunits of the zero and first degree:the serial number of the referential the character ofthe comp.

u.3.~ The process of makin~ the abstracts of the basiccomposition unitsThe making of the abstracts of the composition unitsestablished in 3.4 happens in more steps._5._5.1 We take the composition units one by one andreduce their deep structures.This means that the constituents containing the mostfrequent words and the ones expressing time are left,theother constituents of completive character /that is AdvPembedded in NP/S or NP/VP/S/ are omitted./Na~urally, the 'deep structure' means only theincomplete deep st~ctures containing the really existingconstltuents of the original communication units here too.fThen we write out the surface representations oneby one according to the formerly reduced deep structures.As the result of this step we shall get thefollowing ,reduced text'.
/Here we illustrate this processonly with the composition units I-ii./i.
There are people standing on the bridge of the Danube.They are looking at the gulls.2.
I often see these birds at our reach of the Danubeas well.Sometimes they dart up high.3.
But I have seen gulls above the sea, too.4.
Then the weather had already turned to winter-like.The birches of the island shone yellow.The North Sea dashed against its granite coasts withanger.- 33  -5.
My ship had started from a Finnish harbour and wasleaving for Stockholm.6.
Wherever we passed, there were often appearing somegranite islands.There were pines and birches on it.7.
There were lonely lighthouses towering on some of them.8.
The wind was wuthering on the deck.The waves threateningly dashed against the side ofthe ship.9.
I stayed out on the deck for a time.I0.
I sent farewell to the Finnish coasts.I had such a homely feeling there.Ii.
I have never seen Italy.I have always been drawn to the North by m~ desire.~.5 .2  Before beginning the second step of making theabstract we have to examine the orphan blocksconsisting of more communication units.
We have to decideif they represent one or more composition units.This is relatively easy in cases like that of thecomposition unit 8.
Its two communication units areconnected in their content by the explicite thesauristicconnection between the 'deck' and the 'side of the ship'/both are the parts of the 'ship'/.
/We can find animplicite connection as well: "the wind was wuthering","the waves threateningly dashed", the question is to whatextent can this be made expllcite./The communication units of the composition unit IIare connected in their form by the pair of adverbsnever - a lw~.The composition unit 4 raises mo?e problems already.We can establish from the 'birches of the island' u onthe basis of the later occurences of the 'island' andthe 'birches' /see the composition unit 6/-- that itrefers to the birches of sea islands.
The 'granite island'- ~4 -'granite coast' connection also links the two lastcommunication units, The 'turned to winter-like' standsonly in a slack associative connection with the predicate'dashed ... with anger', but it is not in any explicitelydemonstrable connection with the predicate ' shone yellow'.Thus we could regard the second and third communicationunits as an independent composition unit.3.~.3 In the next step we substitute the separatecomposition units by one communication unit.
Thismeans the choice of one communication unit /preservingits original form/, or we have to generate a new one --originally not occuring in this form.To be able to carry out these tasks we must havethe co~lete analysis of the sentences of the reducedtext.The choice can happen on structural and/orstatistical basis.We choose for example the first communication unitfrom the reduced text of the composition unit 16 onstructural basis because the others are such attributesof the NP of this communication unit that can be regardedthe paraphrases of the attributes occuring inside thecommunication units /'plaintive' -- 'painfully crying' --' sad'/.We choose for example the second communicationunit from the reduced text of the composition unit IIon statistical basis because this is connected by'North'to the other communication units, while the first one isnot connected by 'Italy'.We choose the last communication unit from thereduced text of the composition unit 18 on structuraland  statistical basis.
Structurally because this is an- 35  -ianswer to the first two asking communication units, andstatistically because the last-but-one communication unitcontains NP-s that occur only once in the whole text/'swallow', 'yellow-bird', .../.we generate /that means a generating o f~ Whentype --see Figure I/ both the structural and thestatistical aspect plays an important part.
Actually itis enough to speak of generating only because the choicecan be considered as a kind of generating by which wemake a communication unit identical with one of ~heoriginal communication units.Let us demonstrate the character of generating bymaking the abstract of the composition unit IQ.The logical deep structures of the communicationunits of this composition unit are as follows:/I/ P: says farewell tos.lv: I 's~: coasts121/3/ P: is s~: iI i sg: coasts :Finnishwhere:coastsP.-f~eels oneselfsomehow:homelyConsidering the paraphrase-possibilities of the /i/and /2/ and the tenses occuring in the text we cangenerate the following sentence from these:'I said farewell to the hp~ely Finnish coasts.
'or, holding to the structure of the text:'I sent farewell toward9 the hom~ly Finnlah coasts.
'I'When we generate, of course it is not necessary tocondense all the informations --hidden in the logicalrepresentation-- into one sentence.- 36  -After the generating or the choice of the sentenceswe get the following 'abstract-text':20.21.22 .I.
People on the bridge of the Danube are looking at thegulls.2.
I often see these birds at our reach of the Danube aswell.3.
But I have seen gulls above the sea, too.4.
Then the weather had already turned to winter-like.5.
MY ship passed from a Finnish harbour towards Stockholm.6.
Wherever we passed, there were often appearing somegranite islands.7.
There were lonely lighthouses towering on some of them.8.
The wind was wuthering on the deck.9.
I stayed out on the deck for a time.I0.
I sent farewell to the homely Finnish coasts.ii.
I have always been drawn to the North by ~f desire.12.
Gulls joined the track of the ship.13.
If they had not accompanied me, that severe and s tor~sea murnfulness would have been unbearably depressh~..14.
How good it is, that they are crying: "Our country Isthe sea."15.
Only theirs?16.
Suddenly a plaintive bird-voice stroke my esrs.17.
The group of the cryin~ birdies was fl\[ing over the ship,18.
Maybe these are not migratory just movlng birds.19.
Do they dare to shulder the journey above the angrilywaving sea because the islands are not very far fromeach other?The sailors throw out scrapings to the gulls.But who feeds these tiny birds of the sea?This recklessness that shoulders the journey above thesea is encouraging for one who has sorrow inside likeme because I am carrying a dear deceased in m~self,~ sometimes something cries in me just as those tinydear birds cried above my head.The informations condensed into the abstract of theliterary text are relevant with different character thanthose of the scientific %ext.
In this abst rac t~composition unit has to be represented by acommunicationunit.- 57  -r3.6 The,,thematic anal~sis of the 'abstract-text'Among the communicati~ units of the 'abstract-text' we can establish very few connections with thecharacter of those in the primary text.
Here it is ratherthe thesauristic connections that come forward.
Theanalysis is similar to the one told earlier.
Its resultcan be summarized as follows.The different thessuristic connections dissectthe text of the abstract the following w~v:i - 2 'the Danube'3 - 22 'the sea'/In all the composition units except I, 2, 4, 15,16, 18 we can find 'the sea' itself or some element beingin some thesauristic connection with it./The 1-2 forms a composition unit of the seconddegree, its other connecting element is the 'gulls'.We can dxssolve further the unit kept together bythe 'sea'.
The inner '~hematic connecting elements, ofthe so-gained composition units of the second degree areas follows:5 - 7 'passed' + 'islands'9 - ii Person I12 - 14 'gulls' + 'ship'16 - 19 'birdies'20 - 21 'feeding'This compositional division will obviously meetthe net of connections of the communication units of theprimary text.
The orphan composition units /3, 4p 8, 15,22/ include the orphan communication units.The composition units of the second degree of theunit linked by the 'sea' form two composition units of theth i rd  clegree:/5 -7 /+ /9-11/ : Person I ~my ship,, 'I remained','I sent,, '~  desire'//This includes the composition unit 8as well.//12-14/ + /16-19/: 'bird' /either as a primary lexicalunit or as a semantic and-or thesauristic element//This includes the composition unit 15as well./The compositional structure of the whole text can besummarized the following way:Birds above the sea0 I 2 3I.

This recklessness that shoulders thejourney above the sea is encouraging 22In the hierarchical structure we cannot establishlevels equally valid to every text, but we can define the'depth-level' of every composition unit as thecompositional distance measured from the ,whole of thework of art' as the broadest composition unit.
/The upper- 59  -rline of numbers marks the depth-levels./ We can observethat we can meet eg.
a composition unit of the firstdegree on the most different depth-levels..CONCLUSIONSMy paper dealt with the questions of the co-textual analysis of a special text-type.
I tried todeliberate on the complete text-analysingprocessalgorithmically.
This process has parts than can be doneautomatically already now, and theoretically -- Isuppose-- all its parts can be automatized.
But thepractical realisation expects the solution of differentproblems that are among the key-problems of thelinguistics and the documentation.
MY intention was firstof all to show how these are connected even at theanalysis of the simplest text.
Finally I should like topoint to some problems of basic importance again.~.l Before the compilement of the thesaurus we haveto select the so-called 'notion-words'.
Mostlythese ~notion-words' take place in the sector of thethesaur~stic definitions.We also have to elaborate the 'semantic basiclanguage' by which the words of the given language canbe semantically defined and we have to define the systemof the relations to be used in the semantic definitions./The 'notion-words' are words, the elements of the'semantic basic language' are of feature character./The thesaurus has to provide the interrelationsamong the different 'notion-words' and the different'lexical units'.
These interrelations are of one-many- 40  -character:TOEF.LDEFinThat is: more lexical units /LDEF/ m~y belong toone 'notion word' /TDEF/._~.2 The relation 'logical semantic representation' --'linguistic semantic representation' is an analogousequivalent of the relation 'notion word'--'lexical unit'.The 'logical semantic representation' /LOSE/represents'logical connections' among ' notion words',while the 'linguistic semantic representation' /LISR/represents 'verbal connections' among 'lexlcal units'./In fact~ LISR is a deep structure that demonstrates thesemantic character of the constituents, too./In connection with these we have to define thesystems of both the logical and linguistic connections,the way of their representation, the correspondence ofthese two systems of connections, and the way of passingover from one to the other.The interrelations are here interrelations of setsand they are also of one-many character.
/That is: to sgiven set of elementary logical relations more differenttext-structures can belong.
These text structures one Dyone may contain only as many independent deep structuresas ~he number of the elementary logical relations./The efficacity of the analysing system first of alldepends on the determinedness of the elements and relationsof the logical and linguistic system and of the rules of- 41  -rthe matching between the two systems.~.~ We have to mention that the relation of thephonetic and phonological representation is alsoanalogous to the above told one, though this analogycontains an oblique symmetry.
This is a naturalconsequence of the continuous and one-way one-many relationpassing from the logical representation to the phoneticonee_~._~ From the point of view of the relation of thelinguistic deep and surface structure the structureof the syntactic informations and the conditioninformations of the LDEF is of p r imly  importance.
It issignificant to approach it from the transformations./That is, we have to ~ examine to what extent the concretelexical units occuring in a given deep structure determinethe character of the transformations to be used./~._5 It is only a solution of the above sketchedproblems happening on 8 theoretical basis formingone coherent system that makes possible the solution ofsuch questions as- the automatic realization of the transitionsfrom the surface structure to the incompletedeep structure,from the incomplete to the complete deepstructure,from the deep structure ~D the logicalrepre sentat ion~- the automatic discovery of the thematic connectionsbuilt on the TDEF-s,- the automatic establishment of ~he --in the g ivenconnection-- irrelevant elements of thedeep structure,- the automatic realization of the reductionbuilding on the irrelevant elements,- 42  -flna~Av- the automatic dispatching of the generating ofG' character necessary during the process.~.~ The demonstrating material inthe chapters 2 and 3of m~ paper was a so-called 'simple narrative text'.When listing the problems we must not ignore the factthat the different kinds of texts will enlarge the aboveenumerated list of the basic problems with their specialproblems as well.- 4~ -fNotesI.
