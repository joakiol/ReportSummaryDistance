FINDING CLAUSES IN UNRESTRICTED TEXT BY FINITARY AND STOCHASTIC METHODSEva I. EjerhedAT&T Bell Laboratories & University of UmeaDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of UmeaS-90187 Umea, SwedenABSTRACTThe paper presents and compares two differentmethods of parsing, a regular expression methodand a stochastic method, with respect o theirsuccess in identifying basic clauses inunrestricted English text.
These methods ofparsing were developed in order to be applied tothe task of improving the detection of largeprosodic units in the Bell Labs text-to-speechsystem, and were so applied experimentally.The paper also discusses the notion of basicclause that was defined as the parsing target.The result of a comparison of the error rates ofthe two parsing methods in the recognition ofbasic clauses showed that there was a 13% errorrate for the regular expression method and a6.5% error rate for the stochastic method.1.
IntroductionThe present paper describes the procedure thatwas followed in an extended experiment oreliably find basic surface clauses in unrestrictedEnglish text, using various combinations offinitary and stochastic methods.
The purpose wasto make some improvements in the detection andtreatment of large prosodic units above the levelof fgroups in the Bell Labs text-to-speechsystem.
This system currently relies exclusivelyon punctuation (commas and periods) for thedetection of such units, i.e.
tonal minor andmajor phrases.
Commas are correlated withtonal minor phrases, and sentence final periodswith tonal major phrases.
The notion of fgroup(one or more function words followed by one ormore content words), and its implementation ithe Bell Labs text-to-speech system is describedin Liberman & Buchsbaum (1985).Correct automatic detection of major syntacticboundaries, in particular clause boundaries, is aprerequisite for automatic insertion of finallengthening, boundary tones and pauses at suchboundaries within sentences (cf.
Allen, Hunnicutt& Klatt 1987,and Altenberg 1987).
Theseprosodic phenomena make significantcontribution to the naturalness and intelligibilityof synthetic speech.
Unfortunately, the task ofparsing unrestricted text correctly, in order tofind the relevant sentence internal syntacticboundaries has turned out to be very difficult.This paper is a report of an attempt to provide abetter foundation for parsing text by the use ofsimple fmitary and stochastic computationalmethods.
These simple methods have notfigured prominently in the theory and practice ofnatural langauge parsing, with some exceptions(Langendoen 1975, Church 1982, Ejerhed &Church 1983).
For an experimental, and morecomplicated method to derive all prosodic unitsin the text-to-speech system, i.e.
not just tonalminor and major phrases but every type ofprosodic unit, from the syntactic structure andlength of constituents, ee Wright, Bachenko &Fitzpatrick (1986).The first purpose of the experiment was to testthe performance of a finite state parser, when theparser was given the rather difficult andsubstantive tasks of finding basic, non-recursiveclauses in continuous text, in which each wordhad been tagged with a part of speech label.Parts of the tagged Brown corpus were used,representing the genres of both informative andimaginative prose.
The clause grammar,consisting of a regular expression for clauses ofdifferent kinds, was constructed by the author .-.and tt was first applied to text that wasguaranteed to have correct parts of speechassigned to the words, so that problems inconstructing the grammar could be isolated fromproblems in assigning correct parts of speech.The finite state parser that used the clausegrammar consisted of a program that matchedregular expressions for clauses against thelongest substrings of tagged words that fit them,and it was constructed and implemented by K.Church.The second purpose was to see whether basicclauses could also be recognized by stochasticprograms, after these had been trained onsuitable training material.
The training materialwas prepared by hand-correcting the output ofthe program that processed the regular210expressions for clauses.
A stochastic program forassigning unique part of speech tags to words inunrestricted text had been created by K. Church,and trained on the tagged Brown corpus (seeChurch 1987).
The resultant program is 95-99%correct in its performance, depending on thecriteria of correctness used, and it can be used asa lexical front end to any kind of parser, i.e.
notnecessarily stochastic or finite state parsers.However, the question presented itself whetherthe stochastic procedure that was so successful inrecognizing parts of speech could also be appliedto more advanced tasks such as recognizing nounphrases and clauses.
The present paperconcentrates on the parsing of basic clauses.
Theparsing of noun phrases by the same twomethods is compared in Ejerhed (1987), and thestochastic parsing of noun phrases is described indetail in Church (1987).The structure of the paper is as follows.
Section2 defines the target of a basic clause, and reportson the outcome of the search for such milts bythe two methods.
Section 3 discusses thecorrelations between clause units as defined bythis paper, and the prosodic units of tonal minorand major phrases in the Bell Labs text-to-speech system.2.
Finding Clauses2.1 Why Clauses?Syntactic surface clauses are interesting units oflanguage processing for a variety of reasons.
Inthe surface clause, criteria of form and meaningconverge to guarantee both that it can berecognized solely by surface syntactic propertiesand that it constitutes a meaningful unit (ideallya proposition) in a semantic representation.Clauses have been investigated inpsycholinguistic research.
Jarvella (1971) foundeffects of both sentence boundaries and clauseboundaries in recall of spoken complex sentencesand took them, along with previous results ofJarvella & Pisoni (1970), to support a clause-by-clause view of within-sentence processing.Later research on reading comprehension hasfound effects on gaze duration not only of wordlength and word frequency, but also of syntacticlocal ambiguity (garden paths) and of ends ofsentences (Just & Carpenter 1984).
However,the study of clause units as distinct fromsentence units has not been carried outsystematically in psycholinguistic experiments sofar, and a lot of basic facts remain to be foundout about the role of clause units of differentkinds in the processes whereby spoken andwritten language is comprehended.2.2 The Definition of A Basic ClauseFinding basic noun phrases is important as astepping stone to finding clauses, on theassumption that an important subset of themhave an initial sequence consisting of a nounphrase followed by a tensed verb as a definingcharacteristic.
The result of scoring therespective success of the two methods of parsingbasic noun phrases in sample text portions,reported in Ejerbed (1987), was the following.The regular expression output had 6 errors in185 noun phrases, i.e.
a 3.3% error rate.
Thestochastic output had 3 errors in 218 nounphrases, i.e.
a 1.4% error rate.
Both results mustbe considered good in the absolute sense of anautomatic analysis of unrestricted text, but thestochastic method has a clear advantage over theregular expression method.
Basic noun phrasescan be found, which is of important for clauserecognition.The definition of basic clause that was used inthis study has the following characteristics: a) itconcentrates on certain defining characteristicspresent at the beginnings of clauses; b) it followsfrom a particular hypothesis about syntacticworking memory: that it is limited to processingone clause at the time; and c) it assumes that therecognition of any beginning of a clauseautomatically eads to the syntactic losure of theprevious clause.It should be clear from the above, that thetheoretical reasons for pursuing a recursion-freedefinition of a basic clause have to do with atheory of linguistic performance, rather than witha theory of linguistic competence, in whichmemory limitations play no part.
It is ahypothesis of the author's current clause-by-clause processing theory, that a unitcorresponding to the basic clause is a stable andeasily recognizable surface unit, and that it isalso an important partial result and buildingblock in the construction of a richer linguisticrepresentation that encompasses syntax as wellas semantics and discourse structure.2.3 A Regular 17rpression for Basic ClausesSeveral versions of a regular expression for basicclauses were written by the author and precededthe one presented in Appendix 1, which was,99N 220applied to 60 files of Brown corpus tagged textof 2000 words each, newspaper texts A01-A20,scientific texts J01-J20 and fiction texts K01-K20.The first half of the definition of *clause*introduces a few auxiliary definitions: comp for aset of complementizers, punct for a set ofpunctuation marks, and tense for a set of verbforms that are either certainly tensed ("BED""BEDZ .... BEM .... BER .... BEZ .... DOD .... DOZ""HVD .
.
.
.
HVZ .
.
.
.
MD .
.
.
.
V'BD .
.
.
.
VBZ") orpossibly tensed ("BE .... DO .... HV .... VB").
Thedefinition of clause also uses the previouslydefined *brown-np-regex*.
The second andlarger part of the definition of *clause* consistsof a union of six concatenations.The first defines complete main clauses asconsisting of a sequence of an optionalcoordinating conjunction CC followed by anobligatory basic noun phrase followed byoptional non-clausal complements and anoptional adverb followed by an obligatory tensedverb followed by anything expcept thepunctuations or complementizers indicated in thelist after (not .... followed by optionalpunctuation.The second defines clauses introduced by anobligatory CC followed by an optional adverbfollowed by an obligatory element which iseither a tensed or participial verb form, followedby the same clause ending as in the firstdefinition.The third concatenation defines a subordinateclause as starting with an optional coordinatingconjunction followed by an obligatorycomplementizer followed by the same clauseending as in the first and second definitions.The remaining three definitions are of clausefragments rather than full clauses.
Consider thefollowing sentence: The man \[who liked icecream,\] ate too much.In it, the relative clause makes a basic clauseunit that breaks up the main clause into twoclause fragments.
The third concatenationdefines noun phrase fragments that begin with abasic noun phrase followed optionally by one ormore prepositional phrases, or sequences of CCnp or $ np, followed by the same clause endingas in the other definitions.
In the example above,\[the man\] would be a noun phrase fragment.221The fifth concatenation defines verb phrasefragments, e.g.
\[ate too much\].The sixth concatenation defines clause fragmentsthat are adjuncts, i.e.
adverbial phrases,prepositional phrases and adjective phrases.
Thetypical case in which such a fragment isrecognized is when it precedes another clause:\[On a clear day,\] \[you can see forever\].2.4 Output of Regular Expression for ClausesThe regular expression in Appendix 1 wasautomatically expanded into a deterministic fsafor clause recognition by Church's program.
Thisrule compilation will not be described here.
Anexcerpt from the result of applying it to the 60files mentioned in the introduction to this sectionis presented in Appendix 2, where the locationand nature of hand-corrections have been high-lighted.
The hand-correction was guided by thefollowing principles.1) There should be at most one tensed verb perclause.
This inserts a clause boundary after atensed clause and before a tensed verb in thefollowing kind of case, which the current regularexpression marcher does not capture: \[Theannouncement\] \[that the President was late\]\[was made late in the afternoon\].2) There should be a clause boundary after asentence initial prepositional or adverbial phraseand before the sequence np tensed verb, whetheror not they are separated by a comma:\[At thesummit in Iceland\] \[Gorbachev insisted ...\].3) There should be a clause boundary before CCfollowed by a tensed verb.
Although the secondconcatenation in the clause regex aimes atcapturing such clauses, it is not alwayssuccessful in doing so because there is no way,given the current implementation of negation inthe regular expression program, to state that aclause should end before a concatenation ofitems, i.e.
before (* CC tense).
Only singleitems can be negated at present.
Example: /ThePurchasing Departments are well operated\] [andfollow generally accepted practices\].4) There should be a clause boundary before apreposition (IN) followed by a wh-word, i.e.before (* IN (+ WDT WPO WP$ WRB WQL)).For the same reason given under 3), there is noway currendy to state that a clause should endbefore such a sequence.
Example: \[The CityExecutive Committee deserves praise for themanner\] [in which the election was conductedl.Several interesting observation were made in thecourse of doing these hand-corrections.
For one,there were errors in the Brown corpusassignment of tags, in particular several errorsconfusing VBD and VBN, and there were errorswhere the sequence TO VB was tagged IN NN.More seriously, it turned out that the words asand like, which have the property of functioningeither like prepostions IN or subordinatingconjunctions CS were always tagged CS, thusleading to incorrect recognition of clauses inmany cases.
Another problem for recognizingclauses on the basis of identifying tensed verbswas that the tag VB is applied to forms that areeither infinitival or present tensed (orsubjunctive), depending on context.
It wouldhave been better if such forms had beenconsidered lexically ambiguous and givendistinct ags.
However, by and large the taggedBrown corpus is a very good and useful product,both in the choice of tags, and in the consistencywith which they have been applied.
Doing thehand-correction also forced the realization thatthe clause recognition program, like the nounphrase recognition program, dependes cruciallyon accurate assignment of parts of speech to allwords, on order to work well.
For this task,Church's stochastic parts program is admirablysuited, since it gives correct assignments in avery large number of cases, and it holds thepotential of further improvement in itsperformance with further training.2.5 Stochastic Recognition of ClausesAs stated before, the regex *clause* was appliedto sixty texts in the Brown corpus, and theoutput was hand-corrected.
The hand-correctedfiles, containing an estimated total of at least20,000 basic clauses, including clause fragments,were then used as training material for astochastic recognition program.
The trainingconsisted of observing the location of clauseopens and clause closes, and a special trainingspecifically in locating tensed verbs.
Aftertraining, the stochastic parts program andthereafter the stochastic lause recognizer wasapplied by K. Church to a large amount ofAssociated Press newswire text from May 26,1987 (526 blocks, 2381353(8) bytes).
Anexcerpt of the result is presented in Appendix 3.The result, again, is strikingly good.A comparison of the nature and amount of errorsin recognizing basic clauses in a sample ofuncorrected regex output, and a sample of output222from the stochastic lause program, can be madeon the basis of Tables I and 2 at the end.It appears that the stochastic program is moresuccessful than the current regular expressionmethod.
However, certain improvements in theregex program could change that.
What isneeded is the facility to process generalizedregular expressions, which admit the operationsof complement and intersection, in addition tothe operations of concatenation, union andKleene star that characterize r gular expressions.In any case there axe some interesting differencesin the kinds of errors made by the currant regexprogram and the stochastic one for recognizingclauses.
The regex program systematically errsby underrecognizing, never by overrecognizing,and in the selected portions that were scored, itonly puts a few clause boundaries in the wrongplace.
It misses lots of clause boundaries, butthe ones it gets are mostly correct.The stochastic program, on the other hand, isable to get many clause boundaries correctly thatelude the regular expression matcher, e.g.clauses not introduced by complementizers.
Thestochastic program errs both by overrecognizingand underrecognizing clauses, and sometimes italso places the clause open or clause close in thewrong place.
Some cases of incorrect clauserecognition are due to incorrect assignments ofparts of speech to words.
However, the totalnumber of errors with the stochastic method (21)is smaller than the total number of errors withthe regex method (40), for approximately thesame number of clauses to be recognized, 304versus 308.
This is a very surprising outcomeindeed, and if taken literally, without any furtherweighting of the different types of errors, itmeans that the error rate for the stochasticmethod for recognizing clauses is 6.5%, ascompared with 13% for the regex method.3.
On the Relation between Clauses andInto.
";on UnitsFinding baslt, tause units in arbitrary text isnecessary in order to locate tonal minor phrases,which, in addition to a phrase accent, also have aboundary tone, and, particularly at slow rates ofspeech, a pause at the end of the phrase.
Thecurrent experiment in text analysis has beenconcerned primarily with informative rather thanimaginative prose, and envisages appLications ofthe text-to-speech system to the reading ofinformative prose like newspaper text.In the current Bell Labs text-to-speech system,tonal minor phrase boundaries are identified onthe basis of commas, and tonal major phraseboundaries ate identified on the basis of periods.Finding more tonal minor phrase boundaries byusing syntactic structure, in addition topunctuation, is the problem we are trying toaddress with the methods described in this paper.In order to know where tonal minor phraseboundaries actually occur in the reading ofinformative texts, which typically have very longsentences (an average of 21 words comparedwith 14 words in general fiction based on Browncorpus data), it would be necessary to makerecordings of several persons reading bothauthentic and prepared texts in a rhetoricallyexplicit way, to borrow a phrase from Beckman& Pierrehumbert (1986), and then make extensivespeech analyses of them, particularly offundamental frequency movements and pauses.In the absence of such data for AmericanEnglish, the following kinds of boundariesbetween clauses and clause fragments werehypothesized to constitute intonation breaks withthe status of tonal minor phrase boundaries.
Theyale marked with # in the examples below.a) After sentence initial adverbials and before nptense: \[At the summit in Iceland\] # \[Gorbachevinsisted...\]b) After a relative clause and before a tensedverb: \[A House Committee\] [which heard hislocal option proposal\] # \[is expected\] \[to give ita favorable report.\]c) After other noun phrases with clausalcomplements and before a tensed verb: \[Theannouncement\] \[that the President was late\] #\[was made by the Press Secretary to the waitingjournalists.ld) Before a set of complementizers categorizedCS in the Brown corpus, it is frequently the casethat there is an intonation break: \[that/CS ...\],\[whether/CS ...\], \[iflCS ...\], \[since/CS ...\],\[because/CS ...1, \[as/CS ...1.However, there are some exceptions to this , inparticular:(i) Comparatives: \[This is not as/QL fast/J \]\[as/CS I would like ... \] or \[The theorem ismore/RBR general~J J\] \[thanlCS what we havedescribed\](ii) The words as/CS and like/CS when used asprepositions, i.e.
followed by noun phrases that223are not subjects of clauses: \[Jenkins left theWhite House in 1984,\] \[and joined Wedtech\]\[as/CS its director of marketing two years later.\]For testing purposes, short passages of sevenconsecutive sentences each from the Brown files,and four sentences each from the AP newswirestories were synthesized by the author, using theBell Labs text-to-speech system.
Thoseboundaries between clauses and clause fragmentsthat are identified above were implemented inthe same way that commas are, i.e.
with a phraseaccent belonging to the tonal minor phrase, finallengthening, a boundary tone, and a short pauseof 200 ms.
The results have not yet beensubjected to perceptual tests.There are some studies of the relation betweenclause units and intonation units that providerelevant data for future work.
Garding (1967)studied prosodic features in spontaneous andread Swedish speech.
She found that in thespontaneous speech, pauses were equally dividedbetween syntactic pauses and hesitation pauses, asyntactic pause being defined as one thatcoincides with a syntactic boundary.
In the readspeech, all pauses were syntactic pauses: "Theyappear between main clause and subordinateclause, before adverbial modifiers and betweenthe different parts of an enumeration.
The pauselength is shortest in enumerations and beforerelative clauses (4-10 cs) and longest beforeadverbial modifiers and between completesentences."
(p. 48).In a study of the intonational properties ofrelative clauses in British English, Taglicht(1977) compared the speech of a news broadcastwith impromptu speech, and found that bothgenres separated nonrestrictive relative clausesprosodically.
The news broadcast also separateda large proportion (71%) of the restrictiverelative clauses prosodically.A recent and very extensive study of thegrammtical properties of intonation units, or toneunits (I'U) is Altenberg (1987).
He studied amonologue of 48 minutes duration from theLondon-Lurid Corpus of spoken English, and hisresults concerning the correlation of clauseboundaries and tone unit boundaries arepresented in Table 3 at the end.4.
ConclusionThe study reported above shows that basicclauses, including basic noun phrases, are stableand surface recognizable units in the definitionsthey were given here, and that both finitary andstochastic methods can be used to find them inunrestricted text with a high degree of success.The comparison between the error rate of thesetwo methods howed that the stochastic methodperformed better both in the recognition of basicnoun phrases and basic clauses, which is anunexpected result.REFERENCES\[I\] Allen, Jonathan., Hunnicutt, M.Sharon.
