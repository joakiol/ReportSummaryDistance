Thegazetteer resource is accessible via a num-ber of routes, not currently as linked databut in formats that do provide connectionsbetween a number of different datasets.
Inparticular, connections between the histor-ical gazetteer and the Unlock1and GeoN-ames2gazetteer services have been es-tablished along with links to the Keyto English Place-Names database3.
Thegazetteer is available via the Unlock APIand in the final part of the paper wedescribe how the Edinburgh Geoparser,which forms the basis of Unlock Text, hasbeen adapted to allow users to georefer-ence historical texts.1 IntroductionPlace and time are important concepts for histori-cal scholarship and it has frequently been observedthat an ability to examine document sets throughspatial and temporal filters is one that is highlyuseful to historians.
Georeferencing (or geopars-ing) is therefore a technology that has been appliedto historical data in numerous projects (for exam-ple Hitchcock et al.
(2011), Crane (2004), Rupp etal.
(2013), Isaksen et al.
(2011), Hinrichs et al.
(toappear 2014), Grover et al.
(2010)).
A significantproblem, however, is that available georeferenc-ing tools are mostly only able to access moderngazetteer information, meaning that place-namesthat have changed over time are less likely to berecognised and are highly unlikely to be prop-1http://edina.ac.uk/unlock/2http://www.geonames.org3http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/erly grounded to correct coordinates.
The prob-lems can be illustrated with two examples, firstthe name Jorvik which is a well-known historicalname for the English city of York and second thename Bearla, a historical name attested in a docu-ment from 1685 for the modern settlement Barlowin the West Riding of Yorkshire (now North York-shire).
A first observation is that a named entityrecognition (NER) component of a georeferencingsystem may or may not recognise these as place-names: recognition will depend on the lexical re-sources or training data used as well as the docu-ment context in which the name occurs.
Assumingboth the names can be recognised, they must thenbe disambiguated with reference to a gazetteer sothat coordinates can be assigned to them.
A searchfor the names using Unlock Places, which pro-vides access to Ordnance Survey records, returnsno results for either.
A search in GeoNames re-turns York for Jorvik but nothing for Bearla.
An-other historical form for Barlow is Borley: bothGeoNames and Unlock have records for a mod-ern Borley in Essex but this is clearly not the cor-rect interpretation of the historical Borley.
Theseexamples illustrate some of the problems and in-dicate that a historian wanting to georeference aparticular document will get patchy output at bestfrom current technology.The Digital Exposure of English Place-names(DEEP) project4has addressed these issues bydigitising and processing the Survey of En-glish Place-Names to create the DEEP Histori-cal Gazetteer (DHG).
Below we first describe theSurvey of English Place-Names and then explainhow we have used XML-based language process-ing tools to convert the digitised volumes into theDHG and other structured resources.
We outlinethe ways in which the resources are made availableto users and we discuss the modifications we havemade to the Edinburgh Geoparser to allow users to4http://englishplacenames.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/119Figure 1: Survey entry for Barlow in the West Riding of Yorkshiregeoreference their historical documents.
We con-clude by discussing some outstanding issues andconsider the steps that will be needed to turn ourresources into linked data.2 The Survey of English Place-NamesThe Survey of English Place-Names is a schol-arly body of work aimed primarily at readers in-terested in the origins and development of theplace-names of England.
The Survey is arrangedby historic counties, with the first volume, from1925, covering Buckinghamshire, and the most re-cent volume, published in 2012, dealing with partof Shropshire.
In the early volumes the Surveywas largely limited to major place-names, i.e.
thenames of towns and villages, but from the 1950sonwards the volumes have become more complexand include many minor names as well as field-names and street-names.
More recently treatedcounties are described across multiple volumesand the growing scale of coverage has meant thatthere are still some counties which are only partlycovered or not covered at all.
Nevertheless, thevast majority of the English counties have beensurveyed and the resulting body of work is a valu-able resource for scholars of many kinds.Figure 1 shows an excerpt from p. 23 of Vol.33 of the Survey (1961) which covers the Wapen-takes of Barkston Ash, Skyrack and Ainsty in theWest Riding of Yorkshire.
The excerpt shows thestart of the entry for Barlow, the first settlement de-scribed in the parish of Brayton.
In brackets afterthe name is an Ordnance Survey (OS) map refer-ence followed by an indication of the pronuncia-tion of the name.
Next comes a block of historicalforms of the name with information about their at-testations.
For example, Bernlega is attested in adocument dated around 1030 referred to by the ab-breviation YCh 7, standing for volume 7 of EarlyYorkshire Charters (ed.
W. Farrer, C. T. Clay,1914-55).
A set of related forms, Berlai, Berlaia,Berley, Berleye, Berlay, and Berlaye, have beenattested in several documents ranging from theDomesday Book (DB) in 1086 through to Inqui-sitions post mortem (Ipm) in 1498.
Other forms,including Borley and Bearla discussed above, fol-low.
The final paragraph deals with the etymologyof the name, relating it to the Old English wordsfor ?barn?
or ?barley?
(and for the second part tothe element l?eah meaning ?clearing?
).3 Conversion to structured formatIt can be seen from Figure 1 that the Survey pro-vides a wealth of information with the potentialto be useful for many purposes and, in particular,it contains precisely the kind of information thatis needed to make a historical gazetteer.
In theDEEP project we have digitised all 86 volumes ofthe Survey and have processed the output of OCRto convert it into a structured format.As the example illustrates, the format of the vol-umes is semi-structured with a fairly consistentuse of style and font to indicate various kinds ofinformation (e.g.
bold font for etymological ele-ments, italics for historical forms).
The layout isextremely important with every comma and tabcontributing to the interpretation of the informa-tion.
For this reason, OCR quality needs to be ex-ceptionally high and we have been fortunate thatour digitisation partner was able to ensure this highquality.
As the survey was created over a period ofdecades under the supervision of several editors,there is some variability in format across the vol-umes.
The most pertinent variation concerns gridreferences: early volumes either do not have anyor use grid references that cannot be converted to120Figure 2: Processing pipelinelatitude/longitude.
In many of the later volumesmodern OS grid references or older OS sheet-number grid references are provided for main set-tlements within parishes and sometimes for moreminor settlements.
However, many of the latervolumes do not contain any grid references at alland a significant part of the processing deals withthese problems (see Section 3.2).3.1 Processing pipelineFigure 2 shows the XML-based processingpipeline that we have created for converting fromthe OCR output of a Survey volume into a heavilyannotated XML version of the volume?s text.
Theinput is not raw OCR output but a version in whichhuman OCR correctors have also added pseudo-XML tags to indicate very high level structure cor-responding to the nesting of blocks of text.
Thusthe block of text for a parish contains subordinateblocks for settlements within that parish and theyin turn contain subordinate blocks for minor placesand street- and field-names located within them.The parish text blocks are themselves containedwithin blocks for larger historical administrativeunits such as hundreds, wapentakes, wards, bor-oughs, chapelries etc.
and the block that encom-passes all the places within it is the county itself.In step 1 in Figure 2 the input file is convertedfrom Word (.doc file) to OpenOffice?s XML (.odt)format.
From this we extract the textual content,the manually added structural tags and all relevantfont and style information.
The manual structuralmark-up is converted to XML elements so thatcontainment relations between places are encodedin the tree-structure of the XML document.
Fromthis point all further processing incrementally addsmark-up within the XML structure.We use the LT-XML2 and LT-TTT2 tools whichform the basis of the Edinburgh Geoparser andwhich have been developed specifically for rule-based processing of text in NLP systems (Groverand Tobin (2006), Tobin et al.
(2010)).
Along withshell scripting these tools allow us to build up thecomponents that comprise the pipeline.
The out-put of step 2 contains XML elements for para-graphs, sentences and word/punctuation tokens.Font and style information is encoded as attributeson the tokens and line break hyphenation is re-paired.
Part-of-speech tagging is unnecessary: thenamed entity classes we recognise are primarilyidentified by position in the document or on thepage in combination with font and style informa-tion.Once the tokens are marked up, finer-grainedstructural mark-up can be computed inside thewider structure (step 3).
Blocks of attestationsand etymology descriptions are identified andthe title lines of the sections are segmented intoelements?e.g.
in Figure 1 BARLOW is marked upas the modern name of the place, 97-6428 is recog-nised as a grid reference and "ba:l@ is recognised asa pronunciation.
Also at this stage, lists of smallerplace-, field- and street-names are segmented intoindividual items.The NER processing in step 4 uses specially de-veloped rule sets to add detailed mark-up insidesets of attestations.
The first line of the attestationsin Figure 1 is given the following structure (tokeni-sation, font and style information suppressed):<altset><alt><histform>Bernlege</histform><attested><date>c.
1030</date><source id="wr796">YCh <item>7</item></source></attested></alt></altset>Here YCh is the source of the attestation for thehistorical form Bernlege and the interpretation ofthe YCh abbreviation is referenced by the id at-121tribute on the source element.
Step 4 also uses rulesets to recognise parts of etymological descrip-tions adding within-sentence mark-up like this:<s> ...<etympart><lang>OE</lang><form>bern</form></etympart>?<gloss>barn</gloss>?
(v.<etympart><pn-element>bere-aern</pn-element></etympart>) ...</s>Step 5 applies rules for non-geographic ground-ing.
For dates, begin and end attributes are com-puted with obvious values for simple dates anddate ranges, a twenty-year window for circa dates,other sized windows for century parts (e.g.
the firsttwenty-five years for the early part of a century)and specific periods for regnal dates (Hy 1 denotesHenry I who reigned from 1100 to 1135):<date begin="1086" end="1086">1086</date><date begin="1130" end="1139">1130-9</date><date begin="1020" end="1040">c.
1030</date><date begin="1200" end="1225">e.
13</date><date begin="1100" end="1135">Hy 1</date>Place-name elements (<pn-element>) are dealtwith at the same stage.
These are etymologicalparts, indicated with bold font in the Survey texts,which belong to a finite set of vocabulary itemsused in place-names.
Place-name elements arecatalogued in the Key To English Place-Names(KEPN) database.
We look the elements up inKEPN and record their database ID when a matchis successful.
The final two steps in the processingrelate to geographic grounding and are describedin more detail in the next section.We have not been able to perform a formal eval-uation of the NER component in the pipeline be-cause we do not have a manually annotated testset.
However, we did implement cycles of qual-ity assurance by place-name experts to feed intorule set improvements, so we are confident thatthe information extracted is of high quality.
Ourmain priority was to capture the historical nameattestations for the parishes and main settlementsin the Survey.
For the blocks that these occur in(e.g.
the attestation block in Figure 1) we can getan informal indication of performance by count-ing the number of non-punctuation tokens that failto be recognised as part of a historical name orattestation entity.
For example, for the three vol-umes for Derbyshire (published in 1959), thereare 342 blocks of main settlement attestations inwhich our system found 4,052 historical forms as-sociated with 5,817 attestations.
There were ninelines of text in these blocks where the processingfailed to assign all the words to an entity, result-ing in around 20 histform-attestation pairs beingmissed.
Performance is slightly more variable forsmaller settlements and lists of streets and field-names, but it is harder to estimate an error rate forthese.3.2 Georeferencing the SurveyTo create a historical gazetteer, we need to asso-ciate coordinates with every place-name and wedo this by aggregating information from severalsources and by allowing un-georeferenced place-names to inherit coordinates from a place higher inthe XML structure.
As described above, some ofthe Survey volumes associate grid references withsome of the places but the coverage is too sporadicto rely on.
We therefore use the geographic infor-mation in the KEPN database to acquire reliablegeo-references as far as possible.
KEPN supplieslatitude/longitude point coordinates for major set-tlements (the larger units inside parishes) and weautomatically query KEPN for these references,adding the coordinates into the XML in special<geo> elements.
For our example of Barlow the<geo> is this:<geo source="kepn" kepnref="14600" long="-1.02337"lat="53.7489" placename="Barlow"/>This information is the most authoritative geo-graphic information that we can access but we donot want to discard the other authoritative sourceof information contained in the grid referencesin some of the volumes, especially since thesemay be attached to smaller places not covered byKEPN.
We therefore recognise them during theprocessing, convert them to latitude/longitude andstore their coordinates in <geo source=?epns?>elements:<geo source="epns" lat="53.7489" long="-1.02337"/>(In this case the coordinates from the two sourcesare identical but there are cases where they differslightly.
)Once we have stored KEPN/EPNS geographicinformation, we implement strategies to achievehigh-quality georeferencing of some of the placeswhich do not yet have a georeference.
A firststep is to utilise the containment relations be-tween places and propagate known georeferencesup and down between certain nodes.
For exam-ple, we do this when a parish with no georefer-ence has the same name as a settlement withinit?since they are different administrative levelsof the same place, we propagate the <geo> fromthe settlement to the parish.
We aim to providean authoritative georeference for every parish and122larger settlement in the output, and we have man-ually built a separate additional resource to supplymissing coordinates for 560 parishes/settlementsin the entire collection that couldn?t be georefer-enced using either the volume itself or the KEPNdatabase.
While some of these are missing fromthe database, many are present but couldn?t be un-ambiguously matched because of differences inspelling and punctuation.At this point there are still many smaller placeswhich do not have a georeference, so we turnto external resources, namely OS data providedthrough Unlock and the GeoNames gazetteer.
Weuse the geoparser in a non-standard set-up to lookup place-names in the external gazetteers and toselect the most probable records.
To get the re-sults, we feed the geoparser algorithm with the in-formation that we already know from the previouslook-up in KEPN/EPNS and we set parameters tochoose records which are as close as possible tothe known coordinates either of the place-name it-self or of its immediate parent or child node.
Wealso apply the geoparser not to whole documentsbut to individual parishes.
This is because the geo-resolver maximises geographical coherence in itsinput by choosing coordinates for all the placesthat will minimize the distance between them?ifit is set to work on a single parish, it will auto-matically tend to select records which are as closeto each other as possible.
In our running exam-ple, Barlow is the first settlement described in theparish of Brayton and the other major settlementswithin the parish are Brayton, Burn, Gateforth,Hambleton and Thorpe Willoughby.
The georeso-lution algorithm looks at the parish and considerspossible groundings of these places together, en-suring as far as possible that the chosen gazetteerrecords cluster tightly together.
If either Unlock orGeoNames does not have a correct entry for oneof the places but it does have an entry for some-where else with the same name, that other entrywould be incorrectly chosen.
To remedy this sit-uation, we filter the georesolution output and dis-card any choices which are further than a certaindistance (3km) away from coordinates assigned bythe earlier KEPN/EPNS step which are known tobe correct.
This conservative strategy sometimesresults in correct groundings being thrown awaybut it ensures that the Unlock and GeoNames in-formation that we add is highly likely to be cor-rect.
The output at this stage for Barlow containstwo more <geo> elements in addition to the twoalready created:<geo source="geonames" gazref="geonames:2656317"lat="53.7499300" long="-1.0216400"/><geo source="unlock" gazref="unlock:4580690"lat="53.74993" long="-1.02164"/>The georeferencing with Unlock and GeoN-ames considers smaller places as well.
In ourexample there are three minor settlements in theparish, Brayton Barff, Burton Hall and HambletonHough, which get assigned coordinates from theOS information in Unlock.4 User access to the processed dataThe XML annotated files that are output from theprocessing pipeline are an intermediate represen-tation of the information in the Survey which isthen converted to other formats in order to makeit available to users.
Figure 3 summarises how thedata is handled after this point.
Since the XMLoutput preserves the textual content of the inputvolumes along with layout, font and style informa-tion, it can be used to provide HTML renderings ofthe text that are visually very similar to the originalprinted text.
The website at EPNS5builds on thisaspect of the XML output by providing a browseand search interface to all the text associated witha place-name, including both the historical attes-tation information and the etymological descrip-tions.
Access to this website is restricted to aca-demic users but it provides an invaluable resourcefor place-name scholars since the information canbe searched using the mark-up that we have added(e.g.
by map coordinates; by date or source of at-testation; by presence of etymological elements orlanguages, etc.
).On the geographic side, the XML annotatedfiles are converted to a structured format whichstores just the historical gazetteer informationfrom the Survey (the DHG).
The textual contentis discarded while the relevant annotations aretransformed into a data structure conforming tothe Library of Congress Metadata Authority De-scription Schema (MADS)6.
Figure 4 shows partsof the MADS record for Barlow.
The modernname is encoded in the mads/authority/geographicelement, while the historical variants appear inmads/variant/geographic elements.
Geographi-cal coordinates appear in mads/extension/geo el-ements and attestations, linked to particular vari-ants, are also put in the extension element.
Thehistorical forms may be unexpanded shorthandsfrom the original volumes, e.g.
Berlai(a) mean-ing either Berlai or Berlaia, so these are expanded5http://epns.nottingham.ac.uk6http://www.loc.gov/standards/mads/123Figure 3: Accessing the DEEP Historical Gazetteerout in mads/extension/searchterm elements to as-sist indexing for search.
The MADS format feedsall the access mechanisms to the DHG?the data isingested into the DEEP gazetteer website7whichallows unrestricted search and browsing access.
Itis also converted into Unlock?s gazetteer format inorder that it can be used programmatically via theUnlock API, adding a new resource for users ofUnlock Places.
The Unlock Text service is oneto which users submit documents for geoparsing,and this has been extended to allow them to do thisusing the DHG.
The following section briefly de-scribes how we have adapted the Edinburgh Geop-arser for this purpose.5 Geoparser adaptationsThe Edinburgh Geoparser in Unlock standardlygeoreferences users?
documents with reference tothe Ordnance Survey and/or GeoNames gazetteersin Unlock.
We have reported on this system in To-bin et al.
(2010) and evaluated its performance onboth modern newspaper text and a variety of his-torical texts.
Other researchers have adapted it foruse on different collections of historical text (Isak-sen et al., 2011).
The two main components of thegeoparser are a rule-based NER system for recog-nising place-names in text and a heuristics-basedgeoresolver to ground the place-names to coordi-nates (i.e.
to choose between competing gazetteerrecords).
In order to update the geoparser to usethe historical gazetteer effectively, both of thesecomponents need to be extended.
We have madethe necessary adaptations so that Unlock Text canbe used on historical English documents, howeverit is hard to create a one-size-fits-all version of thesystem which will perform optimally for all users7http://placenames.org.ukon all documents?we return to this issue in thefinal section.Like many other rule-based NER systems, theNER component in the Edinburgh Geoparser re-lies in part on lexicons of known entities of rele-vant types and in part on descriptions of possiblecontexts for entities encoded as rules.
For mod-ern names the geoparser NER system uses exten-sive place-name lexicons both for Great Britainand globally.
To deal with historical names, weconverted the MADS-format data into a lexiconof over 500,000 unique entries derived from thesearchterms and the modern names and we filteredit to exclude certain lower case forms correspond-ing to common words.
The NER system was givena parameter to specify ?historical mode?
and thiscauses the DHG-derived lexicon to be applied in-stead of the modern place-name lexicons.
Rulesfor place-name contexts apply as usual, as do rulesand lexical look-up for other entity types.For the georesolution component, the DHG wasadded to the list of available gazetteers.
Using itresults in a set of records with associated coor-dinates that need to be disambiguated in order toground the place-names.
This is sufficient for useof the DHG in georeferencing but there are someextra functionalities that suggest themselves in thiscontext.
The first concerns the users?
knowledgeabout the geographic focus of their documents: as-suming they know that the document is about aparticular county or sub-area of England, it is use-ful to constrain the georeferencing results to ex-clude out-of-area interpretations.
To achieve thiswe allow the user to specify one or more of theDHG counties as a constraint.
A second extensionfollows from the fact that Unlock returns DHGrecords that include date of attestation.

The geop-arser was run with the county constraint set to?Dorset?

The third paneshows the coordinates for the gazetteer entries thathave been returned.
The first (purple) coordinatesare the preferred ones and the remaining (green)ones are lower ranked alternatives.
Note that be-cause we use only the historical gazetteer and aDorset constraint, several of the modern namesare not grounded (e.g.
Westminster, Taunton).
Thecorrect Westminster is in the Survey under Mid-8This is the full text, i.e.
OCR-ed version, ofthe document at https://archive.org/details/fullabstractsfe00frygoog.dlesex and therefore not accessed.
In the case ofTaunton, there are two instances in the DHG: amodern name for a minor settlement in Surrey anda historical form of modern Taynton in Glouces-tershire.
The actual interpretation is likely to bemodern Taunton in Somerset, which is one of thecounties not yet in the Survey.
Several of the his-torical place-names recognised in the text have notbeen grounded to a place in Dorset.
There are en-tries in the DHG for some of these, e.g.
a Bundebiin Lincolnshire and a Rading in Berkshire.6 DiscussionThe example in Figure 5 is intended to illustratesome of the issues that are involved in using thegeoparser on a particular historical text.
The userwho wants this particular text georeferenced has anumber of options.
Without using any constrainton the area to be considered, many of the place-names would be wrongly grounded.
The Dorset-only constraint is probably too conservative andthe user might instead prefer to use a different op-tion available as standard with the geoparser whichis to specify a bounding box or circle to weight theentries within them more highly.
This option dif-fers from the Dorset-only constraint, which onlyconsiders DHG entries known to be in Dorset, in125Figure 5: Visualisation of geoparser output on Dorset Feet of Finesthat it considers entries from all of the counties andinfluences the rankings of the possible entries.
Theuser can follow it with a clean-up stage to removegroundings which fall outside the bounding boxor circle.
To get interpretations for place-nameslike Westminster and Taunton, the user could sub-mit the document to a second run of the geoparserusing the modern OS gazetteer and then combinethe results of the two runs.
Alternatively, the usermight opt to manually post-edit the output of thegeoparser: a tool would be useful for this so weare planning to add a map-based georeference an-notation capability to the geoparser.The Edinburgh Geoparser is available as a ser-vice from Unlock Text but there are so many typesof historical document and so many user needs,that it is unlikely to provide all the possible op-tions and flexibility that might be required.
Forthis reason we anticipate that many users willprefer to access the DHG via Unlock Places forintegration with their own systems; other userswill want access to the source of the geoparserin order to tailor it for their specific needs.
Anopen source version will shortly be available fromhttp://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk.The data described here is not linked datain the usual sense of the term (i.e.
it is notRDF).
However, we have been careful to addas many linkages as we can.
The core datastructure is the MADS data collection (Figure 4)and this contains two kinds of URI: in thevalueURI attribute on mads/authority/geographicthere is a link to the relevant page on theEPNS website, while in the valueURI attributeon mads/recordInfo/recordContentSource there isa link to the placenames.org.uk site.
Three of themads/extension/geo elements contain referencesto external data sources: the kepnref id points tothe KEPN database and gazref ids point to the rel-evant records in Unlock and GeoNames.
Becausethe MADS data collection conforms to a recog-nised standard, it would be relatively easy to con-vert it to RDF and publish it as linked data.
More-over, the Unlock version of the DHG retains allthe information in the MADS collection and thismeans that the output of the geoparser can be madeto retain the links out from the entries, enabling theuser to link their historical texts to the DHG and toKEPN, Unlock and GeoNames.AcknowledgementsDEEP was funded by JISC?s Digitisation and Con-tent Programme.
