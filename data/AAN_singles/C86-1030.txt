INTRODUCTIONWe interest  ourse lves in the analys is  phase ofa machine t rans lat ion system which adopts theindirect, t ransfer  and global approach (see\ [S locum 84\]).
The aim of this paper is to c lar i fythe prob lem areas, suggest a few solutions, andpo int  out  the loose ends.
There is no currentimplementat ion for the analyser we describe, andthe ideas are bas ica l ly  a ref lect ion of ~hat ~cwould  like to see in an MT system, based on previousexper ience in the field.
A very important issue isto separate the l inguist ic  knowledge (the grammar)from the a lgor i thmic and technical  knowledge (theorgan\ ]sat \ ]on  of the analyser, pattern matching,etc.).
"Approximate" l inguist ic  knowledge is alsoseparated and used as a means to guide the analysisrather  than considered as absolute (semantics andcontext  constra ints  as heur is t ics  instead ofgrammar rules).Due to space restr ict ions,  we shall immedia-tely specify the basic type of analyser  we shall bework ing with, wi thout  giving any reasons for thecho ice .
The interested reader is referred to\ [Zaharin 85\] for an uncondensed vers ion of thispaper, and \ [Zahar in 86\] for more details.2.
THE ANALYSERIn general,  an analyser can be v iewed as ab lack box with two holes, where we insert the inputtext through one and it gives the output  l inguist icstructure through the other (in our case, anannotated tree represent ing the "meaning" of theinput text).
Peeping into the box, we would noticethat it works in cycles doing the fo l lowing fivesteps unti l  it tr iggers off some stopping mechanismand hence furn ish ing the output  :a) comput ing the object  set ;b) choosing an object  ;c) comput ing the rule set ;d) choosing a rule ;e) apply ing the chosen rule on the chosenobject.Natural ly,  depending on the var ious models,these steps need not be executed in the given order,nor are they necessar i ly  as clear out.
Indeed, somemay even execute the cycles in paral lel .Our analyser wil l  do the five steps in thefo l lowing manner.
Steps (a) and (c) wi l l  be donetogether, comput ing all objects on which some ruleis appl icable,  and to each of these objects, the setof all appl icable rules is computed.
The result  is aset of \].inked pairs O-R where R is a rule appl icableon the object  O.
A l inked pai r  is then picked,i.e.
steps (b) and (d) together, and the chosen ruleappl ied on the chosen object.
The cycle repeats.The mot ivat ion for the above choice is that weare a iming for a one-go analysis, for which we shallbe needing the maximum of information before weapply  a rule, hence the computat ion of al l  candidateobjects  and rules.
Strategies and heur ist ics  arethen needed for the cr i t ical  choice of object-ru lepair  in each cycle.~L~ natural  language treated wi l l  bedescr ibedby a grammar conta in ing a set of rewri te rules witha context  free base of the form Xl .

,Xn,X are annotated trees ; in other words,an augmented context  free grammar.
What  we actual lyhave in mind is a grammar conta in ing rules of theform given in f igure i, as d iscussed in \[Zaharin 86\].Nevertheless,  the d iscuss ion remains val id for anysystem using a similar representat ion of data.AS in most  machine translat ion systems, theanalysis  looks for only a single solution, i.e.
asingle representat ion of meaning for each inputtext.
If the text is ambiguous, the "best" solut ionis taken.
In the search for a solution, a depthf irst  approacb is taken, and the analyser al lowsfor backtrack ing in case the solut ion is not foundin one go.
Backtrack ing is also requi red in caseswhere an input sentence is not in the language ofthe gralnmar, but most important, to ensure that theanalyser  f inds a solut ion if there is one.3.
THE PROBLEM AREASWith the type of analyser we have chosen, theproblems that ar ise are bas ica l ly  the fo l lowing :- pattern matching ;ambiguit ies  ;- forward propagat ion ;checking for correctness ;~ backtracking.Pattern matching seems to be the bott leneck ofthe real \ ]sat \ ]on of any system.
Fortunately,  thel i terature a lready contains some ef f ic ient  patternmatch ing procedures  that can be modi f ied to suitour model.136The choice of an augmented context  free gralmnarmeans that the rules are bas ica l ly  in the fo rm ofstr ings of symbols, where each symbol is augmentedwith an annotated tree structure.
F igure i gives anexample of a rule we use (see \[Zaharin 86\]).
In thisform, the pattern matching can be carr ied out in twostages : one fo r  strings, fo l lowed by one for trees,~\]ere the latter (the more cost ly one) is t r iggeredonly in cases of success of the former.Chartname : ChNPXNODE =CHART =TREE =NP I , NP 2 + NPNP!
N~2NP NPa l l  a l lNP NPIJB~ p r e i{~) --B~F~2-NPNPChNPXNPNPF~re \ ]For instance, at the str ing level, this fallsinto the category of many pat tern /many objectpat tern  matching for strings,for which the procedureof \[Aho & Coras ick  75\] which finds all patterns  andall  ob jects  in one pass seems suitable.
Only incases of success do we pass on to a tree patternmatch ing process, for instance that of \ [Hoffmann &O'Donnel  791\].
Repet i t ive work can be avoided if wefactor ise the results of the pattern matching fromone cycle to the other.Ambigu i t ies  and forward propagat ion are the twomajor problems for the model.
We defer the discus-sion on t~ese to the next two sections.In genecal, it is very d i f f icu l t  to descr ibe anatural  language exact ly  by means of a formalgrammar, no matter how sophist icated the formalism.In spike of this, the cr i ter ia for the correctnessof the resul t  of the analys is  is usual ly  with res-peck to the natural  language treated and not that ofthe grammar, i.e.
f inding an axiom in the gra1~narmay not be suff icient.
So, rather than wr i t ing verystr ict  rules at the r isk of exc luding correct struc-tures, it is better  to have more genera\], rules whichmay accept anomalous structures, and then provide af i l ter to re ject  such results.
\ [Boitet & Gerber 84\]suggests an expert  system to do this post -analys ischecking.For backtrack ing analysis, a simple model is tostore fa i led conf igurat ions (dead states) in somefile.
At the beginn ing of each cycle, the new confi-gurat ion can be checked against  this file, backtra-cking further if it compares.
This may seem a hugeeffort, but natural  language analysis  is such thatmany identical  nodes may be found in d i f ferent  partsof the search space.
As for forward propagat ion inthe backtrack ing analysis, the pr ior i ty  order ings tobe d iscussed in 5 can be preserved and made use ofhere.4.
AMBIGUIT IESAmbigu i t ies  haunt  every t reatment  of a naturallanguage.
\[Lepage 85\] summarises the types of ambi-guit ies that we face, both lexical  and structural,whi le \[Van Kl inken 84\] wr i tes on the methods used tosolve some of the cases.
However, unti l  a formaltreatment of ambiguit ies  can be proposed, the solu-tions wi l l  remain ad hoc, treat ing case by case aswe meet them.In general,  lexica\] ambigui t ies  are solvedeither grammatical ly,  with context, or with seman-tics.
Grammatica l ly  is as in the sense of usingagreement in number to obtain "that" as a conjunc-t ion instead of a determiner  in the sentence :We know that  ambigui t ies  are d i f f icu l t  to solve.We use context  to d is t inguish the past  part ic ip le"col lected" from the verb in the two sentences :The corals co\] lected at the bottom of the sea arebeautiful .The corals co\] lected at the bot tom of the sea.Finally, \ [Lyt inen 85\] polnted out the need of seman-tics to determine the attachraen't of the preposi t io-nal noun phrase ":\[or '~iO" in the two sentences(based on the verb "found") :The c leaners dry-c leaned the coat that Mary foundthe rummage sale for ~ .
atThe c leaners drv-cleaned_ - -  the coat that Mary f oun<!.in the garbage foE__,}!
q.Whereas we can be quite certain of the so \ ]u t io~obta ined grammatical ly,  the use of context  or seman-t ics does not inspire the same confidence.
Contextcan pose problems when locat ing the elements thecontext  refers to, which can be arb i t rar i ly  far awayfrom the ambiguous word.
Furthermore,  the problemcan he aggravated by the elements looked for beingambiguous themselves.
Sometimes, negative constraintsare used ~n context e\].ements, and these carl poseinterpretat ion problems (see \[Zaharin 86\]).
As forsemantics, the arguments can be endless.Bear ing the above in mind, we prefer  to treat?
k\]-te solut ion of \]6~5{I(Ia1 amhlg | \ ] i~ je  m m~ hel lrist{?
~,rather than steadfast rules.
By this we mean thatcontext  and semantics should not be incorporatedin to  the grammar rules used to descr ibe the languagetreated, but instead should be p laced in relatedheur ist ic  rules which advise on the apml icabi l i ty  oftheir counterparts.
This also means that if theiradvice has not led to a success, it is possible tobacktrack to the same rule and recommence, this timeignor ing the advice.
The case would not have beenposs ib le  if the grammar rule and the context andSemantics had been put together in one rule.In the case of structural  ambiguit ies,  thesentence can be inherent ly  ambiguous, in which casecontext and semantics heur ist ic  rules can only aidto pick the preferred reading.
It is also poss ib lethat structural  ambJguitLes occur only at the levelof substr ings of the sentence, but some of the possi-b i l i t ies  wil l  not lead to a solution.
In such a case,heur ist ic  rules for preferred readings wil l  alsohelp, but the problem is more of choosing a rule orobject  to avoid leading to a dead end.
This fallsinto the categorv of problems to be d iscussed in thenext section.5.
FORWARD PROPAGATIONForward propagat ion is the problem of choosinga rule and an object  for appl icat ion in each cycleof the analyser.
This is the execut ion of steps (b)and (d) in section 2, which is then fell.owed bystep (e), complet ing the cycle.
As we are aiming fora solut ion in one pass of the analysis,  the choiceis cr it ical ,  as even a wrong choice of a sequence ofappl icat ions may lead to a dead end.
This can be seenJ n the fo\] \].owing example where the  grammar containsthe rules (omitting the details) :137R 1 : NP VK NP + VCL ; R 3 : RELCL PNP ?
RELCLR 2 : NP RELCL ?
NP ; R 4 : VCL PNP + VCLTaking an example in \[Lyt inen 85\], the analysismay f ind itself  in the stats given in f igure 2 (thecandidate objects are c i rc led and the correspondingrule indicated).
The sequence of appl icat ions neededin this example is R2 R1 R 4.
If we happen to chooseR 1 , before R2, we wi l l  f ind that the analysis  wi l lnot lead to a solution.. .
.
..... :i: .!
:, ,!, ,,o /h6The situat ion given here is one of the majorproblems faced by analyses which predef ine thesequence of appl icat ions of rules.
There is noth ingmore f rustrat ing than not obtain ing a complete ana-lysis and yet knowing that the requi red rules arepresent  in the grammar.Instead of predef in ing a sequence of ruleappl ications, we prefer  using heur ist ic  rules whichapply independent ly  in each cycle of the analyser.These heur ist ic  rules act to determine a pr ior i tyorder ing of the candidate rules and objects (eachrule wil l  be tied to the object it is appl icable on),the highest  pr ior i ty  rule or object being chosen forappl icat ion (taking along the object  or rule it istied to).The big quest ion is, what should these heur is-tic rules contain ?
F i rst  and foremost, coming fromthe d iscuss ion on solving ambiguit ies in section 4,we need the treatment of semantics put down as heu-ristics.
An example of such a case is in f igure 2where rule R 3 should be accompanied by a heur ist icrule to check for semantics.
Here, one does not"find" something "in the garbage" "for ~i0", and sothe heur ist ics  would advise that R 3 should not apply(unless, as d iscussed before, fol lowing this heuris-tics leads to a dead end, and so we come back toapply R3).We shall refer to the type of heur ist ics  justused as the "to-apply-or-not- to-apply"  heurist ics.The type of heur ist ics  main ly  needed is the "after-you-or -af ter -me" heurist ics.
This is the case forthe choice between R1 and R2 in f igure 2.For the said problem, one may argue that VCLsare h igher up in the  hierarchy of phrases and clau-ses than NPs \[Vauquois & Chappuy 85\], and so rulesbui ld ing NPs should be appl ied before rules bui ld ingVCLs.
This may be true in this example, but  caremust be taken when we deal with complex c lauses andphrases (the h ierarchy given in the reference is fors imple c lauses and phrases).
For complex clauses andphrases, we may obtain cycl ic h ierarchies betweenNPs and RELCLs, APs and NPs, etc.
For such cases,ad hoc heur is t ics  are needed, for instance, rulesbui ld ing RELCLs should apply before rules bui ld ingNPs if the former is found to the r ight of thelatter, and the inverse otherwise.Apart  from some hierarchy given, context  canalso be used to solve the "after :you-or-after-me"problem.
(Recall that context  is also needed tosolve ambiguit ies).
As examples, suppose the grammarfor f igure 2 also contains the rules (still omit t ingdetails) :R5 : NP VK + VCL ; R8 : SCL VCL ?
VCLR6 : NP VK AP ?
VCL ; R9 : SCL VK AP ?
VCLR7 : CONJ VCL ?
SCLChecking the context, namely the conjunct ion"when" or "that", can be used to choose R5 on "theking rides" in f igure 3, whi le RI is chosen inf igure 4 (this also gives an example as to why wewould not use heur is t ics  l ike "apply the rule withthe longer LHS")..~ ,d  Rl ,C~) "~ vK )When the king r ies  the/t h~orse i s-gr!omedThat ~ ~ c  h6rse is unbelievableF i/gur e 4In the example in f igure 3, it so happens thatthe two occurrences of the rules R5 are independent,in the sense that the appl icat ion of one before theother has no great consequence,  and so an arb i t rarychoice wil l  do.
However, not compet ing on intersec-t ing objects does not necessar i ly  guarantee indepen-dence.
Had we been two steps before f igure 2 withrules :RIO : NPR NP VK + RELCL ; 1{I 1 : PNP PNP + PNPincluded in the grammar, the s i tuat ion would  be asgiven in f igure 5.
Here, semantic heur is t ics  canadvise that RII should not apply.
However, we needto make sure that RIO appl ies before RI, otherwisewe can never arr ive at a complete analys is  eventhough these objects seem to be independent.NP NPR NP RIO VK PNP RII PNP' 1 / \  I I I .
/h/2.o The cleaners dry-cleaned the coat that Mary found in th g g ~u I!No doubt the above problem can be solved usingthe same heur ist ics  giving the hierarchy of c lausesand phrases, but  this s i tuat ion br ings up two impor-tant quest ions which necess i tate  answer ing : firstly,how do we expect such s i tuat ions ?
And secondly, dowe have to know all such s i tuat ions before we canwrite a good set of heur ist ic  rules ?Before at tempt ing to answer these questions, wewish to h ighl ight  the heur is t ics  used by \[Nagao &Nakamura 82\] which looks very promis ing but maysuffer from the same drawbacks.
The reference usessentent ia l  patterns (SP) that express the globalstructure of a sentence.
If these SPs are sat is f iedby a certain conf igurat ion,  the said conf igurat ionis chosen for expansion (they use a best - f i r s tsearch where a conf igurat ion is then a node in thesearch space).For our purposes, SPS can also be adaptedeither to place checks test ing whether the analys isis on the r ight track, or to  create subgoals if someof the const i tuents  of the SP are satisf ied.138This can be useful for configurations containingspecific words which can determine its neJ ghbours.For exalnple, a conjunction necessitates a VCL orPARTCL to its right.Going back to the two questions posed earlieron, the problem of expecting the situations whereheuristic rules can be written is not a simple one.For a given derivation tree in a context free gram-mar, any cut in this tree is a possih\]e configurationof the correct analysis.
Passing this cut through the.pattern marcher will give the complete configuration?Looking at ali possible subskrlngs of this cut, andmultiply 'this by the nu~nher of alI cuts in the tier\]--ration tree will give us the situations we need topredict.
The result is by no means negligible, tosay the ieast.Fortunately, rules that can apply on intersec-ting objects can be precomputed.
In particular, ifwe use the pattern matchi.ng procedure of \[Aho &Corasick 75\] as mentioned earlier, the procedureproduces a network equipped with a failure :\[unctionindicating to which part of another rule (say Rb)the pattern matcher is to go to after successfullyfinding a pattern (say rule Ra).
This gives a possi-ble clash between rules Ra and Rb, where Ra is onthe \]eft of l{b.
For example, the clash between R1and R2 in figure 2 can be predicted by the patternmarcher, to which a heuristic rule can be written,say the one given in figure 7.
Figure 6 gives thenetwork for the pattern matcher of the referencefor the rules R\] to R4 in our example.
The failurefunction is given by f(i) where i is a state of thenetwork while the output of applicable rules isgiven by out{}ut(i) (again we omit the details ofaugmenting ea, ch arc by  the TREE value).

For examp\].e, the analyser shouldbe able to deduce from the situation in figure 5that it can get to the situation in figure 2 andhence apply the heuristic rule already written forfigure 2 (in this case the one given in figure 7).This reasoning can be done in the following mannerwith R1 applicable on "NP VK NP" (see figure 5), thefailure function for R1 points to state \] (seefigure 6), and with the applicable rule to the imme-diate right of R1 being RiO which produces a RELCL,this gets us to state 4 with output R2.We then obtain a sIightly different situation fromfigure 2 but the heuristic rule can still apply,giving priority to rule R2 hence RIO.Despite the title, we have hesitated on discus-sing strategies, because experience tel\]s us that itis very difficu\].t to write admissible strategies(i.e.
set sequences of heuristic rules).
Furthermore,strategies may be as risky as procedural methodsunless they are flexible enough.
This means that theycan be halted, created, interrupted and resumed du-ring the analysis.
Furthermore, they ought to beglobal rather than particular.
For example, the hie-rarchy of clauses and phrases can serve to choosebetween rules having the same priority after otherheuristic rules have applied, and halted when com-pIex structures are treated.
An interesting discus-sion on global and flexible strategies is \[ound in\[Hayes-Roth 85\] for the expert system OPM.REFERENCE~A.V.
