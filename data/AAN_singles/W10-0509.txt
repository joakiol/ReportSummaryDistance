?aimed at the gen-eral public.User generated data contains emotional,opinionated, sentimental, and personal posts.
Thischaracteristic makes it an interesting data sourcefor exploring new types of linguistic analysis, as isdemonstrated by research on, e.g., sentiment analy-sis [4], opinion retrieval [3], and mood detection [1].We introduce the task of experience mining.
Here,the goal is to gain insights into criteria that peopleformulate to judge or rate a product or its usage.These criteria can be formulated as the expectationsthat people have of the product in advance (i.e., thereasons to buy), but can also be expressed as reportsof experiences while using the product and compar-isons with other products.
We focus on the latter:reports of experiences with products.
In this paper,we define the task, describe guidelines for manualannotation and analyze linguistic features that canbe used in an automatic experience mining system.2 MotivationOur main use-case is user-centered design for prod-uct development.
User-centered design [2] is an in-novation paradigm where users of a product are in-volved in each step of the research and developmentprocess.
The first stage of the product design processis to identify unmet needs and demands of users fora specific product or a class of products.
Forums,?This research was supported by project STE-09-12 withinthe STEVIN programme funded by the Dutch and Flemish gov-ernments, and by the Netherlands Organisation for ScientificResearch (NWO) under projects 640.001.501, 640.002.501,612.066.512, 612.061.814, 612.061.815, 640.004.802.review sites, and mailing lists are platforms wherepeople share experiences about a subject they careabout.
Although statements found in such platformsmay not always be representative for the general usergroup, they can accelerate user-centered design.Another use-case comes from online communi-ties themselves.
Users of online forums are often in-terested in other people?s experiences with concreteproducts and/or solutions for specific problems.
Toquote one such user: [t]he polls are the only in-formation we have, though, except for individual[users] giving their own evaluations.
With the vol-ume of online data increasing rapidly, users need im-proved access to previously reported experiences.3 Experience miningExperiences are particular instances of personallyencountering or undergoing something.
We wantto identify experiences about a specific target prod-uct, that are personal, involve an activity related tothe target and, moreover, are accompanied by judge-ments or evaluative statements.
Experience miningis related to sentiment analysis and opinion retrieval,in that it involves identifying attitudes; the key dif-ference is, however, that we are looking for attitudestowards specific experiences with products, not atti-tudes towards the products themselves.4 An explorative studyTo assess the feasibility of automatic experiencemining, we carried out an explorative study: weasked human assessors to find experiences in ac-tual forum data and then examined linguistic fea-tures likely to be useful for identifying experiencesautomatically.17Mean and deviation in postsFeature with exper.

denotes probability.We acquired data by crawling two forums onshaving,1 with 111,268 posts written by 2,880 users.Manual assessments Two assessors (both authorsof this paper) were asked to search for posts on fivespecific target products using a standard keywordsearch, and label each result post as:?
reporting no experience, or?
reporting an off-target experience, or?
reporting an on-target experience.Moreover, posts should be marked as reporting anexperience only if (i) the author explicitly reportshis or someone else?s (a concrete person?s) use ofa product; and (ii) the author makes some conclu-sions/judgements about the experience.In total, 203 posts were labeled by the two asses-sors, with 101 posts marked as reporting an experi-ence by at least one assessor (71% of those an on-target experience).
The inter-annotator agreementwas 0.84, with Cohen?s ?
= 0.71.
If we mergeon- and off-target experience labels, the agreementis 0.88, with ?
= 0.76.
The high level of agreementdemonstrates the validity of the task definition.Features for experience mining We considered anumber of linguistic features and compared posts re-porting experience (on- or off-target) to the posts1www.shavemyface.com, www.menessentials.com/community2Computed using LingPipe: http://alias-i.com/lingpipeWith experience Without experienceused 0.15, found 0.09,bought 0.07, tried 0.07,got 0.07, went 0.07, started0.05, switched 0.04, liked0.03, decided 0.03got 0.09, thought 0.09,switched 0.06, meant 0.06,used 0.06, went 0.06, ig-nored 0.03, quoted 0.03,discovered 0.03, heard 0.03Table 2: Most frequent past tense verbs following I inposts with and without experience, with rel.

Table 1 lists the features andthe comparison results.
Remarkably, the subjectiv-ity score is lower for experience posts: this indicatesthat our task is indeed different from sentiment re-trieval.
Experience posts are on average twice aslong as non-experience posts and contain more sen-tences with pronoun I.
They also contain more con-tent (non-modal) verbs, especially past tense verbs.Table 2 presents a more detailed analysis of the verbuse.
Experience posts appear to contain more verbsreferring to concrete actions rather than to attitudeand perception.
It is still to be seen, though, whetherthis informal observation can be quantified using re-sources such as standard semantic verb classification(state, process, action), WordNet verb hierarchy orFrameNet semantic frames.5 ConclusionsWe introduced the novel task of experience min-ing.
Users of products share their experiences, andmining these could help define requirements fornext-generation products.
We developed annotationguidelines for labeling experiences, and used themto annotate data from online forums.
An initial ex-ploration revealed multiple features that might proveuseful for automatic labeling via classification.References[1] K. Balog, G. Mishne, and M. de Rijke.
