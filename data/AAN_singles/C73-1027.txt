~RAOUL N. SMITH - EDWARD MAXWELLAN ENGLISH DICTIONARYFORCOMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTICPROCESSING SYSTEMS1.
INTRODUCTIONR.
F. SIMMONS (1970) and M. PA~AK and A. W. PRATT (1971) pointout that no computerized system using natural anguage ither as partof the processor or as the object processed and having a syntactico-se-mantic component has a lexicon of more than a few hundred items(except for the SNOV' s medical exicon).
It is obvious from the lack?
of success of large-scale computerized systems using natural languagedata that better solutions will be reached if these systems have a largelexicon as an integra.1 component.
Our purpose is to build a large scaledictionary 1of English which will incorporate important recent researchinto language structure and which will have the potential of being usedeither as part of a computerized natural language-using system or asa large data base, itself a source for further syntactico-semantic studies.There are a number of specific problems that anyone who constructsa large-scale computerized ictionary must resolve.
First, as discussedin B,.
N. SMITH (1972) and P. B. GovE (1972), a computerized dictionarymust incorporate additional types of data than is available in standarddictionaries.
Since standard ictionaries and some of their computerizedcounterparts define words in terms of other words, they are of necessitycircular.
In addition, the efficiency of any system will depend on thesize and  form of the dictionary.
Any usable large-scale dictionary ofEnglish probably would have to contain at least 200,000 entries (in-cluding inflected forms).1 We distinguish lexicon and dictionary by considering anentry in the latter as beingthe same information asthe corresponding entry in the former but with added efinition.304 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELLIf each entry is defined as in a standard ictionary with, say, 20 wordsused in the definition then there must be storage for 4,000,000 words.In addition if, as has been proposed in N. CHOMSlIY (1965), each entryhas syntactico-semantic features attached we will encounter a similarproblem: entries probably need on the average 20 features to specifythem.
Finally, when words are arbitrarily stored in computer systems,with pointers directing the search from word to word (cf.
M. R. QmL-LIAN, 1968), the search algorithm can be long.With all of these problems in mind, we have defined a theoreticalmodel which we expect will eliminate or substantially reduce these veryreal limitations of computerized dictionaries discussed above.
The pur-pose of our research is to implement the scheme, so that it may be usedin artificial intelligence systems; as a data base for computer assistedinstruction systems (e.g.
PLATO), and as a tool for lexical testing (cf.J.
OLNEY, D. R.aMSEY, 1972) and information retrieval (e.g.
cf.
C.SALTON, 1971; W. A.
WOODS, 1972).2.
LEXICAL INFORMATIONUntil recently much of the interesting research in lexicology hasbeen carried out in the Soviet Union.
The Soviets have long been con-cerned with automated language processing and attribute the lack ofsuccess at this task to the lack of a sophisticated lexical theory.
Diction-aries are quite inadequate in giving Us insight into the nature of words.There is no way, for example, that one could learn a language usinga dictionary.
In addition, definitions in dictionaries are circular: everyword is defined in terms of every other word (actually approximately50 % of the vocabulary appears in the definitions (JOHN OLNEY, per-sonal communication)).Some of the most innovative research in Soviet lexicology has beencarried out by 2olkovsky, Mel'~uk and Apresjan (cf.
A.K.
2OLKOVSKYand I.
A. MEL'~UX, 1970, YU.
D. API~SJAN, 1967, and Yu.
D. AP~-SJAN, I.
A. MEL'&m and A. D. 2OLKOVSKY, 1969).
Initially, they feltthat the detailed syntactic properties of a word composed its meaning- in a structural rather than substantive sense.
Their approach wasfirst to classify words using grammatical criteria; for example, Apresjanclassified verbs as being able to undergo the passive transformation oras being able or unable to take a complementary infinitive, accusativeobjects or locative adverbial phrases."

7 = ~  ., ~ ~AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 305Their theory is essentially a structuralist one.
In one of their studiesthey proposed a revision of the notion "word field ".
That is, theirlexico-structural nalysis begins with an enumeration of the phrasetypes of a language, revealed by syntactic analysis; an indication ofthe frequency of each of the structural patterns; and finally an enumer-ation of the word meanings found in each pattern.In Yu.
D. APRESJAN, I.
A. MEL'~UK and A. D. 2OLKOVSKY (1969)and elsewhere they propose that a dictionary which displays "the proc-ess of text generation as an integral succession of steps" be constructed.They state that the dictionary should be based on the following prin-ciple:... it must be fully sufficient for a smooth, idiomatic and flexible ex-pression of a given meaning; that is to say, it must display in an explicitand logical form whatever information may be necessary for the correctchoice and usage of words and phrases to convey a given idea in a speechcontext.The proposed ictionary is "combinatory" because " i t  is primarilyintended to d!splay the combinatorial properties of words. "
It is "ex-planatory" because the syntactic government patterns are semanticallyinterpreted with the goal of providing idiomatic expression of anygiven meaning.The typical entry in their dictionary would have the followingformat:a) Entry wordb) Morphological informationc) Definitiond) Syntactic potential of worde) Regular lexical functionsf) Non-regular lexical functionsg) The "lexical universe" of entry11) Examplesi) Phraseology (idiomatic expressions).
j) Discrimination of synonyms and near-synonyms.Concerning the definition (c), they specify that they not be circular.They state that " i f  this requirement is met, all the definitions will inthe long run be reduced to a small number of indefinable units of mean-ing (elementary meanings). "
(This is the same goal as the UCLAlexicography project.)
An example of this can be found in McCawley's20306 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELLwork with lexical atoms (J. MCCAWLEY, 1968).
That is, redden has thesemantic atoms " cause to come to be red. "
It is important to note thatthe definition of a word should be an exact paraphrase of the wordusing these semantic atoms.The notion of lexical functions is the principle innovation of theirdictionary.
Lexical function involves establishing relationships betweenwords.
Examples from Yu.
D. APRESJAN, I, A. MEL'~UX and A. D.~OLKOVSHY (1969) are the following:(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6).
(12)(15)(18)(31)Syn=synonymSyn (to help) - to aidSyn (to call) - to nameConv-conversiveCony (to build) - to be built (by someone)Cony (to contain) - to be contained (by something)Cony (A  precedes B) -  B fol lows ACony (A  beat 13) - B loses to ACony (A  sold B to C) - C bought B from AAnti-antonymAnti (beautiful) - plain, uglyAnti (before) - afterGen - genusGen (liquid) - substanceGen (blue) - colorGen (crawl) - moveSo-noun coinciding with the verbSo (to move) - movementSo (to be white) - whitenessAo-adjectives coinciding with the verbAo (sun) - solarAo (time) - temporalSinstr-noun denoting instrument of wordSinstr (think) - brainSinstr (clap) - handsMult-noun denoting aggregateMult (flowers) - bunchMult (sheep) - flockFigur-standard figurative designationFigur (passion) - f lameFigur (misery) - abyssOper-verb connecting name of participant with actionoper (support) - to lendoper (defeat) - to sufferAN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 307(39)(46)oper (recession) - to experienceFin-verb meaning " to cease ", " to stop "Fin (sound) - to die awayFin (patience) - to loseSon-verb denoting typical soundSon (lion) - to roarSon (snake) - to hissWhat they mean by information about the lexical universe of aword is "an informal description of a suflqciendy broad piece of realityincluding the given situation as a constituent element. "
For example,the lexical universe of student would include such lexical items as books,classes, college, instructor, study, exam and so on.Finally, description of near synonyms would involve a listing of allwords connected toa lexical item by connotations.
Connotations involve,of course, literary and emotional overtones of words.
A terrorist is,for example, a guerrilla whose cause we have emotional disagreementwith.Their notion of syntactic potential corresponds somewhat to Fill-more's case frames.
That is, for Fillmore, a dictionary must specify thecase potential of words.
For example, in the sentences(1)(2)a) John hit the ball with a bat.b) The bat hit the ball.c) John hit the window with the ball.d) *John hit the window with the ball with the bat.e) *The window hit.a) John broke the window with the ball.b) The ball broke the window.c) The window broke.d) The ball broke the window.bodl hit and broke can have agents as subject.
Notice also that in the caseof hit the object always remains after the verb, but broke allows theobject to be the subject.
Both verbs allow the instrument to be the sub-ject.
And all of this information comes under "syntactic potential.
"Fillmore's current (C. J. FILLMORE, 1970) " cases " are agent, expe-riencer, instrument object, source, goal, place, time, and extent.
Thesyntactic potential of a word (in the sense of AVa~SJAN et al, 1969) de-termines the case of a lexical item (and the case frame of a verb).
Forexample, in the sentences308 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELL(3) a) *Personally, I'm sixty-five.b) Personally, I'm happy.the reason for the non-bizarreness of (b) is that the subject of be happymust be an "experiencer ".
On the other hand the verbal be warm canhave an experiencer, object, instrument, place, or time as its subject:(4) a) Algernon is warm.b) The rock is warm.c) The coat is warm.d) Texas is warm.e) Summers are warm.In particular, C. J. FrrtMOm~ (1969, p. 109) feels that the lexicon mustmake accessible to the user(i) the nature of the deep-structure syntactic environments intowhich the item may be inserted;(ii) the properties of the item to which the rules of grammar aresensitive;(iii) for an item that can be used as a " predicate ", the number'of " arguments " that it conceptually requires;(iv) the role(s) which each argument plays in the situation whichthe item, as predicate, can be used to indicate;(v) the presuppositions or "happiness conditions" for the use ofthe item, the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the item to beused " apdy ";(vi) the nature of the conceptual or morphological relatedness ofthe item to other items in the lexicon;(vii) its meaning; and(viii) the phonological or orthographic shapes which the item as-sumes under given grammatical conditions.Although dictionaries are the most popular way to define words,there are other ways than dictionaries for specifying the meanings 2of  a word within a certain lexical system.
For example, U. WmNP, r~CH~(1963), in his review of Soviet semantic research, speaks of  three ways?
of  specifying word-meanings:It should be clear that we are not using the term ' me.aning' and ' def init ion'synonomously.AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 3091) by lexicographic definition (like the dictionary);2) by locating the lexical item in a synonym system;3) by establishing the syntactic properties of the lexical items.Point (1) has been discussed above.
As for point (2) M. MINSKY (1968)has a few interesting comments on the possibility of constructing a the-saurus-like dictionary (which would be, in effect, a synonym dictionary):My thesis is simply that we must not try to evade the' thesaurus prob-lem' just because we (rightly) can never be satisfied with any particularthesaurus.
We must still learn how to build them, and find ways to makemachines first to use them, then to modify them, and eventually to buildfor themselves new and better ones (p. 27).There has been much recent research in current linguistic theorywith respect o Weinreich's third way of analyzing a terminologicalsystem, by syntactic haracterization f words.
The J. FreEDMAN (1971)computerized lexicon included information about the types of transfor-mations that a word can undergo as well as some rudimentary semanticinformation (in the form of features).
Other information that has notbeen included in computerized systems to any great extent are such no-tions as "factivity " (as defined by P. IfivARSKY and C. KIPARSKY, 1970)and notions of "genericity " and "specificity " (as discussed in R.JACK~NDOrF, 1973).
Another important syntactic development that hasfound its way into lexical systems is "case structure" as mentionedearlier and as elaborated in C. J. FILLMO~ (1968, 1969, 1971), R. P.STOCKW~LL et al (1973).
Most of these interesting and important factsof language have not been incorporated into computerized or standarddictionaries.An additional type of information to be included in a lexicon shouldbe the non-discrete syntactic and semantic features proposed by Rossand by Lakoff.
Both linguists, working in syntax and semantics, re-spectively, have discovered variable acceptability of syntactic and se-mantic features within a given structure.
Lakoffproposes to account forthis variable strength probabilistically, basing his research on resultsfrom the theory of fuzzy sets.
In our work on interactive lexiconconstruction, we have found a variation in responses due, we presumed,to regional, social, psychological nd perhaps chronological differences.This probabilistic information, measured in response time, should alsobe included in a lexicon as information pertinent o utterance under-standing and production.310 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL3.
CONTENTS OF THE LEXICONThe purpose of this section is to describe in specific detail what ourdictionary will look like and how we plan to incorporate the data dis-cussed in the previous section.First, we propose to tag the following syntactico-semantic informa-tion on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs which we assume to becrucial: for every lexical entry in each part of speech we will record:1) Entry word.2) Part of speech.3) Semantic field.4) Dictionary definition.5) Irregular inflectional morphology.6 )  Derivational morphology.
(Prefixed forms are relatively easilyretrievable from the hyphenated form of the word in the dic-tionary with a table of prefixes.
Suffixed forms can be retrievedfor productive suffixes by checking the ending against a list ofsuffmes including the combining forms recorded in Webster's.The purpose of this will in part be to be able to relate lexicalentries from the same root.
)7) Synonyms including synonymous cross-references (availablefrom NIH research group) plus annotations from synonym par-agraphs in the Webster's Dictionary.
Suffixed forms are retrievablein part from run-on entries with notation as to source and tar-get parts of speech.8) Antonyms when available.
(1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are available direcdy from Webster's: 4 and 6are available in part from the derived data sets from the Lexicog-raphy Project users group.
)9) Example of use for each definition under a traditional main entryavailable from the Brown English Corpus.10) Response time for sentences by informant and averaged by sen-tence over all informants.11) Informant data, available from informant, including region, class,sex, age, race and economic status.In addition we will record information peculiar to each part of speech:For nouns (t ?
be derived from defining formula whenever possible,otherwise interactively and by hand):AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 3111) The following syntactico-semantic features:4- human, 4- animate, :k count, 4- concrete, 4- male, 4- female.Also, the following non-binary features which could be treated asa property list or as a set of functions in the" sense of S. MARX (1972) :used as an instrument, indication of quantity or degree, movable, pro-longed, separable, color, and shape.
These were posited on the basisof the defining formulae in Webster's.2) Case markings.3) Metaphorical extension.
(We may find that this category, aswell as others, are probably derivable from other information, but atthe moment it isn't clear and so this information is being listed sepa-rately.
)4) Sociolinguistic restrictions on use of the entry.For verbs:1) Complementizers.2) Subcategorization.3) Defining verb, that is, the verb, if present, used in definingthe entry, e.g.
be, become, come, have, make, etc.
These may be relatableto McCawley's interpretation of kill as " to  cause to become not alive, "and to our notion of semantic field discussed below.4) Selectional features related to noun features such as animatesubject.5) Presuppositions and their differences from synonyms o f  theentry.6) Case structure ,(number and type of arguments.
)For adverbs:1) Type: time, manner, location, direction, degree.
(Much of this can be gotten from the defining formulae.
)2) Position sensitivity: subject-oriented, speaker-oriented, verb-oriented, or sentence-oriented.For adjectives:1) The kind of noun it can or must modify, e.g.
animate, con-crete, count; and the manner in which it modifies (e.g.
warm stove,warm coat) and whether it is a relative term (hot/cold) or absolute (black/white).2) Semantic properties/functions: color, time, location, size, andquality.
(These are disjunct sets.

METHODOLOGYThe plan for the dictionary is to produce a core English lexicon con-sisting of the 20,000 most frequent words listed in H. KU~ERA andW.
N. FRANCIS (1967).
The reason for choosing these is that in theorythey account for 98 ~o of the words in running text.As described in section 3 we havea very good idea of what to includein the lexicon, although this must obviously be left open-ended.
Thereare problems of division of labor, however: that is, how can we mostefficiently capture the information that we want to include.
We havenarrowed the various possible ways down to three:1) by hand (including a real time text editing scheme)2) interactively3) by automated processing of a standard ictionary.
: Method (1) is obvious.
As for method (2) Olney (J. OLNEY, D.RAMSEY, 1973, p. 16) says, " what better source than the disambiguatedparsed \[= formatted\] transcripts of W 7 and MPD \[The MerriamPocket Dictionary, which is also on tape\] is there likely to be in the nearfuture for obtaining semantic data pertaining to the English vocabularyas a whole?
".
We feel that there is a better source, at least for the kindsof information that we are interested in, and that is the native speakerof English.
lk.
N. SMITH (1972) describes a way of obtaining this data314 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELLinteractively (in a system which has been described by R. L. WmMANN(1972, p. 9) as " one of the most successful projects currently underway ") and the reader should consult hat work for details.As to method (3) we have been influenced by the work of one of thelargest groups and one of the most potentially successful groups involvedin automating the process of lexicon construction from standard ic-tionaries, viz., the user's group emanating from the LexicographicProject headed by JoaN OI.NtY of the Institute of Library Research atthe University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Sys-tems Development Corporation.
This project began in July 1966 withthe initiation of transcribing Merriam-Webster's Seventh CollegiateDictionary in computer processable form.
Since then collaboration withover 30 researchers at various institutions has led to the creation ofapproximately 50 data sets derived from the dictionary transcript.
Afew of the data sets have been used in disambiguating the entries in thedictionary - the principal first goal of this philosophically, rather thanlinguistically, oriented project.
Some of this has been relatively success-ful but based on the scope and the methods used, it is clear that still agreat deal more time and effort will have to be expended.Some of the already existent derived data sets are useful.
The groupat SDC has formatted the original transcript of Webster's Seventh sothat the main entry, the etymology, the pronunciation, etc.
are all putinto a fixed format of card image records where the first character ofeach record specifies the type of information recorded, e.g.
whetherthe record is one of the words used in the definition of a main entry.All of the subsequent data sets have been derived from this formattedversion.
One of these is an alphabetized list of the first 86 characters ofall definitions eparately and by part of speech.
In addition all syn-onomous cross-references have been extracted, alphabetized on the mainentry form and on the word referred to.
Also, there are various suffixaldata sets used in aiding to correlate suffmes with definitions.Samples of print-out for sorted definitions within part of speechand end-alphabetized within part of speech are appended.
The formerhas been especially productive by giving us quite a good deal of insightinto so-called defining formulae and these defining formulae have inturn allowed us to posit certain features which can be extracted irectlyfrom the definitions.
These defining formulae will be used in extractingsome of the features from Webster's.
(Some features uch as" + human"cannot be extracted automatically, except by listing, by the interactivescheme described above or, by some inferential scheme.)
We have alsoAN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 315constructed a xwIc concordance for a portion of the data on non-func-tion words in the definitions which will lead to short-cuts for syntac-tic-semantic tagging.5.
STRUCTURING THE DATAThe innovation that we propose to implement in this computerizeddictionary that will allow us to structure and store all of the informationdiscussed above fficiently and accurately is that of the "semantic field.
"The theory of semantic fields is not new; what is new is the use of thisconcept o structure semantic information.
Its most appealing char-acteristic is that it eliminates the need for redundant information (theproblem with the feature approach which is widely used) and it makesretrieval much more efficient.
First we will discuss the motivation forsuch a system as a model for semantic structure.Some of the most interesting empirical evidence for semantic fieldshas been in work done by Marshall and Newcombe in psycholinguisticsand by Whitaker, Kehoe, Schnitzer and others in neuro-linguistics.H.
A. WmTAKER (1971) has described the remarkable correspondenceof the distinct cellular arrays in the cortex of the brain to the classicaldivisions of the language system: the semantic/syntactic component,the lexicon, and the phonological component.For example, it has been found that the lexicon has an existence apartfrom the syntactic-semantic (or logical) aspects of language.
A casestudy reported by H. A. WHITAKER (1971), described a woman whowas unable "to  initiate conversation r to demonstrate g neral cognitiveskills - in brief, the semantic and syntactic aspects of language were to-tally lost.
She was however, able to repeat verbal material well, ... "(p. 190).
Whitaker has postulated that the lexicon is a separate neuralcomponent, perhaps biochemically coded in nerve cells.
That the lex-icon, a separate component, is organized in some sort of semanticfield arrangement was pointed out again and again by Whitaker.
Inwork done by E. WEIGL and M. BIERWISCH (1970), they described er-rors which were the results of substitutions of words for other wordsfrom the same semantic fields; e.g., trousers for blouse, tie for cuff, bodicefor cardigan, sandals for socks, peaches for oranges, bananas for figs, pota-toes for vegetables.
Of particular note is that the substitutions usuallyoccur at the .same taxonomic level, that is, the substitution is rarely an316 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELLitem for the name of the field containing the item (e.g., peaches forfruit).In another study, by H. GOODGLASS, \]3.
KLEIN, P. CAREY and K.JoN~s (1966), the investigators chose words which came within the cat-egories of objects, forms, letters, actions, numbers, colors, and bodyparts.
They found that the patients had an easier time understandingobject names than producing them, but producing letters was easierfor them than understanding them.J.
C. MARSrr~t.
and F. NEWCOMBE (1966) reported errors such as thefollowing: their patient read liberty as freedom, canary as parrot, abroadas  overseas, entertain as entertainment, political as politician and beg asbeggar.
Later studies of the same patient showed that the patient hadtwice as much difficulty with verbs than with nouns and that adjectiveswere harder than nouns but easier than verbs.
One of the problemsencountered was the patient's tendency to read verbs as the correspond-ing derived nominal and to read nominals derived from adjectives asthe original base form of the adjective.
Words like uncle, priest and poetwere harder than horse, lion, and insect.
Large was read as long, short assmall, tall as long, little, as short.H.
A. WraTAgra (1971) reports patients who read verbs as their cor-responding derived nominal form: decide is read as decision, conceal asconcealment, ominate as nomination, portray as portrait, bathe as bath, speakas discussion, remember as memory.
Whitaker also reports that the oppositephenomenon has been found where derived forms are read as their baseforms: refusal was read as refuse, darkness as dark, whiteness as white,amazement as amaze.Psycholinguistic and anthropological data therefore point to thereality of organization i to semantic fiekts and success of informationretrieval schemes has often been tied into a division of the semanticuniverse into fields.
It would seem not only an obvious desideratum buta sine qua non in a dictionary to include information of semantic field.Once the data has been recorded so that all words are completelydefined we will eliminate redundant information so that storing of thelexicon can be accomplished most economically.
The elimination ofredundancy will be done by means of structuring the data in a specificway.
This method has been discussed in E. MAXWEL~ (t973).In effect what happens i this: the head of a semanticfield (call itL) is defined in a certain way; the members of that semantic field (xl,z~ ...x,) are defined in relation to L. All the information that need bespecified to define, zl, etc.
is that information that is unique to them.AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 317For example, there is the semantic field (described in C.J.
FmLMO~,1971) made up of the verbs: judge, accuse, blame, scold, forgive, etc.
Allof the verbs are verbs of judging (which is the name of the semanticfled.)
They are uniquely defined in terms of their presuppositions (i.e.accuse presupposes that the action done is bad)..Therefore, by definingjudge and by saying that accuse, etc.
are kinds of judging except for theirpresuppositions all redundant information can be deleted and the spe-cific definitions can be derived with inferential schemata.An example of how the information would be stored is thefollowing (using the word boil):\[(***) (***) xx (***) (A) (***) (A) (***)\]SF AGENT OBJECT PLACE INSTR.
(' COOK ') (HUMAN) (EDIBLE/POTABLE) (HEATED) (WATER.
)The partial description of the word boil gives the following infor-mation: that it is a member of the semantic field "cook "; that the agentmust be a member of the semantic field" human"; that the thing boiledmust be edible or potable; that the place the boiling is done must beheated (actually this information is redundant since the place for cook-ing must also be heated); and the instrument in which the boiling isdone must be water.
The symbol xx means that the object can be sub-ject if no agent is stated:Alice boiled the eggs.The eggs boiled quickly.The parentheses around the operators mean that the choice of placeand instrument is optional.Using this model we can state relationships between derivationalmorphemes and nominalizations that have not as yet been stated incomputerized lexicons.
(Reliable is passively related to rely: "able tobe relied on "; while comfortable is actively related to comfort: "able tocomfort ").SUMMARY.
Our purpose is to construct a 20,000 word core dic-tionary of English to be used in computerized natural anguage usingsystems.
It is to include as much syntactico-semantic information asnecessary to be used in most current heoretical frameworks both in318 RAOUL N.
