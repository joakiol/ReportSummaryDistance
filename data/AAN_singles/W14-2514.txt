We perform thisstudy on the US presidential debates andshow that a candidate?s power, modeledafter their poll scores, affects how oftenhe/she attempts to shift topics and whetherhe/she succeeds.
We ensure the validityof topic shifts by confirming, through asimple but effective method, that the turnsthat shift topics provide substantive topi-cal content to the interaction.
