Meanwhile, the structure of theKazakh basic phrases were analyzed; and the determination of the Kazakh basic phrases collocation andextraction of the Kazakh basic phrases based on rules were followed.
The Maximum Entropy (ME)model uses for the identification of the phrases from texts and achieved a result of automatic identifica-tion of Kazakh phrases with an accuracy of 78.22% based on rules System and additional artificial mod-ification.
Design feature of this ME model join rely on templates of Kazakh Word, part of speech, affix-es.
Experimental results show that the accuracy rate reached 87.89?
?1 IntroductionAutomatic phrase identification is an important task in natural language processing.
A phrase is agroup of words that work together.
Phrase recognition is a grammatical unit agent between words andsentences in natural language processing.
Phrase identification Parser has been developed for differentlanguages, for example, the Church's Base NP Recognition for English (Church, 1988).
The rule-basedModel and Maximum Entropy Model (ME) are the most commonly used technology for phrase repre-sentation and parsing.Kazakh Language belongs to the Turkish Language group in the Altaic language family.
It is an agglu-tinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational or inflectional affixes to rootwords.
Phrase identification is also an indispensable part for Kazakh information processing.
In thepast a few year, we have put forward methods for Kazakh morphological analysis, which includesstem extraction, part of speech(POS) tagging, spelling check, etc.
Recently, we are working on syntaxparsing, analysis of phrase structure, automatic identification of phrase and in-depth analysis of sen-tence structure.Kazakh phrases are syntactic units consisting of two or more than two words.
The phrases can be clas-sified into two categories, which are free phrase and fixed phrase.
We are exploring methods whichare more suitable for shallow syntactic parsing of Kazakh according to the nature of Kazakh language.The research includes a systematic study on information regularity and disambiguation of the Kazakhphrase, and automatic recognition of basic phrases of Kazakh language.
We have developed a rule-based method for the automatic recognition of Kazakh basic phrases, and automatic identification ofverb phrase, noun phrase and adjective phrase based on maximum entropy in Kazakh language at thesame time.
Moreover, the ambiguity of structures is also resolved based on rules.This study solves the problem of Kazakh phrase recognition by providing some effective methods.This sets up a basis for further syntactic process and tree bank building.
This research also provides away to build database for various fields like knowledge acquisition, syntactic understanding, Chinese-Kazakh machine translation, the process of large-scale corpus, etc.This work is lice ced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Place licence.

This is achieved by using rulesare ME method.2 Related workThere are a variety of techniques used for phrase recognition, which include rule-based technique, sta-tistical technique, and a combination of them.
Church's (1988) approach used manual or semi-automatic annotation phrase corpus as a training corpus.
Another popular method is to use a Chunkparsing for statistics model to determine the boundary (Koeling, 2000).
Chunk parsing was first intro-duced by Abney (1991), which is one of the most widely used syntactic parsing methods.
The mainidea of chunk parsing lies in seeking the appropriate breakthrough point, and decomposing the fullparsing problems into a syntax topology statistical structure and syntactic relations.
Zhao and Huang(1998) are pioneers in Chinese phrase studies; Tsinghua University had also completed its TCT(Tsinghua Chinese Treebank) for Chinese (Zhou, 2004).
The method has been also applied into studiesof other languages, such as Kazakh Base NP recognition (Altenbek et al, 2009), and Uyghur Base VPRecognition by CRF (Mamatmin et al, 2012).Maximum Entropy was first introduced to NLP area by Berger et al (1996) and Della Pietra et al.(1997).
Maximum Entropy is an extremely flexible technique for linguistic modelling.
It can use a vir-tually unrestricted and rich feature set in the framework of a probability model.
It is a conditional, dis-criminative model and allows mutually dependent variables (Ratnaparkhi, 1999).3 Kazakh Phase Parsing3.1 Kazakh MorphologyMorphological analysis is an important task in natural language processing research.
It was developedfor different languages, included English  (Porter, 1980), Finnish  (Karttunen, 1983), Turkish  (Oflaz-er, 1994; G?l?en, 2004), and Arabic (Beesley, 1996).Comparing with other languages, the Kazakh morphological system uses a large number of suffixesand a small number of prefixes.
Every word has a root, or a stem (Milat, 2003;Zhang 2004).
The basicKazakh phrase is an adjacent and non-nested phrase which does not contain recursive structure.3.2 The Categories of Kazakh PhraseParsing is one of the most basic and fundamental components in natural language processing.
Chunkparsing intends to obtain a fragment without thinking deeply.A Kazakh phrase is composed of two or more than two words which connected with meaning andgrammatical structure.
There is only a core word in a Kazakh phrase.
In the case of Kazakh, Kazakhphrases can be divided into fixed phrases and temporary phrases by the meanings of the phrases.Abney propose the first complete description of lexical chunks system.
In this study the basic phrasechunks base was found according to Abney?s system.
The five most common phrase in Kazakh areNO.
Category Explanation Example (Kazakh) Example (English?1 NP noun phrase  The golden autumn2 VP verb phrase  Achieve dreams3 ADJP adjective phrase  Very clean4 NUMP Numeral phrases  Eight & nine thousand5 ADVP Adverb phrase  The front ofTable 1.
Part of Kazakh phrase categories.1008noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, Numeral phrases, Adverb phrase as shown in table 1.Kazakh language is rich in the external morphology which shows prominent in phrase structure.3.3 The Basic Kazakh phrase mark specificationBasic Kazakh phrase marks both its own attribute, for example part of speech, stems and affixes, andtypes of phrase.
We used IOB Tagging to mark the start and end of chunks.Basic Kazakh phrase start of chunks Inner tag of chunks Out tag of chunksnoun phrase B-NP I-NPOverb phrase B-VP I-VPadjective phrase B-ADJP I-ADJPAdverb phrases B-ADVP I-ADVPNumeral phrase B-NUMP I-NUMPTable 2.
The Basic Kazakh phrase IOB Tagging.4 Statistics and Analysis of Kazakh Phrase StructureReferring to modern Kazakh grammar (Milat, 2003; Dingjing Zhong.
2004), the basic rules of phrasestructure of Kazakh language was summarized.
The phrase structures are extracted from the corpus,and a set of rules are created based on it as well.In the representation of basic phrase structures, the following part of speech tagging symbols are usedin XML documents of Kazakh corpus: v (verb), n. (noun), adj.
(adjective), num.
(number), adv.
(ad-verb), pron.
(pronoun), ono.
(onomatopoeia), int.
(interjections), conj.
(conjunction), part.
(partical).The Kazakh phrases Structure divided by the function of phrases in our system are shown below.Kazakh verb phrase structure:1) n+v;   2) v+v;   3) adv+v;  4) adj+v;  5) v+adv;  6) v+v+v;  7) pron+v; 8) n+part+v; 9) n+conj+v;10) ono+v; 11) int+v; 12) v+part+v; 13)v+part; 14) v+conj+v;  15)pron+part+v.Kazakh noun phrase structure:1) n+n; 2) n+conj+n; 3) pron+conj+pron; 4) pron+n; 5) adj+conj+adj; 6) adj+n; 7) adj+adv+n;8) num+n; 9) v+n; 10) [ ]+n.Kazakh adjective phrase structure:1) adj+n; 2) adj+v; 3) adj+n+v; 4) pron+adj; 5) adv+adj+n; 6) adj+adj+n; 7) num+adv+n;Collocations, like v+adv, n+part+v, pron+adv, v+part+v, v+part, also exist in other phrase except verbphrase.
These conditions easily cause ambiguity.5 Rule-based phrase taggingKazakh language has two characteristics that have to be taken into account: agglutinative morphologyand rather free word order with explicit case marking.The corpus we used in this process has been already segmented.
The way we extracted stem and affixwas briefly mentioned in the paper.
In this paper we used the segmented results of early work, as it isnot the core part of the algorithm.Input: word segmentation (extraction stem and affix) and POS tagged corpus (test.xml);Output: First: Phrase tagged file; Second: Phrase file;Based on the basic rules of phrase, we have done extraction of phrases from POS tagged Kazakh cor-pus.
The extraction process is as follows:(a) First roughly segmented XML corpus.
The common segmentation marks include semicolon, com-ma, full stop, exclamation mark, question mark.
(b) For the segmented data, we extract the three elements of basic phrase: part of speech (POS), affix,and the word.1009(c) Look for the matched rule in the rule set.
If found, save the basic phrase.
Otherwise go back step 1.According to combination rules of basic Kazakh phrase, basic phrase was extracted from corpus andmodified by manual work.
The correct combination of basic Kazakh phrase was marked.6 Analysis of Kazakh phrase structure ambiguityAmbiguity computer analysis of language structure has been one of the difficulties problems.
This ar-ticle from the delimitation ambiguity and structural relationship is to study two aspects of phrase struc-ture ambiguity.One of the difficulties in Kazakh phrase research is the phrase disambiguation problem.
Ambiguousreasons is word POS ambiguity, phrase boundaries is not easy to determine, POS with the same se-quence, E.g.
there are five  ambiguous forms:(1) VD form (v + adv )Eg.1a?
is verb phrase.
(Admission to reduce)Eg.1b?
is adverb phrase.
( Admission to more than)(2) ND for (n+adv, pron+adv)Eg.2a?
is verb phrase.
( Change a new clothes)Eg.2b?
is adverb phrase.
( Good record)(3) NPV form?
n+part+v,  pron+part+v)Eg.3a?
is verb phrase.
( Learn about unity)Eg.3b?
is noun phrase.
( only Ashan)(4) VPV form (v+part+v)Eg.4a?
is verb phrase.
( came then left)Eg.4b?
is adverb phrase.
(Relevant research to understand)(5) VP form (v+part)Eg.5a?
is verb phrase.
( Speaking before)Eg.5b?
is verb phrase.
( Organize the relevant)For these ambiguities, we can't simply use the rules to match ways to eliminate, but rather to use max-imum entropy model to solve the problem.7 Kazakh Phrase Identification based Maximum Entropy ModelMaximum Entropy Model is an effective machine learning model which is proposed to solve the POStagging problem, it using ME model is the ability to incorporate various features into the conditionalprobability.
The Kazakh phrase recognition task is presented as follow.The entropy model P:    ???

Such a model can be shown to have the following form:)(maxarg* pHp Cp??
(2)Goal: select a distribution p from a set of allowed distributions that maximizes H(y|X).7.1 Feature definedKazakh language is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by adding derivational,inflectional affixes or suffixes to root words.
The features include words, part of speech (POS), inflec-tional affixes of the training corpus.
It seems that the features are na?ve.
However, these three kinds offeatures are the most important components of Kazakh language, and they reflect the characteristic ofKazakh language.According to its own characteristics of a Kazakh, this feature space is defined as follows:(1) the word, including the current word, the previous word and next word.1010(2) part of speech(POS), including the part-of-speech types of the current word, previous word andnext word.
(3) Affix ingredients, including the current word and the word about the additional ingredient info-mation.
(4) Phrase tag that contains the current word and the words to the right and the left two words Phrasemarker.This rule-based approach was applied to generate the maximum entropy model training corpus.
Basedon Kazakh linguistics, the atomic feature space is as shown in table 3.Feature tag Feature explanation Feature tag Feature explanationW(-1)previous one word POS (-2)POS (-1)POS of previous two word and POSof previous one wordW(0)the current word POS (-1)POS (0)POS of previous one word and POSof the current wordW(+1)next one word POS (0)POS (+1)POS of the current word and POS ofnext one wordW(-1)W(0)previous one wordand the current wordPOS (+1)POS (+2)POS of next one word and POS ofnext two wordW(0)W(+1)the current word andnext one wordPOS (-2?POS (-1)POS (0)POS of previous two word and POSof previous one word and POS of thecurrent wordW(-1)W(0?W(+1)previous one wordand the current wordand next one wordPOS (-1)POS (0)POS (+1)POS of previous one word and POSof the current word and POS of nextone wordPOS (-2)POS of previous twowordPOS (0)POS (+1)POS (+2)POS of the current word and POS ofnext one word and POS of next twowordPOS (-1)POS of previous onewordAffix(-1)affix of previous wordPOS (0?POS of the currentwordAffix(0)affix of current wordPOS (+1) POS of next one word Affix(1) affix of next one wordPOS (+2) POS of next two wordTable 3.
Atomic feature templates.7.2  Feature selectionBasic phrases with statistical model recognition need to select a high correlation, and the Kazakh lan-guage features to train with good effect.
Establish model based on rule of the language, this work se-lected feature through templates.
After several rounds of experimental debugging, then used artificialselection, twenty one templates were selected for Kazakh verb  phrase, only considered important fea-tures.
According to each one?s feature, templates were defined as follow.No.
template No.

Combined  feature of Kz Base VP.In order to get the best template, this work structured and processed six template based on Table 4.1011Each information function valued in the context of current word, combine the various function valuesinto the premise of features, got the characteristics of the movement through the word tag, then it canextract features.Template A: [RRPos, RRVP, RWord, RAffix, RPos, RVP, CPos, CVP, CWord, CAffix, LLPos,LLVP, LWord, LAffix, LPos, LVP] Observation of effects of all the words in the feature space on theresult of the experiment.Template B: [CPos, CVP, CWord, CAffix, LLPos, LLVP, LWord, LAffix, LPos, LVP] Observation ofeffects of left side two words of the candidate word on the result of the experiment.Template C:[ RRPos?RRVP?RWord?RAffix?RPos?RVP?CPos?CVP?CWord,CAffix] Ob-servation of effects of right side two words of the candidate word on the result of the experiment.Template D:[ RWord?RAffix?RPos?RVP?CPos?CVP?CWord,CAffix?

It shows that the C and F template give us the most highest result, namely thetwo words on the right have the biggest influence to the result.
It proves Kazakh verb phrases arecommonly at the end of the sentence.7.3    General threshold selectionThere are two general feature selection methods: incremental feature selection and feature selection ofbased on frequency threshold.
The frequency is greater than a threshold value equal to a characteristic.Through repeating them many times, the frequency threshold value was characterized k = 5, character-ized in that the use of the frequency characteristic is greater than 5.8 Kazakh Phrase Recognition SystemKazakh phrase recognition system, which based on Maximum Entropy Model, consists of four mod-ules, namely, pre-processing module, training module, Feature selection module, identification mod-ule.

Phrase recognition test.10 ConclusionThis paper provided solution for identifying Kazakh basic phrases.
We have tried rule-based and themaximum entropy methods.
The Kazakh words, part of speech, affixes context information are used todesign template of features for maximum entropy model.
Based on statistical methods, higher accura-cy could be obtained in the test, but it was requires more training data.The recognition of basic Kazakh phrase could simplify sentence structure, reduce the difficulty of syn-tactic analyzer.
This work put maximum entropy model into recognition of basic Kazakh phrase.However, there are still space for improvement on scale and accuracy rate comparing to English andChinese.
In the future, our work will focus on completing of corpus and other models.AcknowledgmentsThis work is funded by the Natural Science Foundation of P.R.
