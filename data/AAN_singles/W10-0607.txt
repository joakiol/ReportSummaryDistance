Among the factors that may play arole in acquisition, in this paper we investigatethe influence of polysemy.
We examine dataobtained from psycholinguistic action namingtasks performed by children and adults(speakers of Brazilian Portuguese), and ana-lyze some characteristics of the verbs used byeach group in terms of similarity of content,using Jaccard?s coefficient, and of topology,using graph theory.
The experiments suggestthat younger children tend to use more poly-semic verbs than adults to describe events inthe world.1 IntroductionLexical acquisition is restrained by perception andcomprehension difficulties, which are associatedwith a number of linguistic and psycholinguisticfactors.
Among these we can cite age of acquis i-tion (Ellis and Morrison, 1998; Ellis and Ralph,2000), frequency (Morrison and Ellis, 1995) , syn-tactic (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al, 2004; Goldberg,1999; Thompson et.
al, 2003) and semantic (Bree-din et.
al, 1998; Barde et al, 2006) characteristicsof words.
In terms of semantic features, acquisitionmay be influenced by the polysemy and generalityof a word, among others.In terms of semantic features, acquisition maybe influenced by the generality and polysemy of aword, among others.
For instance, consideringacquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999)observes that verbs such as go, put and give areamong those to be acquired first, for they are moregeneral and frequent, and have lower ?semanticweight?
(a relative measure of complexity; Breedinet.
al, 1998; Barde et al, 2006).
These verbs,known as light verbs, not only are acquired first:they are also known to be more easily used byaphasics (Breedin et al, 1998; Thompson, 2003;Thompson et al 2003; Barde et al 2006; but seeKim and Thompson, 2004), which suggest theirgreat importance for human cognition.
The prefe-rence for light verbs may be explained by the moregeneral meanings they tend to present and theirmore polysemic nature, that is their ability to con-vey multiple meanings, since the more polysemicthe verb is, the more contexts in which it can beused (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al,2006).
The importance of the number of relation-ships a word has in the learning environment hasbeen pointed out by Hills et al (2009), regardlessof generality.
Several factors may influence acqui-sition, but in this paper we will focus on polysemy.Understanding how characteristics like polyse-my influence acquisition is essential for the con-struction of more precise theories.
Therefore, thehypothesis we investigate is that more polysemouswords have a higher chance of earlier acquisition.For this purpose, we compare data from childrenand adults from the same linguistic community,native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, in an ac-tion naming task, looking at lexical evolution byusing statistical and topological analysis of the datamodeled as graphs (following Steyvers and Tenen-baum, 2005, and Gorman and Curran, 2007).
Thisapproach innovates in the sense that it directlysimulates the influence of a linguistic factor overthe process of lexical evolution.52This paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 de-scribes relevant work on computational modelingof language acquisition.
Section 3 presents thematerials and methods employed in the exper i-ments of the present work.
Sections 4 and 5 presentthe results, and section 6 concludes and presentsfuture work.2 Related WorkIn recent years, there has been growing interest inthe investigation of language acquisition usingcomputational models.
For instance, some workhas investigated language properties such as age-of-acquisition effects (Ellis and Ralph, 2000; Li etal., 2004).
Others have simulated aspects of theacquisition process (Siskind, 1996; Yu, 2005; Yu,2006; Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007; Fazly et al 2008)and lexical growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum,2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007).Some authors employ graph theory metrics todirectly analyze word senses (Sinha and Mihalcea,2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007).
In this paper,word senses are implicitly expressed by graphedges, thus being considered indirectly.
Graphtheory has also been successfully used in moretheoretical fields, like the characterization andcomparison of languages (Motter et al, 2002; Fer-rer-i-Cancho et al, 2004; Masucci and Rodgers,2006).
For example, the works by Sigman andCecchi (2002), and Gorman and Curran (2007) usegraph measures to extensively analyze WordNetproperties.
Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) usesome properties of language networks to propose amodel of semantic growth, which is compatiblewith the effects of learning history variables, suchas age of acquisition and frequency, in semanticprocessing tasks.
The approach proposed  in thiswork follows Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), andGorman and Curran (2007) in the sense of iterativemodifications of graphs, but differs in method (weuse involutions instead of evolutions) and objec-tive: modifications are motivated by the study ofpolysemy instead of production of a given topolog-ical arrangement.
It also follows Deyne and Storms(2008), in the sense that it directly relates linguisticfactors and graph theory metrics, and Coronges etal.
(2007), in the sense that it compares networksof different populations with the given approach.As to Brazilian Portuguese, in particular, Anti-queira et al (2007) relate graph theory metrics andtext quality measurement, while Soares et al(2005)report on a phonetic study.
Tonietto et al (2008)analyze the influence of pragmatic aspects, such asconventionality of use, over the lexical organiza-tion of verbs, and observe that adults tend to prefermore conventional labels than children.In this context, this study follows Tonietto et al(2008) in using data from a psycholinguistic actionnaming task.
However, the analysis is done interms of lexical evolution, by using graph and settheory metrics (explained below) to understand theinfluence of some linguistic characteristics ofwords, especially polysemy.3 Materials and Methods3.1 The DataThis paper investigates the lexical evolution ofverbs by using data from an action naming taskperformed by different age groups: 55 children and55 young adults.
In order to study the evolution ofthe lexicon in children, children?s data are longitu-dinal; participants of the first data collection (G1)aged between 2;0 and 3;11 (average 3;1), and inthe second collection (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6(average 5;5) as described by Tonietto et al(2008).
The adult group is unrelated to the child-ren, and aged between 17;0 and 34;0 (average21;8).
The longitudinal data enabled the compari-son across the lexical evolution of children at ageof acquisition (G1), two years later (G2), and thereference group of adults (G3).
Participants wereshown 17 actions of destruction or division (To-nietto et al 2008); answers were preprocessed inorder to eliminate both invalid answers (like ?Idon't know?)
and answers with only 1 occurrenceper group.
The selection of this particular domain(destruction and division) is due to its cognitiveimportance: it was found to be one of the four con-ceptual zones, grouping a great amount of verbs1(Tonietto, 2009).There were a total of 935 answers per group, outof which 785, 911 and 917 were valid answers toG1, G2 and G3, respectively.
These made averagesof 46.18, 53.59 and 53.94 valid answers per action,respectively.
The average numbers of distinct validanswers per action, before merging (explained insection 3.2), were 6.76, 5.53 and 4, respectively.1 The others are evasion, excitation, and union.53The answers given by each participant were col-lected and annotated two polysemy scores, eachcalculated from a different source:Wscore is the polysemy score of a verb ac-cording to its number of synsets (synonymsets) in WordNetBR (Dias-da-Silva et al,2000, Maziero, 2008), the Brazilian Portu-guese version of Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998).Hscore is the number of different entries fora verb in the Houaiss dictionary (Houaiss,2007).Information about these two scores for eachgroup is shown in Table 1.G1 G2 G3Average type Wscore 10.55 10.64 10.48Average token Wscore 16.25 14.66 11.13Average type Hscore 21.59 20.84 16.26Average token Hscore 26.93 23.02 17.82Table 1: Score per group and per participant.We notice that most scores, i.e., type and tokenHscores, and token Wscore, decrease as age in-creases, which is compatible with the hypothesisinvestigated.
However, due to the limited coverageof WordNetBR2, some verbs had a null value, andthis is reflected in type Wscore.
This is the case of?serrar?
(to saw) which appears in both G1 andG2, but not in G3.A comparative analysis of linguistic productionacross the different groups is presented in Table 2.There is a significant similarity across the groups,with 12 verbs (out of a total of 44) being commonto all of them.
In each column, the second graph iscompared to the first.
In the ?G1-G2?
column,there are 16 verbs common to both graphs, whichrepresents 64% of the verbs in G2 (with 36% of theverbs in G2 not appearing in G1).
As expected, dueto the proximity in age, results show a higher simi-larity between G1 and G2 than between G2 andG3.2 WordNetBR was still under construction when annotationwas performed.G1-G2 G2-G3 G1-G3 AllCommon verbs 16 17 12 12Verbs only inolder group (%)36 45.16 58.06 -?Table 2: Comparisons between groups3.3.2 Simulation DynamicsLinguistic production of each group wasrepresented in terms of graphs, whose nodesrepresent the verbs mentioned in the task.
Verbsuttered for the same action were assumed to sharesemantic information, thus being related to eachother.
The existence of conceptual relationshipsdue to semantic association is in accordance withNelson et al (1998), where implicit semantic rela-tions were shown to influence on recall and recog-nition.
Therefore, for each age group, all the verbsuttered for a given action were linked together,forming a (clique) subgraph.
The subgraphs for thedifferent actions were then connected in a mergingstep, through the polysemic words uttered for morethan one action.As the goal of this research is to investigatewhether a factor such as polysemy has any influ-ence on language acquisition, we examine the ef-fects of using it to incrementally change thenetwork over time.
Strategies for network modif i-cation, such as network growth (Albert and Ba-rab?si, 2002), have been used to help evaluate theeffects of particular factors by iteratively changingthe network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005;Gorman and Curran, 2007).
Network growth in-crementally adds nodes to an initial state of thenetwork, by means of some criteria, allowing ana l-ysis of its convergence to a final state.
The longi-tudinal data used in this paper provides referencesto both an initial and a final state.
However, due todifferences in vocabulary size and content betweenthe groups, network growth would require com-plete knowledge of the vocabulary of both thesource and target groups to precisely decide on thenodes to include and where.
Network involution,the strategy adopted, works in the opposite waythan network growth.
It takes an older group graphas the source and decides on the nodes to iterative-ly remove, regardless of the younger group graph,and uses the latter only as a reference for compari-3 Relevant comparisons are for G1-G2 and G2-G3 pairs.

Sincegraphs represent vocabularies, by these metrics weaim to analyze vocabulary structure, verifyingwhether it is possible for structures to approximateeach other.
The graphs were measured in relationto the following:?
number of vertices (n),?
number of edges (M),?
average minimal path length (L),?
density (D),?
average node connectivity (k),?
average clustering coefficient (C/s) 4,?
average number of repetitions (r).L assesses structure in the sense of positioning:how far the nodes are from one another.
D and kexpress the relation between number of edges andnumber of nodes in different ways; they are ameasure of edge proportion.
C/s measures the dis-tribution of edges among the nodes, assessing thestructure per se.
The division by the number ofdisconnected subgraphs extends the concept toaccount for partitioning.
Finally, r captures thenumber of different actions for which the sameverb was employed.Although all metrics are useful for analyzing thegraphs, a subset of four was selected to be used inthe involution process: k , D, L and C/s.
With k  andD, we measure semantic share, since that is whatrelations among nodes are supposed to mean (seeabove).
L and C/s are intended to measure vocabu-lary uniformity, since greater distances and lowerclusterization are related to the presence of subcen-ters of meaning (again, taking relations as effect ofsemantic share).In order to compare the contents of each graphas well, we employed a measure of set similarity;in this case, Jaccard?s similarity coefficient (Jac-card, 1901).
With these measures, we analyze howclose vocabularies of each two groups are in re-spect to their content.
Given two sets A and B, theJaccard?s coefficient J can be calculated as fol-lows:4 We adopt the local clustering coefficient of Watts and Stro-gatz (1998), but as the graphs may become disconnectedduring network modification, this value is further divided bythe number of subgraphs.,where ?x?
is the number of elements in both A andB, ?y?
is the number of elements only in A, and?z?
is the number of elements only in B.
For thispurpose, graphs were taken as verb sets, regardlessof their inner relations.To verify the hypothesis that more polysemicverbs are more likely to be acquired, by node eli-mination, verbs were ranked in increasing order ofpolysemy (from less to more polysemic verbs).Therefore, at each step of graph involution, a verbwas selected to be removed, and the resultinggraph was measured.
In case of a tie, verbs withthe same polysemy value were randomly selecteduntil all of them have been removed.
Results arereported in terms of the averages of 10-fold cross-validation.4 ResultsA topological analysis of the graphs is shown inTable 3.
As expected, vocabulary size, representedby n, increases with age, with G1 and G2 beingcloser in age and size than G2 and G3.
A concomi-tant decrease in the average connectivity (k) of thenodes with age suggests vocabulary specialization.This decrease is even more clearly shown by densi-ty (D), since it measures the proportion of edgesagainst the theoretical maximum.
As age increases,so does the average minimal path length (L), withless paths through each node, which leads to amore structured and distributed network.
Speciali-zation is again represented by a decrease in r, theaverage number of actions for which each verb wasmentioned (the more repeatedly it is mentioned,the less specialized the vocabulary tends to be).G1 G2 G3n 22 25 31L 1.46 1.6 1.98D 0.55 0.42 0.27M 128 126 126C/s 0.84 0.78 0.78k?

Jaccard?s coeffi-cient reinforces this result, with a score of 0.52between G1 and G2, and of 0.44 between G2 andG3.Figure 1 shows the graphs for each group, whereprogressive structuring and decentralization can beseen.The effect of polysemy is observed in the pro-portion of verbs with a higher degree: G1 is struc-tured by highly connected verbs (there is a lowproportion of verbs with low degree), while in G3more than 80% of the nodes have a degree of 11 orless (Figure 2).Figure 2.
Cumulative histogram of node degree.5 Simulation ResultsThis research investigates the relation between thenumber of meanings and ease of learning, hypothe-sizing that the more meanings a verb has, the easierit is to be learned, and the earlier children will useit.
Particularly considering graph theory metrics, ifwe remove the verbs with fewer meanings from thegraph of an older group, the overall structure willapproximate to that of a younger group.
Consider-ing set theory metrics, as we remove these verbs,there should be an increase in the similarity be-tween the contents of the graphs.Therefore, the most relevant part of each chart isits initial state.
The verbs to be first removed areexpected to be those that differentiate graphs con-cerning both structure and content.Although the previous results in section 4 sug-gest an influence of polysemy on the lexical organ-ization of verbs, we intend to use involutions toconfirm these tendencies.
Each involution is com-pared to a random counterpart, making the inter-pretation easy.5.1 Network Involution TopologyThe graph theory metrics (k , L, C/s and D) of thecollected data are shown in Figures 3 and 4 interms of 2 lines: network involution with noderemoval (a) by using the selected criterion, and (b)by using random selection (10-fold cross valida-tion).
In addition, each figure also shows the meas-ure for the younger group as reference (a dashed,straight, thick line).In each figure, charts are displayed in four col-umns and two rows.
Each column represents agraph theory metric, and each row refers to the useof a different score.
For example, the first chart ofeach figure is the result of average connectivity (k)in a complete involution, using Wscore.
Each le-gend refers to all eight charts in the figure.The results of the simulations from G2 to G1(Figure 3) show that the four metrics are clearlydistinct from random elimination from the begin-ning, indicating that polysemy plays a role in theprocess.
C/s is particularly distinct from randomelimination: while the former remains constantalmost to the end, indicating a highly structured(clustered) graph, even during node removal, therandom elimination shows effects of graph part i-tioning.
The remaining metrics presented theirgreatest approximations to the reference line beforethe middle of the chart, suggesting that the initialverbs were actually the ones differentiating bothgraphs.
These results suggest an initial increase insemantic share, as the proportion of edges by nodeincreases (k and D), and in uniformity, as nodes getcloser to one another (L) and remain clustered(C/s).56Simulation Random Reference - G2Figure 3.
Network involution from G2 to G1 using two scores for node removal: graph theory metricsFigure 4.
Network involution from G3 to G2 using two scores for node removal: graph theory metricsLooking at the involution charts of G3, taking G2as reference, the same tendencies are maintained,although not as clearly as the previous results (Fig-ure 4).
The greatest approximations between k andD happen in the first half of the chart, but muchcloser to the middle when compared with Figure 3.C/s still behaves steadily, remaining stable duringmost of the simulation, suggesting maintenance ofthe clustered structure.The quasi-random behavior of L can be ex-plained by the initial structure of the graphs.
Theybecome progressively sparser as age increases, butthe difference between G3 and G2 is greater thanbetween G2 and G1 (this was both visually andstatically confirmed).
Therefore, G3 would requiretoo many removals until the most distant nodeswere eliminated, even in an ideal elimination s imu-lation, thus preventing a descent from the begin-ning.
The same can be said about averageconnectivity: since G3 has such a low initial score,and low deviation, even if the nodes with the low-est degrees were eliminated, it would not result in amuch better result.5.2 Network Involution SimilarityThe main metric to analyze set similarity is Jac-card?s coefficient.
There are two important factorsSimulation Random Reference - G1Average connectivity (k)          Average minimal path (L)        Clustering coefficient (C/s )                    Density (D)HscoreWscoreAverage connectivity (k)          Average minimal path (L)        Clustering coefficient (C/s )                    Density (D)HscoreWscore051015Iteration00,511,52Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration051015Iteration00,511,52Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration024681012Iteration00,511,522,5Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration00,20,40,60,8Iteration024681012Iteration00,511,522,5Iteration00,20,40,60,811,2Iteration00,10,20,30,40,5Iteration57influencing it: the number of verbs common toboth sets (the ?x?
component of the formula),?common verbs?
hereby; and the number of verbswhich are exclusive for the older group, the ?dif-ferent verbs?
(the ?z?
component of the formula,where the older group is represented by ?B?).
Inthe charts, a rise means that ?different verbs?
wereeliminated one by one (increasing set similarity),Jaccard?s Coefficient                Excluded VerbsFigure 5.

Network involution from G3 to G2 usingtwo scores for node removal: set theory metrics.and a descent means that ?common verbs?
wereeliminated instead.In addition to Jaccard?s coefficient, we includedthe measures for ?excluded different?
verbs and?excluded common?
verbs (and their random coun-terparts) in percentage.
In this sense, the ?ExcludedDifferent?
line presents the percentage of the ?dif-ferent verbs?
excluded so far, and similarly in the?Excluded Common?
line.
By doing so, it is possi-ble to measure the exact evolution of both setsdespite the proportion between them (there aremuch more ?common?
than ?different?
verbs).
Arise in the ?Excluded Different?
line means thatsets are getting similar, while stabilization (sincedescents are not possible) means that they are get-ting different.
The opposite applies to the ?Ex-cluded Common?
line.
All lines start at 0% andend at 100%.In the figures, charts are arranged in columns(the parameter being measured) and rows (thescore being used).
This time, each legend is partic-ular to each parameter (one to Jaccard?s coefficientand another to the excluded verbs).Both simulation sets (Figures 5 and 6) confirmthe expected pattern: an initial increase in the pro-portion between "different" and "common" verbs.Jaccard?s coefficient behaves more satisfactorily inthe second simulation set (Figure 6), where a sharprise is observed before the middle of the chart, thusindicating that many ?different verbs?
were ex-cluded.
In the first set (Figure 5), Wscore behavesambiguously with two rises: one before and anoth-er after de middle of the chart.
Hscore behaves thesame way, but the second rise is much sharper thanthe first.
Even so, the positive effect of polysemy isclear in the ?Excluded Different?
and ?ExcludedCommon?
lines.
We notice that the ?ExcludedDifferent?
line is usually above the ?ExcludedCommon?
in the beginning and far from the ran-dom values.
Wscore in Figure 5 is an exception,although a significant rise is observed in the begin-ning.5.3 DiscussionResults show that metrics behaved in a consistentmanner, considering the natural variation of differ-ent sources of information.5 Concerning graph5 Since the measures were taken from the whole graph, it wasnot possible to determine a measure of significance withoutother graph configurations to compare to.

Even so,an analysis of the ?Excluded Different?
curvesmade it clear that the results were better than theyappeared to be.6 Conclusions and Future WorkThis study investigated the influence of polysemyon verb acquisition and organization using bothgraph and set theory metrics.
In general, resultsfrom the topological analysis showed a tendencytowards the reference value, and the greatest simi-larities were mostly collected in the beginning, asexpected, pointing for a preference of children touse more polysemous verbs.
The static analysis ofthe initial graphs (Tables 1, 2 and 3) corroboratethe hypothesis.
As a result, we note that not onlydoes the evolution of human vocabulary lead to adecrease in the average polysemy measure, but itsstructure also evolves according to this linguisticfactor.
So we conclude that both the model of invo-lution and the given analysis are appropriate forlinguistic studies concerning vocabulary evolution.The analyses highlighted also some interestingproperties reflected in the graphs, such as vocabu-lary growth and specialization with the increase ofparticipants?
age.
In addition, the analysis wasuseful in showing that the graphs of the two groupsof children were more similar to each other than tothat of adults, both in structure and content.For future work, we intend to apply the sameapproach to other parameters, such as frequency,concreteness, and syntactic complexity.
As theymay simultaneously influence acquisition, we alsoplan to investigate possible combinations of thesefactors.
We also intend to apply this methodologyto investigate lexical dissolution in the context ofpathologies, such as Alzheimer?s disease, and inparisons with random elimination can be seen as a tendency.Additionally, the experiments consist of two simulations, overthree different data sets, by using two different sets of polyse-my, two kinds of metrics, and five different metrics, whichprovide robustness to the results.larger data sets, in order to further confirm theresults obtained so far.AcknowledgementsThis research was partly supported by CNPq(Projects 479824/2009-6 and 309569/2009-5),FINEP and SEBRAE (COMUNICA projectFINEP/SEBRAE 1194/07).
