The findings of the study reveal cor-respondences between semantic notionsand syntactic manifestations of unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction in this language,thus presenting a computational analysis ofthe distinction at the syntax/semantics in-terface.
The approach is applicable to otherlanguages, particularly the ones which lackan explicit diagnostic such as auxiliary se-lection but has a number of diagnostics in-stead.1 IntroductionEver since Unaccusativity Hypothesis (UH,Perlmutter, 1978), it is widely recognized thatthere are two heterogeneous subclasses of in-transitive verbs, namely unaccusatives and un-ergatives.
The phenomenon of unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction is wide-ranging andlabeled in a variety of ways, including active,split S, and split intransitivity (SI).
(cf.
Mithun,1991).1Studies dealing with SI are numerous and re-cently, works taking auxiliary selection as thebasis of this syntactic phenomenon have in-creased (cf.
McFadden, 2007 and the referencestherein).
However, SI in languages that lack1  In this paper, the terms unaccusative/unergativedistinction and split intransitivity (SI) are usedinterchangeably.explicit syntactic manifestations such as auxil-iary selection has been less studied.2 Computa-tional approaches are even scarcer.
The majorgoal of this study is to discuss the linguistic is-sues surrounding SI in Turkish and present anovel computational approach that decideswhich verbs are unaccusative and which verbsare unergative in this language.
The computa-tional approach may in turn be used to study thesplit in lesser-known languages, especially theones lacking a clear diagnostic.
It may also beused with well-known languages where the splitis observed as a means to confirm earlier predic-tions made about SI.2 Approaches to Split Intransitivity (SI)Broadly speaking, approaches to the SI may besyntactic or semantic.
Syntactic approaches di-vide intransitive verbs into two syntacticallydistinct classes.
According to the seminal workof Perlmutter (1978), unaccusative and unerga-tive verbs form two syntactically distinct classesof intransitive verbs.
Within the context of Rela-tional Grammar, Perlmutter (1978) proposedthat unaccusative verbs have an underlying ob-ject promoted to the subject position, while un-ergative verbs have a base-generated subject.This hypothesis, known as the UnaccusativityHypothesis (UH) maintains that the mapping ofthe sole argument of an intransitive verb ontosyntax as subject or direct object is semanticallypredictable.
The UH distinguishes active or ac-tivity clauses (i.e., unergative clauses) from un-accusative ones.
Unergative clauses include2 An exception is Japanese.
For example see Kishimoto(1996), Hirakawa (1999), Oshita (1997), Sorace and Sho-mura (2001), and the references therein.
Also see Richa(2008) for Hindi.111willed or volitional acts (work, speak) and cer-tain involuntary bodily process predicates(cough, sleep); unaccusative clauses includepredicates whose initial term is semanticallypatient (fall, die), predicates of existing andhappening (happen, vanish), nonvoluntaryemission predicates (smell, shine), aspectualpredicates (begin, cease), and duratives (remain,survive).From a Government and Binding perspective,Burzio (1986) differentiates between two in-transitive classes by the verbs?
theta-markingproperties.
In unaccusative verbs (labeled ?erga-tives?
), the sole argument is the same as thedeep structure object; in unergative verbs, thesole argument is the same as the agent at thesurface.
The configuration of the two intransi-tive verb types may be represented simply asfollows:Unergatives: NP [VP  V]  John ran.Unaccusatives: [VP  V NP]   John fell.In its original formulation, the UH claimed thatthe determination of verbs as unaccusative orunergative somehow correlated with their se-mantics and since then, there has been so muchtheoretical discussion about how strong thisconnection is.
It has also been noted that a strictbinary division is actually not tenable becauseacross languages, some verbs fail to behaveconsistently with respect to certain diagnostics.For example, it has been shown that, with stan-dard diagnostics, certain verbs such as last, stink,bleed, die, etc can be classified as unaccusativein one language, unergative in a different lan-guage (Rosen, 1984; Zaenen, 1988, amongmany others).
This situation is referred to asunaccusativity mismatches.
New proposals thatspecifically focus on these problems have alsobeen made (e.g., Sorace, 2000, below).2.1 The Connection of Syntax and Seman-tics in SIFollowing the initial theoretical discussionsabout the connection between syntactic diagnos-tics and their semantic underpinnings, varioussemantic factors were suggested.
These involvedirected change and internal/external causation(Levin & Rappaport-Hovav, 1995), inferableeventual position or state (Lieber & Baayen,1997), telicity and controllability (Zaenen,1993), and locomotion (see Randall, 2007;Alexiadou et al, 2004, and, Aranovich, 2007,and McFadden, 2007 for reviews).
Some re-searchers have suggested that syntax has no rolein SI.
For example, van Valin (1990), focusingon Italian, Georgian, and Achenese, proposedthat SI is best characterized in terms of Aksion-sart and volitionality.
Kishimoto (1996) sug-gested that volitionality is the semantic parame-ter that largely determines unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction in Japanese.Auxiliary selection is among the most reliablesyntactic diagnostics proposed for SI.
This re-fers to the auxiliary selection properties of lan-guages that have two perfect auxiliaries corre-sponding to be and have in English.
In Romanceand Germanic languages such as Italian, Dutch,German, and to a lesser extent French, the equi-valents of be (essere, zijn, sein, etre) tend to beselected by unaccusative predicates while theequivalents of have (avere, haben, hebben,avoir) tend to be selected by unergative predi-cates (Burzio, 1986; Zaenen, 1993; Keller,2000; Legendre, 2007, among others).
In (1a?b)the situation is illustrated in French (F), German(G) and Italian (I).
(Examples are from Legen-dre, 2007).
(1) a. Maria a travaill?
(F)/hat gearbeitet(G)/ha lavorato (I).
?Maria worked.?b.
Maria est venue (F)/ist gekommen(G)/?
venuta (I).
?Maria came.
?Van Valin (1990) and Zaenen (1993) discussauxiliary selection as a manifestation of the se-mantic property of telicity.
Hence in Dutch,zijn-taking verbs are by and large telic, hebben-taking verbs are atelic.Impersonal passivization is another diagnosticthat seems applicable to a wide range of lan-guages and used by a number of authors, e.g.Perlmutter (1978), Hoekstra and Mulder (1990),Keller (2000).
This construction is predicted tobe grammatical with unergative clauses but notwith unaccusative clauses.
Zaenen (1993) notesthat impersonal passivization is controlled bythe semantic notion of protagonist control inDutch; therefore incompatibility of examplessuch as bleed with impersonal passivization is112attributed to the fact that bleed is not a protago-nist control verb.
Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (1995:141) take impersonal passivization as an unaccusativity diagnostic but take its sensitivity to protagonist control as a necessary but an in-sufficient condition for unergative verbs to al-low it.
In other words, only unergative verbs will be found in this construction, though not all of them.
Refinements of the UH have also been pro-posed.
Most notably, Sorace (2000) argued that the variation attested across languages (as well as within the dialects of a single language) is orderly, and that there are a number of cut-off points to which verb classes can be sensitive.
Sorace?s work on (monadic) intransitive verbs is built on variation in the perfective auxiliary selection of verbs in Romance and Germanic languages and called Auxiliary Selection Hier-archy (ASH).
She demonstrates that the varia-tion is based on a hierarchy of thematic and as-pectual specification of the verbs (viz., telicity and agentivity) and that it is a function of the position of a verb on the hierarchy.
Verbs with a high degree of aspectual and thematic specifica-tion occupy the extreme ends; variable verbs occupy the middle position, reflecting the de-creasing degree of aspectual specification.
Both cross-dialectally and across languages, these verbs may be used either with unaccusative or unergative syntax.3 The ASH therefore is a de-scriptive statement considering auxiliary selec-tion as a property characterized by both syntax and semantics, as originally viewed by the UH.
We now turn to Turkish, which lacks perfec-tive auxiliaries.
A number of other syntactic diagnostics, reviewed below, have been pro-posed but unlike auxiliaries in other languages, these are not obligatory constructions in Turk-ish.
In addition, the semantic properties underly-ing the proposed diagnostics have not been studied extensively.
Therefore, Turkish presents a particular challenge for any study about SI.
3 The claim that the two notions of ASH lie within a single dimensional hierarchy has been questioned by Randall (2007).
The ASH has also been criticized since it does not explain the reason why a certain language shows the pattern it does (McFadden, 2007).3 Diagnostics for SI in Turkish Just as other languages, intransitive verbs in Turkish are sensitive to a set of syntactic envi-ronments, summarized below.
3.1   The ?ArAk Construction One of the diagnostics is the ?ArAk construc-tion, which is an adverbial clause formed with the root verb plus the morpheme ?ArAk (?zkarag?z, 1986).
In a Turkish clause which involves the verbal suffix ?ArAk, both the con-troller (the complement verb) and the target (the matrix verb) have to be either unaccusative or unergative.
In addition, both the controlled and the target have to be the final (surface) subjects of the clause.
The examples below contain sen-tences where both the controller and the target verbs are unaccusative (2) or both are unerga-tive (3).
The examples also contain ungram-matical sentences where the controller verb is unergative whereas the target verb is unaccusa-tive (4), and those in which the controller verb is unaccusative whereas the target verb is unergative (5).
(Examples are from ?zkarag?z, 1986).
(2) Hasan [kol-u  kana -y -arak] ac?
?ek  -ti.
arm-POSS bleed-GL-ArAk suffer -PST  ?Hasan, while his arm bled, suffered.?
(3) K?z [ (top) oyna-y -arak]    ?ark?
s?yle-di.
girl    ball  play-GL-ArAk   sing -PST  ?The girl, while playing (ball), sang.?
(4) * K?z [ (top) oyna-y -arak]    kay-d?.
girl    ball  play-GL-ArAk   slip -PST  ?The girl, while playing (ball), slipped.?
(5) * K?z [kayak kay-arak]   d??-t?.
girl    ski-ArAk              fall-PST  ?The girl, while skiing, fell.?
3.2   Double Causatives  Double construction is allowed with unaccusa-tive verbs but not with unergatives, as shown in (6) and (7) below (?zkarag?z, 1986).
(6) Sema Turhan-a                ?i?e?-i         sol- dur     -t      -tu.
-DAT flower-ACC fade-CAUS-CAUS-PST113?Sema made Turhan cause the flower to fade.?
(7) * Ben Turhan-a Sema-y?
ko?-tur       -t       -t   -um  I                 -DAT   -ACC run-CAUS-CAUS-PST-1sg  ?I made Turhan make Sema run.?
3.3   Gerund Constructions The gerund constructions ?Irken ?while?
and  ?IncE ?when?
are further diagnostics.
The for-mer denotes simultaneous action and the latter denotes consecutive action.
Unergative verbs are predicted to be compatible with the ?Irken construction, whereas unaccusatives are pre-dicted to be compatible with the ?IncE con-struction, as shown in (8) and (9).4   (8) Adam ?al?
?-?rken esne-di.
man work-Irken yawn-PAST.3per.sg  ?The man yawned while working.?
(9) Atlet tak?l-?nca    d??-t?.
athlete trip-IncE fall-PAST.3per.sg  ?The athlete when tripped fell.?
3.4   The Suffix ?Ik It has also been suggested that the derivational suffix ?Ik, used for deriving adjectives from verbs, is compatible with unaccusatives but not with unergatives, as shown in (10) and (11).
(10) bat-?k    gemi  sink-Ik  ship  the sunk ship (11) *?al?
?-?k adam   work-Ik man  the worked man  3.5   The ?mI?
Participle The past participle marker ?mI?, which is used for deriving adjectives from verbs has been pro-posed as yet another diagnostic.
The suffix ?mI?
forms participles with transitive and intransitive verbs, as well as passivized verbs.
The basic requirement for the acceptability of the ?mI?
participle is the existence of an internal argu-ment in the clause.
In well-formed ?mI?
partici-ples, the modified noun must be the external                                                  4 Examples in sections 3.3 and 3.4 are from Nakipo?lu (1998).argument of a transitive verb (e.g., anne ?mother?
in [12]), or the internal argument of a passivized verb (e.g., bor?
?debt?
in [13]).
The internal argument of a transitive verb is not al-lowed as the modified noun as illustrated in (14).
(12) ?ocu?u-n-u      b?rak-m??
anne  Child-POSS-ACC  leave-mI?
mother  ?a/the mother who left her children?
(13) ?de-n-mi?
bor?
pay-PASS-mI?
debt  ?the paid debt?
(14) *?de-mi?
bor?
pay-mI?
debt  *?the pay debt?
As expected, the adjectives formed by intransi-tive verbs and the ?mI?
participle is more ac-ceptable with unaccusatives compared to uner-gatives, as shown in (15) and (16).
(15) sol-mu?/ karar-m??
?i?ek  wilt/ blacken -mI?
flower  ?The wilted/blackened flower?
(16) *s??ra-m?
?/ y?z-m?
?/ ba??r-m??
?ocuk  jump/ swim/ shout -mI?
child  ?The jumped/ swum/ shouted child?
3.6   Impersonal Passivization Impersonal passivization, used as a diagnostic to single out unergatives by some researchers, appears usable for Turkish as well.
In Turkish, impersonal passives carry the phonologically conditioned passive suffix marker, -Il, accom-panied by an indefinite human interpretation and a resistance to agentive by-phrases.
It has been suggested that the tense in which the verb appears affects the acceptability of impersonal passives: when the verb is in the aorist, the im-plicit subject has an arbitrary interpretation, i.e.
either a generic or existential interpretation.
On the other hand, in those cases when the verb is in past tense, the implicit subject has a referen-tial meaning, namely a first person plural read-ing.
It was therefore suggested that impersonal passivization is a proper diagnostic environment only in the past tense, which was also adopted in the present study (Nakipo?lu-Demiralp, 2001, cf.
Sezer, 1991).
(17) and (18) exemplify114impersonal passivization with the verb in the past tense.
(17) Burada ko?uldu.
Here     run-PASS-PST  ?There was running here.?
(existential interpretation)  (18) ?
?Bu yetimhanede     b?y?nd?.
This orphanage-LOC grow-PASS-PST  ?It was grown in this orphanage.?
The diagnostics summarized above do not al-ways pick out the same verbs in Turkish.
For example, most diagnostics will fare well with the verbs d?
?- ?fall?, gel- ?come?, gir- ?enter?
(with a human subject) just as well as imper-sonal passivization.
In other words, these verbs are unaccusative according to most diagnostics and unergative according to impersonal passivization.
The opposite of this situation also holds.
The stative verb devam et- ?continue?
is bad or marginally acceptable with most diagnostics as well as impersonal passivization.
The conclusion is that in Turkish, acceptabil-ity judgments with the proposed diagnostic en-vironments do not yield a clear distinction be-tween unaccusative and unergative verbs.
In addition, it is not clear which semantic proper-ties these diagnostics are correlated with.
The model described below is expected to provide some answers to these issues.
It is based on na-tive speaker judgments but it goes beyond them by computationally showing that there are cor-respondences between semantic notions and syntactic manifestations of SI in Turkish.
The model is presented below.
4 The Model This study employs feed-forward artificial neu-ral networks with a backpropagation algorithm as computational models for the analysis of un-accusative/unergative distinction in Turkish.
4.1 Artificial Neural Networks and Learn-ing Paradigms  An artificial neural network (ANN) is a compu-tational model that can be used as a non-linear statistical data modeling tool.
ANNs are gener-ally used for deriving a function from observa-tions, in applications where the data are com-plex and it is difficult to devise a relationshipbetween observations and outputs by hand.
ANNs are characterized by interconnected group of artificial neurons, namely nodes.
An ANN generally has three major layers of nodes: a single input layer, a single or multiple hidden layers, and a single output layer.
In a feedfor-ward ANN, the outputs from all the nodes go to succeeding but not preceding layers.
There are three major learning paradigms that are used for training ANNs: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learn-ing.
A backpropagation algorithm is a super-vised learning method which is used for teach-ing a neural network how to perform a specific task.
Accordingly, a feed-forward ANN with a backpropagation algorithm is a computational tool that models the relationship between obser-vations and output by employing supervised learning method (see Hertz et al, 1991; Ander-son & Rosenfeld, 1988, among many others for ANNs).
The following section presents how such an ANN is used for analyzing unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction in Turkish.
4.2 The Analysis  Two feed-forward ANNs with a backpropaga-tion algorithm were developed for the analysis.
Both models had a single input layer, a single hidden layer, and a single output layer of nodes.
Both models had a single output node, which represents the binary status of a given verb as unaccusative (0) or unergative (1).
The number of nodes in the hidden layer was variable (see below for a discussion of network parameters).
The difference between the two models was the design of the input layer.
The first model (henceforth, the diagnostics model DIAG) took diagnostics as input nodes, whereas the second model (henceforth, the semantic parameters model SEMANP) took semantic parameters as input nodes, as presented in detail below.
The Diagnostics Model (DIAG): Binary ac-ceptability values of the phrases or sentences formed by the syntactic diagnostics constituted the input nodes for the network (see above for the SI diagnostics).
Each syntactic diagnostic provided a binary value (either 0 or 1) to one of the input nodes.
For example, consider the ?mI?
participle as one of the syntactic diagnostics for SI in Turkish.
As discussed above, the ?mI?
par-ticiple forms acceptable adjectival phrases with115unaccusative verbs (e.g., sol- ?wilt?)
but not with the unergative verbs (e.g., s?
?ra- ?jump, leap?
), as shown in (19) and (20) below.
(19) sol-mu?
?i?ek-ler             wilt-mI?
flower-PLU            ?wilted flowers?
(20) *s??ra-m??
sporcu-lar              jump-mI?
sportsman-PLU             ?jumped sportsmen?
Accordingly, for the verb sol- ?wilt?, the ?mI?
participle diagnostic provides the value 1 with one of the input nodes, whereas for the verb s?
?ra- ?jump, leap?
it provides the value 0 with the corresponding input node.
In this way, the syntactic diagnostics constituted an input pat-tern with eight members for each verb.5 The construction of an input pattern is exemplified in (21) for the unergative verb konu?- ?talk?.

c. *Adam kad?na ?ocu?u konu?turttu.
:0  ?The man made the woman have the boy talked.?
d. Adam konu?urken y?r?d?.
:1  The man talk-Irken walk-PST     ?The man walked while talking.?
e. Adam konu?unca y?r?d?.
:1  The man speak-IncE walk-PST   ?The man walked when he talked.?
f. *Konu?-uk adam :0  Talk-Ik man   ?The talked man?
g. *Konu?-mu?
adam :0  Talk-mI?
man   ?The talked man?
h. T?rende konu?uldu.
:1  Ceremony-LOC talk-PASS   ?It was spoken in the ceremony.?
5  One of the syntactic diagnostics (the gerund suffix   ?ArAk ) involves two verbs (i.e., the target and the matrix verb).
Therefore, two sentences/phrases were formed?one with unaccusatives and the other with unergatives?which provided two binary values with the input pattern.Accordingly, the input pattern for the verb konu?- ?talk?
is schematically shown below.
0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1    The Semantic Parameters Model (SE-MANP): The input nodes for the SEMANP network were constituted by four binary values that represented the status of four semantic pa-rameters (telicity, volitionality, dynamicity, and directed motion) for each verb.
Each semantic parameter provided a binary value (either 0 or 1) to one of the input nodes.
The value of the input nodes were determined by applying the follow-ing tests for the relevant semantic aspects: (1) in/for an hour test for telicity (e.g.
the phrase to talk *in/for an hour shows that the verb talk is atelic whereas the phrase to wilt in/*for an hour shows that the verb wilt is telic), (2) on purpose test for volitionality, (3) hala- ?still?
test for dy-namicity, (4) and the dative test (i.e., acceptabil-ity of adding a dative term to the verb) for di-rected motion.
The construction of an input pattern for SE-MANP is exemplified in (22) for the unaccusa-tive verb sol- ?wilt?.
(22) A sample input pattern for DIAG.
a. Telic :1 b. Non-volitional :0 c. Non-dynamic :0 d. No directed motion :0  Accordingly, the input pattern for the verb sol- ?wilt?
is schematically shown below.
1 0 0 0 4.3 The Training Phase The network was trained by providing patterns for 52 verbs that are recognized as unaccusa-tives in the SI literature or placed closer to the unaccusative end rather than the unergative end of the Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy (ASH, So-race, 2000); and 52 verbs that are recognized to be unaccusative in the SI literature or placed closer to the unergative end rather than the un-accusative end of the ASH.
As a result, a total of 104 input patterns, each composed of eight nodes, were used to train the DIAG model and 104 input patterns, each composed of four nodes, were used to train the SEMANP model.
The116single output node was set to 0 if the verb with the given input pattern was unaccusative and it was set to 1 if the verb was unergative.
Super-vised learning method was used, as employed by the backpropagation algorithm.
One hidden layer with a variable number of hidden units was used (see below for the analy-sis of model parameters).
Sigmoid activation function, shown in (23), was used for modeling the activation function.
(23)xexf?+=11)(The number of maximum iterations per epoch was set to 20.
The system sensitivity was de-fined by a global variable (?=0.01) which de-cided whether the loops in the code converge or not.
4.4 The Test Phase The DIAG and SEMANP models were tested by providing the following input patterns:    Group A: five verbs that are either recog-nized as unaccusatives in the SI literature or placed closer to the unaccusative end rather than the unergative end of the ASH.
Group B: Five verbs that are either recog-nized as unergatives in the SI literature or placed closer to the unergative end rather than the unaccusative end of the ASH.
Group C: Three verbs that are reported to exhibit variable behavior within the ASH.
After the training, the networks provided the binary outputs for the test verbs, which showed whether a test verb was unaccusative or unerga-tive according to the models.
5 Results The results are presented in the two sections below, separately for the DIAG model and for the SEMANP model.
5.1 The DIAG Model After the training of the network and the opti-mization of the number of hidden units and the learning rate, the DIAG model classified all verbs in Group A as unaccusatives.
The modelalso classified all Group-B verbs as unergatives.
Finally, the model categorized three Group-C verbs that were reported to show variable be-havior (kana- ?bleed?, parla- ?shine?
and ??
?- ?be, feel cold?)
as unaccusative verbs in Turkish.
The distribution of weights after the training showed that the ?mI?
participle received the highest weight, which indicates that the ?mI?
participle is the most reliable diagnostics for analyzing unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish.
5.2  The SEMANP Model The SEMANP model classified two of the Group-A verbs (namely, gir- ?enter?
and yeti?- ?grow?)
as unaccusatives and the three remain-ing verbs (dur- ?remain, stay?, kal- ?stall, stay, and varol- ?exist?)
as unergatives.
The model also classified four of five Group-B verbs (g?l- ?laugh?, s?r?t- ?grin?, s?ylen- ?mutter?, yak?n- ?complain?)
as unergatives and the remaining verb (y?z- ?swim?)
as unaccusative.
Finally, the model categorized three Group-C verbs (kana- ?bleed?, parla- ?shine?
and ??
?- ?be, feel cold?)
as unaccusative verbs in Turkish.
The distribution of weights after the training showed that among the four semantic parame-ters that were selected in this study, telicity re-ceived the highest weight, which indicates that unaccusative and unergative verbs are most sen-sitive to the telicity aspect of the verb in Turkish.
5.3 Evaluation of Model Parameters Four model design parameters, their initial val-ues and acceptable ranges after optimization are discussed below.
The number of hidden units: The number of hidden layers was set to 1 as a non-variable de-sign parameter of the network.
The initial num-ber of hidden units was set to 3.
Keeping the learning rate (?=-0.25) and the momentum term (?=0.25) constant, the number of hidden units was adjusted and the behavior of the network was observed.
The analyses showed that the optimum range for the number of hidden units was between 2 and 6.
The learning rate: The learning rate was ini-tially set to ?=-0.25.
Keeping the number of hidden units (hidden_size=3) and the momen-tum term (?=0.25) constant, adjusting the learn-117ing rate between ?=-0.005 and ?=-0.9 did not have an effect on the results.
The momentum term: The momentum term was set to ?=0.25 initially.
Keeping the number of hidden units (hidden_size=3) and the learn-ing rate (?=-0.25) constant, adjusting the mo-mentum term between ?=0.01 and ?=1.0 did not have an effect on the results.
However, the sys-tem did not converge to a solution for the mo-mentum term equal to and greater than ?=1.0.
6 Discussion A major finding of the suggested model is that the predictions of the two models are compati-ble with the UH (Perlmutter, 1978) in that they divide most intransitive verbs into two, as ex-pected.
Furthermore, the differences between the decisions of the diagnostics-based DIAG model and the semantic-parameters-based  SEMANP model reflect a reported finding in the unaccusativity literature, i.e., the tests used to differentiate between unaccusatives and unergatives do not uniformly delegate all verbs to the same classes (the solution of why such mismatches occur in Turkish is beyond the scope of this study, see Sorace, 2000; Randall, 2007, for some suggestions).
More specifically, the three Group-A verbs that were predicted as unaccusative by the DIAG model and unerga-tive by the SEMANP model (dur- ?remain, stay?, kal- ?stall, stay, and varol- ?exist?)
are stative verbs, which are known to show inconsistent behavior in the literature and classified as vari-able-behavior verbs by Sorace (2000).
An un-expected finding is the Group-B verb (y?z- ?swim?
), which is predicted as unergative by the DIAG model and unaccusative by the SEMANP model.
This seems to reflect the role of seman-tic parameters other than telicity (namely, dy-namicity and directed motion) in Turkish.
The remaining nine verbs of thirteen tested verbs were predicted to be of the same type (either unaccusative or unergative) by both models.
Another finding of the model is the alignment between the most weighted syntactic diagnos-tics for unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish, namely the ?mI?
participle which re-ceived the highest weight after the training, and the most weighted semantic parameter, namely telicity.7 Conclusion and Future Research This study contributes to our understanding of the distinction in several respects.
Firstly, it proposes a novel computational ap-proach that tackles the unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish.
The model confirms that a split between unaccusative and unergative verbs indeed exists in Turkish but that the divi-sion is not clear-cut.
The model suggests that certain verbs (e.g., stative verbs) behave incon-sistently, as mentioned in most accounts in the literature.
Moreover, the model reflects a corre-spondence between syntactic diagnostics and semantics, which supports the view that unaccu-sativity is semantically determined and syntacti-cally manifested (Permutter, 1978, Levin & Rappaport-Hovav, 1995).
Since this approach uses relevant language-dependent features, it is particularly applicable to languages that lack explicit syntactic diagnostics of SI.
The computational approach is based on the connectionist paradigm which employs feed-forward artificial neural networks with a back-propagation algorithm.
There are several dimen-sions in which the model will further be devel-oped.
First, the reliability of input node values will be strengthened by conducting acceptability judgment experiments with native speakers, and the training of the model will be improved by increasing the number of verbs used for training.
Acceptability judgments are influenced not only by verbs but also by other constituents in clauses or sentences; therefore the input data will be improved to involve different senses of verbs under various sentential constructions.
Second, alternative classifiers, such as decision trees and na?ve Bayes, as well as the classifiers that use discretized weights may provide more informative accounts of the findings of SI in Turkish.
These alternatives will be investigated in further studies.
