?PeaceWest King?
to refer to ?Bo Xilai?)
to avoidactive censorship or achieve other com-munication goals.
In this paper we aimto solve a new problem of resolving en-tity morphs to their real targets.
We ex-ploit temporal constraints to collect cross-source comparable corpora relevant to anygiven morph query and identify target can-didates.
Then we propose various novelsimilarity measurements including surfacefeatures, meta-path based semantic fea-tures and social correlation features andcombine them in a learning-to-rank frame-work.
Experimental results on ChineseSina Weibo data demonstrate that our ap-proach is promising and significantly out-performs baseline methods1.1 IntroductionLanguage constantly evolves to maximize com-municative success and expressive power in dailysocial interactions.
The proliferation of online so-cial media significantly expedites this evolution,as new phrases triggered by social events may bedisseminated rapidly in social media.
To automati-cally analyze such fast evolving language in socialmedia, new computational models are demanded.In this paper, we focus on one particular lan-guage evolution that creates new ways to commu-nicate sensitive subjects because of the existenceof internet information censorship.
We call this1Some of the resources and open source programs devel-oped in this work are made freely available for research pur-pose at http://nlp.cs.qc.cuny.edu/Morphing.tar.gzphenomenon information morph.
For example,when Chinese online users talk about the formerpolitician ?Bo Xilai?, they use a morph ?PeaceWest King?
instead, a historical figure four hun-dreds years ago who governed the same regionas Bo.
Morph can be considered as a specialcase of alias used for hiding true entities in ma-licious environment (Hsiung et al, 2005; Pantel,2006).
However, social network plays an impor-tant role in generating morphs.
Usually morphsare generated by harvesting the collective wisdomof the crowd to achieve certain communicationgoals.
Aside from the purpose of avoiding cen-sorship, other motivations for using morph includeexpressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative senti-ment or making descriptions more vivid towardsome entities or events.
Table 1 presents the widerange of cases that are used to create the morphs.We can see that a morph can be either a regularterm with new meaning or a newly created term.Morph Target MotivationPeace West King Bo Xilai SensitiveBlind Man Chen Guangcheng SensitiveMiracle Brother Wang Yongping IronyKim Fat Kim Joing-il NegativeKimchi Country South Korea VividTable 1: Morph Examples and Motivations.We believe that successful resolution of morphsis a crucial step for automated understanding ofthe fast evolving social media language, whichis important for social media marketing (Bar-wise and Meehan, 2010).
Another applicationis to help common users without enough back-ground/cultural knowledge to understand internetlanguage for their daily use.
Furthermore, our ap-proaches can also be applied for satire or other im-plicit meaning recognition, as well as informationextraction (Bollegala et al, 2011).1083However, morph resolution in social media ischallenging due to the following reasons.
First,the sensitive real targets that exist in the samedata source under active censorship are often au-tomatically filtered.
Table 2 presents the distribu-tions of some examples of morphs and their tar-gets in English Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo.For example, the target ?Chen Guangcheng?
onlyappears once in Weibo.
Thus, the co-occurrenceof a morph and its target is quite low in the vastamount of information in social media.
Second,most morphs were not created based on pronunci-ations, spellings or other encryptions of their origi-nal targets.
Instead, they were created according tosemantically related entities in historical and cul-tural narratives (e.g.
?Peace West King?
as morphof ?Bo Xilai?)
and thus very difficult to capturebased on typical lexical features.
Third, tweetsfrom Twitter/Chinese Weibo are short (only up to140 characters) and noisy, resulting in difficult ex-traction of rich and accurate evidences due to thelack of enough contexts.Frequency in  Twitter Frequency in  Weibo Morph Target Morph Target Morph Target Hu Ji Hu Jintao 1 3,864 2,611 71 Blind  Man Chen  Guangcheng 18 2,743 20,941 1 Baby Wen Jiabao 2238 2021 26,279 8Table 2: Distributions of Morph ExamplesTo the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork to use NLP and social network analysis tech-niques to automatically resolve morphed informa-tion.
To address the above challenges, our paperoffers the following novel contributions.?
We detect target candidates by exploiting thedynamics of the social media to extract tem-poral distribution of entities, based on the as-sumption that the popularity of an individ-ual is correlated between censored and un-censored text within a certain time window.?
Our approach builds and analyzes heteroge-neous information networks from multiplesources, such as Twitter, Sina Weibo and webdocuments in formal genre (e.g.
news) be-cause a morph and its target tend to appear insimilar contexts.?
We propose two new similarity measures, aswell as integrating temporal information intothe similarity measures to generate global se-mantic features.?
We model social user behaviors and use so-cial correlation to assist in measuring seman-tic similarities because the users who posteda morph and its corresponding target tend toshare similar interests and opinions.Our experiments demonstrate that the pro-posed approach significantly outperforms tradi-tional alias detection methods (Hsiung et al,2005).2 Approach Overview   Morph Query   Comparable Data AcquisitionTarget Candidate RankingTargetLearning to RankSemantic FeaturesSemantic Annotation and  Target Candidate IdentificationSurface Features Social FeaturesCensored Data Uncensored DataFigure 1: Overview of Morph ResolutionGiven a morph query m, the goal of morph res-olution is to find its real target.
Figure 1 depictsthe general procedure of our approach.
It consistsof two main sub-tasks:?
Target Candidate Identification: For eachm, discover a list of target candidates E ={e1, e2, ..., eN}.
First, relevant comparabledata sets that include m are retrieved.
Inthis paper we collect comparable censoreddata from Weibo and uncensored data fromTwitter and Web documents such as news ar-ticles.
We then apply various annotationssuch as word segmentation, part-of-speechtagging, noun phrase chunking, name taggingand event extraction to these data sets.?
Target Candidate Ranking: Rank the targetcandidates in E. We explore various featuresincluding surface, semantic and social fea-tures, and incorporate them into a learning to1084rank framework.
Finally, the top ranked can-didate is produced as the resolved target.3 Target Candidate IdentificationThe general goal of the first step is to identify a listof target candidates for each morph query from thecomparable corpora including Sina Weibo, Chi-nese News websites and English Twitter.
How-ever, obviously we cannot consider all of thenamed entities in these sources as target candi-dates due to the sheer volume of information.
Inaddition, morphs are not limited to named entityforms.
In order to narrow down the scope of tar-get candidates, we propose a Temporal Distribu-tion Assumption as follows.
The intuition is thata morph m and its real target e should have sim-ilar temporal distributions in terms of their occur-rences.
Suppose the data sets are separated into Ztemporal slots (e.g.
by day), the assumption canbe stated as:Let Tm = {tm1, tm2, ..., tmZm} be the set oftemporal slots each morph m occurs, and Te ={te1, te2, ..., teZe} be the set of slots a target can-didate e occurs.
Then e is considered as a targetcandidate of m if and only if, for each tmi ?
Tm(i = 1, 2, ..., Zm), there exist a j ?
{1, 2, ..., Ze}such that tmi ?
tej ?
?, where ?
is a thresholdvalue (in this paper we set the threshold to 7 days,which is optimized from a development set).
Forcomparison we also attempted topic modeling ap-proach to detect target candidates, as shown in sec-tion 5.3.4 Target Candidate RankingNext, we propose a learning-to-rank framework torank target candidates based on various levels ofnovel features based on surface, semantic and so-cial analysis.4.1 Surface FeaturesWe first extract surface features between themorph and the candidate based on measuring or-thographic similarity measures which were com-monly used in entity coreference resolution (e.g.
(Ng, 2010; Hsiung et al, 2005)).
The measureswe use include ?string edit distance?, ?normalizedstring edit distance?
(Wagner and Fischer, 1974)and ?longest common subsequence?
(Hirschberg,1977).4.2 Semantic Features4.2.1 MotivationsFortunately, although a morph and its target mayhave very different orthographic forms, they tendto be embedded in similar semantic contextswhich involve similar topics and events.
Figure 2presents some example messages under censor-ship (Weibo) and not under censorship (Twitterand Chinese Daily).
We can see that they includesimilar topics, events (e.g., ?fell from power?,?gang crackdown?, ?sing red songs?
), and se-mantic relations (e.g., family relations with ?BoGuagua?).
Therefore if we can automatically ex-tract and exploit these indicative semantic con-texts, we can narrow down the real targets effec-tively.

: V ?
A and a link type mapping func-tion ?
: E ?
R, where each object v ?
V belongsto one particular object type ?
(v) ?
A, each linke ?
E belongs to a particular relation ?
(e) ?
R.If two links belong to the same relation type, thenthey share the same starting object type as well asthe same ending object type.
An information net-work is homogeneous if and only if there is onlyone type for both objects and links, and an infor-mation network is heterogeneous when the objectsare from multiple distinct types or there exist morethan one type of links.In order to construct the information networksfor morphs, we apply the Standford Chinese word1085segmenter with Chinese Penn Treebank segmen-tation standard (Chang et al, 2008) and Stan-ford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003)to process each sentence in the comparable datasets.
Then we apply a hierarchical Hidden MarkovModel (HMM) based Chinese lexical analyzerICTCLAS (Zhang et al, 2003) to extract namedentities, noun phrases and events.We have also attempted using the results fromDependency Parsing, Relation Extraction andEvent Extraction tools (Ji and Grishman, 2008)to enrich the link types.
Unfortunately the state-of-the-art techniques for these tasks still performpoorly on social media in terms of both accuracyand coverage of important information, these so-phisticated semantic links all produced negativeimpact on the target ranking performance.
There-fore we limited the types of vertices into: Morph(M), Entity(E), which includes target candidates,Event (EV), and Non-Entity Noun Phrases (NP);and used co-occurrence as the edge type.
We ex-tract entities, events, and non-entity noun phrasesthat occur in more than one tweet as neighbors.And for two vertices xi and xj , the weight wijof their edge is the frequency they co-occur to-gether within the tweets.
A network schema ofsuch networks is shown in Figure 3.
Figure 4ME NPEVFigure 3: Network Schema of Morph-Related Het-erogeneous Information Networkpresents an example of a heterogeneous informa-tion network from the motivation examples fol-lowing the above network schema, which connectsthe morphs ?Peace West King?, ?Buhou?
and theircorresponding target ?Bo Xilai?.4.2.3 Meta-Path-Based Semantic SimilarityMeasurementsGiven the constructed network, a straightforwardsolution for finding the target for a morph is to uselink-based similarity search.
However, now ob-jects are linked to different types of neighbors, ifall neighbors are treated as the same, it may causeinformation loss problems.
For example, the en-tity ???

is a very important aspectcharacterizing the politician ????
(Bo Xilai)?GangCrackdownFell FromPowerChongqingSing RedSongsBuhouPeaceWestKingBoXilaiBoGuaguaEntityEntityEntityEventEventEventMorphMorphFigure 4: Example of Morph-Related Heteroge-neous Information Networksince he governed it, and if a morph m which isalso highly correlated with ???
(Chongqing)?, itis very likely that ?Bo Xilai?
is the real target ofm.Therefore, the semantic features generated fromneighbors such as the entity ???
(Chongqing)?should be treated differently from other types ofneighbors such as ???
(talented people)?
.In this work, we propose to measure the simi-larity of two nodes over heterogeneous networksas shown in Figure 3, by distinguishing neighborsinto three types according to the network schema(i.e.
entities, events, non-entity noun phrases).
Wethen adopt meta-path-based similarity measures(Sun et al, 2011a; Sun et al, 2011b), which aredefined over heterogeneous networks to extract se-mantic features.
A meta-path is a path defined overa network, and composed of a sequence of rela-tions between different object types.
For example,as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target can-didate can be connected by three meta-paths, in-cluding ?M - E - E?, ?M - EV - E?, and ?M - NP- E?.
Intuitively, each meta-path provides a uniqueangle to measure how similar two objects are.For the determined meta-paths, we extract se-mantic features using the similarity measures pro-posed in (Sun et al, 2011a; Hsiung et al, 2005).We denote the neighbor sets of certain type for amorph m and a target candidate e as ?
(m) and?
(e), and a meta-path as P .
We now list severalmeta-path-based similarity measures below.Common neighbors (CN).
It measures the num-ber of common neighbors that m and e share as|?
(m) ?
?
(e)|.Path count (PC).
It measures the number of pathinstances betweenm and e following meta-pathP .Pairwise random walk (PRW).
For a meta-path P that can be decomposed into two shorter1086meta-paths with the same length P = (P1P2),pairwise random walk measures the probabil-ity of the pairwise random walk starting fromboth m and e and reaching the same mid-dle object.
More formally, it is computed as?(p1p2)?
(P1P2) prob(p1)prob(p?12 ), where p?12 isthe inverse of p2.Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD).
For m ande, the pairwise random walk probability of theirneighbors can be represented as two probabilityvectors, then Kullback-Leibler distance (Hsiunget al, 2005) can be used to compute sim(m, e).Beyond the above similarity measures, we alsopropose to use cosine-similarity-style normaliza-tion method to modify common neighbor and pair-wise random walk measures so that we can ensurethe morph node and the target candidate node arestrongly connected and also have similar popular-ity.
The modified algorithms penalize features in-volved with the highly popular objects, since theyare more likely to have accidental interactions witheach other.Normalized common neighbors (NCN).
Nor-malized common neighbors can be measured assim(m, e) = |?(m)??(e)|?|?(m)|?|?(e)|.
It refines the simplecounting of common neighbors by avoiding biasto highly visible or concentrated objects.Pairwise random walk/cosine (PRW/cosine).Pairwise random walk measures linkage weightsdisproportionately with their visibility to theirneighbors, which may be too strong.
Instead, wepropose to use a tamer normalization method as?(p1p2)?
(P1P2) f(p1)f(p?12 ), where.f(p1) = count(m,x)??x??
count(m,x),f(p2) = count(e, x)??x??
count(e, x),and ?
is the set of middle objects connecting thedecomposed meta-paths p1 and p?12 , count(y, x)is the total number of paths between y and the mid-dle object x, y could be m or e.The above similarity measures can also be ap-plied to homogeneous networks that do not differ-entiate the neighbor types.4.2.4 Global Semantic Feafure GenerationA morph tends to have higher temporal correlationwith its real target, and share more similar topicscompared to other irrelevant targets.
Therefore,we propose to incorporate temporal informationinto similarity measures to generate global seman-tic features.Let T = t1 ?
t2 ?
... ?
tN be a set of temporalslots (i.e.
by day),E be the set of target candidatesfor each morphm.
Then for each ti ?
T , and eache ?
E, the local semantic features simti(m, e)is extracted based only on the information postedwithin ti using one of the similarity measures in-troduced in Section 4.2.3.
Then we propose twoapproaches to generate global semantic features.The first approach is adding the similarity scorebetween m and e in each temporal slot to attainthe first set of global features:simglobal sum(m, e) =?ti?Tsimti(m, e).The second method first normalizes the similarityscore in each temporal slot ti, them sum the nor-malized scores to generate the second set of globalfeatures, which can be calculated assimglobal norm(m, e) =?ti?Tnormti(m, e).where normti(m, e) = simti (m,e)?e?E simti (m,e) .4.2.5 Integrate Cross Source/Cross GenreInformationDue to internet information censorship or surveil-lance, users may need to use morphs to post sensi-tive information.
For example, the Chinese Weibomessage ?????,???????
(Alreadyput in prison, still need to serve Buhou??
includea morph ??
(Buhou).
In contrast, users are lessrestricted in some other uncensored social mediasuch as Twitter.
For example, the tweet from Twit-ter ?...?????????????????...
(...call Bo Xilai?peace west king?
or ?buhou?...
)?contains both the morph and the real target ???
(Bo Xilai).
Therefore, we propose to integrateinformation from another source (e.g.
Twitter) tohelp resolution of sensitive morphs in Weibo.Another difficulty from morph resolution inmicro-blogging is that tweets are only allowed tocontain maximum 140 characters with a lot ofnoise and diverse topics.
The shortness and di-versity of tweets may limit the power of contentanalysis for semantic feature extraction.
However,formal genres such as web documents are cleanerand contain richer contexts, thus can provide moretopically related information.
In this work, we alsoexploit the background web documents from the1087embedded URLs in tweets to enrich informationnetwork construction.
After applying the same an-notation techniques as tweets for uncensored datasets, sentence-level co-occurrence relations are ex-tracted and integrated into the network as shown inFigure 3.4.3 Social FeaturesIt has been shown that there exist correlation be-tween neighbors in social networks (Anagnos-topoulos et al, 2008; Wen and Lin, 2010).
Be-cause of such social correlation, close socialneighbors in social media such as Twitter andWeibo may post similar information, or share sim-ilar opinion.
Therefore, we can utilize social cor-relation to assist in resolving morphs.As social correlation can be defined as a func-tion of social distance between a pair of users, weuse social distance as a proxy to social correla-tion in our approach.
The social distance betweenuser i and j is defined by considering the degreeof separation in their interaction (e.g.
retweet-ing and mentioning) and the amount of the in-teraction.
Similar definition has been shown ef-fective in characterizing social distance in socialnetworks extracted from communication data (Linet al, 2012; Wen and Lin, 2010).
Specifically,it is dist(i, j) = ?K?1k=1 1strength(vk,vk+1) , wherev1, ..., vk are the nodes on the shortest path fromuser i to user j, and strength(vk, vk+1) measuresthe strength of interactions between vk and vk+1as: strength(i, j) = log(Xij)maxj log(Xij) , where Xij isthe total interactions between user i and j, includ-ing both retweeting and mentioning (If Xij < 10,we set strength(i, j) = 0).We integrate social correlation and temporal in-formation to define our social features.
The in-tuition is that when a morph is used by an user,the real target may also in the posts by the user orhis/her close friends within a certain time period.Let T be the set of temporal slots a morph m oc-curs, Ut be the set of users whose posts include min slot t where t ?
T , and Uc be the set of closefriends (i.e., social distance < 0.5) for Ut.
Thesocial features are defined ass(m, e) =?t?T f(e, t, Ut, Uc)|T | .where f(e, t, Ut, Uc) is a indicator function whichreturn 1 if one of the users in Ut or Uc posts tweetsinclude the target candidate e within 7 days beforet.4.4 Learning-to-RankSimilar to (Hsiung et al, 2005; Sun et al, 2011a),we then model the probability of linkage predic-tion between a morph m and its target candidatee as a function incorporating the surface, semanticand social features.
Given a training pair ?m, e?,we choose the standard logistic regression modelto learn weights for the features defined above.The learnt model is used to predict the probabil-ity of linking an unseen morph and its target can-didate.
Based on the descending ranking order ofthe probability, we select top k candidates as thefinal answers based on the answer size k.5 ExperimentsNext, we present the experiment under various set-tings shown in Table 3, and the impacts of crosssource and cross genre information.5.1 Data and Evaluation MetricWe collected 1, 553, 347 tweets from Chinese SinaWeibo from May 1 to June 30 to construct thecensored data set, and retrieved 66, 559 web doc-uments from the embedded URLs in tweets as theinitial uncensored data set.
Retweets and redun-dant web documents are filtered to ensure morereliable frequency counting of co-occurrence rela-tions.
We asked two native Chinese annotators toanalyze the data, and construct a test set consistedof 107 morph entities (81 persons and 26 loca-tions) and their real targets as our references.
Weverified the references by Web resources includ-ing the summary of popular morphs in Wikipedia2.
In addition, we used 23 sensitive morphs andthe entities that appear in the tweets as queries andretrieved 25, 128 Chinese tweets from 10% Twit-ter feeds within the same time period, as well as7, 473 web documents from the embedded URLsand added them into the uncensored data set.To evaluate the system performance, we useleave-one-out cross validation by computing ac-curacy as Acc@k = CkQ , where Ck is the to-tal number of correctly resolved morphs at topk ranked answers, and Q is the total number ofmorph queries.
We consider a morph as correctlyresolved at the top k answers if the top k answerset contains the real target of the morph.2http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/?????????

Glob only uses the same set of similarity measures when combinedwith other semantic features.5.2 Resolution Performance5.2.1 Single Genre InformationWe first study the contributions of each set of sur-face and semantic features, as shown in the firstfive rows in Table 4.
The poor performance basedon surface features shows that morph resolutiontask is very challenging since 70% of morphs arenot orthographically similar to their real targets.Thus, capturing a morph?s semantic meaning iscrucial.
Overall, the results demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of our proposed methods.
Specifi-cally, comparing ?HomB?
and ?HetB?, ?HomE?and ?HetE?, we can see that the semantic fea-tures based on heterogeneous networks have ad-vantages over those based on homogeneous net-works.
This corroborates that different neighborsets contribute differently, and such discrepanciesshould be captured.
And comparisions of ?HomB?and ?HomE?, ?HetB?
and ?HetE?demonstrate theeffectiveness of our two new proposed measures.To evaluate the importance of each similarity mea-sures, we delete the semantic features obtainedfrom each measure in ?HetE?
and re-evaluate thesystem.
We find that NCN is the most effectivemeasure, while KLD is the least important one.Further adding the global semantic features signif-icantly improves the performance.
This indicatesthat capturing both temporal correlations and se-mantics of morphing simultaneously are importantfor morph resolution.Table 5 shows that combination of surface andsemantic features further improves the perfor-mance, showing that they are complementary.

Table 6 shows that further gainscan be achieved.
Notice that integrating tweetsfrom Twitter mainly improves the ranking for topk where k > 1.
This is because Weibo dominatesour dataset, and in Weibo many of these sensi-tive morphs are mostly used with their traditionalmeanings instead of the morph senses.

The gain is small since the combinationof all features in the learning to rank frameworkcan already well capture the relationship betweena morph and a target candidate.
Nevertheless, thetemporal distribution assumption is effective.
Ithelps to filter out 80% of unrelated targets andspeed up the system 5 times, while retain 98.5%of the morph candidates that can be detected.System Acc@1 Acc@5 Acc@10 Acc@20Without 0.365 0.579 0.645 0.696With 0.379 0.594 0.659 0.701Table 8: The Effects of Temporal ConstraintWe also attempted using topic modeling ap-proach to detect target candidates.
Due to the largeamount of data, we first split the data set on a dailybasis, then applied Probabilistic Latent SemanticAnalysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999).
Named enti-ties which co-occur at least ?
times with a morphquery in the same topic are selected as its targetcandidates.
As shown in Table9 (K is the num-ber of predefined topics), PLSA is not quite effec-tive mainly because traditional topic modeling ap-proaches do not perform well on short texts fromsocial media.
Therefore, in this paper we choosea simple method based on temporal distribution todetect target candidates.Method All Temporal PLSA( PLSA(K = 5 K = 5?

approach (Hsiung et al, 2005),our proposed approach achieves significantly bet-ter performance (99.9% confidence level by theWilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test forAcc@1).
We further explore two types of factorswhich may affect the system performance as fol-lows.One important aspect affecting the resolutionperformance is the morph & non-morph ambigu-ity.
We categorize a morph query as ?Unique?
ifthe string is mainly used as a morph when it oc-curs, such as ???
(Bodu)?
which is used to re-fer to ?Bo Xilai?
; otherwise as ?Common?
(e.g.???
(Baby)?
,???
(President)?
).
Table 10presents the separate scores for these two cate-gories.
We can see that the morphs in ?Unique?1090category have much better resolution performancethan those in ?Common?

We splitthe queries into 5 bins with equal size based on thenon-descending frequency, and evaluate Acc@1separately.

We demon-strated that state-of-the-art alias detection meth-ods did not perform well on morph resolution.
Inthis paper we exploit cross-genre information andsocial correlation to measure semantic similarity.
(Yang et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2012) also showedthe effectiveness of exploiting information fromformal web documents to enhance tweet summa-rization and tweet ranking.Other similar research lines are the TAC-KBPEntity Linking (EL) (Ji et al, 2010; Ji et al, 2011),which links a named entity in news and web docu-ments to an appropriate knowledge base (KB) en-try, the task of mining name translation pairs fromcomparable corpora (Udupa et al, 2009; Ji, 2009;Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng,2004; Hassan et al, 2007) and the link predic-tion problem (Adamic and Adar, 2001; Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2003; Sun et al, 2011b;Hasan et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2007; Sun et al,2011a).
Most of the work focused on unstruc-tured or structured data with clean and rich re-lations (e.g.
DBLP).
In contrast, our work con-structs heterogeneous information networks fromunstructured, noisy multi-genre text without ex-plicit entity attributes.7 Conclusion and Future WorkTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first workof resolving implicit information morphs from thedata under active censorship.
Our promising re-sults can well serve as a benchmark for this newproblem.
Both of the Meta-path based and so-cial correlation based semantic similarity mea-surements are proven powerful and complemen-tary.In this paper we have focused on entity morphs.In the future we will extend our method to dis-cover other types of information morphs, such asevents and nominal mentions.
In addition, auto-matic identification of candidate morphs is anotherchallenging task, especially when the mentions areambiguous and can also refer to other real enti-ties.
Our ongoing work includes identifying can-didate morphs from scratch, as well as discoveringmorphs for a given target based on anomaly anal-ysis and textual coherence modeling.AcknowledgmentsThanks to the three anonymous reviewers for theirinsightful comments.
