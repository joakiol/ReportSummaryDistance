SEMANTIC  MATCHING OFFERS AND JOB SEARCH BETWEEN JOBREQUESTSCOLING 90Jos6 VEGAGSI-ERLI72, Quai des Carri6res94220 CHARENTON (FRANCE)Phone : (1)48 93 81 21, Fax : (1)43 75 79 79The members of the development team were : B Carden, A Chaouachi, B Euzenat, G Klintzing, M Macary, RLeborgne.
We wish to thank the LE MONDE newspaper team for their collaboration during the specification phase.I The primary objective of this system which wasdeveloped for the LE MONDE daily newspaper, is tooffer an efficient tool for a rapid and intelligent jobsearching service to professionals in the context of theever increasing number of advertisements in the printedpress.Traditionally, offers of employment appear innewspapers and magazines and sometimes cover twentypages.
The person in search of employment faces thedaunting t~tsk of daily readings of lists of job offers.the system will propose to the candidate 3 categories ofjob offers :1.- Project manager real time- Project manager in process control- Project manager in automation & industrialcomputing- tlead of process control department.

.This system carries out an optimized comparisonbetween the job offers in the advertisement data base andthe requests and/or curriculum vitae entered by end-usersat their terminals (minitel).
This is performed byextracting pertinent information from the input texts andcomparing it at semantic level with the Knowledge Baseand the data of the indexed offers.3.- Project manager in computingARCHITECTUREThe End-User  In ter faceThe requirements expressed in the job offer shouldresemble as closely as possible the characteristics of thecandidate or at least be semantically close.
Moreprecisely, the results of the matching process aregrouped according to the three following criteria :- the requirements of the position are directly fulfilledby the characteristics of the candidate- the requirements expressed in the job offer are metonly partiallythe job offers require characteristics other than thoseexpressed in the candidate's curriculum vitae, but arein the same semantic field.For example, if the requested position is:( 1 ) 'project manager real time computing',The end-user interface allows the candidate to enter hiscurriculum vitae in natural language 2.Part of the interaction with the candidate concerns theidentification of unknown words (typing errors andspelling mistakes) at which point the system asks theuser to correct his text.
When a user's request does notmatch with any requirements in the job offers data base,the system enters into a dialogue with the candidate inorder to relax or modify the constraints he imposed onthe job search criteria at initial request time.The job offers proposed are assembled into groupsaccording to their semantic pertinence with respect othe candidate's request.Databases1_ This system is in operation since September 89 andcan 'be consulted by Minitel, using telephone number3615 and selecting the LM / EMPLOI service.The system uses linguistic data :2- The user can express his attributes freely and withoutconstraints, contrary to SQL, for example.I67- a general dictionary containing rammatical words,verbs and a certain umber of nouns;- a dictionary specialized in the universe of employment(professions, training, universities, software tools,regions,..);- a Knowledge Base (KB) 3.The conceptual, semantic and pragmatic models of thisapplication are represented in the KB.
This KB describescertain facts which are universal truths and others whichare only true within the context of the universe ofemployment.The job offers and the curriculum vitae of the candidates(or users) have been modelled using the object analogy.Each conceptual object has an associated attribute list(domains) with values which instantiate them.
Thevalues ,of a particular domain are linked together bysemantic and pragmatic relations.
In the same way,relations may exist between values of different domains.For example :POSITIONQua l~ ion  F u ~  B r a n ~/ ~ marketing tradeengl~a~'ee~ Icnnician compu~ oasewhere POSITION is an 9.b.j_e.~.
Qualification, Function,... are the domains.
Marketing, computing .

Moreover, we can see an "upper-level" relationbetween technician & engineer, and a generic termrelation between computing and data base.The al~xl.v.,~,~The sy.,;tem uses morphologic and syntactic analysersand a semantic analysis engine called the "matchingmachine" (MM).The rule sets (see below for further details) andgrammars used by the morphologic and syntacticanalysers in this application were designed to belinguistically robust and rapid in execution.
Given thatthe application was designed for 200 simultaneousMinitell 4 connexions by the response time for theseanalysers must be extremely short.3- The combined size of the two dictionaries isapproximately 30,000 words with 3000 referentialwoIds for the KB.4- This physical architecture consists of a : frontendwhich manages the connexions and serializes the user'squeries, and a backend supporting the analysers.68With regard to questions of morphology, the analyserspossess rule sets describing inflexion and derivation forthe recovery of canonical forms of words 5stocked in thedictionary starting from the text of the user's request orcurriculum vitae.This analyser also possesses rules for treating initialletters (H.E.C.
<==> HEC, CIA <==> C.I.A .

),abbreviations (St6 <==>Soci6t6, m <==> m~tre .
.
.
.
),"floating prefix" terms (micro-informatique <---=>microinformatique <==> micro informatique),concatenated or disjoint expressions (mettre n oeuvre<==> les mesures ~ rapidement ng_q_9.

and other morpho-lexicalphenomena.Concerning syntactic analysis, the correspondinganalyser possesses a grammar of "standard" French.However, phenomena such as anaphora, coreferencing(except in certain minor cases), the scope of negations,among others are not treated.
This is a deliberate choicesince the persons using this system (through theirrequests or curriculum vitae) do not often use theseelements of style in their texts (texts are chiefly nounphrases or verbal sentences).It is important o note that the analysers describedabove 6 are independent of the application and can bereused for other applications.Concerning the text comprehension phase, the MMtreats the information received from the syntacticanalyser in conjunction with information drawn fromthe Knowledge Base.The MM uses functions or "methods" which carry outspecific treatments according to the type of objects underconsideration.How the Matchin~ Machine worksThe functioning of the MM is at the same timesemantic and pragmatic and 4 distinct steps areidentified.
They are :- 1.
Recuperation of normalized terms from the user'srequest or curriculum vitae;-2 .
Identification of the domain and of tile objectconcerned by these terms;-3 .
Semantico-pragmatic spreading from tile initialterms according to the "method" used for their associatedobject.5- For us, canonical words are : a singular, masculinenouns or adjectives, and roots of verbs.6- except some rules used to handle special words like theacronyms, the "telematic language", etc.-4.
Extraction, intersection and classification of theindexed job offers according to the initial terms andthose identified by the spreading process.~qp_._2_serves to unambiguously identify the objectsdesignated by the normalized terms which were extractedfrom the user's request.
For example, in the followingrequest:(2) Expert translator of text in Englishthe analyser will assign the term "English" to thedomain FUNCTION of the object POSITION since thisterm designates, in this context, a specialization withinthe profession of the translator.In contrast, if the request is:(3) Civil engineer spealing Englishin this case, the term "English" will be considered, inthis context, as a value designating an objectLANGUAGE (which is one of the conceptual levelobjects found in the job offers) 7.consists in passing from one term to another,starting at an initial term, in a tree-walk through thesemantic and pragmatic network of the KB.
This isperformed in an outward spreading manner and isdetermined by the methods associated with the objecttypes designated by the initial terms.
The arcs betweenthe nodes of the network are weighted and the result of aspreading process is a new term Y at a distance n from astarting term X.The distance that a spreading process is allowed to runthrough the network is determined by the methods.
Thisdistance is one of the parameters necessary to calculatethe final distance in the following step.is charged with the ordering of the job offers bycomparing initial and final terms.The set.,; of job offers then undergo set operations(boolean operations).
This treatment is directed by anumber of dynamically acting rules.
That is, the actionsof these set operations depend on the semantic roleassigned to the terms during the second step of analysisand the objects concerned by these terms.For example, for the request:(4) Computing journalist7_ Among the examples mentioned here, we couldconsider the following:(6) English translatorGiven that the model does not take nationalities intoaccount, the system will interpret his request as inexample (2).the job offers proposed must correspond to positions forjournalists pecializing in the computing domain andnot to positions in the press and/or informatics.However, in the following example:(5) UNIX / C programmerthe system must propose positions for specialists inUNIX / C. It will also propose job offers for softwareprogrammers in which n__qo mention of operating systemsor programming language is made, and others in whichother operating systems or languages were mentioned.The classification of job offers is made as a function ofthe distance and the criteria fulfilled by the request.
Thejob offers will be presented to the user according to thisclassification (see Example (1)).CONCLUSIONAlthough we use natural language processing as acommunication i terface, we have not neglected thestrong points of 'formatted-screen based dialogue'.Indeed, much emphasis was given to the design phase ofthe ~rg0n0mics ( creen content, fields, messages...) andcinematics (dynamic of screens as a function of theusers' actions) of the application i  order to integrate thebetter aspects of both dialogue modes into the interface.In fact, the experiments we conducted uring thespecification phase demonstrated that, in such anapplication, it is not feasible to present o the user avirtually blank screen containing brief suggestions suchas "Enter your CV" or "Enter a request".As a result we designed the interface to present o theuser fields corresponding to conceptual objets in theknowledge base in which he is allowed to expresshimself without lexical or syntactic restriction.
In thisway the user feels guided through the session withoutbeing constrained toreply to imposed questions.By integrating natural language processing into theapplication we have implemented a new approach toman-machine dialogue in the field of online job offerservices (contrary to the classical arborescent menu-driven interfaces).The choice of combining the advantages of formatted-screen based ialogue and the constraint-free approach ofnatural language text input makes a significant advancetowards the design of effective user-friendly man-machine interfaces.3 69
