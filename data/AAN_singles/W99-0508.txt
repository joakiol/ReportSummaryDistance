JJ,IIParallel Translations as Sense DiscriminatorsNancy IDEDepartment ofComputer ScienceVassar College124 Raymond AvenuePoughkeepsie, NY 12604-0520 USAlde@cs vassar eduAbstractThis article reports the results of aprehmlnary analysis of translationequivalents in four languages from differentlanguage famdles, extracted from an on-hneparallel corpus of George Orwell's NmeteenEighty-Four The goal of the study is todetermine the degree to which translatmnequivalents for different meamngs of apolysemous word In Enghsh are lexlcahzeddifferently across a variety of languages, andto detelmme whether this information can beused to structure or create a set of sensedistinctions useful in natural languageprocessing apphcatmns A coherence Indexis computed that measures the tendency fordifferent senses o1 the same English word tobe lexlcahzed ifferently, and flora this dataa clustering algorithm is used to create sensehierat chlesIntroductionIt ~s well known that the most nagging issue forword sense disamblguanon (WSD) Is thedefinmon of just what a word sense is At itsbase, the problem Is a philosophical andlinguistic one that is far from being resolvedHowever, work in automated languageprocessing has led to effotts to flnd practicalmeans to dlstmgmsh word senses, at least to thedegree that they are useful for natural anguageprocessing tasks such as summarization,document retrieval, and machine translataonSeveral criteria have been suggested andexploited to automatically determine the senseof a word m context (see Ide and V6roms, 1998),including syntactic behavior, semantic andpragmatic knowledge, and especially in morerecent empirical studies, word co-occurrencewithin syntactic relations (e g, Hearst, 1991,Yarowsky, 1993), words co-occurring m globalcontext (e g, Gale et al 1993, Yarowsky, 1992Schutze, 1992, 1993), etc No clear criteria haveemerged, however, and the problem continues toloom large for WSD workThe notion that cross-hngual comparison can beuseful fol sense dlsamblguauon has served as abasis for some recent work on WSD Foiexample, Brown et al(1991)and Gale et al(1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned HansardCorpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates foiWSD, and Dagan et al(1991) and Dagan andItal (1994) used monohngual corpora of Hebrewand German and a bilingual dictionary Thesestudies rely on the assumption that the mappingbetween words and word senses vanessignificantly among languages For example, theword duty in English t~anslates into French asdevoir m ~ts obhgatlon sense, and tmpOt m ~tstax sense By determining the translation52,..--.,.~ -eqmvalent ot duty in a parallel French text, thecorrect sense of the Enghsh word is identifiedThese studies exploit th~s lnformatmn m order togather co-occurrence data for the differentsenses, which ts then used to dtsamb~guate n wtexts In related work, Dywk (1998) usedpatterns of translational relatmns in an Enghsh-Norwegian paralle !
corpus (ENPC, OsloUmverslty) to define semantic propemes uch assynonymy, ambtgmty, vagueness, and semantichelds and suggested a derivation ot- semanticrepresentations for signs (eg ,  lexemes),captunng semantm relatmnshlps such ashyponymy etc, fiom such translatmnal relatmnsRecently,  Resnlk and Yarowsky (1997)suggested that fol the purposes ot WSD, thedifferent senses of a wo~d could be detelmlnedby considering only sense d~stmctmns that arelextcahzed cross-hngmstlcally In particular,they propose that some set of target languagesbe ~dent~fied, and that the sense d~stmctmns tobe considered for language processingappllcatmns and evaluatmn be restricted to thosethat are reahzed lexlcally in some minimumsubset of those languages This idea would seemto p~ovtde an answer, at least m part, to theproblem of determining different senses of aword mtumvely, one assumes that ff anotherlanguage lexlcahzes a word m two or moreways, there must be a conceptual monvatmn Ifwe look at enough languages, we would belikely to fred the s~gmficant lexlcal differencesthat dehmtt different senses of a wordHowever,  th~s suggestmn raises severalquestions Fo~ instance, ~t ~s well known thatmany amb~gumes are preserved acrosslanguages (for example, the French tntdrYt andthe Enghsh interest), especmlly languages thatare relatively closely related Assuming thisproblem can be overcome, should differencesfound m closely related languages be givenlesser (or greater) weight than those found mmore distantly related languages 9 Moregenerally, which languages hould be consideredfor this exermse 9 All languages 9 Closely relatedlanguages9 Languages from different languagefamlhes '~ A mixture of the two 9 How manylanguages, and of which types, would be"enough" to provide adequate lnfotmanon totthis purpose~There ts also the questmn ot the crlterm thatwould be used to estabhsh that a sensedistinction is "lexlcahzed cross-hngu~stmally"How consistent must the d~stlnCtlOn be 9 Does itmean that two concepts are expressed bymutually non-lntetchangeable lexmal items insome slgmficant number ot other languages, orneed tt only be the case that the option ot adifferent lexlcahzatlon exists m a certainpercentage of cases 9Another conslderatmn ts where the cross-hngualmformatlon to answer these questmns wouldcome from Using bdmgual dictionaries wouldbe extremely tedmus and error-prone, g~ven thesubstantial d~vergence among d~ctlonanes interms of the kinds and degree of sensedlstmctmns they make Resmk and Yalowsky(1997) suggest EutoWordNet (Vossen, 1998) asa possible somce of mformatmn, but, given thatEuroWordNet s pttmatdy a lexmon and not acorpus, ~t is subject to many of the sameobjections as for bl-hngual dictionariesAn alternative would be to gather thereformation from parallel, ahgned corpmaUnlike bilingual and muttt-hngual dictionaries,translatmn eqmvalents xn parallel texts a~edetermined by experienced translatols, whoevaluate ach instance ot a word's use m contextrather than as a part of the meta-hngmst~cactlvlty of classifying senses for mclusmn in adictionary However, at present very few parallelahgned corpora exist The vast majority ot theseare bl-texts, mvolwng only two languages, oneof which is very often English Ideally, a serious53evaluation of Resnik and Yarowsky's proposalwould include parallel texts m languages fromseveral different language families, and, tomaximally ensure that the word m question isused in the exact same sense across languages, ~twould be preferable that the same text were usedover all languages in the study The onlycurrently avadable parallel corpora for morethan two languages are Olwell's NmeteenEighty-Four (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), Plato'sRepubhc (Erjavec, et al 1998), the MULTEXTJournal .o/ the Commt.~ston corpus (Ide andV6roms, 1994), and the Bible (Resnlk, et al mpress) It is likely that these corpora do notprovide enough appropriate data to reliablydetermine sense distinctions Also, ~t Is not clearhow the lexlcahzatlon of sense distractionsacross languages I affected by genre, domain,style, etcThls paper attempts to provide some prehmlnaryanswers to the questions outhned above, In orderto eventually determine the degree to which theuse of parallel data ts vmble to determine sensedistinctions, and, ff so, the ways in which th~sreformation might be used Given the lack oflalge parallel texts across multiple languages,the study is necessarily hmlted, however, closeexammanon of a small sample of parallel datacan, as a first step, provide the basis anddlrectmn for more extensive studies1 MethodologyI have conducted a small study using parallel,aligned versmns ot George Orwell's NineteenEtghtv-Fo,lr (Euavec and Ide, 1998)m fivelanguages Enghsh, Slovene, Estonian,Romanlan, and Czech I The study therefoleInvolves languages from four language familiesThe O~well parallel corpus also includes vers|ons o)Ntneteen-E~gho Four m Hungarian, Bulgarmn,Latwan, Llthuaman, Se~bmn, and Russmn(Germanic, Slavic, Fmno-Ugrec, and Romance),two languages from the same family (Czech andSlovene), as well as one non-Indo-Europeanlanguage (Estoman)Nmeteen Eighty-Four Is a text of about 100,000words, translated irectly from the originalEnglish m each of the other languages Theparallel versions of the text are sentence-alignedto the English and tagged for part of speechAlthough Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work offiction, Orwell's prose IS not highly stylized and,as such, it provides a reasonable sample otmodern, ordinary language that ~s not tied to agiven topic or sub-domain (such as newspapers,technical reports, etc ) Furthermore, thetranslations of the text seem to be relativelyfaithful to the original for instance, over 95% otthe sentence alignments in the full pmallelcorpus of seven languages are one-to-one(Prlest-Dorman, etal, 1997)Nine ambiguous English words were consideredhard, head, country, hne, promise, shght, seize,scrap, float The first four were chosen becausethey have been used in other dlsamb~guatlonstudies, the latter five were chosen from amongthe words used m the Senseval dlsamblguatlonexercise (Kllgamff and Palmer, forthcoming) Inall cases, the study was necessarily hmlted towords that occurred frequently enough in theOrwell text to warrant considerationF~ve hundred forty-two sentences conta|nmg anoccurrence or occurrences (Includingmorphological variants) of each of the ninewords were extracted from the Enghsh text,together w~th the parallel sentences m whichthey occur m the texts ot the four comparisonlanguages (Czech, Estonian, Romantan,Slovene) As Walks and Stevenson (1998) havepointed out, pa~t-of-speech taggingaccomplishes a good portion of the work otsemantic dlsamb~guatmn, therefore occmrencesof wolds that appemed in the data in more than54one part of speech were grouped separately 2The Enghsh occurrences were then groupedusmg the sense distinctions m WordNet,(version 1 6) \[Miller et al,  1990, Fellbaum,1998\]) The sense categonzatmn was performedby the author and two student assistants, resultsfrom the three were compared and a final,mutually agreeable set of sense assignmentswas estabhshedFor each of the four comparison languages, thecorpus of sense-grouped parallel sentences weresent to a l lngmst and natl,ve speaker of thecomparison language The hngmsts were askedto provide the lexlcal item m each parallelsentence that corresponds to the ambiguousEnghsh word If inflected, they were asked toprovide both the inflected form and the rootform In addttmn, the lmgmsts were asked toindicate the type of translatmn, according to thedtstmctmns given m Table 1For over 85% of the Enghsh word occurrences(corresponding to types 1 and 2 m Table 1), aspecific lexlcal item or items could be identifiedas the t rans lat ion  equ iva lent  for thecorresponding Enghsh word For comparisonpurposes, each translanon equivalent wasrepresented by ~ts lemma (or the lemma of thetoot form in the case of derivatives) andassociated w~th the WordNet sense to which itcorrespondsIn order to determine the degree to which theassigned sense dlstlncttons correspond totranslation eqmvalents, a coherence index ( Cl)was computed that measures how often each pmrof senses is translated usmg the same word aswell as the consistency with which a g~ven se,ls,z~s translated with the same word ~ Note that thez The adJective and adverb senses of hard areconsadeied together because the distinction is notconsistent across the translations used m the studyNote that the CI ~s similar to semanuc entropy(Melamed, 1997) However, Melamed computesCIs do not determine whether or not a sensedtstmctton can be lextcahzed in the targetlanguage, but only the degree to whmh they arelexicahzed differently m the translated textHowever, tt can be assumed that the CIs providea measure of the tendency to lex~cahze differentWordNet senses differently, which can m turnbe seen as an mdtcatmn of the degree to whichthe distraction ts vahdFor each ambiguous word, the CI Is computedfor each pair of senses, as followsS<q t>Cl (sqS ,  ) = '=1m rnr twhere@ n ~s the number of comparison languagesunder consideration,nl~q and m,, are the nt~mber of occurrences ol-sense sqand sense s~ m the Enghsh corpus,respectively, including occurrences thathave no idenufiable translation,s<~ ~>m ts

with adifferent word m every occurrence, Cl(s, ~) = 0In general, the CI for pans of different sensesprovides an index of thmr relatedness, t e ,  thegreater the value of Cl(s, sj), the more
