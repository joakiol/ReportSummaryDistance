Inversion Transduction Grammar Constraintsfor Mining Parallel Sentences fromQuasi-Comparable CorporaDekai Wu1 and Pascale Fung21 Human Language Technology Center, HKUST,Department of Computer Science2 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering,University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kongdekai@cs.ust.hk, pascale@ee.ust.hkAbstract.
We present a new implication of Wu?s (1997) InversionTransduction Grammar (ITG) Hypothesis, on the problem of retriev-ing truly parallel sentence translations from large collections of highlynon-parallel documents.
Our approach leverages a strong language uni-versal constraint posited by the ITG Hypothesis, that can serve as astrong inductive bias for various language learning problems, resultingin both efficiency and accuracy gains.
The task we attack is highly prac-tical since non-parallel multilingual data exists in far greater quantitiesthan parallel corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful re-source.
Our aim here is to mine truly parallel sentences, as opposed tocomparable sentence pairs or loose translations as in most previous work.The method we introduce exploits Bracketing ITGs to produce the firstknown results for this problem.
Experiments show that it obtains largeaccuracy gains on this task compared to the expected performance ofstate-of-the-art models that were developed for the less stringent task ofmining comparable sentence pairs.1 IntroductionParallel sentences are a relatively scarce but extremely useful resource for manyapplications including cross-lingual retrieval and statistical machine translation.Parallel sentences, or bi-sentences for short, can be exploited for a wealth ofapplications ranging from mining term translations for cross-lingual applications,to training paraphrase models and inducing structured terms for indexing, queryprocessing, and retrieval.Unfortunately, far more is available in the way of monolingual data.
High-quality parallel corpora are currently largely limited to specialized collectionsof government (especially UN) and certain newswire collections, and even thenrelatively few bi-sentences are available in tight sentence-by-sentence translation. This work was supported in part by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council throughgrants RGC6083/99E, RGC6256/00E, DAG03/04.EG09, and RGC6206/03E.R.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005258 D. Wu and P. FungIncreasingly sophisticated methods for extracting loose translations from non-parallel monolingual corpora?and in particular, what have been called com-parable sentence pairs?have also recently become available.
But while loosetranslations by themselves already have numerous applications, truly parallelsentence translations provide invaluable types of information for the aforemen-tioned types of mining and induction, which cannot easily be obtained frommerely loose translations or comparable sentence pairs.
In particular, truly par-allel bi-sentences are especially useful for extracting more precise syntactic andsemantic relations within word sequences.We present a new method that exploits a novel application of InversionTransduction Grammar or ITG expressiveness constraints (Wu 1995 [1], Wu1997 [2]) for mining monolingual data to obtain tight sentence translation pairs,yielding accuracy significantly higher than previous known methods.
We focushere on very non-parallel quasi-comparable monolingual corpora, which are avail-able in far larger quantities but are significantly more difficult to mine than eithernoisy parallel corpora or comparable corpora.
The majority of previous work hasconcerned noisy parallel corpora (sometimes imprecisely also called ?compara-ble corpora?
), which contain non-aligned sentences that are nevertheless mostlybilingual translations of the same document.
More recent work has examinedcomparable corpora, which contain non-sentence-aligned, non-translated bilin-gual documents that are topic-aligned.
Still relatively few methods attempt tomine quasi-comparable corpora, which contain far more heterogeneous, very non-parallel bilingual documents that could be either on the same topic (in-topic) ornot (off-topic).Our approach is motivated by a number of desirable characteristics of ITGs,which historically were developed for translation and alignment purposes, ratherthan mining applications of the kind discussed in this paper.
The ITG Hypothesisposits a strong language universal constraint that can act as a strong inductivebias for various language learning problems, resulting in both efficiency and accu-racy gains.
Specifically, the hypothesis asserts that sentence translation betweenany two natural languages can be accomplished within ITG expressiveness (sub-ject to certain conditions).
So-called Bracketing ITGs (BITG) are particularlyinteresting in certain applications such as the problem we consider here, becausethey impose ITG constraints in language-independent fashion, and do not re-quire any language-specific linguistic grammar.
(As discussed below, BracketingITGs are the simplest form of ITGs, where the grammar uses only a single,undifferentiated non-terminal.
)The key modeling property of bracketing ITGs that is most relevant to thetask of identifying parallel bi-sentences is that they assign strong preference tocandidate sentence pairs in which nested constituent subtrees can be recursivelyaligned with a minimum of constituent boundary violations.
Unlike language-specific linguistic approaches, however, the shape of the trees are driven in un-supervised fashion by the data.
One way to view this is that the trees are hid-den explanatory variables.
This not only provides significantly higher robustnessthan more highly constrained manually constructed grammars, but also makesInversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences 259the model widely applicable across languages in economical fashion without alarge investment in manually constructed resources.Moreover, for reasons discussed by Wu [2], ITGs possess an interesting in-trinsic combinatorial property of permitting roughly up to four arguments of anyframe to be transposed freely, but not more.
This matches suprisingly closely thepreponderance of linguistic verb frame theories from diverse linguistic traditionsthat all allow up to four arguments per frame.
Again, this property falls naturallyout of ITGs in language-independent fashion, without any hardcoded language-specific knowledge.
This further suggests that ITGs should do well at picking outtranslation pairs where the order of up to four arguments per frame may varyfreely between the two languages.
Conversely, ITGs should do well at rejectingcandidates where (1) too many words in one sentence find no correspondence inthe other, (2) frames do not nest in similar ways in the candidate sentence pair,or (3) too many arguments must be transposed to achieve an alignment?all ofwhich would suggest that the sentences probably express different ideas.Various forms of empirical confirmation for the ITG Hypothesis have emergedrecently, which quantitatively support the qualitative cross-linguistic character-istics just described across a variety of language pairs and tasks.
Zens and Ney(2003) [3] show that ITG constraints yield significantly better alignment coveragethan the constraints used in IBM statistical machine translation models on bothGerman-English (Verbmobil corpus) and French-English (Canadian Hansardscorpus).
Zhang and Gildea (2004) [4] found that unsupervised alignment usingBracketing ITGs produces significantly lower Chinese-English alignment errorrates than a syntactically supervised tree-to-string model [5].
Zhang and Gildea(2005) [6] show that lexicalized ITGs can further improve alignment accuracy.With regard to translation rather than alignment accuracy, Zens et al (2004)[7] show that decoding under ITG constraints yields significantly lower worderror rates and BLEU scores than the IBM constraints.
Chiang (2005) [8] ob-tains significant BLEU score improvements via unsupervised induction of hi-erarchical phrasal bracketing ITGs.
Such results partly motivate the work wediscuss here.We will begin by surveying recent related work and reviewing the formalproperties of ITGs.
Subsequently we describe the architecture of our newmethod, which relies on multiple stages so as to balance efficiency and accuracyconsiderations.
Finally we discuss experimental results on a quasi-comparablecorpus of Chinese and English from the topic detection task.2 Recent Approaches to Mining Non-parallel CorporaRecent work (Fung and Cheung 2004 [9]; Munteanu et al 2004 [10]; Zhao andVogel 2002 [11]) on extracting bi-sentences from comparable corpora is largelybased on finding on-topic documents first through similarity matching and timealignment.However, Zhao and Vogel used a corpus of Chinese and English versions ofnews stories from the Xinhua News agency, with ?roughly similar sentence order260 D. Wu and P. Fungof content?.
This corpus can be more accurately described as a noisy parallel cor-pus.
Munteanu et al used comparable corpora of news articles published withinthe same 5-day window.
In both cases, the corpora contain documents on thesame matching topics; unlike our present objective of mining quasi-comparablecorpora, these other methods assume corpora of on-topic documents.Munteanu et al first identify on-topic document pairs by looking at publicationdate and word overlap, then classify all sentence pairs as being parallel or not par-allel, using a maximum entropy classifier trained on parallel corpora.
In contrast,the method we will propose identifies candidate sentence pairs without assumingthat publication date information is available, and then uses the ITG constraintsto automatically find parallel sentence pairs without requiring any training.It is also difficult to relate Munteanu et al?s work to our present objectivebecause they do not directly evaluate the quality of the extracted bi-sentences(they instead look at performance of their machine translation application);however, as with Fung and Cheung, they noted that the sentences extractedwere not truly parallel on the whole.In this work, we aim to find parallel sentences from much more heterogenous,very non-parallel quasi-comparable corpora.
Since many more multilingual textcollections available today contain documents that do not match documentsin the other language, we propose finding more parallel sentences from off-topicdocuments, as well as on-topic documents.
An example is the TDT corpus, whichis an aggregation of multiple news sources from different time periods.3 Inversion Transduction GrammarsFormally, within the expressiveness hierarchy of transduction grammars, theITG level of expressiveness has highly unusual intrinsic properties as seen inFigure 1.
Wu [2] showed that the ITG class is an equivalence class of subsetsof syntax-directed transduction grammars or SDTGs (Lewis and Stearns 1968[12]), equivalently defined by meeting any of the following three conditions: (1) allrules are of rank 2, (2) all rules are of rank 3, or (3) all rules are either of straightor inverted orientation (and may have any rank).
Ordinary unrestricted SDTGsallow any permutation of the symbols on the right-hand side to be specified whentranslating from the input language to the output language.
In contrast, ITGsonly allow two out of the possible permutations.
If a rule is straight, the order ofits right-hand symbols must be the same for both languages (just as in a simpleSDTG or SSDTG).
On the other hand, if a rule is inverted, then the order is left-to-right for the input language and right-to-left for the output language.
Sinceinversion is permitted at any level of rule expansion, a derivation may intermixproductions of either orientation within the parse tree.
The ability to composemultiple levels of straight and inverted constituents gives ITGs much greaterexpressiveness than might seem at first blush, as indicated by the growing bodyof empirical results mentioned earlier.A simple example may be useful to fix ideas.
Consider the following pair ofparse trees for sentence translations:Inversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences 261Fig.
1.
The ITG level of expressiveness constitutes a surprisingly broad equivalence classwithin the expressiveness hierarchy of transduction grammars.
The simple monolingualnotion of ?context-free?
is too coarse to adequately categorize the bilingual case of trans-duction grammars.
The expressiveness of a transduction grammar depends on the max-imum rank k of rules, i.e., the maximum number of nonterminals on the right-hand-side.SDTG-k is always more expressive than SDTG-(k-1), except for the special case of theITG class which includes both SDTG-2 and SDTG-3.
In contrast, for monolingual CFGs,expressiveness is not affected by rank, as shown by the existence of a binary Chomskynormal form for any CFG.
A binary normal form exists for ITGs but not SDTGs.

]S[[[]NP[ [[ [[[ ]NN]NNN]NP]PP[]VV]VP]VP]SP]SEven though the order of constituents under the inner VP is inverted betweenthe languages, an ITG can capture the common structure of the two sentences.This is compactly shown by writing the parse tree together for both sentenceswith the aid of an ??

Following the standard convention, we use a and bto denote probabilities for syntactic and lexical rules, respectively.
For example,the probability of the rule NN0.4?
[A N] is aNN?
[A N] = 0.4.

Wu and P. FungFor present purposes we can employ the special case of Bracketing ITGs,where the grammar employs only one single, undistinguished ?dummy?
nonter-minal category for any non-lexical rule.
Designating this category A, a BracketingITG has the following form (where, as usual, lexical transductions of the formA ?

ei/fjBroadly speaking, Bracketing ITGs are useful when we wish to make use ofthe structural properties of ITGs discussed above, without requiring any addi-tional linguistic information as constraints.
Since they lack differentiated syn-tactic categories, Bracketing ITGs merely constrain the shape of the trees thatalign various nested portions of a sentence pair.
The only linguistic knowledgeused in Bracketing ITGs is the purely lexical set of collocation translations.Nevertheless, the ITG Hypothesis implies that biparsing truly parallel sentencepairs with a Bracketing ITG should typically yield high scores.
Conversely, somenon-parallel sentence pairs could be ITG-alignable, but any significant departureviolating constituent boundaries will be downgraded.As an illustrative example, in the models employed by most previous workon mining bi-sentences from non-parallel corpora, the following pair of sentences(found in actual data arising in our experiments below) would receive an inap-propriately high score, because of the high lexical similarity between the twosentences:Chinese president Jiang Zemin arrived in Japan today for a landmark state visit .            (Jiang Zemin will be the first Chinese national president to pay a state vist toJapan.
)However, the ITG based model is sensitive enough to the differences in theconstituent structure (reflecting underlying differences in the predicate argumentstructure) so that our experiments show that it assigns a low score.
On theother hand, the experiments also show that it successfully assigns a high scoreto other candidate bi-sentences representing a true Chinese translation of thesame English sentence, as well as a true English translation of the same Chinesesentence.4 Candidate GenerationAn extremely large set of pairs of monolingual sentences from the quasi-comparable monolingual corpora will need to be scanned to obtain a usefulMInversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences 263Fig.

Candidate generation overview.
The iterative bootstrapping algorithm firstmines loosely parallel sentence pairs from quasi-comparable corpora that contain bothon-topic and off-topic documents.
In a preprocessing step, documents that are believedto be on the same topic according to their similarity score are extracted, then ?parallel?pairs are mined from these matched documents.
The extracted sentences are used tobootstrap the entire process iteratively in two ways: (1) they are used to update abilingual lexicon, which is then used again to reprocess the documents to be matchedagain; (2) any document pairs that are found to contain at least one ?parallel?
sentencepairs are considered to be on-topic, and added to the matched document set.
Notethat step (2) adds to the on-topic document set certain document pairs that are notconsidered to be on-topic by document matching scores.number of parallel sentences, since obviously, the overwhelming majority of then2 possible sentence pairs will not be parallel.
It is infeasible to run the ITGbiparsing algorithm on n2 candidate sentence pairs.
Therefore a multi-stage al-gorithm is needed that first generates likely candidates using faster heuristics,and then biparses the candidates to obtain the final high-precision results.We base our candidate generation on a method that Fung and Cheung (2004)developed for extracting loose translations (comparable sentence pairs) fromquasi-comparable corpora [9], as shown in Figure 2.
We selected this modelbecause it produces the highest known accuracy on that task.Figure 3 outlines the algorithm in greater detail.
In the following sections, wedescribe the document pre-processing step followed by each of the subsequentiterative steps of the algorithm.264 D. Wu and P. Fung1.

Candidate generation algorithmDocument preprocessing.
The documents are word segmented with the LinguisticData Consortium (LDC) Chinese-English dictionary 2.0.
The Chinese documentis then glossed using all the dictionary entries.
When a Chinese word has multiplepossible translations in English, it is disambiguated using an extension of Funget al?s (1999) method [13].Initial document matching.
The aim of this step is to roughly match the Chinese-English documents pairs that are on-topic, in order to extract parallel sentencesfrom them.
Following previous work, cosine similarity between document vectorsis used to judge whether a bilingual document pair is on-topic or off-topic.Both the glossed Chinese document and English are represented in wordvectors, with term weights.
Pair-wise similarities are calculated for all possibleChinese-English document pairs, and bilingual documents with similarities abovea certain threshold are considered to be comparable.
Comparable documents areoften on-topic.Sentence matching.
All sentence pair combinations within the on-topic docu-ments are considered next in the selection process.
Each sentence is again rep-resented as word vectors.
For each extracted document pair, pair-wise cosinesimilarities are calculated for all possible Chinese-English sentence pairs.
Sen-tence pairs above a set threshold are considered parallel and extracted from thedocuments.
Since cosine similarity is computed on translated word pairs withinthe sentence pairs, the better our bilingual lexicon is, the more accurate thesentence similarity will be.
In the following section, we discuss how to find newword translations.Inversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences 265EM lexical learning from matched sentence pairs.
This step updates the bilinguallexicon according to the intermediate results of parallel sentence extraction.
Newbilingual word pairs are learned from the extracted sentence pairs based on anEM learning method.
In our experience any common method can be used for thispurpose; for the experiments below we used the GIZA++ [14] implementationof the IBM statistical translation lexicon Model 4 of Brown et al (1993) [15].This model is based on the conditional probability of a source word beinggenerated by the target word in the other language, based on EM estimationfrom aligned sentences.
Zhao and Vogel (2002) showed that this model lendsitself to adaptation and can provide better vocabulary coverage and better sen-tence alignment probability estimation [11].
In our work, we use this model onthe intermediate results of parallel sentence extraction, i.e., on a set of alignedsentence pairs that may or may not truly correspond to each other.We found that sentence pairs with high alignment scores are not necessarilymore similar than others.
This might be due to the fact that EM estimationat each intermediate step is not reliable, since we only have a small amount ofaligned sentences that are truly parallel.
The EM learner is therefore weak whenapplied to bilingual sentences from very non-parallel quasi-comparable corpora.Document re-matching.
This step implements a ?find-one-get-more?
principle,by augmenting the earlier matched documents with document pairs that arefound to contain at least one parallel sentence pair.
We further find other doc-uments that are similar to each of the monolingual documents found.
The algo-rithm then iterates to refine document matching and parallel sentence extraction.Convergence.
The IBM model parameters, including sentence alignment scoreand word alignment scores, are computed in each iteration.
The parameter valueseventually stay unchanged and the set of extracted bi-sentence candidates alsoconverges to a fixed size.
The iteration then terminates and returns the last setof bilingual sentence pairs as the generated candidate sentences.5 ITG ScoringThe ITG model computes scores upon the set of candidates generated in thepreceding stage.
A variant of the approach used by Leusch et al (2003) [16]allows us to forego training to estimate true probabilities; instead, rules aresimply given unit weights.
This allows the scores computed by ITG biparsing tobe interpreted as a generalization of classical Levenshtein string edit distance,where inverted block transpositions are also allowed.
Even without probabilityestimation, Leusch et al found excellent correlation with human judgment ofsimilarity between translated paraphrases.As mentioned earlier, biparsing for ITGs can be accomplished efficiently inpolynomial time, rather than the exponential time required for classical SDTGs.The biparsing algorithm employs a dynamic programming approach describedby Wu [2].
The time complexity of the algorithm in the general case is ?
(T 3V 3)where T and V are the lengths of the two sentences.
This is a factor of V 3 more266 D. Wu and P. Fungthan monolingual chart parsing, but has turned out to remain quite practicalfor corpus analysis, where parsing need not be real-time.6 ExperimentsMethod.
For our experiments we extracted the bi-sentences from a very non-parallel, quasi-comparable corpus of TDT3 data which consists of transcriptionsof news stories from radio and TV broadcasts in both English and Chinese chan-nels during the period 1998-2000.
This corpus contained approximately 290,000English sentences and 110,000 Chinese sentences.
This yields over 30 billionpossible sentence pairs, so a multi-stage approach is clearly necessary.Experience showed that the lexicon learned in the candidate generation stage,while adequate for candidate generation, is not of sufficient quality for biparsingdue to the non-parallel nature of the training data.
However, any translationlexicon of reasonable accuracy can be used.
For these experiments we employedthe LDC Chinese-English dictionary 2.0.To conduct as blind an evaluation as possible, an independent annotatorseparately produced gold standard labels for a random sample of approximately300 of the top 2,500 candidate sentence pairs proposed by the generation stage.The annotator was instructed to accept any semantically equivalent translations,including non-literal ones.
Inspection had shown that sentence pair candidateslonger than about 15 words were practically never truly parallel translations,so these were a priori excluded by the sampling in order to ensure that preci-sion/recall scores would be more meaningful.Results.
Under our method any desired tradeoff between precision and recallcan be obtained.
Therefore, rather than arbitrarily setting a threshold, we areinterested in evaluation metrics that can show whether the ITG model is highlyeffective at any desired tradeoff points.
Thus, we assess the contribution of ITGranking by computing standard uninterpolated average precision scores used toevaluate the effectiveness of ranking methods.
Specifically, in this case, this isthe expected value of precision over the rank positions of the correctly identifiedtruly parallel bi-sentences:uninterpolated average precision =1| T |?i?Tprecision at rank (i) (1)where T is the set of correctly identified bi-sentences.Our method yielded an uninterpolated average precision of 64.7%.
No di-rect comparison of this figure is possible since previous work has focused onthe rather different objectives of mining noisy parallel or comparable corporato extract comparable sentence pairs and loose translations.
However, we canunderstand the improvement by comparing against scores obtained using thecosine-based lexical similarity metric which is typical of the majority of previ-ous methods for mining non-parallel corpora, including that of Fung and Cheung(2004)[9].
Evaluating the ranking produced under this more typical score yieldedInversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences 267Fig.

Precision-recall curves for the ITG model (upper curve) versus traditional cosinemodel (lower curve); see textan uninterpolated average precision of 24.6%.
This suggests that the ITG basedmethod could produce significant accuracy gains if applied to many of the ex-isting non-parallel corpus mining methods.Figure 4 compares precision versus recall curves obtained with rankings fromthe ITG model compared with the more traditional cosine lexical similaritymodel.
The graph reveals that at all levels, much higher precision can be obtainedusing the ITG model.
Up to 20% recall, the ITG ranking produces bi-sentenceswith perfect precision; in contrast, the cosine model produces 30% precision.Even at 50% recall, the ITG ranked bi-sentences have above 65% precision, ascompared with 21% for the cosine model.As can be seen from the following examples of extracted bi-sentences (shownwith rough word glosses), the ITG constraints are able to accommodate nestedinversions accounting for the cross-linguistic differences in constituent order:7 ConclusionWe have introduced a new method that exploits generic bracketing InversionTransduction Grammars giving the first known results for the new task of min-ing truly parallel sentences from very non-parallel quasi-comparable corpora.It is time to break the silence.?

)268 D. Wu and P. FungThe method takes the strong language universal constraint posited by the ITGHypothesis as an inductive bias on the bi-sentence extraction task which weanticipate will become a key stage in unsupervised learning for numerous morespecific models.
Experiments show that the method obtains large accuracy gainson this task compared to the performance that could be expected if state-of-the-art models for the less stringent task of mining comparable sentence pairs wereapplied to this task instead.
From a practical standpoint, the method has thedual advantages of neither requiring expensive training nor requiring language-specific grammatical resources, while producing high accuracy results.References1.
