The underlyingidea is that each synset is augmented withits temporal connotation.
For that purpose,temporal classifiers are iteratively learnedfrom an initial set of time-sensitive synsetsand different propagation strategies to giverise to different TempoWordNets.1 IntroductionTemporality has recently received increased at-tention in Natural Language Processing (NLP)and Information Retrieval (IR).
Initial works havebeen proposed in NLP and are exhaustively sum-marized in (Mani et al., 2005).
More recently,the introduction of the TempEval task (Verhagenet al., 2009) in the Semantic Evaluation workshopseries has clearly established the importance oftime to deal with different NLP tasks.
The ulti-mate aim of research in this area is the automaticidentification of temporal expressions (timexes),events and temporal relations within a text in theTimeML format (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).In IR, the time dimension has also received par-ticular attention for the past few years.
Accord-ing to (Metzger, 2007), time is one of the key fiveaspects that determine a document credibility be-sides relevance, accuracy, objectivity and cover-age.
So, the value of information or its quality isintrinsically time-dependent.
As a consequence, anew reasearch field called Temporal InformationRetrieval (T-IR) has emerged (Alonso et al., 2011)and deals with all classical IR tasks such as crawl-ing (Kulkarni et al., 2011), indexing (Anand et al.,2012) or ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011) from thetime viewpoint.However, both NLP and IR evidence the lackof temporal lexical resources.
For example, auto-matic temporal ordering of events in text is usu-ally performed via various linguistic mechanismsincluding the use of time expressions such as ?be-fore?,?after?
or ?during?
that explicitly assert atemporal relation.
In particular, (Derczynski andGaizauskas, 2012) investigate the role of tempo-ral signals in temporal relation extraction over theTimeBank annotated corpus.
However, the list ofsuch expressions is limited.
From the IR view-point, most methodologies rely on the presence ofexplicit timexes and hardly bridge the gap whenno explicit mention of time is available.
One re-cent exception is proposed in (Jatowt et al., 2013)where text time-tagging is seen as a classificationtask, but no use of specific temporal clues is intro-duced or proposed.Inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-tiani, 2006), we propose to introduce the tempo-ral connotation of each synset in WordNet (Miller,1995) by iteratively learning temporal classifiersfrom an initial set of time-sensitive synsets and agiven propagation strategy.
As such, each synsetis automatically time-tagged with four dimensionsi.e.
atemporal, past, present and future, thus giv-ing rise to different TempoWordNets dependingon the propagation strategy.TempoWordNets are evaluated both manuallyand automatically.
First, results show that man-ual annotation of time-tagged synsets is a hardtask for humans.
Second, automatic evaluationbased on sentence temporal classification showsthat the introduction of time-augmented lexicalknowledge bases (TempoWordNets) allows 3.9%improvements of F1-measure against the vectorspace model representation and 4.2% against thesemantic vector space model obtained with the ex-isting WordNet time subtree.2 Related WorkA great deal of works have been proposed in tem-poral NLP.
Most recent studies have been devel-oped in the context of the TempEval evaluationcontests, which were initiated by (Verhagen et al.,62007).
TempEval was initially divided into threechallenges: (A) identifying temporal relations be-tween events and time expressions, (B) identifyingtemporal relations between events and the docu-ment creation time and (C) identifying the tem-poral relations between contiguous pairs of matrixverbs.
In TempEval-2 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen,2009), the best performing systems were basedon conditional random fields mixed with parsingmethodologies (UzZaman and Allen, 2010).
Morerecently, in TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013),new systems have been performing at high levelof performance for all three tasks such as therule-based multilingual temporal tagger Heidel-time (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013).
In IR, the workof (Baeza-Yates, 2005) defines the foundations ofT-IR.
Since, research have been tackling severaltopics such as query understanding (Metzler et al.,2009), temporal snippets generation (Alonso et al.,2007), temporal ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011),temporal clustering (Alonso et al., 2009), futureretrieval (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013) or tempo-ral image retrieval (Dias et al., 2012).As expressed in (Str?otgen and Gertz, 2013),time taggers usually contain pattern files withwords and phrases, which are typically used toexpress temporal expressions in a given language(e.g.
names of months).
In fact, most temporalNLP tasks rely on a time-sensitive vocabulary.
Onthe contrary, T-IR systems usually do not use in-formation about time in language although theycould benefit from it when facing the recurrentproblem of missing explicit timexes.WordNet is a good place to start to find time-sensitive concepts.
Indeed, one can list a setof 21 temporal synsets by iteratively followingthe hyponym relation from the concept of time(synset # 00028270) represented by the follow-ing gloss: the continuum of experience in whichevents pass from the future through the present tothe past.
However, likewise the tennis problem ev-idenced in (Fellbaum, 1998), most temporal wordsare not under the concept of time.
For example,concepts such as ?prediction?, ?remember?, ?an-cient?
or ?fresh?
clearly have a time dimension al-though they are not listed under the time subtreeof WordNet.
Based on the intial ideas of (Moensand Steedman, 1987) on temporal ontologies andinspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani,2006), we propose to enrich all WordNet synsetswith their temporal connotation.3 TempoWordNet as SentiWordNetIn (Dias et al., 2014), we first proposed to buildTempoWordNet based on the idea of (Esuli andSebastiani, 2006) for SentiWordNet.
Each synsetis automatically time-tagged with four dimensionsi.e.
atemporal, past, present and future by per-forming a two-step process.A first temporal classifier is built based on a setof manually selected seed synsets and their corre-sponding glosses tagged as past, present and fu-ture.
This process is then iterated based on therepetitive lexico-semantic expansion1of the initialseeds lists until cross-validation accuracy drops.This first step results in a three-class temporalclassifier and an expanded list of temporal synsetcandidates.A second temporal classifier is then learned totime-tag synsets as atemporal or temporal.
Thisprocess is obtained by taking the final list of ex-panded seed synsets from the previous learningproblem and randomly choosing a balanced num-ber atemporal synsets.
A 10-fold cross-validationis then used to learn the model.TempoWordNet is finally obtained by (1) classi-fying all WordNet synsets as atemporal or tempo-ral with the second classifier and (2) the resultingtemporal synsets are tagged as past, present andfuture by the first classifier.
This step is detailed in(Dias et al., 2014) and all materials can be foundat http://tempowordnet.greyc.fr.4 Diversified Expansion StrategiesThe initial strategy proposed in the previous sec-tion evidences a clear lack.
As the expansion pro-cess is semantically driven, the temporal conno-tation is highly depend on the initial seeds listsand as a consequence may not spread over a widerange of concepts in WordNet.
As such, we pro-pose two different strategies of expansion: (1) theprobabilistic expansion and (2) the hybrid (proba-bilistic combined with semantic) expansion.Probabilistic Expansion: We first learn a tem-poral vs. atemporal classifier based on the ini-tial hand-crafted set of seeds proposed in (Diaset al., 2014).
In particular, the seeds defined aspast, present and future are markers of temporal-ity, while the list of atemporal synsets is the ob-vious counterpart.
Based on this list of tempo-1Only exisiting lexico-semantic links inWordNet are usedto propagate the temporal connotation.7ral and atemporal synsets, a 10-fold cross vali-dation process is performed to learn the temporalvs.
atemporal model, which is used to time-tagthe whole WordNet.
The synsets (or glosses) withhighest temporal and atemporal values in Word-Net are then used for the expansion process of theseeds lists.
The process is iteratively performedand stops when accuracy drops.After building the temporal vs. atemporal clas-sifier, WordNet is divided into two subsets: tem-poral synsets and atemporal ones.
In order tofine tune the temporal part of WordNet, we learna three-class classifier (i.e.
past, present and fu-ture) based on the initial past, present and futureseeds lists and the probabilistic expansion exclu-sively2within the temporal part of WordNet.
So, a10-fold cross validation process is iteratively per-formed until accuracy drops.The results of the probabilistic expansion arepresented in Table 1 and Table 2, when the expan-sion is based on the maximum probability value3.Steps 1 2 3Precision 87.3 100 100Recall 86.7 100 100F1-measure 86.9 100 100Table 1: Cross validation for temporal vs. atem-poral at each iteration.

Probabilistic Expansion.Note that in our experiment, Support VectorMachines (SVM) with a linear kernel4over thevector space model representation of the synsets(i.e.
each synset is represented by its gloss en-coded as a vector of unigrams weighted by theirfrequency) have been used to classify all thesynsets of WordNet.
The results show that in bothcases the expansion process stops at iteration 2.2Only temporal synsets are classified as past, present orfuture and used for the expansion process.
Note that unbal-anced sets can be formed.3That means that all the synsets getting the highest valueproduced by the classifier are used to expand the initial seedslists.4We used theWeka implementation SMOwith default pa-rameters.Hybrid Expansion: Choosing synsets fromWordNet with highest probability assigned by aclassifier learned on the glosses of initial seedslists can lead to the well-known semantic shiftproblem.
So, the idea of the hybrid expansionis to control the expansion process so that themost probable time-sensitive synsets are also cho-sen based on their semantic distance with the ex-panded seed synsets at the previous iteration.
Theprocess is straightforward when compared to theprobabilistic expansion.First, a two-class (temporal vs. atemporal) textclassifier is trained based on the glosses of eachsynsets contained in the initial seed lists to clas-sify all the synsets of WordNet.
Thereafter, Word-Net synsets with highest probability are selected ascandidates for expansion.
From these candidates,only the ones that present the maximum seman-tic similarity to the previous seeds lists are cho-sen for expansion.
Note that the semantic simi-larity is calculated between the candidate synsetand all synsets in the previous expanded seedslists.
Once candidates for expansion have beenchosen, a 10-fold cross validation process is itera-tively performed until accuracy becomes steady.Second, a three-class (past, present and fu-ture) classifier is learned over the temporal part ofWordNet with the hybrid expansion process in thesame exact manner as explained for the previousprobabilistic expansion.
Results for the expansionprocess are presented in the Table 3 and Table 4for the same experimental setups as for the prob-abilistic expansion and using the (Leacock et al.,1998) semantic similarity measure5.Steps 1 2 ... 25 26 27Precision 87.3 94.1 ... 96.0 97.2 96.6Recall 86.7 93.2 ... 95.5 97.0 96.3F1-measure 86.9 93.6 ... 95.7 97.1 96.4Table 3: Cross validation for temporal vs. atem-poral at each iteration.

Balanced corpus:346 sentences for past, 346 sentences for present and 346 sentences for future.Evaluation: In order to intrinsically evaluatethe time-tagged WordNets (TempoWordNets), wefirst performed an inter-annotation process oversamples of 50 automatically time-tagged Word-Net synsets.
In particular, three different anno-tators were presented with temporal synsets andtheir respective glosses, and had to decide upontheir correct classification (temporal vs. atempo-ral).
The results of the multirater agreement eval-uation are presented in Table 6.
In particular, weprocessed the free-marginal multirater kappa val-ues (Randolph, 2005) and the fixed-marginal mul-tirater kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as nobias is present in the data.

0.5199 0.5199 0.4399Table 6: Inter-annotator agreement.These results evidence the difficulty of the taskfor humans as they do not agree on a great deal ofdecisions.
This is particularly due to the fact thatthe temporal dimension of synsets is judged upontheir glosses and not directly on their inherent con-cept.
For example, ?dinosaur?
can be classified astemporal or atemporal as its gloss any of numer-ous extinct terrestrial reptiles of the Mesozoic eraallows both interpretations.So, we performed a new experiment based onthose examples where human annotator agreementwas 100%.
From this dataset, we performed aninter-annotator agreement process with four an-notators (three human annotators plus the classi-fier).
The underlying idea is to understand to whatextent the built TempoWordNets comply with the?easy?
cases.

cases.5 Sentence Temporal ClassificationIn order to evaluate TempoWordNets, we pro-posed to test their capability to enhance the exter-nal task of sentence temporal classification.
Forthat purpose, we used the corpus developed by(Dias et al., 2014), which contains 1455 sen-tences distributed as follows: 724 for past, 385for present and 346 for future.
Different sentencerepresentations have been used.
First, we pro-posed to represent each sentence with the classi-cal vector space model using the tf.idf weightingscheme for unigrams without stop-words removal(Uni.+SW).
Then, we proposed a semantic vectorspace representation where each sentence is aug-mented with the synonyms of any temporal wordcontained in it.
In particular, we proposed thatthe words were matched directly from the Word-Net time subtree (Uni.+SW+Wn) or from Tem-poWordNet (Uni.+SW+TWnL, Uni.+SW+TWnPand Uni.+SW+TWnH) and weighted with tf.idf.The results of our experiments are reported in Ta-ble 5.
The results evidence that the WordNet timesubtree does not embody enough time-related in-formation and the process of automatically time-tagging WordNet can improve the task of sentencetemporal classification, especially with the proba-bilistic or the hybrid expansion.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we proposed the first steps towardsthe automatic construction of temporal ontologies.In particular, we presented and evaluated differentpropagation strategies to time tag WordNet givingrise to different TempoWordNets.
First results arepromising and we deeply believe that such a re-source can be important for time related applica-tions both in NLP and IR.
