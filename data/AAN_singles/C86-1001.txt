Lexicon - Grarar~arThe Representat ion of Compound WordsMaurice GrossUnivers i ty Paris 7I_aboratoire Documentaire ot Linguistigue 12, place Jussieu1-"-75221 Paris CEDEX 05The essenti~d feature of a lexicon-grammar is that the elementaryunit of computation and storage is the simple sentence:snbleet-verb-complement(s).
-this type of representation is obviouslyneeded for verbs: limiting a verb to its shape has no meaning otherthan typographic, ~ir\]ce a verb cannot be separated from its subject andessential coreplemenl(s) 2.
We have shown (M, Gross 1975) that given averb, Or equivalently a simple sentence, the set of syntactic propertiesthat describes its variations is unique: in general, no ether verb hasan identical syntactic paradigm 3.
As a consequence, the properties ofeach verbal construction must be represented in a texicon--grammar.
Thelexicon has no significance taken as an isolated component and thegr~rnmar tempera:at, viewed as independent of the lexicon, will have to bel imited to certain complex sentences,Since be-Adiective tetras are close to verbs, theirdescription is quite similar, that is, they are considered as sentences.We have apl}lied lexicon-grammar representation not only to the twoobvious predicative parts of speech, verb and adjective, but to nounsand adverbs a~; well.
In the same way as one adjoins the verb to betn adjectives, we have ~ystematically introduced support verbs(Vsup) for nouns and adverbs, as in the following examples(Z.S, Harr is  1976, M. Gross 1982, 1986):Vsup ::: fO be Prep:The text ia in contradiction with the lowVSUp =: to h~veThis text has a certain importance for Bob 4Vsup =: tO occur, etc.Accident8 occur at randomThe ~4ccident (was, happened, occurred, took place) late atnight~.-'UA--8~I;'Ot-~I;RS.-This research has been partly financed by contract"P\[\]C Informatique LinggisUque" 1985-86 from the Ministry of Research.2.
The notion of essential complement has been refined through thesystematic study of 12,000 verbs of French (M. Gross 1975; J,-P. Boons,A.
Gaillet, C. Locl~re 19YGa, 1976b, 1987) and a study of adverbials,that is, of nonessential complements (M. Gross 19~6).
The subjectarKI/or the con'lplements may be transformed and/or omitted through varioussyntactic operations, in particular, by nominalizing the verb (G. Gross,R.
Vivbs 198E;), but the full information can be recovered(Z.S.
Harr is  1982).3.
A l ine of '~+'" and "" ' "  marks in FiGure 1 is such a paradigm.4.
Both examples are not isolated entries of the lexicon=grammar, butrather  (Z,S, Harr is  1964), t ransforms of other  forms:fhJ~ text <::ontradi/.
;ta the lawThis text is important for Bob$apport verbs are frequerd in technical texts, and may have stylisticvariants, as in this last example,Grammatical elements such as determiners, prepositions andconjunctions, do not belong to the lexicon-grammar in the same sense asthe four major parts of speech do, siece they are parts ot structures orrules.
For example, prepositions appear in the columns ef thelexicon-grammar.An early representation of verbs in a lexicon-grammar of about12,000 verbs is ftiven in figure t. Each row of the matrix is an entrywhose main construction is defined by a table or class code.
In figureI, the code G corresponds to the class of constructions:sub jec t -verb -d i rec t  sentent ia l  complement,  noted:(1) N O V qee P(N O ts the subject  and P stands for sentence).Each column is a syntactic property, and corresponds to a structure intowhich V may enter, roughly a syntactic transform of the main structure,~or example, in columns we have placed the Passive forms, Extraposed andrenominal forms.
Thus, the related structures are semantically close.
"+" sign at the intersection of a row and a column indicates that thentry in the row is accepted in the structure associated to the column," - "  sign correspoeds to inacceptability.
The process of accumulationthat led to the formalized lexicon-grammar of 12,000 French verbs hasrun into what seemed to be at first a minor problem of representation ofwords: the difference between simple and compound words, On the onehand, there are simple words ~uch as the verb know and complex(idiomatic) forms such as keep in mind, Both forms play the samesyetactic arid semantic role in sentences such as:Bob knows that Max ha~ moved to TampaBob keeps in mind that Max /)as moved to Tampabat the lexical content (one word va three) requires differentidentification procedures (simple dictionary tooktJp vs a certain amountof syntact ic analys}s).The representation of fiGUre 1 treats two forms such as to know(,~erneone, something) arid to keep (someone, something\] in mind mtf~ same way, thut~ emphasizing the semantic equivalence between simpleand compound verbs,Bet compoged terms raise ~;i problem of representation.
The unit ofrepresentation in a linear lexicon is roughly the word 5 as def ined byits written form, that is, a .~equence of letters separated fromne~lhbOring sequences by boundary bionic.
As a consequence, compoundwords cam|of be directly put into a dictionary the way simple words are.Aa idenUficatior| procedure i:~ needed for their occurrences in texts,and thi~ procedure will make use of the various simple parts of thecompound utterance.
Hence, the formal linguistic properties of con'lpouudterms will determine both the procedure of ideetifieaUon in text~ andthe type of storage they require.observerobtenir-I- officialiseromettreordlestreroublier-- oui'rpalper~arapher~asser sous silence~enser)ercevoir)erdre de vueperforerp~rorer\[ Compl~nt  di:oc(Compl6tive$-ii i !-I -I -I i1_ - -  + -+ -- + 4-_ -- + +TABLE 6 Verbs with Sentential Complements(From M. Gross 1975)iI_Om+ -+ -+++ -+ -+++ .-.+ --i -+ -+ i -IF igure  IWe thus have to discuss the main types of compounds and to singleout those properties that bear on automatic parsing and dictionarylookup.1.
Compound adverbsWe call adverb any circumstancial complement, including sentent)alphrases ,  as in the  fo l lowing  examples :(1) The show took place nighllyel nightduring a busy nightthe night Bob missed his planeBy compound adverbs, or frozen or idiomatic adverbs, we mean adverbsthat can be separated into several words, with some or all of  theirwords frozen, that is, semantically and/or syntacticallynoncomposit ional.
In (1), af night is a compound adverb, the lackof compos i t iona l i ty  is apparent  f rom lexical  res t r i c t ions  such as:*at  day, *at afternoon, *at eveningand by the impossibi l i ty of insert ing material  that is a priorip laus ib le ,  syntact i ca l l y  and semant ica l ly :*at (coming.
present) night*st ( co ld ,  dark) nightduring the (coming, present) nightduring s (cold, dark) night5.
Note that words or roots are often considered as units in mosta t tempts  to dev ise  semant ic  representat ions .Notice that nightly can also be considered as a frozen compound,though not constituted of words but Of a word and a suffix.
Again, lackof composit ional i ty stems from the observation that daily,weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.
which are compounds of thesame formal type have a regular formation, in the sense that theirinterpretation is homogeneous.
Thus, nightly is an isolated case,as opposed to an open series of identical forms with a differentin terpreta t ion .The two other adverbs of (1) are tree forms.
Thus, the determinersDet and mod i f ie rs  (Adl and Re/clause) of :during Det Adj night Relclauaecan vary freely (within semantic constraints).
In the same way, tfmevent  assoc ia ted  with the  sentence  8 in the  form:the night (E, that) 8can be expressed  by a large var ie ty  of unconst ra ined  forms.Frozen or compound adverbs constitute the simplest case of compoundforms because they do not allow variations of their components.
Asment ioned above, in at night no adject ive is authorized.
Moreover,one cannot insert  a determiner :  *at (a, this) night, the plural isforbidden: *at nights and no relative clause can be appended:*M night (that, which) was agreed on.Such observations are general, and apply to many adverbs of variedform and lex ica l  content :It rained cats and dogs*many cats and dogs*big cats and dogs*cat and dogfrom time to tit~e~trorn timet~ to times* f rom a time to another timefrom long time to long timeConsequently, these compound adverbs could be identified by a simplerecognRiorr procedure, for they do not require any lei, amatization orsyntactic analysis to be reduced to a dictionary form, as is the casewith verb  for)as for example .A lexieal study of compound adverbs has been performed in Frenchand a systematic inventory has been compiled from various dictionaries.Runni,g texts have been examined as well.
It is interesting to notethat whereas in current dictionaries there are about 1,500 one wordadverbs, most of them in -meat (-ly), we have found over 5,000compound adverbs,These compound adverbs have been classihed according to theirsywtacltc shape.
The syntactic forms are described at the elementarylevel ef sequences of fmrts of speech.
We use symbols with obviousin terpretat ions  such as Prep, Dot, Adl, N, V, COOl(fay conjunction) and W for a variable ranging over verb complements,etc.
We wr i te :Prep N =: at nightPrep Dot N =: in the endPrep Dot Adf N =: in the long r imProp Oel, N el Dot N =: in every nonce of the wordat the point of a gunProp Def N Ceni Dot N =: time and againV W =: to begin withS =: all things being equalF gure 2 shows the classes that have been defined on this basis,together  wi th  examples  and the  number  el, i tems in each (:lass;.

(;ros;,s 19~6 )Tableau 2The examples discussed an far are entirely frozen.
Itence, as ai)vuctical matter, they can be located iu a text by using the searchfunction available for strings in any text editor system.
There arehowever more complex examples that require deeper analysis.
Considerfay example  the i d iomat ic  adverb  in the  sentence:Max propoaed 8ohrtiena from l,he top of his hatIt ic largely frozen: no other determiner  is allowed, no adject ives canbe appended to either noun, etc., but the person of the possessiveadject ive Pone, may vary.
This possessive adject ive must refer tothe sub jec t  of the  sentence,  and var ies  accord ingly :*Max propound ideas from the top el your hat*My staler proposed ideas from the top of his hatBob and Max proposed ideas from the top of their hat(8)In this case.
the recognition procedure is no longer a simple stringmatching operation, since a variable slot must be dealt with inside thefixed string.
More general matching rules are required here 6.
Oncethis compound adverb l,laa been identified in a text to be processed, itcan be given an iaterpt~etation, for example in terms of a simple adverbsuch as teiaarely or l ightly and the re fe rent ia l  in fo rmat ioncarried by Pots can then be ignored.
Itowever, one oar\] easilyconstruct particular discourses where the obligatory cereferencerelation involved will (bsambiguate some analysis.
Thus, not only thevariat ien of Poaa must be accounted l,or at the lexical level, butits referent ia l  infermatien has to be kept l,or possible use in a parser.
{fiber compound adverbs oi ler  different degrees of variation.
Therem'e cases where one part of the adverb is frozen and another part isent i re ly  f ree:Max organized a par ty  in honor of BobMax hid the car at the far end of the park ing lotThe parts in honor, al the far end are frozen.
For example,they do not allow modil,iers.
The parts of N are tree, for weobserve  var ia t ions  such as:Max organized a par ty  in hJa honorMax hid the car at the lar end, I think, of the parking lotCons ider  the adverb ia ls :for  the sake of ru in ing thinfjsfor the sake of Bobfor  God's sakeWe (:all the combinatien for--cake frozen, since the nounsake does not occur elsewhere than in adverbial phrases with thepreposit ion for: it cannot be the subject  or object  of any verb.On the other hand, the modif iers of sake are quite varied andregular from the point of view of the syntax of noun modifiers 7.There are also cases of seemingly free adverbs which require an adhoc t reatment .
For  example ,  dates  such as:Monday March 13, 1968 at 9 pan.are descr ibed  it) a natura l  way by a f in i te  automaton.Tecl;nical or specialized families of adverbs come close to beingf rozeu  adverbs:(2) They elected Bob on the ( f i r s l ,  second) ballot(3) Max ate his noodles in a bow/The special semantic relations that hold between the adverbialcomplement and the rest el, the sentence are lirmted.
There are fewverbs such as to eat which combine with in a bowl and whichhave the non locative interpretat ion of (3).
The usual interpretat ionis tha i  found in:6.
PRDLOG rules are particularly well adapted to recognizing suchf rozen  fo rms  (P. Sabat ie r  1980).7.
There  are  nonethe less  res t r i c t ions  on them:~for a heavenly ,~okeMax puF hia nood le~ in a bowlEntering ITozen adverbs into a lexicon-grammar raises many r=ewquestions, The bulk of adverbs can be described by means of theFollowing type of der ivat ion (Z.S, Harr is  197?
):Bob left ;  7hat  Bob left  occur red  at 9: Bob lef t ,  fhia occur red  at 9:: Bob le f t  at 9and sulaport verbs play a crucial role here.
However, there are caseswhere no general support verb is found and where adverbs have to beconsidered as a part of the elementary sentence.
Consider the adverbin:Bob sang  at the top of hJ~ voiceIt is syntactically and semantically analogous to tree adverbs such asnois i ly,  power fe l l y .
For these two free adverbs, a der ivat ionalsource involv ing the ad ject ive  is available:The way Bob sang  was (noiay,  power tn / )This is not the case for at the top of his voice which ispractically limited to modifying the verbs of saying.
Moreover theobbgatory core ference  link of hia leads to a representation wherethis adverb is not analyzed.
Thus two semantically similar types ofadverbs have to be represented quite differently in the lexicon-grammar.All the situations just exemplified with adverbs are quite common, codare also encountered with nouns, adjectives and verbs.
The paradox el ~relaresentatJon they lead to can only be solved by introducing a complexlevel of semantic equivalence for the entries of the lexicon-grammar,2, Compound nounsC~n'npound nouns form the bulk of the lexicon of languages.
Languagecreativity is largely associated with the growth of technicalvocabularies which consist mainly of technical nouns.
Compound nounsnumber in the millions for European laoguages.
They are usually builtrrem the vocabulary of simple words by means or grammatical rules whichmay involve grammatical words.
By definition, their meaniog isnencompositional.
The compound nouns can be described in terms of thesequence of their grammatical categories, in the same way as for adverbs(IA.
Gross, D. Tremblay 1985).
We have for example:Det N =: the moonAdl  N =: c rude  oil, rea l  ealaFeN of N =: e l roke of luck,board  of (governors ,  regenfa)Det N of  Dot N =: the talk of  the townN N =: lest  lobe,  co lor  7VSuch nouns can become qui te  complex in var ious techn ica l  Fields.In general, compound nouns allow variations of determiners andmodif iers,  but many s i tuat ions are encountered:the moon is a frozen combination, - -  definite article-noun--  which behaves like a proper name, because ot its unicity ofreference.
It cannot be modified by adjectives without losing itsreference:  * the  (b ig ,  ye l low)  moon;crude oil takes restricted determiners.
Since it is a mass noun,there are diff iculties in accepting its plural, It can be modified byadjectives and nouns as in (cheap, high qual i ty)  crude oH, butthese cannot modify el/: *c rude ,  (cheap ,  h igh qua l i ty )  oil;stroke of luck has unrestricted determiners and modifiers, bat noiosertion is allowed immediately before or next to of, in part icularluck cannot be modified: *stroke of gor~ luckS;8.
~,lrnko of bad luck would be a different compound word, whoserelat ion to afroke of luck  is only etymological.- board of governors one be modified in several ways: boarda~ld governora ta.ke separate determiners and modifiers: ~hepowerful boarda of the twelve governora of my bank, Such a compoundnoun comes close to being a free Form.
It is the liruited number ofsecond aeons such as d i rector ,  governor  or regent  thatsuggests we are dealing with a compound noun.
Also, the meameg ofthese phrases is nonoompoaitional in the sense that they have a legal orinst i tut ional  meaoing that  the i r  components  do not have clearly.The variations of lurer we have enumerated can be partly hal'=died bitatlcachiag a finite automaton to a given entry, and this automaton willdescribe the main grammatical changes allowed The adjunction o~ freerelative clauses to compound nouns may requ i re  a different t reatment"l~)e kiads of variation of compound nouns are aO numereu,~ thatcletermieing whether a given nomit)al coostruction is a compouod noun ornol: almost requires c~.

We writeN i for variable noun phrases and C i for frozen noun phrases.
Forsubjects; i = 0, for complements: i = I, 2.
Examples are:(I) N O V C t =: Bob hit  the /ackpot(2) N 0 V N 1 Prep C 2 =: Bob took your project into account(3) N 0 V C I  Prep C 2 =: Bob look the bull by Ihe heron(4) N?~ C 0 V C t =: Bob 'a  dream came trueWe outlined in I the description ot a lexicon-grammar of Frenchv~bs and the reasons why compound verbs had to be separated from simpleOn~S.~;ystematic search through dictionaries (monolingaal, bilingual, andspecialized) has yielded close to 20,000 compound verbs belonging to thesame level of language as the 12,000 simple verbs.
A syntacticc lassi f icat ion has been bui l t  for them (F igure 3).Compound verbs are the most complex Forms that have to be enteredinto a lexicon ?t.
The compounds discussed previously were simple9.
There are however a limited number of frozen discourses such as:I f  wa,s for  al l  Ihe wor ld  aa it  SWhich need an extra level  of complex i ty  (L.

For example, there isno reason to attach the Passive marking to the verb rather than toeither of the complements of the utterance to put the cart before thehorse, Lexicon-grammar representations eliminate such questions bydolocalizing the syntactic information and by attaching it to the fullsentence, In this sense, compound expressions provide a powerfuln\]etivation for representing lexical and syntactic phenomena in the formof a lex icon-grammar .11.
The saree use of se(luences of syntactic categories is found in nstring grammar (Z.S+ Harris 1961), which has proven to be quiteefficient in syntactic recognition (N, Sager 1981, M. Salkoff 1973,1979).REFERENCESBoeas, Jean-Paul,, Guillet, Alain.
