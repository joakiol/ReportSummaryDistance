ROUGE: A Package for Automatic Evaluation of SummariesChin-Yew LinInformation Sciences InstituteUniversity of Southern California4676 Admiralty WayMarina del Rey, CA  90292cyl@isi.eduAbstractROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy forGisting Evaluation.
It includes measures to auto-matically determine the quality of a summary bycomparing it to other (ideal) summaries created byhumans.
The measures count the number of over-lapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, andword pairs between the computer-generated sum-mary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries cre-ated by humans.
This paper introduces four differentROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W,and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summariza-tion evaluation package and their evaluations.
Threeof them have been used in the Document Under-standing Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scalesummarization evaluation sponsored by NIST.1 IntroductionTraditionally evaluation of summarization involveshuman judgments of different quality metrics, forexample, coherence, conciseness, grammaticality,readability, and content (Mani, 2001).
However,even simple manual evaluation of summaries on alarge scale over a few linguistic quality questionsand content coverage as in the Document Under-standing Conference (DUC) (Over and Yen, 2003)would require over 3,000 hours of human efforts.This is very expensive and difficult to conduct in afrequent basis.
Therefore, how to evaluate summa-ries automatically has drawn a lot of attention in thesummarization research community in recent years.For example, Saggion et al (2002) proposed threecontent-based evaluation methods that measuresimilarity between summaries.
These methods are:cosine similarity, unit overlap (i.e.
unigram or bi-gram), and longest common subsequence.
However,they did not show how the results of these automaticevaluation methods correlate to human judgments.Following the successful application of automaticevaluation methods, such as BLEU (Papineni et al,2001), in machine translation evaluation, Lin andHovy (2003) showed that methods similar to BLEU,i.e.
n-gram co-occurrence statistics, could be appliedto evaluate summaries.
In this paper, we introduce apackage, ROUGE, for automatic evaluation of sum-maries and its evaluations.
ROUGE stands for Re-call-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation.
Itincludes several automatic evaluation methods thatmeasure the similarity between summaries.
We de-scribe ROUGE-N in Section 2, ROUGE-L in Section3, ROUGE-W in Section 4, and ROUGE-S in Section5.
Section 6 shows how these measures correlatewith human judgments using DUC 2001, 2002, and2003 data.
Section 7 concludes this paper and dis-cusses future directions.2 ROUGE-N: N-gram Co-Occurrence StatisticsFormally, ROUGE-N is an n-gram recall between acandidate summary and a set of reference summa-ries.
ROUGE-N is computed as follows:ROUGE-N?
??
??
??
?=}{}{)()(SummariesReferenceS SgramSummariesReferemceS SgrammatchnnnngramCountgramCount(1)Where n stands for the length of the n-gram,gramn, and Countmatch(gramn) is the maximum num-ber of n-grams co-occurring in a candidate summaryand a set of reference summaries.It is clear that ROUGE-N is a recall-related meas-ure because the denominator of the equation is thetotal sum of the number of n-grams occurring at thereference summary side.
A closely related measure,BLEU, used in automatic evaluation of machinetranslation, is a precision-based measure.
BLEUmeasures how well a candidate translation matchesa set of reference translations by counting the per-centage of n-grams in the candidate translation over-lapping with the references.
Please see Papineni etal.
(2001) for details about BLEU.Note that the number of n-grams in the denomina-tor of the ROUGE-N formula increases as we addmore references.
This is intuitive and reasonablebecause there might exist multiple good summaries.Every time we add a reference into the pool, we ex-pand the space of alternative summaries.
By con-trolling what types of references we add to thereference pool, we can design evaluations that focuson different aspects of summarization.
Also notethat the numerator sums over all reference summa-ries.
This effectively gives more weight to matchingn-grams occurring in multiple references.
Thereforea candidate summary that contains words shared bymore references is favored by the ROUGE-N meas-ure.
This is again very intuitive and reasonable be-cause we normally prefer a candidate summary thatis more similar to consensus among reference sum-maries.2.1 Multiple ReferencesSo far, we only demonstrated how to computeROUGE-N using a single reference.
When multiplereferences are used, we compute pairwise summary-level ROUGE-N between a candidate summary s andevery reference, ri, in the reference set.
We thentake the maximum of pairwise summary-levelROUGE-N scores as the final multiple referenceROUGE-N score.
This can be written as follows:ROUGE-Nmulti  = argmaxi ROUGE-N(ri,s)This procedure is also applied to computation ofROUGE-L (Section 3), ROUGE-W (Section 4) , andROUGE-S (Section 5).
In the implementation, we usea Jackknifing procedure.
Given M references, wecompute the best score over M sets of M-1 refer-ences.
The final ROUGE-N score is the average ofthe M ROUGE-N scores using different M-1 refer-ences.
The Jackknifing procedure is adopted sincewe often need to compare system and human per-formance and the reference summaries are usuallythe only human summaries available.
Using thisprocedure, we are able to estimate average humanperformance by averaging M ROUGE-N scores ofone reference vs. the rest M-1 references.
Althoughthe Jackknif ing procedure is not necessary when wejust want to compute ROUGE scores using multiplereferences, it is applied in all ROUGE score compu-tations in the ROUGE evaluation package.In the next section, we describe a ROUGE measurebased on longest common subsequences betweentwo summaries.3 ROUGE-L: Longest Common SubsequenceA sequence Z = [z1, z2, ..., zn] is a subsequence ofanother sequence X = [x1, x2, ..., xm], if there exists astrict increasing sequence [i1, i2, ..., ik] of indices ofX such that for all j = 1, 2, ..., k, we have xij = zj(Cormen et al, 1989).
Given two sequences X andY, the longest common subsequence (LCS) of X andY is a common subsequence with maximum length.LCS has been used in identifying cognate candi-dates during construction of N-best translation lexi-con from parallel text.
Melamed (1995) used theratio (LCSR) between the length of the LCS of twowords and the length of the longer word of the twowords to measure the cognateness between them.He used LCS as an approximate string matchingalgorithm.
Saggion et al (2002) used normalizedpairwise LCS to compare simila rity between twotexts in automatic summarization evaluation.3.1 Sentence-Level LCSTo apply LCS in summarization evaluation, weview a summary sentence as a sequence of words.The intuition is that the longer the LCS of twosummary sentences is, the more similar the twosummaries are.
We propose using LCS-based F-measure to estimate the similarity between twosummaries X of length m and Y of length n, assum-ing X is a reference summary sentence and Y is acandidate summary sentence, as follows:RlcsmYXLCS ),(=       (2)PlcsnYXLCS ),(=       (3)FlcslcslcslcslcsPRPR22)1(bb++= (4)Where LCS(X,Y) is the length of a longest com-mon subsequence of X and Y, and ?
= Plcs/Rlcs when?Flcs/?Rlcs_=_?Flcs/?Plcs.
In DUC, ?
is set to a verybig number (?
8 ).
Therefore, only Rlcs is consid-ered.
We call the LCS-based F-measure, i.e.
Equa-tion 4, ROUGE-L. Notice that ROUGE-L is 1 when X= Y; while ROUGE-L is zero when LCS(X,Y) = 0, i.e.there is nothing in common between X and Y. F-measure or its equivalents has been shown to havemet several theoretical criteria in measuring accu-racy involving more than one factor (Van Rijsber-gen, 1979).
The composite factors are LCS-basedrecall and precision in this case.
Melamed et al(2003) used unigram F-measure to estimate machinetranslation quality and showed that unigram F-measure was as good as BLEU.One advantage of using LCS is that it does not re-quire consecutive matches but in-sequence matchesthat reflect sentence level word order as n-grams.The other advantage is that it automatically includeslongest in-sequence common n-grams, therefore nopredefined n-gram length is necessary.ROUGE-L as defined in Equation 4 has the prop-erty that its value is less than or equal to the min i-mum of unigram F-measure of X and Y. Unigramrecall reflects the proportion of words in X (refer-ence summary sentence) that are also present in Y(candidate summary sentence); while unigram pre-cision is the proportion of words in Y that are also inX.
Unigram recall and precision count all co-occurring words regardless their orders; whileROUGE-L counts only in-sequence co-occurrences.By only awarding credit to in-sequence unigrammatches, ROUGE-L also captures sentence levelstructure in a natural way.
Consider the followingexample:S1.
police killed the gunmanS2.
police kill the gunmanS3.
the gunman kill policeWe only consider ROUGE-2, i.e.
N=2, for the pur-pose of explanation.
Using S1 as the reference andS2 and S3 as the candidate summary sentences, S2and S3 would have the same ROUGE-2 score, sincethey both have one bigram, i.e.
?the gunman?.
How-ever, S2 and S3 have very different meanings.
In thecase of ROUGE-L, S2 has a score of 3/4 = 0.75 andS3 has a score of 2/4 = 0.5, with ?
= 1.
Therefore S2is better than S3 according to ROUGE-L.
This exam-ple also illustrated that ROUGE-L can work reliablyat sentence level.However, LCS suffers one disadvantage that itonly counts the main in-sequence words; therefore,other alternative LCSes and shorter sequences arenot reflected in the final score.
For example, giventhe following candidate sentence:S4.
the gunman police killedUsing S1 as its reference, LCS counts either ?thegunman?
or ?police killed?, but not both; therefore,S4 has the same ROUGE-L score as S3.
ROUGE-2would prefer S4 than S3.3.2 Summary-Level LCSPrevious section described how to compute sen-tence-level LCS-based F-measure score.
When ap-plying to summary-level, we take the union LCSmatches between a reference summary sentence, ri,and every candidate summary sentence, cj.
Given areference summary of u sentences containing a totalof m words and a candidate summary of v sentencescontaining a total of n words, the summary-levelLCS-based F-measure can be computed as follows:Rlcs mCrLCSuii?=?= 1),((5)Plcs nCrLCSuii?=?= 1),((6)FlcslcslcslcslcsPRPR22)1(bb++=    (7)Again ?
is set to a very big number (?
8 ) inDUC, i.e.
only Rlcs is considered.
),( CrLCS i?
is theLCS score of the union longest common subse-quence between reference sentence ri and candidatesummary C. For example, if ri = w1 w2 w3 w4 w5, andC contains two sentences: c1 = w1 w2 w6 w7 w8 and c2= w1 w3 w8 w9 w5, then the longest common subse-quence of ri and c1 is ?w1 w2?
and the longest com-mon subsequence of ri and c2 is ?w1 w3 w5?.
Theunion longest common subsequence of ri, c1, and c2is ?w1 w2 w3 w5?
and ),( CrLCS i?

(page 51, 2002) between two summaries S1 andS2, LCS(S1 ,S2)MEAD , is written as follows:?

= 1.
Sentence-level normalized pairwise LCS is the same asROUGE-L with ?
= 1.
Besides setting ?
= 1, sum-mary-level normalized pairwise LCS is differentfrom ROUGE-L in how a sentence gets its LCS scorefrom its references.
Normalized pairwise LCS takesthe best LCS score while ROUGE-L takes the unionLCS score.4 ROUGE-W: Weighted Longest Common Sub-sequenceLCS has many nice properties as we have describedin the previous sections.
Unfortunately, the basicLCS also has a problem that it does not differentiateLCSes of different spatial relations within their em-bedding sequences.
For example, given a referencesequence X and two candidate sequences Y1 and Y2as follows:X:  [A B C D E F G]Y1: [A B C D H I K]Y2:  [A H B K C I D]Y1 and Y2 have the same ROUGE-L score.
How-ever, in this case, Y1 should be the better choice thanY2 because Y1 has consecutive matches.
To improvethe basic LCS method, we can simply remember thelength of consecutive matches encountered so far toa regular two dimensional dynamic program tablecomputing LCS.
We call this weighted LCS(WLCS) and use k to indicate the length of the cur-rent consecutive matches ending at words xi and yj.Given two sentences X and Y, the WLCS score of Xand Y can be computed using the following dynamicprogramming procedure:(1) For (i = 0; i <=m; i++)c(i,j) = 0  // initialize c-tablew(i,j) = 0 // initialize w-table(2) For (i = 1; i <= m; i++)For (j = 1; j <= n; j++)If xi = yj Then// the length of consecutive matches at// position i-1 and j -1k  = w(i-1,j-1)c(i,j) = c(i-1,j-1) + f(k+1 ) ?
f(k)// remember the length of consecutive// matches at position i, jw(i,j) = k+1OtherwiseIf c(i-1,j) > c(i,j-1) Thenc(i,j) = c(i-1,j)w(i,j) = 0           // no match at i, jElse c(i,j) = c(i,j-1)w(i,j) = 0           // no match at i, j(3) WLCS(X,Y) = c(m,n)Where c is the dynamic programming table, c(i,j)stores the WLCS score ending at word xi of X and yjof Y, w is the table storing the length of consecutivematches ended at c table position i and j, and f is afunction of consecutive matches at the table posi-tion, c(i,j).
Notice that by providing differentweighting function f, we can parameterize theWLCS algorithm to assign different credit to con-secutive in-sequence matches.The weighting function f must have the propertythat f(x+y) > f(x) + f(y) for any positive integers xand y.
In other words, consecutive matches areawarded more scores than non-consecutive matches.For example, f(k)-=-ak ?
b when k >= 0, and a, b >0.
This function charges a gap penalty of ?b foreach non-consecutive n-gram sequences.
Anotherpossible function family is the polynomial family ofthe form ka where -a > 1.
However, in order tonormalize the final ROUGE-W score, we also preferto have a function that has a close form inversefunction.
For example, f(k)-=-k2 has a close forminverse function f -1(k)-=-k1/2.
F-measure based onWLCS can be computed as follows, given two se-quences X of length m and Y of length n:Rwlcs ???????
?= -)(),(1mfYXWLCSf       (13)Pwlcs ???????
?= -)(),(1nfYXWLCSf       (14)FwlcswlcswlcswlcswlcsPRPR22)1(bb++=           (15)Where f -1 is the inverse function of f. In DUC, ?
isset to a very big number (?
8 ).
Therefore, onlyRwlcs is considered.
We call the WLCS-based F-measure, i.e.
Equation 15, ROUGE-W.
Using Equa-tion 15 and f(k)-=-k2 as the weighting function, theROUGE-W scores for sequences Y1 and Y2 are 0.571and 0.286 respectively.
Therefore, Y1 would beranked higher than Y2 using WLCS.
We use thepolynomial function of the form ka in the ROUGEevaluation package.
In the next section, we intro-duce the skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics.5 ROUGE-S: Skip-Bigram Co-Occurrence Sta-tisticsSkip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentenceorder, allowing for arbitrary gaps.
Skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set ofreference translations.
Using the example given inSection 3.1:S1.
police killed the gunmanS2.
police kill the gunmanS3.
the gunman kill policeS4.
the gunman police killedeach sentence has C(4,2)1 = 6 skip-bigrams.
For ex-ample, S1 has the following skip-bigrams:(?police killed?, ?police the?, ?police gunman?,?killed the?, ?killed gunman?, ?the gunman?
)S2 has three skip-bigram matches with S1 (?po-lice the?, ?police gunman?, ?the gunman?
), S3 hasone skip-bigram match with S1 (?the gunman?
), andS4 has two skip-bigram matches with S1 (?policekilled?, ?the gunman?).
Given translations X oflength m and Y of length n, assuming X is a refer-ence translation and Y is a candidate translation, wecompute skip-bigram-based F-measure as follows:Rskip2)2,(),(2mCYXSKIP=           (16)Pskip2)2,(),(2nCYXSKIP=           (17)Fskip2222222)1(skipskipskipskipPRPRbb++=   (18)Where SKIP2(X,Y) is the number of skip-bigrammatches between X and Y, ?
controlling the relativeimportance of Pskip2 and Rskip2, and  C is the combi-nation function.
We call the skip-bigram-based F-measure, i.e.
Equation 18, ROUGE-S.Using Equation 18 with ?
= 1 and S1 as the refer-ence, S2?s ROUGE-S score is 0.5, S3 is 0.167, andS4 is 0.333.
Therefore, S2 is better than S3 and S4,and S4 is better than S3.
This result is more intuitivethan using BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L. One advantage ofskip-bigram vs. BLEU is that it does not require con-secutive matches but is still sensitive to word order.Comparing skip-bigram with LCS, skip-bigramcounts all in-order matching word pairs while LCSonly counts one longest common subsequence.Applying skip-bigram without any constraint onthe distance between the words, spurious matchessuch as ?the the?
or ?of in?
might be counted asvalid matches.
To reduce these spurious matches,we can limit the maximum skip distance, dskip, be-tween two in-order words that is allowed to form askip-bigram.
For example, if we set dskip to 0 thenROUGE-S is equivalent to bigram overlap F-measure.
If we set dskip to 4 then only word pairs ofat most 4 words apart can form skip-bigrams.Adjusting Equations 16, 17, and 18 to use maxi-mum skip distance limit is straightforward: we onlycount the skip-bigram matches, SKIP2 (X,Y), withinthe maximum skip distance and replace denomina-tors of Equations 16, C(m,2), and 17, C(n,2), withthe actual numbers of within distance skip-bigramsfrom the reference and the candidate respectively.1 C(4,2) = 4!/(2!*2!)
= 6.5.1 ROUGE-SU: Extension of ROUGE-SOne potential problem for ROUGE-S is that it doesnot give any credit to a candidate sentence if thesentence does not have any word pair co-occurringwith its references.
For example, the following sen-tence has a ROUGE-S score of zero:S5.
gunman the killed policeS5 is the exact reverse of S1 and there is no skipbigram match between them.
However, we wouldlike to differentiate sentences similar to S5 fromsentences that do not have single word co-occurrence with S1.
To achieve this, we extendROUGE-S with the addition of unigram as countingunit.
The extended version is called ROUGE-SU.
Wecan also obtain ROUGE-SU from ROUGE-S by add-ing a begin-of-sentence marker at the beginning ofcandidate and reference sentences.6 Evaluations of ROUGETo assess the effectiveness of ROUGE measures, wecompute the correlation between ROUGE assignedsummary scores and human assigned summaryscores.
The intuition is that a good evaluation meas-ure should assign a good score to a good summaryand a bad score to a bad summary.
The ground truthis based on human assigned scores.
Acquiring hu-man judgments are usually very expensive; fortu-nately, we have DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003evaluation data that include human judgments forthe following:?
Single document summaries of about 100words: 12 systems 2 for DUC 2001 and 14 sys-tems for 2002.
149 single document summarieswere judged per system in DUC 2001 and 295were judged in DUC 2002.?
Single document very short summaries of about10 words (headline-like, keywords, or phrases):14 systems for DUC 2003.
624 very short sum-maries were judged per system in DUC 2003.?
Multi-document summaries of about 10 words:6 systems for DUC 2002; 50 words: 14 systemsfor DUC 2001 and 10 systems for DUC 2002;100 words: 14 systems for DUC 2001, 10 sys-tems for DUC 2002, and 18 systems for DUC2003; 200 words: 14 systems for DUC 2001 and10 systems for DUC 2002; 400 words: 14 sys-tems for DUC 2001.
29 summaries were judgedper system per summary size in DUC 2001, 59were judged in DUC 2002, and 30 were judgedin DUC 2003.2 All systems include 1 or 2 baselines.
Please see DUCwebsite for details.Besides these human judgments, we also have 3 setsof manual summaries for DUC 2001, 2 sets forDUC 2002, and 4 sets for DUC 2003.
Humanjudges assigned content coverage scores to a candi-date summary by examining the percentage of con-tent overlap between a manual summary unit, i.e.elementary discourse unit or sentence, and the can-didate summary using Summary Evaluation Envi-ronment3 (SEE) developed by  the University ofSouthern California?s Information Sciences Institute(ISI).
The overall candidate summary score is theaverage of the content coverage scores of all theunits in the manual summary.
Note that humanjudges used only one manual summary in all theevaluations although multiple alternative summarieswere available.With the DUC data, we computed Pearson?sproduct moment correlation coefficients, Spear-man?s rank order correlation coefficients, andKendall?s correlation coefficients between systems?average ROUGE scores and their human assignedaverage coverage scores using single reference andmultiple references.
To investigate the effect ofstemming and inclusion or exclusion of stopwords,we also ran experiments over orig inal automatic  and3 SEE is available online at http://www.isi.edu/~cyl.manual summaries (CASE set), stemmed4 version ofthe summaries (STEM set), and stopped version ofthe summaries (STOP set).
For example, we com-puted ROUGE scores for the 12 systems participatedin the DUC 2001 single document summarizationevaluation using the CASE set with single referenceand then calculated the three correlation scores forthese 12 systems?
ROUGE scores vs. human assignedaverage coverage scores.
After that we repeated theprocess using multiple references and then usingSTEM and STOP sets.
Therefore, 2 (multi or single)x 3 (CASE, STEM, or STOP) x 3 (Pearson, Spear-man, or Kendall) = 18 data points were collected foreach ROUGE measure and each DUC task.
To assessthe significance of the results, we applied bootstrapresampling technique (Davison and Hinkley, 1997)to estimate 95% confidence intervals for every cor-relation computation.17 ROUGE measures were tested for each run us-ing ROUGE evaluation package v1.2.1: ROUGE-Nwith N = 1 to 9, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W withweighting factor a  = 1.2, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SUwith maximum skip distance dskip = 1, 4, and 9.
Dueto limitation of space, we only report correlationanalysis results based on Pearson?s correlation coef-ficient.
Correlation analyses based on Spearman?sand Kendall?s correlation coefficients are trackingPearson?s very closely and will be posted later at theROUGE website5 for reference.
The critical value6for Pearson?s correlation is 0.632 at 95% confidencewith 8 degrees of freedom.Table 1 shows the Pearson?s correlation coeffi-cients of the 17 ROUGE measures vs. human judg-ments on DUC 2001 and 2002 100 words singledocument summarization data.
The best values ineach column are marked with dark (green) color andstatistically equivalent values to the best values aremarked with gray.
We found that correlations werenot affected by stemming or removal of stopwordsin this data set, ROUGE-2 performed better amongthe ROUGE-N variants, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, andROUGE-S were all performing well, and using mul-tiple references improved performance though notmuch.
All ROUGE measures achieved very goodcorrelation with human judgments in the DUC 2002data.
This might due to the double sample size inDUC 2002 (295 vs. 149 in DUC 2001) for each sys-tem.Table 2 shows the correlation analysis results onthe DUC 2003 single document very short summarydata.

Due to the large numberof samples (624) in this data set, using multiple ref-erences did not improve correlations.In Table 3 A1, A2, and A3, we show correlationanalysis results on DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 100words multi-document summarization data.
Theresults indicated that using multiple references im-proved correlation and exclusion of stopwords usu-ally improved performance.
ROUGE-1, 2, and 3performed fine but were not consistent.
ROUGE-1,ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-SU4, ROUGE-S9, and ROUGE-SU9 with stopword removal had correlation above0.70.
ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W did not work well inthis set of data.Table 3 C, D1, D2, E1, E2, and F show the corre-lation analyses using multiple references on the restof DUC data.
These results again suggested thatexclusion of stopwords achieved better performanceespecially in multi-document summaries of 50words.
Better correlations (> 0.70) were observedon long summary tasks, i.e.
200 and 400 wordssummaries.
The relative performance of ROUGEmeasures followed the pattern of the 100 wordsmulti-document summarization task.Comparing the results in Table 3 with Tables 1and 2, we found that correlation values in the multi-document tasks rarely reached high 90% except inlong summary tasks.
One possible explanation ofthis outcome is that we did not have large amount ofsamples for the multi-document tasks.
In the singledocument summarization tasks we had over 100samples; while we only had about 30 samples in themulti-document tasks.
The only tasks that had over30 samples was from DUC 2002 and the correla-tions of ROUGE measures with human judgments onthe 100 words summary task were much better andmore stable than similar tasks in DUC 2001 and2003.
Statistically stable human judgments of sys-tem performance might not be obtained due to lackof samples and this in turn caused instability of cor-relation analyses.7 ConclusionsIn this paper, we introduced ROUGE, an automaticevaluation package for summarization, and con-ducted comprehensive evaluations of the automaticmeasures included in the ROUGE package usingthree years of DUC data.
To check the significanceof the results, we estimated confidence intervals ofcorrelations using bootstrap resampling.
We foundthat (1) ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, andROUGE-S worked well in single document summa-rization tasks, (2) ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W,ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 performed great inevaluating very short summaries (or headline-likesummaries), (3) correlation of high 90% was hard toachieve for multi-document summarization tasks butROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-S9,ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 worked reasonablywell when stopwords were excluded from matching,(4) exclusion of  stopwords usually improved corre-lation, and (5) correlations to human judgmentswere increased by using multiple references.In summary, we showed that the ROUGE packagecould be used effectively in automatic evaluation ofsummaries.

However, how to achieve high correla-tion with human judgments in multi-documentsummarization tasks as ROUGE already did in singledocument summarization tasks is still an open re-search topic.8  AcknowledgementsThe author would like to thank the anonymous re-viewers for their constructive comments, Paul Overat NIST, U.S.A, and ROUGE users around the worldfor testing and providing useful feedback on earlierversions of the ROUGE evaluation package, and theDARPA TIDES project for supporting this research.ReferencesCormen, T.
