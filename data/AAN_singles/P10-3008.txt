In this paper we investigatea novel problem of discovering patternsbased on emotion and the association ofmoods and affective lexicon usage in bl-ogosphere, a representative for social me-dia.
We propose the use of normative emo-tional scores for English words in combi-nation with a psychological model of emo-tion measurement and a nonparametricclustering process for inferring meaning-ful emotion patterns automatically fromdata.
Our results on a dataset consisting ofmore than 17 million mood-groundtruthedblogposts have shown interesting evidenceof the emotion patterns automatically dis-covered that match well with the core-affect emotion model theorized by psy-chologists.
We then present a methodbased on information theory to discoverthe association of moods and affective lex-icon usage in the new media.1 IntroductionSocial media provides communication and inter-action channels where users can freely participatein, express their opinions, make their own content,and interact with other users.
Users in this newmedia are more comfortable in expressing theirfeelings, opinions, and ideas.
Thus, the resultinguser-generated content tends to be more subjec-tive than other written genres, and thus, is moreappealing to be investigated in terms of subjec-tivity and sentiment analysis.
Research in senti-ment analysis has recently attracted much atten-tion (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotionpatterns and studying the affective lexicon used insocial media have received little attention.Work in sentiment analysis in social media isoften limited to finding the sentiment sign in thedipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text.Extensions to this task include the three-class clas-sification (adding neutral to the polarity) and lo-cating the value of emotion the text carries acrossa spectrum of valence scores.
On the other hand,it is well appreciated by psychologists that sen-timent has much richer structures than the afore-mentioned simplified polarity.
For example, emo-tion ?
a form of expressive sentiment ?
was sug-gested by psychologists to be measured in termsof valence and arousal (Russell, 2009).
Thus, weare motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogo-sphere in a more fine-grained fashion.
In this pa-per we study the grouping behaviors of the emo-tion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blog-posts.
We are inspired to get insights into the ques-tion of whether these structures can be discovereddirectly from data without the cost of involvinghuman participants as in traditional psychologicalstudies.
Next, we aim to study the relationship be-tween the data-driven emotion structures discov-ered and those proposed by psychologists.Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment onlexical access is great in a psychology perspective.However, to our knowledge, limited work exists toexamine the same tasks in social media context.The contribution in this paper is twofold.
Toour understanding, we study a novel problem ofemotion-based pattern discovery in blogosphere.We provide an initial solution for the matter us-ing a combination of psychological models, affec-tive norm scores for English words, a novel featurerepresentation scheme, and a nonparametric clus-tering to automatically group moods into mean-ingful emotion patterns.
We believe that we arethe first to consider the matter of data-driven emo-tion pattern discovery at the scale presented in this43paper.
Secondly, we explore a novel problem ofdetecting the mood ?
affective lexicon usage cor-relation in the new media, and propose a novel useof a term-goodness criterion to discover this senti-ment ?
linguistic association.2 Related WorkMuch work in sentiment analysis measures thevalue of emotion the text convey in a continuumrange of valence (Pang and Lee, 2008).
Emo-tion patterns have often been used in sentimentanalysis limited to this one-dimensional formu-lation.
On the other hand, in psychology, emo-tions have often been represented in dimensionaland discrete perspectives.
In the former, emo-tion states are conceptualized as combinations ofsome factors like valence and arousal.
In con-trast, the latter style argues that each emotionhas a unique coincidence of experience, psychol-ogy and behavior (Mauss and Robinson, 2009).Our work utilizes the dimensional representation,and in particular, the core-affect model (Russell,2009), which encodes emotion states along thevalence and arousal dimensions.
The sentimentscoring for emotion bearing words is available ina lexicon known as Affective Norms for EnglishWords (ANEW) (Bradley and Lang, 1999).
Re-lated work making use of ANEW includes (Doddsand Danforth, 2009) for estimating happiness lev-els in three types of data: song lyrics, blogs, andthe State of the Union addresses.From a psychological perspective, for estimat-ing mood effects in lexicon decisions, (Chastain etal., 1995) investigates the influence of moods onthe access of affective words.
For learning affectin blogosphere, (Leshed and Kaye, 2006) utilizesSupport Vector Machines (SVM) to predict moodsfor coming blog posts and detect mood synonymy.3 Moods and Affective Lexicon Access3.1 Mood Pattern DetectionLivejournal provides a comprehensive set of 132moods for users to tag their moods when blogging.The provided moods range diversely in the emo-tion spectrum but typically are observed to fall intosoft clusters such as happiness (cheerful or grate-ful) or sadness (discontent or uncomfortable).
Wecall each cluster of these moods an emotion pat-tern and aim to detect them in this paper.We observe that the blogposts tagged withmoods in the same emotion pattern have similar7.27 7.36 7.47 7.51 7.59 7.63 7.72 7.97 8.1 8.1700.0050.010.0150.020.0250.030.0350.04ANEW and their arousal valuesUsage proportion of ANEWANGRYP*SSED OFFHAPPYCHEERFULsurprisedterrorist sexy assault anger win enraged orgasm rageromanticFigure 1: ANEW usage proportion in the poststagged with happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed offproportions in the usage of ANEW.
For example,in Figure 1 ?
a plot of the usage of ANEW hav-ing arousal in the range of 7.2 ?
8.2 in the blog-posts ?
we could see that the ANEW usage pat-terns of happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off arewell separated.
Anger, enraged, and rage will bemost likely found in the angry/p*ssed off taggedposts and least likely found in the happy/cheerfulones.
In contrast, the ANEW as romantic or sur-prised are not commonly used in the posts taggedwith angry/p*ssed off but most popularly used inthe happy/cheerful ones; suggesting that, the sim-ilarity between ANEW usage patterns can be usedas a basis to study the structure of mood space.Let us denote by B the corpus of all blogpostsand byM= {sad, happy, ...} the predefined set ofmoods (|M| = 132).
Each blogpost b ?
B inthe corpus is labeled with a mood lb?
M. De-note by n the number of ANEW (n = 1034).
Letxm= [xm1, ...,xmi, ...,xmn] be the vector repre-senting the usage of ANEW by the mood m. Thus,xmi=?b?B,lb=mcib, where cibis the countingof the ANEW i-th occurrence in the blogpost btagged with the mood m. The usage vector is nor-malized so that?ni=1xmi= 1 for all m ?
M.To discover the grouping of the moods based onthe usage vectors we use a nonparametric cluster-ing algorithm known as Affinity Propagation (AP)(Frey and Dueck, 2007).
AP is desirable herebecause it automatically discovers the number ofclusters as well as the cluster exemplars.
The al-gorithm only requires the pairwise similarities be-tween moods, which we compute based on the Eu-clidean distances for simplicity.To map the emotion patterns detected to theirpsychological meaning, we proceed to measure44the sentiment scores of those |M| mood words.In particular, we use ANEW (Bradley and Lang,1999), which is a set of 1034 sentiment convey-ing English words.
The valence and arousal ofmoods are assigned by those of the same wordsin the ANEW lexicon.
For those moods which arenot in ANEW, their values are assigned by thoseof the nearest father words in the mood hierarchi-cal tree1, where those moods conveying the samemeaning, to some extent, are in the same level ofthe tree.
Thus, each member of the mood clusterscan be placed onto the a 2D representation alongthe valence and arousal dimensions, making it fea-sible to compare with the core-affect model (Rus-sell, 2009) theorized by psychologists.3.2 Mood and ANEW Usage AssociationTo study the statistical strength of an ANEW wordwith respect to a particular mood, the informationgain measure (Mitchell, 1997) is adopted.
Givena collection of blog posts B consisting of thosetagged or not tagged with a target class attributemood m. The entropy of B relative to this binaryclassification isH(B) = ?p?log2(p?)?
plog2pwhere p?and pare the proportions of theposts tagged and not tagged with m respectively.The entropy of B relative to the binary classifi-cation given a binary attribute A (e.g.
if the wordA present or not) observed is computed asH(B|A) =|B?||B|H(B?)
+|B||B|H(B)where B?is the subset of B for which attributeA is present in the corpus and Bis the subset ofB for which attribute A is absent in the corpus.The information gain of an attribute ANEW A inclassifying the collection with respect to the targetclass attribute mood m, IG(m,A), is the reductionin entropy caused by partitioning the examples ac-cording to the attribute A. Thus,IG(m,A) = H(B)?H(B|A)With respect to a given mood m, those ANEWhaving high information gain are considered likelyto be associated with the mood.
This measure, alsooften considered a term-goodness criterion, out-performs others in feature selection in text cate-gorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).1http://www.livejournal.com/moodlist.bml4 Experimental Results4.1 Mood PatternsWe use a large Livejournal blogpost dataset, whichcontains more than 17 million blogposts taggedwith the predefined moods.

We learn that nearlyall members in the same patterns express a com-mon affect concept.
Those moods in the patternswith cheerful, pensive, and rejuvenated as the ex-emplars are mostly located in the first quarter ofthe affect circle (00?
900), which should containmoods being high in both pleasure and activationmeasures.
Meanwhile, many members of the an-gry and aggravated patterns are found in the sec-ond quarter (900?
1800), which roughly meansthat those moods express the feeling of sadness inthe high of activation.
The patterns with the ex-emplars nauseated and tired contain a majority ofmoods found in the third quarter (1800?
2700),which could be representatives for the mood fash-ion of sadness and deactivation.
In addition, thegrateful group could be a representative for moodswhich are both low in pleasure and in the degreeof activation (2700?
3600of the affect circle).Thus, the clustering process based on the ANEWusage could separate moods having similar affectscores into corresponding segments in the circleproposed in (Russell, 2009).To visualize mood patterns that have been de-tected, we plot these emotion modes on the affectcircle plane in Figure 4.
For each pattern, the va-lence and arousal are computed by averaging ofthe values of those moods in the quarter wheremost of the members in the pattern are.To further visualize the similarity of moods,the ANEW usage vectors are subject to a classi-cal multidimensional scaling (Borg and Groenen,Mood Top ANEW words associatedCheerfulfun, happy, hate, good, christmas,merry, birthday, cute, sick, loveHappyhappy, hate, fun, good, birthday,sick, love, mind, alone, boredAngryangry, hate, fun, mad, love, anger,good, stupid, pretty, movieP*ssedoffhate, stupid, mad, love, hell, fun,good, god, pretty, movieGloomysad, depressed, hate, wish, life,alone, lonely, upset, pain, heartSadsad, fun, heart, upset, wish,funeral, hurt, pretty, loved, cancer(a) Moods and the most associated ANEW wordsANEWMost likelymoodsLeast likelymoodsDesirecontemplative,thoughtfulenraged,drainedAnger angry, p*ssed offnauseated,gratefulAccident sore, boredexanimate,indifferentTerrorist angry, cynicalrejuvenated,touchedWine drunk, p*ssed off ditzy, okay(b) ANEW words and the most associated moodsTable 1: Mood and ANEW correlation2005) (MDS) and a hierarchical clustering.

The occurrence ofsome ANEW having valence much different withthe tagging mood, e.g.
the ANEW hate in theposts tagged with cheerful or happy moods, mightbe the result of a negation construction used in thetext or of other context.For a given ANEW, the most likely moodstagged to the blog posts containing the word aresimilar with the word in the affective scores.
Inaddition, the least likely moods are much differ-ent with the ANEW in the affect measure.
A plotof top ANEWs used in the blogposts is shown inFigure 5.Other than the ANEW conveying abstract con-cept, e.g.
desire or anger, those ANEW expressingmore concrete existence, e.g.
terrorist or accident,might be a good source for learning opinions fromsocial network towards the things.
In the corpus,the posts containing the ANEW terrorist are mostlikely tagged with angry or cynical moods.
Also,the posts containing the ANEW accident are mostlikely tagged with bored and sore moods.5 Conclusion and Future WorkWe have investigated the problems of emotion-based pattern discovery and mood ?
affective lex-icon usage correlation detection in blogosphere.We presented a method for feature representationbased on the affective norms of English scores us-age.
We then presented an unsupervised approachusing Affinity Propagation, a nonparametric clus-tering algorithm that does not require the numberof clusters a priori, for detecting emotion patternsin blogosphere.
The results are showing that thoseautomatically discovered patterns match well withthe core-affect model for emotion, which is inde-pendently formulated in the psychology literature.In addition, we proposed a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover mood?lexicon cor-relation in blogosphere, giving hints on predictingmoods based on the affective lexicon usage andvice versa in the social media.
Our results couldalso have potential uses in sentiment-aware socialmedia applications.Future work will take into account the temporaldimension to trace changes in mood patterns overtime in blogosphere.
Another direction is to inte-grate negation information to learn more cohesiveassociation in affect scores between moods and af-fective words.
In addition, a new affective lexiconcould be automatically detected based on learningcorrelation of the blog text and the moods tagged.ReferencesI.
