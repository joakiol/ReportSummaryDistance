Weexplore the idea that this effect may be an emer-gent property of a computationally rational eye-movement strategy that is navigating a tradeoff be-tween processing immediate perceptual input, andcontinued processing of past input based on mem-ory.
We present an adaptive eye-movement con-trol model with a minimal capacity for such pro-cessing, based on a composition of thresholded se-quential samplers that integrate information fromnoisy perception and noisy memory.
The modelis applied to the List Lexical Decision Task andshown to yield frequency spillover?a robust prop-erty of human eye-movements in this task, evenwith parafoveal masking.
We show that spillover inthe model emerges in approximately optimal con-trol policies that sometimes process memory ratherthan perception.
We compare this model with onethat is able to give priority to perception over mem-ory, and show that the perception-priority policiesin such a model do not perform as well in a rangeof plausible noise settings.
We explain how thefrequency spillover arises from a counter-intuitivebut fundamental property of sequenced thresholdedsamplers.1 Introduction and overviewOur interest is in understanding how eye-movements are controlled in service of linguis-tic tasks involving reading?more specifically,how saccadic decisions are conditioned on themoment-by-moment state of incremental percep-tual and cognitive processing.
The phenomenawe are concerned with here are spillover effects,where fixation durations on a word are affected bylinguistic properties of the prior word or words.The specific idea we explore is that spillover ef-fects may be emergent properties of a computa-tionally rational control strategy that is navigatinga tradeoff between processing immediate percep-tual input, and continued processing of past inputbased on a memory of recent stimuli.The paper is organized as follows.
We firstreview evidence that eye-movement control inreading is strategically adaptive, and describe ourtheoretical approach.
We then review evidencefrom gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigms?some existing and some new?that suggests thatfrequency spillover is not driven exclusively byparafoveal preview of upcoming words.
We takethis as evidence that frequency spillover may bedriven in part by processing of words that con-tinues after the eyes have moved away.
We thenextend an existing adaptive control model of eye-movements with a minimal capacity for such con-tinued processing, by allowing it to process amemory of past input.
The model is based ona simple composition of thresholded sequentialsamplers that integrate information from noisyperception and noisy memory.
Threshold parame-ters define the control policy and their values de-termine how processing resources are allocatedto perception and memory.
We provide a com-putational rationality analysis of the model?s pol-icy space: First, we show that frequency spilloveremerges in top-performing policies, where perfor-mance is evaluated on the same task and payoffgiven to human participants.
Second, we showthat a model capable of spillover does no worsethan an otherwise identical model that can elim-inate spillover by always attending to perceptionwhen it can, and that the spillover-capable poli-cies in such a model do no worse than spillover-incapable ones across the speed-accuracy tradeoffcurve, and in fact do better in some portions ofthe noise parameter space.
Finally, we trace theorigin of the effect to a counter-intuitive but fun-damental property of the dynamics of sequencedthresholded samplers.2 Adaptive control of eye-movements:Evidence and theoretical approachA growing body of evidence suggests that eye-movements in reading are strategic adaptationsthat manifest at the level of individual fixations.For example, Rayner and Fischer (1996) showed1that when participants are searching for a partic-ular word in a text rather than reading for fullcomprehension, saccade durations are shortenedand the magnitude of frequency effects is reduced.Wotschack (2009) showed that readers assignedthe task of proofreading read more slowly and per-formed more second-pass reading with fewer skipsthan in a control reading-for-comprehension task.People also adapt reading behavior to within-task manipulations of difficulty and payoff.Wotschack (2009) showed that people changetheir reading behavior in response to manipula-tions of the difficulty of comprehension questions.Lewis et al.
(2013) showed that people adapt theireye movements in response to changes in quanti-tative task payoffs.
Payoffs emphasizing speed atthe expense of accuracy result in shorter fixationdurations and lower accuracies.We seek to develop a model that can explainsuch variation in eye-movement behavior as a ra-tional adaptation to the task (including utility) andthe internal oculomotor and cognitive architecture(Lewis et al., 2013).
Such a model would permit acomputational rationality analysis (Lewis et al., toappear) because the problem of rational behavioris defined in part by the bounded mechanisms ofthe posited computational architecture.We constrain our architectural assumptions bybuilding on existing theories of oculomotor archi-tecture, such as E-Z Reader (Reichle et al., 2009).But we enrich these architectures with explicit as-sumptions about the policy space of saccadic con-trol, and with assumptions about the processing ofnoisy perception and memory.
This enriched ar-chitecture is then embedded in a minimal cogni-tive system that is capable of performing a com-plete experimental task.
The complete model af-fords computational rationality analyses because itcan be used to derive the implications of saccadiccontrol policies for task performance.3 The nature of spillover effectsOur aim in this section is to establish a link be-tween spillover and the continued processing ofpast input based on memory.
Consider a pair ofwords in sequence: wordn?1and wordn.
Thereare three natural explanations for how the fre-quency of wordn?1could affect the duration offixations on wordn.
(1) During fixation of wordn,perceptual information from wordn?1is availablein the parafovea and continues to be processed.masked unmasked???????

Frequencies are binned by a mediansplit; error bars are bootstrapped standard errors.We call this the parafoveal review explanation.
(2) During fixation on wordn?1, perceptual infor-mation from wordnis available in the parafovea;the frequency of wordn?1affects the degree towhich this information is processed, and this inturns affects the subsequent fixation duration onwordn.
We call this the parafoveal preview expla-nation.
(3) During fixation of wordn, processingof wordn?1continues based on some memory ofthe perception of wordn?1, and this processing isaffected by the frequency of wordn?1.
We call thisthe memory explanation.It is unlikely that spillover is driven byparafoveal review because the effective visual fieldin reading does not extend to the left of the currentword (Rayner et al., 1980).The standard paradigm for investigating the re-lationship between spillover effects and parafovealpreview is some form of parafoveal masking(Rayner, 1975): a nonveridical preview of wordnis shown until the eye crosses an invisible bound-ary just before wordn, at which point wordnisshown.
When participants are not informed ofthe manipulation or do not notice it, they do notexhibit frequency spillover (Henderson and Fer-reira, 1990; Kennison and Clifton, 1995; White etal., 2005).
However, when participants are awareof preview being unavailable or not veridical, thespillover frequency effect remains (White et al.,2005; Schroyens et al., 1999).
These results sug-gest that parafoveal preview (or review) cannot bethe only explanation of spillover and therefore the2Figure 2: Example dynamics of a decision to saccade from wordn?1to wordn.
The memory-drivenattention shift decision can delay the start of perceptual sampling on the next word, potentially creatingspillover.
A detailed description of the dynamics depicted in this figure is in ?4.memory explanation warrants consideration.
Wenow summarize unpublished data consistent withthese findings in a simple linguistic task that wealso use to test the new model reported below.Spillover in the List Lexical Decision Task(LLDT).
We use the List Lexical Decision Task(LLDT) (Lewis et al., 2013), an extension of a taskintroduced by Meyer and Schvaneveldt (1971).
Inthe LLDT participants must determine whethera list of six strings contains all words, or con-tains a single nonword.
All strings are four char-acters in length and separated by six characterspaces.
The task was designed to require sequen-tial eye-movements and contact with the mentallexicon (but not higher-level linguistic process-ing), to minimize parafoveal processing (via thewide spacing), and to yield a high proportion ofsingle-fixation durations (via short strings).Two versions of the task were performed byseparate participant groups.
In the masked con-dition, we used a gaze-contingent moving windowparadigm wherein all strings but the fixated stringwere replaced with hashmarks (####).
In the un-masked condition, all six strings remained visible.Figure 1 shows the effects of word frequency onsingle fixation durations.
The main result of cur-rent interest is that frequency spillover is evidentin both conditions, despite the wide spacing in theunmasked condition, and the complete denial ofparafoveal preview in the masked condition.The work reviewed above and our new dataare consistent with an account of spillover inwhich both parafoveal preview (if available) andmemory-based processing are operative.
Our con-cern here is with the latter: understanding how anoisy memory of recently seen stimuli might beincorporated into an adaptive oculomotor architec-ture, and exploring whether rational exploitationof that memory might lead to spillover.4 A model of saccadic control with noisymemory for recent perceptionOur new model extends the one presented in Lewiset al.
(2013) to include a noisy memory thatbuffers perceptual input.
We develop it in the con-text of the LLDT, but its essential elements are nottied to this task.
It is most easily understood byfirst considering the dynamics of a single decisionto saccade from one word to the next, as presentedin Figure 2.
After describing these dynamics wesummarize the model?s key assumptions and asso-ciated mathematical specification.The dynamics of a decision to saccade fromwordn?1to wordn.
The eye first fixateswordn?1.
Some time passes before informationfrom the retina becomes available for perceptualprocessing (the eye-brain lag, EBL in Figure 2).
Asequence of noisy perceptual samples then arriveand are integrated via an incremental and noisyBayesian update of a probability distribution overlexical hypotheses in a manner described below.The perceptual samples are also buffered by stor-ing them in a memory that contains samples fromonly one word.
When the probability of one of thehypotheses reaches the saccade threshold, saccadeplanning is initiated.
Perceptual sampling (markedas free sampling in Figure 2 because its length isnot under adaptive control) continues in parallelwith saccade planning until the fixation ends, andthen for another EBL amount longer (these aresamples received at the retina during the fixationand only now arriving at the lexical processor).The model then switches to sampling from itsmemory, continuing to update the distribution overlexical hypotheses until one of the hypothesesreaches an attention shift threshold.
If this thresh-old had already been reached during the earlierperceptual sampling stages, attention shifts in-stantly.
Otherwise attention remains on wordn?1even if the eye has saccaded to wordn, and the eye-3brain lag on wordnis completed.
Perceptual sam-ples from wordnwill not be processed until atten-tion is shifted away from the memory-based pro-cessing of wordn?1.
Thus the memory processingon wordn?1may delay processing of perceptualsamples from wordn; perceptual samples arrivingduring this time are buffered in the memory.
Inthis way the posterior update is a limited compu-tational resource and its relative allocation to per-ception or memory is determined by the saccadeand attention shift thresholds.
To the extent thatthe time to reach the attention shift threshold issensitive to the frequency of wordn?1, the modelmay exhibit a spillover frequency effect.Lexical processing as rise-to-threshold deci-sionmaking.
The decisions to plan a saccade,shift attention, and make a motor response are re-alized as Multi-hypothesis Sequential ProbabilityRatio Tests (Baum and Veeravalli, 1994; Dragalinet al., 2000).
At each timestep, the model per-forms a Bayes update based on a noisy sampledrawn from perception or memory, with the pos-terior at each timestep becoming the prior for thenext timestep.
Our choice of word representationfollows Norris (2006) in representing a letter as aunit-basis vector encoding and a word as a con-catenation of such vectors.To generate a perceptual sample, mean-zeroGaussian perception noise with standard devia-tion (SD) ?pis added to each component of theword representation vector.
Each perceptual sam-ple is also stored in a memory buffer, and mem-ory samples are generated by uniformly draw-ing a stored sample from memory (with replace-ment), and adding an additional mean-zero Gaus-sian memory noise with SD ?mto each posi-tion.
Before each Bayesian update, whether us-ing a sample from perception or memory, mean-zero Gaussian update noise with SD ?uis added toeach component of the word representation vector.Thus a Bayes update from a perceptual sample in-cludes two noise terms, while a Bayes update froma memory sample includes three noise terms.
Allnoises are drawn independently.
The three SD?s,?p, ?mand ?u, are free parameters in the model,and we explore their implications below.The model uses the update specified in the ap-pendix in Lewis et al.
(2013) except for the noisegeneration specified above and the consequentchange in the likelihood computation.
The lexicalhypotheses are updated as follows:Prnew(Sk|sk, T ) =Pr(sk|Sk, T )Prold(Sk, T )?SPr(sk|Sk, T )Prold(Sk, T )(1)where skis a sample generated as above from theletterstring (word or nonword) in the current posi-tion k, Skis the hypothesis that the string at posi-tion k is S, and T is a multinomial distribution re-flecting the current belief of (a) whether this is anall-words trial and (b) otherwise, where the non-word is located.
The eye movement planning andattention shift decisions are conditioned on the dis-tribution of probabilities Pr(Sk) for all strings inthe current position.
When the maximum of theseprobabilities crosses a saccade planning threshold?s, saccade planning begins.
When the maximumcrosses the attention shift threshold ?a, attentionshifts to the next word1.
Each sample takes 10ms,a fixed discretization parameter.The likelihood of drawing perceptual or mem-ory sample s for a string S is computed from theunit-basis word representation as follows:Pr(s|S) =?if(si;?i, ?)
(2)where i indexes the unit-basis vector representa-tion of sample s and some true letterstring S (andso ?iis either 0 or 1), ?
is the sampling noise(dependent on whether the samples are memoryor perceptual samples as specified below), andf(x;?, ?)
is the probability density function of thenormal distribution with mean ?
and standard de-viation ?.We simplify the likelihood computation formemory samples by treating the perception andmemory samples as independent.
For presentpurposes this assumption may be treated as abound on the architecture.
The ?
in Equa-tion 2 is?
(?2p+ ?2u) for perceptual samples and?
(?2p+ ?2m+ ?2u) for memory samples.
At eachsample the string-level probabilities in each posi-tion are aggregated to the multinomial trial-leveldecision variable T as described above.
Given Tthe model computes the probability of a word trialPr(W) or nonword trial Pr(N ) = 1 ?
Pr(W).When either of these probabilities exceeds the mo-tor response threshold ?r, motor response plan-ning commences.1Because there is a fixed set of memory samples available,the attention shift decision is not guaranteed to converge, un-like the saccade threshold.
It nearly always converges, but weuse a 30-sample deadline to prevent infinite sequences.40.5 1.5 2.5??????????????????????????????????????????????

On each distinct machine defined by a combination of noise settings, policies(settings of ?s, ?m, ?r) were evaluated by the same task payoff given to human participants in the exper-iment described in ?3.
Boxplots show spillover effects of the top-performing 5% of policies.
Spillovereffects are the difference in mean single fixation durations on wordnwhen wordn?1is low frequencyand when wordn?1is high frequency (low/high determined by median split).
The highest noise settingsin the bottom row are not shown because performance was near-chance even for the best policies.The prior probability of an all-words trial is 0.5,so the prior probability of a word in each positionk is 1?0.56.
Therefore, we set the prior probabili-ties of words in each position to corpus frequencycounts (Ku?cera and Francis, 1967), normalized tosum to this value, 1 ?0.56.
Nonword probabilitiesare uniformly distributed over the remainder,0.56.Oculomotor and Manual Architecture.
Theremainder of the architectural parameters are stagedurations that are simulated as gamma deviateswith means based on previous work or indepen-dently estimated from data.
The key parametersfor present purposes are the 50ms mean eye-brainlag and 125ms saccade planning time, followingReichle et al.
(2009), and the 40ms mean sac-cade execution time, based on estimates from ourown human participants.
The standard deviationof each distribution is 0.3 times the mean.
Wetransform the means and standard deviations intoscale and shape parameters for a Gamma distri-bution and then draw duration values from theseGammas independently for every word and trial.5 A computational rationality analysisWe explore whether spillover effects might be asignature of computationally rational behavior intwo ways.
First, we evaluate a space of policies(parameterized by ?s, ?m, ?r) against the task pay-off given to our human participants, and show thattop-performing policies yield frequency spilloverconsistent with human data, and poor-performingpolicies do not.
Second, we extend the model?spolicy space to allow it to prioritize perceptionover memory samples when both are available(eliminating spillover in those policies), and showthat the spillover portions of the policy space per-form better than non-spillover ones under any im-posed speed-accuracy tradeoff in plausible noisesettings, and never perform worse.In computational rationality analyses, we dis-tinguish between policy parameters, fixed archi-tecture parameters, and free architecture parame-ters.
Policy parameters are determined by select-ing those policies that maximize a given task pay-off, given the hypothesized architectural bounds.Fixed architecture parameters are based on pre-vious empirical or theoretical work.
Free archi-tecture parameters can be fit to data or exploredto show the range of predictions with which themodel is compatible.
We focus here on the lat-ter, showing not only that the model is compatiblewith human data, but that it is incompatible withresults significantly different from the human data.Our first evaluation of the model asks the ques-tion of whether we see spillover effects emergingin approximately optimal policies under our as-sumptions about mechanism and task.
We eval-uated our model in the LLDT, under the balancedpayoff presented in Lewis et al.

We ex-plored a discretized policy space as follows: we let?srange between 0.199 and 0.999 in steps of 0.05;?mbetween 0.19999 and 0.99999 in steps of 0.05,and also include ?m= 0 which prevents memorysampling; and ?rbetween 0.599 and 0.999 in stepsof 0.1.
We explored all 1530 permutations.Figure 3 shows the distribution of spillover ef-fect sizes in the top 5% of policies (evaluated bytask payoff, not fit to human data), for a rangeof noise parameter settings (at higher noise set-tings, even the best policies are close to chanceperformance).
The top 5% of policies average 7.78points per trial across the noise and policy range,and the bottom 50% average 1.32 points.
The fig-ure shows that top-performing policies show lit-tle to no spillover when update noise is low, posi-tive but small spillover effects when update noiseis moderate, and sizable positive spillover effectswhen update noise is relatively high.
These resultsare consistent with spillover as a rational adapta-tion to belief update noise.Figure 4 (left panel) shows normalized spillovereffects (the ratio of the wordn?1frequency effectto the wordnfrequency effect) for the best poli-cies, the bottom 50% of policies, and the bestpolicies constrained with a memory threshold ofzero (?m= 0).
When ?m= 0, the spillover ef-fect is zero as expected.
The top performing poli-cies in the unconstrained space generate nonzerospillover effects that are consistent with the humandata, but the poor performing policies do not (Fig-ure 4, right panel).
We know that the top perform-ing policies exploit memory because they do yieldnonzero spillover effects, and the values of ?marenonzero for these policies.Our second evaluation asks whether a modelthat is constrained to always give priority to pro-cessing perceptual samples over memory sampleswill perform better than the present model, whichhas the flexibility to give priority to memory overperception.
To explore this, we added a single bi-nary policy parameter, the perceptual priority bit.If this bit is set, then the model has the choice be-tween memory sampling from wordn?1and per-ceptual sampling from wordn, it always choosesthe latter.
Such an option is not available in theprevious model?there is no setting of the saccadeand memory thresholds that will always use mem-ory samples when only they are available, but alsonever choose to use memory samples when per-ceptual samples can be used.
With the perceptualpriority bit set, the model is capable of exploitingthe least noisy samples available to it, but is inca-pable of exhibiting spillover effects.Figure 5 shows speed-accuracy tradeoffs forthe model, with the perceptual-priority bit not set(spillover-capable) and set (spillover-incapable),in three representative noise settings.

Each plot is labeled at the top with the noise setting (perceptual, memory, update).both spillover-capable and -incapable policies.
Inthe left plot of the figure, noise is low enough over-all such that responses are very fast and spillover-capable policies do no worse and no better thanspillover-incapable policies.
In the middle plot,update noise is higher, and the optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is better for the model that canyield spillover, consistent with the exploitation ofmemory sampling to mitigate update noise.
In theright plot, perception and memory noise are highenough that it is not useful to sample from mem-ory at the expense of perception.
All the noisesettings we explored (see Figure 3 for the range)yield one of these three patterns, or the uninter-esting case of near-chance performance.
In nosetting does the spillover-capable model performworse than the spillover-incapable one.
The noisesettings cover a range from implausibly-high ac-curacy to chance performance, and so we con-clude that spillover-capable policies dominate, inthat they do no worse, and occasionally do better,than those constrained to give priority to percep-tion over memory.6 Why spillover arises from sequencedthresholded samplersWe have demonstrated through simulations thatthe model yields frequency spillover through acomposed sequence of perception and memorysampling.
We have not yet addressed the ques-tion of how or why this happens.
Indeed, it is ini-tially somewhat puzzling that an effect of priors(set by lexical frequency) would persist after theinitial perceptual sampling threshold ?pis passed,because this fixed threshold must be exceeded nomatter the starting prior.The crucial insight is that it is not always thecase that the true word hypothesis reaches thethreshold first; i.e., the decision to initiate saccadeplanning may be based on (partial) recognition ofa different word than the true word.
In such cases,at the start of memory sampling, the hypothesis forthe true word is farther from the memory threshold?mthan if the true word had been (partially) recog-nized.
Incorrect decisions are more likely for lowfrequency words, so in expectation the memory-driven attention shift mechanism will start fartherfrom its threshold for low-frequency words, andtherefore take longer to reach threshold, delayingthe following word more.We constructed a minimal two-sampler exam-ple to clearly illustrate this phenomenon.
The left-most panel of Figure 6 illustrates the dynamics ofsuch a trial.
In this panel, the threshold is crossedfor the incorrect hypothesis (green line) in the firstsampler, triggering the start of the second sampler.The second sampler recovers from the mistake, al-lowing the correct (red) hypothesis to cross thethreshold, but at the cost of additional time.
Themiddle panel shows that incorrect (and thus eligi-ble for recovery) trials are more frequent for lowpriors.
The rightmost panel shows that the finish-ing time of the second sampler is proportional tothe prior probability of the correct hypothesis forthe first sampler.
It is also inversely proportionalto accuracy (middle plot), consistent with inaccu-rate trials driving the relationship between the firstsampler prior and second sampler finishing times.70 50 100 150 2000.00.20.40.60.81.0sampleprobabilitySampler 1 Sampler 2 lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll0.000.250.500.751.001e?05 1e?04 1e?03 1e?02 1e?01Starting prior of correcthypothesis (Sampler 1)Accuracy(Sampler1)Number of Hypothesesllll251001000lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll02550751e?05 1e?04 1e?03 1e?02 1e?01Starting prior of correcthypothesis (Sampler 1)Num.

Although weadopted a second MSPRT sampler, spillover mayarise from other processes with access to the pos-terior of the perceptual sampling, such that it canrecover from perceptually misidentified words.
Inthe present model we investigated the possibil-ity that post-perceptual memory-based processingcould be partially motivated by mitigating noisein the update process itself.
But it is almost cer-tainly the case that post-perceptual processing isrequired in the course of reading for indepen-dent reasons, and such processing could also yieldspillover frequency effects in a way that the mem-ory sampling process does.
(A challenge for suchan alternate process is that spillover effects per-sist in the LLDT in the absence of required higherlevel syntactic or semantic processing).A tradeoff between processing perception andmemory.
The serial queuing model is a simple re-alization (inspired by EZ-Reader (Reichle et al.,1998)) of a limited resource that can be allocatedto perceptual and memory processing, but an alter-native parallel attention machine might recover theresults, as long as it suffers from the same tradeoffthat processing the previous word from memorywill slow down processing of the fixated word.Direct oculomotor control.
In the present modelsaccade planning is triggered directly by the per-ceptual evidence accumulation process, and assuch is not obviously compatible with autonomoussaccade generation models like SWIFT (Engbertet al., 2005).
It may be possible to layer SWIFT?stime-delayed foveal inhibition over a sequentialsampling process, but we note that spillover ef-fects were part of the empirical motivation forsuch delayed control.The present model and results open several av-enues for future work.
These include the interac-tions of memory-based or post-perceptual process-ing with models of saccade planning that includesaccade targeting, re-targeting, and cancellation,as well as buttonpress behavior (e.g.
in the self-paced moving window paradigm).
The role thatparafoveal preview plays in spillover effects canalso be explored, including how the model (andthus human participants) might navigate the trade-off between using parafoveal preview information(noisy due to eccentricity) and using memory ofpast input in the service of a reading task.
Fi-nally, it is possible to explore the spillover expla-nation in an architecture capable of higher-levelsentence processing in service of different readingtask goals.AcknowledgmentsThis material is based upon work supported by theNational Science Foundation under Grant BCS-1152819 to RL and SB.
