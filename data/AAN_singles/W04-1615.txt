Thesystem is implemented as a HTTPclient/server application written in Perl.
It usesmodules implemented in an existingsummarizer geared towards the Germaniclanguages, a Persian stop-list in Unicodeformat and a small set of heuristic rules.1 IntroductionFarsiSum is an attempt to create an automatictext summarization system for Persian (Mazdak,2004).
The system is implemented as a HTTPclient/server application written in Perl.
It usesmodules implemented in SweSum (Dalianis 2000),a Persian stop-list in Unicode format and a smallset of heuristic rules.
The stop-list is a fileincluding the most common verbs, pronouns,adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions and articles inPersian.
The words not included in the stop-list aresupposed to be nouns or adjectives.
The idea is thatnouns and adjectives are meaning-carrying wordsand should be regarded as keywords.The current implementation of FarsiSum is still aprototype.
It uses a very simple stop-list in order tofilter and identify the important keywords in thetext.
Persian acronyms and abbreviations are notdetected by the current tokenizer.In addition, Persian syntax is quite ambiguous inits written form (Megerdoomian and R?mi 2000),which raises certain difficulties in automaticparsing of written text and automatic textsummarization for Persian.For example, selection of important keywordsin the topic identification process will be affectedby the following word boundary ambiguities:?
Compound words may appear as two differentwords.?
Bound morphemes may appear as freemorphemes or vice versa.These ambiguities are not resolved in the currentimplementation.2 SweSumSweSum1 (Dalianis 2000) is a web-basedautomatic text summarizer developed at the RoyalInstitute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden.
It usestext extraction based on statistical and linguistic aswell as heuristic methods to obtain textsummarization and its main domain is SwedishHTML-tagged newspaper text2.2.1 SweSum?s architectureSweSum is a client/server application.
Thesummarizer is located on the web server.
It takes aSwedish text as input and performs summarizationin three phases to create the final output (thesummarized text).HTTPWeb ServerWeb ClientApache HTTP ServerLexiconSummarizerSummarizedTextOriginal TextHTTP Client (Win Explorer/Netscape/Mac)Pass IIIPass IIPass ITokenizingScoringKeyword extractionSentence Ranking Summary Extraction12876543Figure 1: SweSum architecturePass 1: The sentence and word boundaries areidentified by searching for periods, exclamationand question marks etc (with the exception ofwhen periods occur in known abbreviations).
Thesentences are then scored by using statistical,linguistic and heuristic methods.
The scoringdepends on, for example, the position of thesentence in the text, numerical values in and1 An online demo is available athttp://swesum.nada.kth.se/index.html2 SweSum is also available for English, Danish,Norwegian, Spanish, French, German, and now with theimplementation described in this paper, Farsi.various formatting of the sentence such as bold,headings, etc.Pass 2: In the second pass, the score of eachword in the sentence is calculated and added to thesentence score.
Sentences containing commoncontent words get higher scores.Pass 3: In the third pass, the final summary file(HTML format) is created.
This file includes:?
The highest ranking sentences up to a pre-set threshold.?
Optionally, statistical information aboutthe summary, i.e.
the number of words,number of lines, the most frequentkeywords, actual compression rate etc.For most languages SweSum uses a staticlexicon containing many high frequent open classwords.
The lexicon is a data structure for storingkey/value pairs where the key is the inflected wordand the value is the stem/root of the word.
Forexample boy and boys have different inflectionsbut the same root (lemma).3 FarsiSumFarsiSum is a web-based text summarizer forPersian based upon SweSum.
It summarizesPersian newspaper text/HTML in Unicode format.FarsiSum uses the same structure used by SweSum(see Figure 2), with exception of the lexicons, butsome modifications have been made in SweSum inorder to support Persian texts in Unicode format.3.1 User InterfaceThe user interface includes:?
The first page of FarsiSum on WWWpresented in Persian3.?
A Persian online editor for writing inPersian.The final summary including statisticalinformation to the user, presented in Persian.3.2 Stop ListThe current implementation uses a simple stoplist rather than a full-fledged Persian lexicon.
Thestop-list is a HTML file (UTF-8 encoding)containing about 200 high-frequency Persianwords including the most common verbs,pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions andarticles.3 http://www.nada.kth.se/iplab/hlt/farsisum/index-farsi.htmlThe stop-list has been successively builtduring the implementation phase by iterativelyrunning FarsiSum in order to find the mostcommon words in Persian.The assumption is that words not included in thestop-list are nouns or adjectives (content words)and should be counted as such in the wordfrequency list.3.3 TokenizerThe tokenizer is modified in order to recognizePersian comma, semi colon and question mark.?
Sentence boundaries are found bysearching for periods, exclamation andquestion marks as well as <BR> (theHTML new line) and the Persian questionmark (?).?
The tokenizer finds the word boundariesby searching for characters such as ?.
?, ?,?,?!
?, ??
?, ?<?, ?>?, ?
:?, spaces, tabs andnew lines.
Persian semi colon, comma andquestion mark can also be recognized.?
All words in the document are convertedfrom ASCII to UTF-8.
These words arethen compared with the words in the stop-list.
Words not included in the stop list areregarded as content words and will becounted as keywords.The word order in Persian is SOV4, i.e.
the lastword in a sentence is a verb.
This knowledge isused to prevent verbs from being stored in theWord frequency table.3.4 ArchitectureFarsiSum is implemented as a HTTPclient/server application as shown in Figure 2.
Thesummarization program is located on the serverside and the client is a browser such as InternetExplorer or Netscape Navigator.SummarizedtextOriginal textTokenizingScoringKeyword ExtractionSentence rankingSummary extractionPass 1Pass 2Pass 3User InterfaceStop-listHTTPFarsiSumcod654321ArchitectureAlphabet Roman/PersianEncoding ASCII/UnicodeData Lexicon/Stop ListUnicodeUnicodeUni eUnicodeUnicodeASCIIASCIIFigure 1: FarsiSum architecture4 SOV stands for Subject, Object and Verb.The summarization process starts when the user(client) clicks on a hyperlink (summarize) on theFarsiSum Web site:?
The browser (Web client) sends asummarization request (marked 1 inFigure 2) to the Web server whereFarsiSum is located.

(The original textis in Unicode format).?
The document is summarized in threephases including tokenizing, scoring andkeyword extraction.
Words in thedocument are converted from ASCII toUTF-8.
These words are then comparedwith the words in the stop-list (2-5).?
The summary is returned back to theHTTP server that returns the summarizeddocument to the client (6).The browser then renders the summarized text tothe screen.4 ConclusionsThe system would most certainly benefit fromdeeper language specific analysis, but with noaccess to Persian resources, in this system fairlylanguage independent methods have proven tocome a long way.ReferencesDalianis, H. 2000.
