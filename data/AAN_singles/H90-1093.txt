PROGRESS REPORTActive Knowledge Structures in Natural Language UnderstandingComputing Research LaboratoryNew Mexico State UniversityContact: Yorick Wilksyorick@nmsu.edu(505) 646-1835Work on the project has concentrated in the last six months on (a) reimplemenfing ourtwo semantics-based message parsers and (b) integrating them with the KR formalismwe use: a form of conceptual graphs (CG) embedded in the MGR (Model GenerativeReasoning) framework.The PREMO (Preference Machine Organization) parser has been reimplemented,using a technique to adjust the weighting of word and structure preferences such that itcan be trained to systematicities in the special (--"ill-formed") syntax of a given mes-sage type.In the case of the other semantics-based parser PM, Jerry Ball took two of thetexts from the Navy message database and added the vocabulary from those messagesto the parser's lexicon.
After a small amount of modification, the parser was able toparse about 80% of the sentences in those two messages into reasonable r presentations.With some additional work this percentage can be improved.
Given the lexically drivennature of the parser, extending the system to cover a larger subset of the Navy messagedatabase rests primarily on expansion of the lexicon.
For demonstration purposes, an XWindows Interface to the parser was developed.We are also integrating the ViewGen belief manipulation system with the concep-tual graph + MGR knowledge representation, so as to provide a system that can bothguide the message parsers and represent the results of message xtraction.
The immedi-ate goal is re-implementing ViewGen in conceptual graphs.
This has led to the follow-ing recent developments:(1) Investigating the benefits of using CG to express ViewGen.
(2) Representing the environments, lambda formulas, and propositions of ViewGen inCG.
(3) Using examples from Navy messages to specify belief ascription in CG.421
