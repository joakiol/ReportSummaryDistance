An Algorithm for Determining TalkerLocation using a Linear MicrophoneArray and Optimal Hyperbolic FitHarvey F. SilvermanLaboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems (LEMS)Division of EngineeringBrown UniversityProvidence, RI 02912AbstractOne of the problems for all speech input is thenecessity for the talker to be encumbered by a head.mounted, hand-held, or fixed position microphone.
Anintelfigent, electronically-aimed unidirectional micro-phone would overcome this problem.
Array tech-niques hold the best promise to bring such a system topracticality.
The development of a robust algorithm todetermine the location of a talker is a fundamental is-sue for a microphone-array s stem.
Here, a two-steptalker-location algorithm is introduced.
Step 1 is arather conventional filtered cross-correlation method;the cross-correlation between some pair of micro-phones is determined to high accuracy using a some-what novel, fast interpolation on the sampled data.Then, using the fact that the delays for a point sourceshould fit a hyperbola, a best hyperbolic fit is obtainedusing nonlinear optimization.
A method which fits thehyperbola directly to peak-picked elays is shown tobe far less robust than an algorithm which fits the hy-perbola in the cross-correlation space.
An efficient,global nonlinear optimization technique, Stochastic re-gion Contraction (SRC) is shown to yield highly accu-rate (>90%), and computationally efficient, results fora normal ambient.IntroductionOne of the problems for all speech input is thenecessity for the talker to be encumbered by a hcad-mounted, hand-held, or fixed position microphone, or,perhaps, a technician-conlxolled mechanical unidirectionalmicrophone.
Whether for teleconferencing \[I\], speechrecognition \[2\], or large-room recording or conferencing\[3\], an intelligent, eleclronically-aimed unidirectional mi-crophone would overcome this problem.
Array tech-niques hold the best promise to bring such a system topracticality.Algorithms for passive tracking -- the determina-tion of range, bearing, speed, and signature as a functionof time for a moving object -- have been studied for near-ly 100 years partiomLqrly for radar and sonar systems.While there is currently much activity involved with thewacking of multiple sources using variants of theeigenvalue-hased decomposition MUSIC algorithm, \[4\],\[5\], \[6\], \[7\], \[8\], most systems till use correlational tech-niques \[9\], \[10\], [11\].The method presented here is also based on correla-tion.
First, a coarse, normalized cross-correlation func-tion is computed over the delay range of interest.
It turnsout that, even for the relatively high sampfing rate of20kHz, the 5Olas resolution of the time-delay estimatescauses derived locations to be unsatisfactory.
However,the latter may be refined by nearly two orders of magni-tude through accurate interpolation techniques which canbe attained for a relatively small computational usingmultirate filtering\[12\].For M microphones, one can estimate M-1 in-dependent relative delays.
As, theoretically, only two re-lative delays are needed to triangulate a source, for M >3,the system is overspecified.
However, since noise is al-ways present in a real system, this extra information canbe profitably used to overcome some of the effects of thenoise.
In fact, the geometry of the array constrains thevector of relative delays.
For example, a simple lineararray, with all the microphones on the axis, y=0, has de-lays constrained to be on a particular hyperbola with afocus on the target.
Therefore, errors in the estimation ofthe delays may be corrected by fitting the best hyperbola.Two methods for doing so are presented here.In the first method, Time-Delay Estimation, Hy-perbolic Fit (TDEHF), peak-picking is used on theresults of the interpolated cross-correlations to estimatethe individual time delays.
Then, constrained nonfincaroptimization is used to fit the best hyperbola through thesparse rime-delay estimations.
As the data turn out to bepretty much unimodal, gradient techniques \[13\] were usedto minimize a least-squares functional.
TDEHF sufferswhen original time-delay estimates exhibit large, and151often "dumb" errors.
TDEHF is introduced in Section 4.The second (and more robust) method InterpolatedCross-eorrelation Hyperbolic Fit (ICHF), fits the besthyperbola to the actual output of the interpolated cross-correlations.
As reasonable crosscorrelations are alwayspositive, the sum of the crosscorrelations across all themicrophones for a given hyperbola is used as a functionalto maximize.
As the functional surface is multimodal,results for a hierarchical grid search and for application ofStochastic Region Contraction (SRC), [14] , [IS], a newmethod for efficient global nonlinear optimization, arepresented.Coarse Cross-CorrelationConsider a linear microphone array having M mi-crophones, each located on the line y = O  at a distinctpoint (z,,O) in the x y  plane.
A simple case is to beconsidered in this paper in which a single some (talker)is located at some point (x,y) in frdnt of the array.although there will be ambient noise.
Without loss ofgenerality, microphone 1 is selected as the reference.
Itis assumed that the signal at each microphone is appropri-ately sampled at some reasonable rate, R and that eachmicrophone thus receives a signal of time (indexed by j).p:~).
As sources might be separable in the frequencydomain, one can, in general, filter each received signalusing a zero-phase FIR filter, this is the only reasonablechoice as delay estimation is yet to be performed.
Thisimplies,where f , G )  is a 2J+1 element symmetric FIR filter.
Itis advantageous, as will be seen later, to definerectangularly-windowed data, referenced to time index k',for the correlations as,O I I  IL-1otherwise (2.2)Each of the M-1 independent cross-correlations fora delay of k samples each of duration 1IR may bedefined,A,(k') L-1C:[k,k'I 7 x r :  (k '+l )$(k'+l +k), (2.3) L - lklwhere A,(k') is a normalizing factor.
A reasonable nor-malization is to make the autocorrelation of the unshiftedreference signal have a value of unity for any particulartime reference k ',Combining (2.3) and (2.4) gives,which generalizes to,Computational Considerations for the Cross-CorrelationsAn important consideration is the selection of L.the number of points in the crosscorrelation.
When auto-correlations are taken for LPC analysis, the length is lim-ited by the assumption that the vocal tract is essentiallystationary over the interval.
As one is not doing thispseudo-stationary modeling of the vocal tract, this factdoes not limit L here.
Rather, the tradeoff between infor-mation content - tending to make one increase L - andcomputational load -- tending to make one decrease L --governs this decision.
For the typical human talker, com-puting a position about five times per second is sufficient.With no redundancy, selecting L to correspond to 100-200ms of data is reasonable, as the experimental datashow.The range of the correlations, [-K-, K+], may bedetermined from the sample rate and the geometry shownin Figure 1 for a onedimensional array.

K- = K+ andR K- = K+ = rkngth -cos(O)-1.C (2.7)where c is the speed of sound with value about 342M/s.Small RoomGeometry for K+IFigure 1: Geometry for Computing K+&-, the Worst-Case delays(4.0)As an example, consider a one-dimensional array oflength one meter, a room four meters wide, one-half me-ter of "block-out space" and a sampling rate of 20,000samples-per-second.
For this case, correlations will re-quire 2000 multiplication-addition operations for lOOmsecof data.
As the maximum relative delay may be seen tobe 1'C0S140 = 2.84m.s.
Equation (2.7) yieldsCK- = K+ = 57.
Thus, the correlation phase requiresMike M I .

For eight micro-phones, about 160 ms would be required, and the locationcould be computed in real-dine for the required five up-dates per second.The relative delay between each microphone and itsreference could be estimated by selecting the highest po-sitive point in the correlation outputs, i.e.,k=* -= argmin C~\[k,k'\], (2.8)-.K_ ~l ~K+k:, (2.9) d, tk q - "T'where d,~ \[k'\] is defined to be the delay, relative to micro-phone 1, for microphone m. Note that the accuracy isonly to that of the sample rate, and that this simple peak-picking algorithm is subject to serious errors when realdata are used!Interpolation for Higher AccuracyEven for the relatively high (for speech) samplingrate of 20kHz, estimation accuracy of the tracking posi-tion is inadequate; a variation of more than one meter inthe y dimension is the norm for talkers two meters direct-ly in front of the microphone.
Experience has shown thatan acceptable region of uncertainty may be achieved for asampling inteerval of about llas.The most straightforward way to achieve the need-ed high resolution would be to sample at a much higherrate, R" -- around 1MHz - and perform the correlationson the data, i.e.,C,~'\[k,kq= B.

For an appropriately anti-aliased speech signal,one would be dealing with greatly oversampled signals.Thus, with no loss in accuracy, one could generate thesignal at sampling rate R '  from the signal sampled at rateR by the simplest standard multirate method ifR" -= Z'R, (3.2)where 2~ is an integer greater than 1.The proof for computationally efficient interpola-tion is given in \[17\].

Then the range of oiand 02 is only 11.
Thus (11)(11)(64) = 7744 storage lo-cations are required.The number of multiplication-additions is(11)2= 121 to compute the cross-correlation for each in-terpolated point.
One should note that this number is afar cry from the "direct" method in which, for L = 2000,(621)(64)(2000) = 80,000,000 operations had to be doneto get each interpolated signal and (64)(2000) = 128,000operations had to be done for each interpolated cross-correlation!Best Hyperbolic Fit AlgorithmsTriangulationIn binaural hearing, both amplitude and phase infor-marion is fed to the ~ and is used -- expertly -- todetermine the location of a sound source.
If the phase in-formation -- the delay estimates - alone were to be usedto determine location of a source, a minimum of threemicrophones i required for this "triangulation" procedure.If microphone 1 is considered to be the reference, and d2and d3 the time delays for microphones 2 and 3 respec-tively, relative to the arrival at microphone 1, then the es-timation of the source location xo, Yo may be determinedfrom,?

These relativelyugly, nonlinear expressions tend to be very sensitive tovariations due to noise in the estimates of d2 and d3.153T ime-De lay  Est imat ion,  Hyperbo l ic  Fit(TDEHF)For the case of the linear array, where the micro-phones are all considered to be on y=0, the locus of therelative delays for points along this line forms a hyperbo-la.
This is clear from Figure 2 in which the relative de-lay loci are plotted for various point-source locations(x,y).
At (zm,0), the absolute delay d= may be comput-ed from the Pythagorean Theorem asdm - "~\ ] (X -z2)+y2 (4.3)C,and, relative to microphone 1,d,~ = ~l(x-zm)2+y2 dr. (4.4)CSome algebra yields,(d,~+dl) 2 - (Zm-X)2 = ~ (4.5)C 2 C 2 "The points (z=,d.)
lie on a hyperbola parameterized bythe speed of sound, c, and the location of the source,(x,y).
Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between aspecific hyperbola and a source-point (x,y) located infront of the array -- there is a mirror in back of the array.The task, then, is to fit the best member of this class, thebest hyperbola, to the set of relative delay estimateszmd,~'\[l~'\], where m e \[2,M\].

As this sur-face is normally unimodal, a gradient method \[18\] hasbeen used.Interpolated Cross -cor re la t ion  Hyperbo l i c  Fit( ICHF)When real data are used, it is often the case that thecross-correlation peak which must be determined inTDEHF is inappropriate.
This is due to 1) periodicity inthe signal, 2) room reverberations, and 3) noise.
A morerobust algorithm would clearly resdt ff the specific deter-mination of the delays did not have to be explicitly done.In ICHF, one tries to determine the "optimal:fit" hyperbo-la in the cross.correlation space itself; thus, no patternrecognition errors are made prior to the optimization.Plots for real data are presented in Figures 3 and 4.In each case, the d at~ are produced by a loud talker si-tuated at (1M,2M) with low ambient noise.
In Figure 3,TDEHF worked well, as the peaks are relatively easy topick correctly.
In Figure 4, however, TDEHF yieldedpoor results, although it is evident hat a hyperbolic fit inthe cross-correlation space itself could give the right loca-tion.6.8 8.88.6~ o.2.~,2Figure 3: Example of Correlation Space where TDEHFSucceedsIn nonlinear optimization, one must develop a func-tional that measures "goodness (badness)" as a function ofthe set of variables over which one wants to optimize.
Inthis case, one wants to develop a measure of the average"goodness" of a particular hyperbola parametefized by(x,y) over the space shown in Figures 3, 4 having in-dependent variables of x, the x spatial variable, and if,the relative delay.
Points for the microphones (z,,,,d,,)may be computed from Equations 4.3 and 4.4; thisguarantees they all lie on a unique hyperbola.

A three dimen-sional plot of the surface for E (k 3 is given in Figure 5.Notice the strong peaking due to the hyperbolic-fittransformation.ResultsSome preliminary results for one loud talker stand-ing at (1M,2M) with a low ambient are shown in Figures6 and 7.
A linear array of eight microphones was usedfor all cases.
For these Figures, an algorithm was as-sumed to have c(rrecfly located the talker ff it indicated alocation within the rectangular region from 1.9M to 2.1Min x and 1.5M to 2.5M in y.
As algorithms have im-proved, the measure of "correctness" is also to be refinedin further work.
In both TDEHF and ICHF, the tendencyis for better per fo rmance  when larger-size cross-correlations are used, although there seems to be no rea-son to go beyond 3500 samples (175ms).
It is also clearthat ICHF is far more robust than is TDEHF.
Further-more, as might be expected, one gets improved perfor-mance using bandpass-filtered data.

Therefore, it is ex-pected that, in regions where the algorithm fails --perhaps in silence or a high-ambient interval -- the valueof E\[k'\] would be low and the incorrect location wouldnot be accepted.
Given this thresholding, one would ex-pect to almost always get an accurate prediction of atalker's location, providing no other talkers are competingacoustically, a case not yet studied.Computationally, ICHF is implementable in real-time due to the use of Stochastic Region Contraction \[14\]for the nonlinear optimization.

In an uncontested acoustic environment, prel-iminary results from real data indicate that highly accu-rate performance is achievable.
In addition, the SRCmethod for nonlinear optimization has provided amechanism for making the algorithm practical in realtime.
