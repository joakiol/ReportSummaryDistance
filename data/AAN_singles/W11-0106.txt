A Model for Composing Semantic RelationsEduardo Blanco and Dan MoldovanHuman Language Technology Research InstituteThe University of Texas at Dallas{eduardo,moldovan}@hlt.utdallas.eduAbstractThis paper presents a model to compose semantic relations.
The model is independent of anyparticular set of relations and uses an extended definition for semantic relations.
This extended def-inition includes restrictions on the domain and range of relations and utilizes semantic primitivesto characterize them.
Primitives capture elementary properties between the arguments of a relation.An algebra for composing semantic primitives is used to automatically identify the resulting rela-tion of composing a pair of compatible relations.
Inference axioms are obtained.
Axioms take asinput a pair of semantic relations and output a new, previously ignored relation.
The usefulness ofthis proposed model is shown using PropBank relations.
Eight inference axioms are obtained andtheir accuracy and productivity are evaluated.
The model offers an unsupervised way of accuratelyextracting additional semantics from text.1 IntroductionSemantic representation of text is an important step toward text understanding, performing inferencesand reasoning.
Potentially, it could dramatically improve the performance of several Natural LanguageProcessing applications.Semantic relations have been studied in linguistics for decades.
They are unidirectional underlyingconnections between concepts.
For example, the sentence The construction slowed down the trafficencodes a CAUSE and detecting it would help answer the question Why is traffic slower?In Computational Linguistics, there have been several proposals to detect semantic relations.
Currentapproaches focus on a particular set of relations and given a text they output relations.
There havebeen competitions aiming at detecting semantic roles (i.e., relations between a verb and its arguments)(Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005), and between nominals (Girju et al, 2007; Hendrickx et al, 2009).In this paper, we propose a model to compose semantic relations to extract previously ignored rela-tions.
The model allows us to automatically obtain inference axioms given a set of relations and is notcoupled to any particular set.
Axioms take as their input semantic relations and yield a new semanticrelation as their conclusion.Consider the sentence John went to the shop to buy flowers.
Figure 1 shows semantic role annotationwith solid arrows.
By composing this basic annotation with inference axioms, one can obtain the relationsshown with discontinuous arrows: John had the intention to buy, the buying event took place at the shopand John and the flowers were at some point in the shop.JohnAGENT99AT-LOCe b ++\ YwentAT-LOC77to the shop to buyPURPOSEccAT-LOCTX[tt cfINTENTNPSUXZ]xxbdgilnqflowersTHEMEffAT-LOCQSVXZwwdfhkmFigure 1: Semantic representation of the sentence John went to the shop to buy flowers.452 Semantic RelationsSemantic relations are the underlying relations between concepts expressed by words or phrases.
In otherwords, semantic relations are implicit associations between concepts in text.In general, a semantic relation is defined by stating the kind of connection linking two concepts.
Forexample, Hendrickx et al (2009) loosely define ENTITY-ORIGIN as an entity is coming or is derived froman origin (e.g., position or material) and give one example: Earth is located in the Milky Way.
We findthis kind of definition weak and prone to confusion.Following Helbig (2005), we propose an extended definition for semantic relations, including seman-tic restrictions for its domain and range.
For example, DOMAIN(AGENT) must be an animate concreteobject and RANGE(AGENT) must be a situation.Moreover, we propose to characterize relations by semantic primitives.
Primitives indicate if a certainproperty holds between the arguments of a relation.
For example, the primitive temporal indicates if thefirst argument must happen before the second in order for the relation to hold.
This primitive holds forCAUSE (a cause must precede its effect) and it does not apply to PART-WHOLE since the later relationdoes not consider time.Besides having a better understanding of each relation, this extended definition allows us to create amodel that automatically obtains inference axioms for composing semantic relations.
The model detectspossible combinations of relations and identifies the conclusion of composing them.Formally, we represent a relation R as R(x, y), where R is the relation type and x and y are the firstand second argument respectively.
R(x, y) should be read x is R of Y. DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R) are thesorts of concepts that can be part of the first and second argument respectively.
Any ontology can be usedto define domains and ranges, e.g., Helbig (2005) defined one to define a set of 89 relations.
Primitivesare represented by an array PR of length n, where n is the number of primitives and P iR indicates thevalue R takes for the ith primitive.The inverse of R is denoted R?1 and can be obtained by simply switching the arguments of R. GivenR(x, y), R?1(y, x) always holds.
We can easily define R?1 given the definition for R: DOMAIN(R?1) =RANGE(R), RANGE(R?1) = DOMAIN(R), and PR?1 is defined according to the fourth column of Table1 for each primitive, i.e., ?i ?
[1, n] : P iR?1 = Inverse(P iR).2.1 Semantic PrimitivesRelation primitives capture deep characteristics of relations.
Huhns and Stephens (1989) define them as:They [primitives] are independently determinable for each relation and relatively self-explanatory.They specify a relationship between an element of the domain and an element of the rangeof the semantic relation being described.Relation primitives are fundamental properties that cannot be explained using other primitives; they areelemental.
They specify basic attributes of a relation by stating if a particular property must hold bydefinition between the domain and range.Each relation takes a value for each primitive from the set V = {+,?, 0}, where ?+?
indicates thatthe property holds, ???
that it does not hold and ?0?
that it does not apply.
For example, the primitivevolitional indicates if a relation requires volition between domain and range.
AGENT takes as value +for this primitive and PART-WHOLE takes 0.Primitives complement the definition of a relation by stating if a particular property holds between itsarguments.
They help to understand the inter-relation differences and clustering relations.
Primitives canbe used as conditions to be fulfilled in order to determine if a potential relation holds.
They are generalenough to be determined for a relation, not a particular instantiation.
In other words, they state propertiesthat hold for all instances of a relation by definition.Our set of primitives (Table 1) is inspired on previous work in Knowledge Bases (Huhns and Stephens,1989).
We only select from them useful primitives for our purpose and add more primitives.
Theadditional primitives are justified by the fact that we aim at combining relations capturing semantics46No.

Whatever the set of chosen relations, it will describe the characteristics ofevents (who/when/where/how something happened), which elements were involved, connections be-tween events (e.g.
CAUSE, CORRELATION).
Time (whether an argument is guaranteed to happen beforethan the other), space and volition (whether or not there must be volition between the arguments) alsoplay an important role.The fourth column in Table 1 indicates the value of the primitive for the inverse relation.
Same meansthe inverse relation takes the same value, opposite means it takes the opposite.
The opposite of ?
is +,the opposite of ?

and P 7AGENT = +,i.e., AGENT(x, y) does not require x and y to be connected and it requires volition between the arguments.Note that PAGENT?1 = PAGENT.2.2 An Algebra for Composing Semantic RelationsThe key to automatically obtaining inference axioms is the ability to know beforehand the result ofcomposing semantic primitives using an algebra.
This way, one can identify prohibited combinations ofrelations and determine conclusions for the composition of valid combinations.47Given P iR1 and PiR2 , i.e., the values of R1 and R2 for a primitive pi, we define an algebra that indicatesthe result of composing them (i.e., P iR1 ?
P iR2).
Composing two primitives can yield three values: +, ?or 0, indicating if the primitive holds, does not hold or does not apply to the composition of R1 and R2.Additionally, the composition can be prohibited, indicated with ?.
After composing all the primitivesfor R1 and R2, we obtain the primitives values for the composition of R1 and R2 (i.e., PR1 ?
PR2).We define the values for the composition using a table for each primitive.
Table 2 depicts the wholealgebra.
The ith table indicates the rules for composing the ith primitive.
For example, regarding theintrinsic primitive, we have the following rules:?
If both relations are intrinsic, the composition is intrinsic;?
else if intrinsic does not apply to either relation, the primitive does not apply to the composition;?
else, the composition is not intrinsic.Other rules stated by the algebra are: (1) two relations shall not compose if they have differentopposite values for the primitive temporal; (2) the composition of R1 and R2 is not separable if eitherrelation is not separable; and (3) if either R1 or R2 are connected, then the composition is connected.3 Necessary Conditions for Composing Semantic RelationsIn principle, one could define axioms for every single possible combination of relations.
However, thereare two necessary conditions in order to compose R1 and R2:1.
They have to be compatible.
A pair of relations is compatible if it is possible, from a theo-retical point of view, to compose them.
Formally, R1 and R2 are compatible iff RANGE(R1) ?DOMAIN(R2) 6= ?.2.
A third relation R3 must fit as conclusion, that is, ?R3 such that DOMAIN(R3)?DOMAIN(R1) 6= ?and RANGE(R3) ?
RANGE(R2) 6= ?.Furthermore, PR3 must be compatible with the result of composing PR1 and PR2 .It is important to note that domain and range compatibility is not enough to compose two relations.For example, given KINSHIP(Mary, John) and AT-LOCATION(John, Dallas), no relation can be inferredbetween Mary and Dallas.4 Inference AxiomsAn axiom is defined as a set of relations called premises and a conclusion.
The composition operator ?is the basic way of combining two relations to form an axiom.
We denote an inference axiom as R1(x, y)?
R2(y, z) ?
R3(x, z), where R1 and R2 are the premises and R3 the conclusion.
In order to instantiatean axiom the premises must have an argument in common, y.In general, for n relations there are(n2)= n(n?1)2 different pairs.
For each pair, taking into accountthe two relations and their inverses, there are 4?
4 = 16 different possible combinations.We note that R1 ?
R2 = (R2?1 ?
R1?1)?1, reducing the total number of different combinations to10.
Out of these 10, (1) 4 combine R1, R2 and their inverses (Table 3); (2) 3 combine R1 and its inverse;and (3) 3 combine R2 and its inverse.
The most interesting combinations to use as premises for an axiomfall into category (1), since the other two can be resolved by the transitivity property of a relation and itsinverse.
Therefore, for n relations there are 2n2+n potential axioms:(n2)?4+3n = 2?n(n?1)+3n =2n2 ?
2n+ 3n = 2n2 + n.4.1 An Algorithm for Obtaining Inference AxiomsGiven a set of relations R defined using the extended definition, one can automatically obtain inferenceaxioms using the following steps for each pair of relations R1 ?

(i.e., prohibited).5 Case Study: PropBankPropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) adds a layer of predicate-argument information, or semantic role labels,on top of the syntactic trees provided by the Penn TreeBank.
Along with FrameNet, it is the resourcemost widely used for semantic role annotation.PropBank uses a series of numeric core roles (ARG0 - ARG5) and a set of more general roles, ARGMs(e.g.
MTMP, MLOC, MMNR).
The interpretation of the numeric roles is determined by a verb-specificframesets, although ARG0 and ARG1 usually correspond to the prototypical AGENT and THEME.
On theother hand, the meaning of AGRMs generalize across verbs.An example of PropBank annotation is the following: [Winston]ARG0 [procrastinated]rel [a lot]MADV[due to his nervous demeanor]MCAU.
Palmer et al (2005) discuss the creation of PropBank.
For moreinformation about the semantics of each role, we refer the reader to the annotation guidelines1.Since ARG2, AGR3, ARG4 and ARG5 do not have a common meaning across verbs, they become notcomposable.
For example, ARG2 is used for INSTRUMENT in the frameset kick.01 and for BENEFACTIVEin the frameset call.02.1http://verbs.colorado.edu/?m palmer/projects/ace/PBguidelines.pdf49R2R1 a:ARG0?1b:ARG1?1c:MLOC?1d:MCAU?1e:MTMP?1f:MPNC?1g:MMNR?1a: ARG0 = - - a - a -b: ARG1 - = - - - b -c: MLOC - - = c - c -d: MCAU a - c = e - -e: MTMP - - - e = e -f: MPNC a b c - e = gg: MMNR - - - - - g =Table 5: Results after applying the steps depicted in Section 4.1 using PropBank semantic roles.

RolesMEXT, MDIS, MADV, MNEG, MMOD, MDIR, are not composable because they encode a very narrowsemantic connection.
Manual examination of several examples leads to this conclusion.Table 4 depicts the primitives for the roles which are composable and their inverses.
Note that forany two relations their primitives are different.PropBank does not provide domains and ranges for its roles, although we can specify our own.
Wedo so by using the ontology defined by Helbig (2005).
All relations in PropBank are denoted as R(x, y),where x is an argument of y, and y is a verb.
The range of all relations is a situation.
The domain ofAGR0 and ARG1 are objects, the domain of MLOC and MTMP local and temporal descriptors respectively,the domain of MMNR qualities or states, and the domain of MPNC and MCAU are situations.5.1 Inference Axioms from PropBankOut of the four possible axioms between any pair of relations (Table 3), the only way to compose tworelations from PropBank is by using as common argument y a verb.
This restriction is due to the factthat PropBank exclusively annotates relations between a verb and its arguments.
Thus, the only possibleaxiom for any pair of roles R1 and R2 is R1(x, y) ?
R2?1(y, z) ?
R3(x, z), where y is a verb.Table 5 shows the eight inference axioms obtained after following the steps depicted in Section 4.1.Note that the matrix is symmetric as stated by the property R1 ?
R2 = (R2?1 ?
R1?1)?1.Some of the axioms obtained are:?
MCAU ?
MLOC?1 ?
MLOC?1, the location of a cause is the same than the location of its effect.?
MPNC ?
ARG0?1 ?
ARG0?1, the agent of an action is inherited by its purpose.?
MPNC ?
MMNR?1 ?
MMNR?1, the manner of an action is inherited by its purpose.5.2 EvaluationFirst, we evaluated all the instantiations of axiom MPNC ?
MMNR?1 ?
MMNR?1.
This axiom can beinstantiated 237 times using PropBank annotation, yielding 189 new MANNER not present in PropBank.The overall accuracy is 0.797, superior to state-of-the art semantic role labelers.Second, we have evaluated the accuracy of the eight inference axioms (Table 5).
Since PropBank isa large corpus, the amount of instantiations found for all axioms is too large to be checked by hand.
Wehave manually evaluated the first 1,000 sentences that are an instantiation of any axiom.
Since a sentencemay instantiate several axioms, we have actually evaluated 1,412 instantiations.
The first 1,000 sentenceswhich are an instantiation of any axiom are found within the first 31,450 sentences in PropBank.

Results are reportedboth using and not using the heuristic.
Productivity refers to the number of relations added by the axiom in relativeterms.Table 7 depicts the total number of instantiations for each axiom and its accuracy (columns 3 and4).
Accuracies range from 0.12 to 0.90, showing that the plausibility of an axiom depends on the axiom.The average accuracy for axioms involving MCAU is 0.53 and for axioms involving MPNC is 0.54.Axiom MCAU ?
ARG0?1 ?
ARG0?1 adds 201 relations, which corresponds to 0.89% in relativeterms.
Its accuracy is low, 0.40.
Other axioms are less productive overall, but have a greater relativeimpact and accuracy.
For example, axiom MPNC ?
MMNR?1 ?
MMNR?1, only yields 71 new MMNR,and yet it is adding 3.21% in relative terms with an accuracy of 0.82.It is worth noting that overall, applying the eight axioms used during evaluation adds 1,412 relationson top of the ones already present (2.26% in relative terms) with an accuracy of 0.54.5.3 Error AnalysisBecause of the low accuracy of axioms 1 and 5, an error analysis was performed.
We found that unlikeother axioms, these axioms often yield a relation type that is already present in the semantic representa-tion.
Specifically, axioms 1 and 5 often yield R(x, z) when R(x?, z) is already known.An example can be found in Figure 4, where axiom 5 yields ARG1(orders, to buy) when the relationARG1(the basket, to buy) is already present.
We use the following heuristic in order to improve theaccuracy of axioms 1 and 5: do not instantiate an axiom R1(x, y) ?
R2(y, z) ?
R3(x, z) if a relation ofthe form R3(x?, z) is already known.This simple heuristic allows us to augment the accuracy of the inferences at the cost of lowering theirproductivity.
The last three columns in Table 7 show results when using the heuristic.
The eight axiomsadd 840 relations (1.35% in relative terms) with an accuracy of 0.86.5.4 ExamplesIn this section we present several examples of instantiations.
We provide the full text of each example,but only the relevant semantic annotation for instantiating axioms.

Using the heuristic, all inferences are correct.6 Comparison with Previous WorkThere have been abundant proposals to detect semantic relations without taking into account compositionof relations.
All these approaches, regardless of their particular details, take as their input text and outputthe relations found in it.
In contrast, the framework proposed in this article obtains axioms that take astheir input relations found in text and output more relations previously ignored.Generally, efforts to extract semantic relations have concentrated on particular sets of relations or asingle relation, e.g.
CAUSE (Bethard and Martin, 2008; Chang and Choi, 2006) and PART-WHOLE (Girjuet al, 2006).
Automatic detection of semantic roles has received a lot of attention lately (Ma`rquez et al,2008; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005).
The SemEval-2007 Task 04 (Girju et al, 2007) and SemEval-2010Task 08 (Hendrickx et al, 2009) aimed at relations between nominals.
There has been work on detectingrelations within noun phrases (Moldovan et al, 2004; Nulty, 2007), clauses (Szpakowicz et al, 1995)and syntax-based comma resolution (Srikumar et al, 2008).Previous research has exploited the idea of using semantic primitives to define and classify semanticrelations under different names.
Among others, the literature uses relation elements, deep structure,aspects and primitives.
To the best of our knowledge, the first effort on describing semantic relations52using primitives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987).
They introduce Relation Element Theory,and differentiate relations by relation elements.
The authors describe a set of 31 relations clustered in fivegroups (CONTRAST, SIMILARS, CLASS INCLUSION, CASE-RELATIONS, PART-WHOLE), and distinguisheach relation by its relations elements and not just a definition and examples.
Their 30 relation elementsare clustered into five groups (elements of intensional force, dimension elements, elements of agreement,propositional elements, elements of part-whole inclusion).
They only use the elements to define relations,not to compose relations.Winston et al (1987) work with six subtypes of PART-WHOLE and uses 3 relation elements (func-tional, homeomerous and separable) to distinguish the subtypes.
Cohen and Losielle (1988) introducethe notion of deep structure and characterize it using two aspects: hierarchical and temporal.
Huhns andStephens (1989) extend previous works by considering an extended set of 10 primitives.In Computational Linguistics there have been previous proposals to combine semantic relations.Harabagiu and Moldovan (1998) manually extract plausible inference axioms using WordNet relations.Helbig (2005) transforms chains of relations into theoretical axioms.
On the other hand, the modelpresented in this paper extracts inference axioms automatically.Composing relations has been proposed before in the more general field of Artificial Intelligence,in particular in the context of Knowledge Bases.
Cohen and Losielle (1988) point out that two relationsshall combine if and only if they do not have contradictory values for the aspect hierarchical or temporal.They work with a set of nine specific relations (CAUSES, COMPONENT-OF, FOCUS-OF, MECHANISM-OF,PRODUCT-OF, PURPOSE-OF, SETTING-OF, SUBJECT-OF and SUBFIELD-OF) and their inverses.
Huhnsand Stephens (1989) are the first to propose an algebra for composing semantic primitives.
Unlike ours,their set of relations is not linguistically motivated; ten of them map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g.PIECE-OF, SUBREGION-OF).7 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have presented a model to compose semantic relations.
The model is independent ofany particular set of relations and is able to obtain inference axioms.
These axioms take as their inputtwo semantic relations and yield a previously ignored relation as conclusion.The model is based on an extended definition of semantic relations, including restrictions on domainsand ranges and values for a set of semantic primitives.
We have defined an algebra for composingsemantic primitives.
This algebra is the key to automatically identify the resulting relation of composinga pair of compatible relations and to form an axiom.The proposed algorithm to compose semantic relations identifies eight inference axioms using Prop-Bank relations.
When instantiated in a subset of PropBank, these axioms add 2.26% of annotation inrelative terms with an accuracy of 0.54.
We believe these results are worthwhile for a completely unsu-pervised approach to obtain semantic relations.
Adding a simple heuristic improves the accuracy to 0.86,lowering the productivity in relative terms to 1.35%.The model has limitations and is not always correct.
First, relations are defined manually and mis-takes could be made when assigning values to their primitives.
Second, the algebra for composingprimitives is also manually defined.We find the first problem easy to overcome.
Whatever the set of relations one might use, we believethinking in terms of primitives helps to understand the nature of the relations and their differences.
Anissue might be that the proposed set of primitives is not enough for a particular set, but more primitivescould be added to solve this eventuality.A further issue with the algebra is the fact that primitives are composed orthogonally.
This is asimplification, but we have shown that this simplified algebra works.Even though different sets of semantic relations may call for different ontologies to define domainsand ranges, and possibly an extended set of primitives, we believe the model presented in this paper isapplicable to any set.
As far as we are concerned, this is a novel way to compose semantic relations inthe field of Computational Linguistics.53ReferencesBethard, S. and J. H. Martin (2008).
