The NGC isnow part of Microsoft Word in the Office XPpackage released in 2001.  The goal of the NGCwas decided partly by that of the SwedishGrammar Checker (SGC, Arppe 2000 and Birn2000), designed to detect what were assumed tobe the errors of ?standard?
users, and partly by awish to include more linguistically advancedfeatures.
The kind of grammatical mistakesmade by linguistically ?non-standard?3 groupswas not taken into account, and this kind of toolobviously would be beneficial to these groups.Having provided an overview of the mainmethod behind the NGC, we will give a generaloverview of the kinds of errors that the NGC isdesigned to detect.
Then we will show how itperforms on various deviant language input1http://www.hf.uio.no/tekstlab/2The NGC was developed  for the Finnish companyLingsoft http://www.lingsoft.fi/.3Non-native spakers, deaf people, aphasics and dyslexics.
(essays written by Slav and Chinese students,and Norwegian deaf children).  	The NGC was developed using ConstraintGrammar (Karlsson et al 1995).
Like the SGCthe NGC has three main parts in addition to aninitial tokenizer (spell checking is performed at aprevious stage): A morphological analyser (NOBTWOL),which provides each word form with all of itslexically possible readings (grammatical tags). A morphological CG disambiguator, whicheliminates incorrect tags according to thegrammatical context (Karlsson et.
al 1995,Hagen, Johannessen and N?klestad 2000a and2000b). An error detector that identifies different kindsof grammatical errors.There is an interesting problemregarding the construction of a grammarchecker.
On the one hand it is necessary to haveas much grammatical information as possibleabout the particular text that is going to bechecked.
On the other hand, it is very difficult toperform any such grammatical analysis, sincegrammatical features (?errors?)
essential for theanalysis might be missing.
We tried to solve theproblem by relaxing many of the requirementsof the disambiguating tagger described above,since it was originally developed forgrammatically correct texts.
An example of thisis the original CG rule assigning a  determinerreading to a word that is next to a noun andagrees with it in number and gender:(01) (@w =!
(det neut)(0 DEF-DET)(*1 DEF-SG-NEUT-NOUN *L)(NOT LR0 NOT-ADJ-NOUN *L)(NOT *L NOT-ADV-ADJ))The rule (one of approximately 2000rules) says that if a word is definite and hasneuter determiner as one of its readings, butthere is a neuter definite singular noun to itsright, with nothing but adverbs and adjectives inbetween, then the determiner reading is correct.This rule ensures that the first word in thesentence below is correctly tagged as adeterminer and not e.g.
a pronoun:   eplet       likte han godtthe.DEF.NEUTER.SG apple.DEF.NEUTER.SG liked he well?That apple, he liked well.
?The tagger can then safely assume thatwhatever does not agree with the noun to itsright is not part of the same noun phrase, andtherefore is a pronoun.
However, a 	 can never assume that anything iscorrect, and cannot rely on the agreementfeatures of the determiner and the noun.
Instead,it ought to be able to detect any missingagreement and point out the error.
So the newrelaxed tagger leaves more ambiguity.
Instead,very specific error rules are introduced in theNGC.
Rule (03) below (one of 700 error rules)detects gender disagreement between adeterminer and the following noun (04).
(03) (@w =s!
(@ERR)(0 DET-DEF-NEUT)(NOT -1 DITRANS)(1C NOUN-SG-DEF)(NOT 1 NEUT)(1 MASC))(04)  *Jenta s?
det bilenThe.girl saw the.DEF.NEUT.SG car.DEF.MASC.SG'The girl saw that car.
'This method is reminiscent of that suggested bySchneider and McCoy (1998) for their ICICLEsystem designed to help second-languagelearners of English.
However, since theirs is agrammar based on context-free rules, it is moredifficult to implement; in order for a parse to besuccessful, all phrases have to be well-formed,which means that the grammar must includerules for ungrammatical structures.
CG has anadvantage; it does not have to build a full phrasestructure, thus partial parses are fine, and localerrors are easily detected.  !The NGC detects the following main error types:Noun phrase internal agreement:Definiteness  			Gender agreement   		Number agreement   Subject complement agreement		Negative polarity items   !""  #$errors (conjunction/ inf.

was 30%(70% of all alarms had to report true errors), andit performs well within that limit, with aprecision of 75% (Hagen, Johannessen and Lane2001), compared with 70% for the SGC (Birn2000).
The recall rate for the NGC has not beencalculated.The figures above were calculated on thebasis of texts written by advanced languageusers - mostly Norwegian and Swedishjournalists, with few errors in each text.
Most ofthe errors were not due to lack of knowledge ofNorwegian grammar, but rather to modern wordprocessing: too quick use of functions like cutand paste, insert etc.
For example,  two finitemodal verbs next to each other would not beuncommon.
However, one would assume thatless linguistically advanced users might benefitmore from this kind of tool.
In the next sectionswe shall evaluate the NGC on texts produced byvarious non-standard language users.

It can also be improved by addingmore morphological rules.This is similar to the error pattern of allthe other non-standard language groups we havestudied so far (Chinese Level III students, twolevels of Slav students and deaf Norwegianpupils).
The NGC finds 10% of the total numberof errors in the essays written by Slav students.For the deaf students, the NGC findings riseslightly, to 14%.
A reason for the higherpercentage could be that the deaf pupils makemany morphological mistakes, a feature theNGC is designed to detect.
For example, thesepupils typically use non-finite verb forms andwrong gender for nouns.Like the Chinese students, both theSlavs and the deaf pupils have a very highpercentage of ?non-grammatical?
errors, i.e.,lexical, idiomatic and pragmatic.
The non-grammatical errors of the Slav students amountto 60% of all errors, while the number for thedeaf pupils is 52%.However, there are also big differencesbetween the groups, see table (12) below.
Forexample, the foreign language students havefewer idiomatic and pragmatic errors than thedeaf pupils (20% of all errors versus 31%).
Thisaspect is even more striking when we look at thepragmatic errors only.
The Slav students haveonly 4% pragmatic errors (of all errors).
TheChinese students have a higher number; 9%.
Thedeaf students, however, have 22% pragmaticerrors.

They make no non-grammatical mistakes, few grammaticalmistakes4, and frequently split compoundsincorrectly.
16% of their errors were found bythe NGC ?
slightly higher than the number forthe other test groups, but much lower than theequivalent number of the SGC wich wasreported to be 35% (Birn 2000) in Swedishnewspaper texts.
Obviously, the reason for thelower number is that the essays by theNorwegian pupils are originally written by hand,and thus lack easily detectable cut-and-paste andour word-processing errors.
Our ongoingresearch will show us the results for the other"non-standard" language groups.The NGC gives surprisingly few ?falsealarms?
(the precision is 95%, as opposed to75% for the newspaper texts) in the texts bynon-standard language groups, due to the factthat their language is very simple, suiting theshallow analysis performed by the NGC.
Theprecision for the Norwegian control group isalso high: 87%.+	,With a larger-scale error analysis of authentictexts from the non-standard groups a lot of newknowledge could be found, which would make agood basis for improving the NGC.
Morespecifically, since morphological and syntacticfeatures are governed by sentence-internal rules,a rule-based grammar checker like the NGC4Apart from #$ errors (conjunction and inf.marker?notoriously difficult because the pronunciation is the same)should be able to account for violations of suchfeatures.In fact, we have done some testing forthis purpose, and developed rules for 14 newmorphological and syntactic error types5.
Onenew feature is the detection of compound wordserroneously written as two separate words (	 ?cancer studies?
instead of 	).The results are promising: The overall recall formorphological errors for our Chinese studentsnow increased from 38% to 53%.Detection of non-grammatical errors ismore difficult to improve.
Of course, with anadvanced lexicon containing e.g.
detailedsubcategorisation information, we might be ableto find some lexical errors, such as certainprepositions after certain verbs.
On the otherhand, a lexicon instead of context, sincesomething which looks like a subcategorisedcategory may in fact be something else.Idiomatic expressions are more of a problem,but given a large error corpus, it would bepossible to extract the most common error typesand look for these later.
Pragmatic errors arenotoriously difficult.
But even here, it would bepossible to use some system to alarm the userwhenever, for example, a singular count nounoccurs without a determiner or two verbs havedifferent tense in the same sentence.The Norwegian Grammar Checker was made fornative Norwegian speakers.
We have tested theNGC on texts written by "non-standard"language users (Slav and Chinese students ofNorwegian, and Norwegian native deaf pupils).It turned out that a high percentage, as much as85-90%, of their mistakes remained undetected.However, the picture is not quite as bleak as itmight seem, since the majority of the errors, 50-60%, were "non-grammatical", i.e.
lexical,idiomatic and pragmatic, errors which the NGCwas not designed to detect.Does this mean that a grammar checker is of nohelp for these groups?
We do not think so; 40-50% of the errors were grammatical, i.e.

Since theNGC is rule-based, it should be possible toaccount for many of these kinds of errors.Indeed, preliminary tests indicate that this is thecase.	Our thanks go to Wenche Vagle (the KALproject) for providing Norwegian essays, TheDepartment of Norwegian for Foreign Studentsat the UiO, for texts from foreign students,Elisabeth Svinndal and Sk?dalen skole for textsfrom deaf pupils, and to P?l Kristian Eriksen forvarious practical and linguistic help.-Arppe, A.
