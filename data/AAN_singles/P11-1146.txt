The method is indepen-dent of any particular relation inventory.
Itrelies on describing semantic relations usingprimitives and manipulating these primitivesaccording to an algebra.
The method wastested using a set of eight semantic relationsyielding 78 inference axioms which were eval-uated over PropBank.1 IntroductionCapturing the meaning of text is a long term goalwithin the NLP community.
Whereas during the lastdecade the field has seen syntactic parsers matureand achieve high performance, the progress in se-mantics has been more modest.
Previous researchhas mostly focused on relations between particularkind of arguments, e.g., semantic roles, noun com-pounds.
Notwithstanding their significance, theytarget a fairly narrow text semantics compared to thebroad semantics encoded in text.Consider the sentence in Figure 1.
Semantic rolelabelers exclusively detect the relations indicatedwith solid arrows, which correspond to the sentencesyntactic dependencies.
On top of those roles, thereare at least three more relations (discontinuous ar-rows) that encode semantics other than the verb-argument relations.In this paper, we venture beyond semantic rela-tion extraction from text and investigate techniquesto compose them.

This scheme, informally used previously forcombining HYPERNYM with other relations, has notbeen studied for arbitrary pairs of relations.For example, it seems adequate to state the fol-lowing: if x is PART-OF y and y is HYPERNYM of z,then x is PART-OF z.
An inference using this rule canbe obtained instantiating x, y and z with engine, carand convertible.
Going a step further, we considernonobvious inferences involving AGENT, PURPOSEand other semantic relations.The novelties of this paper are twofold.
First,an extended definition for semantic relations is pro-posed, including (1) semantic restrictions for theirdomains and ranges, and (2) semantic primitives.Second, an algorithm for obtaining inference ax-ioms is described.
Axioms take as their premiseschains of two relations and output a new relationlinking the ends of the chain.
This adds an extralayer of semantics on top of previously extracted re-1456Primitive Description Inv.

The conclusion of an axiom is identified us-ing an algebra for composing semantic primitives.We name this framework Composition of Seman-tic Relations (CSR).
The extended definition, set ofprimitives, algebra to compose primitives and CSRalgorithm are independent of any particular set ofrelations.
We first presented CSR and used it overPropBank in (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011).
In thispaper, we extend that work using a different set ofprimitives and relations.
Seventy eight inference ax-ioms are obtained and an empirical evaluation showsthat inferred relations have high accuracies.2 Semantic RelationsSemantic relations are underlying relations betweenconcepts.
In general, they are defined by a textualdefinition accompanied by a few examples.
For ex-ample, Chklovski and Pantel (2004) loosely defineENABLEMENT as a relation that holds between twoverbs V1 and V2 when the pair can be glossed asV1 is accomplished by V2 and gives two examples:assess::review and accomplish::complete.We find this widespread kind of definition weakand prone to confusion.
Following (Helbig, 2005),we propose an extended definition for semantic re-lations, including semantic restrictions for its argu-ments.
For example, AGENT(x, y) holds between ananimate concrete object x and a situation y.Moreover, we propose to characterize relations bysemantic primitives.
Primitives indicate whether aproperty holds between the arguments of a relation,e.g., the primitive temporal indicates if the first ar-gument must happen before the second.Besides having a better understanding of each re-lation, this extended definition allows us to identifypossible and not possible combinations of relations,as well as to automatically determine the conclusionof composing a possible combination.Formally, for a relation R(x, y), the extended def-initions specifies: (a) DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R)(i.e., semantic restrictions for x and y); and (b) PR(i.e., values for the primitives).
The inverse relationR?1 can be obtained by switching domain and range,and defining PR?1 as depicted in Table 1.2.1 Semantic PrimitivesSemantic primitives capture deep characteristics ofrelations.
They are independently determinable foreach relation and specify a property between an el-ement of the domain and an element of the range ofthe relation being described (Huhns and Stephens,1989).
Primitives are fundamental, they cannot beexplained using other primitives.For each primitive, each relation takes a valuefrom the set V = {+,?, 0}.
?+?
indicates that theprimitive holds, ???
that it does not hold, and ?0?that it does not apply.
Since a cause must precede itseffect, we have P temporalCAUSE = +.Primitives complement the definition of a relationand completely characterize it.
Coupled with do-main and range restrictions, primitives allow us toautomatically manipulate and reason over relations.14571:ComposableR2R1 ?

+ +Table 2: Algebra for composing semantic primitives.The set of primitives used in this paper (Table1) is heavily based on previous work in KnowledgeBases (Huhns and Stephens, 1989), but we consid-ered some new primitives.
The new primitives arejustified by the fact that we aim at composing rela-tions capturing the semantics from natural language.Whatever the set of relations, it will describe thecharacteristics of events (who / what / where / when/ why / how) and connections between them (e.g.,CAUSE, CORRELATION).
Time, space and volitionalso play an important role.

In or-der to instantiate an axiom, the premises must forma chain by having argument y in common.In general, for n relations there are(n2)pairs.

They have to be compatible.
A pair of relationsis compatible if it is possible, from a theoreticalpoint of view, to compose them.Formally, R1 and R2 are compatible iffRANGE(R1) ?

A third relation R3 must match as con-clusion, i.e., ?R3 such that DOMAIN(R3) ?DOMAIN(R1) 6= ?
and RANGE(R3) ?RANGE(R2) 6= ?.
Furthermore, PR3 mustbe consistent with PR1 ?

Consistent(PR1, PR2) is a simpleprocedure that compares the values assigned to eachprimitive; two values are consistent unless they havedifferent opposite values or any of them is ???
(i.e.,the composition is prohibited).3.3 An Example: Agent and PurposeWe present an example of applying the CSR algo-rithm by inspecting the potential axiom AGENT(x,y) ?
PURPOSE?1(y, z) ?
R3(x, z), where x is theagent of y, and action y has as its purpose z.
A state-ment instantiating the premises is [Mary]x [came]yto [talk]z about the issue.
Knowing AGENT(Mary,came) and PURPOSE?1(came, talk ), our goal is toidentify the links R3(Mary, talk ), if any.We use the relations as defined in Table 4.
First,we note that both AGENT and PURPOSE?1 are com-patible (Step 1).
Second, we must identify the pos-sible conclusions R3 that fit as conclusions (Step 2).Given PAGENT and PPURPOSE?1 , we obtain PAGENT ?PPURPOSE?1 using the algebra:PAGENT = {+,+,?,+, 0,?,?,+,?,0, 0}PPURPOSE?1 = {+,?,?,+,+,?,?,?,?,0,+}PAGENT ?
PPURPOSE?1 = {+,+,?,+,+,?,?,+,?,0,+}Out of all relations (Section 4), AGENT and IN-TENT?1 fit the conclusion match.
First, their do-mains and ranges are compatible with the composi-tion (Step 2a).
Second, both PAGENT and PINTENT?1are consistent with PAGENT ?
PPURPOSE?1 (Step 2b).Thus, we obtain the following axioms: AGENT(x, y)?
PURPOSE?1(y, z) ?
AGENT(x, z) and AGENT(x,y) ?
PURPOSE?1(y, z) ?
INTENT?1(x, z).Instantiating the axioms over [Mary]x [came]y to[talk]z about the issue yields AGENT(Mary, talk )and INTENT?1(Mary, talk ).

These two relations are valid butmost probably ignored by a role labeler since Maryis not an argument of talk.4 Case StudyIn this Section, we apply the CSR algorithm over aset of eight well-known relations.
It is out of thescope of this paper to explain in detail the semanticsof each relation or their detection.
Our goal is toobtain inference axioms and, taking for granted thatannotation is available, evaluate their accuracy.The only requirement for the CSR algorithm is todefine semantic relations using the extended defini-tion (Table 4).
To define domains and ranges, weuse the ontology in Section 4.2.
Values for the prim-itives are assigned manually.
The meaning of eachrelations is as follows:?
CAU(x, y) encodes a relation between two situa-tions, where the existence of y is due to the pre-vious existence of x, e.g., He [got]y a bad gradebecause he [didn?t submit]x the project.?
INT(x, y) links an animate concrete object and thesituations he wants to become true, e.g., [Mary]ywould like to [grow]x bonsais.?
PRP(x, y) holds between a concept y and its maingoal x.
Purposes can be defined for situations,e.g., [pruning]y allows new [growth]x; concreteobjects, e.g., the [garage]y is used for [storage]x ;or abstract objects, e.g., [language]y is used to[communicate]x .?
AGT(x, y) links a situation y and its intentionaldoer x, e.g., [Mary]x [went]y to Paris.
x is re-stricted to animate concrete objects.?
MNR(x, y) holds between the mode, way, style orfashion x in which a situation y happened.
x canbe a state, e.g., [walking]y [holding]x hands; ab-stract objects, e.g., [die]y [with pain]x; or qualities,e.g.
[fast]x [delivery]y .?
AT-L(x, y) defines the spatial context y of an ob-ject or situation x, e.g., He [went]x [to Cancun]y,[The car]x is [in the garage]y.?
AT-T(x, y) links an object or situation x, withits temporal information y, e.g., He [went]x[yesterday]y , [20th century]y [sculptures]x .?
SYN(x, y) can be defined between any two entitiesand holds when both arguments are semanticallyequivalent, e.g., SYN(dozen, twelve).4.1 Inference Axioms Automatically ObtainedAfter applying the CSR algorithm over the relationsin Table 4, we obtain 78 unique inference axioms(Table 5).
Each sub table must be indexed withthe first and second premises as row and column re-spectively.

Also, no relation is inferred betweentwo different effects of the same cause (a?1 ?

The location and temporal information of con-cept y is inherited by its cause, intention, pur-pose, agent and manner (sub table on the left, fand g columns).1460?
As expected, axioms involving SYNONYMY asone of their premises yield the other premise astheir conclusion (all sub tables).?
The AGENT of y is inherited by its causes, pur-poses and manners (d row, sub table on the right).In all examples below, AGT(x, y) holds, andwe infer AGT(x, z) after composing it with R2:(1) [He]x [went]y after [reading]z a good review,R2: CAU?1(y, z); (2) [They]x [went]y to [talk]zabout it, R2: PRP?1(y, z); and (3) [They]x [werewalking]y [holding]z hands, R2: MNR?1(y, z)An AGENT for a situation y is also inherited byits effects, and the situations that have y as theirmanner or purpose (d row, sub table on the left).?
A concept intends the effects of its intentionsand purposes (b?1 ?
a ?
b?1, c?1 ?
a ?b?1).
For example, [I]x printed the document to[read]y and [learn]z the contents; INT?1(I, read )?
CAU(read, learn) ?
INT?1(I, learn).It is important to note that domain and range re-strictions are not sufficient to identify inference ax-ioms; they only filter out pairs of not compatible re-lations.
The algebra to compose primitives is usedto detect prohibited combinations of relations basedon semantic grounds and identify the conclusion ofcomposing them.
Without primitives, the cells in Ta-ble 5 would be either empty (marking the pair as notcompatible) or would simply indicate that the pairhas compatible domain and range (without identify-ing the conclusion).Table 5 summarizes 136 unique pairs of premises(recall Ri ?
Rj = (Rj?1 ?
Ri?1)?1).
Domain andrange restrictions mark 39 (28.7%) as not compati-ble.
The algebra labels 12 pairs as prohibited (8.8%,[12.4% of the compatible pairs]) and is unable tofind a conclusion 14 times (10.3%, [14.4%]).
Fi-nally, conclusions are found for 71 pairs (52.2%,[73.2%]).
Since more than one conclusion might bedetected for the same pair of premises, 78 inferenceaxioms are ultimately identified.4.2 OntologyIn order to define domains and ranges, we use a sim-plified version of the ontology presented in (Helbig,2005).
We find enough to contemplate only sevenbase classes: ev, st, co, aco, ao, loc and tmp.
Entities(ent) refer to any concept and are divided into situa-tions (si), objects (o) and descriptors (des).?
Situations are anything that happens at a time andplace and are divided into events (ev) and states(st).
Events imply a change in the status of otherentities (e.g., grow, conference); states do not(e.g., be standing, account for 10%).?
Objects can be either concrete (co, palpable, tan-gible, e.g., table, keyboard) or abstract (ao, intan-gible, product of human reasoning, e.g., disease,weight).
Concrete objects can be further classi-fied as animate (aco) if they have life, vigor orspirit (e.g.
John, cat).?
Descriptors state properties about the local (loc,e.g., by the table, in the box) or temporal (tmp,e.g., yesterday, last month) context of an entity.This simplified ontology does not aim at definingdomains and ranges for any relation set; it is a sim-plification to fit the eight relations we work with.5 EvaluationAn evaluation was performed to estimate the valid-ity of the 78 axioms.
Because the number of axiomsis large we have focused on a subset of them (Table6).
The 31 axioms having SYN as premise are intu-itively correct: since synonymous concepts are in-terchangeable, given veracious annotation they per-form valid inferences.We use PropBank annotation (Palmer et al, 2005)to instantiate the premises of each axiom.
First,all instantiations of axiom PRP ?
MNR?1 ?
MNR?1were manually checked.
This axiom yields 237 newMANNER, 189 of which are valid (Accuracy 0.80).Second, we evaluated axioms 1?7 (Table 6).Since PropBank is a large corpus, we restricted thisphase to the first 1,000 sentences in which there is aninstantiation of any axiom.
These sentences contain1,412 instantiations and are found in the first 31,450sentences of PropBank.Table 6 depicts the total number of instantiationsfor each axiom and its accuracy (columns 3 and 4).Accuracies range from 0.40 to 0.90, showing that theplausibility of an axiom depends on the axiom.
Theaverage accuracy for axioms involving CAU is 0.54and for axioms involving PRP is 0.87.Axiom CAU ?

MNR?1,only yields 71 new MNR, and yet it is adding 3.21%in relative terms with an accuracy of 0.82.Overall, applying the seven axioms adds 923 re-lations on top of the ones already present (2.84% inrelative terms) with an accuracy of 0.77.
Figure 2shows examples of inferences using axioms 1?3.5.1 Error AnalysisBecause of the low accuracy of axiom 1, an erroranalysis was performed.
We found that unlike otheraxioms, this axiom often yield a relation type thatis already present in the semantic representation.Specifically, it often yields R(x, z) when R(x?, z) isalready known.
We use the following heuristic inorder to improve accuracy: do not instantiate an ax-iom R1(x, y) ?
R2(y, z) ?
R3(x, z) if a relation of theform R3(x?, z) is already known.This simple heuristic has increased the accuracyof the inferences at the cost of lowering their pro-ductivity.
The last three columns in Table 6 showresults when using the heuristic.6 Comparison with Previous WorkThere have been many proposals to detect seman-tic relations from text without composition.
Re-searches have targeted particular relations (e.g.,CAUSE (Chang and Choi, 2006; Bethard and Mar-tin, 2008)), relations within noun phrases (Nulty,2007), named entities (Hirano et al, 2007) or clauses(Szpakowicz et al, 1995).
Competitions include(Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005;Girju et al, 2007; Hendrickx et al, 2009).Two recent efforts (Ruppenhofer et al, 2009; Ger-ber and Chai, 2010) are similar to CSR in their goal(i.e., extract meaning ignored by current semanticparsers), but completely differ in their means.
Theirmerit relies on annotating and extracting semanticconnections not originally contemplated (e.g., be-tween concepts from two different sentences) us-ing an already known and fixed relation set.
UnlikeCSR, they are dependent on the relation inventory,require annotation and do not reason or manipulaterelations.
In contrast to all the above references andthe state of the art, the proposed framework obtainsaxioms that take as input semantic relations pro-1462duced by others and output more relations: it addsan extra layer of semantics previously ignored.Previous research has exploited the idea of usingsemantic primitives to define and classify seman-tic relations under the names of relation elements,deep structure, aspects and primitives.
The first at-tempt on describing semantic relations using prim-itives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987);they differentiate 31 relations using 30 relation el-ements clustered into five groups (intensional force,dimension, agreement, propositional and part-wholeinclusion).
Winston et al (1987) introduce 3 rela-tion elements (functional, homeomerous and sepa-rable) to distinguish six subtypes of PART-WHOLE.Cohen and Losielle (1988) use the notion of deepstructure in contrast to the surface relation and uti-lizes two aspects (hierarchical and temporal).
Huhnsand Stephens (1989) consider a set of 10 primitives.In theoretical linguistics, Wierzbicka (1996) in-troduced the notion of semantic primes to performlinguistic analysis.
Dowty (2006) studies composi-tionality and identifies entailments associated withcertain predicates and arguments (Dowty, 2001).There has not been much work on composingrelations in the field of computational linguistics.The term compositional semantics is used in con-junction with the principle of compositionality, i.e.,the meaning of a complex expression is determinedfrom the meanings of its parts, and the way in whichthose parts are combined.
These approaches areusually formal and use a potentially infinite set ofpredicates to represent semantics.
Ge and Mooney(2009) extracts semantic representations using syn-tactic structures while Copestake et al (2001) devel-ops algebras for semantic construction within gram-mars.
Logic approaches include (Lakoff, 1970;Sa?nchez Valencia, 1991; MacCartney and Manning,2009).
Composition of Semantic Relations is com-plimentary to Compositional Semantics.Previous research has manually extracted plau-sible inference axioms for WordNet relations(Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1998) and transformedchains of relations into theoretical axioms (Helbig,2005).
The CSR algorithm proposed here automati-cally obtains inference axioms.Composing relations has been proposed beforewithin knowledge bases.
Cohen and Losielle (1988)combines a set of nine fairly specific relations (e.g.,FOCUS-OF, PRODUCT-OF, SETTING-OF).
The keyto determine plausibility is the transitivity charac-teristic of the aspects: two relations shall not com-bine if they have contradictory values for any aspect.The first algebra to compose semantic primitiveswas proposed by Huhns and Stephens (1989).
Theirrelations are not linguistically motivated and ten ofthem map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g.
PIECE-OF, SUBREGION-OF).
Unlike (Cohen and Losielle,1988; Huhns and Stephens, 1989), we use typicalrelations that encode the semantics of natural lan-guage, propose a method to automatically obtain theinverse of a relation and empirically test the validityof the axioms obtained.7 ConclusionsGoing beyond current research, in this paper weinvestigate the composition of semantic relations.The proposed CSR algorithm obtains inference ax-ioms that take as their input semantic relations andoutput a relation previously ignored.
Regardless ofthe set of relations and annotation scheme, an ad-ditional layer of semantics is created on top of thealready existing relations.An extended definition for semantic relations isproposed, including restrictions on their domainsand ranges as well as values for semantic primitives.Primitives indicate if a certain property holds be-tween the arguments of a relation.
An algebra forcomposing semantic primitives is defined, allowingto automatically determine the primitives values forthe composition of any two relations.The CSR algorithm makes use of the extendeddefinition and algebra to discover inference axiomsin an unsupervised manner.
Its usefulness is shownusing a set of eight common relations, obtaining 78axioms.
Empirical evaluation shows the axioms add2.32% of relations in relative terms with an overallaccuracy of 0.88, more than what state-of-the-art se-mantic parsers achieve.The framework presented is completely indepen-dent of any particular set of relations.
Even thoughdifferent sets may call for different ontologies andprimitives, we believe the model is generally appli-cable; the only requirement is to use the extendeddefinition.
This is a novel way of retrieving seman-tic relations in the field of computational linguistics.1463ReferencesSteven Bethard and James H. Martin.
