Abney (1988), Berwick &Weinberg (1984), Clark (1987), Fong (1990),Gibson (1987), Johnson (1988), Kashket (1988),Pritchett (1987, 1988, 1990, in press,forthcoming), Stabler (1989), among others).Fundamental to principle-based as opposed torule-based models of parsing is the hypothesisthat the Parser itself adheres to a version of theProjection Principle which maintains thateach level of syntactic representation is aprojection of the lexical properties of heads.With respect o parsing, the PP implies that anode emmet be projected before the occurrence ofits head since the relevant features whichdetermine its categorical identity and license itsown and its arguments'  attachment aretheretofore undetermined.
This paper describesan ongoing project in the implementation f anobject-oriented (Smalltalk-80 TM) Government andBinding parser which adheres to Ihe strongcompetence hypothesis that principles ofUniversal Grammar are emp!oyed irectly inparsing.
Specifically, the parse operates byprojecting phrasal structure as determined by thelexical properties of heads and licensing localattachments which maximally satisfy on-lineprinciples of Universal Grammar at every pointduring a parse.
Though this model wasoriginally motivated with regard to itspsychological plausibility, in this paper wetbcus primarily on issues of implementation (seePritchett: op.
cir.
for a more detailed iscussionof the psycho!inguistic issues).In the implemented parser, the followingnew Ob ject  subclasses are defined:ObjectPrincipleBasedParserLexiconLexicalItemNodeEmptyNodeFullNodeDoubleBarNodeSingleBarNodeZeroBarNodeChainLicensingRelationThetaRoleAs signmentCaseAssignmentSpecHe adAgreementXPSe lectionAn instance of PrincipleBasedParser(henceforth simply the parse,') itself7 acts as thebuffer for tree structures.
The parse of a stringsucceeds if at the end of input, there is exactlyone tree in the parser and all grammaticalprinciples are satisfied for every Node in thattree.The syntactic structures actually created andmanipulated by the parser are subinstances of theclass Node.
Nodes accord with a binary-branching version of X' Theory and each Nodeexists as an element of a maximal projection:\[xP \[vP \] \[x' \[X\] \[zP \]\]\].
Phrase Structureconstraints on the linear order of Nodes isspecified in the pool variable, HeadParameter; inthis note we assume the English configuration.The speci f ier  and complement positionsthemselves are either fully specified maximalprojections or instances of the special classEmptyNode.
Nodes respond in the expectedfashion to a range of messages concerningeonf igurat ional  structure, such as c -commands :, m-commands ::, governs:,mother, sister, etc.Each Node may be associated (coindexed)wittl other Nodes via an instance of the classcha in ,  a subclass of Sor ted  Co l lec t ion ,where Node ct precedes Node 13 in an instanceof Cha in  iff a c-commands 13.
Given thisdefinition, two Nodes may cooccur within thesame Cha in  only if they are contained in thesame tree structure.
Every Node has anassociated Chain,  though in the default case aNode is the Cha in '  s singleton member.
Fora Node to be global ly licit, all relevantgrammatical principles must be satisfied withrespect to a its Chain.Subinstances of tt~e abstract classLicensingRelation represent he actualprinciples of Grammar which license Nodes,such as the 0-criterion and Case Theory.
EachNode keeps track of all licensing relations inwhich it participates via the instance variableslicenserRelationslicenseeRelations.As an illustration of the model as discussedso far, consider how a simple sentence,Vampires were seen, is processed.This sentence is fed to the processor one PF-word at a time by the procedure:I parser  \]parser<- PrincipleBasedParsernewEnglishParser ?parser newWord.
'vampires 'parser newWord: 'wex"e 'parser newWord: 'seen'%parser outputFirst a parser with an English lexicon andEnglish parameter  settings; (e.g.
the1 437HeadParameter)  is created by sendingPrincipleBasedParser the messagenewEng l i shParser .
Next, the string'vampires' is sent to the parser with the messagenewWord:, which operates as follows:newWord: aWord\[ lexical Item maximalProject ion ImaximalPr o j e c tion<--I exiconproject: aWord.self addLast: maximalProjection.self changedThe lexicon is queried and returns a maximalproject ion in response to the messageproject : ' vampires'.
This maximalProjection: \[.xv \[e\] [~, \[y vampires\] \[e\]\]\] is addedto the parser, where the e indicates instances ofthe class EmptyNode, which may ultimatelybe filled by or eoindexed with other Nodes.Next, and crucial to the on-line application ofgrammatical principles, the changed messageis sent, indicating that the parser's contents havealtered and signaling that the reapplication ofgrammatical principles is relevant.
Wheneverthe parser eceives the message changed,  it isautomatically sent the message update :  bythe Smalltalk-80 TM system, which is defined asfollows:update: dummyself attachLastTwoTrees.self expandLastTree.self bui ldChains InLastTreeThe most important message in this method isattachLastTwoTrees wherein the 0-criterion and Case Theory (among others)actively determine attachments.
Furthermore, ifany of the three messages ent by update  :itself makes changes to the parser's contents, ittoo will in turn send changed messages to theparser, again tr iggering the sending ofupdate  :.
In tlais way, the parser manipulatesits contents continually until a local steady stateis reached with all grammatical principlesmaximally satisfied.
Hence, thischanged/update :  message sequence isfundamental to the parser's operation as it is inthis fashion that grammatical principles arerepresented as on-line in the system.Returning to the example, none of themessages within update has any effect when theparser comains only the NP vmnpires, and theparser eaches a steady state with no licenseravailable and the NP unavoidably left locallyrole!ess.
No higher structure, including IP, isprojected as relevant heads have not beenencounterS.Next, the word 'were' is sent to the parser,and its maximal projection, an I_P, added: \[yp \[e\]\[~, \[~ vampires\] tell\], tip \[e\] [i, \[i were \[e\]\]\].
Asa result, a changed message is sent, and theupdate  : message's method is executed.
Thistime, the message attachLastTwoTreeswill have an effect.
This method examines thelast two trees in the parser and attempts allpossible attachments of one into positions in theother.
The method then chooses the attachmentwhich is licensed to the highest degree.
Anattachment is defined as licensed to degree nif bymaking the attachment, n different licensingrelations will be newly discharged.
(SeePritchett cited above for psycholinguisticjustification of this selection procedure as wellas some alternative approaches to the notion'maximal ly  l icensed' . )
Given adjacencyrequirements, two attachments are considered Inthis example: the attachment of the IP into thecomplement ofNP and the attachment of the NPinto the specifier of IE Only the second resultsin the discharge of a licensing relation, namelythe case assigned by I under government.
Hence,this attachment is chosen, so that the parser nowcontains only one element: \[Iv \[vampires\] it' \[~were\] \[e\]\]\].
The requirements of Case Theory aresatisfied to the maximum degree possible in thelocal string- both with respect o the target NPwhich requires these features and the head whichmust discharge them.Next the method expandLastTree  issent.
In this case, the method causes the IP toexpand into a CE As a result, the contents ofthe parser becomes: \[cv \[e\] [c' \[c \] tip \[vampires\]it' \[i were\] tel\]I\]\].
The last message in themethod for update :,bui ldChainsInLastTree is sent but hasno effect.
Since the first two messages sent inupdate  : caused changes to the contents of theparser, they both send changed messages, withthe result that update  : is executed again.However,  none of the three messages inupdate  : has any effect this time around asthere is a single tree in the parser, and a localsteady state has been reached, with all structurelicensed to the maximum degree possible withrespect to UG principles.Finally, the word seen is sent to the parser.Seen is identified as a passive participle which,as a lexical property, assigns an internal 0-rolebut no Case.
In the VP which is projected, theV acts as the licenser in a licensing relation,namely an instance of ThetaRoleAssignmentunder government.
Again, since the parser'scontents have changed, update  : is sent,invoking a t tachLastTwoTrees  forcingtheVP attachment asa complement of INt,L: \[cp tel\[c' \[c \] tip \[vampires\] it' \[t were\] \[\[vP \[e\] iv' \[vseen\] \[e\]\]\]\]\]\]\].
(This is carried out by means ofan instance of XPSelection- a subclass ofLicensingRelation relevant o functional heads.
)The message xpandLastTree is sent buthas no effect.
Next,  the messagebu i ldCha ins InLastTree  is sent.
Themethod associated with this message attempts toassociate Nodes and EmptyNodes (throughCha in  building) in order to more fully satisfyCase Thee D' and the 0-criterion.
In this examplethe empty complement of VP is added to theCha in  associated with the NP vampires and theV's 0-role assigned to this empty position.
As a438 2result, the Cha in  possesses both a 0-role andCase since its head (the NP) is in a Caseposition and its tail (the empty node) in 0-position.
The contents of the parser are now:\[cP \[e\] [c' \[c \] \[iP \[NP vampires\]l \[l' \[I were\] \[\[ve\[e\] Iv' \[v seen\] \[e\]l\]\]\]\]\]\].
Inputterminates andthe message output  is sent to the parser,which checks that all mandatory licensingrelations have been fulfilled and returns the finalstructure.At this point, we will briefly discuss howthe head-driven principle-based model herepredicts certain psycholinguistic facts.
Thisdiscussion will be schematic and the reader isrefen'ed to Pritchett (op.
cit.).
Consider forexample, well-known garden-path effects of thesort found in an example like, After John drankthe water evaporated Informally, the problemfor the human parser in such examples is thatthe post verbal NP is prematurely construed asthe complement of the verb, which causesdifficulty when it must be reinterpreted as asubject.
In terms of our implementation, oncethe parser has been sent the words up throughwater, it contains the following tree: \[cP \[e\] \[c'\[c after\] ~1, \[NP John\] \[i' \[I el\] \[\[ve \[e\] Iv' \[vdrank:t\] \[nr the water\]\]\]\]\]\]\].
Subsequently, theword evaporated is sent, and the projected VPadded to the parser, however there is no licensingposition into which it can attach.
This remainstrue when the VP subsequently expands to IPand CP: \[CP \[e\] [C' \[C\] lIP \[e\] \[I' \[I e\] \[\[VP \[eliIv' \[vevaporatedl\] \[e\]\]\]\]\]\]\].
The initialmisanalysis of the NP the water results from theparser's premature construal of a global subjectas a local object in order to satisfy Case and 0-theory, which results in global failure.
Thereason that reanalysis is not possible ininstances of this sort is due to the hypothesislicensed positions are indelible and is discussedin detail in Pritehett (op.
cit.).
What is crucialis that a principle-based parser of this sort makesthe initial parsing error as a result of itsfundamental strategy to maximally satisfygrammatical principles locally at every pointduring the parse.The architecture of the parser also arguablyprovides a processing, as opposed to agrammatical, account of effects deriving fromHuang's (1982) Constraint on ExtractionDomains which prohibits movement fromwithin posit ions which are not properlygoverned.
For example, it proscribes examplessuch as, *Who i do pictures of e i bother John.To give just one example, according to ourparsing-theoretic a count, extraction from withinsubjects is impossible since there is simply nolocal option of forming the requisite cha in  atthe time the subject constituent is being parsed,given the fact that the parser is strictly headdriven.
Recall that a sentence (IP) is notprojected until either an inflectional element or averb possessing inflectional features isprocessed.
Before a category is projected, it isimpossible to license its specifier, the subject.Consequently, in the previous example, after theword of is processed, the parser contains thefollowing two unintegrated Nodes: Ice \[NPwho\] \[c' \[c do\] \[e\]\]\], and \[yp \[el \[s'\[s pictures\]\[pp \[p of\] \[e\]\]\]\]\].
These two Nodes cannot belocally integrated before the projection of IP andhence the requisite Cha in  cannot be formedbetween the wh-word in SPEC-CP into the NPpictures of as the two phrases are not locallyconstituents of the same parse tree.
in otherwords, the NP is not locally a subject at thatpoint during the parse but i,; rather unattached.See Pritchett (to appear) for details.
Thus ourimplementation begins to provide an existenceproof that a parser driven by the ProjectionPrinciple and the on.-line application of globalgrammatical principles is both psychologicallyand implementationally realistic.References:Abney, Steven.
