The fr-LN accounts for lexical knowledge as a lexical network structured byparadigmatic and syntagmatic relations holding between lexical units.
This paper describes howmorphological knowledge is presently being introduced into the fr-LN through the implemen-tation and lexicographic exploitation of a dynamic morphological model.
Section 1 presentstheoretical and practical justifications for the approach which we believe allows for a cogni-tively sound description of morphological data within semantically-oriented lexical databases.Section 2 gives an overview of the structure of the dynamic morphological model, which isconstructed through two complementary processes: a Morphological Process?section 3?and aLexicographic Process?section 4.1 IntroductionWe present a morphological model implemented in order to feed the French Lexical Network database?hereafter fr-LN?, presently under development at the ATILF CNRS lab.
The fr-LN belongs to the broadfamily of lexical resources designed as networks of lexical units (Fellbaum, 1998; Baker et al., 2003;Ruppenhofer et al., 2010; Spohr, 2012).
Its design, content and mode of construction has already beendocumented in various publications (Lux-Pogodalla and Polgu?re, 2011; Gader et al., 2012; Polgu?re,2014; Polgu?re, to appear) and we strictly focus here on its newly developed morphological component.The morphological description of French lexemes discussed below possesses two main characteristics:1. it is dynamically created from a full-fledged grammatical model of French inflectional morphology;2. it is meant to be used in the context of a lexicographic project where morphological tables are indi-vidually associated to senses of (polysemic) vocables, thus accounting for potential morphologicaldiscrepancies between senses within a given vocable.We believe that our approach allows for a cognitively sound implementation of morphology in lexicaldatabases that are primarily oriented towards the description of senses (rather than forms).
Indeed, wedo not simply inject lists of lexical forms into the fr-LN database but describe morphological knowledge bymeans of a ?true?
model of French inflectional morphology.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/1541.1 Interconnection between lexical and morphological modelsThere are at least two main characteristics that a cognitively sound lexical model of a given language hasto possess.?
First and foremost, it must account for the Speaker?s knowledge of lexical rules (a lexical unit andall its properties being considered here as being a cluster of lexical rules).?
Second, it must be structured in a way that makes it possible to support the modeling of (i) ?natural?processes of lexical knowledge evolution?acquisition, consolidation, relativization, loss of lexicalknowledge?and (ii) linguistic processes of speech, understanding, paraphrase, translation, wordassociation (Dunbar, 2012), etc.Lexical knowledge, however, is intricately related to grammatical knowledge, to the point that it is notnecessarily possible to radically separate lexical information from grammatical information in a cognitivelexicon.
This is particularly true for language morphology, that can be said to belong simultaneously toboth the lexical and grammatical modules of natural languages.
Consequently, a lexical model thataims at cognitive relevance has to take the morphological bull by the horns and handle morphologicalproperties and behavior of lexical units by modeling actual morphological knowledge.Not all lexical resources link a lexical unit to its forms and morphology is often ?externalized,?
usingseparate dedicated resources (see section 1.2 below).
However, for a language that is rather rich in termsof inflectional morphology, such as French, it is particularly interesting to embed in lexical resourcesan explicit morphological model.
The purpose of such model is to allow lexicographers to account forinflected forms of lexical units by associating each individual unit (= sense) to inflectional classes anddynamically obtain in the process morphological tables of all corresponding lexical forms.Before we proceed, let us enumerate the basic terminology that will be used throughout the paper.?
Lexical units are of two kinds: (i) lexemes?CHEVAL I.1a ?horse?
?
CHEVAL I.1b ?horse riding?
?are monolexemic lexical units; (ii) idioms?CULOTTE DE CHEVAL ?saddlebags?
?are syntagmaticlexical units.?
Vocables?CHEVAL?are (potentially) polysemic words.
They are modeled in the fr-LN as sets oflexical units connected by a relation of copolysemy.?
Wordforms are linguistic signs expressing lexemes?singular cheval I.1a and plural chevaux I.1a arethe two wordforms for the CHEVAL I.1a lexeme.
Because wordforms are linguistic signs, each in-dividual wordform has to be described as a <signified, signifier, restricted combinatorics> triplet(Mel?
?cuk, 2012, Chapter 1).1.2 Current approaches to morphology in sense-oriented lexical databasesIn this section, we briefly summarize the treatment of morphological information in major sense-orientedlexical databases and explain why we decided to elaborate an approach of our own.Our initial constraints were that we wanted to truly handle forms related to lexemes with respect togeneral rules of inflectional morphology.
Additionally, we wanted to model in an elegant way phenomenasuch as spelling variation (cuill?re ?spoon?
?
cuiller), euphony (j?aime ?I love?
?
aim?-je), alternativeinflected forms (je m?assois ?
je m?assieds) or defectiveness (je fris du lard ?I fry bacon?, but there is nocorresponding 1stperson plural; one has to say nous faisons frire du lard lit.
?We make bacon fry?
).To our knowledge, no current general purpose lexical database?for French or other languages?currently meet these requirements.
WordNet, for instance, only stores base forms of lexemes and has noembedded morphological model of English.
An external lemmatizer, Morphy,1is used to access lexicalsenses via inflected forms.
The situation is different in FrameNet.
As indicated in (Ruppenhofer etal., 2010, p. 93?94), lemmas are stored in the Lexical Database component of FrameNet, together withcorresponding wordforms.
However, no grammatical model of inflection is embedded in the databaseand made available for lexicographic purposes.1https://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/morphy.7WN.html1552 Dynamic approach to morphological descriptionThis section is devoted to the presentation of the morphological model embedded in the fr-LN.
We pro-ceed in two steps.
Firstly (section 2.1), we detail the limitations of existing morphological databases forFrench, which explain why we decided to not ?inject?
their content in the fr-LN.
Secondly (section 2.2),we present the general design of our morphological model and detail its dynamic nature.2.1 Limitations of existing morphological resources for FrenchIn order to model ?morphological knowledge?
within a lexical database, one can either make use of analready existing morphological ressource (that will be connected to or embedded into the database), ordevelop a specific, tailor-made morphological database module?see (Issac, 2010) for a detailed discus-sion.
There exist indeed several morphological resources for French that, in principle, could have beenused as embedded morphological modules in the fr-LN.
We will explain why limitations found in theseresources have led us to choose the second option and design our own morphological model.We have mainly examined six morphological resources for French, all developed during the past tenyears: Manulex, Morphalou, Lexique 3, Lefff, Flexique and Morfetik.2Here is a brief recap of theobservations we have made, based on our specific needs and expectations.
For lack of space, we cannotmake a detailed presentation of these resources and our evaluation will by necessity be rather sketchy.Manulex was designed for psycholinguistic research (L?t?
et al., 2004).
It contains 48,886 Frenchwordforms.
The list of wordforms results from a ?grade-based word frequency list extracted from acorpus of first to fifth grade readers used in French elementary schools?
(L?t?
et al., 2004, p. 159).Manulex has therefore a limited coverage, when compared to other existing resources that target the bulkof the French lexicon and can store up to 500,000 forms.But coverage is not the only issue.
The quality of data can vary greatly from database to database.
InMorphalou (Romary et al., 2004), for instance, one can find a lot of miscategorizations and misspellings.Reusing Morphalou?s data would thus raise many maintenance issues.While having a larger coverage than Manulex and data of better quality than Morphalou, Lexique 3(New, 2006) poses several problems of its own.
First, inflectional paradigms are not complete, becauseLexique 3?s wordlist was extracted from the Frantext corpus (Mont?mont, 2008), that contains only partof the lexicon of contemporary French.
Second, pairs like chat ?cat?
?
chatte ?female cat?
have beenencoded as one entry, which contradicts our theoretical and descriptive choices.
Following (Mel?
?cuk,2000; Delaite and Polgu?re, 2013), we consider that no inflectional mechanism is involved here.
Thereare two distinct CHAT ?
CHATTE nominal lexemes in French; the feminine is morphologically derived(i.e.
produced by morphological derivation) from the masculine and has to be accounted for separately.Both aspects?incompleteness and inapropriate descriptive postulates such as in the case of Nmasc?Nfempairs?disqualified Lexique 3 in our quest for an already-existing resource.Flexique (Bonami et al., 2013) is derived from Lexique 3, but the problems we just mentioned aresolved: paradigms are now complete and pairs like CHAT ?
CHATTE have been encoded as two sepa-rate entries.
However, Flexique?just as the two remaining resources Lefff3(Sagot, 2010) and Morfetik(Mathieu-Colas, 2009)?lacks alternative forms for inflections4or orthographic variants, as reported bythe authors themselves.Last but not least, all resources cited above associate a morphological description to a lexical entry,not to a specific sense.
However, not all senses of a given polysemic vocable necessarily possess thesame morphological behavior, and this is valid for most of natural languages.
For instance, the sense?flag or other symbolic object?
of the COLOR vocable is plural only (to raise the colors).
In other words:2These resources are all available for research.
The dictionaries of the Antidote suite incorporate a powerful morphologicalmodel for French (Antidote, 2014).
However, Antidote is a commercial product; we cannot examine its internal design and itsmorphological model is of course not available for embedding in a lexical database such as fr-LN, whose linguistic content willbe freely available.3Lexique des Formes Fl?chies du Fran?ais.4For instance, these resources do not indicate that Fr.
AIL ?garlic?
has two alternative plural forms ails ?
aulx (section 4.1below) or that S?ASSEOIR ?to sit?
has two alternative forms for most of its inflections?je m?assoie ?
je m?assieds, tu t?assois?
tu t?assieds, il s?assoit ?
il s?assied.
.
.156A morphological model encapsulated in a lexical database should describe actual wordforms:linguistic signs made up of a signified, a signifier and combinatorial properties.
Signifiersshould not remain disconnected from the signified they express.In this respect, and to our knowledge, there exists no sense-based morphological model available forFrench prior to our work.
This left us with no choice but to design a model of our own, that would bespecially designed to accompany our lexicographic project and be better suited for applications such asword sense identification backed by lexical knowledge (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998).2.2 General design of the fr-LN dynamic morphological modelThe core of our morphological model is a set of Morphological Templates that define corresponding in-flection classes as Prototypical Tables of inflection.
These latter tables are named after a lexeme thatprototypically represents the corresponding morphological paradigm: Prototypical Table of nouns of theCHAT ?cat?
family, of verbs of the DANSER ?dance?
family, etc.
The association of a Prototypical Table toa given lexeme automatically generates one or more Lexeme Table(s), i.e.
tables that contain the descrip-tion of all wordforms expressing this lexeme.
Wordforms themselves are defined as relations holdingbetween three database elements: (i) a given Lexeme Table, (ii) a set of grammatical features (mainly,grammemes) associated to the wordform and (iii) a given signifier.The integration of morphological knowledge into the fr-LN database is performed through two com-plementary processes, as visualized in Figure 1:1. a Morphological Process?construction of Morphological Templates from which Prototypical Tablesare generated;2. a Lexicographic Process?creation of Lexeme?Prototypical Table(s) associations, from which Lex-eme Tables are automatically derived.Figure 1: The fr-LN dynamic morphological model157Morphological Templates and Prototypical Tables are the core modules of our dynamic morpholog-ical model.
In section 3 below, we describe the Morphological Process that leads to the creation ofMorphological and Prototypical Tables.
We then proceed, in section 4, with the Lexicographic Processthat leads to the generation of individual Lexeme Tables.
In both sections, we use examples to illustratethe descriptive power and flexibility of the approach in the context of our lexicographic enterprise.3 Morphological Process?Morphological Templates and Prototypical TablesThe construction of the morphological model?Morphological and Lexicographic Processes?is per-formed with the Dicet editor (Gader et al., 2012), the same lexicographic editor used to built the fr-LNlexical graph through weaving of lexical relations.
Illustrative figures in this section and the next one arescreen dumps of access to the morphological model by means of Dicet.3.1 Morphological TemplatesThe role of Morphological Templates is to establish parameter and variable slots that are common to setsof related Prototypical Tables.
For instance, the Adjectifs ?Adjectives?
template, shown in Figure 2,is used to generate all adjectival Prototypical Tables.Figure 2: The Adjectifs Morphological TemplateFigure 2 indicates that all Prototypical Tables that are created from the Adjectifs template will havethe same set of columns, defined in the table called Variables: gender, number, truncation performedon the string of characters that corresponds to the stem, addition to it, suffixation and variation(s).More generally, variables correspond to either:?
grammemes expressed by the wordforms;?
formal adjustments to be performed on the stem (truncation from/addition to the stem, suffixation);?
possible variations of given wordforms in the table.Each wordform is related to a particular set of variables.
For example, the wordform actives?whichmeans ?active?
?
feminine ?
plural5and whose stem is actif?is associated to the following set of vari-5The ?
operator represents the linguistic union of (components of) two linguistic signs (Mel?
?cuk, 2012, Chapter 1).158able instanciations: Genre=feminine, Nombre=plural, Tronquer=1, Ajouter=-v-, Suffixe=-es,Variation(s)=?.The Parameters table specifies the characteristics that are shared by all tables of a given template.For instance, all adjectival tables contain a Base ?stem?
field and a Variation(s) field.
This meansthat an adjectival table will force the lexicographer to declare the stem used to generate all the wordformsof the adjective and will allow her to declare possible variants for all wordforms of the table, which willcondition the generation of more than one Lexeme Table.Let us illustrate this with the lexeme AB?M?
?damaged?.
Declaring the morphology of this lexeme willtrigger the generation of two morphological tables: one for the (default) ?traditional?
spelling (1.)
andone for the ?rectified?
spelling (2.).61.
AB?M?
{ab?m?
(masc, sing), ab?m?s(masc, plur), ab?m?e(fem, sing), ab?m?es(fem, plur)};2.
AB?M?
{abim?
(masc, sing), abim?s(masc, plur), abim?e(fem, sing), abim?es(fem, plur)}Variation(s)=rectified spelling.Because of the rather rich morphology of French verbs, verbal templates require more parametersand variables than nominal or adjectival ones.
For instance, verbal templates require two additionalparameters in order to deal with (i) choice of auxiliary for compound tenses and (ii) possible use of theSE reflexive pronoun if the verb is pronominal (e.g.
SE SUICIDER ?to commit suicide?
)?see section 4.3.Notice that the rationale behind the use of Morphological Templates is the need to design a genericapproach that will allow us to work on typologically unrelated languages?cf.
final remarks in section 5.It is at the level of Morphological Templates that general principles of word construction are encoded,for each individual language.3.2 Prototypical TablesAs mentioned earlier, Prototypical Tables are generated from Morphological Templates: they featureactualizations of all characteristics (parameters and variables) defined in their source template.
In otherwords, Prototypical Tables represent morphological classes.
At the time of writing, 15 PrototypicalTables have been created using the Noms ?Nouns?
template, 34 using Adjectifs and almost a hundredPrototypical Tables have been created to account for French verbal morphology.Figure 3 illustrates the approach with the petit ?small?
Prototypical Table.
This table instantiatesthe Adjectifs Morphological Template with Base=petit and Variation(s)=?
as parameters.Figure 3: The petit ?small?
Prototypical Table6The French language council of France?Conseil de la langue fran?aise?has officially introduced a new spelling systemin 1990 (Conseil sup?rieur de la langue fran?aise, 1990), which concerns around 5,000 words and whose usage has beendeclared to be facultative.
Some 25 years later, both the traditional and rectified systems are still cohabiting, even in officialtexts and at school, which pretty much disqualifies the spelling reform as being a stunning success.
Based on current trends (orlack thereof), the approach of the fr-LN database is to maintain the two systems, using the traditional spelling as default one.159In Figure 3, the Rules table displays the result of the creation of the Prototypical Table, whereeach line corresponds to a given dynamically created wordform of PETIT.
In each individual ?rule?(i.e.
grammatical characterization of the corresponding wordform) the gender and number features areinstantiated with one grammeme of the pairs masculine ?
feminine and singular ?
plural, respectively.The rule corresponding to the wordform that functions as lexicographic name for the lexeme is checkedon the left-hand side.
(The lexicographic name of a lexeme is the default form that will be used to namethis lexeme in dictionary wordlists, articles, etc.
)Remember that the petit Prototypical Table (Figure 3) is distinct from the Lexeme Table of PETIT:this latter is the model of an adjectival inflectional class identified as being, prototypically, that of PETIT.Actual Lexeme Table are produced in the context of a Lexicographic Process, that is our next topic.4 Lexicographic Process?
Lexeme TablesThe Lexicographic Process is operated through the creation of an association between given lexemes andgiven Prototypical Tables.
Each association performed on a lexeme by the lexicographer produces thegeneration of one or more Lexeme Table(s) for this lexeme.
We detail this process successively for nouns(4.1), adjectives (4.2) and verbs (4.3).4.1 Nominal Lexeme TablesFrench nouns carry grammatical number?singular or plural.
The singular is expressed by a ?-suffix(no addition to the stem).
Canonical nominal plural in French is formed by suffixing the -s suffix tothe nominal stem.
As an example, the two wordforms of ACTEUR ?actor?
are singular acteur and pluralacteurs.
All nominal lexemes inflecting in the canonical way are associated with the Prototypical Tablechat.
Figure 4 illustrates how this association is performed with the Dicet editor.Figure 4: ACTEUR lexeme?chat Prototypical Table associationThere are however cases where the nominal plural is not formed by suffixing -s. Four cases can bementioned.1.
There are unmarked nominal plurals.
This concerns nouns ending with -s, -z or -x, like ABUS ?
[an]abuse?, PRIX ?price?
or RIZ ?rice?, which are invariable.
The Prototypical Table nez ?nose?
hasbeen created to handle such cases.
The association of the Prototypical Table nez with a nominalstem generates two wordforms (one for singular and one for plural) which have an identical signifier(namely, that of the stem).2.
Some nouns are irregular: their inflected forms cannot be computed by means of general morpho-logical rules.
For instance, the plural form of AIL ?garlic?
is aulx, though it can also be expressedby the regular form ails.
To account for this, the lexeme AIL has been connected to the specialPrototypical Table ail which generates a Lexeme Table containing both the regular and irregularplurals: {ail(sing), ails(plur), aulx(plur)}.3.
Lexemes can be defective: there is an ?empty cell?
(or more) in their table of wordforms (Baermanet al., 2010).
For nouns, the defective form is of course either the singular or the plural:?
defective singular: COULEURS III.1b ?colors (= flag or other symbolic object)?;?
defective plural: CIGARETTE II ?habit of smoking?
(Je devrais arr?ter la cigarette ?I shouldquit smoking cigarette?).1604.
Some nouns can have spelling variants for their stem.
(Catach, 1995) and (Sebba, 2003) studiedspelling variations concerning the use of accents, the hyphen, archaic forms, the plural of compoundwords and double consonants.
These possible orthographic variants are recorded as spelling variantsin our resource.
For example, the noun CUILL?RE ?spoon?
has two spellings, cuill?re and cuiller.Consequently, the lexeme CUILL?RE has been coupled with two tables, generating respectively thewordforms {cuill?re(sing), cuill?res(plur)} and {cuiller(sing), cuillers(plur)}.
Most of the time, spellingvariation of the stem follows the last orthographic reform of 1990 (footnote 6 above); in this case,the form recommended by the reform is labelled as ?rectified spelling.
?Unmarkedness (ABUS), irregularity (AIL), defectiveness (COULEURS III.1b) and spelling variation(CUILL?RE) concern not only nouns but also lexemes of other parts of speech, as will be seen in thenext sections.4.2 Adjectival Lexeme TablesAs shown earlier in section 3.1, French adjectives carry both grammatical gender (masculine?
feminine)and number (singular ?
plural).
A few associations of Prototypical Tables with adjectival lexemes areused as illustrations in what follows.Canonical inflection of French adjectives?namely, feminine formed by -e suffixation and plural by-s suffixation?is modeled in the petit ?small?
Prototypical Table.
The association of this table withan adjectival lexeme such as ABSENTAdj?absent?
dynamically generates the table of all correspondingwordforms: {absent(masc, sing), absents(masc, plur), absente(fem, sing), absentes(fem, plur)}.Additionally, a significant number of French adjectives are unmarked for gender?e.g.
EFFICACE?efficient?
{efficace(masc, sing), efficaces(masc, plur), efficace(fem, sing), efficaces(fem, plur)}.
Their wordformsare generated using the aimable Prototypical Table.Beside the two above-mentioned regular cases, many adjectives have rather idiosyncratic behavior.This includes invariability, allomorph stems or spelling variations.1.
Invariable adjectives are lexemes whose wordforms (inflected forms) are based on the same signi-fier.
For example, the adjective DEBOUT ?standing up?
possesses the formally identical wordforms{debout(masc, sing), debout(masc, plur), debout(fem, sing), debout(fem, plur)}, that are generated using thecarmin ?of carmine color?
Prototypical Table.2.
Stem allomorphy can be exemplified with SECAdj?dry?
{sec(masc, sing), secs(masc, plur), s?che(fem, sing),s?ches(fem, plur)} or BREFAdj?brief?
{bref(masc, sing), brefs(masc, plur), br?ve(fem, sing), br?ves(fem, plur)}.
Itis dealt with on a case-by-case basis, with the generation of specific Lexeme Tables.3.
As for nouns, we have to deal with spelling variation of adjectival stems?see the case of AB?M??damaged?
mentioned in section 3.1 above.
This implies the creation of two (or more) LexemeTables for the same lexeme, one for each possible stem.Another difficulty we had to deal with comes from the fact that adjectives may have a particular formwhen they are linearized before a vowel-initial noun (Bonami and Boy?, 2005).
Such is the case ofVIEUX ?old?
:(1) a. Ugo, c?
?tait un vieux copain d?enfance.
?Ugo was an old childhood friend?
[Frantext, IZZO Jean-Claude, Total Kh?ops, 1995, p. 41]b. Apr?s tout, je suis ton plus vieil ami.
?After all, I?m your oldest friend?
[Frantext, BEAUVOIR (de) Simone, Les Mandarins, 1954, p. 364]In order to handle such cases, the lexeme VIEUXAdjis related to the five rather than four wordforms inits Lexeme Table, vieil being encoded as a variant wordform for masculine singular?see Figure 5.161Figure 5: Lexeme Table of VIEUX ?old?Finally, we have included in adjectival Lexeme Tables wordforms that are linguistically possible andattested, though they may seem deviant for conceptual reasons.
For instance, ENCEINTEAdj?pregnant?is naturally related to two feminine wordforms: enceinte(fem, sing)?
enceintes(fem, plur); but in the even-tuality that one does want to talk about a pregnant man (for instance, in order to state that this wouldbe a challenging situation), two distinct pairs of masculine wordforms can be used enceinte(masc, sing)?enceintes(masc, plur)or enceint(masc, sing)?
enceints(masc, plur).
See the following examples found on theInternet:(2) a.
Des jeunes gar?ons enceintes, c?est ce que voient les habitants de Chicago sur leurs pan-neaux publicitaires.
?Young pregnant boys, that?s what people in Chicago see on advertisement billboards?[http://www.grazia.fr/societe/news/etats-unis-des-hommes-enceintes-pour-promouvoir-la-contraception-551492]b.

?In Chicago, advertisements showing pregnant teenage boys have replaced more traditionalones, about condoms and the birth control pill?
[http://www.terrafemina.com/vie-privee/sexo/articles/27026-contraception-des-garcons-enceints-pour-sensibiliser-les-ados-de-chicago.html]These forms, that are amply attested, are labelled as possible in the Lexeme Table of ENCEINTEAdj,where the feminine singular wordform is of course identified as naming form; cf.
Figure 6.Figure 6: Lexeme Table of ENCEINTEAdj?pregnant?162This approach reflects actual usage and is more valid from a linguistic point of view than the alternativesolution that consists in encoding ENCEINTEAdjas defective adjective.4.3 Verbal Lexeme TablesFor lack of space, we provide only an outline of how the rich inflectional morphology of French verbs isbeing handled in our model.
We focus on the most significant aspects of the question only.The pairing of a Prototypical Table with a verbal lexeme implies that information is provided on(i) which auxiliary (avoir or ?tre) is selected by the verb for compound tenses and (ii) whether the verb ispronominal (S?AM?LIORER ?to become better?)
or not (AM?LIORER ?to improve (something)?).
This isillustrated in Figure 7, which shows a short sample of the Lexeme Table of the verb AGACER I ?to annoy?.Figure 7: Lexeme Table (sample) of AGACER I ?to annoy?At present, 34 different Prototypical Tables?such as danser ?to dance?
?have been constructed inorder to generate Lexeme Tables for French verbs of the first conjugation class (premier groupe, in Frenchgrammatical terminology), i.e.
verbs that take the -er infinitive suffix.
Most of these tables were createdin order to handle stem alternations, such as the alternation agac- ?
aga?- for AGACER I in Figure 7.The first conjugation class has the highest cardinality and it is basically the only productive one in con-temporary French.
(Neologisms normally belong to this class.)
There are two other conjugaison classes.Verbs of the second conjugation class are dealt with using 3 Prototypical Tables, and 52 PrototypicalTables have been constructed for verbs of the third class.As for nouns and adjectives, verbs can be defective?11 Prototypical Tables handle defectiveparadigms?and can have spelling variants.
In addition, the morphological model has to deal with sup-pletive verbs?on suppletion, see (Mel?
?cuk, 1994; Bonami and Boy?, 2003; Corbett, 2007).To conclude our description of the morphological Lexicographic Process, it is important to mentionthe fact that an inheritance mechanism has been implemented in the Dicet editor.
Senses that are createdinside an already existing vocable automatically inherit their morphological description from the basiclexical unit of the vocable (the sense controlling the vocable?s polysemic structure).
Inherited morpholog-ical data get a default measure of confidence of 50%.
It has to later be either validated by lexicographers(measure of confidence pushed to 100%) or manually overwritten, if the sense in question has a specificmorphological behavior.5 Concluding remarksThe production of individual Lexeme Tables has started only four months ago, after the complex tasksof designing and implementing the dynamic morphological model had been completed.
For the time163being, approximatively 10% of the vocables (= entries) currently present in the database have beenmorphologically described.7We expect to have finished the morphological work ?on back order?
in the fr-LN database within afew months.
Future developments include:?
the treatment of compounds such as BOULANGER-P?TISSIER lit.
?baker-pastry maker?
{boulanger-p?tissier(sing), boulangers-p?tissiers(plur)} (Mathieu-Colas, 2011);?
the computation of inflected forms of idioms using the encoding of their lexico-syntactic structure;?
the application of our dynamic approach to the modeling of morphology of languages other thanFrench within their lexical networks, starting with the English Lexical Network (en-LN) presentedin (Gader et al., 2014).AcknowledgmentsWork on the fr-LN is supported by a grant from the Agence de Mobilisation ?conomique de Lorraine(AMEL) and Fonds Europ?en de D?veloppement R?gional (FEDER).
