univ-par is 13. frAbst rac tWe propose a treatment of coordinationbased on the concepts of functor, argumentand subcategorization.
Its formalizationcomprises two parts which are conceptuallyindependent.
On one hand, we have ex-tended the feature structure unification todisjunctive and set values in order to checkthe compatibility and the satisfiability ofsubcategorization requirements by struc-tured complements.
On the other hand, wehave considered the conjunction e$ (and)as the head of the coordinate structure,so that coordinate structures tem simplyfrom the subcategorization specifications ofet and the general schemata of a head sat-uration.
Both parts have been encodedwithin HPSG using the same resource thatis the subcategorization a d its principlewhich we have just extended.

)We claim here that the "local combinatory poten-tial" of lexical heads, encoded in the subcategoriza-tion feature, explains the previous linguistic facts:conjuncts may be of different categories as well as ofmore than one constituent, hey just have to satisfythe subcategorization constraints.1 IntroductionCoordination has Mways been a centre of academicinterest, be it in linguistic theory or in computa-tional linguistics.
The problem is that the assump-tion according to only the constituents of the samecategory (1) may be conjoined is false; indeed, coor-dinations of different categories (2)-(3) and of morethan one constituent (4)-(5) should not be dismissedthough being marginal in written texts and must heaccounted for 1.1This research as been done for the French coordi-nation et (and).We focus here on the coordination of syntagmaticcategories (as opposite of lexical categories).
Moreprecisely, we account for cases of non constituentcoordination (4), of Right Node Raising (5) but notfor cases of Gapping.Our approach which is independent of any frame-work, is easily and precisely encoded in the for-malism of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar(HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994), which is based onthe notion of head and makes available the featuresharing mechanism we need.
The paper is organizedas follows.
Section 2 gives a brief description of ba-sic data and discusses ome constraints and avail-able structures.
Section 3 summarizes previous ap-proaches and section 4 is devoted to our approach.The french coordination with el serves throughoutthe paper as an example.1242 A br ie f  descr ip t ion  o f  Bas ic  Dataand  Const ra in tsThe classical typology of coordination, i.e.
coordi-nation of constituents (1) and of non-constituents,hides some regularity of the phenomenon as it fo-cuses on concepts of constituent and syntactic ate-gory.A coordination of constituents i interpreted asone phrase without any gap.
The constituents maybe of the same category (1) as well as of differentcategories (2)-(3).
However, this last case is con-strained as examplified hereafter 2.

)(2e) *\]e rends \]'addition et que quelqu'un paie.
*(I give back the bill and someone to pay.
)In these examples, the coordinate structure acts asthe argument of the verb.
This verb must subcate-gorize for each constituent of the coordination andthis is not the case in example (2c)-(2e).
Note thatmodelizing coordination of different categories as theunification (i.e.
underspecification) of the differentcategories would lead to accept the six examplesor wrongly reject (2d) according to the descriptionsused 3.Coordination of more than one constituent are of-ten classified as Conjunction Reduction (4), Gap-ping ( la- lb) and Right Node Raising (5) (Hudson,1976).

(Yesterday, Jean danced the waltz and today, thetango.
)In the case of Gapping structures, the subject (la)and/or an extracted element (lb) is present in thetwo sides.
The only allowed coordinated structureis \[Jean danse la valse\] et \[Pierre le tango\] for (la)and \[Hier, Jean a dansd la valse\] et \[aujourd'hui, letango\] for ( lb) as wh-sentences on other parts (\[lavalse\] el \[Pierre\]or \[la valse\] el \[Pierre le langoj~ areimpossible.A contrario, in the case of Conjunction Reduc-tions, wh-sentences as well as cliticization are al-2The star * marks ungrammatical sentences.3Apart from ad hoc modelizations.lowed referring to what follows the verb (as for coor-dination of constituents) and treating the argumentssimultaneously on the two parts of the coordination:(4a) Je sais k qui demander un v~lo e tune  cannep~che.

)Let us remark that a comma is inserted betweenMarie and sa canne ~ p~che in case of extractionbefore el as in (lb), indicating the two sentenceshave not necessarily to be analyzed in the same way:(4e) Je demande ?
Pierre son v~lo et ?
Marie sacanne ~ p~che.
(I ask Peter for his bike and Marie for her fishingrod.
)(4f) A Pierre, je demande son v~lo et ?
Marie, sacanne ~ p~che.
(Peter, I ask for a bike and Marie, for a fishingrod.
)Two structures are available in case of Conjunc-tion Reductions.
One structure corresponds to a co-ordination of sentences with a gap of the verb afterel, the other one consists in taking the coordinateparallel sequence of constituents as only one struc-ture.
The previous facts argue for the second pos-sibility (see also section 3 for criticism of deletionapproach).Last, note that gapping the verb is less compati-ble with head-driven mechanisms (and the comma in(4f) could be such a head mark, see (BEF, 1996) foran analysis of Gapping coordinations).
It seems thenthat the structure needed for Conjunction Reduc-tion is some generalization of the standard structureused for coordination of constituents.
Our proposalis then focused on this extension.
We do not care ofGapping cases as their linguistic properties eem tobe different.It remains to integrate Right-Node Raising and toextend these cases to more complicated ones.
Sec-tion 4 includes examples of such cases and showsthat our proposal can manage them adequately.3 Previous ApproachesThere exists a classical way to eschew the question"what can be coordinated ?"
if one assumes a dele-tion analysis.
Indeed, according to this approach(Chomsky, 1957; Banfield, 1981), only coordinationof sentences are basic and other syntagmatic coordi-nations should be considered as coordinations of re-duced sentences, the reduction being performed bydeleting repeated elements.
This approach comes up125against insurmountable obstacles, chiefly with theproblem of applying transformation i reverse, inthe analysis process (Schachter, 1973).A direct approach as been proposed at once bySag & al.
(Sag et al, 1985) within the frameworkof Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG),by (Pollard and Sag, 1994) within HPSG, and(Bresnan, 1986) within Lexical Functional Grammar(LFG).
These approaches have tried to account forcoordination of different categories in reducing theconstraint from requiring the same category for con-juncts to a weaker constraint of category compat-ibility.
Whatever the nature of subcategorizationinformation may be, syntactical in GPSG, hybrid inHPSG, functional in LFG, two categories are com-patible if they subsume a "common denominator",in this case a common partial structure.Technically, the compatibility is checked by com-puting a "generalization" of categories and imposingthe generalization comprises all features expected inthe given context.
For example, the context in (6),that is, the verb ~tre (to be), expects a predicativeargument and both categories NP and AP are justpredicative categories.
(6) I1 est le p~re de Marie et tier de l'~tre.
(He is Mary's father and proud of it.
)However, this solution cannot be applied gener-ally because all coordinations have not such "natu-ral" intersection (see (2)).
So we claim that we havenothing else to do but explicitly enumerate, withinthe head subcategorization feature, all the structuresallowed as complement.4 Our ApproachOur proposition involves three stages.
We beginby formulating constraints on coordinate structures,then we define how to build the coordinate struc-tures and we end by specifying how the previousconstraints filter through such coordinate structures.4.1 Const ra in ts  on coord inate  s t ructuresIn order to precisely formulate the constraints on co-ordinate structures, we distinguish the role of func-for and that of argument, where functor categoriesare those that bear unsatisfied subcategorization re-quirements, as it is the case in CategoriM Grammars(Dowty, 1988).
Lexical heads (1) are functors in re-lation to the arguments they select and, by compo-sition, any expression that contains an unsaturatedfunctor is a functor (5)-(7).
(7) I1 pretend d~tester et refuse ces beaux spotslumineux.
(He claims to hate and refuses these beautifulspotlights.
)Arguments are the complements selected by thehead 4.
An argument may often be realized by differ-ent categories.
For example, the argument requiredby savoir (to know) may be a NP or a Comple-tive: we say that the requirement is disjunctive andwe represent he different alternatives within sub-categorization feature disjunctive values.
An argu-ment specification is then a disjunction of categories.When the lexical head requires everal complements(to ask somebody something), the requirement is saidmultiple or n-requirement.
To the extent that dis-junction only appears in argument specifications, an-requirement is a multi-set of simple requirements.The choice of set (or more precisely multiset) ratherthan list vMue for the feature SUBCAT allows us toaccount for Je demande ~ Pierre son vdlo as well asJe demande son vdlo ~ Pierre.
Gunji (Gunji, 1987)makes the same choice.
However our criterion canbe formalized in a theory whose order of argumentsobeys to an obliqueness hierarchy.Requ i rement  inher i tance.
A functor may com-pose with another functor or with arguments.
Infunctor-arguments composition, the resulting ex-pression inherits the unsatisfied requirement fromthe functor when it is not empty.
For example, in(5), both conjuncts inherit the unsatisfied require-ment from their heads.
Likewise the functor com-position inherits a requirement from the unsatisfiedfunctor ~.
In (7), pretend d~tester inherits the unsat-isfied requirement of d~tester, i.e.
the requirementof an object.Ad juncts .
To account for the continuum whichexists from strictly subcategorized complements oadjuncts, we adopt the hypothesis uggested by(Miller, 1991) according to which adjuncts couldbe accorded the same status as arguments by inte-grating them into the subcategorization requirementthrough an optional exical rule.
That would enableus to account for coordination of adjuncts of differ-ent categories (3) as well as coordination of morethan one constituent with adjuncts (10)-(11) below.Note that we may still have a special feature AD-JUNCT in order to distinguish adjuncts from othercomplements if necessary.
Note also that these lexi-cal rules can be interpreted statically as well as dy-namicMly.
In the first case, the extended lexicon ispre-computed and requires no runtime application.4In this paper, we restrict arguments ocomplements.In our HPSG encoding, they are treated in the SUBCATfeature.
In a Borsley-like manner, we suppose a specialfeature for the subject.
However, our approach can begeneralized to subjects.5In functor composition, functors cannot be both un-saturated: ~" 1l promet de manger d sa m~re des ba-nanes.
(* he promises to eat his mother bananas.
), cf.the Incomplete Constituent Constraint (Pollard and Sag,1994).126Sat is f iabi l i ty  cond i t ions  of  requ i rements .We observe here that a coordination of different cat-egories may appear as head complement when thehead requirement is disjunctive and a coordinationof more than one constituent appears when such arequirement is multiple.
Last, functors may conjoinwhen their subcategorization requirements are com-patible.
These observations are synthesized in onecoordination criterion.The first observation is summarized in (C1) andillustrated in (2').
(C1) A subcategorization 1-requirement is satis-fied either by one of the disjuncts or by a coordi-nation of disjuncts.
(2') Je sais son ~ge/qu'el le est venue ici / son ?geet qu'elle est venue iei.
(I know her age/that she came here \[ her age andthat she came here.
)The second one is illustrated below, where subcat-egorization -requirements are satisfied either by:?
a series of n complements which satisfy respec-tively the n requirements(8) Je demande ~ Pierre son v@lo et sa cannep@che.
(I ask Peter for his bike and for his fishingrod.)?
a coordination of a series of this kind(9) Je demande & Pierre son v@lo et ~ Maried'ofl elle vient.
(I ask Peter for his bike and Mary where shecomes from.)?
a coordination may concern sub-series of argu-ments(10) Pierre a achet@ un livre & Marie etun disque ?
Pierre pour 100F.
(Peter has bought a book for Mary and a CDfor Peter for 205.)?
or sequences of more than one constituent withadjuncts (11)(11) J'ai vu Pierre hier et Marie lundi.
(I have seen Peter yesterday and Marymonday.)?
or adjuncts of different categories (3).

(An interesting book and which I will enjoyto read.
)All these situations are summarized in (C2):(C2) A subcategorization n-requirement is satis-\]fled by m arguments,0 < m < n~ either by a se- \[quence of m arguments such That each argument \[satisfies one and only one element of the require- Iment or by a coordination of such sequences.
The Iresult has a n -- m requirement.
\]Coord inat ion cr i te r ion  : sat is fy ing and  im-pos ing requ i rements .
As an entity can be bothfunctor and argument (12)-(13) our coordination cri-terion (necessary condition) is the following one: theconjuncts must satisfy the same simple or multiplesubcategorization requirement and impose compati-ble subcategorization requirements.4.2 Comput ing  the  subcategor i za t ionrequ i rements  compat ib i l i tyWe have now to define an extension of the usualunification U of structures in order to compute thesubcategorization requirements compatibility.
Thisextension is an internal operation over the subcate-gorization requirements which accounts for disjunc-tive and set values.

In this case ~U+@ = {ai/g/3p\[i\]/i E\[1, n\]) else ~L/+~ is undefined.Note that (C1) and (C2) should be computed si-multaneously in order to account for structures as(9).
The notion of partial saturation in (C2) allowsus to account for coordination of sub-series of argu-ments as in (10).~hnctors  coord inat ion and compat ib i l i ty  ofrequ i rements .
Functors may be simple (1), com-posed (7), of different structures (12) or partiallysaturated (13)-(5).

Pierre ducaviar de Russie.
(I expect o receive from John and offer to PeterRussian caviar.
)In all cases, when they are conjoined, they sharetheir arguments: there must therefore xist at leastone possibility of satisfying them simultaneously.
Inthis case, the unification of their subcategorizationrequirements succeeds and they are said to be com-patible and the two functors may be conjoined.
Thisunification has to account for disjunctive values.127I Two n-requirements are compatible iff their uni- If ication//+ succeeds.
IWe consider that conjoined functors should havethe same valence 6.
Note that the unification of twon-requirements is ambiguous because we may haveseveral permutations which lead to success.4.3 How coord inate  s t ruc tures  are bui l tUntil now we have just defined constraints on thecoordinate structures but we did not mention howthese structures are built.
We want that a coordi-nate structure inherits features from its conjunctswithout necessarily failing in case of conflicting val-ues.
The generalization method (Sag et al, 1985)has this objective but overgenerates because the con-flicting values are ignored.
In contrast, the use ofcomposite categories (Cooper, 1991) keeps conflict-ing values within the connective "A".
Intuitively,if son age (her age) is a NP and qu'elle est venueici (that she came here) is a Completive, son dge etqu 'elle es~ venue ici (her age and tha~ she came here)is a conjunctive composite category NPACompl.The s t ruc tur ing  of  categor ies : compos i teand tup le  of  categories.
We propose to extendthe operation A to complex categories and to usea new connective < .. .
> in order to define tupleof categories.
With these two connectives, a totalstructuring of categories i possible and all the coor-dinate structures may have a status.
For example,the underlined expression in (14) will be representedby the structured category: (pp, \[NPACornpl\] \ LSubcat PP J/"(14) Je recommande ~ Pierre la lecture etqu'il s'inspire de la Bible.
(I recommend to Peter the lecture and that heinspires himself of the Bible.
)The extension to complex categories is not uni-form.
Coordinate structure features are not neces-sarily composites or tuples of corresponding featuresfrom each conjunct.
In fact, features which are al-lowed to have conflicting values will be compounded,whereas other features as SUBCAT must unify.
Thisstructuring is encoded later within the definition ofthe lexical entry of et.Lexica l izat ion of  the  coord inat ion  rule.
Weconsider, as in (Paritong, 1992), the conjunctionet as the head of the coordinate structure.
Con-sequently, coordinate structures no longer have tobe postulated in the grammar by a special rule ofcoordination: they stem simply from the general6This condition will forbid the conjunction of e.g.verbs with SUBCAT lists of different lengths, but whichwould have a unification under the alternative interpre-tation, thus avoiding sentences like *John bought andgave the book to Mary, (Miller, 1991).schemata of the head saturation and the subcatego-rization specifications ofthe conjunction.
For sake ofsimplicity, only binary coordination is treated here.
(Paritong, 1992) accounts for multiple coordinationas a binary structure where the comma has a simi-lar function as a lexical conjunction.
With that onerestriction, the tIPSG-like lexical entry of et can be:I Phon \et\  Synsern <\[x l , .

However, the functor this coordinate struc-ture (partially-)saturates may impose its own LP-constraint (e.g.
an obliqueness hierarchy).
In sucha case, this LP-constraint has to be satisfied si-multaneously by the two sets {\[1\],.

)4.4 How the  constra ints  apply  oncoord inate  s t ruc turesWe have now to define how arguments satisfy dis-junctive and set requirements.
Intuitively, if ai isa (possibly disjunctive) argument specification, anargument (possibly composite) satisfies ai iff eachelement of the composite category matches one dis-junct of ai.
Then, if ff is a n-requirement, a tuple(or a coordination of tuples) of categories (possiblycomposite) satisfies ff iff each element of the tuple(for each tuple) satisfies one and only one argumentspecification of ft.

Onone hand, we have extended the feature structureunification to disjunctive and set values in order tocheck the compatibility and the satisfiability of sub-categorization requirements by structured comple-ments.
On the other hand, we have considered theconjunction et as the head of the coordinate struc-ture, so that coordinate structures stem simply fromthe subcategorization specifications of et and a gen-eral schemata of the head saturation.
Both partshave been encoded within HPSG using the same re-source that is the subcategorization and its principlewhich we have just extended.It remains to know in which extent our ap-proach can be used for other linguistic phenomenawith symetrical sequences of more than one con-stituent (comparative constructions, Mternative con-structions):(16) Paul donne autant de couteaux aux filles quede pi~ces aux garcons.
