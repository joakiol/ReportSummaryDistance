The discourse functions of Italian subjects:a centering approachBarbara Di EugenioComputat iona l  L inguist icsCarneg ie  Mel lon Un ivers i tyP i t t sburgh ,  PA, 15213 USAdieugeni(c~.andrew.cmu.eduAbstractThis paper examines the discourse fluic-tions that different types of subjectsperform in Italian within the centeringframework (Grosz el; al., 1995).
I buildon my previous work (Di gugenio, 1990)that accounted for the alternation of nulland strong prottouns in subject position.I extend my previous atialysis in severalwws: for examI)le, I refine the notionof CONTINUE altd discuss the centeringfunctions of full NPs.1 Introduct ionhiterpreting referential expressions is importatltfor any large coverage NL system; while such sys-tems do exist for Italian, e.g.
(Stock et al, 1993;Lombardo and Lesmo, 1994), to my knowledgenot mudi attention has been devoted to the inter-pretation of Italian referential expressions.
Someexceptions are (Samek-Lodovici and Strapparava,1990), that discusses interpretation of referentialexpressions within dialogues to access a videodiscon Italimi art; (Not and Zancanaro, 1995), thatadopts a systemic gra,nmar approadi (Halliday,1976); and (Di Eugenio, 1990), which uses center-ing theory (Grosz et al, 1995) to account for thealternation of null and strong subjects.hi this paper, I build on and expand (Di Eu-genio, 1990) in several ways.
First, I reanalyzcthe hypotheses I proposed earlier with respect oa corl)uS of naturally occurring data} I showthat those hypotheses are basically supported,iThe examples in (Di Euge.nio, 199{)) wereconstructed.and that when they aren't an elegant explmia-tion can be found by looking at a two membersequence of ce,ttering tra,tsitions rather than atjust ()tie transition.
Second, I extend my previousanalysis by also discussing the centering functionsof full NPs in subject position, and some occur-rences of pronotuis tuiaccounted for by centering.2 Centering theoryCentering the.ory (Grosz et al, 1986; Brennan ctal., 1987; Grosz et al, 1995) models local coher-e.nee in discourse: it keet)s track of how local focusvaries from one utterance to the next.
(\]enteringpostulates that: ~* Each utterance Un has associated with it a setof discourse ntities, the FOH.WAI{I)-LOO|<IN(~ CEN-TERS or Cfs.
The Cf list is ranked according todiscourse salience.- The I{ACKWARD-LOOKIN(\] CENTEI{~ or Cb~ ix thetmember of the Cf list that lJ,~ most centrally con-cerns~ attd that links U~ to the previous discourse.
* Finally, the PI%EFERI{.ED CENTEI{, or Cp: is thehighest rauked member of the Of list.
The Cp rep-resents a prediction about die Cb of the followingutterance.Transitions between two adjacent utterancesU,>_I and U,~ can be characterized asa function oflooking backward whether Cb(Un) is the sameas Cb(Un 1) - attd of looking forward whetherCb(Ur~) is the same as Cp(U,~).

Froma cognitive t)erst)ec.tive, it explains certain ph(;-nOlilella of local discourse, eohe.reuce (e.g.
prolloln-inal "garden l )aths') ,  and is supported by psy-cholinguisti(, e.xperiments (Gordon et al, 1993).Computational ly,  it is a simple mechanism, andthus it has been the basis for simple algoridm~sfor anaphora resolution (Brennan el; al., 1987).Much work still remains to t)e done on (:en-tering.
For examph;, most (tevelol)menl, so l\]u'has been based on simt)lc eonsLrucl;ed (;xamples:to aI:)ply centering to real text, issues such ashow possessives and subordimtte clauses al'feet re.-ferring expression resolution lnust t)e addressed.This paper is a contribution in that dire.orion.3 The Italian pronominal systemItal ian has two pronominal  systems (CabJ)rese,1986): weak l)ronouns, th;tt iIlust always be c.liti-cized to the verb (e.g.
Io, le, gli - respeetiw:ly him,accusative; them, feminine accusative or her, da-tive.
; him, dative), and strong t)ronouns (\[ui, tei,353Ioro - respee.tively tie or hiln; she or her; they orthem).4 The null subject is considered part of thesystem of weak pronouns.Weak and strong pronouns are often in comple-mentary distribution, as strong pronouns have tobe used in prepositional phrases, e.g.
per lui, forhim.
However, this syntactic alternation doesn'tapl)ly in subject position.
The choice of null ver-sits strong pronoun de.ponds on pragmatic factors;the centering explanation offered in (Di Eugenio,1990) goes as follows:(3a) Typically, a nltll subject signals a CONTINUE,&lid a strong pronotin a RE'FAIN or a SIIIFT.
(3b) A null subject can be felicitously used ineases of RETAIN or SHIFT if in U,~ the syn-tactic context tip to and including the ver-bal form(s) carrying tense and / or agreementforces the null subject to refer to a particularreferent and not to Cb(U,~ l)-The evidence for (3b) provided in (Di Eug(>nio, 1990) derived, among others, from modal andcontrol verb constructions, in which clitics maybe clitieized to the infinitival complement of thehigher verb or may climb in front of the higherverb.
Wheu the clitic climbs, certain pronomiual"garden path" effects, deriving from a wrong in-terpretation initially assigned to the null slibjectand later retracted, are avoided.4 I ta l ian  sub jec ts  in  d i scourse4.1 The  corpusThe corpus amounts to about 25 pages of text,and 12,000 words; it is composed of excerpts fromtwo books (yon Arnim, 1989; Fallaci, 1989), aletter (Mila, 1993), a posting on the Italian bul-letin board (SCI, 1994), a short story (Nichetti,1993), and three articles from two newspapers (delBuono, 1993; Pagetti, 1993; La Nazione, 1994).The excerpts are of different lengths, with the ex-cerI)tS from the two books being the longest.Texts were chosen to cover a variety of contem-porary written Italian prose, from formal (news-paper articles about politics mid literature), to in-formal (posting on the Italian bulletin board), andaccording to the following criteria: a) ,ninimal di-rect speech, which has not been addressed iu cen-4kui, lei, Ioro are the oblique forms of the strongsystem, while the nonfinative \[brms are respectivelyegN, ella, essi/e: in current Italian the latter forms arerarely used as the oblique forms have replaced them insubject position in my corpus there are only fouroccurrences of these nominative forms, and they alloccur ii~ the same article (Pagetti, 1993).tering yet; b) prose that describes ituations in-volving several animate refe, rents, bee, ause strongt)ronouns can refer only to animate referents.Table 2 shows the distrit)ution of animate thirdperson subjects partitioned into: full NPsthe numbers in parentheses refer to possessiveNPs; strong pronouns; null subje(;ts I countedonly those whose antecedents are not determinedby contraindexing constraints (Chomsky, 1981).
;other anaphors (e.g.
tutte, allI~,,,) they won'tbe analyzed in this pat)er.4.2 IssuesWhen applying (:entering to real text, one realizesthat lnany issues have, llOt been solved yet.
I willcomment here on how deictics, possessives, andsubordinate clauses affect centering.Deict ics  such its I, you, etc.
The problem iswhether they are part of the Cf list or not.
Ifollow (Walker, 1993) in assuming that deicticsare always available as part of global h)cus, andtherefore are outside centering.Possess ives.
Table 3 includes a categorymarked possessive, which refers to hill NPs thatinchtde a possessive adjective referring to an ani-mate entity, such as i suoi sforzi -his cfforts.The problem is how possessives affect Cb com-putation and Cf ordering.
While Cb computationdoes not appear to be affected by a possessive,that behaves like a i)ronoun, the Cf ranking ueedsto be modified.
An NP of type possessive refersto two entities, the possessor Po,.
and the pos-sessed P~d.
P~,d corresponds to the full NP, andthus its position in Cf is determined by the NP'sgrammatical flmction; as regards P,,., my workingheuristics is to rank it as iinmediately precedingP~d if P~d is inanimate, as immediately followingP~.~t if P~d is animate.
Such heuristics appears towork, t)ut needs to be rigorously teste.d.Subord inates .
Another important issue, thathas not been extensively addressed ye.t - but see(Kameyama, 1997; Snri and McCoy, 1993) ishow to deal with complex sentences that includecoordinates and subordinates.
The questions thatarise concern whether there are independent Cb'sand Cf lists for every clause; if not, how the Cbof the complex sentence is computed, and how se-mantic entities appearing in different clauses areordered on the global Cf list.In this paper, I will loosely adopt Kmneyama'sproposal (1997) that sentences containing con-jtlncts and tensed adjuncts are broken down iiito alinear sequence of centering "units", while tense-354Tex|;-~ i i -  Arnim, 1989)(Falbmi, 1989)(Mila, 1993)(sc, I, ~994)(Nichet Li, 1993)((h'.l Buono, 1993)(Pago.t,t;i, 1993)(La Na.zione, 1994)Tot,alTotal111178184(1362235287Full NPs45 (11)6 (0)7 (:t)2(~ (~.
