Thebitext used for experimentation has two mainfeatures: (i) it contains bilingual documentsfrom a dedicated omain of legal and admin-istrative publications rich in specialized jar-gon; (ii) it involves two languages, Spanish andBasque, which are typologically very distinct(both lexically and morpho-syntactically).
Theformer feature provides a good basis for testingtechniques of collocation detection.
The latterpresents quite a challange to a number of re-ported algorithms, in particular to the align-ment of sentence internal segments.1 Tagged b i texts  as la rge  languageresourcesMuch literature has been produced in thearea of sentence alignment of parallel biligualcorpora or bitexts.
Fewer references con-cern the alignment of intra-sentential segmentssuch as word or multiword collocations (Eijk93), (Kupiek 93), (Dagan & Church 94), and(Smadja et al 96).
The difficulty of aligning bi-texts depends of a number of factors such as thequality of the bitext (whether is truely parallelor not), the proximity between the languages(either structurally, morpho-syntactically or al-phabetically), the additional coded informationthat bitexts may have (richer or poorer mark-up), among others.While stuying bitext alignment echniques itwas decided that an optimal approach was totag the corpus.
Descriptive annotations canaccount for linguistic information at all levels,from discourse structure to phonetic features, aswell as semantics, yntax and morphology.
Theprocess of annotating the corpus in this man-ner is very labour intensive, even when largelyautomated, however it produces rewarding re-sults.
Thoroughly tagged bitexts become richand productive language resources (Abaitua etal.
98).
SGML based TEI conformant mark-up(Ide & Veronis 95) has been the adopted mark-up option and it was discussed in (Martinez etal.
97).Continuing with the work of (Martinez etal.
98), where sentence alignment based onrich mark-up was described, we present heretwo further achievements.
Section 2 shows howproper names have been aligned, and Section 3presents the techniques employed in attemptingthe aligning of multiword collocations.
Resultsare evaluated in Section 4 and Section 5 offerssome discussion.2 P roper  name a l ignment2.1 P roper  name tagg ingThe module for the recognition of proper namesrelies on patterns of typography (capitalisationand punctuation) and on contextual informa-tion.
It also makes use of lists with most com-mon person, organisation, law, publication andplace names.
The tagger annotates a multi-word chain as a proper name <rs> when eachword in the chain is uppercase initial.
A closedlist of functional words (prepositions, conjunc-tions, determiners, etc.)
is allowed to appear102inside the proper name chain, see examples inTable 1.
A collection of heuristics discard up-percase initial words in sentence initial positionor in other exceptional cases.Just us (Smadja et al 96) distinguished be-tween two types of collocations, we too distin-guish between:F ixed names:  Compound proper nameslabeled 'fixed', such as Boletin Oficial deBizkaia, are rigid compounds.
Spanishproper names all correspond to this type.F lexible names:  Compound propernames labeled 'flexible' are compoundsthat can be separated by interveningtext elements such as in AdrninistrazioPublikoetarako Ministeritzaren <date>.
.</date> Agindua, where a date splits thetokens within the compound.
There is asmall but significative number of these inBasque, as has been previously noted by(Aduriz et al 96b).After proper names have been successfullyidentified (Table 2), the next step is their align-ment.
Two types of alignment can take place:?
1 to 1 a l ignment :  one to one correspon-dence between fixed names in the sourceand target documents.?
1 to N a l ignment :  one to none or morethan one correspondences between fixednames in the source language and flexiblenames in the target language.Alignment has been achieved by resorting to:1.
Proper name categorization, as shown inTable 1....Reduction of the alignment space to previ-ously aligned sentences,Identification of cognate nouns, aided bya set of phonological rules that apply whenBasque loan terms are directly derived fromSpanish terms.The application of the TasC algorithm(Martinez et al 98) adapted to propername alignment.2.2 Ident i f i cat ion  of  cognatesPoints one and two above may suffice to work upthe alignment of fixed proper names belongingto a single category that shows up only oncein the alignment space (i.e.
in the sentence).Nevertheless, there can be sentences with flexi-ble proper names or more than one fixed propername belonging to the same category.
There-fore it may be necessary to determine the cor-rect alignment among possible candidates.
Asadditional criteria in these cases we reinforcethe identification of lexical cognates with a setof phonological correlation rules.These are two examples of phonological cor-relation rules:(i) The Spanish prefix 'tel-' always correlateswith the prefix 'erl-' in Basque loans (e.g.reloj / erloju; relacidn / erlazio)(ii) The Spanish suffix '-cidn' often correlateswith the suffix '-zio' in Basque loans (e.g.nocidn / nozio; adrninistracidn / adminis-trazio)We use a set of up to 33 rules of this type.
Forsome loan terms in Basque e.g.
universidad /unibertsitate), several of these rules may apply:-v- ~ -b- ;-rs- ~ -rts- ;-dad ~ -tare.Although the application of these phonolog-ical rules for identifying Basque loan words isquite regular, not every new term in Basqueis derived in this way.
In many other cases aSpanish term has a genuine Basque counterpart,(e.g.
sociedad / elkarte).
In any case, this setof phonological rules provides a very efficientaid for the identification of a high proportion ofSpanish/Basque cognates (86.45 % on average,as shown in Table 3).Therefore, when aligning proper names, cog-nate identification will help not only in obviouscases such as personal or place names, but alsoin categories of proper names such as organiza-tion, law or title.2.3 Ca lcu la t ing  the  s imi la r i ty  betweenBasque  and  Span ish  proper  namesIn order to determine whether two propernames belonging to the same category are trans-lation equivalencies of each other, Dice's coeffi-cient (Dice 45) is applied in two phases: first attoken level and then, at proper name level.103Categories \]1" Spanish BasquePerson Javier Otazua Barrena Javie~" Otazua BarrenaPlace Amorebieta-Etzano Arnorebieta-EtzanoCorredor del Cadagua Kadaguako pasabideaBilbao c/ Alameda Rekalde Bilboko Errekalde ZumarkalekoOrganization Ayuntamiento de Areatza Areatzako udalakRegistro de la Propiedad Jabegoaren erroldaritzanSala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Euskal Herriko Justizia Auzitegi NagusikoTribunal Superior de Justicia del Pals Vasco Administraziozko Liskarrauzietarako SalariLaw Impuesto sobre la Renta Errentaren gaineko ZergariPlan Especial de Reforma Interior Barne-Eraberritzearen Plan BeretziaNorrnativa de Rehabilif, aei6n Birgaikuntzari buruzko AraukoTitle Jefe del Servicio de Administraci6n de Zuzeneko Zeryen AdministrazioTributos Directos Zerbitzuko buruarenDiputado Foral de Hacienda y Finanzas Ogasun eta Finantzen foru diputatuaPublication Boletln de Bizkaia Bizkaiko AldizkariBoletin Oficial del Pals Pasco Euskal Herriko Aldizkari OfizialeanUncategorized Estudio de Detalle Azterlan ZehatzarakoAcci6n Comunitaria Erkidego EkintzapidearenDocumento Nacional de ldentidad Nortasun Agiri NazionalarenTable 1: Examples of proper namesProper Name Classes \[PersonPlaceOrganisationLawTitlePublicationUncategorisedTotalPrecision I Recall 1% Spanish PN Precision I rtecall 1% Basque PN100% 100% 4.48%100% 100% 6.38%99.2% 97.8% 23.96%99.2% 99.2% 47.93%100% 100% 6.55%100% 100% 2.58%lOO% lOO% 8.10%99.4% 199.1% 100%100% 100% 4.76%100% 100% 6.95%100% 100% 24.17%100% 100% 46.15%97.2% 97.2% 6.59%100% 100% 2.74%100% 100% 8.6099.8% 99.8% I 100%Table 2: Results of proper name identification1.
In the first level, each token in the sourceproper name is compared with all the to-kens in the target proper name.
In or-der to determine whether two tokens arecognates, bigrams are compared trying toapply, if they are not equal, the rules ofphonological derivation.
Only when the re-sulting coefficient is bigger than a thresh-old, the tokens are considered cognates.The threshold has been established in 0.5as a result of different experimental tests.2.
In the second level, given a source and atarget proper name, their similarity is de-termined according to the number of cog-nate tokens that exist between them.

</s>Figure 1: Example of non-literal translationr i thm can be applied.
The alignment algorithmhas been borrowed from (Martinez et al 98)with minor differences.?
The first difference is the criteria by meansof which the similarity amongst alignablecandidates i determined.
While sentencesare aligned on the basis of the similarity ofthe annotations they contain, proper namesare aligned on the basis of their belongingto the same category as well as by matchingcognate tokens.?
The second ifference is the relevance of theorder of alignable elements in the bitext.While in sentence alignment there are con-straints regarding ordering and grouping toreduce the number of cases to be evaluated,in the aligning of proper names constraintscannot be applied because ordering is notpredictable.Due to non-literal translations, 12% of theidentified proper names have no exact counter-part in the other language (see Figure 1).
Inthis case, the Basque sentence does not havethe proper name of the law Orden Foral but theanaphoric nominal honako erabakia, 'this reso-lution'.
In the corpus, there are 6% more propername in the Spanish side of the bitext than inthe Basque side.Table 3 shows the accuracy of this alignmentstrategy.
Proper names with no counterparthave not been considered.
Figure 3 illustratesan instance of how aligned proper names aretagged in the bitext.3 A l ignment  o f  co l locat ions(Smadja et al 96), (Dagan ~ Church 94),(Kupiek 93) and (Eijk 93) approach the align-ment of multiword collocations resorting to anumber of complementary techniques:(i) Noun(ii)(iii)phrase collocations: All butSmadja narrow the scope of collocations tonoun phrases.
Smadja is the only one thatattempts to treat other phrases (such asverb phrases as well what he labels 'flex-ible phrases').Delimited search space: All but Churchdelimit the search space to already alignedsentences.
Church in turn departs from acorpus of aligned words.POS tagging:  All but Smadja employPart of Speech (POS) taggers.We also employ techniques (ii) and (iii), butwe introduce three additional resources: Abilingual glossary, a bilingual contrastive gram-mar, as well as the structural markup whichalredy exists in the bitext.
In addition, we alsoconsider verb prases.The approach discribed below illustrateswork in progress on how we try to optimizethe alignment process by combining those tech-niques.
Collocations are aligned in six steps.The first three steps are meant to detect can-didate collocations in both languages.
The lastthree axe directly involved in the alignment.. Word  cooccurrence frequency: Due tothe specialized nature of the bitext, anyword cooccurrence that superates a giventhreshold is considered to be a collocationcandidate.
This threshold depends on thesize of the corpus, but even a low figureas 2 can be considered significative enough.A tool for word cooccurrence detection hasbeen implemented.
This tool is sensitiveto SGML tags and it uses a window ofmax imum ten words.

POS tagging: A tagged version of theSpanish text was supplied by the NaturalLanguage Research Group at the Univer-sitar Polit~cnica de Catalunya (M~quez &Padr6 97).
The Basque text was taggedby the IXA group from the Euskal HerrikoUnibertsitatea (Aduriz et al 96a), (see Fig-ure 5).3.
NP,  VP  grammars :  Simple noun phraseand verb phrase patterns have been usedto detect candidate collocations and to fil-ter out inapproppriate word cooccurrences.By means of this technique, 80% of the de-tected word cooccurrences are discarded.Basque and Spanish phrases how great di-vergences, and for the alignment procedureto succed, it has been necessary to imple-ment an additional resource: a correspon-dence table with grammatical patterns forSpanish and Basque phrases (see Table 4).4.
Bi l ingual  glossary lookup: This is avery useful resource containing over 15,000aligned entries.
The glossary was devel-oped by the same translators that were incharge of the corpus we are working with.Yet, the glossary, although it is availableon-line, translators have not applied it sys-tematically and frequent divergences arise(compare Figure 4 with Figure 6).5.
Search wi th in  a l igned sentences:Aligned senteces delimit the search spacethereby reducing the complexity of thealignment.6.
Human val idat ion: The final step in-volves human intervention, so that detectedcollocations can be validated and thus in-corporated into the glossary.
The posibilityof enriching the glossary with contextualinformation has not yet been implemented,but holds great potentiallity ( <doctype>,<d iv>,  <p> and <s> tags could be usedto locate collocations in context and indexthem through their correspondig id  tag at-tributes).4 Eva luat ionScores of proper name alignment are shown inTable 3 and are very satisfactory.
With regardsto collocations, we expected that those candi-date collocations found in the bilingual glossarywould show high alignment scores, which has106U Spanish I Basque IIN+N A+N A'+NPN(aux) V+etc.N+N A+N N+N+'v+ (aux)Table 4: Correspondence tablebeen the case.
We still do not have definite sti-mations on the performance of collocations notpresent in the glossary.
As we discuss below,we are still sceptic about the results of the cor-respondence table with current version of theBasque lemmatizer.5 DiscussionWe have not yet calculated how many detectedcollocations are included in the glossary, al-though it has become clear that a high pro-portion of these detected collocations have notbeen considered by the translators who createdthe dictionary.
These tend to include only col-locations which have a clear terminological p-pearance.
It is hard to discriminate betweengeneral language collocations and domain spe-cific terminology and this discussion is beyondthe scope of this paper.The correspondence table with Spanish andBasque grammatical patterns i at present prob-lematic.
This is due to the lack of morphologicalinformation i the output of the Basque lemma-tizer.
Basque is an aglutinative language whichhas postpositions and other functional elementsadded as suffixes.
The information such suf-fixes provide is not shown by the lemmatizerand this inevitably hinders the efficiency of thecorrespondence table.
However we are confi-dent that future versions of both the Basqueand Spanish lemmatizers will become closer be-cause they are currently developed within thesame project eam.
When their output becomesmore homogeneous, the efficiency of the corre-spondence table will be greately increased.6 AcknowledgementsThis research is being partially supported bythe Spanish Research Agency, project ITEM,TIC-96-1243-C03-01.
