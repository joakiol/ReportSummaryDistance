Word Segmentation needs change?
From a linguist?s viewZhendong DongResearch Center of Computer& Language Engineering, CASdzd@keenage.comQiang DongCanada Keentime Inc.dongqiang@keenage.comChangling HaoCanada Keentime Inc.support@keenage.comAbstractThe authors propose that we need somechange for the current technology inChinese word segmentation.
We shouldhave separate and different phases in theso-called segmentation.
First of all, weneed to limit segmentation only to thesegmentation of Chinese characters in-stead of the so-called Chinese words.
Incharacter segmentation, we will extractall the information of each character.Then we start a phase called Chinesemorphological processing (CMP).
Thefirst step of CMP is to do a combinationof the separate characters and is then fol-lowed by post-segmentation processing,including all sorts of repetitive structures,Chinese-style abbreviations, recognitionof pseudo-OOVs and their processing,etc.
The most part of post-segmentationprocessing may have to be done by somerule-based sub-routines, thus we needchange the current corpus-based meth-odology by merging with rule-basedtechnique.1 IntroductionChinese word segmentation seems to be an oldgrandma?s story.
We very often hear some con-tradictory remarks about its advance.
Most ofreports from the evaluation tasks always gave uspositive, or even impressive results, such as over96% accuracy, but some reports were rathernegative and expressed their deep concern.
Theyclaimed that word segmentation was still entan-gled in a difficult situation and no breakthroughin real applications.
By careful and longtime ob-servation, the incompetence is usually caused bythe coarseness in the currently prevalent tech-nology.We carefully observed some Chinese-EnglishMT systems and found some errors were causedeven in the very early stage of the processing,that is, in the stage of word segmentation.
Nomatter the MT is statistics-based or rule-based,they have their Achilles' heel in the segmenta-tion stage.
Can today?s prevalent technologyeffectively cope with the problem?
Or do weneed some change?
The present technology ischaracterized by its ?trilogy?, that is, ?corpora +statistics (ML) + evaluation?.
We regret to saythat many researchers today may be indulged inmethodology itself rather than the language theyhave to target.
They are enchanted by the scoresand ranks, but they forget the object they areprocessing.Therefore we propose that a Chinese morpho-logical processing (CMP) should be taken toreplace the current Chinese word segmentation.CMP includes the following components:?
Chinese character processing (CCP)?
Initial combination of Chinese multi-character expressions (CMEs)?
Morphological structure processing(MSP)2 Chinese character processing2.1 ?Word?
in Chinese?Word or no word?
may be an even older storyin Chinese linguistic circle.
One assertion aboutChinese words may be quite popular, even tomost of western researchers in the NLP circle,that is, different from English or other westernlanguages, there is no space between Chinesewords and thus segmentation of a running textinto words is necessary for Chinese processing.However, do words really exist in Chinese?
It isstill a vexing and controversial issue.
SomeChinese grammarians argue that in Chinese thereare no words at all, but there are only charactersinstead and some express their strong objection.What is a Chinese ?word??
It was reportedthat the concept of ?word?
had not been intro-duced into China until the very beginning of thelast century.
In fact word is alien to Chinese.
Atleast the concept of word in Chinese is rathervague.
In Chinese there are no clear-cut distinc-tion between characters and so-called word, ei-ther between multi-character words and thosethat are similar to English MWE.
Ordinary Eng-lish people may be surprised if they are told thateven in popular Chinese dictionaries there are noentries equivalent to English ?pork (??
)?,?beef ??
)?, ?egg (??
)?, ?rain (verb ??
)?,?snow (verb ??
)?, but there are entries equiva-lent to English ?lower limbs(??
)?, ?give or-ders (??
)?, ?appendicitis (???)?.
There issomewhat arbitrariness in recognition of Chinese?words?, so the vocabulary in different Chinesedictionaries may vary very greatly.
Does a dic-tionary take usage frequency into account whenit decides on its entries?
Let?s compare their oc-currence with the following entries in the dic-tionary as shown in Table 1.
Let?s compare theoccurrence with the following entries in differentdictionaries and in reference to Google?s results.In Table 1, ?-?
indicates that the entry does notoccur and ?+?

Comparison of entry occurrence indictionariesIn a word, since ?word?
in Chinese is rathervague, what is a better tactics we should takethen?
The present word segmentation is bur-dened too heavily.
In comparison with Englishtokenization, it goes too far.
Does English to-kenization deal with MWEs, such as ?Unitednations?, ?free of charge?, ?first lady??
Whydoes Chinese word segmentation have to dealwith Chinese multi-character ?word?
?2.2 Chinese character processing (CCP)We propose that the real task of so-called Chi-nese word segmentation is to segment a runningtext into single characters with spaces between.We call this processing Chinese character proc-essing (CCP).
CCP is in parallel with Englishtokenization.
In most cases CCP can achieve100% accuracy.
The most important task forCCP is not only to segment a text, but also toobtain various kinds of information (syntactic,semantic) of every character.
What will be fol-lowed depends on the tasks to be designated.Usually a demand-led morphological processingwill be taken.3 Initial combinationIn most cases, what we called initial combina-tion of Chinese multi-character expressions(CMEs) should be followed indispensably.
Itmay be either shallow or deep, and may be doneeither with the help of a lexical database or acorpus, and the longest matching may be thefrequently-used technique.4 Morphological structure processing(MSP)4.1 Pseudo-OOVsThe first task of MSP is to recognize and processChinese OOVs.
What are OOVs in English?Normally if a string between two spaces in arunning text does not exist in the lexicaldatabase or the corpus the processing system isusing, this string is taken as an OOV.
However,what is an OOV in Chinese then?
It is really notso easy to define an OOV in Chinese as inEnglish.
The recognition of English OOVs maybe done in the phase of tokenization, but therecognition of Chinese OOVs should, in a strictsense, not be done in so-called wordsegmentation.
It should be regarded as a specialphase of the morphological processing.
It iscommonly acknowledged that OOV recognitionis the most serious factor that impairs theperformance of current Chinese wordsegmentation.We may first look at some instances of ma-chine translation results and find the actual prob-lems.
The reason why we use MT systems to testand evaluate segmentation is because this willmake it explicit and easy for human to assess.One error in segmentation makes a 100% failurein translation.
In our examples, the translation (a)is done by a statistical MT system and the trans-lation (b) by a rule-based MT system.
(C) is hu-man translation, which may help make compari-son and find the errors made by MT.1.
??????????
2020?????
(a) Americans even behind the bid to hostthe 2020 Olympic Games in Nanjing.
(b) American people's strength holds outin Nanjing and bids for the 2020 OlympicGames.
(c) Americans fully backed up Nanjing?sbid to host the 2020 Olympic Games.Chinese OOVs can be roughly categorizedinto two classes, one is true OOVs and the otheris pseudo-OOVs.
The recognition and process-ing of true OOVs can be done as English OOVsare treated in English.
However, the recognitionand processing of Chinese pseudo-OOVs shouldbe done by a special processing module.
Chinesepseudo-OOVs includes two types: plain pseudo-OOVs, such as ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ????,???
?, ???
?, and abbreviated pseudo-OOVs,such as ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ?????
?, ????
?, ????
?, ????
?, ????
?, ????
?, ??????.?
Plain pseudo-OOVsA pseudo-OOV is a combinatory string ofChinese characters in which each character car-ries one of its original meanings and the way ofcombination conforms to Chinese grammaticalpattern.
In the above Chinese sentence the word????
is a typical pseudo-OOV.
????
is acombination of two characters, ???
and ???.???
has four meanings, one of which is ?doone?s best?.
???
has six meanings, one of whichis ?back up?.
Originally in Chinese dictionarieswe can find the following expressions similar tothe pattern of ???
?, such as ???
?, ????,???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ???
?, ????.
In allthese expressions the character ???
carries thesame meaning as that in ???
?, and the secondcharacters in the combinations are all actions.Therefore the expression ????
is a grammati-cal and meaningful pseudo-OOV.
It should benoticed that this kind of pseudo-OOV is highlyproductive in Chinese.
In addition to all the dic-tionary entries that we listed above, we found???
(to strongly state)?and ???
(to stronglyresist)?
are already used in the web.
Its highlyoccurrence in real texts calls our special atten-tion.
Let?s see how MT will tackle them poorly.2.
??????????
(a) Chen multiple defense of humandoubt.
(b) Many old doubtful points of the man-power of pleading.
(c) The pleader argued and showed manydoubtful points.We wonder how the current technique ofsegmentation tackles the problem.
We are notsure how one error in a segmentation effect thescore in Bakeoff.Let?s look at two more examples and have abrief discussion of them.3.????????????????????????????
(a) According to neighbors reflected theincident that day at noon there is a fast foodtake-Lang came to the victim's home.
(b) According to the information ofneighbour's, a fast food takes out the mydarling to been to victim's home at noon onthe day when the case happened.
(c) According to the neighbors, at noon onthe same day a fast food takeout boy cameto the victim?s house.4.
????????????
(a) One officer was stabbed to death thewomen pedicure.
(b) An officer is trimmed the foot daughterand assassinated.
(c) An official was stabbed to death by thegirl pedicurist.All the four erroneous MT translations aboveoriginate from the so-called recognition ofOOVs ?????
and ?????
in the segmenta-tion.
The MT systems might make out ???
?and ???
or ????
and ???
separately, butfail to recognize their combinations.
The combi-nation pattern of these two plain pseudo-OOVsis a very typical and popular one in Chinese, justsimilar to the suffix ?-er?
or ?-or?
in English toderive a noun of a doer.
?????
is a combina-tion of ????
(takeout) and ???(boy).
When aMT failed to tackle it, the translation would beso poor.?
Abbreviated pseudo-OOVsDifferent from English abbreviations or acro-nyms, Chinese abbreviations in essence are con-tracted forms of words and expressions.
Thecontraction is mainly related to three factors: (1)maximal preservation of the original meaning; (2)possible maintenance of Chinese grammaticalstructural pattern; (3) consideration of accept-ableness of rhythm.
Let?s take ?????
for ex-ample.
?????
is the contraction of?????????.
The literal translation of theexpression is ?maintain stability office?.
Thusthe first part of the expression ??????
iscontracted to ???
?, and the second part is con-tracted to ???.
??????
grammatically is a?verb + object?
structure while ????
can beregarded as the same grammatical structure.Grammatically ?????
is modified by?????
?, and in the contraction the word???
is also modified by the contraction ???
?.As for acceptableness of rhythm, ?????
is athree-character expression, in which the first twoare a ?verb + object structure and the last is sin-gle.
The structure of ?2-character verb + 1-character noun?
is a highly-productive pattern ofnoun expression in Chinese.
So it is desirable toprocess this type of structures before syntacticprocessing.
As the structure can usually be pat-ternized, it is possible to have them well-processed.
We propose that we should deal withit in the morphological processing stage.4.2 Repetitive structuresFirst let?s look at a MT translation and see whathas happened when a Chinese repetitive struc-ture is ill-processed.5.
??????????
(a) Come see Chuan Chuan, too small.
(b) You come to wear looking, it is toosmall.
(c) Come and try on, it is too small.The above two erroneous MT translations (a)and (b) originate from the failure in dealing witha typical verb structural pattern for expression tourge someone to have a try.
This pattern is:?
?VV ?, its actual meaning is ?have a try?
and?to see if ??.
The literal translation of the above??
?instance ?
?
may be ?put on, put on andlet?s have a look?.
Similarly we can have????
?
(which can be literally translated as?taste, taste, and let?s see?
).Chinese is unique with its various types of re-petitive structures.
They are by no means rarephenomena in real texts.
Any negligence or fail-ure in the processing of repetitive structures willsurely spoil the succedent tasks.
Unfortunatelythis problem has not caught enough attention ofresearchers and developers of word segmenta-tion tools.
Most of neglecters usually leave theproblem to the vocabulary that they collect.Let?s compare the following two groups oftranslations:Group A????????????????????????????
?Group B????????????????????????????
?Group A1You listen carefully, is not where the leakwas.He looked at the stop next to the train.Group B1Carefully you chew a chewing is not amint flavor.He sat down, then back by the by.The English translations of the repetitivestructures in Group A1 are acceptable for the???
??
?structures ?
?
and ?
?
are no doubtin the vocabulary.
And the translations of GroupB are messy enough to show that the repetitivestructures become OOVs and are not well-processed.Generally most of Chinese repetitive struc-tures originate from three word classes:?
Verb repetitive patterns:AA   ?
?, ??
?
?,ABAB  ????
????,?
?A / A  ???
???
,?AA   ???
???,A?
?/?A  ????
???????

Adjective repetitive patterns:AA   ??

Classifier repetitive patterns:AA  ???????

?AA ???
???
???

?A?A ????
????????
, ,?A?
?A  ?????
????
?, ,????
?All these patterns are highly productive inChinese.
It will be impracticable for any Chineseparsing or MT systems to leave all the resolu-tions of them to the vocabulary rather than spe-cial processing module.4.3 Plain classifier and unit structuresChinese is featured by its plenty of classifiers.
Inmany cases a concrete noun occurs idiomaticallywith its particular classifier especially whenmodified a numeral, for example, ?????
(aperson), ?????
(two cars), ???????
(3kilos of apples).
The processing of this type ofstructures will surely benefit the succeedingparsing and even word sense disambiguation.Besides the processing is comparatively easyeven in the early stage.4.4 Chinese verb aspect processingThe verb aspect in Chinese is different from thatin English.
In general, by using Chinese aspects,we add some procedural tune to a verb ratherthan relating to time.
In other words Chineseverb aspects give hints of the developmentalphases or results, or the capability or possibilityof the events.
Chinese verb aspects are expressedby the aspect markers, such as simple markers??
?, ??
?, ??
?, ??
?, ??
?, ??
?, ??
?, ???,???
and compound markers ???
?, ???
?,etc.Again let?s look at two pair of Chinese-to-English MT translations.
(6) ?????????????????????
(a) To dry too much work, a person in-deed dry However come.
(b) The ones that should do have toomuch work, one can not really be dry.
(c) I have too much work to do, I canhardly cope with it.
(7) ???????????
(a) Said the girl spoke to cry.
(b) The girl has cried saying.
(c) The girl began to weep while talking.The messy translations tell us how serious theimpairment of the translation will be if we fail toprocess the Chinese verb aspects.Table 2 shows the meanings conveyed bymost Chinese aspect and its corresponding ?as-pect markers?
and examples.
Finally, whenspeaking about Chinese aspect, one point wewould like to invite readers?
attention that dif-ferent from the aspect of English.
It is knownthat English aspect is usually closely related totenses, for example, English verbs can be used inprogressive aspect with various tenses, such aspresent progressive, progressive and future pro-gressive tenses.
However, Chinese aspects arerelated to the development of the event itself, butnot related to the time when the event happens.5 ConclusionIs it time for Chinese NLP circle to rethink whatwe have actually achieved in the word segmen-tation and consider some radical change?
Howmuch room left is there for the current trilogy toimprove?
We propose that we should have mor-phological processing to replace the so-calledword segmentation.
We have designated newtasks for the processing.
In addition, we hopethat we should design and use a new evaluationmethod.
The general idea of new evaluation is touse a post-segmentation, or post-morphological-processing task, say, chunking, to evaluate,rather than the present method of isochronousself-testing.sememe inHowNet meaning marker examples{Vsuppose|??}
