This paper extends the originalBLANC (?BLANC-gold?
henceforth) tosystem mentions, removing the gold men-tion assumption.
The proposed BLANCfalls back seamlessly to the original one ifsystem mentions are identical to gold men-tions, and it is shown to strongly correlatewith existing metrics on the 2011 and 2012CoNLL data.1 IntroductionCoreference resolution aims at identifying natu-ral language expressions (or mentions) that referto the same entity.
It entails partitioning (oftenimperfect) mentions into equivalence classes.
Acritically important problem is how to measure thequality of a coreference resolution system.
Manyevaluation metrics have been proposed in the pasttwo decades, including the MUC measure (Vilainet al, 1995), B-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998),CEAF (Luo, 2005) and, more recently, BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy, 2011).
B-cubed andCEAF treat entities as sets of mentions and mea-sure the agreement between key (or gold standard)entities and response (or system-generated) enti-ties, while MUC and BLANC-gold are link-based.In particular, MUC measures the degree ofagreement between key coreference links (i.e.,links among mentions within entities) and re-sponse coreference links, while non-coreferencelinks (i.e., links formed by mentions from differententities) are not explicitly taken into account.
Thisleads to a phenomenon where coreference systemsoutputting large entities are scored more favorablythan those outputting small entities (Luo, 2005).BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), on the otherhand, considers both coreference links and non-coreference links.
It calculates recall, precisionand F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and definesthe overall recall, precision and F-measure as themean of the respective measures for coreferenceand non-coreference links.The BLANC-gold metric was developed withthe assumption that response mentions and keymentions are identical.
In reality, however, men-tions need to be detected from natural languagetext and the result is, more often than not, im-perfect: some key mentions may be missing inthe response, and some response mentions may bespurious?so-called ?twinless?
mentions by Stoy-anov et al (2009).
Therefore, the identical-mention-set assumption limits BLANC-gold?s ap-plicability when gold mentions are not available,or when one wants to have a single score mea-suring both the quality of mention detection andcoreference resolution.
The goal of this paper isto extend the BLANC-gold metric to imperfect re-sponse mentions.We first briefly review the original definition ofBLANC, and rewrite its definition using set nota-tion.
We then argue that the gold-mention assump-tion in Recasens and Hovy (2011) can be liftedwithout changing the original definition.
In fact,the proposed BLANC metric subsumes the origi-nal one in that its value is identical to the originalone when response mentions are identical to keymentions.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.We introduce the notions used in this paper inSection 2.
We then present the original BLANC-gold in Section 3 using the set notation defined inSection 2.
This paves the way to generalize it to24imperfect system mentions, which is presented inSection 4.
The proposed BLANC is applied to theCoNLL 2011 and 2012 shared task participants,and the scores and its correlations with existingmetrics are shown in Section 5.2 NotationsTo facilitate the presentation, we define the nota-tions used in the paper.We use key to refer to gold standard mentions orentities, and response to refer to system mentionsor entities.
The collection of key entities is denotedby K = {ki}|K|i=1, where kiis the ithkey entity;accordingly, R = {rj}|R|j=1is the set of responseentities, and rjis the jthresponse entity.
We as-sume that mentions in {ki} and {rj} are unique;in other words, there is no duplicate mention.Let Ck(i) and Cr(j) be the set of coreferencelinks formed by mentions in kiand rj:Ck(i) = {(m1,m2) : m1?
ki,m2?
ki,m16= m2}Cr(j) = {(m1,m2) : m1?
rj,m2?
rj,m16= m2}As can be seen, a link is an undirected edge be-tween two mentions, and it can be equivalentlyrepresented by a pair of mentions.
Note that whenan entity consists of a single mention, its corefer-ence link set is empty.Let Nk(i, j) (i 6= j) be key non-coreferencelinks formed between mentions in kiand thosein kj, and let Nr(i, j) (i 6= j) be response non-coreference links formed between mentions in riand those in rj, respectively:Nk(i, j) = {(m1,m2) : m1?
ki,m2?
kj}Nr(i, j) = {(m1,m2) : m1?
ri,m2?
rj}Note that the non-coreference link set is emptywhen all mentions are in the same entity.We use the same letter and subscription with-out the index in parentheses to denote the union ofsets, e.g.,Ck= ?iCk(i), Nk= ?i 6=jNk(i, j)Cr= ?jCr(j), Nr= ?i6=jNr(i, j)We use Tk= Ck?
Nkand Tr= Cr?
Nrtodenote the total set of key links and total set ofresponse links, respectively.
Clearly, Ckand Nkform a partition of Tksince Ck?
Nk= ?, Tk=Ck?Nk.
Likewise, Crand Nrform a partition ofTr.We say that a key link l1?
Tkequals a responselink l2?
Trif and only if the pair of mentionsfrom which the links are formed are identical.
Wewrite l1= l2if two links are equal.
It is easy tosee that the gold mention assumption?same setof response mentions as the set of key mentions?can be equivalently stated as Tk= Tr(this doesnot necessarily mean that Ck= Cror Nk= Nr).We also use | ?
| to denote the size of a set.3 Original BLANCBLANC-gold is adapted from Rand Index (Rand,1971), a metric for clustering objects.
Rand Indexis defined as the ratio between the number of cor-rect within-cluster links plus the number of correctcross-cluster links, and the total number of links.When Tk= Tr, Rand Index can be applied di-rectly since coreference resolution reduces to aclustering problem where mentions are partitionedinto clusters (entities):Rand Index =|Ck?
Cr|+ |Nk?Nr|12(|Tk|(|Tk| ?
1))(1)In practice, though, the simple-minded adoptionof Rand Index is not satisfactory since the numberof non-coreference links often overwhelms that ofcoreference links (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), or,|Nk|  |Ck| and |Nr|  |Cr|.
Rand Index, ifused without modification, would not be sensitiveto changes of coreference links.BLANC-gold solves this problem by averagingthe F-measure computed over coreference linksand the F-measure over non-coreference links.Using the notations in Section 2, the recall, pre-cision, and F-measure on coreference links are:R(g)c=|Ck?
Cr||Ck?
Cr|+ |Ck?Nr|(2)P(g)c=|Ck?
Cr||Cr?
Ck|+ |Cr?Nk|(3)F(g)c=2R(g)cP(g)cR(g)c+ P(g)c; (4)Similarly, the recall, precision, and F-measure onnon-coreference links are computed as:R(g)n=|Nk?Nr||Nk?
Cr|+ |Nk?Nr|(5)P(g)n=|Nk?Nr||Nr?
Ck|+ |Nr?Nk|(6)F(g)n=2R(g)nP(g)nR(g)n+ P(g)n. (7)25Finally, the BLANC-gold metric is the arithmeticaverage of F(g)cand F(g)n:BLANC(g)=F(g)c+ F(g)n2.
(8)Superscriptgin these equations highlights the factthat they are meant for coreference systems withgold mentions.Eqn.
(8) indicates that BLANC-gold assignsequal weight to F(g)c, the F-measure from coref-erence links, and F(g)n, the F-measure from non-coreference links.
This avoids the problem that|Nk|  |Ck| and |Nr|  |Cr|, should the originalRand Index be used.In Eqn.
(2) - (3) and Eqn.
(5) - (6), denominatorsare written as a sum of disjoint subsets so they canbe related to the contingency table in (Recasensand Hovy, 2011).
Under the assumption that Tk=Tr, it is clear that Ck= (Ck?
Cr) ?
(Ck?Nr),Cr= (Ck?
Cr) ?
(Nk?
Cr), and so on.4 BLANC for Imperfect ResponseMentionsUnder the assumption that the key and responsemention sets are identical (which implies thatTk= Tr), Equations (2) to (7) make sense.
Forexample, Rcis the ratio of the number of correctcoreference links over the number of key corefer-ence links; Pcis the ratio of the number of cor-rect coreference links over the number of responsecoreference links, and so on.However, when response mentions are not iden-tical to key mentions, a key coreference link maynot appear in either Cror Nr, so Equations (2) to(7) cannot be applied directly to systems with im-perfect mentions.
For instance, if the key entitiesare {a,b,c} {d,e}; and the response entitiesare {b,c} {e,f,g}, then the key coreferencelink (a,b) is not seen on the response side; sim-ilarly, it is possible that a response link does notappear on the key side either: (c,f) and (f,g)are not in the key in the above example.To account for missing or spurious links, we ob-serve that?
Ck\ Trare key coreference links missing inthe response;?
Nk\ Trare key non-coreference links miss-ing in the response;?
Cr\ Tkare response coreference links miss-ing in the key;?
Nr\ Tkare response non-coreference linksmissing in the key,and we propose to extend the coreference F-measure and non-coreference F-measure as fol-lows.
Coreference recall, precision and F-measureare changed to:Rc=|Ck?
Cr||Ck?
Cr|+ |Ck?Nr|+ |Ck\ Tr|(9)Pc=|Ck?

Ck|+ |Cr?Nk|+ |Cr\ Tk|(10)Fc=2RcPcRc+ Pc(11)Non-coreference recall, precision and F-measureare changed to:Rn=|Nk?Nr||Nk?
Cr|+ |Nk?Nr|+ |Nk\ Tr|(12)Pn=|Nk?Nr||Nr?
Ck|+ |Nr?Nk|+ |Nr\ Tk|(13)Fn=2RnPnRn+ Pn.
(14)The proposed BLANC continues to be the arith-metic average of Fcand Fn:BLANC =Fc+ Fn2.
(15)We observe that the definition of the proposedBLANC, Equ.
(9)-(14) subsume the BLANC-gold (2) to (7) due to the following proposition:If Tk= Tr, then BLANC = BLANC(g).Proof.
We only need to show that Rc= R(g)c,Pc= P(g)c, Rn= R(g)n, and Pn= P(g)n. We provethe first one (the other proofs are similar and elideddue to space limitations).
Since Tk= TrandCk?
Tk, we have Ck?
Tr; thus Ck\Tr= ?, and|Ck?
Tr| = 0.
This establishes that Rc= R(g)c.Indeed, since Ckis a union of three disjoint sub-sets: Ck= (Ck?
Cr) ?
(Ck?
Nr) ?
(Ck\ Tr),R(g)cand Rccan be unified as|Ck?Cr||CK|.
Unificationfor other component recalls and precisions can bedone similarly.
So the final definition of BLANCcan be succinctly stated as:Rc=|Ck?
Cr||Ck|, Pc=|Ck?
Cr||Cr|(16)Rn=|Nk?Nr||Nk|, Pn=|Nk?Nr||Nr|(17)Fc=2|Ck?
Cr||Ck|+ |Cr|, Fn=2|Nk?Nr||Nk|+ |Nr|(18)BLANC =Fc+ Fn2(19)264.1 Boundary CasesCare has to be taken when counts of the BLANCdefinition are 0.
This can happen when all key(or response) mentions are in one cluster or areall singletons: the former case will lead to Nk= ?
(or Nr= ?
); the latter will lead to Ck= ?
(orCr= ?).
Observe that as long as |Ck|+ |Cr| > 0,Fcin (18) is well-defined; as long as |Nk|+|Nr| >0, Fnin (18) is well-defined.
So we only need toaugment the BLANC definition for the followingcases:(1) If Ck= Cr= ?
and Nk= Nr= ?, thenBLANC = I(Mk= Mr), where I(?)
is an in-dicator function whose value is 1 if its argumentis true, and 0 otherwise.
Mkand Mrare the keyand response mention set.
This can happen when adocument has no more than one mention and thereis no link.
(2) If Ck= Cr= ?
and |Nk| + |Nr| > 0, thenBLANC = Fn.
This is the case where the keyand response side has only entities consisting ofsingleton mentions.
Since there is no coreferencelink, BLANC reduces to the non-coreference F-measure Fn.
(3) If Nk= Nr= ?
and |Ck| + |Cr| > 0, thenBLANC = Fc.
This is the case where all mentionsin the key and response are in one entity.
Sincethere is no non-coreference link, BLANC reducesto the coreference F-measure Fc.4.2 Toy ExamplesWe walk through a few examples and show howBLANC is calculated in detail.
In all the examplesbelow, each lower-case letter represents a mention;mentions in an entity are closed in {}; two lettersin () represent a link.Example 1.
Key entities are {abc} and {d}; re-sponse entities are {bc} and {de}.
Obviously,Ck= {(ab), (bc), (ac)};Nk= {(ad), (bd), (cd)};Cr= {(bc), (de)};Nr= {(bd), (be), (cd), (ce)}.Therefore, Ck?
Cr= {(bc)}, Nk?
Nr={(bd), (cd)}, and Rc=13, Pc=12, Fc=25; Rn=23, Pn=24, Fn=47.
Finally, BLANC =1735.Example 2.
Key entity is {a}; response entityis {b}.
This is boundary case (1): BLANC = 0.Example 3.
Key entities are {a}{b}{c}; re-sponse entities are {a}{b}{d}.
This is boundarycase (2): there are no coreference links.

All values are F1scores.other measures along R, P and F1 (Table 3),showing that BLANC is able to capture mostentity-based similarities measured by B-cubed andCEAF.
However, the CoNLL data sets come fromOntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006), where singletonentities are not annotated, and BLANC has a widerdynamic range on data sets with singletons (Re-casens and Hovy, 2011).
So the correlations willlikely be lower on data sets with singleton entities.6 ConclusionThe original BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy,2011) requires that system mentions be identicalto gold mentions, which limits the metric?s utilitysince detected system mentions often have missingkey mentions or spurious mentions.
The proposedBLANC is free from this assumption, and wehave shown that it subsumes the original BLANC-gold.
Since BLANC works on imperfect systemmentions, we have used it to score the CoNLL2011 and 2012 coreference systems.
The BLANCscores show strong correlation with existing met-rics, especially B-cubed and CEAF-m.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the three anonymous re-viewers for their invaluable suggestions for im-proving the paper.
