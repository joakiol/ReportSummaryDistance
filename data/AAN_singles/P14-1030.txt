Thispaper proposes a novel approach to col-lectively extract them with graph co-ranking.
First, compared to previousmethods which solely employed opinionrelations among words, our method con-structs a heterogeneous graph to modeltwo types of relations, including seman-tic relations and opinion relations.
Next,a co-ranking algorithm is proposed to es-timate the confidence of each candidate,and the candidates with higher confidencewill be extracted as opinion targets/words.In this way, different relations make coop-erative effects on candidates?
confidenceestimation.
Moreover, word preferenceis captured and incorporated into our co-ranking algorithm.
In this way, our co-ranking is personalized and each candi-date?s confidence is only determined by itspreferred collocations.
It helps to improvethe extraction precision.
The experimen-tal results on three data sets with differ-ent sizes and languages show that our ap-proach achieves better performance thanstate-of-the-art methods.1 IntroductionIn opinion mining, extracting opinion targets andopinion words are two fundamental subtasks.Opinion targets are objects about which users?opinions are expressed, and opinion words arewords which indicate opinions?
polarities.
Ex-tracting them can provide essential informationfor obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers?opinions.
Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions(Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al, 2012; Moghaddamand Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).To this end, previous work usually employed acollective extraction strategy (Qiu et al, 2009; Huand Liu, 2004b; Liu et al, 2013b).
Their intuitionis: opinion words usually co-occur with opiniontargets in sentences, and there are strong modifi-cation relationship between them (called opinionrelation in (Liu et al, 2012)).
If a word is anopinion word, other words with which that wordhaving opinion relations will have highly proba-bility to be opinion targets, and vice versa.
In thisway, extraction is alternatively performed and mu-tual reinforced between opinion targets and opin-ion words.
Although this strategy has been widelyemployed by previous approaches, it still has sev-eral limitations.1) Only considering opinion relations is in-sufficient.
Previous methods mainly focused onemploying opinion relations among words foropinion target/word co-extraction.
They have in-vestigated a series of techniques to enhance opin-ion relations identification performance, such asnearest neighbor rules (Liu et al, 2005), syntacticpatterns (Zhang et al, 2010; Popescu and Etzioni,2005), word alignment models (Liu et al, 2012;Liu et al, 2013b; Liu et al, 2013a), etc.
How-ever, we are curious that whether merely employ-ing opinion relations among words is enough foropinion target/word extraction?
We note that thereare additional types of relations among words.
Forexample, ?LCD?
and ?LED?
both denote the sameaspect ?screen?
in TV set domain, and they aretopical related.
We call such relations betweenhomogeneous words as semantic relations.
If wehave known ?LCD?
to be an opinion target, ?LED?is naturally to be an opinion target.
Intuitively,besides opinion relations, semantic relations mayprovide additional rich clues for indicating opin-ion targets/words.
Which kind of relations is moreeffective for opinion targets/words extraction?
Is itbeneficial to consider these two types of relationstogether for the extraction?
To our best knowl-314edge, these problems have seldom been studiedbefore (see Section 2).2) Ignoring word preference.
When employ-ing opinion relations to perform mutual reinforc-ing extraction between opinion targets and opin-ion words, previous methods depended on opin-ion associations among words, but seldom consid-ered word preference.
Word preference denotesa word?s preferred collocations.
Intuitively, theconfidence of a candidate being an opinion tar-get (opinion word) should mostly be determinedby its word preferences rather than all words hav-ing opinion relations with it.
For example?This camera?s price is expensive for me.?
?It?s price is good.?
?Canon 40D has a good price.
?In these three sentences, ?price?
is modified by?good?
more times than ?expensive?.
In tradi-tional extraction strategy, opinion associations areusually computed based on the co-occurrence fre-quency.
Thus, ?good?
has more strong opinionassociation with ?price?
than ?expensive?, and itwould have more contributions on determining?price?
to be an opinion target or not.
It?s un-reasonable.
?Expensive?
actually has more re-latedness with ?price?
than ?good?, and ?expen-sive?
is likely to be a word preference for ?price?.The confidence of ?price?
being an opinion targetshould be influenced by ?expensive?
in greater ex-tent than ?good?.
In this way, we argue that theextraction will be more precise.???

?Figure 1: Heterogeneous Graph: OC means opin-ion word candidates.
TC means opinion targetcandidates.
Solid curves and dotted lines respec-tively mean semantic relations and opinion rela-tions between two candidates.Thus, to resolve these two problems, we presenta novel approach with graph co-ranking.
The col-lective extraction of opinion targets/words is per-formed in a co-ranking process.
First, we oper-ate over a heterogeneous graph to model seman-tic relations and opinion relations into a unifiedmodel.
Specifically, our heterogeneous graph iscomposed of three subgraphs which model differ-ent relation types and candidates, as shown in Fig-ure 1.
The first subgraph Gttrepresents semanticrelations among opinion target candidates, and thesecond subgraph Goomodels semantic relationsamong opinion word candidates.
The third partis a bipartite subgraph Gto, which models opinionrelations among different candidate types and con-nects the above two subgraphs together.
Then weperform a random walk algorithm onGtt, GooandGtoseparately, to estimate all candidates?
confi-dence, and the entries with higher confidence thana threshold are correspondingly extracted as opin-ion targets/words.
The results could reflect whichtype of relation is more useful for the extraction.Second, a co-ranking algorithm, which incor-porates three separate random walks on Gtt, Gooand Gtointo a unified process, is proposed toperform candidate confidence estimation.
Differ-ent relations may cooperatively affect candidateconfidence estimation and generate more globalranking results.
Moreover, we discover each can-didate?s preferences through topics.
Such wordpreference will be different for different candi-dates.
We add word preference information intoour algorithm and make our co-ranking algorithmbe personalized.
A candidate?s confidence wouldmainly absorb the contributions from its wordpreferences rather than its all neighbors with opin-ion relations, which may be beneficial for improv-ing extraction precision.We perform experiments on real-world datasetsfrom different languages and different domains.Results show that our approach effectively im-proves extraction performance compared to thestate-of-the-art approaches.2 Related WorkThere are many significant research efforts onopinion targets/words extraction (sentence leveland corpus level).
In sentence level extraction,previous methods (Wu et al, 2009; Ma and Wan,2010; Li et al, 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013)mainly aimed to identify all opinion target/wordmentions in sentences.
They regarded it as a se-quence labeling task, where several classical mod-els were used, such as CRFs (Li et al, 2010) andSVM (Wu et al, 2009).This paper belongs to corpus level extraction,and aims to generate a sentiment lexicon and atarget list rather than to identify mentions in sen-315tences.
Most of previous corpus-level methodsadopted a co-extraction framework, where opin-ion targets and opinion words reinforce each otheraccording to their opinion relations.
Thus, howto improve opinion relations identification perfor-mance was their main focus.
(Hu and Liu, 2004a)exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinionrelations among words.
(Popescu and Etzioni,2005) and (Qiu et al, 2011) designed syntacticpatterns to perform this task.
(Zhang et al, 2010)promoted Qiu?s method.
They adopted some spe-cial designed patterns to increase recall.
(Liu etal., 2012; Liu et al, 2013a; Liu et al, 2013b) em-ployed word alignment model to capture opinionrelations rather than syntactic parsing.
The exper-imental results showed that these alignment-basedmethods are more effective than syntax-based ap-proaches for online informal texts.
However, allaforementioned methods only employed opinionrelations for the extraction, but ignore consider-ing semantic relations among homogeneous can-didates.
Moreover, they all ignored word prefer-ence in the extraction process.In terms of considering semantic relationsamong words, our method is related with sev-eral approaches based on topic model (Zhao etal., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Moghad-dam and Ester, 2012a; Moghaddam and Ester,2012b; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).
The maingoals of these methods weren?t to extract opin-ion targets/words, but to categorize all given as-pect terms and sentiment words.
Although thesemodels could be used for our task according to theassociations between candidates and topics, solelyemploying semantic relations is still one-sided andinsufficient to obtain expected performance.Furthermore, there is little work which consid-ered these two types of relations globally (Su etal., 2008; Hai et al, 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013).They usually captured different relations using co-occurrence information.
That was too coarse toobtain expected results (Liu et al, 2012).
In ad-dition, (Hai et al, 2012) extracted opinion tar-gets/words in a bootstrapping process, which hadan error propagation problem.
In contrast, we per-form extraction with a global graph co-rankingprocess, where error propagation can be effec-tively alleviated.
(Su et al, 2008) used heteroge-neous relations to find implicit sentiment associ-ations among words.
Their aim was only to per-form aspect terms categorization but not to extractopinion targets/words.
They extracted opinion tar-gets/words in advanced through simple phrase de-tection.
Thus, the extraction performance is farfrom expectation.3 The Proposed MethodIn this section, we propose our method in detail.We formulate opinion targets/words extraction asa co-ranking task.
All nouns/noun phrases are re-garded as opinion target candidates, and all ad-jectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candi-dates, which are widely adopted by pervious meth-ods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al, 2011; Wangand Wang, 2008; Liu et al, 2012).
Then each can-didate will be assigned a confidence and ranked,and the candidates with higher confidence than athreshold will be extracted as the results.Different from traditional methods, besidesopinion relations among words, we additionallycapture semantic relations among homogeneouscandidates.
To this end, a heterogeneous undi-rected graph G = (V,E) is constructed.
V =Vt?
Vodenotes the vertex set, which includesopinion target candidates vt?

Most previous methods (Hu andLiu, 2004a; Qiu et al, 2011; Wang and Wang,2008; Liu et al, 2012) only considered opinionrelations among words.
Their basic assumption isas follows.Assumption 1: If a word is likely tobe an opinion word, the words whichit has opinion relation with will havehigher confidence to be opinion targets,and vice versa.316In this way, candidates?
confidences (vtor vo) arecollectively determined by each other iteratively.It equals to making random walk on subgraphGto= (V,Eto) of G. Thus we haveCt= (1?

Io(1)where Ctand Corespectively represent confi-dences of opinion targets and opinion words.mtoi,j?Mtomeans the association weight betweenthe ith opinion target and the jth opinion word ac-cording to their opinion relations.It?s worthy noting that Itand Iorespectively de-note prior confidences of opinion target candidatesand opinion word candidates.
We argue that opin-ion targets are usually domain-specific, and thereare remarkably distribution difference of them ondifferent domains (in-domain Dinvs.
out-domainDout).
If a candidate is salient inDinbut commonin Dout, it?s likely to be an opinion target in Din.Thus, we use a domain relevance measure (DR)(Hai et al, 2013) to compute It.DR(t) =R(t,Din)R(t,Dout)(2)where R(t,D) =w?tst??Nj=1(wtj?1Wj?
?Wjk=1wkj) represents candidate relevance withdomain D. wtj= (1 + logTFtj) ?
logNDFtis a TF-IDF-like weight of candidate t in doc-ument j. TFtjis the frequency of the candi-date t in the jth document, and DFtis docu-ment frequency.
N means the document num-ber in domain D. R(t,D) includes two mea-sures to reflect the salient of a candidate in D.
1)wtj?1Wj?
?Wjk=1wkjreflects how frequently aterm is mentioned in a particular document.
Wjdenotes the word number in document j.
2)w?tstquantifies how significantly a term is mentionedacross all documents in D.
w?t=1N?
?Nk=1wtkdenotes average weight across all documents fort.
st=?1N??Nj=1(wtj?
w?j)2denotes thestandard variance of term t. We use the givenreviews as in-domain collection Dinand Googlen-gram corpus1as out-domain collection Dout.Finally, each entry in Itis a normalized DR(t)score.
In contrast, opinion words are usuallydomain-independent.
Users may use same wordsto express theirs opinions, like ?good?, ?bad?, etc.But there are still some domain-dependent opinion1http://books.google.com/ngrams/datasetswords, like ?delicious?
in the restaurant domain,?powerful?
in the car domain.
It?s difficult to dis-criminate them from other words by using statisti-cal information.
So we simply set al entries in Ioto be 1. ?

confidences by only con-sidering semantic relations among words, wemake two separately random walks on the sub-graphs of G, Gtt= (V,Ett) and Goo= (V,Eoo).The basic assumption is as follows:Assumption 2: If a word is likely tobe an opinion target (opinion word), thewords which it has strong semantic rela-tion with will have higher confidence tobe opinion targets (opinion words).In this way, the confidence of the candidate isdetermined only by its homogeneous neighbours.There is no mutual reinforcement between opiniontargets and opinion words.

Here, Assumption 1 and As-sumption 2 are both satisfied.
Thus, an opiniontarget/word candidate?s confidence is collectivelydetermined by its neighbours according to differ-ent relation types.
Meanwhile, each item maymake influence on it?s neighbours.
It?s an iterativereinforcement process.

Our algorithm will run iteratively until itconverges or in a fixed iteration number Iter.
Inexperiments, we set Iter = 200.Obtaining Word Preference.
The co-rankingalgorithm in Eq.4 is based on a standard randomwalking algorithm, which randomly selects a linkaccording to the association matrix Mto, MttandMoo, or jumps to a random node with prior confi-dence value.
However, it generates a global rank-ing over all candidates without taking the nodepreference (word preference) into account.
Asmentioned in the first section, each opinion tar-get/word has its preferred collocations, it?s reason-able that the confidence of an opinion target (opin-ion word) candidate should be preferentially de-termined by its preferences, rather than all of itsneighbors with opinion relations.To obtain the word preference, we resort to top-ics.
We believe that if an opinion word vioistopical related with a target word vjt, viocan beregarded as a word preference for vjt, and viceversa.
For example, ?price?
and ?expensive?
aretopically related in phone?s domain, so they are aword preference for each other.Specifically, we use a vector PTi=[PTi1, ..., PTik, ..., PTi|Vo|]1?|Vo|to represent wordpreference of the ith opinion target candidate.PTikmeans the preferred probability of the ithpotential opinion target for the kth potentialopinion words.
To compute PTik, we first useKullback-Leibler divergence to measure thesemantic distance between any two candidates onthe bridge of topics.
Thus, we haveD(vi, vj) =12?z(KLz(vi||vj) +KLz(vj||vi))whereKLz(vi||vj) = p(z|vi)logp(z|vi)p(z|vj)means theKL-divergence from candidate vito vjbased ontopic z. p(z|v) = p(v|z)p(z)p(v), where p(v|z) is theprobability of the candidate v to topic z (see Sec-tion 3.4).
p(z) is the probability that topic z inreviews.
p(v) is the probability that a candidateoccurs in reviews.
Then, a logistic function is usedto map D(vi, vj) into [0, 1].SA(vi, vj) =11 + eD(vi,vj)(5)Then, we calculate PTikby normalize SA(vi, vj)score, i.e.
PTik=SA(vti,vok)?|Vo|p=1SA(vti,vop).
For demon-stration, we give some examples in Table 1, whereeach entry denotes a SA(vi, vj) score between twocandidates.
We can see that using topics can suc-cessfully capture the preference information foreach opinion target/word.expensive good long colorfulprice 0.265 0.043 0.003 0.000LED 0.002 0.035 0.007 0.098battery 0.000 0.015 0.159 0.001Table 1: Examples of Calculated Word PreferenceAnd we use a vector POj=[POj1, ..., POjq, ..., POj|Vt|]1?|Vt|to representthe preference information of the jth opin-ion word candidate.
Similarly, we havePOjq=SA(vtq,voj)?|Vt|k=1SA(vtk,voj).Incorporating Word Preference into Co-ranking.
To consider such word preference inour co-ranking algorithm, we incorporate it intothe random walking on Gto.
Intuitively, prefer-ence vectors will be different for different can-didates.
Thus, the co-ranking algorithm wouldbe personalized.
It allows that the candidateconfidence propagates to other candidates onlyin its preference cluster.
Specifically, we makemodification on original transition matrix Mto=(Mto1,Mto2, ...,Mto|Vt|) and add each candidate?spreference in it.
Let?Mto= (?Mto1,?Mto2, ...,?Mto|Vt|)be the modified transition matrix, which recordsthe associations between opinion target candi-dates and opinion word candidates.
Here Mtok?R1?|Vo|and?Mtok?
R1?|Vo|denotes the kth col-umn vector in Mtoand?Mto, respectively.
Andlet Diag(PTk) denote a diagonal matrix whoseeigenvalue is vector PTk, we have?Mtok= MtokDiag(PTk)Similarly, let Utok?
R1?|Vt|and?Utok?
R1?|Vt|denotes the kth row vector in MTtoand?MTto, re-spectively.
Diag(POk) denote a diagonal matrixwhose eigenvalue is vector POk.
Then we have?Utok= UtokDiag(POk)In this way, each candidate?s preference is in-corporated into original associations based onopinion relation Mtothrough Diag(POk) andDiag(PTk).
And candidates?

Io(6)3.4 Capturing Semantic and OpinionRelationsIn this section, we explain how to capture seman-tic relations and opinion relations for constructingtransition matrices Mtt, Mooand Mto.Capturing Semantic Relations: For captur-ing semantic relations among homogenous candi-dates, we employ topics.
We believe that if twocandidates share similar topics in the corpus, thereis a strong semantic relation between them.
Thus,we employ a LDA variation (Mukherjee and Liu,2012), an extension of (Zhao et al, 2010), to dis-cover topic distribution on words, which sampledall words into two separated observations: opiniontargets and opinion words.
It?s because that we areonly interested in topic distribution of opinion tar-gets/words, regardless of other useless words, in-cluding conjunctions, prepositions etc.
This modelhas been proven to be better than the standardLDA model and other LDA variations for opinionmining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).After topic modeling, we obtain the proba-bility of the candidates (vtand vo) to topic z,i.e.
p(z|vt) and p(z|vo), and topic distributionp(z).
Then, a symmetric Kullback-Leibler diver-gence as same as Eq.5 is used to calculate the se-mantical associations between any two homoge-nous candidates.
Thus, we obtain SA(vt, vt) andSA(vo, vo), which correspond to the entries inMttand Moo, respectively.Capturing Opinion Relations: To captureopinion relations among words and construct thetransition matrix Mto, we used an alignment-based method proposed in (Liu et al, 2013b).This approach models capturing opinion relationsas a monolingual word alignment process.
Eachopinion target can find its corresponding mod-ifiers in sentences through alignment, in whichmultiple factors are considered globally, such asco-occurrence information, word position in sen-tence, etc.
Moreover, this model adopted a par-tially supervised framework to combine syntac-tic information with alignment results, which hasbeen proven to be more precise than the state-of-the-art approaches for opinion relations identifica-tion (Liu et al, 2013b).After performing word alignment, we obtaina set of word pairs composed of a noun (nounphrase) and its corresponding modified word.Then, we simply employ Pointwise Mutual Infor-mation (PMI) to calculate the opinion associationsamong words as the entries in Mto.
OA(vt, vo) =logp(vt,vo)p(vt)p(vo), where vtand vodenote an opiniontarget candidate and an opinion word candidate,respectively.
p(vt, vo) is the co-occurrence prob-ability of vtand vobased on the opinion relationidentification results.
p(vt) and p(vo) give the in-dependent occurrence probability of of vtand vo,respectively4 Experiments4.1 Datasets and Evaluation MetricsDatasets: To evaluate the proposed method, weused three datasets.
The first one is CustomerReview Datasets (CRD), used in (Hu and Liu,2004a), which contains reviews about five prod-ucts.
The second one is COAE2008 dataset22,which contains Chinese reviews about four prod-ucts.
The third one is Large, also used in (Wanget al, 2011; Liu et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2013a),where two domains are selected (Mp3 and Hotel).As mentioned in (Liu et al, 2012), Large con-tains 6,000 sentences for each domain.
Opiniontargets/words are manually annotated, where threeannotators were involved.
Two annotators wererequired to annotate out opinion words/targets inreviews.
When conflicts occur, the third annota-tor make final judgement.
In total, we respectivelyobtain 1,112, 1,241 opinion targets and 334, 407opinion words in Hotel, MP3.Pre-processing: All sentences are tagged toobtain words?
part-of-speech tags using StanfordNLP tool3.

Then a HITS (Klein-berg, 1999) algorithm is employed to extract opin-ion targets.Liu is proposed by (Liu et al, 2013a), an ex-tension of (Liu et al, 2012).
They employed aword alignment model to capture opinion relationsamong words, and then used a random walking al-gorithm to extract opinion targets.Hai is proposed by (Hai et al, 2012), which issimilar to our method.
They employed both of se-mantic relations and opinion relations to extractopinion words/targets in a bootstrapping frame-work.
But they captured relations only using co-occurrence statistics.
Moreover, word preferencewas not considered.SAS is proposed by (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012),an extended lda-based model of (Zhao et al,2010).
The top K items for each aspect are ex-tracted as opinion targets/words.
It means thatonly semantic relations among words are consid-ered in SAS.
And we set aspects number to be 9 assame as (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).CR: is the proposed method in this paper by us-ing co-ranking, referring to Eq.4.
CR doesn?t con-sider word preference.CR WP: is the full implementation of ourmethod, referring to Eq.6.Hu, DP, Zhang and Liu are the methods whichonly consider opinion relations among words.SAS is the methods which only consider seman-tic relations among words.
Hai, CR and CR WPconsider these two types of relations together.
Theparameter settings of state-of-the-art methods aresame as their original paper.
In CR and CR WP,we set ?
= 0.4 and ?
= 0.1.
The experimentalresults are shown in Table 2, 3, 4 and 5, where thelast column presents the average F-measure scoresfor multiple domains.
Since Liu and Zhang aren?tdesigned for opinion words extraction, we don?tpresent their results in Table 4 and 5.
From exper-imental results, we can see.1) Our methods (CR and CR WP) outperformother methods not only on opinion targets extrac-tion but on opinion words extraction in most do-mains.
It proves the effectiveness of the proposedmethod.2) CR and CR WP have much better perfor-mance than Liu and Zhang, especially on Recall.Liu and Zhang also use a ranking framework likeours, but they only employ opinion relations forextraction.
In contrast, besides opinion relations,CR and CR WP further take semantic relationsinto account.
Thus, more opinion targets/wordscan be extracted.
Furthermore, we observe thatCR and CR WP outperform SAS.
SAS only ex-ploits semantic relations, but ignores opinion re-lations among words.
Its extraction is performedseparately and neglects the reinforcement betweenopinion targets and opinion words.
Thus, SAS hasworse performance than our methods.
It demon-strates the usefulness of considering multiple rela-tion types.320MethodsD1 D2 D3 D4 D5 Avg.P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F FHu 0.57 0.75 0.65 0.51 0.76 0.61 0.57 0.73 0.64 0.54 0.62 0.58 0.62 0.67 0.64 0.624DP 0.64 0.73 0.68 0.57 0.79 0.66 0.65 0.70 0.67 0.61 0.65 0.63 0.70 0.68 0.69 0.666SAS 0.64 0.68 0.66 0.55 0.70 0.62 0.62 0.65 0.63 0.60 0.61 0.60 0.68 0.63 0.65 0.632Hai 0.62 0.77 0.69 0.52 0.80 0.64 0.60 0.74 0.67 0.56 0.69 0.62 0.66 0.70 0.68 0.660CR 0.62 0.75 0.68 0.57 0.79 0.67 0.64 0.75 0.69 0.63 0.69 0.66 0.68 0.69 0.69 0.678CR WP 0.65 0.75 0.70 0.59 0.80 0.68 0.65 0.74 0.70 0.66 0.68 0.67 0.71 0.70 0.70 0.690Table 4: Results of Opinion Words Extraction on Customer Review DatasetMethodsCamera Car Laptop Phone Mp3 Hotel Avg.P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F FHu 0.72 0.74 0.73 0.70 0.71 0.70 0.66 0.70 0.68 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.48 0.67 0.56 0.52 0.69 0.59 0.660DP 0.80 0.73 0.76 0.79 0.71 0.75 0.75 0.69 0.72 0.78 0.68 0.73 0.60 0.65 0.62 0.61 0.66 0.63 0.702SAS 0.73 0.70 0.71 0.75 0.68 0.71 0.72 0.68 0.69 0.71 0.66 0.68 0.64 0.62 0.63 0.66 0.61 0.63 0.675Hai 0.76 0.74 0.75 0.72 0.74 0.73 0.69 0.72 0.70 0.72 0.70 0.71 0.61 0.69 0.64 0.59 0.68 0.64 0.690CR 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.77 0.74 0.75 0.73 0.71 0.72 0.75 0.71 0.73 0.63 0.69 0.64 0.63 0.68 0.66 0.710CR WP 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.80 0.74 0.77 0.77 0.71 0.74 0.78 0.72 0.75 0.66 0.68 0.67 0.67 0.69 0.68 0.730Table 5: Results of Opinion Words Extraction on COAE 2008 and Large3) CR and CR WP both outperform Hai.
Webelieve the reasons are as follows.
First, CR andCR WP considers multiple relations in a unifiedprocess by using graph co-ranking.
In contrast,Hai adopts a bootstrapping framework which per-forms extraction step by step and may have theproblem of error propagation.
It demonstratesthat our graph co-ranking is more suitable for thistask than bootstrapping-based strategy.
Second,our method captures semantic relations using topicmodeling and captures opinion relations throughword alignments, which are more precise than Haiwhich merely uses co-occurrence information toindicate such relations among words.
In addition,word preference is not handled in Hai, but pro-cessed in CR WP.
The results show the usefulnessof word preference for opinion targets/words ex-traction.4) CR WP outperforms CR, especially on pre-cision.
The only difference between them is thatCR WP considers word preference when perform-ing graph ranking for candidate confidence esti-mation, but CR does not.
Each candidate confi-dence estimation in CR WP gives more weightsfor this candidate?s preferred words than CR.Thus, the precision can be improved.4.3 Semantic Relation vs. Opinion RelationIn this section, we discuss which relation typeis more effective for this task.
For comparison,we design two baselines, called OnlySA and On-lyOA.
OnlyOA only employs opinion relationsamong words, which equals to Eq.1.
OnlySA onlyemploys semantic relations among words, whichequals to Eq.3.
Moreover, Combine is our methodwhich considers both of opinion relations and se-mantic relations together, referring to Eq.4 withMP3 Hotel Laptop PhoneRecall.65.70.75.80.85.90.95OnlySAOnlyOACombine(a) Opinion Target Extraction ResultsMP3 Hotel Laptop PhoneRecall.60.65.70.75.80OnlySAOnlyOACombine(b) Opinion Word Extraction ResultsFigure 2: Semantic Relations vs. Opinion Rela-tions?

Figure 2 presents experimental results.The left graph presents opinion targets extractionresults and the right graph presents opinion wordsextraction results.
Because of space limitation, weonly shown the results of four domains (MP3, Ho-tel, Laptop and Phone).From results, we observe that OnlyOA outper-forms OnlySA in all domains.
It demonstratesthat employing opinion relations are more usefulthan semantic relations for co-extracting opiniontargets/words.
And it is necessary to utilize themutual reinforcement relationship between opin-ion words and opinion targets.
Moreover, Com-bine outperforms OnlySA and OnlyOA in all do-mains.
It indicates that combining different rela-tions among words together is effective.4.4 The Effectiveness of Considering WordPreferenceIn this section, we try to prove the necessity ofconsidering word preference in Eq.6.
Besides thecomparison between CR and CR WP performed321in the main experiment in Section 4.2, we fur-ther incorporate word preference in aforemen-tioned OnlyOA, named as OnlyOA WP, whichonly employs opinion relations among words andequals to Eq.6 with ?
= 0.
Experimental resultsare shown in Figure 3.
Because of space limita-tion, we only show the results of the same domainsin section 4.3,Form results, we observe that CR WP out-performs CR, and OnlyOA WP outperforms On-lyOA in all domains, especially on precision.These observations demonstrate that consideringword preference is very important for opinion tar-gets/words extraction.
We believe the reason isthat exploiting word preference can provide morefine information for opinion target/word candi-dates?
confidence estimation.
Thus the perfor-mance can be improved.MP3 Hotel Laptop PhonePrecision.60.65.70.75.80.85.90OnlyOAOnlyOA_WPCRCR_WPMP3 Hotel Laptop PhoneRecall.70.75.80.85.90.95OnlyOAOnlyOA_WPCRCR_WP(a) Opinion Target Extraction ResultsMP3 Hotel Laptop PhonePrecision.60.65.70.75.80OnlyOAOnlyOA_WPCRCR_WPMP3 Hotel Laptop PhoneRecall.60.657.75.80OnlyOAOnlyOA_WPCRCR_WP(b) Opinion Word Extraction ResultsFigure 3: Experimental results when consideringword preference4.5 Parameter SensitivityIn this subsection, we discuss the variation of ex-traction performance when changing ?
and ?
inEq.6.
Due to space limitation, we only show theF-measure of CR WP on four domains.
Experi-mental results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure5.
The left graphs in Figure 4 and 5 present theperformance variation of CR WP with varying ?from 0 to 0.9 and fixing ?
= 0.1.
The right graphsin Figure 4 and 5 present the performance varia-tion of CR WP with varying ?
from 0 to 0.6 andfixing ?
= 0.4.In the left graphs in Figure 4 and 5, we observethe best performance is obtained when ?
= 0.4.It indicates that opinion relations and semantic re-lations are both useful for extracting opinion tar-gets/words.
The extraction performance is benefi-cial from their combination.
In the right graphs inFigure 4 and 5, the best performance is obtainedwhen ?
= 0.1.
It indicates prior knowledge isuseful for extraction.
When ?
increases, perfor-mance, however, decreases.
It demonstrates thatincorporating more prior knowledge into our al-gorithm would restrain other useful clues on esti-mating candidate confidence, and hurt the perfor-mance.0.0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9F-Measure.60.65.70.75.80.85MP3HotelLaptopPhone0.0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6F-Measure.65.70.75.80.85MP3HotelLaptopPhoneFigure 4: Opinion targets extraction results0.0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9F-Measure.55.60.65.70.75.80MP3HotelLaptopPhone0.0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6F-Measure.50.55.60.65.70.75.80MP3HotelLaptopPhoneFigure 5: Opinion words extraction results5 ConclusionsThis paper presents a novel method with graph co-ranking to co-extract opinion targets/words.
Wemodel extracting opinion targets/words as a co-ranking process, where multiple heterogenous re-lations are modeled in a unified model to make co-operative effects on the extraction.
In addition, weespecially consider word preference in co-rankingprocess to perform more precise extraction.
Com-pared to the state-of-the-art methods, experimentalresults prove the effectiveness of our method.AcknowledgementThis work was sponsored by the NationalBasic Research Program of China (No.2014CB340500), the National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China (No.
