Thishand-crafted atabase results tTrom a multi-disciplinary effort involving technical writers,translators, terminologists and engineers.
Inits current state, the database contains 12,267French/English term ctmt)les, structured in 70semantic ategories.
As already ot)served in sev-eral terminological databases, multi-word termscover the larger part; of the database (nearly80%).
Tile described terms are mostly nounsbut the database also contains about 200 verbsand verbal phrases.
Table 1 gives some exam-pies of terms and a short description of the as-sociated categories.
These linguistic resourcesare integrated in a computer-aided translationenvironment used by technical writers.Semantic ategories have originally been intro-duced in order to distinguish the various sensesof polysemous terms.
Each term couple is an-notated with one or more categories pecifyingthe contexts in which the translation is rec-ommended.
An entry is associated to a ternrfor each identified meaning.
For example, thefrench term ddpasscmerd has at least two pos-sible meanings, corresponding to two differenttranslations: ovc~iflow in the Data Processingcategory (DPR,) and out-o\[-./lushnc.ss in the Air-m'M't Structure category (STR).
As shown in theexamples of table 1, the assigmnent of seman-tic categories has been extended to monosemousterms.In our experiments of term categorization, onlythe fl:ench l;erms have 1)een used.3 Related  Work~brm Semantic Ca, teg'orizat, ion is on several as-pects similar to _Th(;sam'us l~2xtension (Uramoto,1996; Tokunaga et al, 1997).
Our methodsare ch)se to those used for positioning unknownwords in thesauri.
However, the two issues cm~be ditlhrentiated with respect to the manit)u-lated data.
A thesaurus is intended to covera large set; of concet)tual domains while a ter-minological database is tbcused accurately on aspecific topic and its related domains.
For ex-ample, in (Tokunaga et al~ 1997), the thesaurusto be extended contains lnore than 500 cate-gories.
This tends to make the t)roblem harder,lint, since many categories are strictly indepen-dent, it is easier to find distinctive tieatures be-tween categories.
By contrast, our terminolog-ical database contains only 70 categories.
But,in this restricted set, we find categories corre-sponding to close or even overlapping knowledgeareas.

%'aining and test stagesare the following:?
POS tagging.
The test and training cor-pora are tagged with MultAna, a tagger de-signed as an extension of the Multex mor-phological analyzer (Petitpierre and Rus-sell, 1995).

Ext ract ion  of  contextua l  cues.
Foreach term occurrence in training and testdata, the contextual cues are collected.Only the lemmas of open-class words areused and cues may correspond to multi-word terms.
Each test term is then repre-sented by the set of cues which have beencollected in test data.

Figure 1gives; some examples of exogencous catego-rization 3.5 Endogeneous CategorizationOur approach to endogeneous categorization issimpler.
It is exclusively based oll a quantitativeanalysis of the lexical composition of technicalterms.
Henceforth, the open-class words usedto compose technical terms will be called ter-minolwical components.
The endogeneous ap-proach relies on a much more restricted sourceof data than the exogeneous approach, since thecomI)one:nt set of a terminological database isquantitatively limited compared with the set ofcontextual cues extracted from corpora.
Never-theless, we make the assumption that this quan-titative limitation is partly compensated by theaSome category labels are described in table 1.148ARRarchi(;e(:(;ure (architecture)('.nca(lr(;nmnt (fi'aming)(foa,,,,,)cal)otage (fairin.q)chSssis (rack)51astique (elastic)cloison (bulkhead)(;s(:mnol;abl(; retractable)suspension (shock mount)ventilation (ventilation)8.4408.44073317.4457.3537.0206.6326.4416.2666.11<1:MAPfimderie (eastin,9)1)la(:age (claddin.q)school)age (schoop p~veess)dral)age (layup)(:uisson (baking)mouh: ( mo'uld)(:ompact;er (to compact)t)roche (pin)chimique (chemical)usinage (milling)7.9107.8727.2327.1.116.9126.8386.5916.5916.1346.101T~dlle 2: The to t) tell lllos(; significant crnfinological corot)one.his of (:ategories AR.R (Arra.ngemcnt)and MAP (Mmmthcl, uril~g l)roc(;.,~scs).strong discrimination pow(;r of tel"minologi(:alCOml/onen(;s.Th(: training t)hase assigns to each category aset of ret)resenl;ative (:onq)onents with resl)e(:tto some association score.

This corpus covered 63 of the 70categories.
Each run starts with the selectione ta  document among the corpus documents.The known terms identified in this documentare considered as test: terms.
We used rela-tively wide contexts.
The cues were extractedin a window of :t=20 words around the term.Each run involved more than 70,000 contextsof term occurrences.
To experiment he endo-geneous apI)roach, test sets of col~xl)ound termshave l)een randomly extracted from the, terlni-nological database.We adopted an evaluation scheme similar tothat detlned in (Tokunaga et al, 1997) for the-saux'us extension.
The categorization is con-sidered successful if' the right categox'y appearsamong the t~: first categories assigned by theclassifier.
Within a semi-automatic acquisitionframework, this evaluation scheme is more suit-able than strict evaluation where only the firstcategory assigned by the classifier is consid-ered as relevant (evaluation restricted to h=l.)
