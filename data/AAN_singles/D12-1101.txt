Increasingly, practitioners are using mod-els with more complex structure?higher tree-width, larger fan-out, more features, and moredata?rendering even approximate inferencemethods such as MCMC inefficient.
In thispaper we propose an alternative MCMC sam-pling scheme in which transition probabilitiesare approximated by sampling from the setof relevant factors.
We demonstrate that ourmethod converges more quickly than a tradi-tional MCMC sampler for both marginal andMAP inference.
In an author coreference taskwith over 5 million mentions, we achieve a 13times speedup over regular MCMC inference.1 IntroductionConditional random fields and other graphical mod-els are at the forefront of many natural languageprocessing (NLP) and information extraction (IE)tasks because they provide a framework for discrim-inative modeling while succinctly representing de-pendencies among many related output variables.Previously, most applications of graphical modelswere limited to structures where exact inference ispossible, for example linear-chain CRFs (Laffertyet al 2001).
More recently, there has been a de-sire to include more factors, longer range depen-dencies, and more sophisticated features; these in-clude skip-chain CRFs for named entity recogni-tion (Sutton and McCallum, 2004), probabilisticDBs (Wick et al 2010), higher-order models fordependency parsing (Carreras, 2007), entity-wisemodels for coreference (Culotta et al 2007; Wicket al 2009), and global models of relations (Hoff-mann et al 2011).
The increasing sophistication ofthese individual NLP components compounded withthe community?s desire to model these tasks jointlyacross cross-document considerations has resultedin graphical models for which inference is compu-tationally intractable.
Even popular approximate in-ference techniques such as loopy belief propagationand Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) may beprohibitively slow.MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastingsare usually efficient for graphical models becausethe only factors needed to score a proposal are thosetouching the changed variables.
However, MCMCis slowed in situations where a) the model exhibitsvariables that have a high-degree (neighbor manyfactors), b) proposals modify a substantial subset ofthe variables to satisfy domain constraints (such astransitivity in coreference), or c) evaluating a singlefactor is expensive, for example when features arebased on string-similarity.
For example, the seem-ingly innocuous proposal changing the entity type ofa single entity requires examining all its mentions,i.e.
scoring a linear number of factors (in the num-ber of mentions of that entity).
Similarly, evaluatingcoreference of a mention to an entity also requiresscoring factors to all the mentions of the entity.
Of-ten, however, the factors are somewhat redundant,for example, not all mentions of the ?USA?
entityneed to be examined to confidently conclude that itis a COUNTRY, or that it is coreferent with ?United1104States of America?.In this paper we propose an approximate MCMCframework that facilitates efficient inference in high-degree graphical models.
In particular, we approx-imate the acceptance ratio in the Metropolis Hast-ings algorithm by replacing the exact model scorewith a stochastic approximation that samples fromthe set of relevant factors.
We explore two samplingstrategies, a fixed proportion approach that samplesthe factors uniformly, and a dynamic alternative thatsamples factors until the method is confident aboutits estimate of the model score.We evaluate our method empirically on both syn-thetic and real-world data.
On synthetic classi-fication data, our approximate MCMC procedureobtains the true marginals faster than a traditionalMCMC sampler.
On real-world tasks, our methodachieves 7 times speedup on citation matching, and13 times speedup on large-scale author disambigua-tion.2 Background2.1 Graphical ModelsFactor graphs (Kschischang et al 2001) succinctlyrepresent the joint distribution over random vari-ables by a product of factors that make the depen-dencies between the random variables explicit.
Afactor graph is a bipartite graph between the vari-ables and factors, where each (log) factor f ?
F isa function that maps an assignment of its neighbor-ing variables to a real number.
For example, in alinear-chain model of part-of-speech tagging, transi-tion factors score compatibilities between consecu-tive labels, while emission factors score compatibil-ities between a label and its observed token.The probability distribution expressed by the fac-tor graph is given as a normalized product of the fac-tors, which we rewrite as an exponentiated sum:p(y) =exp?(y)Z(1)?
(y) =?f?Ff(yf ) (2)Z =?y?Yexp?
(y) (3)Intuitively, the model favors assignments to the ran-dom variables that yield higher factor scores and willassign higher probabilities to such configurations.The two common inference problems for graphi-cal models in NLP are maximum a posterior (MAP)and marginal inference.
For models without latentvariables, the MAP estimate is the setting to thevariables that has the highest probability under themodel:yMAP = argmaxyp(y) (4)Marginal inference is the problem of findingmarginal distributions over subsets of the variables,used primarily in maximum likelihood gradients andfor max marginal inference.2.2 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)Often, computing marginal estimates of a model iscomputationally intractable due to the normalizationconstant Z, while maximum a posteriori (MAP) isprohibitive due to the search space of possible con-figurations.
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) isimportant tool for performing sample- and search-based inference in these models.
A particularly suc-cessful MCMC method for graphical model infer-ence is Metropolis-Hastings (MH).
Since samplingfrom the true model p(y) is intractable, MH insteaduses a simpler distribution q(y?|y) that conditionson a current state y and proposes a new state y?
bymodifying a few variables.
This new assignment isthen accepted with probability ?:?
= min(1,p(y?)p(y)q(y|y?
)q(y?|y))(5)Computing this acceptance probability is oftenhighly efficient because the partition function can-cels, as do all the factors in the model that do notneighbor the modified variables.
MH can be usedfor both MAP and marginal inference.2.2.1 Marginal InferenceTo compute marginals with MH, the variables areinitialized to an arbitrary assignment (i.e., randomlyor with some heuristic), and sampling is run until thesamples {yi|i = 0, ?
?
?
, n} become independent ofthe initial assignment.
The ergodic theorem providesthe MCMC analog to the law-of-large-numbers, jus-tifying the use of the generated samples to computethe desired statistics (such as feature expectations orvariable marginals).11052.2.2 MAP InferenceSince MCMC can efficiently explore the highdensity regions for a given distribution, the distri-bution p can be modified such that the high-densityregion of the new distribution represents the MAPconfiguration of p. This is achieved by adding a tem-perature term ?
to the distribution p, resulting in thefollowing MH acceptance probability:?
= min(1,(p(y?
)p(y)) 1?
)(6)Note that as ?
?
0, MH will sample closer to theMAP configuration.
If a cooling schedule is imple-mented for ?
then the MH sampler for MAP infer-ence can be seen as an instance of simulated anneal-ing (Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis, 1993).3 Monte Carlo MCMCIn this section we introduce our approach for ap-proximating the acceptance ratio of Metropolis-Hastings that samples the factors, and describe twosampling strategies.3.1 Stochastic Proposal EvaluationAlthough one of the benefits of MCMC lies in itsability to leverage the locality of the proposal, forsome information extraction tasks this can become acrucial bottleneck.
In particular, evaluation of eachsample requires computing the score of all the fac-tors that are involved in the change, i.e.
all fac-tors that neighbor any variable in the set that haschanged.
This evaluation becomes a bottleneck fortasks in which a large number of variables is in-volved in each proposal, or in which the model con-tains a number of high-degree variables, resulting ina large number of factors, or in which computingthe factor score involves an expensive computation,such as string similarity between mention text.Instead of evaluating the log-score ?
of the modelexactly, this paper proposes a Monte-Carlo estima-tion of the log-score.
In particular, if the set of fac-tors for a given proposal y?
y?
is F(y,y?
), we usea sampled subset of the factors S ?
F(y,y?)
as anapproximation of the model score.
In the followingwe use F as an abbreviation for F(y,y?).
Formally,?
(y) =?f?Ff(yf ) = |F| ?
EF [f(yf )]?S(y) = |F| ?
ES [f(yf )] (7)We use the sample log-score (?S) in the acceptanceprobability ?
to evaluate the samples.
Since we areusing a stochastic approximation to the model score,in general we need to take more MCMC samplesbefore we converge, however, since evaluating eachsample will be much faster (O(|S|) as opposed toO(|F|)), we expect overall sampling to be faster.In the next sections we describe several alternativestrategies for sampling the set of factors S. The pri-mary restriction on the set of samples S is that theirmean should be an unbiased estimator ofEF[f ].
Fur-ther, time taken to obtain the set of samples shouldbe negligible when compared to scoring all the fac-tors in F. Note that there is an implicit minimum of1 to the number of the sampled factors.3.2 Uniform SamplingThe most direct approach for subsampling the setof F is to perform uniform sampling.
In particular,given a proportion parameter 0 < p ?
1, we select arandom subset Sp ?
F such that |Sp| = p ?
|F|.
Sincethis approach is agnostic as to the actual factorsscores, ES[f ] ?
EF[f ].
A low p leads to fast evalua-tion, however it may require a large number of sam-ples due to the substantial approximation.
On theother hand, although a higher p will converge withfewer samples, evaluating each sample is slower.3.3 Confidence-Based SamplingSelecting the best value for p is difficult, requiringanalysis of the graph structure, and statistics on thedistribution of the factors scores; often a difficulttask in real-world applications.
Further, the samevalue for p can result in different levels of approxi-mation for different proposals, either unnecessarilyaccurate or problematically noisy.
We would prefera strategy that adapts to the distribution of the scoresin F.Instead of sampling a fixed proportion of factors,we can sample until we are confident that the cur-rent set of samples Sc is an accurate estimate of thetrue mean of F. In particular, we maintain a run-ning count of the sample mean ESc [f ] and variance1106?Sc , using them to compute a confidence interval ISaround our estimate of the mean.
Since the num-ber of sampled factors S could be a substantial frac-tion of the set of factors F,1 we also incorporate fi-nite population control (fpc) in our sample variancecomputation.
We compute the confidence interval asfollows:?2S =1|S| ?
1?f?S(f ?
ES [f ])2 (8)IS = 2z?S?|S|?|F| ?
|S||F| ?
1(9)where we set the z to 1.96, i.e.
the 95% confidenceinterval.
This approach starts with an empty set ofsamples, S = {}, and iteratively samples factorswithout replacement to add to S, until the confidenceinterval around the estimated mean falls below a userspecified maximum interval width threshold i.
As aresult, for proposals that contain high-variance fac-tors, this strategy examines a large number of fac-tors, while proposals that involve similar factors willresult in fewer samples.
Note that this user-specifiedthreshold is agnostic to the graph structure and thenumber of factors, and instead directly reflects thescore distribution of the relevant factors.4 ExperimentsIn this section we evaluate our approach for bothmarginal and MAP inference.4.1 Marginal Inference on Synthetic DataConsider the task of classifying entities into a set oftypes, for example, POLITICIAN, VEHICLE, CITY,GOVERMENT-ORG, etc.
For knowledge base con-struction, this prediction often takes place on theentity-level, as opposed to the mention-level com-mon in traditional NLP.
To evaluate the type at theentity-level, the scored factors examine features ofall the entity mentions of the entity, along with thelabels of all relation mentions for which it is an ar-gument.
See Yao et al(2010) and Hoffmann et al(2011) for examples of such models.
Since a sub-set of the mentions can be sufficiently informativefor the model, we expect our stochastic MCMC ap-proach to work well.1Specifically, the fraction may be higher than > 5%Label(a) Binary ClassificationModel (n = 100)-4.8 -4 -3.2 -2.4 -1.6 -0.8 0 0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4 4.8 5.6 6.4 7.2-0.4-0.3-0.2-0.10.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9Label 1Label 0(b) Distribution of Factor scoresFigure 1: Synthetic Model for Classification1 0 2 0 3 0 100 200 1000 10000 100000 1000000Number of Factors Examined0.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.1250.1500.1750.2000.2250.2500.2750.3000.3250.3500.3750.4000.4250.450Error in Marginalp:1. p:0.75 p:0.5 p:0.2p:0.1 i:0.1 i:0.05 i:0.01i:0.005 i:0.001Figure 2: Marginal Inference Error for Classificationon Synthetic DataWe use synthetic data for such a model to evaluatethe quality of marginals returned by the Gibbs sam-pling form of MCMC.
Since the Gibbs algorithmsamples each variable using a fixed assignment ofits neighborhood, we represent generating a singlesample as classification.
We create star-shaped mod-els with a single unobserved variable (entity type)that neighbors many unary factors, each represent-ing a single entity- or a relation-mention factor (SeeFigure 1a for an example).
We generate a syntheticdataset for this model, creating 100 variables con-sisting of 100 factors each.
The scores of the fac-tors are generated from gaussians, N(0.5, 1) for thepositive label, and N(?0.5, 1) for the negative label(note the overlap between the weights in Figure 1b).Although each structure contains only a single vari-able, and no cycles, it is a valid benchmark to testour sampling approach since the effects of the set-ting of burn-in period and the thinning samples arenot a concern.We perform standard Gibbs sampling, and com-1107pare the marginals obtained during sampling withthe true marginals, computed exactly.
We evalu-ate the previously described uniform sampling andconfidence-based sampling, with several parametervalues, and plot the L1 error to the true marginalsas more factors are examined.
Note that here, andin the rest of the evaluation, we shall use the num-ber of factors scored as a proxy for running time,since the effects of the rest of the steps of sam-pling are relatively negligible.
The error in compar-ison to regular MCMC (p = 1) is shown in Fig-ure 2, with standard error bars averaging over 100models.
Initially, as the sampling approach is mademore stochastic (lowering p or increasing i), we seea steady improvement in the running time neededto obtain the same error tolerance.
However, theamount of relative improvements slows as stochas-ticity is increased further; in fact for extreme values(i = 0.05, p = 0.1) the chains perform worse thanregular MCMC.4.2 Entity Resolution in Citation DataTo evaluate our approach on a real world dataset,we apply stochastic MCMC for MAP inference onthe task of citation matching.
Given a large numberof citations (that appear at the end of research pa-pers, for example), the task is to group together thecitations that refer to the same paper.
The citationmatching problem is an instance of entity resolution,in which observed mentions need to be partitionedsuch that mentions in a set refer to the same under-lying entity.
Note that neither the identities, or thenumber of underlying entities is known.In this paper, the graphical model of entity reso-lution consists of observed mentions (mi), and pair-wise binary variables between all pairs of mentions(yij) which represent whether the corresponding ob-served mentions are coreferent.
There is a localfactor for each coreference variable yij that has ahigh score if the underlying mentions mi and mjare similar.
For the sake of efficiency, we only in-stantiate and incorporate the variables and factorswhen the variable is true, i.e.
if yij = 1.
Thus,?
(y) =?e?mi,mj?ef(yij).
The set of possibleworlds consists of all settings of the y variables thatare consistent with transitivity, i.e.
the binary vari-ables directly represent a valid clustering over thementions.
An example of the model defined over 5m2m1m3m5m41111y12y23y13y45Figure 3: Graphical Model for Entity Resolution:defined over 5 mentions, with the setting of the vari-ables resulting in 2 entities.
For the sake of brevity,we?ve only included variables set to 1; binary vari-ables between mentions that are not coreferent havebeen omitted.mentions is given in Figure 3.
This representationis equivalent to Model 2 as introduced in McCal-lum and Wellner (2004).
As opposed to belief prop-agation and other approximate inference techniques,MCMC is especially appropriate for the task as itcan directly enforce transitivity.When performing MCMC, each sample is a set-ting to all the y variables that is consistent with tran-sitivity.
To maintain transitivity during sampling,Metropolis Hastings is used to change the binaryvariables in a way that is consistent with moving in-dividual mentions.
Our proposal function selects arandom mention, and moves it to a random entity,changing all the pairwise variables with mentions inits old entity, and the pairwise variables with men-tions in its new entity.
Thus, evaluation of such aproposal function requires scoring a number of fac-tors linear in the size of the entities, which, for largedatasets, can be a significant bottleneck.
In prac-tice, however, these set of factors are often highlyredundant, as many of the mentions that refer to thesame entity contain redundant information and fea-tures, and entity membership may be efficiently de-termined by observing a subset of its mentions.We evaluate on the Cora dataset (McCallum etal., 1999), used previously to evaluate a numberof information extraction approaches (Pasula et al2003), including MCMC based inference (Poon andDomingos, 2007; Singh et al 2009).

We use the same features for ourmodel as (Poon and Domingos, 2007), using trueauthor, title, and venue segmentation for features.Since our focus is on evaluating scalability of in-ference, we combine all the three folds of the data,and train the model using Samplerank (Wick et al2011).We run MCMC on the entity resolution model us-ing the proposal function described above, runningour approach with different parameter values.
Sincewe are interested in the MAP configuration, we usea temperature term for annealing.
As inference pro-gresses, we compute BCubed2 F1 of the currentsample, and plot it against the number of scored fac-tors in Figure 4.
We observe consistent speed im-provements as stochasticity is improved, with uni-form sampling and confidence-based sampling per-forming competitively.
To compute the speedup, wemeasure the number of factors scored to obtain a de-sired level of accuracy (90% F1), shown for a di-verse set of parameters in Table 1.
With a verylarge confidence interval threshold (i = 20) andsmall proportion (p = 0.1), we obtain up to 7 timesspeedup over regular MCMC.
Since the average en-tity size in this data set is < 10, using a small pro-portion (and a wide interval) is equivalent to pickinga single mention to compare against.2B3 is a coreference evaluation metric, introduced by Baggaand Baldwin (1998)Method Factors Examined SpeedupBaseline 57,292,700 1xUniform Samplingp = 0.75 34,803,972 1.64xp = 0.5 28,143,323 2.04xp = 0.3 17,778,891 3.22xp = 0.2 12,892,079 4.44xp = 0.1 7,855,686 7.29xVariance-Based Samplingi = 0.001 52,522,728 1.09xi = 0.01 51,547,000 1.11xi = 0.1 47,165,038 1.21xi = 0.5 32,828,823 1.74xi = 1 18,938,791 3.02xi = 2 11,134,267 5.14xi = 5 9,827,498 5.83xi = 10 8,675,833 6.60xi = 20 8,295,587 6.90xTable 1: Speedups on Cora to obtain 90% B3 F14.3 Large-Scale Author CoreferenceAs the body of published scientific work continuesto grow, author coreference, the problem of clus-tering mentions of research paper authors into thereal-world authors to which they refer, is becomingan increasingly important step for performing mean-ingful bibliometric analysis.
However, scaling typi-cal pairwise models of coreference (e.g., McCallumand Wellner (2004)) is difficult because the numberof factors in the model grows quadratically with thenumber of mentions (research papers) and the num-ber of factors evaluated for every MCMC proposalscales linearly in the size of the clusters.
For authorcoreference, the number of author mentions and thenumber of references to an author entity can often bein the millions, making the evaluation of the MCMCproposals computationally expensive.We use the publicly available DBLP dataset3 ofBibTex entries as our unlabeled set of mentions,which contains nearly 5 million authors.
For eval-uation of accuracy, we also include author mentionsfrom the Rexa corpus4 that contains 2, 833 mentions3http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/?ley/db/4http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/aculotta/data/rexa.html110910000000 100000000 1000000000 10000000000Number of Factors Examined0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.500.550.600.650.700.750.800.850.900.951.001.05BCubed F1p:1. p:0.5 p:0.2 p:0.1p:0.01 i:10. i:1. i:0.1(a) Accuracy versus Number of Factors scored10000000 100000000Number of Samples0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.500.550.600.650.700.750.800.850.900.951.001.05BCubed F1p:1. p:0.5 p:0.2 p:0.1p:0.01 i:10. i:1. i:0.1(b) Accuracy versus Number of SamplesFigure 5: Performance of Different Sampling Strategies and Parameters for coreference over 5 millionmentions.
Plot with p refer to uniform sampling with proportion p of factors picked, while plots with isample till confidence intervals are narrower than i.labeled for coreference.We use the same Metropolis-Hastings scheme thatwe employ in the problem of citation matching.
Asbefore, we initialize to the singleton configurationand run the experiments for a fixed number of sam-ples, plotting accuracy versus the number of factorsevaluated (Figure 5a) as well as accuracy versus thenumber of samples generated (Figure 5b).
We alsotabulate the relative speedups to obtain the desiredaccuracy level in Table 2.
Our proposed methodachieves substantial savings on this task: speedupsof 13.16 using the variance sampler and speedupsof 9.78 using the uniform sampler.
As expected,when we compare the performance using the num-ber of generated samples, the approximate MCMCchains appear to converge more slowly; however, theoverall convergence for our approach is substantiallyfaster because evaluation of each sample is signif-icantly cheaper.
We also present results on usingextreme approximations (for example, p = 0.01),resulting in convergence to a low accuracy.5 Discussion and Related WorkMCMC is a popular method for inference amongstresearchers that work with large and dense graphi-cal models (Richardson and Domingos, 2006; Poonand Domingos, 2006; Poon et al 2008; Singh et al2009; Wick et al 2009).

Although most of these methods applyMCMC directly, the rate of convergence of MCMChas become a concern as larger and more densely-factored models are being considered, motivatingthe need for more efficient sampling that uses par-allelism (Singh et al 2011; Gonzalez et al 2011)1110and domain knowledge for blocking (Singh et al2010).
Thus we feel providing a method to speed upMCMC inference can have a significant impact.There has also been recent work in designingscalable approximate inference techniques.
Beliefpropagation has, in particular, has gained some re-cent interest.
Similar to our approach, a numberof researchers propose modifications to BP that per-form inference without visiting all the factors.
Re-cent work introduces dynamic schedules to priori-tize amongst the factors (Coughlan and Shen, 2007;Sutton and McCallum, 2007) that has been used toonly visit a small fraction of the factors (Riedel andSmith, 2010).
Gonzalez et al(2009) utilize theseschedules to facilitate parallelization.A number of existing approaches in statisticsare also related to our contribution.
Leskovec andFaloutsos (2006) propose techniques to sample agraph to compute certain graph statistics with asso-ciated confidence.
Christen and Fox (2005) also pro-pose an approach to efficiently evaluate a proposal,however, once accepted, they score all the factors.Murray and Ghahramani (2004) propose an approx-imate MCMC technique for Bayesian models thatestimates the partition function instead of comput-ing it exactly.Related work has also applied such ideas forrobust learning, for example Kok and Domingos(2005), based on earlier work by Hulten and Domin-gos (2002), uniformly sample the groundings of anMLN to estimate the likelihood.6 Conclusions and Future WorkMotivated by the need for an efficient inference tech-nique that can scale to large, densely-factored mod-els, this paper considers a simple extension to theMarkov chain Monto Carlo algorithm.
By observ-ing that many graphical models contain substantialredundancy among the factors, we propose stochas-tic evaluation of proposals that subsamples the fac-tors to be scored.
Using two proposed samplingstrategies, we demonstrate improved convergencefor marginal inference on synthetic data.
Further,we evaluate our approach on two real-world entityresolution datasets, obtaining a 13 times speedup ona dataset containing 5 million mentions.Based on the ideas presented in the paper, we willconsider additional sampling strategies.
In partic-ular, we will explore dynamic sampling, in whichwe sample fewer factors during the initial, burn-in phase, but sample more factors as we get closeto convergence.
Motivated by our positive results,we will also study the application of this approachto other approximate inference techniques, such asbelief propagation and variational inference.
Sincetraining is often a huge bottleneck for informationextraction, we will also explore its applications toparameter estimation.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the Center forIntelligent Information Retrieval, in part by ARFLunder prime contract number is FA8650-10-C-7059,and the University of Massachusetts gratefully ac-knowledges the support of Defense Advanced Re-search Projects Agency (DARPA) Machine Read-ing Program under Air Force Research Laboratory(AFRL) prime contract no.
