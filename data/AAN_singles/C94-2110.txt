co. ukAbstractWe present an approach to lexical knowledge rep-resentation where different uses of the same wordcan be conflated into a single meta-entry which en-codes regnlarities about sense/usage extensibility.This approach makes it possible to solve lexicalanrbiguities by using contextual information (lur-ing language processing to ground underspecifiedword entries, and can be efficiently implementedwithin a typed feature structure formalism.1 I n t roduct ionOne of the central aspects of lexical knowledge, per-haps the most significant in characterizing the creativeaspect of language use, is our ability to generate appro~priate uses of words in coutext.
This ability is usuallyexercized by manipulating semantic and/or syntacticproperties of words to achieve desirable collocationalsettings.
Some illustrative examples are given in (1)where?
move can be interpreted as a psychological verbwhen used transitively with a sentient direct object,* enjoy can take either a noun or verb phrase com-plement when used in the expeT~ence s nse (Puste-jovsky, 1991, 1993; Briscoe, Copestake & Boguraev,1990),, accord is synonymous with either agree or give/granldepending on its valency (Poznafiski & Sanfilippo,1993), and* the occurrence of a directional argument with swimtriggers a shift in aspectual interpretation.

agitate, crash,cross, lift, slrike, sweep, unwind) with the causer co lresponding to the stimulus argument and the theme tothe experieneer.
Similarly, the option of either a nounor verb phrase complement for enjoy can be extendedto many other psychological verbs with experiencersubjects (e.g.
hale, like, lnvfeO, and verbs of undi-rected motion in English (e.g.
carry, drive, float, push,run, swim, walk) can subcategorize for an expression ofcompleted path so as to yield a telic/directed interpre-tation (Tahny, 1985; Sanfilippo el al., 1992; Sanfilippo,11994).
Moreover, the metonymical and metaphoricprocesses which are responsible for sense/usage extcn-sious appear to be sul)ject to crosslinguistic variatiou.For example, the "meat vs. animal" alternatkm thatis found in English -- viz.
feed lh.e lamb vs. eal lamb- -  is absent in Eskimo (Nunberg &.
Zaencn, 1992) aswell as in l)utch where nominal compomlding is usedinstead -.
e.g.
lain vs. lamvlees (Copestake & Saniil-ippo, 1993).Exanrples of this sort show that our ability to exteudword use in context is often systematic or conventiomalized.
As Pustejovsky and Boguraev (1993) point out,traditional approaches to lexical representation assumethat word use extensibility can be modeled by exhaus-tively describiug the meaning of a word through closedenumeration of its senses: each sense corresponds to apredefined context.
This practice has largely charac-terized the compilation of dictionary entries in the tex-icographic tradition and has consequently iniluencedthe shape of comlmtational lexicons since the largescale construction of such lexicons has typically in-volved semiautomatic knowledge acquisition from ma-chine readable dictionaries (Carroll & Grover, 1989).Word sense enumeration provides highly specializedlexical entries, but?
it fails to make explicit regularities about word sensecxtensibility which are necessary in promoting com-pactedness in lexical description,?
it is at odds with our ability to create new word usesin novel contexts, and?
it generates massive lexic~d ambiguity.The use of lexical rules to generate different uses of aword fl'om a kernel entry (Copestake gg Briscoe, 199l;Sanfilippo, 1994) provides a 1)rincipled alternative toword sense enumeration and can be made to eater foruovel uses of words.
Ilowever, it is not clear whetherthis practice can address the question of lexical ambi-guity suc(:essfully as there is no known general control696regime on lexicM rules which would dctcrmiuisti(:allyrestrict polysemic explmsion without preenq)ting thegeneration of l)ossible word uses.The goM , f  this paper is to show how a more dy-namic approach to lexical stlecilic;~tion can Iic usedto tackle the l)roblem of lexical a, nhiguity and at thesame time to model creative aZl)ccts of word usage.
Inparticular, our objective is to present ways iu whichword sense enmner~d;ion c n be eschewed by contlatingdifferent word senses into a single recta-entry whichallows sense/usage expansiou without reliance on coercive operations /lel, as lexical rules.
This approachis implemented within ~L typed feature structure lilt.-realism where word sense coutlatkm c~tn be c.xpressedin terms of lexical type uudersllcCificatiou: a wnrd en-try is ~Lssociated with a lcxical tylle havi ,g suhtypeextensious which describe llossible uses of the word.This approach makes it possible to solw~ \[exical am--biguities by usinr; syntactic and semantic context.alinformation during language processing to ground un.derspecitled word entries.2 Lex lca l  Po lymorph ism and q 'ypeReso lu t ionOur lloints of dep~Lrture are.

(4) solve_head_type(Lex_Type) ifmember (Lex Type, \[iv_undir_synsem,iv_obl_dir_synsem .... \] )solve_head_type can be integrated with grammarrules as shown schematically in Fig 2 so thata verbal head exhibiting valency mnbiguity (e.g.iv_undlr_or_ iv_obl_d l r~ynsem) with contextual in-stantiation of its list of complements - eAist orpp_comp- l ist ,  as defined in (5) - -  would return a fullyresolved FS ( iv-synseln or iv_obl_synsem in Fig 1).This way of carrying out lexical type resolution hascomputationM overheads which tend to grow propor-tionally to the number of unambiguous lexical types.This is simply because lexical type resolution is doneby unifying underspecified synsem FSs against a listof unambiguous lexical synsem FSs using the mem-bership predicate: the longer the list, the heavier thecomputational overhead.
With about thirty unam-biguous verb types, we found that the disambignationof polymorphic lexical types using -~olve head_typewith simple sentences was slower than enumeration ofeach distinct option through lexical disjunction--- al-though the difference in performance tended to cou-verge as we tried tinting longer and more complex sen.?\ [phrase  \]SYNSEM:SYN:LOC:COMPS = \ [ \ ]  comp- l l s t  \]\[.i~.

IIowever, we thought that better results yetcould be achieved by exploiting conditions on con-straint introduction rather than using unification withthe list of unambiguous synsem FSs.Since in ALE path values can be introduced as con-straints, an attribute and its value can be used to re-trieve the type at which that value was introduced:I ?- res t r i c ts (Type ,hd ,pp_synsem) .Type = pp_comp_l istOur basic idea was to define a rec.ursive definition ofthis facility and use it as a procedural attachment onrules to enhance lexical type resolution during lan-guage processing.
For example, we could use the valuefor thc \[lead of tile compdis t  of a verb - -  as provided698in tile course of rule application and the l)ath atwhich such value occurs to resolve the verb's lexiealtype, e.g.\[ 7- rec restricts(iv_or iv_obl_eynsem,eyn : loc : comps : hd : pp_syns em,SubType).SubType = iv_obl eynsemThis allowed us to carry out ambiguous lexieal typeresolution without having to cheek type compatibilityagainst a list of unambiguous lexicM types.We devised a version of rec_ res t r i c ts  which givenan ambiguous lexical type and the resolving con|rain|returns the appropriate grounded type byI.

This solution proved to t)e far more el-tic|cut than the previous one.
and never yielded worseresults when compared to the enumeration of each dis-t inct verl) valency option through lexical disjunctkm.3 In i t ia l  Resu l ts  and  Env isagedImprovementsUsing the treatment outlined above, we have (levelopeda tyt)e lattice covering all ntajor comph!mentation pat-terns for English and (~erman (over 30 frames) witha variety of intermediate polymorphic types describ-ing possible clusters of subcategorization l)tions.

.With simple structures i~s the one in (6), the ed-win|age ill using i)olynaorphic lexical types with sortresolution ~s comparexl to word sense euumerationby lexical disjnnction is minimal even though fewerchart edges are built.
This is because there is a con-stant ow'Mlead when doing polymorphic type resolu-tion through solve_head_type which in these c~mesis equivalent o building a l~w more lexieal edges.With more complex sentences, however, this overheadis soon offset, and the benefits of using lexical poly-morphism t)eeome manifest, l,'or example, the analysisof a sentence like John likes that they want go comeusing polymort)hie verb types produce(l 23 edges andwas about 15% faster than the analysis yMded usinga lexicon with verb usage enumeration where 34 edgeswere built.We are also cent|dent that we can iml)rove the t)e>formance of our el)preach in at, least two regards.First, we can reduce the co,nputational effort cur-rent;ly used in ensuring that the input lexieal tyl)e tosolve_head_type has not been altered ~s a result ofsome previous rule el)plies|ion.
Such a measure isneeded, R)r example, when a w.'rb with l)olymorl)hietype undergoes morphological combination before thehead-complement rule el)plies.
In this clme, the se-mantics of the verb wouhl be altered with a conse-quent loss of the original (polymorphie) lexical type.This wouht make lexical type resohttion impossible.We must therefore avoid destructive ntodilications ofthe or|gluM lexical type while resohttion of such typeis still possibh: by introducing in the sign a structurewhere the semantics of the bound morl)heme is storeduntil all verbal arguments are  COltSllllled. '
l 'he  storedsenl.atlties is then retrieved using procedural a t tachments.
This retrievM is eomputationally expensive imit is carried out by inealls of procedural attachme.nts,and we are now investigating the alternative of build-ing the resulting semantics on line where it is currentlystored.Second, we can make lexical type resolution byroe_res t r i c ts  nlore deterministic in those caseswhere the solving constraint does not lead to a uniquesolution, as discussed earlier with reference to the verbbring.
In the lexicon, briu9 is assigned the polymorl)hie.type tv_or_tv_obl_or.
.d itrans_syns(, .m which sub-sumes the tlu'ee uses of tim verb exemplified in (2):tv .
.
synsem in (2a), tv._old__(litrans ynsem in (2b),and d i t rans  syns( ;m in lab).
Because the three sub-types are consistent with a direct object subcategoriza-lion, z -ec_restr?cts  Callnot provide a unique solutionwhen parsing bring with a nouu l)hrase complement.This is l)eeause, rec_ res t r?cts  carries out sort resolu-tion of a I)olymorphic type by elmcking consistency of699the discriminating constraint against all minimal (mostspecific) subtypes of the polymorphie type.
Conse-quently, tee_restricts would return three solutionsfor bring using the instantiation for the head of thecompl l s t  to np_synsem, as would the use of gener-alized recursive constraint resolution.
In our approach,however, this inadequacy can be easily redressed by?
changing rec_res~ricts so that sort resohltion isdone by returning the maximal (least specific) sub-type of the input polymorphic type at which thediscriminating constraint is introduced, and?
modifying the grammar so as to support such achange.
1As long as the same constraint is not introducedat several subtypes for each polymorphic type to besolved, these changes will ensure that sort resolutionby tee_res t r i c ts  i always deterministic.4 Conc lus ionIf the computational nalysis of natural anguage isto approach the ease with which language users man-age the contextual determination of word usage, anapproach to lexical ambiguity is needed which capi-talizes on the regularity of sense extensions to avoidundiscriminated generation of word uses during sen-tencc processing.
Our proposal to achieve this objec-tive is to use lexical polymorphism with deterministiccontextual sort resolution within a type feature struc-ture formalism.
Such a proposal is based on the intu-ition that for each class of lexieal ambiguity there isa word substructure whose increnmntal instautiationprovides ufficient discriminating information to selecta unique solntion.
We have shown how a first imple-mentation of such an approach can be realized for thedomain of verbal diatheses and envisaged how furtherrefinements can be carried out to arrive at a fidl spec-ification.
Although it is too early to establish whetheror not the approach can be made to handle all kinds oflexical ambiguity, initial results uggest that our treat-ment is effective, efficient and has natural applicationsin domains other than verbal diatheses.ReferencesAtkins B.
