The Concept Dictionary isbased on several linguistic semantic representation theories and consists of : a) concept descriptions, and b) the concept taxonomy.Moreover, pnfference knowledge is being collected fi'om output data of various testing systems.1.
IntroductionA dictionary in which dependencies among 400,000 word senses of the English and Japanese languages aredescribed in detail (Concept Dictionary) is being developed by EDR.
The goal of the development is o build aneutral dictionary for natural anguage semantic processing that is available for various application systems.The implementation of the dictionary is based on several linguistic semantic representation theories.For a long time, a series of trials for describing dependencies among words or word senses by bundlingverbs, adjectives, etc., has been conducted.
Establishing adeep case level and using a formalism independentof each language, Fillmore developed a theory of representation of dependency among words (Fillmore 1968).On the other hand, Fodor and Katz explained a mechanism of selecting interpretations of constituents in asentence by using a formalism composed of a semantic marker, distinguisher and selection restriction (Katzand Fodor 1963).
In contrast to these theories, Wilks proposed a point of view to consider word dependencynot as a constraint but as a preference (Wilks 1975).
In addition, Schank proposed to abstract connotationsnot only from senses of nouns but also those of verbs, and he named them "primitive actions" (Schank 1975).These semantic representation theories have been reviewed and used in developing practical natural languageprocessing systems (Nagao 1985, etc.
).As such development of practical natural anguage processing systems progressed, the importance ofaccumulating lexJcal descriptions became recognized by developers of such systems.
That is, a dictionary largeenough in terms of both the granularity of semantic markers and the number of words or word senses becamenecessary tobuild.
Against he background of the situation, the development of the Concept Dictionary began(Kakizaki 1987, Yokoi et.
el.
1989, Uchida, 1990, Miik?
et.
el.
1990a).
The methodology of development of206the Concept Dictionary, which consists of a) concept descriptions, which represent dependencies amongconcepts and categories, and b) the concept axonomy, which represent super-sub relations among concepts,is described in sections 2 and 3.
Preference knowledge, which represents preference order of conceptdescriptions, i  explained in section 4. in section 5, spheres of applications and limitations of the dictionaryarc discussed.2.
Development of Concept DescriptionsConcept relations are described at the following three levels:a) concept-concept relation descriptionsb) concept-category relation descriptionsc) category-category reladon descriptions2.1 Concept -concept  Relat ion Descr ip t ionsWe are building an on-line corpus which includes 1,000,000 practical example sentences that are analyzedlexically, syntactically and semantically for the most pan manually (EDR corpus).
Figure 1 is an example ofan entry of the corpus.Firstly, (a) is the word sense selection (le?ical analysis) section, where a word sense (concept) has beenselected for each word in the sentence.
Secondly, (b) is the syntactic analysis section, where all bindingrelations among words has been analyzed.
Finally, (c) is the semantic analysis section, where the semanticnetwork representing the meaning of the sentence is decomposed into a set of triplets.
These tripletscorrespond to the following concept-concept relation descriptions:(I) c#enlarg?--<and>-- c#newc#membership ---<object>~ ,#newc#bear --<location>'-" c#itc#bdng ~<?ause>--, cth'nembershipctWulnerable --<goal>--- c#pressurec#fluid--<modify>'-" c#sdllc~11uid--<object>~ c~the_U,Nc~fluid--<modify>'" c~so'ucturaHyc#membership ---<object>~ c~tenlargec#membcrship--<modify>---" c#itsc#bring--<goaJ>--'- c#bearc#pressure *-<object>-- c#bringc#vulnerable--<and>'--" c#tluidc#vulnerable ~<modify>-, c#sdllc#vulnerable ~<object>'-- c#the_U.Nc#vulnerabl?
~<modify>-* c#structurallyAs shown above, concept-concept relation descriptions are extracted irectly from the semantic analysissecdon (and word sense selection section) in the EDR Corpus.
A method of collecting and selecting sourcesentences for the EDR corpus is described in (Nakao 1990a) and a method of extracting concept descriptionsfrom the FEDR corpus is explained in detail in (Nakao 1990b).Source texts of the EDR corpus are selected so as to diversify as much as possible the concepts in them.However, it is impossible to collect all concepts or concept relations from the corpus even if the amount oftexts is very large.
To compensate for the shortage of examples, we also create example sentences and analyzethem lexically and semantically.
Concept-concept relation descriptions are also extracted from ~e sentences,207<<Text No : 00040000187d : 6/13/90 from ~J327#O3,y~l/4?>=>> Structurally.

An Entry of  the EDR Corpus2082.2 Concept-category Relation DescriptionsIf some concept-concept relations share a concept, it is possible to bundle them into a representation.
Forexample, concept.concept relation descriptions (2) can be bundled into a concept-category elation description(4), if a super-sub relation (3) is also described simultaneously within the concept axonomy.
'This level ofdescription corresponds to Fodor and Katz's representation using semantic markers and selection restrictions.

Moreover, frame concepts in deep case patterns can alsobe bundled and represented by categories (frame categories) (Ogino et.
al.
1989).
For example, the threecategories O1.2.6, 06.8.2 and C)9.14.4 defined in Figure 2 (Hereafter, the notation "C)" also means acategory,) bundle concepts and are linked with other categories to describe category-category elations (5), (6)and ("7) :(5) 01.2.6 --<agent>.>"-'," (Animals)01.2.6 --<object.>-- (Physical_Objects)O t.2.6 --<implement>--* (Parts_of_Animals)(6) 06.8.2 --<agent>-,' (Human_Beings)06,8.2 ---<object>'-.,.

Forexample, 06.8.2 includes a connotation that can be represented by MTRANS, which is one of the primitiveactions, although other frame categories do not always correspond to a primitive action.
In addition, relationsbetween verbs and adverbs, for example those mentioned in (La.koff 1966), are also described at this level.209::'"OI ,2 .6  ((For_an_Animal_to_Touch_a_Physical_Object)(With_a.Parz_of_the_Body))\[<aSont> : (Animals) ,<object> : (Physical_Objects) ,~mpk:ment> : (Parts_of_Animals) \]\[push\[p,m\[kick\[s=p\[graspEtm(<agent>: "a person", <object>: "a button".

Categories Q1.2:6, ~6.8.2, O9.14.4 and Exarnp!es of Their Sub.Concepts3 Development of the Concept TaxonomyThe two kinds of concept descriptions including categories, narncly concept-category relation descriptionsand category-category relation descriptions, mentioned in the previous sections, must have their descendantconcept-concept relations in order to become useful.
That is, concepts must be able to be actually classifiedinto categories included in such descriptions.A concept can generally be classified into more than one categories (multiple classification).
However itis difficult to make exhaustive multiple classification from the beginning, because in the case of multipleclassification, we must compare concepts with categories mn times when there are m concepts and ncategories.
In the case of exclusive classification using a distinctive u'e?
whose leaves mean categories, on theother hand, we must only compare concepts with nodes on the tree Ofrn(log n)) times.
Additionally, the210number of categories which share same sub-concepts with a category (cross categories) is generally much lessthan the number of all categories.
Moreover, it is not so difficult to make a list of cross categories for eachcategory (cross category list) in advance.Considering the points mentioned above, we use the following method for concept classification : 1)exclusive classification : selecting categories which hardly share same sub-concepts (exclusive categories), andmaking the first classification using a distinctive tree locating the exclusive categories atits leaf level.
2) crossclassification : making the second classification i to categories other than exclusive categories, based on crosscategory lists, and building a concept taxonomy from the results of the second classification.
3) improvementof the Concept Dictionary : modifying the Concept Dictionary based on the results from tests using varioustesting systems and automatic concept clustering from concept-concept relation descriptions.
In the followingsections 3.1 and 3.2, we explain the first exclusive classification and the second cross classificationrespectively.
In section 3.3, we describe amethod for modification of the Concept Dictionary.3.1 Exc lus ive  C lass i f i ca t ion  o f  Concepts3.1.1 C lass i f i ca t ion  into  MONO-Categor iesThe first classification into categories for nominal concepts (MONO-concepts) is made by using theMONO-concept taxonomy as shown in Figure 3 as a distinctive tree.
That is, the classification starts from thetop node, decends along branches of the tree, and when reaching a node, compares the node's children nodeswith the input concept.
This process is repeated, and if one of the leaves of the tree is reached, theMONO-category corresponding to the leave should ~ selected.

Ethnic_Groups)(Abs~,bjects)Figure 3. the MONO-Concept Taxonomy211For example, in the case of the concept "c#police_man", when we start with the question, "Is that aphysical object, a place or an abstract object?"
(answer.
aphysical object), and pass through the questions, "Isthat an animate object, a part of the body of an animate object, a natural object, a human artifact or anorganization?"
(answer: an animate object), "Is that a human being, an animal or a plant?"
(answer: a humanbeing), and "Is that a child, a relative, an occupation ...?"
(answer: an occupation), then we can classify theconcept into the category (Occupations) .\3.1,2 Classif ication into KOTO-Categor iesAs mentioned above, the first classification of the MONO-concepts i made by using the MONO-concepttaxonomy's hierarchy as a distinctive tree.
On the other hand, the method for the first classification of verbalconcepts (KOTO-concepts) is not made by using the hierarchy as a distinctive tree but by semantic associationfrom the meanings of the concepts and examples of deap case patterns of the concepts.The hierarchy has three levels.
The highest level has been divided coarsely based on semantic association(coarse semantic lusters; all can be seen in Figure 4).
The second level has been also divided based onsemantic association (fine semantic lusters; all below coarse semantic luster ~ I can be seen in Figure 5).On the contrar'y, the third level has been divided based on the deep case pattern shared by concepts(KOTO-categories; all below fine semantic luster ?
1.2 can be seen in Figure 6), where one category hasonly one deep case pattern which is specified with its distinctive pattern (expressed with the notation" \[... \] "as in Figure 2).
We have now 14 coarse semantic lusters, 253 fine semantic clusters and 984KOTO-categories in the hierarchy.. o(KOTO-Concepts)'~'I<SPATIAL_RELATIONS> : relations among physical objects meaning states and changes in space'~'2<SPATIAL_ATTRIBUTES> : attributes of physical objects meaning spatial measures in space'~'3<SOCIAL_RELATIONS> : social relations among persons'lff4<CLASS_RELATIONS> : inclusive relations and comparative relations among objectslffS<POSSESSION> : relations among possessors and possessions'~'6<INFORMAT1ON> : relations among information and information processers'~'7<ESTIMATION> : relations and attributes of objects meaning states and changes of their estimations?

KOTO-Categories Below ?
i .2213The first classification of a concept into the KOTO-categories is made based on semantic association withthe concept and deap case patterns created with the concept.
The procedures are as follows: I) ~signing basicconcepts into KOTO-categories: classifying about 4,000 basic concepts into fine semantic clusters, describingdeep case patterns underlying example sentences created with the concepts and dividing the clusters intoKOTO-categories to make each of them have only one deap case pattern.
2) Establishing two indexes :making a) a word index for retrieving categories by a word, and b) a case frame index for retrievingcategories by a deep case set.
3) Searching category candidates: a) searching category candidates byassociating basic concepts which seem to share a deap case pattern with the concept and retrieving the wordindex by words meaning the basic concepts, b) In a case in that it is impossible to associate any basic conceptswith the concept, finding category candidates by creating example sentences, making deap case frames fromthe sentences, and retrieving the case frame index by the frames to find category candidates.
4) Selecting acategory from the category candidates: classifying concepts into the most appropriate category by consideringfrom the following three points of view: a) the names of the categories and their upper clusters, b) thedistinctive patterns of the categories, and c) the basic concepts assigned to the categories.3.2 Cross Classification of ConceptsCross classification of concepts i made in the following way:l) Making cross category lists for each exclusive categories.
Types of cross relations are assorted intothe following three types: a) a cross category which implies an exclusive category, b) a crosscategory which intersects an exclusive category, and c) a cross category which includes an exclusivecategory.2) Contrasting each concept classified into an exclusive categoriy and each cross category listed in thecross category list of the exclusive category and judging whether or not the concept can be classifiedinto the cross category.
Here in the above case c), all concepts in the exclusive category can beautomatically classified into the cross category.3.3 Improvement of the Concept DictionaryThrough the following procedures, categories which should be modified ate found and improvement of theConcept Dictionary is made:1) Collecting negative xamples:When an answer other than correct answers is output from a testing system, an inappropriateconcept-concept relation must be found deduced from the Concept Dictionary by viewing a debugging~ace of the process of/he system.
Such concept-concept relations are collected as negative examples.2) Collecting positive xamples:When a correct answer is not output from a testing system, a concept-concept relation must be foundto be added to the Concept Dictionary.
Moreover, all correct answers output from all testing systems214must have their corresponding concept-concept relations deduced from the Concept Dictionary.
Theseconcept-concept relations are collected as positive xamples.3) Estimation:At a slage when negative and positive examples have been collected to some extent, the divisibility ofeach concept-category relation description and category-category relation description is estimated byusing the following formula:(8) D ( I ,  m,  n) = "~>~ qt/P(i),lwO\[ i V" - iI/~m-sJwhere P(a3 =.0 .< k ~ 1.0 (a parameter),n : the number of concepts under the category,i : the number of incorrect classifications into the category,m : the number of examples,I : the number of negative examples.The formula (8) is derived as follows:We suppose that the concept-category (or category,.cazegory) relation description (9) is an object of ourestimation:(9) a-  tel " "  Bthat the number of the concepts classified under the camgory B is n:( I0 )  Bbt b2 ..... b,and that the number of (both negauve and positive) examples is m and the number of negative examples in theexamples is h( i l )  m examplesa - -  r:l -- bta - -  ml  ~ b3a m tel --" b4a m tel ~ b.
* a - -  tel - -  bz* a ~ te l  ---.
b5((re.l) positive examples) (I negative xamples)i f  the number of concepts which are under the category B but not appropriate for the concept description (9) is i,215the probability that 1 negative examples are found out of m examples is given by the formula (12)".
'\ !
)~m-/ /(12) P(i) =Therefore, the probability that the ratio of the concepts not appropriate for the description (9) to the conceptslocated under the category B is more than k is given by the formula (8).
Here we use Bayse's Theorem becausesellections of the number i are events independent from each other.4) Deletion of the concept descriptions:In cases in that the value of the formula (8) is more than 0.9 when k = 0.9, the concept description(9) is deleted from the Concept Dictionary and remaining positive examples are asserted as concept-concept relation descriptions into the Concept Dictionary because most of the examples for thedescription are negative.5) Division of categoriesIn cases in that the value of the formula (8) is more than 0.9 when k = O. I, the category B is dividedin two in order to represent both a category satisfying the relation (9) and a category not satisfying therelation (9) and all concepts under the category B is reclassified into the two categories because werecognize that a) the number of examples are large enough for the estimation, and that b) the number ofnegative examples is too large to neglect.
Here if the divided two categories exist as sub-categories ofthe category B in the concept taxonomy, the classification is not necessary.6) Accumulation of preference knowledgeIn cases in that the value of the formula (8) is not more than 0.9 when k = O. I, the collected negativeexamples are translated to preference knowledge (for data structures and usages of preferenceknowledge, see Section 4).
From a debugging trace of a testing system, together with a negativeexample, a concept, a word or a pronumciation corresponding to the negative example and a conceptdescription more appropriate than the negative example must be also gained.
This information isrepresented by preterence knowdedge with the following format 03) and accumulated:(13) on <concept> I <word> I <pronunciation>give preference to<a-more-appropriate-concept-description>over<a-negative-example-of-.concept-description>.

We ~ay use Poisson distribution asan approximation to (12) if n is large.
However.
since n~ 3,000, it is realistic tocalculate the formula (12).2167) Clustering of concept-concept relation descriptionsConcept-concept relation descriptions remaining after all the above procedures are clustered by usingan optimal scaling or using DM-decomposition and a probability-based estimation and the gainedclusters are asserted as concept-category relation descriptions into the Concept Dictionary.
Theclustering algorithms are explained in detail in (Nakao 1988, Matsukawa 1989).8) Reconstruction f the concept taxonomyCategory-category relation descriptions are clustered and hierachized by using DM-decomposition andset-relation calculations in order to bundle the descriptions into higher level categories.
Thehierachization algorithm is explained in detail in (Matsukawa 1990a, 1990b, Yokola 1990).4 Preference KnowledgeAll concepts, categories and concept descriptions have an ID number called concept ID.
Knowledge forordering input ,sentence interpretations given by using the Concept Dictionary are represented by dataindividually expressing the order of the concept \[Ds that co-occur with each word pronunciation, word andconcept, respectively (preference knowledge).
We use the following three methods for ordering concept IDs:a) Linear lists of concept IDsb) Association lists of concept IDs and the concept IDs' preference valuec) Dbected graphs including arcs meaning preference relations between concept \[DsAs mentioned in section 3.3, modification of the Concept Dictionary is made based on feedbackinformation from tests performed by various kinds of processes in application systems (testing systems).Word sense selection and translation word candidates election are ones of these processes.
'When an outputanswer given by such a testing system is different from correct answers, the reason for the difference isanalyzod by viewing u'aces of processes of the system, and the Concept Dictionary and/or the preferenceknowledge ate/is modified.
After such modifications, the correct answers become able to be selected by usingthe Concept Dictionary and the preference knowledge.
For example, the word "suspend" has five senses, asshown in Figure 7.
If the concept-concept relation shown in (14) is input, only two out of the five sensesmatch the relation.
The two senses are shown in (15):(14) c#suspend --<object>'-" c#police_man(to suspend the policeman)(15) 04.2.2 --<object>~ c#police_man~ (~ .2.5 --<object>-" c~police_mansuspend ~ / c#(3cfe9b)_to_hang_something~ c#(OdbTOc )_to_prevent_ ftom_mking_.pan_in_a_team_for_a_d me217011.3.2 ((For_an_lntentional_Object)_to_Postpone_the Time_Point_of_Occurrence_(of_an_Event_Having_l a_Time_Point))\[<agent>: (Human_Beings) I (Organizations),<object>: (An_Event_Having a_Time_Point) \]04.2.2 ((For a-Prsn-or-An-rganizain)--Discharge-(Anther-Person-or-organizatin)(From-a_Role~?_Occupation) )\[<agent> :(Human_Beings) \[ (Organizations),<object>: (Human_Beings) I (Organizations),<source>: (Occupations) I (Roles in_Organizations) I (Organizations)\]O1.2.5 ( (For_an_In tentional_Object )_to_Cause_(A_Physical_Object)_to_Touch_l (Another_Physical_Object))\[<agent> : (Human_Beings) ,<object>: (Physical_Objects) ,<goal> : (Physical_Objects) \].....?....t---c#C3c fe9b)to_hang_something suspend ~ c#(0db70c)to_prevent_from_taking_pan_in_a_team_for_a_time \   -'---, c#(0dbT0b)to_put_o ff_or_stop_ for_a_piriod_of_time\ ~ c#(0dbT0 f3to_cause_a_rule_or_law_to_be_ for_a_time_no_longer_in_force\ ~---- .

The Five Senses of Word "suspend" and Their Concept DescriptionsIf we have preference knowledge on "c#police_man" as shown in (I 6), we can select only one sense out ofthe two senses, namely "c#(0dbT0c)to_prevent_from_taking_part_in_a_team_for_a-time.

For example,"c#bird" and "c#rabbit" have different preference knowledge as follows:218(17) ongive preference tocMly --<agmat>-" (intentional-Objects) ;overc~hop --<agent>-" (Animals) :o n c#rabbitgive preference toc~hop - -<agent>""  (An ima ls )  ;overc~tly --<agent>'-,' (IntcndonaJ-Objects) :By using this knowledge with the concept descriptions shown in Figure 8, Japanese sentences can beproperly translated, for example as shown in (18) (for a method for unification of concepts expressed bydifferent words or in different languages, ee (Miike 1990b, Tominaga 1991)):(18) a) TORt  - GA(abe)TOBU.

(a rabbit)Preference knowledge is collected not only through processings of word sense selection and translationword candidate selection, but also throiagh those of structual disambiguation, paraphrasing and the like.Therefore, the knowledge includes descriptions corresponding to lexical preference proposed by Ford,Bresnan and Kaplan for structual disambiguation (Ford Bresnan and Kaplan 1982).
Although such knowledgeprovides just a bias of interpretations of ambiguous tructures, the knowledge is indispensable fordeterministic sentence analysis without any knowledge about the discourse to be refered in order to use theprinciple of parsimony, the principle of a priori plausibility, etc.
(Crain and Steedman 1984, Hirst 1984).5 DiscussionConcept-category relations are similar to what are called selection restrictions.
However, the goal of thedevelopment of the Concept Dictionary is not to express word sense with minimum semantic markers uch asin (Katz and Fodor 1963).
What is important is to actualize a methodology for weeding out incorrect, toocoarse or useless concept descriptions by using them on various application systems.
For the purpose, wemay have redundant semantic markers (namely, categories) at the first stage and do have descriptions notincluding semantic markers (namely, concept-concept relation descriptions).2190 11.6.4 ((For_An_Event_Having A_Period_Or_A _Time_Point) To_Get_Out_Of_Time_Order_(At_Sorne_Time))\[<object>: (Events_HavinLA_Penod) ', (Events_Having.A_Time_Point) .

TheTranslation Word Candidates of Pronunciation "TOBU" and Their Concept Descriptions220We are compiling and improving the Concept Dictionary based on the results of many practical testsperformed by various application systems.
Actually, however, the number of the application systems we arcusing for testing dictionary data is only some dozen, and the functions we require the dictionary to fulfill arejust at the level of practical necessity for the systems.
In other words, compared with "the whole knowledge",the Concept Dictionary actually lacks various parts.
For example:1) Coverage of Concept Relations and Categories:a) Coverage of concept relations:The number of sentences in the EDR corpus is 1,000,000.
As mentioned above, we alsocreate example sentences for some concepts and we use categories to describe concept relations.However, the coverage of concept relations is incomplete.
The situation is similar to that ofordinary lexicography in that even if we had a very large corpus and aboundant lexicographers,they could never completely assign example sentences covering all kinds of word co-occurrences in all types of contextsb) Coverage of categories:Some categories are useful to describe concept relations, while other categories are not.
Sincethe Cost/performance of the implementation f useless categories i low, we do not implementsuch categories in the concept taxonomy.2) Granularity of ConceptsSince concepts, our representation primitives, are almost as fine as translation words' senses inbilingual dictionaries, it is impossible to implement knowledge including finer instances.a) Real world instances :From concept-concept relations, we can extract slots of a class in the real world.
For example,from the concept-concept relation shown in (19), we can extract slot "haveALid?"
of class"C#vessel" as shown in (20):(19) c#vessel --,cpart_of> u c#lid(20) C#vesselcanHaveSI0ts: (haveALid?
)film we use the notation Cyc uses (Lenat and Ouha 1989))However, we cannot extract some attributes of real world instances from concept relationdescriptions.
For example the value "yes" of the slot "have ALid?"
shown at (21) can never bedecided with the Concept Dictionary:(21) TheVesselOnTheDesklnFronlOfMeAtl :OOamOnMarch3rdln 199 IJSTinstanceOf: C#vesselhaveALid?
: yes221b) Distinction of pragmatic referents:Finer referents are used for describing pragmatic ambiguities of a sentence.
For example, inorder to express pragmatically different interpretations, different referents ate described intoeach mental space, according to Fauconnier's theory (Fauconnier 1984).
For example,different interpretations of the sentence (22) require at least three different mental spaces andsix different referents of the word "president".
(22) John believes that the president was a baby in 1929.The Concept Dictionary can not give distinction of such referents although it can give predicateconcepts used in annotations for mental spaces.?
