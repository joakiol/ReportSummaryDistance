ON MODES OF DEPINITE REFERENCE: AN APPLICATION TO THEINTERACTION WITH DATABASE SYSTEMSGenevieve Bsr~y-RoggheTemple Un ivers i ty ,  CI8 Department; 03824Ph i lade lph ia ,  PA 19122, U.S.A.Ident i fy ing  the re ferent  of a s ingu lar  de f in i te  term ina database query essent ia l l y  cons is ts  in  detemin ing  i t sextens ion  in  the database by app ly ing  the Ruass l l i an  t ru thcond i t ions  fo r  de f in i te  descr ip t ions .
However, most de f in i tedescr ip t ions  are " incomplete"  in  that  the descr ip t ion  i t se l fdoes not conta in  the un ique ly  spec i fy ing  cond i t ions  but i tshould be au~nented by features  der ived  from the s i tuat ion  ord i scourse  context .
Most work in  AI in  th i s  f ie ld  has con-cent ra ted  on how to de l imi t  the re levant  contextua l  features(see,  fo r  example, the work on anapho~o re ference  and focus -s ing  by Webber 78, S idner  77 and Grosz 76) .
This paperaddresses  cer ta in  aspects  of the theory  of de f in i te  re ferencewhich, though extens ive ly  t reated  in  the l i te ra ture  on lan -guage phi losophy,  have been ra ther  neg lec ted  in  the des ignof natura l  language process ing  systemae.Some of the ambigu i t ies  of de f in i te  re ference  der ivefrom the fac t  that  a de f in i te  descr ip t ion  may denote someunique ind iv idua l  in  the world sa t i s fy ing  the spec i f i ca t ionor  some ind iv idua l  the speaker has in  mind who may or may notco inc ide  wi th  the former ( ie  the " re ferent ia l "  versus  the, ,a t t r ib~t ive  n mode of re fe rence) .
Furthelqnore~ the speakermay in tend  the hearer  to in terpret  the rs fe~c l~ express ionin  e i ther  a "value laden" or a "value f ree"  mode (c f r  Ba~-wiee/Psx-~y 80) .
In  the former mode the sentence  i s  g iven- 32  -fa secondary in terpretat ion  by subst i tu t in~ in  i t  the ent i tyfu l f i l l i ng  the descr ip t ion .
This ra i ses  such i ssues  as towhether de f in i te  descr ip t ions  may be used to inform as we l las to refer (see Joshi 78).
The first part of the paperat tempts  to character i ze  the phenomena var ious ly  re fer red  toby such terms as in tens ion /extenston ,  de d i t to /de  re ,attrlbutlve/referentlal, value-free~value-laden...
Some ofthese phenomena re to be accounted fo r  on the semanticleve l  of representat ion  whereas others  are deemed to  belongto the pra~nat ic  leve l ,The second par t  of the paper examines which of themodes of de f in i te  re ference  d i s t ingu ished  in  paz~t I areman i fes ted  in  the in teract ion  with a database system and howthey can be recognized by the natuxa l  language in ter face .
Thes tandard  procedure fo r  de f in i te  re ference  ident i f i ca t ion  i sto exclude gener ic  and " in tens iona l "  uses;  to assume ident i tybetween the re ferent  the speaker be l ieves  fu l f i l l s  thedescr ip t ion  and the ac tua l  re fe rent  and to un i formly  imposea va lue - laden  in terpretat ion  mode, The fo l low ing  examplesi l l us t ra te  some other  modes of re fe rence  which should rece iveadequate t reatment  in  a natura l  language in ter face  extend ingi t s  cap ic i ty  beyond the mere re t r ieva l  of fac tua l  in fo rmat -ion .The gener ic  mode of re fe rence  i s  not always obv ious lyd i s t ingu ishab le  from the a t t r ibut ive  mode as shown by (1)and (2), reepectlvely~(1) How long is the flight from Boston to Chicago?
(2) How many passengers were on the flight fromBoston to Chicago?The semant ic  in terpreta t ion  of the de f in i te  a r t i c le  in(1) corresponds to the un iversa l  quant i f ie r  whereas Xn (2)i t  corresponds to the io ta -operator .
In  cont ras t  to the gen-e r i c  mode, a de f in i te  descr ip t ion  i s  used " in tena iona l ly"when the subst i tu t ion  of i t s  extens ion  in  ~he sentence maya l te r  the t ru th  va lue .
This i s  the case in  re ferent ia l l y- 33  -opaque contexts.
It hss been pointed out by Kaplan/Davidson81 that  cer ta in  update commands uch as (3) may be re ferent -ia l l y  opaque:(3) Change the teacher of CIS 234 to Dr. Smith.The difference between the attributive and the referent-ial uses, on the other hand, may be illustrated by the differ-ent replies (4a) end (4b), respectively, to query (4):(4) Is there a car parked under the big cherry tree?
(4a) No.
There is no cherry tree in the scene.
(4b) Yes.
But the tree you are referring to is an oak.In the referential mode of reference the hearer has anindependent way of identifying the referent, usually throughlocating him in time and space.
In this mode the descriptionserves a dual function of referring and of describing.
Thereferential mode is only likely to occur when interactingwith a database consisting of visual objects displayed on ascreen (as in the SRI and HAM-RPM projects).
In the attribut-ive mode the description refers to whichever entity fulfillsthe specification at a particular index.
The referential//attributive distinction is not to be explained as a scopeambigu i ty  (c f r  the re /de  d i t to  readings) but ra ther  bothread ings  should rece ive  the same semantic  in terpreta t ion ,  thed i s t inc t ion  being accounted fo r  on the pragmatic leve l  (seefu r ther ) .Of particular importance to natural language interactionin a system that ales at a high degree of "cooperativeness"is the distinction between the value-free and value-ladeninterpretation modes, from the point of view of the hearer.Consider the following alternative system replies (Sa) and(5h) to query (5).
In (Sa) the definite description wasvalue-laden, as is the standard practice, whereas the value--free interpretation indicated by (Sb) seems to be moreappropriate to the user's intentions:- 34  -(5 )  U: Does the head of the CIS department earn morethen the head of the Phi losophy department?S: YesU: Why?
(5a) S: Because Dr. Jones has more dependents thanDr.
Smith(Sb) S: Because computer sc ience  i s  bet te r  remuneratedthan ph i losophy ?In  order  to re t r ieve  the answer the extens ion  of  thedescr ip t ion  has to be determined in  both cases but in  (Sb)the ingred ients  of  the descr ip t ive  express ion  were re ta inedfor further processing.
This raises such pragmatic issues aswhy a speaker  chooses a par t i cu la r  descr ip t ion  to  re fe r  to  anent i ty  and what c lues  might guide the hearer  as to the in -tended in terpreta t ion  s t ra tbgy .The th i rd  par t  of  the paper g ives  an out l ine  on how toin terpret  these modes in  the system.
The approach taken i sthat  cer ta in  modes should be t reated  as pra~at io  phencaemara ther  than as semantic  ones.
A t the  semantic  leve l  a languageprocess ing  system should produce a context - independent  in ter -p re ta t ion  of  what a speaker  means by an u t te rance .
The prag-mat ic  leve l  dea ls  wi th  what the speaker  Intends the hearer  toimfer  from h is  u t te rance .
At the semantic  leve l  of  representat -ion the Russe l l i an  t ru th  cond i t ions  fo r  de f in i te  re fe rence  areapp l ied ,  where appropr ia te .
These determine the "semant icre fe rent"  which i s  de f ined  by the convent ions  of  the language;the "speaker ' s  re fe rent" ,  on the o ther  hand, i s  the ob jec twhich the speaker  be l ieves  fu l f i l l s  the cond i t ions  fo r  beingthe semantic re fe rent  (see Kripke 77).
This paper a t tempts  tospec i fy  the not ion  of  "speaker ' s  re fe rent"  in  terms of  re fe r -ence as a speech ac t .
For example, a cond i t ion  fo r  fe l i c i tousre fe rence  in  the re ferent ia l  mode i s  that  the speaker  be l ievesthat  the re ferent  sa t i s f ies  the descr ip t ion  and a l so  that  hebe l ieves  the hearer  be l ieves  In  the " Jus t i f i ca t ion"  fo r  thedescr ip t ion  (cf~ Cohen/Per rau l t  81) .
I t  wa l l  be shown that  in- 35  -cer ta in  contexts  de f in i te  re ference involves other speech actsbes ides  refezTlng such as informing, descr ib ing ,  exp la~ning .
