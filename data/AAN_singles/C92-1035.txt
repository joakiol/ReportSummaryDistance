CATEGORIAL SEMANTICS FOR LFGMary DalrympleXerox PARCPalo Alto, CA 94304 USAdalrymple@parc.xerox.com1 In t roduct ionA categorial semantics for Lexical-khmctionalGrammar provides a means for semantic inter-pretation of sentences of natural language that isappropriately constrained both syntactically andsemantically.
The f-structure of LFG provides across-lingnistically uniform format for represent-ing syntactic information; constraining a deriva-tion with respect o the f-structure rather thana phrase structure tree allows reference to rel-evant functional syntactic information withoutrequiring construction of a phrase structure treewhose form is (often dubiously) motivated on se-mantic grounds.
Additionally, a categorial se-mantics constrains emantic derivations appro-priately, obviating the need for an appeal to well-formedness conditions on the resulting semanticrepresentation.2 P rev ious  WorkMost semantic analyses appeal to syntactic on-straints on semantic derivations.
In particular,many analyses assume that such syntactic on-straints are statable in terms of phrase structuretree configurations (Montague, 1974).
However,it is well-known that a variety of phrase struc-ture configurations can express the same syn-tactic predicate-argunlent relations within andacross languages (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982);thus, syntactic constraints on semantic deriva-tions are better expressed at a level at which therelevant syntactic information is expressed moreuniformly.
Such a level is the f-structure of LFG.Halvorsen (1983) first provided a theory ofsemantic interpretation for LFG in which se-mantic interpretation rules are related to thef-structure.
His system involves an intermedi-ate level of representation, the 'semantic struc-ture', which is represented as a directed graph{like the f-structure).
Translation rules map fromf-structures to semantic structures, and thesestructures are then interpreted (or translatedinto a formula of intensional logic).The approach to be presented here also re-lies on f-structure configurations to provide syn-tactic constraints on categorial semantic deriva-tions.
However, an intermediate l vel of se-mantic representation such as Halvorsen's e-mantic structure is not introduced.
In the cat-egoriai semantic framework developed by Fer-nando Pereira (Pereira, 1990; Pereira and Pol-lack, 1991; Pereira, 1991), syntactic structuresare directly associated with interpretations (ortheir types), and syntactic onfigurations licensethe combination of these interpretations in a se-mantic derivation.
On this approach, 'logicalforms' are not viewed as manipulable syntacticobjects; instead, a logical formula is simply agraphical representation f a meaning that is lex-ically provided or that is the outcome of a seman-tically justified derivation.
In this, the approachdiffers from other recent approaches to seman-tic interpretation i LFG (Halvorsen and Kap-lan, 1988), in which the interpretation of an f-structure is represented as a directed graph, andsemantic derivation proceeds principally by uni-fication of semantic representations.
As a con-sequence, these approaches require constraintson semantic derivations to be stated as well-formedness conditions on semantic representa-tions, contrary to the commonly-held goal of dis-pensabihty of logical form.To illustrate a categorial semantic analysiswithin LFG, I will provide a small fragment ofsyntactic and semantic rules of English; the frag-ment contains rules for quantified noun phrases,nominal modification, and clauses headed bytransitive and intransitive verbs.
Many of theserules are modifications and extensions of rulesoriginally described in Pereira (1990), thoughPereira's system appeals to phrase structureconfigurations rather than f-structures to con-ACRES DE COLING-92.

1992strain semantic derivations; in part icular,  therules Pereira provides for quantifiers and rela-tive clauses have direct counterparts in the setof rules to be described below.3 Sentence  In terpreta t ionA sentence such as (1) has the interpretat iongiven in (2): 1(1) John crashed.
(2) crash (john)This interpretation is the outcome of a deriva-t ion according to a set of rules to be describedbelow.
Some of the rules must be licensed bypart icular  f-structure configurations, while someare unrestr icted in their apphcahihty.
Example1 has the following hstructure:(3) \[PRED ,crash (SUBJ) , 1\[SkrBJ \[PRED 'John'\]\]Annotated phrase structure rules hke the follow-ing are assumed: 2S ---, NP VP(T suBJ)=~ 1-VP -~ V (NP)T=~ (T oB~)=lNotice that these phrase structure rules encodeonly syntactic information.
No semantic infor-mat ion  or constraints are required.The lexical entries involved in the derivationof sentence (1) are:John NP (I PRED)= ' John'I~ = \[OP/\]crashed V (T PILED)= 'crash(suBJ}'(, TENSE) = PAST(T PRED)a : \[O \[- Ax.crash(z)\]The notat ion f~, stands for the interpretat ionof an f-structure f, often referred to as the se-mant ic  projection of f (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsenand Kaplan, 1988).
The interpretation for anyf-structure f is a sequent:1I will ignore tense and aspect in the representation fsentence meanings.2See Bresnan (1982) for an explication of the relationbetween c-structure and f-structure and the notation com-monly used to represent that relation.
(4) G : \ [o~-M\ ]The sequent '\[a ~ M\] '  is a pair consisting ofa set of assumptions a, somewhat analogous toa 'quantif ier store' (Cooper, 1983), and a ma-tr ix term M in which free variables introducedby the asstutlptions in a may occur (Pereira,1990; Pereira, 1991; Dalrymple et al, 1991).
Inthe following, I will speak of such expressions asintroducing the meaning M under the assump-tions in a.I assume a fixed order of appl icat ion of themeaning of a verb to its semantic arguments,with the order determined by the syntax (thoughthis assmnpt ion is not crucial to the analysis).Arguments are appl ied in the following order: s(1) Obliques(2) o,~2(3) osJ(4) sunJThe PILED of the f-structure of an active verbsuch as own will, then, be associated via the amapping with the following interpretat ion:(5) Ay.Ax.own(x,y)Notice that  the verb is required to combine withthe object first, and then the subject, in accor-dance with the argument ordering given above.\]:'or a passive verb, the ordering will be reversed.For the passive verb (be) owned, the order willbe:(6) x~.~v.ow,t(~,v)Here, the verb combines first with the obliqueby-phrase, then with the subject.The rule for interpret ing art f-structure for aclause headed by an intransit ive verb is: 4(7) Clause with intransi t ive verb:3This order of application was also proposed byDowry (1982), and is reminiscent of the obliqueness or-dering for arguments in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987).4This rule should apply when f has a PRED and a sUB J,but no other governable grammatical functions; it shouldnot apply if the verb is transitive and there is a slJl~J andan oB3, although f is unifiable with tile f-structure of atransitive verb as well as an intransitive one.
There areseveral ways of ensuring the needed result: the valence oftire verb can be reflected in its semantic type; f-structurescan be typed, with this rule applying only to intransitivef-structures (Zajac and Emele, 1990); or the PROD andits arguments can be separately specified, with the argu-marts of the PRED specified as a list which can be mntchedagainst, as in recent work by John Maxwell, Ron Kaplan,and others.ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOUT 1992 2 l 3 PROC.

The associated assumption set isthe union of the assmnptions from the PRED andthe SUna.
The f-structure for sentence 1 hcensesthe following derivation and provides the ex-pected meaning (under a null assumption set):(8) \['p RED f2:,craah (SUBJ) , Jks.., 'John'\]\]Lexically specified meanings:(f~)~ = \[0 ~- Ax.crash (~}\](fa),~ -- \[0 ~- j\]By rule 7:(fl)~ = \[0 U 0 l- Ax.erash(x) ( j ) \ ]= \[0 }- crash( j ) \ ]4 Quant i f i ca t ionSentence 9 contains a quantified noun phrase andhas the meaning represented in (10):(9) Every car crashed.

The followingschematic rule is necessary to interpret quanti-fied noun phrases:(12) Quantified noun phrase, preliminary ver-sion (handles unmodified nominals only):f \[svzc S \ ]  \]: \[PriED P \ ]S~ = \[as ~- ms\] IP,  = lap F- me\]f ~ - \[a s \[5 ap , quant (ms, x, rap) ~- 2\]The notation 'a, A' represents he set a plus thesingleton A.
By this rule, a quant assumption isadded to the assumption set for the noun phrase.The quant assmnption acts like an element in aCooper store, keeping together the informationassociated with the quantified noun phrase, msin the quant asstmlption is the meaning of thespecifier (here, every); z is the variable intro-duced by the quantifier as the meaning of thequantified norm phrase; and mp is the meaningof the PRED, which will form the first argumentof the generalized quantifier every when quan-tifier discharge takes place.
The derivation ofthe meaning of sentence 9 according to the rnlesgiven thus far proceeds as follows:fl : SPEC f4 : PROD 'every ~SUBJ f3 : L PREp f5 :'car'Lexically specified meanings:(f2L = \[0 W A~.crash (z/\]By rule 12, 'Quantified noun phrase':(In), = \[{quant (every, z, Ay.car(y))} W z\]By rule 7, 'Clause with intransitive verb':(kL  -\ [{q~ant  (,~ery,,, ~y.ear(y))} ~cry*h(,)\]According to these rules, the meaning for f-structure fl is a meaning under an assumptionabout the variable x.
The meaning of fl with-out assumptions i  obtained by discharging the(sole) quantifier assumption in the assumptionset.
The quantifier discharge rule relates a se-quent and a syntactic licensing environment to anew sequent:Acres DE COLING-92, NANT~.

The syntactic licensing environment isthe f-structure f. in this rule, f is lmeonstrained;there are no conditions on f. This means thatthe quantifier discharge rule has art unrestrictedsyntactic licensing condition.
A quantifier mayscope over any syntactic onstituent, as long asit is of the correct semantic type.
5To interpret sentence 9, diseh can now beapplied to the sequent (fl)~ associated with thef-structure \]1:disch (?, \[{quant(every, ~, )~y.car(y))} b crash(z:)\])= \[0 \]- every (Xy.car (y), Xx.crash(x))\]The result is the meaning of fl with all assump-tions discharged.
I will assume that what is gen-erally referred to as the 'meaning' of an utteranceis the meazfing obtained when all assumptionshave been discharged.In general, assumptions may be dischargedafter any application of a functor to an argument,as long as the syntactic enviromnent for assump-tion discharge has been met.
Thus, a predicateapply can be defined:(15) apply(f, \[a~ ~ Fun\], \[aA ~ Arg\]) d9discharge(I, \[aF UaA '- Fun (Avg)\])apply operates on sequents in a syntactic licens-ing environment f. discharge(f, S) is the re-sult of applying any number of discharge (disch)rules licensed by the syntactic onfiguration f toS.
(Note that apply is not a function, since theresult of apply depends on the Immber and thechoice of assumptions tobe discharged.)
By thisfunction application rule for sequents, then, themeaning of the fimctor is applied to the mean-ing of the argunlent; the union of the functorassumptions and the argmnent assumptions itaken; and some number of discharge rules maybe applied.
This definition of apply will be used~Here \[ will not discuss conditions on preferred scopesfor quantifiers ( uch as the tendency for the quantifiereach to outscope other quantifiers, or for quantifiers toscope inside the clause in which they appear).ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ho~r 1992 2 1 5in the tbllowing to apply predicates to their ar-guments and to permit subsequent assumptiondischarge.Given this new definition of apply, interpre-tation rule 7 for clauses headed by intransitiveverbs can be restated:(16) Clause with intransitive verb:The interpretation for an f-structure f, repre-senting an umnodified clause with an intransitiveverb, is obtained by applying the pREI) P to theSuBJ S in the syntactic heensing enviroltment f.In general, f~, will constitute an assignment of fto a sequent hat satisfies the constraints givenby the lexical entries and the rules of interpreta-tion.It should be noted that rule 16 is incompletein providing interpretations only for sentencesnot involving adverbial modification; an analy-sis of adverbials, though straightforward in thisframework, will not be provided here.5 Nomina l  modif icat ionRule 12 for tile interpretation f quantified normplLrases is incomplete, since it apphes only to un-modified nominals.

Se-mantically, the interpretation of a relative clauseis the property obtained when the position filledby the relative pronoun is abstracted out.
Forexample, here are some relative clauses with arough representation f their memfings:(19) a.
(the man) that I saw: Az.saw(1,~)b.
(the man) whose brother's ear I drove:A~.drove( I, z ' s brother's car)I assume that relative pronouns such as thator whose introduce a variable under a telassumption which is abstracted out in thecourse of the derivation.
The interpreta-tion of a relative clause is obtained by arule allowing the discharge of the rel as-sumption associated with the relative pro-noun (and possibly other assumptions as well):(20) Relative clause interpretation:\[TOPIC TOP\]f : \[REL R J ~ "f~ = discharge(f,R~)The tel discharge rule applies only under syntac-tically licensed conditions:(21) Relative clause assumption discharge:disch( f , \[aREL, tel(x) ~ RE L :t\]) =\[aRE L ~- Az.REL lConditions:\[TOPIC TOP\]f :  \[REL R \](/TOPIC GF* )=re lp :  \[PREDTypE a LJPRO\],elp~ = \[,el(x) ~ x:  e}The relative pronoun must appear in the frontedTOPIC constituent.
This is indicated in thesecond condition by the regular expressionTOPIC OF*; this expression involves functionaluncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988) and re-quires that the relative pronoun relp must ap-pear at the end of a path that is a member ofthe language described by the regular expres-tmn.
Here, the path expression does not con-strain where the relative pronoun may be foundwithin the fronted constituent (OF* is a sequenceof zero or more grammatical functions); a morecomplete syntactic analysis of relative clauseswould constrain the path appropriately.
The re-sult of the application of rule 21 is that the vari-able introduced by the relative pronoun is ab-stracted out.The value of the MOPS attribute is a set off-structures, interpreted according to the followingr ule:(22) The semantic value of a set off-structuresis the set of corresponding sequents.
If Fis a set of f-structures:F~--  { f~r fc  F}The rule for the interpretation ofquantified nounphrases with nominal modification is given inFigure 2.
According to this rule, the derivation ofthe meaning of a quantified noun phrase proceedsby introducing a variable (x in Figure 2) undera quant assumption, consisting of the meaningof the specifier of the noun phrase, the variable,and the quantifier estriction ILEST.Recall the definition of apply given in 15:(23) apply(f, jaR ~- Fun\], \[aA F- Arg\]) d~=ydischarge(f, \[aF U aA ~- Fun (Arg)})This definition will now be extended so apply cantake a set ofsequents as its argument.

Con-straining semantic derivations with respect o f-structures i preferable to the standard approachof using phrase structure trees, since f-structuresneed not be specifically tailored to solving the in-terpretation problem, but are motivated on inde-pendent grounds.
The categorial semantics rulespresented above provide an interpretation for f-structures directly, without the need for con-structing an intermediate l vel of 'logical form'.7 AcknowledgementsFor invaluable assistance, I am very grateful toFeruando Pereira and Stuart Shieber.
