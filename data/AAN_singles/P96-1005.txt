eduAbst ractThis paper deals with the discovery, rep-resentation, and use of lexical rules (LRs)during large-scale semi-automatic compu-tational lexicon acquisition.
The analy-sis is based on a set of LRs implementedand tested on the basis of Spanish andEnglish business- and finance-related cor-pora.
We show that, though the use ofLRs is justified, they do not come cost-free.
Semi-automatic output checking is re-quired, even with blocking and preemtionprocedures built in.
Nevertheless, large-scope LRs are justified because they facili-tate the unavoidable process of large-scalesemi-automatic lexical acquisition.
We alsoargue that the place of LRs in the compu-tational process is a complex issue.1 In t roduct ionThis paper deals with the discovery, representation,and use of lexical rules (LRs) in the process of large-scale semi-automatic computational lexicon acqui-sition.
LRs are viewed as a means to minimize theneed for costly lexicographic heuristics, to reduce thenumber of lexicon entry types, and generally to makethe acquisition process faster and cheaper.
Thefindings reported here have been implemented andtested on the basis of Spanish and English business-and finance-related corpora.The central idea of our approach - that thereare systematic paradigmatic meaning relations be-tween lexical items, such that, given an entry forone such item, other entries can be derived auto-mat ical ly-  is certainly not novel.
In modern times,it has been reintroduced into linguistic discourseby the Meaning-Text group in their work on lex-ical functions (see, for instance, (Mel'~uk, 1979).?

also of Purdue University NLPLab, W Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.It has been lately incorporated into computationallexicography in (Atkins, 1991), (Ostler and Atkins,1992), (Briscoe and Copestake, 1991), (Copestakeand Briscoe, 1992), (Briscoe et al, 1993)).Pustejovsky (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995) has coinedan attractive term to capture these phenomena: oneof the declared objectives of his 'generative lexi-con' is a departure from sense enumeration to sensederivation with the help of lexical rules.
The gen-erative lexicon provides a useful framework for po-tentially infinite sense modulation in specific con-texts (cf.
(Leech, 1981), (Cruse, 1986)), due totype coercion (e.g., (eustejovsky, 1993)) and simi-lar phenomena.
Most LRs in the generative lexi-con approach, however, have been proposed for smallclasses of words and explain such grammatical andsemantic shifts as +count to - count  or - commonto +common.While shifts and modulations are important, wefind that the main significance of LRs is theirpromise to aid the task of massive lexical acqui-sition.Section 2 below outlines the nature of LRs in ourapproach and their status in the computational pro-cess.
Section 3 presents a fully implemented casestudy, the morpho-semantic LRs.
Section 4 brieflyreviews the cost factors associated with LRs; theargument in it is based on another case study, theadjective-related LRs, which is especialy instructivesince it may mislead one into thinking thai.
LRs areunconditionally beneficial.2 Nature  o f  Lex ica l  Ru les2.1 Onto log ica l -Semant ic  BackgroundOur approach to NLP can be characterized asontology-driven semantics (see, e.g., (Nirenburg andLevin, 1992)).
The lexicon for which our LRs are in-troduced is intended to support the computationalspecification and use of text meaning representa-tions.
The lexical entries are quite complex, asthey must contain many different types of lexicalknowledge that may be used by specialist processesfor automatic text analysis or generation (see, e.g.,32(Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1995), for a detaileddescription).
The acquisition of such a lexicon, withor without he assistance of LRs, involves a substan-tial investment of time and resources.
The meaningof a lexical entry is encoded in a (lexieal) semanticrepresentation language (see, e.g., (Nirenburg et al,1992)) whose primitives are predominantly terms inan independently motivated world model, or ontol-ogy (see, e.g., (Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990) and(Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995)).The basic unit of the lexicon is a 'superentry,' onefor each citation form holds, irrespective of its lexi-cal class.
Word senses are called 'entries.'
The LRprocessor applies to all the word senses for a givensuperentry.
For example, p~vnunciar has (at least)two entries (one could be translated as "articulate"and one as "declare"); the LR generator, when ap=plied to the superentry, would produce (among oth-ers) two forms of pronunciacidn, derived from eachof those two senses/entries.The nature of the links in the lexicon to the ontol-ogy is critical to 'the entire issue of LRs.
Represen-tations of lexical meaning may be defined in termsof any number of ontological primitives, called con=cepts.
Any of the concepts in the ontology may beused (singly or in combination) in a lexical meaningrepresentation.No necessary correlation is expected between syn-tactic category and properties and semantic or onto-logical classification and properties (and here we def-initely part company with syntax-driven semantics-see, for example, (Levin, 1992), (Dorr, 1993) -prettymuch along the lines established in (Nirenburg andLevin, 1992).
For example, although meanings ofmany verbs are represented through reference to on-tological EVENTs and a number of nouns are rep-resented by concepts from the OBJECT sublattice~frequently nominal meanings refer to EVENTs andverbal meanings to OBJECTs.
Many LRs produceentries in which the syntactic ategory of the inputform is changed; however, in our model, the seman-tic category is preserved in many of these LRs.
Forexample, the verb destroy may be represented byan EVENT, as will the noun destruction (naturally,with a different linking in the syntax-semantics n-terface).
Similarly, destroyer (as a person) wouldbe represented using the same event with the addi-tion of a HUMAN as a filler of the agent case role.This built-in transcategoriality strongly facilitatesapplications such as interlingual MT, as it rendersvacuous many problems connected with categorymismatches (Kameyama et al, 1991) and misalign-ments or divergences (Dorr, 1995), (Held, 1993) thatplague those paradigms in MT which do not rely onextracting language-neutral text meaning represen-tations.
This transcategoriality is supported by LRs.2.2 Approaches to LRs and  The i r  TypesIn reviewing the theoretical and computational lin-guistics literature on LRs, one notices a number ofdifferent delimitations ofLRs from morphology, syn-tax, lexicon, and processing.
Below we list threeparameters which highlight he possible differencesamong approaches to LRs.2.2.1 Scope of PhenomenaDepending on the paradigm or approach, there arephenomena which may be more-or less-appropriatefor treatment by LRs than by syntactic transfor-mations, lexical enumeration, or other mechanisms.LRs offer greater generality and productivity at theexpense of overgeneration, i.e., suggesting inappro-priate forms which need to be weeded out before ac-tual inclusion in a lexicon.
The following phenomenaseem to be appropriate for treatment with LRs:?
Inflected Forms- Specifically, those inflectionalphenomena which accompany changes in sub-categorization frame (passivization, dative al-ternation, etc.).?
Word Formation- The production of derivedforms by LR is illustrated in a case study be-low, and includes formation of deverbal nom-inals (destruction, running), agentive nouns(catcher).
Typically involving a shift in syn-tactic category, these LRs are often less pro-ductive than inflection-oriented ones.
Conse-quently, derivational LRs are even more proneto overgeneration than inflectional LRs.?
Regular Polysemy - This set of phenomenaincludes regular polysemies or regular non-metaphoric and non-metonymic alternationssuch as those described in (Apresjan, 1974),(Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995), (Ostler and htkins,1992) and others.2.2.2 When Should LRs Be Appl ied?Once LRs are defined in a computational scenario,a decision is required about the time of applicationof those rules.
In a particular system, LRs can beapplied at acquisition time, at lexicon load time andat run time.?
Acquisition Time - The major advantage of thisstrategy is that the results of any LR expansioncan be checked by the lexicon acquirer, thoughat the cost of substantial additional time.
Evenwith the best left-hand side (LHS) conditions(see below), the lexicon acquirer may be floodedby new lexical entries to validate.
During the re-view process, the lexicographer can accept thegenerated form, reject it as inappropriate, ormake minor modifications.
If the LR is beingused to build the lexicon up from scratch, thenmechanisms used by Ostler and Atkins (Ostlerand Atkins, 1992) or (Briscoe et al, 1995), suchas blocking or preemption, are not available as33automatic mechanisms for avoiding overgenera-tion.?
Lexicon Load Time - The LRs can be appliedto the base lexicon at the time the lexicon isloaded into the computational system.
As withrun-time loading, the risk is that overgenera-tion will cause more degradation in accuracythan the missing (derived) forms if the LRs werenot applied in the first place.
If the LR inven-tory approach is used or if the LHS constraintsare very good (see below), then the overgener-ation penalty is minimized, and the advantageof a large run-time lexicon is combined with ef-ficiency in look-up and disk savings.?
Run Time - Application of LRs at run timeraises additional difficulties by not supportingan index of all the head forms to be used by thesyntactic and semantic processes.
For example,if there is an Lit which produces abusive-adj2from abuse-v1, the adjectival form will be un-known to the syntactic parser, and its produc-tion would only be triggered by failure recoverymechanisms - -  if direct lookup failed and thereverse morphological process identified abuse-vl as a potential source of the entry needed.A hybrid scenario of LR use is also plausible,where, for example, LRs apply at acquisition time toproduce new lexical entries, but may also be avail-able at run time as an error recovery strategy toattempt generation of a form or word sense not al-ready found in the lexicon.2.2.3 LR Triggering ConditionsFor any of the Lit application opportunities item-ized above, a methodology needs to be developedfor the selection of the subset of LRs which are ap-plicable to a given lexical entry (whether base orderived).
Otherwise, the Lits will grossly overgen-erate, resulting in inappropriate ntries, computa-tional inefficiency, and degradation of accuracy.
Twoapproaches suggest hemselves.?
Lit Itemization - The simplest mechanism ofrule triggering is to include in each lexicon en-try an explicit list of applicable rules.
LR ap-plication can be chained, so that the rule chainsare expanded, either statically, in the speci-fication, or dynamically, at application time.This approach avoids any inappropriate appli-cation of the rules (overgeneration), though atthe expense of tedious work at lexicon acquisi-tion time.
One drawback of this strategy is thatif a new LR is added, each lexical entry needsto be revisited and possibly updated.?
Itule LIIS Constraints - The other approach isto maintain a bank of LRs, and rely on theirLHSs to constrairi the application of the rules toonly the appropriate cases; in practice, however,it is difficult to set up the constraints in such away as to avoid over- or undergeneration a pri-or~.
Additionally, this approach (at least, whenapplied after acquisition time) does not allowexplicit ordering of word senses, a practice pre-ferred by many lexicographers to indicate rela-tive frequency or salience; this sort of informa-tion can be captured by other mechanisms (e.g.,using frequency-of-occurrence statistics).
Thisapproach does, however, capture the paradig-matic generalization that is represented by therule, and simplifies lexical acquisition.3 Morpho-Semant ics  andConst ruct ive  Der ivat iona lMorpho logy :  a T ranscategor ia lApproach  to  Lex ica l  Ru lesIn this section, we present a case study of LRs basedon constructive derivational morphology.
Such LRsautomatically produce word forms which are poly-semous, such as the Spanish generador 'generator,'either the artifact or someone who generates.
TheLRs have been tested in a real world application, in-volving the semi-automatic a quisition of a Spanishcomputational lexicon of about 35,000 word senses.We accelerated the process of lexical acquisition 1by developing morpho-semantic LRs which, whenapplied to a lexeme, produced an average of 25 newcandidate entries.
Figure 1 below illustrates theoverall process of generating new entries from a ci-tation form, by applying morpho-semantic LRs.Generation of new entries usually starts withverbs.
Each verb found in the corpora is submittedto the morpho-semantic generator which producesall its morphological derivations and, based on a de-tailed set of tested heuristics, attaches to each forman appropriate semantic LR.
label, for instance, thenominal form comprador will be among the ones gen-erated from the verb comprar and the semantic LR"agent-of" is attached to it.
The mechanism of ruleapplication is illustrated below.The form list generated by the morpho-semanticgenerator is checked against three MRDs (CollinsSpanish-English, Simon and Schuster Spanish-English, and Larousse Spanish) and the forms foundin them are submitted to the acquisition process.However, forms not found in the dictionaries are notdiscarded outright because the MRDs cannot be as-sumed to be complete and some of these ":rejected"forms can, in fact, be found in corpora or in theinput text of an application system.
This mecha-nism works because we rely on linguistic clues anda See (Viegas and Nirenburg, 1995) for the details onthe acquisition process to build the core Spanish lexicon,and (Viegas and Beale, 1996) for the details oil the con-ceptual and technological tools used to check the qualityof the lexicon.34verb  l ist  f i le:  coznpr~.r con~r?:~:.-.-:.~;~::::~:,::.~.

2The acquirer must check the definition and enteran example, but the rest of the information is sim-ply retained.
The LEXical-RUT.~.S zone specifies themorpho-semantic rule which was applied to producethis new entry and the verb it has been applied to.The morpho-semantic generator produces all pre-dictable morphonological derivations with theirmorpho-lexico-semantic associations, using threemajor sources of clues: 1) word-forms with their cor-responding morpho-semantic classification; 2) stemalternations and 3) construction mechanisms.
Thepatterns of attachement include unification, concate-nation and output rules 3.
For instance beber can be2We used the typed feature structures (tfs) as de-scribed in (Pollard and Sag, 1997).
We do not illustrateinheritance of information across partial lexical entries.3The derivation of stem alternations i beyond thederived into beb{e\]dero, bebe\[e\]dor, beb\[i\]do, beb\[i\]da,volver into vuelto, and communiear into telecommu-nicac\[on, etc... All affixes are assigned semantic fea-tures.
For instance, the morpho-semantic rule LRpo-larity_negative is at least attached to all verbs belong-ing to the -Aa class of Spanish verbs, whose initialstem is of the form 'con', 'tra', or 'fir' with the corre-sponding allomorph .in attached to it (inconlrolable,inlratable, ...  ).Figure 4 below, shows tlle derivational morphol-ogy output for eomprar, with the associated lexicalrules which are later used to actually generate theentries.
Lexical rules 4 were applied to 1056 verbcitation forms with 1263 senses among them.
Therules helped acquire an average of 25 candidate newentries per verb sense, thus producing a total of31,680 candidate ntries.From the 26 different citation forms shown in Fig-ure 4, only 9 forms (see Figure 5), featuring 16 newentries, have been accepted after checking.
5For instance, comprable, adj, LR3feasibility-allribulel, is morphologically derived from comprar,scope of this paper, and is discussed in (Viegas et al,1996).4We developed about a hundred morpho-semanticrules, described in (Viegas et al, 1996).5The results of the derivational morphology programoutput are checked against, existing corpora and dictio-naries, automatically.35"compra-N1cat:dfn:ex:admin:syn:sere:lex-rul:Vacquire  the  possess ion  or  r ightby pay ing or p romis ing  to payLR2event  "11 /12  20:33:02" \[ oo,buy\]comprar -V l  "LR2event"Figure 3: Partial Entry for the Spanish lexical itemcompra generated automatically.and adds to the semantics of comprar the shade ofmeaning of possibility.In this example no forms rejected by the dic-tionaries were found in the corpora, and thereforethere was no reason to generate these new entries.However, the citation forms supercompra, precom-pra, precomprado, autocomprar actually appeared inother corpora, so that entries for them could be gen-erated automatically at run time.4 The  Cost  of  Lex ica l  Ru lesIt is clear by now that LRs are most useful in large-scale acquisition.
In the process of Spanish acquisi-tion, 20% of all entries were created from scratch byH-level lexicographers and 80% were generated byLRs and checked by research associates.
It shouldbe made equally clear, however, that the use of LRsis not cost-free.
Besides the effort of discoveriug andimplementing them, there is also the significant imeand effort expenditure on the procedure of semi-automatic hecking of the results of the applicationof LRs to the basic entries, such as those for theverbs.The shifts and modulations tudied in the litera-ture in connection with the LRs and generative lex-icon have also been shown to be not problem-free:sometimes the generation processes are blocked-orpreempted-for a variety of lexical, semantic andother reasons (see (Ostler and Atkins, 1992)).
Infact, the study of blocking processes, their view assystemic rather than just a bunch of exceptions, isby itself an interesting enterprise (see (Briscoe et al,1995)).Obviously, similar problems occur in real-lifelarge-scale lexical rules as well.
Even the most seem-ingly regular processes do not typically go throughin 100% of all cases.

Theacquisition of adjectives in general (see (Raskin andNirenburg, 1995)) results in the discovery and ap-plication of several arge-scope lexical rules, and itappears that no exceptions should be expected.
Ta-ble 1 illustrates examples of LRs discovered and usedin adjective ntries.The first three and the last rule are truly large-scope rules.
Out of these, the -able rule seems to bethe most homogeneous and 'error-proof.'
Around300 English adjectives out of the 6,000 or so, whichoccur in the intersection of LDOCE and the 1987-89Wall Street Journal corpora, end in -able.About 87% of all the -able adjectives are like read-able: they mean, basically, something that can beread.
In other words, they typically modify the nounwhich is the theme (or beneficiary, if animate) of theverb from which the adjective is derived:One can read the book.-The book is readable.The temptation to mark all the verbs as capableof assuming the suffix -able (or -ible) and formingadjectives with this type of meaning is strong, but itcannot be done because of various forms of blockingor preemption.
Verbs like kill, relate, or necessitatedo not form such adjectives comfortably or at all.Adjectives like audible or legible do conform to theformula above, but they are derived, as it were, fromsuppletive verbs, hear and read, respectively.
Moredistressingly, however, a complete acquisition pro-cess for these adjectives uncovers 17 different com-binations of semantic roles for the nouns modifiedby the -ble adjectives, involving, besides the "stan-dard" theme or beneficiary roles, the agent, experi-encer, location, and even the entire event expressedby the verb.
It is true that some of these combi-nations are extremely rare (e.g.
perishable), and alltogether they account for under 40 adjectives.
Thepoint remains, however, that each case has to bechecked manually (well, semi-automatically, becausethe same tools that we have developed for acquisi-tion are used in checking), so that the exact meaningof the derived adjective with regard to that of theverb itself is determined.
It turns out also that, for apolysemous verb, the adjective does not necessarilyinherit all its meanings (e.g., perishable again).5 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have discussed several aspects ofthe discovery, representation, and implementation fLRs, where, we believe, they count, namely, in theactual process of developing a realistic-size, real-lifeNLP system.
Our LRs tend to be large-scope rules,which saves us a lot of time and effort on massivelexical acquisition.Research reported in this paper has exhibited afiner grain size of description of morphemic seman-tics by recognizing more meaning components ofnon-root morphemes than usually acknowledged.The reported research concentrated on lexicalrules for derivational morphology.
The same mecha-nism has been shown, in small-scale xperiments, towork for other kinds of lexical regularities, notablycases of regular polysemy (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins,1992), (Apresjan, 1974)).Our treatment of transcategoriality allows for alexicon superentry to contain senses which are notsimply enumerated.
The set of entries in a superen-try can be seen as an hierarchy of a few "original"senses and a number of senses derived from themaccording to well-defined rules.
Thus, the argumentbetween the sense-enumeration and sense-derivationschools in computational lexicography may be shownto be of less importance than suggested by recent lit-erature.Our lexical rules are quite different from the lex-ical rules used in lexical\]y-based grammars (such as(GPSG, (Gazdar et al, 1985) or sign-based theories(HPSG, (Pollard and Sag, 1987)), as the latter canrather be viewed as linking rules and often deal withissues such as subcategorization.The issue of when to apply the lexical rules in acomputational environment is relatively new.
Morestudies must be made to determine the most bene-ficial place of LRs in a computational process.Finally, it is also clear that each LR comes at a cer-tain human-labor and computational expense, and ifthe applicability, or "payload," of a rule is limited,its use may not be worth the extra effort.
We cannotsay at this point that LRs provide any advantagesin computation or quality of the deliverables.
