A PROGRESS REPORT ONTHE USE OF  SLANT GRAMMAR CALCULUS FORAUTOMATIC  ANALYS ISFerenc  K ie ferThe KVAL-approach  to syntact i c  ana lys i s  has  been  basedon categor ia l  g rammar  as  propounded by Bar -H i l l e l  and Lambek.It was  c lear  at the very  outset  that the or ig ina l  fo rm of ca tegor ia lg rammar  is  not su i tab le  fo r  the purpose  of automat i zed  syntact i cana lys i s  in p ract i ce .
The f i r s t  a t tempts  at deve lop ing  a moreadequate  notat ion  as  wel l  as  at the c loser  examinat ion  of var iousproper t ies  of ca tegor ia l  g rammar  go back  to 1965 and 1966/KVAL  PM Z37, 248, 298, 302/ .
In o rder  to d i s t ingu ish  ourapproach  f rom or ig ina l  ca tegor ica l  g rammar  we have  te rmed itslant g rammar  calculus.Our  practical concern has been to write a grammar  forSwedish nominal phrases which would enable us to automatizesome linguistic aspects of documentation research.
Such a gram-mar  has been compiled by Bengt Svensson.
The rules utilizelexical andd morphological information.
In other words, no strictline is d rawn between morphological and syntactic rules.
A sub-stantial part of this preliminary grammar  has already beenchecked generatively by means  of a special string processinga lgor i thm /STR IP / .As  known one of the most  tedious prob lems in connect ionwith  categor ia l  g rammar  is  the great  number  of categor iesass ignab le  to most  "of the un i ts  in  the s t r ing  to be ana lyzed .
Th isis  a par  exce l lence  :p ract i ca l  p rob lem but i t  does  not  lack  theor -e t i ca l  imp l i ca t ions .
The most  in teres t ing  of these  can  be rough lyphrased  as  fo l lows :  If syntax  is  to be kept  as  s imp le  as  poss ib le ,then  the lex icon  wi l l  get  compl i ca ted .
If we a im at  the opt ima ls imp l i f i ca t ion  of the lex icon ,  then  the burden  of our  g rammarwi l l  be taken  over  by  syntax .
(Reca l l  that  in  categor ia l  g rammarwe have  on ly two ru les  fo r  the b id i rec t iona l  case .
There fore ,  a l lposs ib le  syntact i c  funct ions  fo r  each  lex ica l  ent ry  must  be l i s tedin the lex icon . )
Now we may ask  quest ions  about  the opt ima ld i s t r ibut ion  of tasks  of a g rammar  between syntax  and lex icon  ino rder  to ach ieve  an overa l l  s imp l i f i ca t ion  in g rammat ica l  descr ip -t ion.
(Not i ce  that  the same quest ion  can  be asked  wi th  respect  tosyntax  and semant ics ,  or  st i l l  bet te r ,  w i th  respect  to syntax ,  se -mant ics  and the lex icon . )
Th is  p rob lem has ,  of course ,  not  yetbeen  so lved  and consequent ly ,  one is  fo rced  to work  in genera lw i th  severa l  a l te rnat ives .On the o ther  hand,  one can neg lec t  th i s  theoret i ca l  i ssuePand concent ra te  on s t ra teg ies  that  would lead  to an essent ia l  re -duct ion  of the poss ib le  ambigu i t ies  fo r  a g iven  s t r ing .
Some pro -posa ls  to th is  e f fec t  can be found in KVALPM 327 and 373.
Oneof these  s t ra teg ies  fo l lows  the usua l  path :  the po int  i s  being madethat  the  es tab l i shment  of  the  cor rec t  syntact i c  s t ruc ture  /o r  s t ruc -tu res /  shou ld  be  car r ied  out  in  severa l  /a t  leas t  two/  s teps .Thus ,  ins tead  of  hav ing  ru les  of  the  fo rma/b  b -~ a/i/a a \b  -~ bwe wr i te  ru les  l i ke/Z /  x o y -~ zwh ich  may mean eitherZ/X  X -~ ZorX X\  Z -* Zi n / z /  we neglect the dominance relation / see  below/ hold-ing between the  two  const i tuents  and  a l so  the i r  l i near  o rder .
Forthe  la t te r  po in t  not i ce  that  /Z /  cor responds  to  two  phrase  s t ruc ture -type  ru les :z ~ a+b/3 /z ~ b + awhere  + s tands  fo r  concatenat ion .As  to  the  dominance  re la t ion  i t  s tands  to  reason  to in terpretz /x  in  a s t r ing  z /x  x as  be ing  the  head  or  governor  of  the  cons -t ruc t ion .
S imi la r ly ,  fo r  a s t r ing  x x \ z we  wou ld  say  that  xi s  governed  by  x I z .
In  v iew of  the  way  the  cance l la t ion  ru les  ofthe  s lant  g r&mmar  ca lcu lus  a re  bu i l t  up  we may say  that  the"more  complex"  or  " longer"  category  i s  the governor  of a g ivenexpress ion .
Th is  in fo rmat ion  is  c lear ly  los t  in  /2 / .However ,  as  spec i f ied  in In ter im Repor t  No | I ,  we are  notforced to make  this interpretation.
The slant calculus as suchl ends  i t se l f  to phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  too, context - f ree  orcontext -  sens i t i ve .Instead of / l /  our g rammar  would now contain a set ofs ta tements  of the fo rm /Z / :a I o b I = c 1/4 /  a z o b z : c z, .
*a o b c n n nEach  s ta tement  in /4/ cor responds  to a syntagm type in the g ivengrammar .
Of course ,  i t  i s  not  necessary  to have  b inary  ru lesonly .
One might  a l so  havea I o a 2 o .

am = c le tcNow a s t r ing  of ca tegor ies  in  te rms of our  s lant  g rammarca lcu lus  can  cance l  to a "s imp ler"  ca tegory  if, and on ly  if,  one ofthe ru le  schemata  in /4 /  ho lds .
But  ~t se t  of such  schemata  wi l ly ie ld  many d i f fe rent  categor ia l  g rammars ,  vary ing  as  to the in ter -p re ta t ion  of dependency ,With the he lp  of /4 /  one can determine  a sor t  of "deep"s t ruc ture  fo r  a g iven  sequence  of morphemes .4Af ter  hav ing determined  th is  deep  s t ruc ture  we can proceedby f ind ing out more  about  the actua l  s t ruc ture .Another  approach  cons is ts  of combin ing  the a forement ionedmul t i - l eve l  method  with probab i l i s t i c  cons iderat ions .
For  deta i l ssee  KVAL  In ter im Repor t  No 12.S ince  we have in terpreted  categor ies  in te rms of dependenc iesit is  read i ly  seen  that s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  can be cons ideredas a dependency- type  grammar .
The dependency  s ta tement  fo r  theru les  /1 /  can be rendered  as  /5 / :a/b (~ \[b\]).a\b  ( \ [a \ ]  x )We fu l ly  subscr ibe  to the v iew that  the determinat ion  of thehead  or  governor  of a const ruct ion  is  an impor tant  and ind ispensab letask .
/See ,  a lso ,  Jane  Rob inson/  There fore ,  we think that  depend-ency  grammar  in whatever  notat iona l  convent ions  it is  expressed ,is  super io r  to phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar .
Jane  Rob inson  has  ar -gued that  many t rans format ions  need  a re ference  to the head  ofconst ruct ion  wh ich  in usua l  phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  can only  beProv ided  by some ad hoc dev ice .
Al l  cons iderat ions  wi th  respect  todependency  grammar  hold  wi th  equal  fo rce  wi th  respect  to s lantgrammar  calculus.
The  latter can be used as a base for transform-ations in the same way as dependency grammar  can.
FollowingRobinson we may make use of the following notational concentionsthat differentiate dependency structures f rom phrase structures:we  may use asterisks to mark  governing occurrences, parenthesesto mark  boundaries and a special pair of symbols /labels/, de-noting a variable depth of nesting.
For  example,(A* B ~() => 2 I 31 2 3.
In o ther  words ,  the t rans format ion  rule app l ies  to a fami ly  oft rees  w i th  the s t ruc tureA/e /~, \  X i S`` ./" ", / s  ?

whether they denote categories characteristic of depend-ency grammar  or of slant g rammar  calculus.
We can thus conceiveof a grammar  that has as its base /"categorial component" /  a de-pendency-tTpe grammar  which is context-free and a transformationalcomponent  that operates on structures generated by  the categorial- - - - .

In th is  case  we can expect  f rom s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lusa notat iona l  advantage  at best .In fact ,  th is  seems to be the case .
Thus ,  in  many casesone can take advantage  of the resemblance  between categor ies  ofthe s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  and ord inary  f rac t ions .
Under  cer ta incond i t ions  we can determine  the type of syntagm by ass ign ing  toeach  symbo l  in the sequence  of ca tegor ies  a pr ime number  andthen car ry  out the cance l la t ion  in an ar i thmet ica l  sense .
Then,sequences  of ca tegory  symbo ls  in  the s lant  g rammar  ca lcu lus  caneas i ly  be hand led  wi thout  any  re ference  to the i r  mean ings .
Severa lp roposa ls  have  been  worked  out that  take advantage  of exact lyth is  t ra i t  /KVAL  PM 367/ .
