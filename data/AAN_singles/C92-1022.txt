45D-7030 B fb l ingen1 Int roduct ionRobustness is a formal behaviour of naturallangatage grammars to assign a best partialdescription to linguistic events wltose strongdescription is inconsistent or cannot be con-structed.
Events of this sort may be called de-fective with respect o a grammar fragment.Defectiveness arises from the performance usethat hnman beings make of language.
Since de-fectiveness can be seen as failure of linguisticdescription, the principal way to robustness ia method to weaken these descriptions.Robust parsing, then, is parsing of robustgranmmrs: a parser is robust iff it has the ca-pabillty to interpret weak grammar fraKmentscorrectly.
In this paper, I shall try to substan-tiate this claim by motivating a grammar de-pendent approach to robust parsing and thendescribing a chart parsing nlgoritbra for ro~bust g .

Though only c(ontext) f(ree)grammars will be adressed, there is an obvi-ous extension of the algorithm to annotated(unification-) grammars (WACSG formalism,see Goeser 1900) along the lines of (Shieber198~).Grammar based robustness tools have beenexplored in a variety of formalisms, e.g.
themetarule device within the ATN formalism(Weischedel and Sondheimer 1898), entity datastructures in a case frame approach (Hayes1984) or the weak description approach in uni-fication based grammars (Kudo et al 1988,Goeser 1990).
Parsing cf grammars with ro-?The work reported has been done while the authorreceived an LGF grnnt at the University of Stuttgart.bustness features competes with algorithnficapproaches to robustness where parsing al-gorithms, (usually chart parsers except inTomabechi and Tomita (1988) where LR(k)parsing is advocated) are extended to in-elude robustness features (Mellish 1989, Long1988) and/or heuristics to handle defect cases(Banger 1990, Stock et al 1988).Maybe the most critical issue in robust parsingis ambigatity, which emerges when constituencyis loosened to some cf substring analysis.

Even in a non-worst cast, whichshould be the case of realistic cfgs, local am-biguities from substring analysis massively in-crease parsing time.

Obviously, there is syntactic defectivitywhich is syntactically nonregalar, such as cor-raq~ted output from a speech recognition de-vice (Tomabechi and Tomita 1988) ~ or globalconstituent breaks (Goeser 1991), which canbe subjected to syntactic prefix analysis only.On the other hand, there are spoken languageconstructions (Lindgren 1987, Goeser 1991,Langer 1990) and various kinds of "fragmen-tary utterances" (Cnrbonell and ltnyes 1983)that definitively show configurational proper-ties.Let us look at ~ frequent spoken language con-struction called restart, as in the Germml co lpus exmnple (2) ~.

Thoughfinite cfls are turned into infinite ones throughRPSG indexing, the syntactic description withRPSG is still configurational up to certain localadjnrtctiorts.3 Bas ic  a lgor i thmAs a parsing algorithm to start from, Earley's(1971) chart parser has been chosen, whichh~-s a top-down component adaptable to thetop-down percolation ofirtdex infornmtion, andwhich guarantees a worst case complexity ofO(n ~) even for mnaximal mbiguity.
We use thedeclarative Earley variant in D/irre (1987).
Fora cfg G = < Cat, Lex, P, ,qset >, where Cat is aset of non-terminals, Lez a set of terminals, Pa set of rules and ,qset a set of start symbols,it is charact,;ri~ed by the fonowing predictorconcept:* the predictor is a relation D(i ,A)  Cn + x C, al between a vertex i < n anda rtort-termirtal .,4.
It is integrated intothe completer and scanner components(see below), Tlfis has the advantage thatno cyclic items i.e.
items with an emptystring of parsed symbols, have to be as-serted to the chart.

Then ev-ery item in the chart may be characterized bythe following membership condition 6 whichrespects both top-down (TD) and bottom-up(BU) information.
Remark that for the (ba-sis variant of the) Earley algorithm, while itemnrembership depends on top-down predictor in-formation, the acceptance of inpnt strings isindependent of the predictor (Kilbury 1985).A- -~.B  c C, hortli, j\] iff~Jec DSrre 198'T\[TD \] ~SE Sset S -*~ wO'~A~ A\[BU \] ~ ~ ~,-~where ~5 ~ V ~4 The  RPSG var iant4.1 I tem Concepth~ the RPSG variant, items are represertted asPROLOG factsitem( lumber, Lind, Rirtd, LRS,Pazsod, To_Parso~ RofList)where item number, the -possibly indexed- lefthand symbol, the list of parsed symbols andthe list of symbols yet to parse are well-knownitem parts.

\]hacontrast to the basis variant, however, a nullpredictor would be incorrect for the RPSGvariant, since the acceptance of a str ing nowdepends on the substr ing information perco-lated by lhc predictor.
The.
first predictorclause allows an "initialisation" for every ver-tex.
The second clause formulates the expecta-tion of a non-terminal A, I by an active item i.e.an item with a nonempty llst To-Parse, and thetltird the expectation by passive items with aSET index.
Clause 4 expects a start synd)ol onthe basis of left adjunction to a SET indexedsymbol.
The following proposition, a proof ofwbid~ is available from the anthor,  states thecorrectness of this predictor formalization..?en * ( S, ,o "'~ A,~g ) = 1 iff D ( i, A,, )for a S E Sseti,,,l4.~ The  CompleterThe completer component integrates the pre-dictor relation and the substr ing generationfunction and has two rules for rightside and~see Appendix A for a complete formal characteri-t~ation of the RPSG chart parserleftside mljunction under a set-indexed sym-bol.
Given that the conditions in the if-clause(and the lookahead condition, see below) yield,tlte completer adds new items to the chart 9Clansc I of the RPSG completer, is, up tothe generation function instead of derivation,equivalent to the completer of the basis vari-t~nt: Given a rightslde passive item, it adds anew item both for a matching active item andfor the prediction of an appropriate rules's LtlSsymbol.
Tltus, no cyclic items have to be cre-ated.
Furthermore, since RPSGs do not haveproductions, there is no need to handle cyclicitems at all.
Clause 2 does riglitsld- ndjnnc-lion of a start symbol i tem to a passive SETindexed item.

A partial  looks-head of 1, being applied to active items only,has proven advantageous in the basic variant(DSrre 1987).

AUtL 23-28, 1992bol, there is no first derivable lexical item, thatis accessible given the actual substring infor-mation.Unfortunately, the scanner is not independentfrom this lookahead, since, in many cases, theitem licensed by a lookahead operation ontoo lexical item i is exactly the item licensing iwithin the predictor elation.
That is, from aprocedural viewpoint of enterlng items into thechart, the lookahead condition and the predic-tor block each other for certain lcxical items.In this situation we decided to have a scannerwithout a predictor elation, thus paying forlookahead with an increased local lexical am-biguity.5 Status and Conclus ionThe algorithm described has been imple-mented and tested as part of the WACSG sys-tem that is based on the Stuttgart LFG system(Eisele 1987).Chart parsing of robust cf gzammars is a pow-erful method to cope with the confignrationalaspects of defectiveness.
It is part of a ma-jor enterprise to re-analyze robustness not as oparsing problem but as a problem of weak lin-guistic description.
Therefore, any formal workon the linguistics of defectiveness can be ex-pected to improve our methods of robust pars-ing.6 Bibl iography\[1\] Carboncll, J. and Hayes, P.: RecoveryStrategies for Parsing Extragrammatica\]Language, in: AJCL 9, 3-4, 1983\[2\] D~,rre, J.: Wcitcrentwicklung des Earley-Algorithmus flit kontextfreie and ID/LP-Graanmatiken, LiLog-Report 28, IBMDeutschland 1987\[~\] Earley, J.: An Efficient Context-free Pars-ing Algorithm, in: CACM 13, 2, 1970\[4\] Goeser, S.: A linguistic Theory of Robust-hess, in: Proc.
