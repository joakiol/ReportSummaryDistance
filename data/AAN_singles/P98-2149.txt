Dealing with distinguishing descriptionsin a guided composition systemPascal Mouret Monique RolbertLaboratoire d'Informatique d MarseiUeUniversit6 de la Mediterran6eFaculte des Sciences de LuminyCase 901, 163 Avenue de Luminy13288 Marseille, France{Pascal.Mouret,Monique.Rolbert}@lim.univ-mrs.fr}Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide computable account for some definitedescriptions.
To this end, we define in terms of inclusion the notion of distinguishing descriptionand of distinguishable entities introduced by \[Dale 89\].
These def'mitions allow us to giveconditions of wellformedness for incomplete distinguishing descriptions.
We also extend thenotion of distinguishing description to take into account cases of synonymy and hyponymy.We describe areal application of a guided composition system where this sort of expressionsarise.1.IntroductionMany studies in natural languageprocessing are concerned with how togenerate or understand definite descriptionsthat evoke a discourse entity alreadyintroduced in the context.
An interestingsolution to this problem was proposed by\[Dale 89\] in terms of distinguishingdescriptions and distinguishable entities.Informally, a distinguishing descriptionis a def'mite description which designates oneand only one entity among others in a contextset.
Many natural language interfaces need todeal with this sort of NPs.
We develop anapplication where these NPs occur in aparticular way: the application works in aguided composition mode where correctsentences have to be produced word by wordby the system.
So, the problem of the(contextual) correctness of an incompletedistinguishing description arises.
Moreover,the system has to understand (complete orincomplete) distinguishing descriptions inwider cases of references than those intendedby \[Dale 89\], including cases of hyponymyand so on.
We are going to show that theway we refine the notions introduced by Daleallows us to l~eat hese two points in a rathersimple and efficient manner.In ?2, we present our definitions ofd i s t ingu ish ing  descr ip t ions  anddistinguishable entities and we use them todeal with incomplete distinguishingdescriptions and wider cases of reference.An algorithm for incomplete distinguishingdescription production is given.
?3 presentsthe application, ?4 related works and ?5concludes.2.Dealing with distinguishingdescriptionsFollowing \[Dale 96\], let us consider thatthe context contains aset of entities E = (ei,e2 ..... en} and that each entity e/is describedby the set of its properties Pei.\[Dale 89\] introduced the notion ofdistinguishing description ( dd) which is thelinguistic realisation of a set of propertieswhich are together t ue of an entity e~ but ofno other entity in ~ \[Dale 89\] also mentionsthe notion of distinguishable entity, which isintuitively an entity that can be distinguishedfrom the others by the use of a distinguishingdescription made from its set of properties.Using inclusion between sets ofproperties, we can say that:1. an entity ei in E is distinguishable ifthere is no entity ~ in E such that Pei ~ P~/.905Similarly to the process of generating a a~ffrom the set of properties of an entity todesignate it, we will consider that to everydefinite description corresponds the set ofproperties (noted Pdd) that it contains(informally the set of properties of which thedefinite description is the l inguisticrealisation).
We will say that a definitedescription designates every entity ei of Esuch that Pdd~ Pei (the entity agrees with thedescription).Then, according to the definition given in\[Dale 89\] and the uniqueness requirement,we can say that:2. a def in i te  descr ipt ion  is adistinguishing description if (el~ Pdd~ Pei}is a singleton.These two definitions will help us to dealwith incomplete descriptions and to extendthe notion of distinguishing description.2.1Treating distinguishing des-criptions in a guided com-position systemGuided composition is a paradigm forNLP which is an answer to variouslimitations to NLP interfaces, especiallylimitations due to coverage of lexicons andgrammars (\[Rincel & al 89\]).
The basic ideais to inform the user, at every step, about heabilities of the system: for example, such asystem can allow the user to ask whatword(s) can appear at a time in a sentence.Then, the user chooses among the wordsproposed and so on.
Therefore, the systemmust provide only expected words, i.e.words that can lead to a correct wholesentence.In particular, the system must generatepart ial ly (word by word) def initedescriptions which have to be correct from acontextual point of view when they formcomplete NPs.
In a guided composition pointof view, the problem is then to find how toknow as early as possible if a string ofwords (an incomplete distinguishingdescription or Ida) may or may not lead to acorrect distinguishing description.In order to treat Id~ we have to def'meconditions so as to decide when it will lead toa correct definite description.
For example,if there are two kings on a chessboard, oneblack and one white, the definite description'le roi' ('the king') is a correct definitedescription from a syntactical point of view,but not from a contextual point of viewbecause two entities of the context can bedesignated by it.
However,  it is acontextually correct incomplete definitedescription because it can lead to a correctdistinguishing description if completed by'noir' ( 'black') or 'blanc' ( 'white').Conversely, if there is no bishop on thechessboard, the definite description 'le fou'('the bishop') is neither a distinguishingdescription nor a (contextually) correctincomplete ddbeeause it doesn't designateany entity of the context and, moreover,can't be completed to designate one.So, an Idd is considered as correct if itcan lead to a definite description which is add.
As seen in this example, an Idd candesignate more than one entity (as for thewe note Pldd the set of properties fromwhich an Ia~lis made and the Idddesignatesevery entity ei such that Pldd~ Pe~; so it isclear that the uniqueness requirement is notadequate to caracterise correct IdaCLet DE be the set of distinguishableentities of E. In order to be sure that an Iddcan always be completed to be add ,  anecessary and sufficient property is thatsome of the entities designated by the Iddarein DE, i.e3.
an Idd is correct iff {ei/Pldd~ Pei}Actually, an Iddwhich designates entitiesin DE can be continued into add  by usingproperties which lead to designate one andonly one of these ntities.Finally,4.
an Idd can be add if there exists oneand only one entity e./in E that agrees with it.Notice that the uniqueness requirementmust be met on E and not DE, Actually, theremay be only one entity in DE that agrees withan Iddand several others in E that agree with906it (see example below).
In this case, the Ida"is correct but is not yet add .
It is alsointeresting to note that the only entity thatagrees with the ddis the referent of thedefinite description.
That is to say that theprocess of verifying if an Iddis correct leadsto solve the definite description i  the end.Let us have a look at an example:Suppose we have a set of entitiesE -  (el, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6}, the propertiesof which are :e1 is a dog,e2 is a dog that barks,e3 is a dog that barks,e4 is a red bird that sings,e5 is a red bird,e6is a bird that flies.In this example, e2 and e3 are notdistinguishable, because their sets ofproperties are identical (and so Pc3 ~ Pc2 and~'e2 ~ Pc3 ).
el is not distinguishable b causePc1 ~ Pc2.
Finally, e5 is not distinguishablebecause Pc5 ~ Pc4" Therefore, only e 4 and e6are distinguishable entities.
So, the set DE isnot empty and, in the guided compositionmode, the Idd 'le' ('the') can be proposed.What words can be proposed after?According to this context, 'le chien' ('thedog') is not a correct Iddbecause there is nodistinguishable entity agreeing with it.
On thecontrary, 'l'oiseau' ('the bird') is correct andcan lead to at least hree different a~ 'l'oiseauqui chante' (the bird that sings') whichdesignate 4 and is minimal, Toiseau rougequi chante' ('the red bird that sings') whichdesignates e4 but is not minimal and Toiseauqui vole' ('the bird that flies') whichdesignates e6.Notice that, for instance, Toiseau rouge'('the red bird') is not a dd~ although there isexactly one distinguishable entity (e4) thatagrees with it: this dddesignates also e3".
Theuniqueness requirement must be met on thewhole set of entities from the context, andnot only on the set of all distinguishableentities.2.2 Refining the notion of dis-tinguishing descriptionUsing the definition of distinguishingdescription based on inclusion given above,we are going to show that this notion can berefined to take into account more subtle casesof reference.
We define a more discerninginclusion between surface descriptions andsets of properties in order to treat cases ofsynonymy, nominalisation, hyponymy andso on: we want to generalize the notion ofagreement toevery case where a descriptionis able to "evoke" an entity.
Actually, it iswell known (see for example \[Corblin 95\])that an entity can be designated not only interms strictly equal to those which served tointroduce it.
For example, a dog can bedesignated by 'the animal' or a child whorobs something by 'the robber'.To take these cases into account, wedefine the -inclusion (noted ~ ) between setsof properties as follow:-some -inclusion are given (these arethe basic one) like for instance (animal}(dog} or (robber} ~ (child, rob} i.erepresentations of relations of hyponymy,synonymy, and so on.
These inclusions haveto be known by the system;-for all P, P', P" sets of properties, ifpT- p' ~ p" then PEP" ;-for all P, P' sets of properties, if PP', then P-P' can be partionned into sub-sets which are -included in P'.Basic -.inclusion representing relations ofhyponymy is not too hard to define, and isuseful for a lot of treatments in NLP(conceptual spects of NLP, for example).Other basic - inclusions need moreknowledge (about the world and thelanguage), not so easy to implement, but alsonecessary in other parts of the treatment ofnatural language.The -inclusion is transitive and works asexpected on unions of sets.
We use it(instead of simple inclusion) to compare a setof properties of an Idd(or add) and a set ofproperties of an entity and we say that the setof entities designated by a dd (or a Idd) isthen (e//Pdd 7- Pei}.907So, this inclusion allows to use thedistinguishing description 'the robber' todesignate an entity that is a child who robssomething.
So it's a nice extension of theinclusion, when used to define the sets ofentity an/&/'(or a da9 designates.It is also interesting to see if- inclusioncan be used between sets of entities'propert ies to def ine the notion ofdistinguishable entity.
Suppose we have twoentities in the context, one which is a robberand the other which is a child who hasrobbed something.
If we use ~inclusion tofind distinguishable entities, then the set ofproperties of the entity which is a robber is-.included in the set of properties of theother, and so the entity which is a robber isnot distinguishable.
But we know that in anexample like 'A robber meets a child whorobs something.
The robber ...', the definitedescription 'the robber' rather designates thefirst entity introduced as 'a roober' than thesecond one.
And this implies that the firstentity is distinguishable.
So, we must notuse the -inclusion to distinguish entities (butonly the simple inclusion).The remaining problem is then that, inthis case, the definite description 'the robber'is - included in two distinguishable entities('a robber' and 'a child who robssomething'), and then can't be a dd, in thesense introduced in ?
2.1.
To take intoaccount an example like the one above andthe effect of the ~inclusion, we must refinethe def'mition of what can be a dd~ a ddmustdesignate (in the sense of the -inclusion)only one entity of the context.
But if there ismore than one, but only one entity e such thatPdd~ Pe (with the simple inclusion), then thea~'is correct and the entity designated is e.As shown below, we have used thisinclusion while dealing with incompletedistinguishing description.2.3 Algorithm for Idd pro-duction using simple inclusionor -.inclusionIdd as defined in 2.1 do not depend onhow they are produced.
Here we give analgorithm which builds Idd from left to right,word by word, in order to be used in aguided composition system.First of all, it can be seen that if a givenIddis not correct, any Iddstarting with this/&/'cannot be correct.
Hence, we just need toexamine one word strings first, then twoword strings, and so on, which fits perfectlyto the guided composition mode that we usedin our applications ( ee ?3).So, the only words that the system mustpropose are those which continue a correctIddinto a correct IdaC At the beginning, theword 'le' ('the') can be proposed if and onlyif DE is not empty (~le' - 0).
Thus, wehave a set of distinguishable entities.
A wordw l can be proposed if and only if thereexists at least one entity in this set that agreeswith 'le Wl'.
And so on.The implemented algorithm works asfollow:Let us consider Wl..Wn an ldd.
At eachstep, two sets are built: one corresponding toall the entities that agree with Wl..Wn (wecall it PRwl..Wn, the set of the possiblereferents of the ldd), one corresponding tothe distinguishable entities that agree with it(DP~l..Wn, the distinguishable possiblereferents of Wl..Wn).
If DPRwl..Wn is notempty, the Idd is correct and can becontinued.
If ~Wl..Wn is a singleton (and ifthe Idd is an NP syntactically correct) thenthe ldd can be considered as a dd, and itsreferent is the element of the set.
If ff~l..Wnis not a singleton, the system must proposewords to continue the NP (which is alwayspossible).
The words w which arecontextually correct are those for which theset ~l .
.WnW remains not empty.As seen above, the set aYt"AWl..Wn is builtusing simple inclusion.The set PRu,1..w n can be constructedaccording to simple inclusion or -inclusion.In the second case, to test if an Iddwl..Wn isa da~ the algorithm has to test if P'gc.Vl..Wn isa singleton or if a subset of it according tosimple inclusion is a singleton.We have the following properties:908~. '
the ' -  E ~e' -  DEFor each correct Iafd'Wl..Wn:D'I~I..w n~ PRwl..w nand for each word w:PRwl..wnw ~ ~ol..wnDPRwl..wnw" PRwl..wnw n DPRwl..wnand so,~a,1.

Computing~i .
.wn and E~wI..wn is achieved easilyfor n>l: ~Vl..W nis composed of all thoseelements of ~i.
.Wn.1 that also agree withW l..Wn.
The same applies to DPRwl..Wn"The only somewhat time-consuming taskrelies in computing aT/~e,.3.An applicationThe questions tackled in this paper haveappeared while developping the systemEREL 1 (\[Godbert 98\]) built on ILLICO.
Thegeneric ILLICO software (\[Milhaud 92\])belongs to the category of guidedcomposition systems we have presentedabove.
It has been used to develop severalnatural language interfaces (see for example\[Guenthner & al.
92\], \[Pasero & al.
94\]).
Inthis system, if a string proposed by the useris incorrect, hen the system keeps the largestcorrect sub-string (from the beginning of thestring) and proposes all the possible wordsthat can continue this sub-string.
If thesentence is empty, then the system canpropose all the possible first words, and soon.
It is important to notice that thegenerative process is driven by the syntacticparser.EREL is a software for languagerehabilitation that we have designed in acollaboration with medical staffs specialisedin the treatment of autistic-like children.
Thesystem provides a set of user-friendly1 The project EREL is partially funded by theConseil Gtntral des Bouches-du-RhSne.educational play activities designed to helpusers to employ common language.So, it is very important in this kind ofapplications to offer a sophisticated guidedcomposition mode, and in particular toproduce only correct sentences atevery level(syntactical, conceptual but also contextual).At the moment, there are two main types ofgames in EREL: in the first one, chidrenspeak about or ask questions about a picturethey see on the screen.
The context whichcontains objects about which the chidren cantall about is preliminary computed and itdoes not change along with the discourse.So, the set of distinguishable entities DE isbuilt at one time.The second activity concerns a dialog on alogic game in which users compose orders innatural language to achieve agoal.
One of theexercises consists in putting and movingobjects on a board.
A child has an initialstock of objects that he can put on a checkerboard, permute, move, or stow away.
Hegives orders to the system using naturallanguages sentences and he can seeimmediately on the board the effects thesentences have.
The interface looks likethis:Son I I : | Iu I | I  N luUIU COi l l f l l l l l t l lI .
PllEM I Eli DFIk41ERS I I I t l l  I lU l l l i l l l  :| ii )4 II )rr~\[ Continued\ [ chOn~l  I I  ?er r l  nu l l  e r i c  I i  fo~d .,.Here, in the French version, the user hasbegun a sentence ~,Echange le carr~ noir avecle rond...~ (Permute the black square withthe circle...) and the system, according to thecontextual situation, proposes the possiblewords to be selected: blanc, gris, noir(white, grey, black).
If there had been nowhite circle on the board, the word whitewould not have been proposed.We have also implemented part of the-inclusion presented above so the child canuse the hyponym pawn to designate atriangle or a square or a circle.
The hyponymrelations are already represented in the909system by a conceptual graph which is usedin other parts of the system.In this game, it is clear that contextuallycorrect definite descriptions must designateobjects in the context (the system has to acton them, so it has to find them).
So, in theguided composition mode, the system has tocompute/&/'as they have been defined in ?2.The objects are moving during the game so,as opposed to the ira'st ype of activity, thecontext changes and the set ofdistinguishable entities has to be computed atevery step.
Moreover, the children can createnew pawns (made from a predefined set ofshapes and colors).
These objects are addedin the context and must be taken into accountfor later mentions.The set of distinguishable entities is notthe set of all the objects because some objectsmay not be distinguishable.
For example, iftwo objects have the same shape and colorand are in the stock ('Rtserve' on the figureabove), then they can not be distinguished(we assume there is no relative position inthe reserve).
The user can act on them byusing sentences like 'put one of the redtriangles which are in the reserve in the caseA4' but not like 'put the red triangle which isin the reserve...'.
If there is no other triangleon the chessboard, then the system must notpropose beginnings of definite NP like 'thetriangle...'EREL is under development and amedical team who works with autisticchildren is testing apreliminary version.4.Related worksThe work presented here uses notionsfirstly introduced by \[Dale 89\] andmentioned in many works in the field.
Wehave presented here new applications andextensions.
Actually, the problem treatedhere raises the general question of generatingdefinite descriptions.
Generally, these worksdeal rather with the problem of what to sayand how to say it.
\[Novak 88\] deals with theproblem (among others) of when and howrestrictives relative clause have to be used indefinite NP.
The system that he describes iable to produced efinite NP like the firstyellow BMW, the second yellow BMW ifnecessary.
\[Kronfeld 89\] talks about'conversionally relevant descriptions' whichis typically the problem of how to saysomething according to the context ofdiscourse or the user's goal like in \[Appelt85\].
The relations between Gricean maximsand the generation fdefinite NP are studiedin \[Passonneau 95\] and \[Dale & al.
96\] forexample.\[Horacek 97\] gives a good comparison ofthe previous works; his analyses makeappear the problem of the linguisticrealisation of a set of properties of an entityto generate a description that designates itand he proposes an algorithm which takesinto account this problem during the choiceof the property which will be used to build aConcerning the production of Idd; we arenot really confronted with the problemsmentioned in \[Horacek 97\] because theguided composition system doesn't generateNPs from entity representation; its parsergenerates partial syntactically correctsentences which are filtered by contextualcriteria (the processes are driven in parallelthanks to coroutined methods).
Moreover,concerning what to say and how to say it, itis the user who chooses what word (amongthe possibilities offered by the system) willbe kept o build the sentence, at every step.Concerning the extension ofthe notion ofagreement that we make (and so of the notionof distinguishing description), manylinguists mention the phenomenon we wantto take into account.
A more computationalpoint of view is discussed in \[Groenendijk &al 96, pp 25-27\] (the example of 'the doctor'and 'the man').
The authors do not givereally computable solutions to this problem.It seems that he use of simple inclusion and~inclusion to f'md distinguishable entity andto identify a referent for a (complete orincomplete) distinguishing description (asdescribed in ?2.2) deals rather efficientlywith the problem5.ConclusionWe showed here how the uniquenessrequirement, when dealing with incompletedefinite descriptions, turns into a requirementof that particular sort of entities from the910context, he distinguishable entities.
Then weshowed how the notion of distinguishingdescription can be extended using inclusionand what we called ~inclusion.
An algorithmthat uses these ideas and allows to know asearly as possible incomplete definitedescription that earl lead to correct definitedescription from those that cannot is given.The algorithm is incremental, which ispartieulary useful in a guided compositionsystem and allows also to solve completedefinite description (finding the referent).
