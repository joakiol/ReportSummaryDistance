As isusual for a logical approach to language,all types of reference, with the except ionof concrete reference, are reduced to quan-t i f icat ion of di f ferent kinds, and quanti f i -cat ion can  be defined~ with a suff ic ient de-g:L.ee o f  p rec : i s ion ,  by s ta t ing  truth cond i t i -ons fox' sentences w i th  the cor respond ingquant i f ie r?

Thus, anattempt to reduce referent ia l  meaning ofthe g(me:cic indef in i te art ic le in Engl ishto 'th~vl~ o f  the  quanti f ier  adject ive(m~de in Jespersen 1927)  can be demonstra-ted to be futile; in fact, statement (la),for exaunple, is usual ly considered to betrue, while (lb) is def in i te ly false (thougjland a l l  are synonyms):(1) a. N o r v e ~ c y vysokogo rostaw e g i a n s are tall'n o r v e ~ c y vysokogo'E o rb.
V s erosta'A 1 1tall'n o r w e ~ i a n s areAn attempt to capture referent ial  as-pects of the meaning of a generic term withthe help of a "quanti f ier  of major ity" (Par-sons 1970) or a quant i f ier  'usually' raay be,perhaps, successful  for sentence (la), whichis approximately synonymous to sentence (2):(2) N o r v e ~ c y oby~no ~ysokogo rosta'N o r w e g i a n s are usual ly tall~but the idea of major i ty  has nothing to dowith the meaning of such sentences as(3) Kit - m lekop i ta ju~ee'The whale is a m~al '(indeed, (3) ~ (3')*A whale is.usual ly amammal);  or with the meaning of sentence(4) A t o m sostoit iz jadra i e lektronov'A t o m consists of the nucleus andelectrons'.A suggest ion was made to the effect thatgeneric terms do not refer to entit ies ofthe real world at all.
Thus, according toWierzb icka 1980, in such sentences as (1)tal lness is attr ibuted not to a norwegian(i.e.
not to a real person), but to ouri m a g e of a norwegian.
However, thisclaim, even if it is true, cannot be truefor all species of generic expressions.
Porone thing, generic terms can occur in thecontext of identity sentences, cf.
(5) Deti - ~to budu~ie  l judl'Chi ldren are men to be'.And what is ident i ty ' i f  not identity of re-ference?
501From a formal point of view, what cha-racter izes generic noun phrases~ at least inlanguages without articles, such as Russian,is the fact that they do not comprise anydeterminers or quant i f ier  adjectives, notonly in the expl ic ite but in the impliciteform as well.
In other words, generic ~Psevade referent ia l  character izat ion:  no wordsexpl ic i tel~ express ing the m o d e o fr e f e r e n c e of a noun phrase (cf.
Pa~du~eva \ ] .985) can occur  w i th in  a ge~leric NP;moreover, no words can be added to a genericNP to ~ake clear its referent ia l  meaning ormeanings, as is obvious from examples (1) -(5).
The analysis which fol lows aims at pro-v iding generic l~Ps with such an interpreta-t ion of their referent ia l  import that wouldmatch this formal character izat ion.
Our di-rect aim is to provide an analysis for gene-ric NPs of hussian, but many of the problemsdiscussed are semantic in nature and thuslanguage independent.2.
Generic phrases denot ing s i tuat ionsGeneric use  is co~m~zon not only for nounphrases denot ing objects, like those in  (J)-~(5), but also for noun phrases with proposi -t ional meaning, cfo(6) C v e t e n i j e r~i vsegda napomi-naet ~mue na~alo vojny'F \] o w e r i n g o f r y e alwaysreminds me of the begin ing of the war'.

What weclaim is that at least in this case broaden~ing the object of invest igat ion wil l  notcompl icate the whole picture; just the oppo -~site, it may contr ibute to its clar i f icat ion?3.
Gener:\[cs as a grs~nmatical problemGeneric use is a problem not only fo:creferent ia l  semantics but also for a de~,scr ipt ive gra~rm~ar of a language?
To ment ionjust two points?a) In the context of a generic NP grar~,.-matical  Number (i.e.
the opposit ion of Sin.,,gular vs. Plural) cannot retain its usualmeaning.
Ilowever, on the one hand, thechoice of ~umber in generic NPs is not ri-gidly regulated~ i.e.
synonymous var iat ionof Number is possible, cfo(14) a, L o 5 a d' - umnoje ~yvotnoje'A h o r s e is a clever animal'?b.
L o ~ a d i ~-, m~uyje ~yvo~nyje'11 o r s e s are clever animals'?On the other hand, S ingular  and Plural  ingeneric, N~s -a~ce not-  Tz~el~ "i:n-be-rcl~angeablethus, it is impossible to say(15) U has v dome zavels 'a t a r a k a n(Sg)in the meaning 'There are cockroaches inour house', if only in the context of a"lan&axage game", and it is absolutely impos-.sible to use sentence(16) ~Glaz u ~toj ryby imeet formug r u ~ (Pl)in order to convey the meaning 'The eye ofthis f ish has the shape of a p~ a r'o Thereis a strong feel ing that the choice of grsm~-mat ica l  Number  in generic NPs is dependentupon their  referent ia l  propert ies;  in otherwords, it seems that di f ferent classes ofgeneric NPs can be del imitated with di f fer~ent requirements as for the choice of Nma~bet.b) Another  grammatical  problem connectedwith generic expressions, concerns the choirsce of Tense and Aspect of the verb in a ge~neric proposit ion.
In Lyons 1978 it is sug-gested that generic proposi t ions lie out  ofthe scope of the Tense opposit ion (ice, thatthey are omnitemporal) .
Lyons claims thatthis thesis is not d isproved by such examp~les as(17) D i n o s a u r s were peacefulanimals ,because Past Tense in such sentences corres-ponds only-to the fact that dinosaurs areextinct and not to the fact that they havestopped being peaceful,  as would be the caseif Past Tense had been used here in its usu-al meaningo Sti l l  for such sentence as(18) D i n o s a u r s died out (becameext  i nc  t )i t  wou ld  be absurd  to  ma inta in  that  i t  i somaitemporal :  in ( \ ] .8)  Past  Tense has itsmost com~,~on meaning?4.. Generic term and generic proposi t ionThe main conclusion that can be drawnfrom the exist ing l i terature on generics(cfo a substant ial  rev iew in Car lson 1978)isthat generic expessions are heterogeneous(W~ that in Russ ian even less informationcan be got from the gra~mgatical form of ageneric term than in English, because of thelack of ~rt.lcles)o Thus the line of analysisWhich we fo l low in this study consists inmaking a series of del imitat ions that woulddivlde generic expressions i n to  sew.~ral dif~ferent groups so that each statement wouldapply only to that group of generic expres-sions : for  wh ich  i t  :Ls t rne .~'irs\[ o?'
all, it J.s necessary to sepaz,a-te generic NPs when used in 'the context of ag e n e r i c  p r o p o s i t i o n  (orgeneric statement) from their  occurrences inal l  otheL" contexts.
We propose the fo l lowingdefinit ion: A propos i t ion is cal led genericif a generic noun phrase G const i tutes itsn o t \[ o n a 1 t h e m e (topic), i.e.if this propos i t ion is a b o u t Go Thus,in (19)propos i t ion  is generic:(19) P r o f e s s i o n a 1 m a t h e -m a t i c i a n wil l  read the bookby M.At ja with pleasure.o\[ndeed, (19) is a statement a b o u t pro-fessional  mathematic ians?
Neanwhile,  (20) isnot a generic statement- ~(20) The book by NoAt ja  wil l  be of inte~res-\[t for p r o f e s s i o n a 1m a t h e m a t i c i a n s  .In fact, (20) is not about mathematic ians#its them8 is a concrete indiv idual ized ob~ject ~ a book by ~oAtjaoGeneric NPs const i tut ing the subject ofa generic propos i t ion are more readi\].y sub-~itted to semantic analysis, for in this con~-text referent ia l  import of gener ic i ty can berepresented, at least in some oontexts~ a~ akind.
of quanti f icat ion.
Indeed, if a genericNP is a subject of a proposit ion, then thequant i f ier  which bounds this NP has maximumscope~ its scope is the whole sentence.
Andif so then the referencial  import of thisquantif ier, and hence of the generic NP, canbe revealed by means of truth condit ions ofthe sentence a s a w h o i e o Other-wise, ice.
in cases where the generic ~iPdoes not constitute ~he subject of the pro~posit ion, it is a l together unclear, whatproposi t ion const i tutes the scope of ~hesupposed "generic quantif ier"~ Thus, forsentences in (21) logical representat ion isa puzzle(21) a. Ivan can kill a b e a r ob.

Generic NPs as names of classesIn some contexts generic terms can besuccessful ly  treated as names (or descrip~tions) of the corresponding clans.
~k~r exam-ple, generic terms used as subjects of pre-~dicates which are meaningless unless whenpredicated to classes (.as to be a ir~mr!jal;to become extinct in examples (3) and (18)),are best represented as names of classes (inEngl ish such' generic terms can only be mark~-ed by a def inite article~ in Russian theyhave no special d ist inct ive features), Cfo(22)  Nekogda j a g u a r byl z'aspros~ra~hen pc vsemu zerauomu ~aru'Soi~e time ago t h e j a g u a rwas spread all over the world'?In Burton-Roberts  1976 it is c\].aimed that5O3gener ic  te rms  wh ich  are  ac tua l ly  names  o:fc lasses ,  even when \ [ ;hey occupy  the  themat icpos i t ion  in the ut;terance, do not  fo rm anygener ic  p ropos i t ion~ ~P denot ing  a c lass  andre fer r ing  to a c lass,  can be t reated  as aterm wi th  concrete  re\].

This def in i t iongives an explanat ion to the fo l lowing examp-le f~'om Carlson 1978: sentence Books areusua l l~)a j !erbacks  sounds odd, though it is,perhaps, true that most books are now paper-basks?
The fact is, that this s i tuat ion isnot as yet considered to be natural.7o Adverbia l  quant i f ica l ionIn a similar way truth condit ions forother types of adverbial  quant i f icat ion ingeneric p~oposi t ions can be stated.
What isimportant is the fact that there are con-texts in ~hich adverbial  quant i f icat ion can-not be reduced to quant i f icat ion over theextension of the subject term.Take ex~np\]e(27) Young people usual ly  overest imatetheir resourseso~\[ts meaning cannot be adequately repre-sented by means of quant i f icat ion over theset of all young people: (27) ~ 'Most youngpeople overest imale their  resourses'.
Whatis ment in (27) is that f o r m o s tc a s e s when a young man est imates his(or her) resourses he overest imates them .So it is c lear that quant i f icat ion over si-tuat ions and not over objects is involvedhere.
In the same way we can represent  themeaning of sentences (8) - (13) with genericnames of s i tuat ions from section 2.8.

Genuine generic proposit ions are, infact, o~mitemporal .9.
Conclus ionOur invest igat ion can be looked upon asa proof of the thesis that for typical gene-ric noun phrases a logico-semant ic  interpre-tat ion can be given which str ict ly corres-ponds to their surface structure (in art ic-le- lack ing languages): generic terms can betreated as referent ia l ly  incomplete phrases,with qu~nti f icat ion expressed outside thephrase itself or not expressed at all.ReferencesBully, Ch.
