Empirical lower bounds on twomeasures of alignment error rate, i.e.
the oneintroduced in Och and Ney (2000) and onewhere only complete translation units are con-sidered, are derived for 2-SCFGs and relatedformalisms.1 IntroductionSyntax-based approaches to machine translationtypically use synchronous grammars to recognize orproduce translation equivalents.
The synchronous?This work was done while the first author was a SeniorResearcher at the Dpt.

?The second author is supported by the German ResearchFoundation in the Emmy Noether project Ptolemaios on gram-mar learning from parallel corpora.production rules are typically learned from align-ment structures (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2004;Chiang, 2007) or from alignment structures andderivation trees for the source string (Yamada andKnight, 2001; Zhang and Gildea, 2004).
They arealso used for inducing alignments (Wu, 1997; Zhangand Gildea, 2004).It is for all three reasons, i.e.
translation, in-duction from alignment structures and induction ofalignment structures, important that the synchronousgrammars are expressive enough to induce all thealignment structures found in hand-aligned goldstandard parallel corpora (Wellington et al, 2006).Such alignments are supposed to reflect the structureof translations, typically contain fewer errors and areused to evaluate automatically induced alignments.In this paper it is shown that the synchronousgrammars used in Wu (1997), Zhang et al (2006)and Chiang (2007) are not expressive enough to dothat.
The synchronous grammars used in these sys-tems are, formally, synchronous context-free gram-mars of rank two (2-SCFGs), or equivalently (nor-mal form) inversion transduction grammars (ITGs).1The notion of rank is defined as the maximum num-ber of constituents aligned by a production rule,i.e.
the maximum number of distinct indeces.
Ourresults will be extended to slight extensions of 2-SCFGs, incl.
the extension of ITGs proposed byZens and Ney (2003) (xITGs), synchronous treesubstitution grammars of rank two (2-STSGs) (Eis-ner, 2003; Shieber, 2007), i.e.
where tree pairs in-clude at most two linked pairs of nonterminals, andsynchronous tree-adjoining grammars of rank two12-SCFGs allow distinct LHS nonterminals, while ITGs donot; but for any 2-SCFG an equivalent ITG can be constructedby creating a cross-product of nonterminals from two sides.19(2-STAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Harbuschand Poller, 1996; Nesson et al, 2008).
The over-all frequency of alignment structures that cannotbe induced by these approaches is examined acrossa wide collection of hand-aligned parallel corpora.Empirical lower bounds on the coverage of the sys-tems are derived from our results.Our notion of an alignment structure is standard.Words can be aligned to multiple words.
Unalignednodes are permitted.
Maximally connected sub-graphs are called translation units.
There is onemore choice to make in the context of many-to-manyalignments, namely whether the alignment relationis such that if wi|w?k and wi|w?l, resp., are aligned,and wj |w?k are aligned too, then wj |w?l are alsoaligned.
If so, the alignment structure is divided intocomplete translation units.
Such alignment struc-tures are therefore called complete; in Goutte etal.
(2004), alignment structures with this propertyare said to be closed under transitivity.
An align-ment structure is simply written as a sequence ofalignments, e.g.
?wi|w?k, wi|w?l, wj |w?k, wj |w?k?, or,alternatively, as sequences of (possibly discontinu-ous) translation units, e.g.
?wiwj|w?kw?l?.A translation unit induced by a synchronousgrammar is a set of terminals that are recognizedor generated simultaneously.
Consequently, syn-chronous grammars can only induce complete align-ment structures (by transitivity of simultaneity).2Syntax-based approaches to machine translationsare commonly evaluated in terms of their alignmenterror rate (AER) on one or more parallel corpora(Och and Ney, 2000; Zhang and Gildea, 2004).
TheAER, in the case where all alignments are sure align-ments, isAER = 1?
2|SA ?GA||SA| + |GA|where GA are the gold standard alignments, and SAthe alignments produced by the system.AER has been criticized by Fraser andMarcu (2007).
They show that AER does notpenalize unequal precision and recall when adistinction between sure and possible alignments is2One of the hand-aligned parallel corpora used in our exper-iments, the one also used in Pado?
and Lapata (2006), includesincomplete alignment structures.made.
Since no such distinction is assumed below,the classical definition is used.We introduce also the notion of translation uniterror rate (TUER), which is defined asTUER = 1 ?
2|SU ?GU ||SU |+ |GU |where GU are the translation units in the gold stan-dard, and SU the translation units produced by thesystem.
In other words, what is measured is a sys-tem?s ability to predict translation units relative tothe Gold standard, not just its ability to predict align-ments.
If the system only gets part of a translationunit right, it is not rewarded.In the context of many-to-many alignments, thismeasure may tell us more about translation qualitythan AER.
Consider, for instance, the small chil-dren?s book discourse in Danish:(1) MadsMadsogCONJMetteMettel?ggerput.FIN.PREStalnumber.PLsammen.together?Mads and Mette add numbers.?
(2) MadsMadsogCONJMetteMettel?ggerput.FIN.PREStalnumber.PLsammentogetherhvereverydag.day?Mads and Mette add numbers every day.?
(3) MadsMadsogCONJMetteMettekancan.FIN.PRESgodtgoodlidelike.INFattoaddere.add.INF?Mads and Mette like to add.?
(4) MetteMettesp?rgerask.FIN.PRESofte:often:SkalShall.FIN.FUT/PRESviPRON.PL.1addereadd.INFsammen?together?Mette often asks: Do you want to add together?
?Say (1-4) and the English translations are a par-allel corpus on which we would like to evaluate analigner or a statistical machine translation system.Say also that the test corpus has been aligned.
Letthe first three sentences be our training data and (4)our test data.20Note that the words l?gger .
.
.
sammen form a dis-continuous translation unit (?add?).
Say our aligneraligned only sammen and add, but not l?gger andadd.
This would mean that the alignments or trans-lations of add would most likely be associated withthe following probabilities:.66 (add, sammen).33 (add, addere)which again means that our system is likely toarrive at the wrong alignment or translation in (4).Nevertheless these alignments are rewarded in AER.TUER, on the other hand, reflects the intuition thatunless you get the entire translation unit it?s better toget nothing at all.The hand-aligned parallel corpora in our exper-iments come from the Copenhagen DependencyTreebank (Buch-Kromann, 2007), for five differentlanguage pairs, the German-English parallel corpusused in Pado?
and Lapata (2006), and the six par-allel corpora of the first 100 sentences of Europarl(Koehn, 2005) for different language pairs docu-mented in Graca et al (2008).
Consequently, ourexperiments include a total of 12 parallel corpora.The biggest parallel corpus consists of 4,729 sen-tence pairs; the smallest of 61 sentence pairs.
Theaverage size is 541 sentence pairs.
The six paral-lel corpora documented in Graca et al (2008) usesure and possible alignments; in our experiments, asalready mentioned, the two types of alignments aretreated alike.33The annotations of the parallel corpora differ in format andconsistency.
In fact the empirical lower bounds obtained be-low are lower bounds in two senses: (i) they are lower boundson TUERs because TUERs may be significantly higher thanthe empirical lower bounds found here, and (ii) they are lowerbounds in the sense that there may be hidden instances of theconfigurations in question in the parallel corpora.
Most seri-ously, our search algorithms only sort alignments, but not theirelements; instead they assume that their elements are listed inchronological order.
Sometimes, but rarely, this is not the case.Consider, for instance, file 1497, line 12 in the Danish?Spanishparallel corpus in the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank:<align out=?a56?
type=??
in=?b30+b32+b8?
outsign=?af?insign=?del de de?/>This is a translation unit.
The word in position 56 in the sourcestring is aligned to the words in positions 8, 30 and 32 in thetarget string, but note that the target string words do not appearin chronological order.
In some cases our algorithms take careof this; they do not, however, in general search all possible com-binations of words and alignments, but rely on the linear orderSect.

6 comparesour results to related work, in particular Zens andNey (2003).2 Inside-out alignmentsWu (1997) identified so-called inside-out align-ments, two alignment configurations that cannot beinduced by binary synchronous context-free gram-mars; these alignment configurations, while infre-quent in language pairs such as English?French(Cherry and Lin, 2006; Wellington et al, 2006),have been argued to be frequent in other lan-guage pairs, incl.
English?Chinese (Wellington etal., 2006) and English?Spanish (Lepage and De-noual, 2005).
While our main focus is on config-urations that involve discontinuous translation units,the frequencies of inside-out alignments in our par-allel corpora are also reported.
Recall that inside-outalignments are of the form (or upside-down):a b c de f g hora b c de f g hOur findings are summarized in Figure 1.
Notethat there is some variation across the corpora.
Thefact that there are no inside-out alignments in cor-pora 2?4 may be because annotators of these corporahave been very conservative, i.e.
there are many un-aligned nodes; the first corpus, which is also part ofthe Danish Dependency Treebank, also has very fewinside-out alignments.
It is not entirely clear to us ifthis has to do with the languages in question or theannotation guide lines (cf.
Danish?Spanish).In the Danish?Spanish corpus and in the English?German corpus the number of inside-out alignmentsis very high.
This, to some extent, has to do with thenumber of words that are aligned to multiple words.of the annotation.
This was necessary to do relatively efficientqueries.
The effect, however, is that our results are lower thanthe actual frequencies in the parallel corpora.
They are in thissense also lower bounds.21Snt.

Theactual number (191, 491) is smaller, but comparable.The first example in the English?German corpus,from sentence 2, illustrates this point.

}The following sets of alignments in addition makeup distinct inside-out alignments, but the new align-ments 6|3 and 7|3 are from the same translation unitas 5|3:{?1|7, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?2|8, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?,?3|9, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?1|7, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?,?2|8, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?3|9, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?
}Consequently, the alignment of sentences (5) and(6) in the English?German parallel corpus contains12 inside-out alignments, but only six inside-outalignments modulo translation units.3 Cross-serial discontinuous translationunitsA discontinuous translation unit (DTU) is a transla-tion unit where either the substring of source stringwords or the substring of target string words that oc-cur in it, is discontinuous, i.e.
there is a gap in it.Since translation units are induced by simulta-neous recognition, it is necessary for synchronous22grammars to have rules that introduce multiplesource side terminals and/or multiple target side ter-minals with at least one intervening nonterminal toinduce DTUs.
A DTU with multiple gaps in thesame side is called a multigap DTU; it is easy to seethat binary grammars cannot induce multigap DTUswith more than two gaps.A sequence of DTUs is said to be cross-serial if itis of the following form (or upside-down):ai ajbk bl bm bnCall any sequence of cross-serial DTUs a cross-serial DTU (CDTU).
So a CDTU is an alignmentconfiguration such that the source-side, resp.
target-side, contains four tokens bk, bl, bm, bn such that (i)bk ?
bl ?
bm ?
bn, (ii) bk and bm belong to thesame translation unit T , and bl and bn belong to thesame translation unit T ?, and (iii) T and T ?
are dis-tinct translation units.
The inability of ITGs, xITGsand 2-STSGs to induce CDTUs follows from the ob-servation that if bk and bm in the above are gener-ated or recognized simultatenously in any of theseformalisms, bl and bn cannot be generated or recog-nized simulaneously.
This is a straight-forward con-sequence of the context-freeness of the componentgrammars.The distinction between CDTUs and CDTUsmodulo translation units (CDTU-ms) is again im-portant.
The number of CDTU-ms is the number ofCDTUs such that all CDTUs differ by at most onetranslation unit.
The English?German parallel cor-pus, for example, contains 15,717 CDTUs, but only2,079 CDTU-ms.
Since our evaluation measure isTUER, we only systematically counted the occur-rences of CDTU-ms.
In a few cases, the number ofCDTUs was extracted too.
In general, it was abouteight times higher than the number of CDTU-ms.Our findings are summarized in Figure 2.
There isagain variation, but the average ratio of CDTU-ms is0.514, i.e.
there is a CDTU-m in about every secondaligned sentence pair.4 Syntax-based machine translationSyntax-directed translation schemas (SDTSs) wereoriginally introduced by Culik (1966) and studiedformally by Aho and Ullman (1972), who stressedthe importance of using only binary SDTSs for effi-ciency reasons,5 and later led to the development ofa number of near-equivalent theories, incl.
2-SCFGsand (normal form) ITGs.
Henceforth, we will referto this class of near-equivalent theories as ITGs (seefootnote 1).
This also means that production ruleshave at most one source-side and one target-side ter-minal on the RHS (see below).It is the ability of ITGs to induce alignments thatis our main focus.
Related work includes Wu (1997),Zens and Ney (2003) and Wellington et al (2006).Our results will also be extended to xITGs, 2-STSGsand 2-STAGs.
O(|G|n6) time recognition algo-rithms are known for ITGs, xITGs and 2-STSGs.
2-STAGs (O(|G|n12)) are more complex.The production rules in ITGs are of the follow-ing form (Wu, 1997), with a notation similar to whatis typically used for SDTSs and SCFGs in the rightcolumn:A ?
[BC] A ?
?B1C2, B1C2?A ?

A ?
?e, ?
?A ?
?
| f A ?
?
?, f?It is important to note that RHSs of productionrules have at most one source-side and one target-side terminal symbol.
This prevents induction ofmultiword translation units in any straight-forwardway.
xITGs (Zens and Ney, 2003) in part solves thisproblem.
All production rules in ITGs can be pro-duction rules in xITGs, but xITG production rulescan also be of the following form:A ?
[e/f1A?/f2] | ?e/f1A?/f2?Note, however, that these production rules still donot enable double-sided DTUs, i.e.
DTUs that trans-late into DTUs.
Such, however, occur relatively fre-quently in hand-aligned parallel corpora, e.g.
148times in the Danish?Spanish corpus.There is no room for detailed introductions of themore complex formalisms, but briefly their differ-ences can be summarized as follows:The move from ITGs to 2-STSGs is relativelysimple.
All production rules in ITGs characterize5The hierarchy of SDTSs of rank k is non-collapsing, andthe recognition problem without a fixed rank is NP-hard (Ahoand Ullman, 1972; Rambow and Satta, 1994).

It is said that this is the do-main of locality in ITGs.
2-STSGs extend the do-main of locality to arbitrarily big trees.
2-STSGsare collections of ordered pairs of aligned trees withat most two pairs of linked nonterminals.
The leafnodes in the trees may be decorated by terminals orinsertion slots where subtrees can be ?plugged in?.This is exactly what is meant by tree substitution.It is assumed that all terminals in a tree pair con-stitute a translation unit.
There exists a O(|G|n6)time parsing algorithm for 2-STSGs.
2-STSGs in-duce DTUs, double-sided DTUs and DTUs with atmost two gaps, but not inside-out alignments, CD-TUs and multigap DTUs with more than two gaps.The substitution operation on elementary trees issupplied with an adjunction operation in 2-STAGs(Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Harbusch and Poller,1996; Nesson et al, 2008).
In adjunction, auxil-iary trees, i.e.
elementary trees with a designated leafnode labeled by a nonterminal identical to the non-terminal that labels the root node, extend the derivedtree by expanding one of its nodes.
If an auxiliarytree t, with a root node and a leaf node both labeledA, is adjoined at some node n also labeled A in aderived tree t?, the subtree s?
(of t?)
rooted at n is re-placed by t, and s?
is then inserted at the leaf node oft.
In 2-STAGs, paired nodes across the source-sideand target-side trees are simultaneously expanded byeither substitution or adjunction.
A O(|G|n12) pars-ing algorithm can be deviced for 2-STAGs using thetechniques in Seki et al (1991).
The following 2-STAG translates Swiss-style cross-serial dependen-cies {wambnxcmdny} into {w(ac)mx(bd)ny} andthus induces cross-serial DTUs whenever m,n ?

2.5 Lower bounds on translation unit errorratesThe ratio of inside-out alignments over TUs is alower bound on the TUER for the binary versionsof all the formalisms listed above, except 2-STAGs.IOs/TUsDanish?English 0Danish?German 0Danish?Italian 0Danish?Russian 0Danish?Spanish 0.026English?German 0.017English?French 0.085English?Portuguese 0.070English?Spanish 0.070Portuguese?French 0.092Portuguese?Spanish 0.059Spanish?French 0.063For ITGs the ratio of DTUs over TUs is a lowerbound on the TUER.DTUs/TUsDanish?English 0.016Danish?German 0.042Danish?Italian 0.029Danish?Russian 0.044Danish?Spanish 0.121English?German 0.074English?French 0.101English?Portuguese 0.106English?Spanish 0.095Portuguese?French 0.084Portuguese?Spanish 0.081Spanish?French 0.076This is a considerable lower bound in itself,even for closely related languages such as Danish?German (4.2%) or Portuguese?Spanish (8.1%),which seems to have motivated research on exten-sions of ITGs (Zens and Ney, 2003).
The ratio ofCDTU-ms over TUs is a lower bound on the TUERfor all the formalisms listed, except 2-STAGs:CDTU-ms/TUsDanish?English 0Danish?German 0Danish?Italian 0.001Danish?Russian 0Danish?Spanish 0.018English?German 0.030English?French 0.041English?Portuguese 0.090English?Spanish 0.053Portuguese?French 0.030Portuguese?Spanish 0.056Spanish?French 0.025From these tables, empirical lower bounds onTUERs can be derived.
ITGs, for instance, will havea TUER of at least 2.6% + 12.1% = 14.7% forDanish?Spanish,6 while 2-STSGs, ignoring prob-lems caused by multigap DTUs with more than twogaps, will have a TUER of at least 7.0% + 9.0% =16.0% for English?Portuguese.
Similarly lowerbounds on AER for ITGs can be obtained by sum-ming IOs/As, i.e.
the number of inside-out align-ments over the number of alignments, DTUs/Asand CDTUs/As; for 2-STSGs, the lower bounds aregiven by IOs/As + CDTUs/As; and so on.
Even2-STAGs exclude alignments found in the data,namely multigap DTUs.
The number of multi-gap DTUs (MDTUs) in the corpora documented inGraca et al (2008) range from 3?11 (in a 100 sen-tences) with an average of 5.8.
Exact results foreach formalism that include double-sided DTUs andmultigap DTUs will be included in a future publi-cation, but it is clear to us that both configurationsare less frequent than inside-out alignments and CD-TUs.
In the Danish?Spanish parallel corpus thenumber of DTUs with three or more gaps is 448 outof which 182 are CDTUs.
In the English?Germanparallel corpus, the numbers are, resp., 2,529 and996.6It was recently suggested to us by a colleague that the lowerbounds need not be additive.
It is, theoretically, possible thatthe errors associated with CDTUs subsume some of the errorsassociated with inside-out alignments, i.e.
that it is possible toremove one alignment or translation unit from the Gold standardalignment structure such that both the CDTU-ms count goesdown by one, and the inside-out alignment count goes down byone.
It is left for future work to estimate this bias, but it seemsto us that such subsumptions will be infrequent.256 Related workZens and Ney (2003) used GIZA++ to word-alignthe Verbmobil task (English and German) and theCanadian Hansards task (English and French) andtested the coverage of ITGs and xITGs, i.e.
the ratioof the number of alignment configurations that couldbe induced by the theories and the sentences in thetwo tasks.
The results are presented below:ITG xITGVerbmobil (G?E) 91.6% 96.5%Verbmobil (E?G) 87.0% 96.9%Can.
Hansards (F?E) 81.3% 96.1%Can.
Hansards (E?F) 73.6% 95.6%Note that the average differences in coverage be-tween ITGs and xITGs for English-German (7.4%)and English?French (18.4%) are comparable tothe DTUs/TUs ratios for English?German (7.4%),resp.
English?French (10.1%) in our parallel cor-pora.
Compare also the average error rate ofxITGs for English and German (3.3%) and Englishand French (4.15%) to the CDTU-ms/TUs ratiosfor English?German (3.0%) and English?French(4.1%).This data provides strong support that inside-outalignments and cross-serial DTUs are the main the-oretical challenge for syntax-based machine trans-lation; in addition, training is a major challenge(Zhang and Gildea, 2004).
In real-life applications,AERs and TUERs will be significantly higher thanthe empirical lower bounds obtained here, e.g.
40%for Chinese?English in Zhang and Gildea (2004),but in principal future results should converge onthem.7 DiscussionIn machine translation, as in all other branches ofcomputer science, there is a trade-off between ex-pressivity and complexity.
The results presentedhere, namely that classes of alignment structures ex-cluded by syntax-based translation systems, occurfrequently in hand-aligned parallel corpora, couldbe taken to indicate that more expressive formalismsare needed.
This at least seems to be the case to theextent alignment error rates are reasonable measuresof the adequacy of syntax-based machine translationsystems.
On the other hand parsing complexities insyntax-based machine translation are very high al-ready, i.e.
O(|G|n6) and higher.
Consequently, itis not advisable to gain more expressivity at the ex-pense of parsing complexity.
This need not be nec-essary either, however.
There are at least two otherpossibilities:?
Either the cake can be cut differently, i.e.
to ex-clude other classes of alignment structures thatoccur less frequently.
This idea has to the bestof our knowledge not been explored in the con-text of syntax-based machine translation.?
It is also possible to design formalisms forsyntax-based machine translation that induceall possible alignment structures and maintaina reasonable parsing complexity (O(|G|n6)),e.g.
S?gaard (2008b); but as noted byS?gaard (2008a) the gain in expressivity isat the expense of the complexity of learn-ing.
Finally, it can be shown that there areno computable tight estimators for the proba-bilistic extension of the formalism introducedin S?gaard (2008b).78 ConclusionIt was shown how the frequency of certain classes ofalignment structures induce empirical lower boundson the alignment error rates that can be obtainedwith these systems.
Some of these lower boundsare quite significant, e.g.
14.7% (TUER) for ITGswrt.
Danish?Spanish and 17.6% wrt.
Portuguese-French.
Slightly lower, but still significant, boundsexist for more complex formalisms such as 2-STSGsand 2-STAGs.7Two other challenges for this type of approach are: (i)The use of intersection in S?gaard (2008b) to induce inside-out alignments and cross-serial DTUs seems to miss importantgeneralizations; see Chiang (2004) for a similar point in thecontext of parsing.
(ii) If the class of alignment structures is re-stricted in any natural way, i.e.
to 1 : 1 alignments, the problemwhether there exists a possible alignment given two sentencesand a grammar becomes NP-hard (S?gaard, 2009).
NB: Theundecidability of computing tight estimators was pointed out tous by Mark-Jan Nederhof (p.c.
), but Alexander Clark (p.c.)
andothers have suggested that pseudo-tight estimators can be usedin practice.26ReferencesAlfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman.
