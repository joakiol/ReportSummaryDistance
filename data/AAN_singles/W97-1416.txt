dkMay 14, 1997Computational models of referring such as those of Kronfeld (1990) andHeeman & Hirst (1995), being based on the view of language as goal-directedbehaviour, assume that the act of referring includes making the hearer ecognizethe speaker's communicative goal.
My present work centres on the question ofhow we recognize an expression as a referring expression, i.e.
how do we knowthat the use of a noun phrase is intended to indicate a particular object?
Work-ing in a Kronfeldian framework, I assume that referring consists of a "literalgoal" (making the hearer ecognize the np as a referring expression) and a "dis-course purpose" (making the hearer ecognize and apply the right "identificationconstraints", such as the requirement that the referent should be identified per-ceptually, or should be identified with an entity introduced at a previous tagein the discourse).
I propose that in some cases the recognition of the np as areferring expression depends on the recognition of the identification constraints.I work primarily with referring in the literary mode, looking for computation-ally manageable triggers uch as lexical anchorings and information derivablefrom knowledge of genre, but I am also concerned with the questions of whethera unified approach to referring is possible and the extent o which text-basedmodels can be generalized to a multimodal context.
