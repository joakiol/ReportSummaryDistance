Coling 2010: Demonstration Volume, pages 49?52,Beijing, August 2010Cloud Computing for LinguistsDorothee BeermannNorwegian University of Science and Technologydorothee.beermann@hf.ntnu.no pavel@ontotext.comPavel MihaylovOntotextAbstractThe system presented is a web applica-tion designed to aid linguistic researchwith data collection and online publish-ing.
It is a service mainly for linguistsand language experts working with lan-guage description of less-documented andless-resourced languages.
When the cen-tral concern is in-depth linguistic analy-sis, maintaining and administering soft-ware can be a burden.
Cloud computingoffers an alternative.
At present mainlyused for archiving, we extend linguisticweb applications to allow creation, searchand storage of interlinear annotated texts.By combining a conceptually appealingonline glosser with an SQL database anda wiki, we make the online publication oflinguistic data an easy task also for non-computationally oriented researchers.1 General description of TypeCraftTypeCraft (or TC in short) is a multilingual on-line database of linguistically-annotated naturallanguage texts, embedded in a collaboration andinformation tool.
It is an online service which al-lows users (projects as well as individuals) to cre-ate, store and retrieve structured data of the kindmainly used in natural language research.
In asystem featuring graded access the user may cre-ate his own domain, invite others, as well as sharehis data with the public.
The kernel of TypeCraftis morphological word level annotation in a rela-tional database setting, wrapped into a wiki whichis used as a communication and information gath-ering and sharing tool.
TypeCraft allows the im-port of raw text for storage and annotation andexport of annotated data to MS Word, OpenOf-fice.org, LATEX and XML.
The online system iscomplemented by an offline client which is a Javaapplication offering the same functionality as theonline version.
This allows a seamless exchangeof data between the server and the user?s owncomputer.2 Online system internalsThe online system is supported by a central serverrunning the following modules: TypeCraft serverproper, an SQL database, Apache, MediaWiki.The client side consists of the TypeCraft editor in-terface and a wiki environment (content producedby MediaWiki on the server).
Users perceive thewiki and the editor interface as a single TypeCraftweb application.The TypeCraft server proper is a Java appli-cation running inside a Java application server.TypeCraft uses a PostgreSQL database for datastorage.
The data mapping between Java ob-jects and database tables is managed by Hibernate,so the system is not bound to any specific SQLdatabase.
TypeCraft data can be divided into twodistinct groups: common data, shared between allannotated tokens and users, such as the word andsentence level tag sets and an ISO 639-3 speci-fication, and individual data, by which we meanspecific texts, phrases, words and morphemes.
In-dividual data references common data types.
Thisfor example means that all users of the systemmaking use of the part of speech tag N share thereference to a single common tag N.3 Digital linguistic dataIt is well known that generation of linguistic an-notation of any kind is a time consuming enter-prise quite independent of the form the primarydata has and the tools chosen for processing thisdata.
Equally well known are problems connectedto the generation and storage of linguistic data.49Standard word processing programs do not func-tion well as linguistic tools and private computersare not a safe place to store linguistic resources(Bird and Simons, 2003).
Although it is generallyagreed that linguistic resources should be kept ina sustainable and portable format, it is less clearwhat that really means in practice.
For the indi-vidual researcher it is not easy to decide whichof the available tools serve his purpose best.
Tostart with, it is often unclear which direction theresearch will take, which categories of data areneeded and in which form the material should beorganised and stored.
We experience that it is tootime consuming or requires expert knowledge toconvert otherwise useful data into an acceptable?resource format?.
It is perhaps even more impor-tant that many tools turn out to be so complex thatthe goal of mastering them becomes an issue inits own right.
Researchers working together withlocal communities on less-documented languagesexperience that linguistic software can be techni-cally too demanding.In fact, researchers in all non-computational fieldsof linguistics encounter problems similar to thosejust described for field-oriented research.
Con-cerned with timely publication, for which lin-guistic data mainly takes the form of InterlinearGlosses (IG), the efficiency with which linguisticdata can be created is an important issue.
Sev-eral factors will affect which form linguistic datamanagement will take, namely the standardisationof data beyond the field of NLP, non-expert userIT solutions allowing the efficient creation of lin-guistic data, and finally, improved availability oflinguistic data for human consumption in researchand publication.4 Linguistic services and publiclinguistic dataWithin linguistics the idea of cloud computing isrelatively new: the basic concept is that users ofdigital technology no longer need to maintain thesoftware they use, instead the maintenance of thetechnological infrastructure is left to services on-line.
Already a success in commercial applica-tions, IT services have also become a reality inresearch.
Within linguistics and specifically lan-guage documentation, cloud computing facilitiesare at present mainly restricted to online archives.Yet, online services can be extended to providetools for databasing and annotation of data.
Sci-entific data exchange is an issue in biochemistry(Leser, 2009), but as far as we know it has notbeen an issue in linguistics.
The question is notso much why we should share data but rather howand what.
The linguistic tool that we would liketo demonstrate gives a concrete answer to thesequestions.
Table 1 presents a short overview ofthe main functionalities of the TypeCraft web ap-plication.5 Creation, storage, migration andrepresentation of IGs in TypeCraftThe TypeCraft web application can be used on-line at http://www.typecraft.org/.
TheTC wiki serves as the central hub of the applica-tion.
The TC database is accessed through MyTexts which displays the user?s repository of IGcollections, called Texts.
My Texts is illustrated inFigure 1.
Graded access is one of the design prop-erties of TypeCraft.
My Texts has two sectionsconsisting of private data (data readable only bethe user), and shared data.
Shared data are Textsowned by groups of TC users.
After being as-signed to a group, the user can decide which datato share with which of his groups.
Data can alsobe made public so that anyone on the net can readand export (but not edit) it.TypeCraft is like the well known Linguist?sToolbox (International, 2010) an interlinearglosser.
However, different from Toolbox, Type-Craft is a relational database and therefore by na-ture has many advantages over file-based systemslike Toolbox; this not only concerns data integritybut also data migration.
In addition, databases ingeneral offer greater flexibility for search and re-trieval.
The other major difference between Tool-box and TypeCraft is that TypeCraft is an onlineservice which frees the users from all the prob-lems arising from maintaining an application ontheir own computer.
Online databases like Type-Craft are multiuser systems, i.e.
many people canaccess the same data at the same time indepen-dently of where they are located.
Users adminis-ter their own data, either in a private domain orpublicly, and they can make use of other users?50Table 1: Overview over TypeCraft FunctionalitiesAnnotation Collaboration Data Migrationsentence tokenisation graded access manual text importinteractive table cells tool internal user commu-nicationexport of annotatedphrases to MS Word,OpenOffice.org and LATEXLazy Annotation Mode user pages for backgroundinformationXML semi-automatic ex-port to the TC wikiextensive search function-alitysharing of data sets be-tween user groupsautomatic update of dataexported to the TC wikiFigure 1: My texts in TypeCraftdata.
Sharing information and data is an issue ofmutual interest.
Using standard wiki functional-ity, users discuss annotation issues.
A TC inter-nal email function allows users to communicatedirectly within the application.
User pages func-tion to personalise information and to create a TCuser community.
Social networking within a sci-entific tool plays a crucial role for the improve-ment of data validity.
Information given by an-notators, such as native language and professionalbackground, increase the trust in TC data.The TC wiki features interactive Google maps (aMediaWiki extension) which can be used to lo-cate a language geographically.
Isoglosses can beshown on the map too.It is not always possible to work online.
TheTC online database is complemented by the TCoffline client which can be downloaded from theproject website for free.
As a Java application itruns on multiple platforms, and allows the userto work offline in an environment familiar to himfrom the web application.
The offline client offersthe same functionality as the online service.
Theuser can import data either locally or from the cen-tral TC database.6 Glossing with TypeCraftTypeCraft supports word-to-word glossing oneight tiers.
After having imported a text and runit through a simple sentence splitter, the user can51click on a phrase and enter annotation mode.
Thesystem prompts the user for lazy annotation (inToolbox called sentence parsing) which will au-tomatically insert the annotation of already knownwords into the annotation table.The user is restricted to a set of predefined tagswhich can be accessed from the TC wiki navi-gation bar where they are automatically updatedwhen the database changes.
TypeCraft is a mul-tilingual database hosting languages from distinctlanguage families and grammar traditions.
It istherefore crucial to have standards that are ex-tendible.The TypeCraft tag set is mapped to the Gen-eral Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD).GOLD (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003) has beencreated to facilitate a more standardised use ofbasic grammatical features.
As an OWL ontol-ogy GOLD allows a representation of grammati-cal features in terms of categories and their rela-tions.
By mapping TC tags to GOLD, the usercan make use of the information in the GOLDsystem which allows him to relate tags to moregeneral grammatical concepts.
The TypeCraft?GOLD mapping allows the user direct access tostandards and necessary background informationto associate glosses with the grammatical cate-gories they are meant to express.
GOLD in manycases provides definitions of concepts and impor-tant bibliographic resources related to the use ofthe term.Annotated TC tokens can be exported to Mi-crosoft Word, OpenOffice.org Writer and LATEX.Example (1) is exported to LATEX from TypeCraft.It illustrates locative relativisation in Runyakitara,a Bantu language spoken in Uganda:(1)Omu nju ei abagyenyi baataahiremu ekasya?m?

In this pa-per we have presented an online linguistic servicewhich allows the creation, storage and retrieval ofIGs, thus granting them the status of an indepen-dent language resource.
Reusability of data hasbecome an issue also in the non-computationalfields of linguistics.
Although not sufficiently re-warded at the moment, already now the creationand sharing of linguistic data online is an efficientway for the creation and propagation of annotatedtexts in form of Interlinear Glosses.
Since theTypeCraft web application provides off-the-shelfdata for linguistic publications already formattedfor all main text processing systems, data creationand retrieval with TypeCraft is time efficient.
Thismakes linguistic work more data oriented and en-ables reasonable scientific turnover rate.ReferencesBird, Steven and Gary Simons.
