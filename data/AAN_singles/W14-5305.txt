Word forms are analyzed by a set of cascaded finite state transducers which split the wordsand rewrite the morphemes to a normalized form.
However, some of these morphemes, or rathermorpheme combinations, are ambiguous, which may affect the normalization.
For this reason,we disambiguate the morpheme sequences with conditional random fields.
Once we know theindividual morphemes of a word, we can generate the normalized word form from the disam-biguated morphemes.11 IntroductionAs part of our research project we have developed several tools and resources for Cuzco Quechua.
Thisincludes a hybrid machine translation system Spanish-Quechua.
The core system is a classical rule-basedtransfer engine, that we aim to improve with the addition of statistical modules.An issue that is generally difficult to deal with in a rule-based approach is the lexical choice of trans-lation options: writing context rules for every possible translation of a given input word is not feasible.Another solution is to include a language model, trained on Quechua texts, that can handle the lexicaldisambiguation.
The total number of available Quechua texts is relatively small, and to complicate mat-ters even further, these texts are written in a wide range of different orthographies.
Therefore, the firststep in order to obtain a language model is the normalization of the different spellings into a standard-ized orthography.
Not every morphological ambiguity needs to be disambiguated for the normalizationalone, but we need fully disambiguated texts for other applications (e.g.
parsing).
Therefore, we choseto disambiguate not only the cases that are relevant for the normalization, but all types of morphologicalambiguities.2 Related WorkIn general, almost every automatic processing of agglutinative languages relies on a correct morphologi-cal analysis.
Extensive research on morphological disambiguation has been done on Turkish: G?org?un etal.
(2011) used the WEKA toolkit to train and test several classifiers.
With over 50,000 disambiguatedsentences for training, they achieved 95.6% accuracy with the J48 Tree algorithm.Hakkani-T?ur et al.
(2002) trained an N-gram language model on Turkish roots and another model onso called inflectional groups (groups of morphemes), and used a combination of these two models todisambiguate the output of their finite state analyzer.
With a training set of almost 700,000 tokens, theyachieved 93.95% accuracy.Sak et al.
(2007) use the combined language models from Hakkani-T?ur et al.
(2002) to produce an n-best list of morphological parses for a given Turkish sentence.
In a second step, they rank the candidateswith the voted Perceptron algorithm, trained on 42,000 disambiguated tokens.
With this additional step,they achieved an accuracy of 96.8%.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

An approach such as the one described by G?org?un et al.
(2011), where the classifierlearns to assign a class for each possible combination of morphemes (without the root), is therefore notfeasible: the number of classes that can be learned from such a small training set will not suffice toclassify unseen data.
Similarly, a language model, even if trained on units smaller than words, as doneby Hakkani-T?ur et al.
(2002), will not overcome the data sparseness in the training set.For this reason, the approach presented in this paper attempts to break down the disambiguation pro-cess into several smaller steps: we move from the root to the last suffix, disambiguating only one mor-pheme class at a time.
With this approach, we achieve an accuracy that is comparable to the results forTurkish.3 QuechuaQuechua is a language family spoken in the Andes by 8-10 million people in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador,Southern Colombia and the North-West of Argentina.
Although Quechua is often referred to as a lan-guage and its local varieties as dialects, Quechua is a language family, comparable in depth to the Ro-mance or Slavic languages (Adelaar and Muysken, 2004, 168).
Mutual intelligibility, especially betweenspeakers of distant ?dialects?, is not always given.In this project, we work with Cuzco Quechua (Southern Quechua), and in the following sections, thename Quechua is meant to refer explicitely to this variety.
The number of available texts in this partic-ular dialect is limited, therefore we have to include texts from other (similar) varieties of the SouthernQuechua dialect group, such as Ayacucho and Bolivian Quechua.3.1 Dialectal and Orthographic Variation within the Southern Quechua dialect group (QIIC)Apart from lexical differences, there is one major dialectal divergence between the Cuzco/Bolivian di-alects on one side, and the Ayacucho/Argentina varieties on the other side: Cuzco/Bolivian Quechua has,like Aymara, a three way distinction of stops (plain, glottalized and aspirated), whereas Ayacucho andArgentina Quechua have only plain stops.
Furthermore, some suffixes appear in different forms, e.g.
theprogressive in Ayacucho is marked by -chka, in Cuzco by -sha, and in Bolivia by -sa or -sya.
Othersuffixes are restricted to a particular variety: some dialects that are in close contact with Aymara, such asthe Quechua spoken in Puno, have borrowed a number of Aymara suffixes, e.g.
-thapi, -t?a, -naqa, thatare unknown in other dialects (Adelaar, 1987).Additionally, there are some morphotactic differences concerning the combination of suffixes: forinstance, a number of Quechua suffixes change their vowel in combination with certain suffixes, but theexact contexts that induce this vowel change differ to some extent across dialects.
Furthermore, the orderof suffixes in combinations can vary.Apart from the dialectal differences, there is also a wide range of orthographic variation within theSouthern Quechua dialect group.
Several standards have been proposed, most notably the standardizedorthography as defined by Cerr?on-Palomino (1994).
This standard has been adopted by the Boliviangovernment (Villarroel, 2000), with one small adaption: in Bolivia, the glottal fricative [h] is written as /j/instead of /h/.
In Peru, the situation is slightly more complicated: Although the Ministry of Education hasdefined an official standard orthography2,there is still some disagreement regarding the correct spellingof Quechua words.
Also, many Quechua texts are written in a more or less Spanish orthography, wherefor instance /wa/ is written as /hua/, and /ki/ is written as /qui/.
Table 1 illustrates the orthography of theAcademia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua in Cuzco (first row), a typical ?Spanish?
spelling (second row)and an old, non-standardized Bolivian spelling (last row), as opposed to the unified standard orthographyas defined by Cerr?on-Palomino (1994).
This is the orthography that we use for normalization.2As declared in the Resoluci?on Ministerial No1218-85-ED de 198540AMLQ mana qelqaq yachaq ?nausa qelqa runasimipi kasqanku rayku...norm.

There are over 130 Quechua suffixes, the exact number,as well as the form of the suffixes exhibit substantial variation across dialects.
There are five func-tional classes of Quechua suffixes: nominalizing (noun?verb) and verbalizing (verb?noun), nominal(noun?noun) and verbal (verb?verb) suffixes and so-called independent or ambiguous suffixes, that canbe attached to both verbal or nominal forms, without altering the part of speech.
The position of thesesuffixes is at the end of the suffix sequence, their relative order is more or less fixed, though dialects showminor variations.
The functions of the independent suffixes include data source, polar question markingand topic or contrast, amongst others (Adelaar and Muysken, 2004, 208).Quechua roots are, apart from a small number of particles, either verbal or nominal.
Adjectives donot constitute a word class on their own on a morphological level, as they behave exactly the same asnominal roots.
There may be some syntactic restrictions on true adjectives (Adelaar and Muysken, 2004,208), but these can be ignored for a morphological analysis.
Many roots are indeed ambiguous and canbe used either as noun or verb without any derivational suffixes:3(1) takisong/sing-y-1S.ps?My song?
(2) takisong/sing-ni.-1S?I sing?Furthermore, nominalizing (NS) and verbalizing (VS) suffixes are very productive and can occur morethan once in a word.We obtain the morphological analysis from a finite state analyzer that splits the word forms into mor-phemes, and also normalizes the surface form of the morphemes.
Roots are mapped to their standardizedform according to Cerr?on-Palomino (1994), e.g.
the word for brain, ?nutq?u in the standard, may appearas nushqun, ?nusqhun, ?nusq?un, ?nusqun or ?nutqun, depending on the dialect.
The normalizer rewrites allthese variants to ?nutq?u.
The normalizer also rewrites the form of certain suffixes, see Table 2.Some of these suffixes are ambiguous in their non-standardized forms, e.g.
the direct evidential suffix,written as -n, could also be a third person singular marker (verbal or nominal).
In order to generate the3Abbreviations used in glosses: Acc: accusative, Add: additive, Dim: diminutive, DirE: direct evidential, Fact: factitive,Fut: future tense, IndE: indirect evidential, Inf: infinitive, Imp: imperative, Loc: locative, NS: nominalizing, P: plural, Perf:perfect, ps: possessive, Rflx: reflexive, S: singular, Top: topic, VS: verbalizing41Joven Gregorio Cancioneronormalizer 97.86% 73.00% 42.56%Spanish strict 0.64% 21.87% 15.86%normalizer relax - - 34.88%Spanish relax - 0.30% 1.48%guesser 1.02% 2.36% 3.65%total coverage 99.52% 97.64% 98.43%unknown words 0.48% 2.46% 1.58%Table 3: Morphological Analysis Coveragenormalized form of a word with a suffix -n, we need to know whether this particular -n is a person markeror an evidential suffix.
Only in the latter case, -n needs to be rewritten as -m during normalization.We have two normalizers in our pipeline: the first one handles text in ?regular?
orthographies that showsome minor dialectal variations.
The second normalizer allows for more ?extreme?
orthographies: Forinstance, both [k] and [q] (velar and postvelar stops) are pronounced as fricatives in certain positions([x] and [X]).
In many texts both are written as /j/ (or sometimes /h/) if pronounced as fricatives.
Thisintroduces new ambiguities, for instance, a root written as sajsa could be saqsa - ?certain variety of corn?or saksa - ?satisfied,full?.
In order to avoid additional ambiguities resulting from an analysis with relaxedorthographic rules, the transducer with the additional orthographic rules handles only word forms thatwere not recognized by the standard normalizer.As most Quechua texts contain Spanish words, we included two additional finite state transducers thatrecognize Quechua words with Spanish roots.4.
The first one recognizes only word forms with correctlywritten Spanish roots, whereas the second transducer includes several rules that allow for an alternativespelling of the Spanish words (e.g.
/c/ might be written as /k/ in a Quechua text).
Furthermore, weimplemented a guesser that attempts to split word forms into morphemes if the root is unknown.
In orderto prevent highly unlikely analyses, we restrict the guessing to roots of at least two syllables and with atleast one Quechua suffix attached.The five transducers are joined in a cascade: If the normalizer fails to analyze a word, the Spanishtransducer is invoked.
If this fails as well, the word is passed on to the second normalizer with relaxedorthography.
If the word form has still no analysis, the second Spanish transducer with relaxed orthog-raphy attempts to find an analysis.
Finally, if all transducers failed, the word is handed to the guesser.One of the texts used for evaluation, a story called El joven que se subi?o al cielo (Lira, 1990) containsrelatively few words with Spanish roots, but in the other text, the biography of Quechua native speakerGregorio Condori Mamani, almost every sentence contains at least one word with a Spanish root.
In thiscase, the Spanish transducer makes a considerable difference: coverage increases by ?22%, see Table3.
Furthermore, we tested the morphological analyzers on a third text, Cancionero, with an even moreinconsistent spelling of Quechua words.
The Cancionero contains religious (catholic) songs written in a?Spanish?
orthography, see the ?Spanish?
example in Table 1.
The restrictive Quechua and Spanish ana-lyzers recognize only half of the word forms in this text, but the transducers with broader orthographicrules (?relax?)
increase the number of analyzed tokens to 96%, see Table 3.5 DisambiguationGiven the fact that a Quechua word form can contain more than one morphological ambiguity, the dis-ambiguation has to be done in several steps.
The simplest approach is to disambiguate each word formfrom ?left to right?:?
disambiguate the root (nominal vs. verbal)?
disambiguate nominalizing and verbalizing suffixes?
disambiguate verbal suffixes54The lexicon contains all the Spanish lemmas, except function words, from FreeLing (Padr?o and Stanilovsky, 2012)5There are no ambiguous sequences within the nominal suffixes, therefore the third step involves only verbal suffixes.42suwa suwa[NRoot][=ladr?on]papanchikta papa[NRoot][=patata][--]nchik[NPers][+1.Pl.Incl.Poss][--]ta[Cas][+Acc]tukunqa tuku[NRoot][=lechuza][--]n[NPers][+3.Sg.Poss][--]qa[Amb][+Top]tukunqa tuku[VRoot][=acabar]][--]n[VPers][+3.Sg.Subj][--]qa[Amb][+Top]tukunqa tuku[VRoot][=acabar][--]nqa[VPers][+3.Sg.Subj.Fut]Figure 1: Ambiguous Morphological Analysis for Example 3possible lemmas case possible root tags possible morph tagssuwa lc NRoot -papa lc NRoot +1.Pl.Incl.Poss, +Acctuku lc NRoot, VRoot +3.Sg.Poss, +Top, +3.Sg.Subj, +3.Sg.Subj.FutTable 4: Features for Disambiguation with Wapiti, Example 3?
disambiguate independent suffixesWe use Wapiti (Lavergne et al., 2010), a toolkit for sequence labelling that includes an implementationof conditional random fields, in order to train 4 crf models (one model for each step).
We decided to useconditional random fields, as the task of morphology disambiguation is in many ways similar to PoStagging.
There is an inter-dependency between the labels: The decision which label a given instanceshould receive depends to certain extent on the labels of the previous n instances.The training material consists of two Quechua texts that were analyzed with the xfst tools (see section4) and then manually disambiguated: the biography of Quechua native speaker Gregorio Condori Ma-mani (Valderrama Fernandez and Escalante Gutierrez, 1977), that contains about 2500 sentences, andsome stories from a collection (Lira, 1990), that amount to about 300 sentences.5.1 Model 1: Disambiguation of Ambiguous RootsSome Quechua roots can be used nominally or verbally without derivation, see Example 1 and 2.
Thedisambiguation of roots can be regarded as PoS tagging with a very small tagset.
Consider the followingexample (taken from a story in (Lira, 1990)):(3) ..suwathiefpapapotato-nchik-1P.ps-ta-Acctukuend-nqa..-3S.Fut?[..]
the thief will take all our potatoes [..] (lit.
?the thief will end our potatoes?
)The root tuku- ?to end?
is ambiguous: tuku- can also be a nominal root with the meaning ?owl?.Furthermore, the sequence -nqa is ambiguous, apart from the 3rd singular future form, it could be acombination of -n, ?3rd singular subject?
or ?3rd singular possessive?, and -qa, ?topic?, see Fig.
1 withthe output of the xfst analyzer for this example.
In a first step, the type of the root has to be determined,the ambiguity of -nqa is only relevant if the root is verbal and will be postponed for later.
In order todisambiguate the root with Wapiti, every token needs to be converted into a set of features (an instance)extracted from the xfst output, see Table 4.
The words suwa and papanchikta are not ambiguous andtherefore have only one possible root tag, whereas tukunqa has two possible root tags: VRoot and NRoot.Model 1 will assign one of them as class label, considering the features and the context of the given token.Wapiti allows pre-labeled input data, therefore, we can already set the label of the unambiguous wordssuwa and papanchikta.
Note that the instances do not contain the full word form; due to the small sizeof our training corpus, using full word forms leads to increased data sparseness and impairs the results.5.2 Model 2: Disambiguation of Nominalizing and Verbalizing SuffixesEven after the disambiguation of the root type, the final word form can still be either nominal or verbal,as certain nominalizing and verbalizing suffixes are homophonous with verbal or nominal morphemes.43Consider the following examples:(4) wasihouse-cha-Fact(VS)-y-Inf(NS)/2.Imp?to build a house?
or ?build a house!?
(5) rikhusee-sqa-Perf(NS)-yki-2S.ps?the one you saw, your seeing?wasihouse-cha-Dim-y-1S.ps?my small house, cottage?rikhusee-sqayki-1S>2S.Fut?I will see you?The suffix -cha attached to a nominal root can be either a diminutive or a factitive suffix (?make?
):With the diminutive, the resulting word form is still a noun, whereas the factitive suffix produces a verb.In total, model 2 handles eight different cases of ambiguous verbalizing/nominalizing vs. verbal/nominalsuffixes.
The features in models 2-4 are essentially the same as those in model 1 (see Table 4), but ofcourse the root type is no longer ambiguous, consequently there is only one root tag.
With models 2-4,we classify only words that exhibit a verbalizing/nominalizing vs. nominal/verbal ambiguity, whereaswords that are unambiguous for the particular model receive a dummy label (?none?
).5.3 Model 3: Disambiguation of Verbal MorphologyIn the next step, we disambiguate six possible ambiguities in verb forms.
One of the ambiguities inquestion is the sequence -nqa from example 3: After applying model 1, we know that the root tuku intukunqa is verbal, but -nqa can still be either the 3rd singular future form or a combination of 3rd singularpresent and topic marker, see example 6.
Other ambiguities of this type involve -sun, which can be eitherthe imperative or future form of the first plural inclusive, as well as the sequence -sqaykiku, which canbe either the indirect past or future form of the first plural exclusive acting on a 2nd singular person.
(6) tukuend-nqa-3S.Fut?he will end?tukuend-n-3S-qa-Top?he ends?
(7) llamk?awork-sun-1Pl.incl.Fut?we will work?llamk?awork-sun-1Pl.incl.Imp?let?s work?
(8) qhawalook-sqaykiku-1Pl.excl.>2S?we (excl.)
watch you?qhawalook-sqa-IPst-ykiku-1Pl.excl?we (excl.)
watched [theysay]?5.4 Model 4: Disambiguation of Independent SuffixesModel 4 disambiguates ambiguities that concern independent suffixes.
None of these potential ambigu-ities occur in all dialects and orthographies, but all of them concern the normalization and are thereforeimportant.
There are 3 types of ambiguities that relate to independent suffixes:The most common case involves the suffix -n, when the word form is nominal and -n follows a vowel:in this case, -n can be the 3rd singular possessive, or it can be the allomorph of the evidential suffix-mi.
The latter is written as -m in the standard orthography, as well as in texts written in AyacuchoQuechua, but occurs as -n in many texts written in Cuzco and Bolivian Quechua, see Example 9.
Afurther ambiguity that occurs only in Cuzco and Bolivian Quechua concerns the sequence -pis: -pis canbe the additive suffix (in Ayacucho Quechua always -pas) or a combination of the locative suffix -pi andthe evidential suffix -s, see Example 10.
The third ambiguity of this type concerns Spanish words thatend in -s: In this case, -s can be an evidential suffix, but it can also be the Spanish plural6, see Example11.6In certain Bolivian dialects -s is also used on native roots as plural suffix, see the Bolivian word p?achasta (normalizedp?achakunata) in Table 1.44gregorio jovenmodel 1 root tag Wapiti 95.35 85.71baseline 65.12 72.62model 2 NS/VS Wapiti 97.44 87.88baseline 80.49 17.47model 3 verbal s.

Both test texts were excluded from the training set.Table 5 illustrates the percentage of correctly disambiguated words with the particular ambiguity foreach step.
Note that there were only a handful test cases for model 3 (verbal suffixes) in both texts, there-fore, the results for this step might not be accurate.
Furthermore, the number of instances extracted fromthe training material for model 3 is smaller than for the other models, as these types of ambiguities arerelatively rare.
For the normalization, errors in model 3 do not affect the outcome, as these ambiguitieshave no effect on the surface forms in the standard orthography.
Considering for instance example 6,-nqa will be -nqa in the standard, irrespective of whether the analysis is -n -qa or -nqa.Table 6 contains the evaluation of the whole texts.
Although the percentage of tokens with a wrongmorphological analysis is almost the same in both texts, the total number of correctly analyzed wordsis lower in the biography.
This is due to the fact that this text contains many words with Spanish roots,sometimes with ?quechuized?
spelling.
Many of these words were not recognized by the xfst analyzerand were therefore not normalized.The baseline for both Table 5 and 6 was calculated based on the frequencies of the forms in the trainingmaterial: The baseline shows the results that we obtain if we disambiguate the test texts choosing alwaysthe most frequent class in every decision.
The biggest difference as opposed to the Wapiti models isthat with this approach, we do not consider any context information.
As you can see in Table 5, Wapitioutperforms the baseline in every step except for model 3, where the training instances are too sparse.There is a considerable difference in the baseline for the two test texts (see Table 6): on the biography,the baseline is much higher.
This is due to the fact that the largest part of the training material is part ofthe same book, therefore the probability distribution of the individual classes in this test text correlatesbetter with the frequencies calculated from the training material.
While the conditional random fieldsimprove the disambiguation on the test set similar to training material only slightly compared to thebaseline (+2%), the effect they have on the results for a test set from a different text is considerable:>10%.
Table 6 also contains the results obtained with the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) andMorfette (Grzegorz et al., 2008) for comparison.
The main difference between our approach and themorphological taggers is that the latter analyze and label the complete word form at once, whereas withour approach, we disambiguate and normalize each word in several steps, proceeding from left to right.The tagset used by the morphological taggers is thus much more fine-grained, as each tag contains the45El joven que subi?o al cielo Gregorio Condori Mamanitotal sentences: 258 72total token 1865 1015punctuation marks: 567 171xfst failures: 9 0.48% 25 2.46%total word forms 1298 844correct analysis: 1252 96.46% 789 93.48%wrong analysis: 33 2.54% 17 2.01%guessed, no analysis in gold: 4 0.31% 6 0.71%ambiguous words: 282 21.73% 127 15.05%still ambiguous: 0 7 5.51%correct of ambig.

The results show clearly that our training corpus is too small to achievesatisfactory results with morphological tagging.
As mentioned before, not all ambiguities are relevantfor the normalization.
In fact, many morphological ambiguities are not relevant for the conversion to thestandard orthography, therefore, the number of correctly normalized forms is higher than the proportionof correctly disambiguated words from Table 6.
In the text El joven que subi?o al cielo, the percentage ofcorrectly normalized words amounts to 99.61%, whereas for the biography of Gregorio Condori Mamani,we achieve only 98.93%.7 ConclusionsAs standardized spelling is an indispensable prerequisite for any statistical processing, we built a pipelineto normalize Quechua texts through morphological analysis and disambiguation.
The morphologicalanalysis includes 5 cascaded transducers, two with Quechua root lexica and two with Spanish root lex-ica, as Spanish loan words occur very frequently in Quechua texts.
In every pair of transducers, the firstone follows a relatively strict orthography, whereas the second one has a set of phonological rules thatallow for more variation in the spelling of word forms.
Furthermore, the cascade includes a guesser thatattempts to split word forms into morphemes if all the other transducers failed to do so.
The transduc-ers rewrite the individual morphemes according to the Unified Southern Quechua orthography (Cerr?on-Palomino, 1994), but many words involve morphological ambiguities that might affect the normalizedform.
In order to choose the correct analysis, we conduct a morphological disambiguation with condi-tional random fields.
We disambiguate the Quechua words in 4 steps, with four models trained to classifythe different types of ambiguities.
Finally, we generate the normalized word forms from the now disam-biguated sequence of morphemes.
Our initial results are comparable to morphological disambiguation onTurkish texts, despite the fact that we have a much smaller training corpus (?
2800 sentences, comparedto over 50,000 (G?org?un and Yildiz, 2011) and 45,000 sentences (Sak et al., 2007)).
A possible explana-tion is that Turkish morphology is more complex: Turkish has more productive suffixes than Quechua,and there are relatively complex morpho-phonological rules that determine word formation, such as twodimensional vowel harmony and context-sensitive realizations of consonants (Oflazer, 1994).
Quechuaon the other hand, is a very regular agglutinative language.Certain parts of the disambiguation pipeline suffer from data sparseness, in fact, at least one possibleambiguous sequence never occurred in our training corpus and can therefore not be disambiguated, seesection 5.4.
As the annotation of our treebanks proceeds, we will have more manually disambiguatedtext, since the syntax trees are built on morphemes, not on whole words.
With more training material,the accuracy of the disambiguation and normalization process should increase.46ReferencesWillem F. H. Adelaar and Pieter Muysken.
