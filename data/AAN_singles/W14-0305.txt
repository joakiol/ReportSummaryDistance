Invited Talk ?Translators in the Loop: Understanding How they Work with CAT ToolsMaureen Ehrensberger-DowInstitute of Translation and InterpretingZurich University of Applied SciencesSwitzerlandehre@zhaw.chAbstractThe research that we have been carrying out at translators?
workplaces over the past few years has pro-vided indications that some CAT tools are not being used to their full potential or are even being ignoredby the users they were (or should have been) designed for.
Since by nature humans seem to resist chang-ing habits and procedures that do the job, it is easy to attribute that to the intransigence of older translatorsand shift the focus to designing new tools for digital natives.
However, the cognitive demands of pro-cessing complex input in one language while producing and revising and/or assessing and revising outputin another add a new dimension to the usual considerations of the human-machine loop of interaction,which may be independent of the translators?

In fact, the productivity constraints thatmany professional translators work under means that they might be adjusting more to their tools thanadjusting their tools?

performance.
And if those tools have notbeen designed to meet their users?
cognitive and physical ergonomic needs, their use may actually slowdown the translation process and have potentially detrimental effects on quality.Maureen Ehrensberger-Dow is a Canadian psycholinguist who has been involved in research into multi-lingualism and translation in Switzerland for the past 15 years.
