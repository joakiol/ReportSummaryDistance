esAbst ractExtensively annotated bilingual parallel corporacan be exploited to feed editing tools that in-tegrate the processes of document compositionand translation.
Here we discuss the archi-tecture of an interactive diting tool that, ontop of techniques common to most TranslationMemory-based systems, applies the potential ofSGML's DTDs to guide the process of bilingualdocument generation.
Rather than employingjust simple task-oriented mark-up, we selected aset of TEI's highly complex and versatile collec-tion of tags to help disclose the underlying log-ical structure of documents in the test-corpus.DTDs were automatically induced and later in-tegrated in the editing tool to provide the basicscheme for new documents.1 In t roduct ionThis paper discusses an approach to the archi-tecture of an experimental interactive ditingtool that integrates the processes of source doc-ument composition and translation i to the tar-get language.
The tool has been conceived as anoptimal solution for a particular case of bilin-gual production of legal documentation, but italso illustrates in a more general way how to ex-ploit the possibilities of SGML (ISO8879, 1986)used extensively to annotate a whole range oflinguistic and extralinguistic information i  spe-cialized bilingual corpora.SGML is well established as the codingscheme underlying most Translation Memorybased systems (TMBS), and has been pro-posed as the cod-it~g scheme for the interchangeof existing Translation Memory databasesTranslation Meinories eXchange, TMX (Melby,1998).
The advantages of SGML have also beenperceived by a large conmmnity of corpus lin-guistics researchers, and big efforts have beenmade in the development of suitable markupoptions to encode a variety of textual types andfunctions -as clearly demonstrated by the TextEncoding Initiative, TEI; (Burnard & Speberg-MacQueen, 1995).
While the tag-sets employedby TMBS are simple and task-oriented, TEI hasoffered a highly complex and versatile collectionof tags.
The guiding hypothesis in our experi-ment has been the idea that it is possible toexplore TEI/SGML markup in order to developa system that carries the concept of TranslationMemory one step further.
One important lea-ture of SGML is the DTD.
DTDs determine thelogical structure of documents and how to tagthem accordingly.
We have concentrated on theaccurate description of documents by means ofTEI conformant SGML markup.
The markupwill help disclose the underlying logical struc-ture of documents.
From annotated ocumen-tation, DTDs can be induced and these DTDsprovide the basic scheme to produce new doc-uments.
We have collected a corpus of officialpublications from three main institutions in theBasque Autonomous Region in Spain, the Bo-letln Oficial de Bizkaia (BOB, 1990-1995), Bo-tetln Oficial de Alava (BOA, 1990-1994) andBolet{n Oficial del Pais Vasco (BOPV, 1995).Documents in the corpus were composed by Ad-nfinistration clerks and translated by transla-tors.
Both clerks and translators have been us-ing a wide variety of word-processors, althoughsince 1994 MSWord has been generalized as thestandard editing tool.
Administrative docu-mentation shows a regular structure, and is rich?
in*recurrent textual patterns.
For each docu- .....ment type different document okens share acommon global distribution of elements.
Of-ficial document composers learn these globalstructures and apply them consistently.
It isalso the case that composers tend to reuse old32Document TypeOrden FormDecreto..Foral =--ResolucidnExtractoAcuerdoNorma ForalAnuncio%53%..22%,;-13%5.4%3.4%1.9%0.4%documents, where the whole document maybe considered the translation unit.

Goodsoftware packages for TM1 and TM3 already ex-ist in the market, and hence their exploitation isTable I:document files when producing new documentsof the same type.
Despite the fact that noSGML software was used at the editing phase,texts in the corpus show regular logical struc-tures and consistent distribution of text seg-ments.
Our main goal in tagging the corpus wasto make all them explicit (Martinez, 1997).
Themost common type of document in the corpus,the Orden Foral, was chosen (see Table 1).
Weanalysed some 100 tokens and hand-marked themost salient elements.
The heuristics to identifythese elements were later expressed in a collec-tion of recognition routines in Perl and testedagainst a set of 400 tokens, including the initial100.
As a result of this process of automatictagging of structural elements we produced aTE I /SGML tagged corpus with yet no corre-sponding overt DTD.
In  Section 2 we will ex-plain how DTDs were later induced from thetagged corpus.Once the corpus was segmented the next stepwas to align it.
This was conducted at differentlevels: general document elements (DIV, SEG,P), as well as sentential and intra-sentential e -ements, such as S, ItS, NUM, DATE, etc.
(Mar-tinez, 1998b).
Aligned in this way, the corpusbecomes an important resource for translation.Four complementary language databases maybe obtained at any time from the annotatedcorpus: three translation memory databases(TM1, TM2, and TM3) as well as a terminologydatabase (termbase).
The three TMs differ inthe nature of the translation units they contain.TM1 consists of aligned sentences than can feedcommercial TM software.
TM2 contains ele-ments which are translation segments rangingfrom whole sections of a document or multi-sentence paragraphs to smaller units, such asshort phrases or proper names.
TM3 simplyhosts the whole collection of aligned bilingualTypes of documents in the corpus beyond our interest (Trados Translator's Work-.

The originality of ourediting tool lies in a design which benefits fromjoining the potentiality of DTDs  and the ele-ments in TM2, as will be shown in sections 4and 5.2 DTD abst rac t ionSGML mark-up determines the logical structureof a document and its syntax in the form of acontext-free grammar.
This is called the Doc-ument Type Definition (DTD) and it containsspecifications for:?
Names and content for all elements that arepermitted to appear in a document.o Order in which these elements must ap-pear.o Tag attributes with default values for thoseelements.DTDs have been abstracted away from the an-notations that were automatically introducedin the corpus.
Similar experiments have beenreported before in the literature.
(Ahonen,1995) uses a method to build document in-stances from tagged texts that consists of a de-terministic finite automaton for each contextmodel.
Subsequently, these automata re gen-eralized and converted into regular expressionswhich are easily transcribed into SGML contentmodels.
(Shafer, 1995) combines docmnent in-stances with simplification rules.
Our methodis similar to  Sharer's, but .with a.modificationin the way rules reduce document instances.
Atool to obtain a DTD for all document instanceshas been developed (Casillas, 1999).
Given thatsource and target documents how some syn-tactic and structural mismatches, two differentDTDs are induced, one for each language, and33Spanish Text:<div0><div l> ... < /d iv l><seg9 id=9ES2 corresp=gEU2> Contra dicha<rs  type=law id=LES12 corresp=LEU10>Orden Foral </ rs>,  que agota la vfa ad-ministrativa podr~i interponerse recursocontencioso-administrativo ante la <rstype=organization id=0ES9 corresp=0EUl i>Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tri-?

Cor-respondences in this table can be up-dated, ordeleted.
At present, we have six DTDs, one foreach document ype in each language (there arethree document ypes; Figure 2 shows a part ofone of these DTDs).
By means of these pairedDTDs, document elements in each language areappropriately placed.
In the process of gener-ating the bilingual document, a document ypemust first be selected.
Each document ype hasan associated DTD.
This DTD specifies whichelements are obhgatory and.which are optional.With the aid of the DTD, the source documentis generated.
The target document will be gen-erated with .the aid of the com~esponding targetDTD.3 Jo in ing  TM2 and  DTDTM2 specifically stores a type of translationsegment class, which we have tagged <seg l>,<seg2>... <segn>, <t i t le> and <rs>,  andwhich is relevant o the DTD.
Segments tagged<segn> are variable recurrent language pat-terns very frequent in the specialized domainof the corpus and whose occurrence in the textis well established.
These <segn> tags in-clude two attributes: id  and cor respond whichlocate the aligned segment both in the cor-pus and in the database (Figure 1).
Seg-ments tagged <rs> are referring expressionswhich have been recognized, tagged and aligned?
and which correspond largely to proper names(Martinez, 1998a), (Martinez, 1998b).
TM2 ismanaged in tile form of a relational database-where segments are stored, as records.
.Eachrecord in the database consists of four fields:the segment string, a counter for the occur-rences of that string in the corpus, the tagand the attributes (type, id and corresp) .Table 2 shows how the text fragment inside34<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENTLEGE - - (TEXT)>TEXT - - (BODY)>BODY - - (OPENER,  DIVO,  CLOSER)>0PENER - - (TITLE, NUM, DATE, NAME?, SEGI)>SEGI - - (SEGIi, (#PCDATAIRSIDATEINUM)+)>(SEGii, NUM, DATE, RS, NAME, TITLE) (#PCDATA)><!ELEMENT\ [SEGI5)+,<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT<!ELEMENT(DIVO) - - ( (#PCDATA \[RS INUM \[DATE ISEG4\[SEGS ISEG6\[SEG7 ISEG8 ISEGI2 \[SEGi4SEG9?, SEGIO?

.</d iv0> tags of Figure 1 ren-ders three records in the database.
Note howthe content of the string field in the databasemaintains only the initial <segn> and <rs>tags.
Furthermore, <rs> tagged segments in-side <segn> records are simplified so that theircontent is dismissed and only the initial tag iskept (Lange et al, 1997).
The reason is thatthey are considered variable elements withinthe segment (dates and numbers are also thesetype of elements).
The strings Orden Foral ofrecord 2 marked as <rs  type=law> and Salade lo Contencioso-Administrativo del TribunalSuperior de Justicia del Pais Vasco of record3 <rs  type=organ izat ion> are thus not in-cluded in record 1 <segg>,  since they may dif-fer in other instantiations of the segment.
Theseinternal elements are largely proper names thatvary from one instantiation of the segment oanother.
The <rs> tag can be consideredto be the name of the varying element.
Thevalue of the type attribute <rs  type=law>constraints the kind of referential expressionthat may be inserted in that point of the trans-lation segment.
Table 2 shows that sourceand target records may not have straight one-to-one correspondences.
Although this is byno means the general:case; only about 5.61%,(Martinez, 1998a), such one-to-N correspon-dences provide good ground to explain howthe TM2 is designed.
The asymmetry can beeasily explained.
The Spanish term recursocontencioso-administrativo has been translatedinto Basque by means of a category changingoperation, where the Spanish adjective admin-istrativo has been translated as a Basque nouncomplement Administrazioarekiko which liter-ally means "Administration-the-with-of' trig-gering its identification as a proper noun.Table 3 shows the way in which source lan-guage units are related with their correspond-ing target units, which, as can be observed, canbe one-to-one or one-to-N.
This means that onesource element can have more than one transla-tion.TM2 is created in three steps:?
First, non-pertinent ags are filtered outfrom the annotated corpus.
Tags markingsentence <s> and paragraph <p> align-ment are removed because they are of nointerest for TM2 'recall that they are reg-istered in TM1).?
Second, translation segments <segn>,<t i t le> phrases and referential expres-sions <rs> are detected in the source doc-ument and looked up in the database.o Third, if they are not already present inthe database, they are stored each in itsdatabase.and values of the id  and  cor respattributes-are~used to set the correspon-dence between source and target database.4 Compos i t ion  S t ra tegyEvery phase in tile process is guided by themarkup contained in TM2 and the paired DTDs35Spanish Unit<seg9> Contra dicha <rs type=law>,que agota la viaadministrativa podr~i interponerse r cursocontencioso-administrativo ntela <rs type=organization>,en el plazo de dos meses, contadodesde el dla siguientea esta notificacidn, sin perjuiciode la utilizaci6nBasque Unit<seg9> <rs type=law>horrek amaiera eman dio?

The markup and the pairedDTD guides the process in the following man-ner:1.
Before the user starts writing the sourcedocument, he must select a document type,i.e., a DTD.
This has two consequences.
Onthe one hand, the selected DTD producesa source document template that containsthe logical structure of the document andsome of its contents.
On the other hand,the selected source DTD trigger:s .a targetpaired DTD, which will be used later totranslate the document.
There are threedifferent types of elements in the sourcedocument template:?
Some elements are mandatory and are.
:  A .
.provided to the user, who must onlychoose its content among some alter-native usages (s/he will get a list ofalternatives ordered by frequency, forexample <t i t le>) .
Other obligatoryelements, such as dates and numbers,will also be automatically generated.o Some other elements in the templateare optional (e.g., <seg9>).
Again,a list of alternatives will be offered tothe user.
These optional elements are.sensitive to the .context (document ordivision type), and markup is also re-sponsible for constraining the valid op-- ~ tion.s.g:iverlTtQ,the user:.

It is themost variable part, and .the system letsthe writer input text freely.
It is whenTM2 has nothing to offer that TM1and TM3 may provide useful material.Given the recurrent style of legal doc-umentation, it is quite likely that theuser will be using many of the bilin-gual text choices already aligned andavailable in TM1 and TM3.2.
Once the source document has been com-pleted, the system derives its particularlogical structure, which, with the aid of thetarget DTD, is projected into the resultingtarget logical structure.5 Eva luat ionTable 4 shows the number of words that makeup the segments stored in TM2 from the sourcedocuments.
There is a line for each documentsize considered.
We can see that the averageof segments contained in TM2 is 31.8%, on ascale from 34.91% to only 3.01%.
The amountof segments dealt with in this way largely de-pends on the size of the document.
Short doc-uments (90.21) have about 35% of their textcomposed in this way.
This figure goes down to3% in documents larger than 1,000 words.
Thisis understandable, in the sense that the largerthe document, the smaller proportion of fixedsections it will contain.Table 5. shows the Immber of words that areproposed for the target document.
These trans-lations are obtained from what is stored in TM2complemented by algorithms designed to trans-late dates and numbers.
We can see that theaverage of document ranslated is 34%.

scriptive markup can~be"employed to ease theprocess of generating bilingual dedicated ocu-mentation.
On average, one third of the con-tents of thedocuments can be automatically ac-counted for.
It must also be pointed out thatthe part being dealt with represents the corestructure, lay-out and logical components of thetext.
The remaining two-thirds of untreateddocument can still be managed with the aidof sentence-oriented TMBS, filling in the gapsin the ore/all skeleton provided by the targettemplate.
Composers may also browse TM3 toretrieve whole blocks for those parts which arenot determined by the DTD.
One of the cleartargets for the future is to extend the cover-age of the corpus and to test structural taggersagainst other document types.
A big challengewe face is to develop tools that automaticallyperform the recognition of documents from lessrestricted and more open text types.
However,we are not sure of the extent of the practicalityof such an approach.
An alternative directionwe are presently considering is to establish acollection of pre-defined ocument types, whichwould be validated by the institutional writersthemselves.
It is a process currently being im-plemented in the Basque administration to de-fine docmnent models for writers and transla-tors to follow.
What we have demonstrated isthat paired DTDs, complemented with rich lan-guage resources of the kind defined in this pa-per, allow for the design of optimal editing envi-ronments which would combine both documentcomposition and translation as one single pro-cess.
All the resourcesneeded (DTDs.and TMs) .can be induced from an aligned corpus.7 AcknowledgementsThis research is being partially supported by theSpanish Research Agency, project ITEM, TIC-96-1243-C03-01.ReferencesH.
