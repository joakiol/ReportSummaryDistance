IntroductionThis paper describes our current research on the prop-erties of derivational ffixation in English.
Our researcharises from a more general research project, the LexicalSystems project at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Researchlaboratories, the goal for which is to build a variety ofcomputerized dictionary systems for use both by peopleand by computer programs.
An important sub-goal is tobuild reliable and robust word recognition mechanismsfor these dictionaries.
One of the more important issuesin word recognition for all morphologically complexlanguages involves mechanisms for dealing with affixes.Two complementary motivations underlie our researchon derivational morphology.
On the one hand, our goalis to discover linguistically significant generalizationsand principles governing the attachment of affixes toEnglish words to form other words.
If we can find suchgeneralizations, then we can use them to build our ~m-proved word recognizer.
We will be better able to cor-rectly recognize and analyse well-formed words and, onthe other hand, to reject ill-formed words.
On the otherhand, we want to use our existing word-recognition a danalysis programs as tools for gathering further infor-mation about English affixation.
This circular processallows us to test and refine our emerging word recogni-tion logic while at the same time providing a largeamount of data for linguistic analysis.It is important o note that, while doing derivationalmorphology is not the only way to deal with complexwords in a computerized dictionary, it offers certain ad-vantages.
It allows systems to deal with coinages, apossibility which is not open to most systems.
Systemswhich do no morphology and even those which handleprimarily inflectional affixation (such as Winograd(1971) and Koskenniemi (1983)) are limited by thefixed size of their lists of stored words.
Koskenniemiclaims that his two-level morphology framework canhandle derivational ffixation, although is examples areall of inflectional processes.
It is not clear how thatframework accounts for the variety of phenomena thatwe observe in English derivational morphology.Morphological analysis also provides an additionalsource of lexical information about words, since a word'sproperties can often be predicted from its structure.
Inthis respect, our dictionaries are distinguished fromthose of Allen (1976) where complex words are merelyanalysed as concatenations of word-parts and Cercone(1974) where word structure is not exploited, eventhough derivational ffixes are analysed.Our morphological nalysis ystem was conceived withinthe linguistic framework of word-based morphology, asdescribed in Aronoff (1976).
In our dictionaries, westore a large number of words, together with associatedidiosyncratic information.
The retrieval mechanismcontains a grammar of derivational (and inflectional)affixation which is used to analyse input strings in termsof the stored words.
The mechanism handles both pre-fixes and suffixes.
The framework and mechanism aredescribed in Byrd (1983a).
Crucially, in our system, theattachment of an affix to a base word is conditioned onthe properties of the base word.
The purpose of our re-search is to determine the precise nature of those condi-tions.
These conditions may refer to syntactic, semantic,etymological, morphological or phonological properties.
(See Byrd (1983b)).Our research is of interest to two related audiences: bothcomputational linguists and theoretical linguists.
Com-putational linguists will find here a powerful set of pro-120grams for processing natural language material.Furthermore, they should welcome the improvements othose programs' capabilities offered by our linguistic re-suits.
Theoretical linguists, on the other hand, will finda novel set of tools and data sources for morphologicalresearch.
The generalizations that result from our ana-lyses should be welcome additions to linguistic theory.2.
Approach and ToolsOur approach to computer-aided morphological re-search is to analyse a large number of English words interms of a somewhat smaller list of monomorphemicbase words.
For each morphologically complex wordon the original ist which can be analysed own to oneof our bases, we obtain a structure which shows the af-fixes and marks the parts-of-speech of the components.Thus, for beautification, we obtain the structure<<<beauty>N +ify>V +ion>N.In this structure, the noun beauty is the ultimate base and+ify and +ion are the affixes.After analysis, we obtain, for each base, a list of allwords derived from it, together with their morphologicalstructures.
We then study these lists and the patternsof affixation they exemplify, seeking generalizations.Section 3 will give an expanded escription of the ap-proach together with a detailed account of one of thestudies.We have two classes of tools: word lists and computerprograms.
There are basically four word lists.1.
The Kucera and Francis (K&F) word list, fromKucera and Francis (1967), contains 50,000 wordslisted in order of frequency of occurrence.2.
The BASE WORD LIST consists of approximately3,000 monomorphemic words.
It was drawn fromthe top of the K&F list by the GETBASES proce-dure described below.3.
The UDICT word list consists of about 63,000words, drawn mainly from Merriam (1963).
TheUDICT program, described below, uses this list inconjunction with our word grammar to producemorphological analyses of input words.
TheUDICT word list is a superset of the base word list;for each word, it contains the major category as wellas other grammatical information.4.
The "complete" word list consists of approximatelyone quarter million words drawn from aninternational-sized dictionary.
Each entry on thislist is a single orthographic word, with no additionalinformation.
These are the words which aremorphologically analysed own to the bases on ourbase list.5.
We have prepared reverse spelling word lists basedon each of the other lists.
A particularly useful toolhas been a group of reverse lists derived fromMerriam(1963) and separated by major category.These lists provide ready access to sets of wordshaving the same suffix.Our computer programs include the following.1.
UDICT.
This is a general purpose dictionary accesssystem intended for use by computer programs.
(The UDICT program was originally developed forthe EPISTLE text-critiquing system, as described inHeidorn, et al (1982).)
It contains, among otherthings, the morphological analysis logic and theword grammar that we use to produce the wordstructures previously described.2.
GETBASES.
This program produces a list ofmonomorphemic words from the original K&F fre-quency lists.
Basically, it operates by invokingUDICT for each word.
The output consists ofwords which are morphologically simple, and thebases of morphologically complex words.
(Amongother things, this allows us to handle the fact thatthe original K&F lists are not lemmatised.)
The re-sulting list, with duplicates removed, is our "baselist".3.
ANALYSE.
ANALYSE takes each entry from thecomplete word list.
It invokes the UDICT programto give a morphological nalysis for that word.
Anyword whose ultimate base is in the base list is con-sidered a derived word.
For each word from thebase list, the final result is a list of pairs consistingof \[derived-word, structure\] The data produced byANALYSE is further processed by the next fourprograms.4.
ANALYSES.
This program allows us to inspect heset of \[derived-word,structure\] pairs associated withany word in the base list.
For example, its outputfor the word beauty is shown in Figure 1.
In the121beautied <<*>N +ed>Abeautification <<<*>N +ify>V +ion>Nbeautif ier <<<*>N +ify>V #er>Nbeautiful <<*>N #ful>Abeautiful ly <<<*>N #ful>A -ly>Dbeautifulness <<<*>N #ful>A #ness>Nbeautify <<*>N +ify>Vunbeautified <un# <<<*>N +ify>V +ed>A>Aunbeautified <un# <<<*>N +ify>V -ed1>V>Vunbeautiful <un# <<*>N #ful>A>Aunbeautifully <<un# <<*>N #ful>A>A -ly>Dunbeautifulness <<un# <<*>N #ful>A>A #ness>Nunbeautify <un# <<*>N +ify>V>Vrebeautify <re# <<*>N +ify>V>VFigure 1.
ANALYSES Output.structures, an asterisk represents the ultimate basebeauty.5.
SASDS.
This program produces 3 binary matricesindicating which bases take which single affixes toform another word.
One matrix is produced foreach of the major categories: nouns, adjectives, andverbs.
More detail on the contents and use of thesematrices is given in Section 3.6.
MORPH.
This program uses the matrices createdby SASDS to list bases that accept one or moregiven affixes.7.
SAS.
(SAS is a trademark of the SAS Institute, Inc.,Cary, North Carolina.)
This is a set of statisticalanalysis programs which can be used to analyse thematrices produced by SASDS.8.
WordSmith.
This is an on-line dictionary system,developed at IBM, that provides fast and convenientreference to a variety of types of dictionary infor-mation.
The WordSmith functions of most use inour current research are the REVERSE dimension(for listing words that end the same way), theWEBSTER7 application (for checking the defi-nitions of words we don't know), and the UDEDapplication (for checking and revising the contentsof the UDICT word list).3.
Detailed MethodsOur research can be conveniently described as a twostage process.
During the first stage, we endeavored toproduce a list of morphologically active base words fromwhich other English words can be derived by affixation.The term "morphologically active" means that a wordcan potentially serve as the base of a large number ofaffixed derivatives.
Having such words is important forstage two, where patterns of affixation become moreobvious when we have more instances of bases that ex-hibit them.
We conjectured that words which were fre-quent in the language have a higher likelihood ofparticipating in word-formation processes, o we beganour search with the 6,000 most frequent words in theK&F word list.The GETBASES program segregated these words intotwo categories: morphologically simple words (i.e.,those for which UDICT produced a structure containingno affixes) and morphologically complex words.
At thesame time, GETBASES discarded words that were notmorphologically interesting; these included propernouns, words not belonging to the major categories, andnon-lemma forms of irregular words.
(For example, thepast participle done does not take affixes, although itslemma do will accept #able as in doable)GETBASES next considered the ultimate bases of themorphologically complex words.
Any base which didnot also appear in the K&F word list was discarded.
Theremaining bases were added to the original list ofmorphologically simple words.
After removing dupli-cates, we obtained a list of approximately 3,000 veryfrequent bases which we conjectured weremorphologically active.Development of the GETBASES program was an itera-tive process.
The primary type of change made at eachiteration was to correct and improve the UDICT gram-mar and morphological nalysis mechanism.
Becausethe constraints on the output of GETBASES were clear(and because it was obvious when we failed to meetthem), the creation of GETBASES proved to be a veryeffective way to guide improvements to UDICT.
Themore important of these improvements are discussed inSection 4.3.For stage two of our project, we used ANALYSE toprocess the "complete" word list, as described in Section2.
That is, for each word, UDICT was asked to producea morphological nalysis.
Whenever the ultimate basefor one of the (morphologically complex) words ap-peared on our list of 3,000 bases, the derived word andits structure were added to the list of such pairs'associ-ated with that base.
ANALYSE yielded, therefore, a listof 3,000 sublists of \[word,structure\] pairs, with eachsublist named by one of our base words.
We called thisresult BASELIST.122NOUNS #+ + ++++#h+++a+++e+i  i oo  foa a a r c e e r i f z r u u o1 n ryyd  nycyeys  Id###a o##11smnvi ie ihboesssk i in rhmsep###anchorancientangelanimalannualanodeanonymansweranx ietyapartmentapprent ice000001000000000000010000000000000000001010000010000001010000000000000010000100000001010000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000lO00000000000000000000000000010011000001000000000100001100001000000000000000000000000000100011O0OOOO0100000000O0OO1O0OADJECTIVES i U# n o n+++#n tnvps  d+ + i i i i e i e o e r u u ec e f t z s s n r n r e b n rynyye  h s # # ## ## ##fa in tfa i rfa l lfa lsefami l ia rfami lyfancyfastfa tfavor i tefederalfee l ingfe l lfe l lowfemalefes t iva l000001100010010000001100000010000000010010001000000100100010000110110011010000001001100100000000010010010010000000000000010001100110000000000000101010000010100101010000000100000011010000100000000000000000000011000110100000010000000000001010VERBS i U+ # n o n+ a + ++++ #m tmv p s da n a + + i i o u # i e d e e i e r r u u ebc  neeovu ren  nan  r s ree  bn  r1 e tdenesergt###+######study 1001000001000000111001s tu f f  0001000001100000101011s ty le  0000000000000000001100subject  1001011000000000011010submarine 0000000001000000000000submit 0100010001000000011000subst i tu te  1001011001100000011000succeed 1000000001100000001000sue 1000000001100100001000su f fe r  1100000001100000011000sugar 0001000001001000000000suggest 1000011001110000011000su i t  1000000000100000001011Figure 2.
The NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, and VERBS matrices froln SASDS.123Our first in-depth study of this material involved theprocess of adding a single affix to a base word to formanother word.
By applying SASDS to BASELIST, weobtained 3 matrices howing for each base which affixesit did and did not accept.
The noun matrix contained1900 bases; the adjective matrix contained 850 bases;and the verb matrix contained 1600 bases.
(Since theoriginal ist of bases contained words belonging to mul-tiple major categories, these counts add up to more than3,000.
The ANALYSE program used the part-of-speech assignments from UDICT to disambiguate suchhomographs.
)Figure 2 contains amples taken from the noun, adjec-tive, and verb matrices.
For each matrix, the horizontalaxis shows the complete list of affixes (for that part-of-speech) covered in our study.
The vertical axes givecontiguous samples of our ultimate bases.Our results are by no means perfect.
Some of our mis-analyses come about because of missing constraints inour grammar.
The process of correcting these errors isdiscussed in Section 4.
Sometimes there are genuineambiguities, as with the words refuse (<re# <fuse>V>V)and preserve (<pre# <serve>V>V).
In the absence of in-formation about how an input word is pronounced orwhat it means, it is difficult to imagine how our analysercan avoid producing the structures shown.Some of our problems are caused by the fact that thecomplete word list is alternately too large and not largeenough.
It includes the word artal, (plural of rod, aMiddle Eastern unit of weight) which our rules dutifully,if incorrectly, analyse as <<art>N +al >A.
Yet it fail~ toinclude angelhood, even though angel bears the \[+hu-man\] feature that #hood seems to require.Despite such errors, however, most of the analyses inthese matrices are correct and provide a useful basis forour analytical work.
We employed a variety of tech-niques to examine these matrices, and the BASELIST.Our primary approach was to use SAS, MORPH, andANALYSES to suggest hypotheses about affix attach-ment.
We then used MORPH, WordSmith, and UDICT(via changes to the grammar) to test and verify thosehypotheses.
Hypotheses which have so far survived ourtests and our skepticism are given in Section 4.4.
ResultsUsing the mcthods described, we have produced, resultswhich enhance our understanding of morphologicalprocesses, and have produced improvements in themorphological nalysis ystem.
We present here someof what we have already learned.
Continued researchusing our approach and data will yield further esults.4.1 Methodological ResultsIt is significant that we were able to perform this re-search with generally available materials.
With the ex-ception of the K&F word frequency list, our word listswere obtained from commercially available dictionaries.This work forms a natural accompaniment to anotherLexical Systems project, reported in Chodorow, et al(1985), in which semantic information is extracted fromcommercial dictioriaries.
As the morphology projectidentifies lexical information that is relevant, variationsof the semantic extraction methods may be used topopulate the dictionary with that information.As has already been pointed out, our rules leave a resi-due of mis-analysed words, which shows up (for exam-ple) as errors in our matrices.
Although we can nevereliminate this residue, we can reduce its size by intro-ducing additional constraints into our grammar as wediscover them.
For example, chicken was mis-analysedas <<chi c>A +en>V.
As we show in greater detail below,we now know that the +en suffix requires a\[+Germanic\] base; since chic is \[-Germanic\[, we canavoid the mis-analysis.
Similarly we can avoid analysinglegal as <<leg>N +al>A by observing that +al requiresa \[-Germanic\] base while leg is \[+Germanic\].
Finally,we now have several ways to avoid the mis-analysis ofmaize as <<ma>N +ize>V, including the observation that+ize does not accept monosyllabic bases.
We don't ex-pect, however, to find a constraint that will deal cor-rectly with words like artal.In the introduction, we pointed out that one of our goalswas to build a system which can handle coinages.
Withrespect to the 63,000-word UDICT word list, thequarter-million-word complete word list can be viewedas consisting mostly of coinages.
The fact that our ana-lyser has been largely successful at analysing the wordson the complete word list means that we are close tomeeting our goal.
What remains is to exploit our re-search results in order to reduce our mis-analysed resi-due as much as possible.1244.
2 L inguist ic  Resul tsLinguistically significant generalizations that have re-sulted so far can be encoded in the form of conditionsand assertions in our word formation rule grammar (seeByrd (1983a)).
They typically constrain interactionsbetween specific affixes and particular groups of words.The linguistic onstraints fall into at least three catego-ries: (1) syllabic structure of the base word; (2)phonemic nature of the final segment of the base word;and (3) etymology of the base word, both derived andunderived.
Each of these is covered below.
Some ofthese constraints have been informally observed byother researchers, but some have not.Constraints on the Syllabic structure of the base word.
Itis commonly known that the length of a base word canaffect an inflectional process such as comparative for-mation in English.
One can distinguish between shortand long words where \[+short\] indicates two or fewersyllables and \[+long\] indicates two or more syllables.For example, a word such as big which is \[+short\] cantake the affixes -er and -est.
In contrast, words whichare \[-short\] cannot, cf.
possible, *possibler, *possiblest.
(There are additional constraints on comparative for-mation, which we will not go into here.
We give hereonly the simplified version.)
We have found that othersuffixes appear to require the feature \[+short\].
For ex-ample, nouns that take the suffix #ish tend to be\[+short\].
The actual results of our analysis how thatno words of four syllables took #ish and only sevenwords of three syllables took #ish.
In contrast, a totalof 221 one and two syllable words took this suffix.
Thesuffix thus preferred one syllable words over two sylla-ble words by a factor of four (178 one syllable wordsover 43 two syllable words).
Compare boy~boyish withmimeograph/mimeographish.
T is is not to say that aword like mimeographish is necessarily ill-formed, butthat it is less likely to occur, and in fact did not occur ina list like Merriam (1963).Two other suffixes also appear to select for number ofsyllables in the base word.
In this case the denominalverb suffixes +ize and +ify are nearly in complementarydistribution.
Our data show that of the approximately200 bases which take +ize, only seven are monosyllabic.Compare this with the suffix +tfy which selects forabout 100 bases, of which only one is trisyllabic and 17are disyllabic.
Thus, +t.
?v tends to select for \[+short\]bases while +ize tends to select for \[+long\] ones.
Aswith #ish, there appears to be motivation for syllabicstructure constraints on morphological rules.In the case of +ize and +ify it appears that the syllabicstructure of the suffix interacts with the syllabic struc-ture of the base.
Informally, the longer suffix selects fora \[+short\] base, and the shorter suffix selects for a\[+long\] base.
Our speculation is that this may be relatedto the notion of optimal target metrical structure as dis-cussed in Hayes (1984).
This notion, however, is thesubject of future research.The Final Segment of the Base Word.
The phonemic na-ture of the final segment appears to affect the propensityof a base to take an affix.
Consider the fact that thereoccurred some 48 +ary adjectives derived from nounsin our data.
Of these, 46 are formed from bases endingwith alveolars.
The category alveolar includes thephonemes / t / ,  /d / ,  /n / ,  / s / ,  / z / ,  and/1 / .
The twoexceptions are customary and palmary.
Again, in a wordrecognizer, if a base does not end in one of thesephonemes, then it is not likely to be able to serve as thebase of +ary.
We have also found that the ual spellingof the +al suffix prefers a preceding alveolar, such asgradual, sexual, habitual.Another esult related to the alveolar equirement is aneven more stringent requirement of the nominalizingsuffix +ity.
Of the approximately 150 nouns taking+ity, only three end in the phoneme / t /  (chastity,sacrosanctity, and vastity).
In addition the adjectivizer+cy seems also to attach primarily to bases ending in/ t / .
The exceptions are normalcy and supremacy.Etymology of the Base Word.
The feature \[+Germanic\]is said to be of critical importance in the analysis ofEnglish morphology (Chomsky and Halle 1968,Marchand 1969).
In two cases our data show this to betrue.
The suffix +en, which creates verbs from adjec-tives, as in moist~moisten, yielded a total of fifty-fivecorrect analyses.
Of these, forty-three appear inMerriam (1963), and of these forty-one are of Germanicorigin.
The remaining two are quieten and neaten.
Theformer is found only in some dialects.
It is clear that+en verbs aI'e:oyerwhelmingly formed on \[+Germanic\]bases.The feature \[Germanic\] is also significant with +al ad-jectives.
In contrast o the +en stfffix, +al selects forthe feature \[-Germanic\].
In our data, there were some125two hundred and seventy two words analysed as adjec-tives derived from nouns by +al suffixation.
Of thebase words which appear in Merriam (1963), only one,bridal, is of Germanic origin.
However, interestingly, itturns out that the analysis <<bride>N +al >A is spurious,since bridal is the reflex of an Old English formbrydealu, a noun referring to the wedding feast.
Theadjective bridal is not derived from bride.
Rather it waszero-derived historically from the nominal form.Finally, other findings from our analysis how that nowords formed with the Anglo-Saxon prefixes a+, be+or for+ will negate with the Latinate prefixes non# orin#.
This supports the findings of Marchand (1969).Observe that in these examples, the constraint appliesbetween affixes, rather than between an affix and abase.
The addition of an affix thus creates a new com-plex lexical item, complete with additional propertieswhich can constrain further affixation.In sum, our sample findings suggest a number of newconstraints on morphological rules.
In addition we pro-vide evidence and support for the observations of others.4.3 Improvements to the ImplementationIn addition to using our linguistic results to change thegrammar, we have also made a variety of improvementsto UDICT's morphological analyser which interpretsthat grammar.
Some have been for our own conven-ience, such as streamlining the procedures for changingand compiling the grammar.
Two of the improvements,however, result directly from the analysis of our wordlists and files.
These improvements represent gener-alizations over classes of affixes.First, we observed that, with the exception of be, do, andgo, no base spelled with fewer than three characters evertakes an affix.
Adding code to the analyser to restrictthe size of bases has had an important effect in avoidingspurious analyses.A more substantial result is that we have added toUDICT a comprehensive s t of English spelling ruleswhich make the right spelling adjustments o the baseof a suffix virtually all of the time.
These rules, for ex-ample, know when and when not to double final conso-nants, when to retain silent e preceding a suffixbeginning with a vowel, and when to add k to a baseending in c. These rules are a critical aspect Of UDICT'sability to robustly handle normal English input and toavoid misanalyses.5.
Further Analyses and PlansWhen we have modified our grammar to incorporate re-suits we have obtained, and added the necessary sup-porting features and attributes to the words in UDICT'sword list, we will re-run our programs to produce filesbased on the corrected analyses that we will obtain.These files will, in turn, be used for further analysis inthe Lexical Systems project, and by other researchers.We plan to continue our work by looking for more con-straints on affixation.
A reasonable, if ambitious, goalis to achieve a word formation rule grammar which is"tight" enough to allow us to reliably generate wordsusing derivational affixation.
Such a capability wouldbe important, for example, in a translation applicationwhere idiomaticness often requires that a translatedconcept appear with a different part-of-speech t an inthe source language.Further research will investigate patterns of multipleaffixation.
Are there any interdependencies among af-fixes when more than one appear in a given word?
If so,what are they?
One important question in this area hasto do with violations of the Affix Ordering Generaliza-tion (Siegel (1974)), sometimes known as "bracketingparadoxes".A related issue which emerged uring our work concernsprefixes, such as pre# and over#, which apparently ignorethe category of their bases.
It may be that recursive ap-plication of prefixes and suffixes is not the best way toaccount for such prefixes.
We would like to use our datato address this question.Our data can also be used to investigate themorphological behavior of words which are "zero-derived" or "drifted" from a different major category.Such words are the nouns considerable, accused, and be-yond listed in Merriam(1967).
Contrary to our goal forGETBASES (to produce a list of morphologically activebases), these words never served as the base for deriva-tional affixation in our data.
We conjecture that somemechanism in the grammar prevents them from doing so,and plan to investigate the nature of that mechanism.Obtaining results from investigations of this type will notonly be important for producing a robust word analysissystem, it will also significantly contribute to our the-oretical understanding of morphological phenomena.126AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Mary Neff and Martin Chodorow,both members of the Lexical Systems project, for ongo-ing comments on this research.
