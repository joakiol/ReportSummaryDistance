Themethod that we develop is based on the use of bilingualdictionaries, having supposed that lemmatization hastaken place.
We first show that this method performspoorly in terms of silence and noise.
To improve itsperformance we introduce syntactic dependencyrelations between the words in each of the twosentences considered.
In this sense the syntagmaticlevel comes to the rescue of the paradigmatic level atwhich the alignment actually takes place.I.
IntroductionGiven that two sentences F and E are translations ofeach other.
Is there a simple method for aligning thewords in each sentence?
In other words is wordalignment algorithmically simple to implement?
Weshall see that this problem is extremely delicate, evento be done by hand.
To convince oneself, one needmerely attempt it in order to see how quickly thechoices pass from trivial to complicated.
Thedifficulties tem from there not always being a simpleone-to-one correspondence b tween the words of thetwo sentences.
One word may correspond to manywords (an expression); in other cases, one or manywords may correspond to no other words.
On the otherhand, word order is rarely maintained, and to topthings off, different syntactic status create complicatedpairings when they do exist.IL Conventions and restrictions concerningmanual alignment o f  wordsLet's begin by the cases that will be excluded ue to theexcessive l vel of difficulty that they present.Consider the two sentences ~ ?E17 : BUtl the2 similarities3 are4 illus?rYS" 6F18 : Ces l c?mparais?ns2 ?nt 3 leurs4 limites 5 : 61.
All the pairs of sentences a examples are extracted fromThe Acoustics of the Harpsichord (SCIENTIFICAMER/CAN, February 1991) and its French translationL'acoustique du clavecin (POLrR LA SCIENCE, avril 1991)Although these sentences correspond to each other inthe text that they appeared in, we cannot establish analignment of their words.
We will not study these casesfor a few reasons: first, outside of their context it isdifficult, even for human readers, to affirm theirsemantic relation as a translation; secondly, in order toalign these sentences, the entire sentences must beconsidered as an expression, and this is debatable.How can manual alignments be represented?We will distinguish t e alignment of words and groupsof words whose mutual translation is established withthe aid of a bilingual dictionary from alignments hatare made from a local recomposition based on human"comprehension" of the two sentences.We will use the equal-sign (=) to mark links whichcome from a bilingual dictionary and the star symbol(*) to mark comprehension correspondences.
We willcall the first type of correspondence "lexicalcorrespondence" and the second type "contextualcorrespondence".The alignments (l-n) (m-l) or (m-n) are characterizedby the presence, on the same line, of more than one *or =.
Let's give an example:F93 : Unel partiee seulement3 de~ cesj vibrations6contribuez aus son9 ~misw parn le~2 clavecin~ ,~4maistz tousle les~z mouvementsls d~terminentt9 le2o ~?

HypothesisAs a basis of our algorithm we find the followinghypothesis.
Consider two sentences F and E which aretranslations of each other.We say that two words j~ and ej, belonging to F and Erespectively, correspond to each other if: i) they aretranslations of each other; ii) they enter into the samedependency relations with their neighbors; iii) theyoccupy the same positions.IV.
Potential AlignmentsConsider the two sentences F and E. The potentialalignment of words is obtained by comparing each ofthe words of one sentence with all of those from thesecond sentence.
The comparisons ~, ej) areestablished with the help of a simple word transferdictionary and the results are stored in a m x n matrix(m being the number of words in the French sentenceand n in the English).
Each element receives a notethat is higher if the two words are: i) translations inthe dictionary, ii) long, iii) in the same position.V.
Ambiguity, noise and silenceAn alignment is 'ambiguous' if more than one solutionis produced.
Typology of errors (noise, silence): Wewill call errors of noise those alignments createdbetween words should not be aligned, and errors ofsilence missing alignments between words which weremanually aligned.VI.
The reasons for noise and silenceNoise: At the root of noisy alignments we find theproblem ofpolysemy.
When it is not resolved, it causeswords to be aligned through sense that are improper inthe current context.Another source of error corresponds tosimple errors ofalignment: he two words are translations of each otherbut in the present context hey should not be aligned.For example, in the following sentences areas28 wasincorrectly aligned with zones17.E91 : When I the 2 soundboard 3 vibrates 4 at 5 one 6 of 7its8 resonant9 frequencieslo ,11 thel2 glitter13bouncesl4 out15 of 16 regions17 thatl8 are19moving20 and21 collects22 along23 nodal24 lines25,26 ?r27 areas28 where29 the30 s?undb?ard31 is32 "'"F69 : Lorsque I la 2 table d'harmonie 3 vibre 4 a5 l'une6de7 ses8 fr~quences9 delo res?nance11 ,12 lesl3paillettesl4 quittentl5 les16 zones17 enl8mouvement19 ...Silence: The main problem is something missing fromthe dictionary: either the head word is not present, orthe correct ranslation is absent.
This is essentially thenon-recognition fsynonymy that is the problem.VII.
Resolution by Analogic ReasoningIn order to reduce both noise and silence, we use amechanism based on analogical reasoning.
This isbased on the following fundamental hypothesis:paradigmatic relations can help determinesyntagmatic relations and vice-versa.Using monolingual dependency relations.The resolution mechanism can be understood from thefollowing diagram.S1French ~.. .

.I - -ep R, eqAnalogic RectangleOn this figure are represented four words of which twoare aligned (~, ep).
Syntactic dependencies betweentwo other pairs of words ~ j~\] and \[ep eq\] are alsorepresented.
We want to know how valid thealignment betweenJ~ and e e is.To answer this, we reason in the following way:1.
On the syntagmatic plane,\[\] sincej~ is in relation withj~ (the relation R/being supposed valid),\[\] since e e is in relation with eq (the relationR, being valid),2. on the paradigmatic plane,\[\] since ~ is the translation of eq (supposingthe alignment relation P2 is valid),then we conclude, by analogy, that the alignmentrelation Pl is also valid, in other words that j~ and e eare translations of each other in this context.
Thisdegree of validity will be stronger as the dependencyrelations Rf and 1% are close (identical or compatible)and as P1 and P2 get close to identity.We will call strong resolution one that confirms anexisting potential alignment, and weak resolution onethat negates an existing alignment or that creates anew alignment.VIII.
ConclusionThe algorithm presented here subdivides into threephases.
The first phase is construction: based onlexical proximity, we try to establish all the possiblelinks between the words of the two sentences beingaligned.
The second phase is one of elimination: usingsyntactic dependencies we attempt to resolveambiguous attachments and to undo nonambiguous buterroneous attachments.
The third step is again one ofconstruction: we attempt to reduce silence.We repeat that even human solutions to alignments aresubject o wide variations, which shows the difficultyof problem.Ackowledgements to tiadhemi Achour, Chiraz BenOthman, Emna Souissi and Gregory Grefenstette.189
