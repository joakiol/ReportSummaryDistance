:Multilingual Extraction and Structure Analysisof Nominal Compositions using Linguistic RestrictorsPatrick Ziering Lonneke van der PlasInstitute for Natural Language ProcessingUniversity of Stuttgart, Germany{Patrick.Ziering, Lonneke.vanderPlas}@ims.uni-stuttgart.deAbstractFinding a definition of compoundhood that is cross-lingually valid is a non-trivial task as shownby linguistic literature.
We present an iterative method for defining and extracting English nouncompounds in a multilingual setting.
We show how linguistic criteria can be used to extractcompounds automatically and vice versa how the results of this extraction can shed new lightson linguistic theories about compounding.
The extracted compound nouns and their multilingualcontexts are a rich source that serves several purposes.
In an additional case study we show howthe database serves to predict the internal structure of tripartite noun compounds using spellingvariations across languages, which leads to a precision of over 91%.1 IntroductionCompounding is a phenomenon that is studied extensively in linguistic literature.
Also in computationallinguistics, compounds are enjoying more and more attention (?O S?eaghdha, 2008; Hendrickx et al.,2013).
Compounding is a very productive word formation.
Already 2-year-olds are able to form newwords by using compounds consisting of two morphemes (Clark, 1981).
As a consequence, compoundsare a very common word type but many occur with a very low token count.
In an analysis of the GermanAPA corpus, Baroni et al.
(2002) found that almost half (47%) of the word types were compounds.
Atthe same time, the compounds accounted for a small portion of the overall token count (7%), whichsuggests that many of them are rare (83% of the compounds had a corpus frequency of 5 or lower).
ForEnglish, more than half of the two-noun compounds (e.g., car park) in the BNC occur exactly once (Kimand Baldwin, 2006).
The high productivity of compounds makes compositional approaches to automaticprocessing indispensable: listing all possible compounds in a dictionary would be as infeasible as listingall possible adjective-noun combinations.
Even for compound nouns that occur 10 times or more in theBNC, static English dictionaries provide only 27% coverage (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).Being abundant as a phenomenon but scarce in terms of individual examples (the combination ofhigh type frequency and low token frequency) makes the analysis of these compound nouns particularlyproblematic for statistical techniques that need high token frequencies to make accurate predictions.
Datasparsity is expected to lead to low performance.
However, the correct analysis of compound nouns isimportant for a number of NLP tasks, for example in machine translation (Bouillon et al., 1992; Rackowet al., 1992; Johnston and Busa, 1999; Navigli et al., 2003).
The accurate translation of compounds isnon-trivial, because we find a large amount of variation in the way languages deal with compounding.Some languages such as German use closed compounding (i.e., they create one-word compounds, e.g.,Todesstrafe (death penalty)) whereas others do not.
In Romance languages, such as French, compoundsare not as productive, instead postmodifying prepositional phrases (e.g., peine de mort) and adjectives(peine capitale) are used to construct complex nominals.Another challenge in compound translation is due to the fact that the amount of underspecification incompound surface structure varies between languages.
For example, whereas English leaves the com-pound relation (i.e., the semantic relation between two components, e.g., N2made of N1as in iron door)This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Chocolate cake, cake made of chocolate, is translated with gateau au chocolat, whereas weddingcake, cake made for a wedding, is gateau de marriage.The first aim of this study is to extract a large database of compounds and their translations in contextfrom a parallel corpus.
This database will serve multiple purposes.
For example, it will be used to studycompounding across different languages, and we will exploit the cross-lingual variation for compoundprocessing.
In the second part of this paper, we will show a case study of how the extracted databasecan be used for analysing the structure of noun phrases, more specifically, we exploit spelling variationsacross languages for bracketing three-noun compounds (3NCs) such as air traffic control, which could beindicated as LEFT bracketing using the German phrase Kontrolle des Luftverkehrs (control of air traffic).Compounding is an important subject of study in theoretical linguistics, because it constitutes a con-tinuum from fully compositional to idiosyncratic word formation and is found at the boundary betweenwords and phrases.
However, there is virtually no reliable and universally accepted criterion for distin-guishing compounds from phrases or other types of word formations, as stated by Lieber and Stekauer(2009).
They discuss reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds, that we willreview in the next section.
They do, however, also describe a number of linguistic tests, each with theirown advantages and drawbacks.This brings us to the second aim of this paper.
We propose an iterative method that, in absence of aclear definition, validates several linguistic tests on corpus data and continuously refines the definition.We show how we use linguistic tests to extract compounds automatically and vice versa how the resultsof this extraction can shed new lights on linguistic theory about compoundhood.
The multilingual natureof our data (we work on parallel corpora) has the additional advantage that a cross-lingual definition canbe sought by studying compounds in context and their translation across several languages.In Section 2, we discuss the problem of defining noun compounds (NCs) as described by Lieber andStekauer (2009) and present an iterative method for defining and extracting English NCs starting withan initial definition based on some linguistic tests.
In Section 3, we present our method for extractingEnglish NCs and their translations to several languages from a parallel corpus using a set of extractionrules.
An experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4.
In Section 5 we show in a casestudy of bracketing three-noun compounds how our database serves for exploiting multilingual spellingvariations.
Section 6 describes related work and finally Section 7 concludes.2 Iterative method for the definition and extraction of noun compoundsIn this section, we outline the controversy of defining compoundhood as described in linguistic literature.We present several linguistic tests for distinguishing compounds and show how we implement somelinguistic criteria that can be used for identification and extraction of noun compounds and how theseconstitute the initial definition.2.1 Definition of compounds and linguistic criteriaWhen we seek to find a working definition of noun compounds (NCs), we have to keep in mind that notonly the definition but also the existence of such an NC is controversial.
Lieber and Stekauer (2009)present a discussion about this controversy sketched below.
While Bauer (2003) defines a compound asa ?formation of a new lexeme by adjoining two or more lexemes?, Marchand (1967) argues that thereis no compounding word formation at all.
Instead, he uses the word formation EXPANSION, whichcombines prefixed words like reheat with such as steamboat using the criterion of a free head.
Lieberand Stekauer (2009) highlight two reasons for the complexity that arises when defining noun compounds.Firstly, in some languages, constituents are not free but stems or roots.
For example, the Slovak termr?ychlovlak (express train) starts with the stem of the adjective r?ychly (as in the phrase r?ychly vlak (fasttrain)).
The lack of inflection in English makes compositional and phrasal structures (i.e., fast train asphrase or as compound (express train)) collapse.
Secondly, sometimes phrases and derivations cannot bedistinguished from compounds.
While blackboard (in opposition to a black board) can be classified ascompound without dissent, a tomato bowl that just happens to hold tomatoes might not be regarded as a1048single lexeme (conforming Bauer?s (2003) definition).So, the only way for getting a suitable definition is to find solid criterions.
Although Lieber andStekauer (2009) come to the conclusion that there is almost no reliable and universally accepted criterion,they mention several plausible tests.
Compounds can be identified by prosody.
While in the phrase blackbird, the head (bird) is stressed, in the compound blackbird the stress is on the first syllable (black).A syntactic test mentioned by Lieber and Stekauer (2009) is inseparability, i.e., there must not be anyelement intervening a compound?s components.
While black bird can be understood as compound, blackugly bird is a phrase.
Another promising syntactic criterion is the inability to modify the first element(i.e., the modifier) of a compound.
In a phrase like social person, the first element (social) can bemodified (i.e., very social person).
This is not possible for compounds (e.g., very social policy).
A lastsyntactic criterion, the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform suchas one (e.g., black bird vs. black one), would need human support.
A morphological criterion states thatin compounds only the head is inflected.
Although this assumption does not always hold (as shown inexamples like overseas investor or girls club), this seems to be a promising criterion when investigatinginflectional behaviour in aligned languages that show strong morphology, e.g., French.
Conversely,determining compoundhood on the basis of spelling is discarded by Lieber and Stekauer (2009).
Englishorthography is highly inconsistent: some compounds usually occur as a closed compound (e.g., football),some occur hyphenated and some occur as an open compound (e.g., waiting room or rule of law).
Forsome compounds, several spellings are possible (e.g., flowerpot, flower-pot, flower pot or pot of flowers).In our study, we focus on written language as given in a parallel corpus.
Since we do not have anyspeech data, we cannot use any phonological features such as stress for the extraction of noun com-pounds.
For the inability to replace the second noun of a nominal compound with a proform, we cannotassess if the meaning of a sentence would have changed (e.g., We see blackbirds vs. We see black ones).In this paper, we focus on criteria that are most suitable with the current data.
Although Lieber andStekauer (2009) exclude spelling as a reliable criterion of compoundhood, we take it as starting point.The parallel corpus we use for the extraction includes several languages.
Spelling variations betweenlanguages can be exploited to find compounds (e.g., social policy can be written as one word in German(Sozialpolitik)).
We account for the English spelling variations by defining part-of-speech (PoS) patternsthat cover most plausible spellings.
These PoS patterns treat each noun or adjective as a compound?scomponent and thus, this way of extraction inherently implements the criterion of inseparability.
Weexploit multilingual evidence in terms of cross-lingual differences in spelling to extract compounds.Diverse language families have different declinations of forming a closed compound.
While languageslike Danish and German prefer closed compounding, English and Romance languages like Spanish useopen compounds.
It is this spelling variation that we base our first set of extraction rules on with the aimof having a set of English NCs and their translations in up to 9 European languages.
We will show thatcross-lingual closed compounding is a promising feature for extracting English NCs.The inability to modify the first element of a compound seems to be a promising test.
Since thereare many linguistic factors that have to be taken into account (e.g., morphological agreement in gender,number or case), we plan to include this criterion for several languages and any combination of contextualmodifier and potential noun compound.
We will implement this and further morphological criteria infuture work.2.2 Initial definition for compound extractionWith a focus on multilingual validity, we adapt the definition of Bauer (2003) to our multilingual setting.Inspired by Behagel?s (1909) First Law (?Elements that belong close together intellectually will also beplaced close together?
), we associate a closed compounding language realising an English word sequenceas a closed NC with an indicator for compoundhood:Initial definition: A noun compound is a nominal composition of several lexemes that are representedas a one-word expression in some of the languages studied.This definition covers both target single words (e.g., blackbird translates to German as Amsel) or target1049closed compounds (e.g., football match translates to Dutch as voetbalwedstrijd).We are aware of the fact that this definition leads to some controversial cases for English word se-quences including pre-nominal adjectives.
While some of them are commonly accepted such as socialpolicy (German: Sozialpolitik), others are less accepted such as strong wind (German: Starkwind) orsmall car (German: Kleinwagen).
This is not an unwanted side-effect.
On the contrary, these contro-versial cases are an essential part of the iterative process we described, as they will foster linguisticdiscussions.
Although the German Starkwind can be regarded as partly compositional, it is frequentlyused with a concrete definition (in contrast to the phrase starker Wind) and cannot occur in a contextviolating this definition, as shown in the table below.1 a) Als Starkwind wird meist eine Windst?arke zwischen 6 und 7 Beaufort bezeichnet.1 b) A {strong wind} usually refers to a wind force of 6-7 Beaufort.2 a) Am Samstag weht ein starker Wind mit Windst?arke 8 von Westen.2 b) On Saturday, a strong wind with wind force 8 will blow from the west.3 a) *Am Samstag weht ein Starkwind mit Windst?arke 8 von Westen.3 b) On Saturday, a *{strong wind} with wind force 8 will blow from the west.3 Multilingual extraction of NCsThis method is based on the initial definition for compound extraction described in Section 2.2 and can beadapted in succeeding iterations.
English NCs are extracted from a parallel corpus that includes Englishand some closed compounding languages (e.g., German).3.1 Preprocessing the parallel dataIn Section 4.1, we describe the tokenization, sentence alignment, word alignment and PoS tagging weapply to the parallel data in more detail.
In addition, we perform a binary compound splitter on eachword that is tagged as a noun by following a variant of the methods of Stymne et al., (2013).
This un-supervised splitter checks each noun for all possible segmentations into at most two components with atleast two characters.
All possible segmentations are scored with the geometric mean of the components?frequencies in the parallel corpus.
The highest-scored segmentation (possibly with no split point) is used.3.2 Preselection of English noun compounds using PoS patternsAs a basis for the extraction of English NCs, we use a set of possible English PoS sequences that canconstitute an NC.
These PoS patterns account for the various ways of composing English NCs and for theinseparability property as described in Section 2.1.
Table 1 lists all plausible PoS patterns for bipartite andtripartite NCs with some examples (cf.
the Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus et al., 1993)).
For all examplesin Table 1, we found translations to a closed compound in German, which satisfies our initial definitiondescribed in Section 2.2, e.g., overall recovery rate has been translated to Gesamtr?uckforderungsquote.Although the larger the number of components, the sparser the number of (correct) extractions, we createa regular expression for PoS patterns that cover English NCs with n components (where 2 ?
n ?
10).This regular expression combines all possible combinations of observed NC types.
In the next step, wewill filter noise, that occurs mostly in longer word sequences.3.3 Noise filtersThe selection of English NCs and their translations is based on automatic preprocessing, which leads tosome noise due to false PoS tags or flaws in word alignment.
With increasing word sequence length, theamount of noise increases.
We apply several filters on each preselected NC and on their alignments toall other languages in the corpus and keep only those that pass all filters.3.3.1 PoS filters1.
Two filters are applied to all languages: we disqualify word sequences including nouns or adjectivesthat (1) consist of only one character or (2) are contained in a stop list1.1ranks.nl/stopwords1050PoS pattern ExampleBipartite noun compoundsNN marketplaceNN NN death penaltyJJ NN structural policyNN POS NN children?s developmentNN IN NN fall in populationNN IN DT NN concussion of the brainTripartite noun compoundsNN NN NN energy security goalJJ NN NN overall recovery rateNN IN NN IN NN income per head of populationRegular expression for 2?10 componentsNN ((IN (DT)?|POS))?
NN){1,9} greenhouse gas emission allowance trading schemeJJ NN ((IN (DT)?|POS))?
(JJ)?
NN){1,8} internal energy market packageTable 1: English PoS sequences for noun compounds2.
Then, to account for PoS tagging errors in English, we collect all words and their PoS tags in theparallel corpus.
For each word, we compute the probability of being tagged as a noun or adjectiveas given in (1).P (noun/adj | word) =f((noun ?
adj) ?
word)f(word)(1)We disqualify English word sequences, if they contain a noun or adjective w withP (noun/adj | w) < ?.
After testing several values for ?, we have decided to choose ?
= 0.15because it has turned out to be a promising trade-off between coverage and precision (e.g., accept-ing words like human but rejecting words like anywhere).3.3.2 Word alignment filterShortcomings in word alignment quality are remedied with three word alignment filters.1.
We truncate extraneous words (i.e., determiners, prepositions and (ad)verbs) from the border of theword sequence (adjectives are removed from the right border for Germanic languages and from theleft border for Romance languages).2.
We disqualify the word sequence as being phrasal if it contains two consecutive nouns with verbs oradjectives in between or if the nouns are more than ?
tokens apart from each other.
When analysingmany instances of Romance phrases aligned to an English noun compound, we observed that ?
= 3is the maximum token distance two nominal components can be apart (usually separated by prepo-sition or preposition+determiner).
If the word sequence is qualified as phrasal, we add determinersand prepositions that occur in the context between the nouns, otherwise the word sequence remainsunchanged.3.
We remove the word sequence if it does not contain at least one noun.The resulting set of English word sequences that conform to the regular expression in Table 1 and theiraligned and filtered word sequences are stored as a set of m-tuples of word sequences.
Subsequently,we will refer to this set as the basic set.
The basic set still contains English word sequences that do notcomply with our initial definition for compound extraction (Section 2.2), i.e., that are not aligned to aclosed compound.
In the next step, we apply a restrictor to all NCs in the basic set and keep only thoseinstances that pass the restrictor.10513.4 Closed compound restrictorAn English word sequence is considered to be an NC if it is represented as a one-word expression in someof the closed compounding languages (e.g., Dutch, German, Swedish, .
.
.
).
Given a parallel corpus withn > 1 closed compounding languages, this definition leaves space for investigating the degree of cross-lingual closed compounding (degclosed) which is necessary for optimal extraction quality (i.e., optimalprecision and recall).
Because the rules described in Section 3.3.2 still leave some word alignment errors(i.e., English word sequences that are aligned to only a part of the true translation), a single compoundinglanguage realising the English word sequence as one word (i.e., degclosed= 1) might not be restrictiveenough.The closed compound restrictor with degclosed?
i retains only English word sequences that arealigned to at least i one-word expressions in the aligned closed compounding languages.
We will referto this restrictor as CCR(i) and to the resulting data set as closed compound(i).4 Experiments for NC Extraction4.1 SetupData and preprocessing.
We use the 7th release of the Europarl corpus2.
Although the Europarl corpuscomprises 21 European languages, the amount of common data they cover is rather small.
This means,the more languages we use, the smaller the amount of common data.
In order to get a good trade-offbetween cross-lingual coverage and language variation exploitation, we decided on a set of 10 languages:English, the closed compounding languages Danish, Dutch, German and Swedish, as well as Greek andthe Romance languages French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
Instead of preprocessing the parallelcorpus on our own, we exploit the already preprocessed Europarl resource of OPUS3(Tiedemann, 2012).This preprocessed resource is PoS tagged using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) for English, Dutch, German,French, Italian and Spanish and the Hunpos4tagger for Danish, Portuguese and Swedish.
We additionallytagged the Greek data using the MATE5tagger.
The sentence alignment provided by OPUS is restrictedto language pairs.
As we need a sentence representation that is parallel in all 10 languages, we applythe OPUS sentence aligner (with English as pivot) on our language set and extract a total of 884,164parallel sentence representations.
The word alignment information provided by OPUS was also based onlanguage pairs.
This means, the sentence-wise token indices has to be adapted to our updated sentencerepresentation (which is different due to a larger language set).
In OPUS, the word alignment tool GIZA++(Och and Ney, 2003) has been used with the symmetrisation heuristics (grow-diag-final-and (Koehn etal., 2007)).4.2 Evaluation procedure and scoringIn order to compare the added value in terms of recall and precision of each closed compound restrictor(i.e., CCR(1) to CCR(4)), we randomly select 50 accepted and 50 rejected English word sequences foreach restrictor.
We rate the correctness of acceptance and rejection and compute precision and recall asgiven in (2) and (3).
F-Score is defined as harmonic mean of precision and recall.Precision =accepted ?
correctaccepted(2)Recall =accepted ?
correct(accepted ?

(rejected ?

Since the alignment to single words isstill somewhat noisy (i.e., our compound splitter does not work error-free and there are still deficienciesin the word alignment), we select a set of 50 closed noun compound samples and rate the accuracy.
Thefinal amount of closed NCs is the product of relative frequency and accuracy, as given in (4).pccl(Set) =fSet(closed NC)NSet,cll?

The first result is that using only a PoS-based method leads to a very poor extractionaccuracy (38%).
For the applications of the closed compound restrictors, the result is that increasingdegclosedmeans increasing precision but decreasing recall in NC extraction.
The reason for this is that analigned closed NC is generally a sufficient condition for an English NC (except for controversial casessuch as strong wind) but not a necessary condition (i.e., a true English NC may be aligned to only pe-riphrastic constructions).
The highest F-Score (82.1%) is achieved using CCR(2).
We can conclude thatthe closed compound restrictor is a reliable method for extracting English NCs.
In future work, we willuse a large set of human annotators with different backgrounds in order to get a widely distributed senseof compoundhood.
Moreover, instead of a binary rating, we will consider compoundhood as a continuumand compare rating scores with the amount of aligned closed compounding languages realising a closedcompound in a larger parallel corpus.The last column in Table 2 shows the amount of closed English NCs in each respective set.
Sincedegclosedcorrelates with the amount of closed English NCs, we can conclude that, despite the cross-lingual differences in spelling conventions attested in linguistic literature, there is a bias for a universalconsensus in closed compounding.Language pcclGerman 71.2%Danish 63.3%Swedish 62.2%Dutch 58.7%Table 3: The amounts of closed noun compoundsTable 3 shows the amounts of closed noun compounds in the closed compounding languages Danish,Dutch, German and Swedish, extracted from the closed compound (1) set.
Our result shows that Germanis the most productive language in closed compounding (71.2%), while the other languages have a similarproductivity (58-63%).The result of our extraction method is a database of English NCs and their translations in up to 9European languages.
As described in the introduction, this database will serve several purposes.
One is tostudy cross-lingual variation.
Table 4 shows some examples of multilingual noun compound extractionsfrom closed compound (2).1053English German Dutch French Italianautomotive sector Automobilmarkt automobielsector secteur automobile mercato dell?
automobilefishing techniques Fischfangtechniken visserijmethoden techniques de p?eche tecniche di pescatimetable Zeitplan tijdschema calendrier calendariohighways Autobahnen snelwegen autoroutes autostradetrading system Handelssystem handelsbestel syst`eme commercial sistema di scambiTable 4: Examples of multilingual noun compoundsThe examples show that English noun compounds have various realisations in European languages.Although French and Italian are open compounding languages, we do find closed compounding (e.g.,autoroutes).
Compounds such as timetable can also be aligned to single nouns such as calendrier (cal-endar).
We found three common word formation types in Romance languages for bipartite noun com-pounds: (1) two nouns and a preposition in between, (2) one noun and a post-nominal adjective and (3)a single (possibly compounding) noun.
Although Romance languages usually agree with respect to theword formation type, they may disagree as is the case for French and Italian for the example concern-ing trading system.
One interesting observation is that while the head of highways (ways) is translatedfairly literally, the modifier (high) is replaced by alternative aspects.
On highways, cars (Autobahnen(car-ways)) usually drive fast (snelwegen (fast-ways)).
In future work, we will use this database for re-searching the nature of compoundhood in a cross-lingual perspective.
The resource is publicly availablefor future research6.5 Bracketing three-noun compoundsIn this section, we show a case study of how our extracted database can be used to predict the structureof NPs, more specifically to bracket tripartite noun compounds (3NCs), i.e., a composition of three barenouns that function as one unit.
Given a 3NC, we can either have RIGHT bracketing, as in baby [bicycleseat], or LEFT bracketing, as in [human rights] abuses.5.1 The cross-lingual bracketing methodWe first start with six phrase patterns that correspond to foreign phrases that are aligned to an English3NC, as shown in Table 5, where SN refers to a single (non-compounding) noun, FC refers to a func-tional context (i.e., a sequence of functional words), ADJ refers to an adjective and CNC refers to aclosed (bipartite) NC (based on the splitter described in Section 3.1).
Each phrase pattern contains acomplex unit that is separated from the rest, e.g., a closed NC or a combination of adjective and singlenoun.
For each pattern, we know what is the head and what is the modifier: the first phrase patterncontains only one nominal component, that can be identified as head.
For the other patterns, the orderis: head, FC, modifier.
Based on the assumption that the aligned head corresponds to the English head,we can infer the English bracketing from the complexity of the aligned head.
If the aligned head is thecomplex unit, the English bracketing label is RIGHT, otherwise LEFT.
The third column in Table 5 showsthe inferred labels for the English 3NC based on the foreign phrase pattern.
For an English 3NC, wecheck all aligned languages for a matching phrase pattern and collect, in the case of a match, the inferredlabel.
The majority label determines the final bracketing label.The examples below illustrate instances for each phrase pattern, where the indices correspond to thosein Table 5.6www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de1054Phrase pattern in foreign language Label for English 3NC(1) ADJ CNC RIGHT(2) CNC FC SN RIGHT(3) SN FC CNC LEFT(4) SN FC ADJ SN LEFT(5) ADJ SN FC SN RIGHT(6) SN ADJ FC SN RIGHTTable 5: Phrase pattern and inferred label(1) de: staatlichestateSteueraufsichtsbeh?orden{tax inspectorates}?state tax inspectorates?

Sometimes the English head and modifier are swapped in aligned languages, asillustrated in example (7).
(7) nl: stabielestablewisselkoersen{exchange rate}?exchange rate stability?To solve this problem, we inspect the word alignment from the phrase pattern of language ljto theEnglish nouns N1, N2and N3in a 3NC.
If the complex unit is aligned to {N2, N3} or to {N1, N3}, ljprovides the label RIGHT.
If the complex unit is aligned to {N1, N2}, ljvotes for LEFT.
If the complexunit is aligned to all three nouns, this is an indicator for a word alignment error.
In this case, ljwill notperform any prediction.
In all other cases, the inferred label from the phrase pattern is used.5.2 Evaluation for cross-lingual bracketingAs there are only two possible structures for 3NCs, namely LEFT or RIGHT branching, we regard thistask as a binary classification and score the accuracy of class agreement.
As basis, we use the basic setcreated in Section 3, because alignments to closed compounds are not of interest for the bracketing task.Two trained human annotators (of which one is one of the authors) individually bracket a sample of 100randomly selected 3NCs in context.
Contextual cues can help the annotator to disambiguate the structureof the English NC, so the accompanying sentences are shown to the annotator.
The annotators are nodomain experts and since terms in Europarl can be quite domain specific, they are allowed to look up themeaning of the constituents in a dictionary or check Google.
Annotators are asked to label 3NCs as LEFTor RIGHT, or UNDECIDED if they are unclear.
Furthermore, the annotators are asked to mark extractionerrors.
When inspecting the inter-annotator agreement for the bracketing classes (LEFT/RIGHT; i.e., 76of 100 samples), we achieved an agreement rate of 89% and ?
= 0.693 (Cohen, 1960), which meanssubstantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).
Afterwards, the annotators discuss disagreements andrevise their annotations.
This has led to a perfect agreement in our setting.
The 8 UNDECIDED labellingsshow that in some cases the bracketing remains ambiguous even in context.
In future work, we would liketo investigate if larger contexts or domain knowledge is necessary for the disambiguation process or ifthe NCs are inherently flat (i.e., if LEFT or RIGHT bracketing does not make any difference in meaning).We evaluate our cross-lingual bracketing system for (1) inferred label of a phrase pattern and (2) word1055alignment information for phrase pattern with inferred label as back-off.
We compare the bracketingperformance against the LEFT class baseline.5.3 ResultsMethod AccuracyLEFT baseline 71.1 %Inferred phrase pattern labels 89.0?%Word alignment for phrase patterns 91.6?%Table 6: Bracketing performance; ?

The first result is that bothinferred label and word alignment information for phrase pattern outperform the LEFT class baselinesignificantly7.
Bracketing with word alignment information for phrase pattern outperforms bracketingbased on the inferred labels.6 Related WorkOur methods for extracting and structuring English NCs rely on the spelling of various aligned languages.Previous work on multilingual extraction include Morin and Daille (2010) and Weller and Heid (2012).These type-based approaches focus on bilingual terminology extraction using comparable corpora.
Ourtoken-based extraction method includes 10 languages and we extract both the NCs and their context.While the aforementioned work serves as resource for improving machine translation (MT) systems, wefocus on NC research and how multilingual evidence can help analysing and interpreting English NCs.This multilingual perspective on a considerable number of languages has been adopted as well byMacherey et al., (2011), who present a multilingual language-independent approach to compound split-ting.
Moreover, they learned morphological operations on compounding automatically.
Here, Machereyet al., (2011) extract training instances using a method related to Garera and Yarowsky (2008): select asingle word f in a language l translated to several English words ei.
If there is a translation for each eito a word githat shows a (partial) substring match with f , (f ; e1, .
.
.
, en; g1, .
.
.
, gn) is extracted.
WhileMacherey et al., (2011) extract training instances type-based in a bilingual setting, we directly extractNC instances with a set of four closed compounding languages.
This token-based perspective has theadvantage that we can process English NCs for which there is no literal translation to the target language(e.g., health insurance aligned to Krankenversicherung (lit.
invalid insurance)).In cross-lingual annotation transfer (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Pad?o, 2007; Van der Plas et al., 2011)human annotations are transferred from one language to the other in parallel data.
In this paper, we usethe structural differences between languages as found in parallel corpora to generate annotations on thetarget language and do not rely on annotations on the source language.Bracketing methods for both three-noun compounds and complete base NPs have been designed bothsupervised and unsupervised.
Vadas and Curran (2007) used a supervised bracketing method on man-ually annotated data.
Pitler et al.
(2010) used the data from Vadas and Curran (2007) for a parserapplicable on base NPs of any length including coordinations.
Their supervised classifier exploited web-scale N-grams.
Although supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods by far, the need forannotated data is a drawback of supervised approaches.
Bergsma et al.
(2011) used crosslingual data asadditional supervision to make the need for manual annotations less pressing.
Unsupervised methods useN-gram statistics (Marcus, 1980; Lauer, 1995; Nakov and Hearst, 2005) or semantic information (Kimand Baldwin, 2013).7 ConclusionIn this paper, we discussed the complexity related to the definition of compoundhood and presentedan iterative method that tries to refine existing definitions by tentatively demonstrating the efficacy of7Approximate randomization test (Yeh, 2000), p < 5%1056linguistic criteria on corpus data.
The initial implementation of two linguistic criteria, based on cross-lingual spelling conventions and the inseparability of a compound?s components, achieved an F-Score of82.1% on the task of extracting English compounds.The extracted multilingual database of compounds in contexts serves multiple purposes.
For example,it can be used to study cross-lingual variations in compounding.
We showed in an additional experimenthow the cross-lingual evidence found in the multilingual database can be used to bracket English three-noun compounds using cross-lingual spelling variation with a set of six phrase patterns.
We achieved abracketing accuracy of 91.6% that is very close to human performance.In future work, we plan to continue refining the definition of compoundhood in a cross-lingual setting.We will experiment with additional linguistic criteria defined over multiple languages.
This way, we hopeto improve the quality of the multilingual database that we will further explore for compound analysisand translation.AcknowledgementsThis research was funded and supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsge-meinschaft, DFG) as part of the SFB 732.
