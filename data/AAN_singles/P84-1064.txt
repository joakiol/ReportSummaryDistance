A COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF DISPOSITIONSLotfi A. ZadehComputer Science DivisionUniversity of California,Berkeley, California 94720, U.S.A.ABSTRACTInformally, a disposition is a proposition which is prepon-derantly, but no necessarily always, true.
For example, birdscan fly is a disposition, as are the propositions Swedes areblond and Spaniards are dark.An idea which underlies the theory described in thispaper is that a disposition may be viewed as a propositionwith implicit fuzzy quantifiers which are approximations to alland always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently,etc.
For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as theresult of supressing the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposi-tion most birds can fly.
Similarly, young men like young womenmay be read as most young men like mostly young women.
Theprocess of transforming a disposition into a proposition isreferred to as ezplicitation or restoration.Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaningof a proposition through the use of test-score semantics(Zadeh, 1978, 1982).
In this approach to semantics, the mean-ing of a proposition, p, is represented as a procedure whichtests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which areinduced by p.The paper closes with a description of an approach toreasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of afuzzy syllogism.
Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has animportant bearing on commonsense reasoning as well as onthe management of uncertainty in expert systems.
As a sim-ple application of the techniques described in this paper, weformulate a definition of typical ity- a concept which plays animportant role in human cognition and is of relevance todefault reasoning.1.
Int roduct ionInformally, a disposition is a proposition which is prepon-derantly, but not necessarily always, true.
Simple examples ofdispositions are: Smoking is addictive, exercise is good for yourhealth, long sentences are more difficult to parse than short sen-tences, overeating causes obesity, Trudi is always right, etc.Dispositions play a central role in human reasoning, sincemuch of human knowledge and, especially, commousenseknowledge, may be viewed as a collection of dispositions.The concept of a disposition gives rise to a number ofrelated concepts among which is the concept of a dispositionalpredicate.
Familiar examples of unary predicates of this typeare: Healthy, honest, optimist, safe, etc., with binary disposi-tional predicates exemplified by: taller than in Swedes are tallerthan Frenchmen, like in Italians are like Spaniards, like inyoun 9 men like young women, and smokes in Ron smokescigarettes.
Another related concept is that of a dispositionalcommand {or imperative) which is exemplified by proceed withcaution, avoid overexertion, keep under refrigeration, be frank,etc.To Protessor Nancy Cartwright.
Research supported in part by NASAGrant NCC2-275 and NSF Grant IST-8320416.The basic idea underlying the approach described in thispaper is that a disposition may be viewed as a propositionwith suppressed, or, more generally, implicit fuzzy quantifierssuch as most~ almost all, almost always, usually, rarely, much ofthe time, etc .
To illustrate, the disposition gestating causesobesity may be viewed as the result of suppression of the fuzzyquantifier most in the proposition most of those who overeatare obese.
Similarly, the disposition young men like youngwomen may be interpreted as most young men like mostlyyoung women.
It should be stressed, however, that restoration(or ezplicitation) -- viewed as the inverse of suppression - is aninterpretation-dependent process in the sense that, in general,a disposition may be interpreted in different ways dependingon the manner in which the fuzzy quantifiers are restored anddefined.The implicit presence of fuzzy quantifiers tands in theway of representing the meaning of dispositional conceptsthrough the use of conventional methods based on truth-conditional, possible-world or model-theoretic semantics(Cresswell, 1973; McCawley, 1981; Miller and Johnson-Laird,1970),~-tn the computational pproach which is described inthis paper, a fuzzy quantifier is manipulated as a fuzzynumber.
This idea serves two purposes.
First, it provides abasis for representing the meaning of dispositions; and second,it opens a way of reasoning with dispositions through the useof a collection of syllogisms.
This aspect of the concept of adisposition is of relevance to default reasoning and non-monotonic logic (McCarthy, 1980; McDermott and Doyle,1980; McDermott, 1982; Reiter, 1983).To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy quantifiers maybe manipulated as fuzzy numbers, assume that, after restora-tion, two dispositions dI and d 2 may be expressed as proposi-tions of the formPl A Qt A t s are BI s (1.1)P2 A = Q2 Be s are CI s , (1.2)in which Ql and Q2 are fuzzy quantifiers, and A, B and C arefuzzy predicates.
For example,Pl &- most students are undergraduates (1.3)P2 ~ most undergraduates are young .By treating Pl and P2 as the major and minor premises ina syllogism, the following chaining syllogism may be esta-blished if B C A (Zadeh, 1983):1.
In the literature of linguistics, logic and philosophy oflanguages, fuz-zy quantifiers are usually referred to as ~agne or generalized quantifiers(Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Peterson, 1979).
In the approach describedin this paper, a fuszy quantifier is interpreted asa fuzzy number whichprovides an approximate characterization of absolute or relative cardi-nality.312Q1A ' s ore Bt  s (1.4)Q:  B I  s are CI s>_(QI ~ Q2) A#s  are C'sin which Q1 ~ Q2 represents the product of the fuzzynumbers QI and Q2 (Figure 1).II1-///--- ; Os so l  @ \[ a=bcPropor t ion02Figure 1.
Multiplication of fuzzy quantifiersand ~_(Ql ~ Q:t) should be read as "at least Q1 ~ Q2."
Asshown in Figure 1, Q~ and Q2 are defined by their respectivepossibility distributions, which means that if the value of Q1at the point u is a, then a represents the possibility that theproportion of A ~ s in B ~ s is u.In the special case where Pl and P2 are expressed by(1.3), the chaining syllogism yieldsmost students are undergraduatesmost nnderqradnates are vounqmost  2 students are youngwhere most ~ represents the product of the fuzzy number mostwith itself (Figure 2)./zI/ /most  =mostProportionFigure 2.

Meaning Representation and Test-Score SemanticsTo represent the meaning of a disposition, d, ~?e employa two-stage process.
First, the suppressed fuzzy quantifiers ind are restored, resulting in a fuzzily quantified proposition p.Then, the meaning of p is represented -- through the use oftest-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982) - as a procedurewhich acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory data-base and returns a test score which represents the degree ofcompatibility of p with the database.
In effect, this impliesthat p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraintswhich are tested, scored and aggregated by the meaning-representation procedure.
In test-score semantics, these elasticconstraints play a role which is analogous to that truth-conditions in truth-conditional semantics (Cresswell, 1973).As a simple illustration, consider the familiar exampled A snow is whitewhich we interpret as a disposition whose intended meaning isthe propositionp A usually snow is white .To represent the meaning of p, we assume that the ezplana-tory database, EDF (Zadeh, 1982), consists of the followingrelations whose meaning is presumed to be knownEDF A WHITE \[Sample;p\] + USUALLY\[Proport ion;p\],in which + should be read as and.
The ith row in WHITE isa tuple (Si,ri), i = 1,...,m, in which S i is the ith sample ofsnow, and ri is is the degree to which the color of S i matcheswhite.
Thus, r i may be interpreted as the test score for theconstraint on the color of Si induced by the elastic constraintWHITE.
Similarly, the relation USUALLY  may be inter-preted as an elastic constraint on the variable Proportion, withp representing the test score associated with a numerical valueof Proportion.The steps in the procedure which represents the meaningof p may be described as follows:1.
Find the proportion of samples whose color is white:r l -k  ?
?
?
-b  r mmin which the proportion is expressed as the arith-metic average of the test scores.2.
Compute the degree to which ?
satisfies the con-straint induced by USUALL Y:r ~ ~ USUALLY\[Proportion ~ p\] ,in which r is the overall test score, i.e., the degree ofcompatibility of p with ED, and the notation~R\[X = a\] means: Set the variable X in the rela-tion R equal to a and read the value of the variablep.More generally, to represent the meaning of a dispositionit is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set.Specifically, if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourseU ---- {ul,...,u,}, then the sigma-count of A is defined as~Count(A ) = I:~pA(U~), (2.1)in which pA(Ui), i ---- l,...,n, is the grade of membership of u/in A (Zadeh, 1983a), and it is understood that the sum may berounded, if need be, to the nearest integer.
Furthermore, onemay stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership fallsbelow a specified threshold be excluded from the summation.The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation inwhich a large number of terms with low grades of membershipbecome count-equivalent to a small number of terms with highmembership.The relative sigma-count, denoted by ~ Count( B / A ), maybe interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A. Moreexplicitly,~Count (B /A  ) --~ ~Count(A fl B) (2.2)ECount(a ) 'where B D A, the intersection of B and A, is defined by313i tBnA(U) fUS/U)  ^ US(U), U e U ,where A denotes the s in  operator in infix form.
Thus, interms of the membership functions of B and A, the relativeslgma-count of B and A is given by~,#B(u,) A tin(u,) Z Count( B / A } = (2.3}~,tJa(u,)As an illustration, consider the dispositiond A overating causes obesity (2.4)which after restoration is assumed to read 2p A most of  those who overeat are obese .
(2.5)To represent the meaning of p, we shall employ an expla-natory database whose constituent relations are:EDF ~- POPULATION\[Nome;  Overeat; Obese\]+ MOST(Proportion;it\] .The relation POPULA T ION is a list of names of individuals,with the variables Overeat and Obese representing, respec-tively, the degrees to which Name overeats and is obese.
InMOST, p is the degree to which a numerical value of Propor-tion fits the intended meaning of MOST.To test procedure which represents the meaning of pinvolves the following steps.1.
Let Name~, i - -  1 ..... m, be the name of ith indivi-dual in POPULATION.
For each Name,  find thedegrees to which Namei overeats and is obese:ai A POVEREA r(Namei) A 0 .....  t POPULA T/ON(Name = Namei\]#, A ItonEsE( Namei} ~ o6,, POPULA TlON\[Name ~ Namei\] .2.
Compute the relative sigma-count of OBESE inOVEREAT:=ia i  A #i p @ ~Count (OBESE/OVEREAT)=E,a i3.
Compute the test score for the constraint inducedby MOST:r -~  ~MOST\[Proportion --~ p\] .This test score represents the compatibility of p with theexplanatory database.3.
The Scope of a Fuzzy  Quantif ierIn dealing with the conventional quantifiers all and somein flint-order logic, the scope of a quantifier plays an essentialrole in defining its meaning.
In the case of a fuzzy quantifierwhich is characterized by a relative sigma-count, what mattersis the identity of the sets which enter into the relative count.Thus, if the sigma-count is of the form ECount (B /A  ), whichshould be read as the proportion of B Is  in A Is, then B andA will be referred to as the n-set \[with n standing for numera-tor) and b-set (with b standing for base), respectively.
Theordered pair {n-set, b-set}, then, may be viewed a~ a generali-zation of the concept of the scope of a quantifier.
Note, how-ever, that, in this sense, the scope of a fuzzy quantifier is asemantic rather than syntactic oncept.As a simple illustration, consider the propositionp A most students are undergraduates.
In this case, the n-set of most is undergraduates, the b-set is students, and thescope of most is the pair { undergraduates, tudents}.2.
It should be understood that (2.5) is just one of many possible in-terpret~.tions f (2.4), with no implicat;on that is constitutes a prescrip-tive interpretation f causality.
See Suppes (1970}.As an additional illustration of the interaction betweenscope and meaning, consider the dispositiond A young men like young women .
(3.1)Among the possible interpretations of this disposition, weshall focus our attention on the following (the symbol rddenotes a restoration of a disposition):rd I A most young men like most young womenrd 2 A most young men like mostly oung women .To place in evidence the difference between rd I and rdz,it is expedient to express them in the formrdl -~- most young men PIrd 2 ~ most young men P2 ,where Pl and P2 are the fuzzy predicatesPl  A likes most young womenandP2 A likes mostly young women ,with the understanding that, for grammatical correctness, likesin PI and P2 should be replaced by llke when Pl and P2 actas constituents of rd I and rd 2.
In more explicit terms,PI and P2 may be expressed asPI A P,\[Name;p\] (3.2)P2 ~- P2\[Name;p\],in which Name is the name of a male person and # is thedegree to which the person in question satisfies the predicate.\[Equivalently, p is the grade of membership of the person inthe fuzzy set which represents the denotation or, equivalently,the extension of the predicate.
)To represent the meaning of PI and P2 through the useof test-score semantics, we assume that the explanatory data-base consists of the following relations (gadeh, 1983b):EDF A POPULATION(Name;  Age; Sex\] +L lKE\[Namel ;Name2;  p\] + YOUNG(Age; p\] +MOST(Proportion; It\] .In LIKE, it is the degree to which Namel likes Name9 ;and in YOUNG, it is the degree to which a person whose age isAge is young.First, we shall represent the meaning of PI by the follow-ing test procedure.1.

For each Namei, find the degree to which Name i isyoung:ai A ~YOUNG\[Age=Ai  \] ,where a i may be interpreted as the grade of314membership of Name i in the fuzzy set, YW,  ofyoung women.4.

For each Name/ find the degree to which Name,likes Name i and Name i is young:"Tii A ai  A #ii ?Note: As in previous examples, we employ the aggre-gation operator ain (A)  to represent the meaningof conjunction.
In effect, 70 is the grade ofmembership of Name i in the intersection of thefuzzy sets WLI and YW.7.
Compute the relative sigma-count of women whomName i likes among young women:Pi A ~Count tWL i /YW)  (3.4)ECount (WL i N YW)~Count( YW)_ ~i  76a iF.

Compute the test score for the constraint inducedby MOST:r i = ~ MOST\[Proportion ---- Pi\] (3.5)This test-score way be interpreted as the degree towhich Name i satisfies PI, i.e.,ri = p PI \[Name = Namei\]The test procedure described above represents themeaning of P,.
In effect, it tests the constraintexpressed by the propositionE Count ( Y W/WL i ) is MOSTand implies that the n-set and the b-set for thequantifier most in PI are given by:n-set  = WLi = N.,.,2LIKE\[Name 1 - -~  Namei\]fl F .POPULA T IONandb-set = YW = YOUNG fl F .POPULA T ION .By contrast, in the case of P2, the identities of then-set and the b-set are interchanged, i.e.,n-set  = YWandb-set = WL i ,which implies that the constraint which defines P2 isexpressed byECount( YW\ [  WLi) is MOST .9.10.11.Thus, whereas the scope of the quantifier most in PIis {WLi ,  YW},  the scope of mostly in P2 is{ YW, WL~}.Having represented the meaning of P1 and P~, itbecomes a simple matter to represent the meaningof rd, and rd~.
Taking rd D for example, we have toadd the following steps to the test procedure whichdefines P rFor each Namei, find the degree to which Name i isyoung:6i A uYOUNG\[Age = Bi\] ,where /f i may be interpreted as the grade ofmembership of Name i in the fuzzy set, YM, ofyoung men.Compute the relative sigma-count of men who haveproperty P* among young men:6 &-- ~Count (P l /YM )~Count(P i  fl YM)Count(YM)~iri A $i~i~iTest the constraint induced by MOST:r = ~MOST\[Proportion=--p\] .The test score expressed by (3.6) represents theoverall test score for the dispositiond A young men like young womenif d is interpreted as rd 1.
If d is interpreted as rd2,which is a more likely interpretation, then the pro-cedure is unchanged except hat r i in (3.5) should hereplaced byr i = ~MOST\[Proportion -~- 6i\]where6, A ~Count (YW/WL, )4.
Representation of Dhspos|tlonal Commands andConceptsThe approach described in the preceding sections can beapplied not only to the representation f the meaning of dispo-sitions and dispositional predicates, but, more generally, tovarious types of semantic entities as well as dispositional con-cepts.As an illustration of its application to the representationof the meaning of dispositional commands, considerdc A s tay  away from bald men , (4.1)whose explicit representation will be assumed to be the com-m andc A s tay  away from most  bald men .
(4.2)The meaning of c is defined by its compliance criterion (gadeh,1982) or, equivalently, its propositional content (Searle, 1979),which may be expressed asee A staying away from most bald men .To represent the meaning of ce through the use of test-score semantics, we shall employ the explanatory database315EDF A RECORD\[Name; pBald; Action\]+ MOST\[Proposition; #\]  .The relation RECORD may be interpreted as a diary --kept during the period of interest -- in which Name is thename of a man; pBald is the degree to which he is bald; andAction describes whether the man in question was stayed awayfrom (Act ion~l )  or not (Action=0).The test procedure which defines the meaning of dc maybe described as follows:1.
For each Name i, i~ I  ..... n, find (a) the degree towhich Namel is bald; and (b) the action taken:#Baldi A ,B~IdRECORD\[Name --.
Namei\]Action i A a~tionRECORO\[Nam e --.
Namei\] .2.
Compute the relative sigma-count of compliance:1 \[~i pBaldl A Acti?ni}" (4.3) p=- -#3.
Test the constraint induced by MOST:r = ~MOST\[PropoMtion = p\] ?
(4.4)The computed test score expressed by (4.4)represents the degree of compliance with c, while theprocedure which leads to r represents the meaning ofde.The concept of dispositionality applies not only to seman-tic entities such as propositions, predicates, commands, etc.,but, more generally, to concepts and their definitions.
As anillustration, we shall consider the concept of typicality -- aconcept which plays a basic role in human reasoning, especiallyin default reasoning '(Reiter, 1983), concept formation (Smithand Media, 1981), and pattern recognition (Zadeh, 1977}.Let U be a universe of discourse and let A be a fuzzy setin A (e.g., U A cars and A ~ station wagons).
Thedefinition of a typical element of A may be expressed in verbalterms as follows:t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.5)(a) t has a high grade of membership in A, and(b) most dements of ,4 are similar to t.it should be remarked that this definition should be viewed asa dispositional definition, that is, as a definition which mayfail, in some cases, to reflect our intuitive perception of themeaning of typicality.To put the verbal definition expressed by (4.5) into amore precise form, we can employ test-score semantics torepresent the meaning of (a) and (h).
Specifically, let S be asimilarity relation defined on U which associates wi~h each ele-ment u in U the degree to which u is similar to t ~.
Further-more, let S(t) be the Mmilarity clas~ of t, i.e., the fuzzy set ofelements of U which are similar to t. ~Vhat this means is thatthe grade of membership of u in S(t) is equal to #s(t,u), thedegree to which u is similar to t (Zadeh, 1971).Let HIGH denote the fuzzy subset of the unit intervalwhich is the extension of the fuzzy predicate high.
Then, theverbal definition (4.5) may be expressed more precisely in theform:t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.6)3.
For consistency with the definition of A, S must be such that if uand u I have a high degree of similarity, then their grades of member-ship in A should be close in magnitude.
(a) Pa( t )  is HIGH(b) ECount(S(t)/A ) is MOST.The fuzzy predicate high may be characterized by itsmembership function PHtCH or, equivalently, as the fuzzy rein-ton IIIGfI \[Grade; PL in which Grade is a number in the inter-val \[0,1\] and p. is the degree to which the value of Grade fitsthe intended meaning of high.An important implication of this definition is that typi-cality is a matter of degree.
Thus, it follows at once from (4.6)that the degree, r, to which t is typical or, equivalently, thegrade of membership of t in the fuzzy set of typical elementsof A,  is given byr = tHIGH\[Grade = t\] A (4.7)aMOST\[Proportion = ~, Count(S(t)/A \].In terms of the membe~hip functions of HIGH, MOST,Sand A, (4.7} may be written as\[ ~, Pstt, u) A PA( u) I r A V.-LF.
J' (4.8)where tHIGH, PMOSr, PS and PA are the membership functionsof HIGH, MOST, S and A, respectively, and the summationZu extends over the elements of U.It is of interest o observe that if pa( t )  ----- 1 and.s(t,n) = ~a(u) ,  (4.9)that is, the grade of membership of u in A is equal to thedegree of similarity of u to t, then the degree of typicality of tis unity.
This is reminiscent of definitions of prototypicality(Rosch, 1978) in which the grade of membership of an objectin a category is assumed to be inversely related to its "dis-tance" from the prototype.In a definition of prototypicality which we gave in gadeh(1982), a prototype is interpreted as a so-called a-summary.In relation to the definition of typicality expressed by (4.5), wemay say that a prototype is a a -summary of typical elementsof A.
In this sense, a prototype is not, in general, an elementof U whereas a typical element of A is, by definition, an cle-ment of U.
As a simple illustration of this difference, assumethat U is a collection of movies, and A is the fuzzy set ofWestern movies.
A prototype of A is a summary of the sum-maries {i.e., plots) of Western movies, and thus is not a movie.A typical Western movie, on the other hand, is a movie andthus is an element of U.5.
Fuzzy SyllogismsA concept which plays an essential role in reasoning withdispositions is that of a fuzzy syllogism (Zadeh, 1983c).
As ageneral inference schema, a fuzzy syllogism may be expressedin the formQIA'a are Bin (5.1)Q2 CI8 are D IsfQs E '  a are F~ awhere Ql and Q2 are given fuzzy quantifiers, Q3 is fuzzyquantifier which is to be determined, and A, /3, C, D, E and Fare interrelated fuzzy predicates.In what follows, we shall present a brief discussion of twobasic types of fuzzy syllogisms.
A more detailed description ofthese and other fuzzy syllogisms may be found in Zadeh(1983c, 1984).The intersection~product syllogism may be viewed as aninstance of (5.1) in which3166' ~ A and BEAAF A B andD ,and Qa= Q1 ~ Q2, i.e-, Qa is the product of QI and Q2infuzzy arithmetic.
Thus, we have as the statement of the syllo-gism:Q1A's  are B'  s (5.2)QT(A and B) '  s arc CI s(Q1 (~ Q2) A Is  are (Band C)ls ?In particular, if B is contained in A, i.e., PB --< PA, where PAand P8 are the membership functions of A and B, respec-tively, then A and B = B, and (5.2) becomesQ1A's  are Be s (5.3)Q~ B '  s arc CI s(QI ~ Q2) A 's  are (B andC) 's  .Since B and C implies C, it follows at once from (5.3)thatQ1A I s arc BI s (5.4)Q2 BI s are C'  s>(QI  ~ Q2) A ' s  arc C 's ,which is the chaining syllogism expressed by (1.4).
Further-more, if the quantifiers Q\] and Q2 are monotonic, i.e.,>- QI - -  Q1 and _> Q2 = Q2, then (5.4) becomes the productsyllogismQI A e s are B '  s (5.5)Q~ B Is  are C Is(QI ~ Q2) A ' s  ore C 'sthe case of the consequent conjunction syllogism, we \]nhaveC~_AE~_AF = B and D .In this ease, the statement of syllogism is:QI A's  are B 's  (5.0)Q:Afs  are C IsQa A e s are (B and C) Iswhere Q is a fuzzy number (or interval) defined by the ine-qualities0~(Q 1 ?
Q201)_~ Q _~ QI~)Q2, (5.7)where (~ , ~ ~ and @ are the operations of addition, subtrac-tion, rain and max in fuzzy arithmetic.As a simple illustration, consider the dispositionsdl A students are youngd 2 ~-- students are single.Upon restoration, these dispositions become the propositionsPl A most students are youngP2 A most students are singleThen, applying the consequent conjunction syllogism to Pl andP2, we  can  infer thatQ students are single and youngwhere2 most 01  <_ Q <_ most .
(5.8)Thus, from the dispositions in question we can infer the dispo-sitiond A students are ,ingle and youngon the understanding that the implicit fuzzy quantifier in d isexpressed by (5.8).6.
Negat ion of  DispositlonaIn dealing with dispositions, it is natural to raise thequestion: What happens when a disposition is acted upon withan operator, T, where T might be the operation of negation,active-to-passive transformation, etc.
More generally, thesame question may be asked when T is an operator which isdefined on pairs or n-tuples of disp?sitions.As an illustration, we shall focus our attention on theoperation of negation.
More specifically, the question whichwe shall consider briefly is the following: Given a disposition,d, what can be said about the negaton of d, not d?
For exam-ple, what can be said about not (birds can fly) or not (youngmen like young women).For simplicity, assume that, after restoration, d may beexpressed in the formrd A Q A W s are B Is  .
(6.1)Then,not d = not (Q A ' s ore B ' s ) .
(6.2)Now, using the semantic equivalence established in Zadeh(1978), we may writenot (Q A 's  are B 's )E (not  Q)A 's  ore B 'o  , (6.3)where not Q is the complement of the fuzzy quantifier Q inthe sense that the membership function of not Q is given byP,,ot Q(u).~- 1-pQ(u) ,0  < u < 1 .
(6.4)Furthermore, the following inference rule can readily beestablished (gadeh, 1983a):Q A ' s ore B '  s (0.5)~__ (ant Q ) A I s arc not B t o 'where ant Q denotes the antonym of Q, defined by~, , ,~(u)  = ~q(1-n) ,  o < u < 1 ,  (6.o)On combining (0.3) and (0.5), we are led to the followingresult:not(Q A # s are B'  s )= (6.7)>_ (oat (not q)) A ' o ore not Bt  ,which reduces tonot(q A's  are B ' * )= (0.8)(ant (not q)) A ' , are not B '  *if Q is monotonic (e.g., Q A most).As an illustration, if d A birds can fly and Q A most,then (0.8) yieldsnot (birds can fly) (ant (not most)) birds cannot f l y .
(o.g)It should be observed that if Q is an approximation toall, then ant(not Q) is an approximation to some.
For theright-hand member of (0.9) to be a disposition, most must be317an approximation to at least a half.
In this case ant \[not most\]will be an approximation to most, and consequently the right-hand member of (0.9) may be expressed -- upon the suppres-sion of most -- as the disposition birds cannot fly.REFERENCES AND RELATED PUBLICATIONSBarwise, J. and Cooper, R., Generalized quantifiers andnatural language, Linguistics and Philosophy 4 (1981)159-219.Bellman, R.E.
