This pa-per presents a general method that uses Random Forests to automatically extract keyphrases that can beused as very short summaries and to help in retrieval, classification and clustering processes.1   IntroductionA keyphrase is an important concept, presented either as a single word (unigram), e.g.
: 'extraction','keyphrase' or as a collocation, i.e., a meaningful group of two or more words, e.g.
: 'keyphrase extrac-tion'.
Keyphrases can be regarded as very short summaries and can be used for representing documentsin retrieval, classification and clustering problems.Nowadays, many documents (e.g.
web pages, articles) include multimedia consisting of text, imag-es and embedded videos.
In this case, the keyphrase extraction process should not be limited to thetextual data but also consider the audiovisual data.In this context, this paper proposes a novel framework for automatic keyphrase extraction fromdocuments containing text and images based on supervised learning and textual and visual features.2  Baseline Methods for Keyphrase ExtractionIn this section, we introduce the baseline methods we use for keyphrase extraction using textual andvisual information.2.1 Textual Keyprhase ExtractionIn all methods, words and terms that have a grammatical role for the language are excluded from thekey words list according to Fox's stop list.
This stop list contains 421 high frequency stop list words(e.g.
: we, this, and, when, in, usually, also, near).
(1) Term Frequency (TF): This method rates a term according to the number of its occurrences inthe text.
Only the N terms with the highest TF in the document are selected.
(2) Term length (TL): TL rates a term according to the number of the words included in the term.
(3) First N Terms (FN): Only the first N terms in the document are selected.
The assumption is thatthe most important keyphrases are found at the beginning of the document because people tend toplace important information at the beginning.
This method is based on the baseline summariza-tion method which chooses the first N sentences.
This simple method provides a relatively strongbaseline for the performance of any text-summarization method.
(4) Last N Terms (LN): Only the last N terms in the document are selected.
The assumption is thatthe most important keyphrases are found at the end of the document because people tend to placetheir important keyphrases in their conclusions which are usually placed near to the end.121(5) At the Beginning of its Paragraph (PB): This method rates a term according to its relative posi-tion in its paragraph.
The assumption is that the most important keyphrases are likely to be foundclose to the beginning of their paragraphs.
(6) At the End of its Paragraph (PE): This method rates a term according to its relative position inits paragraph.
The assumption is that the most important keyphrases are likely to be found closeto end of their paragraphs.
(7) Resemblance to Title (RT): This method rates a term according to the resemblance of its sen-tence to the title of the article.
Sentences that resemble the title will be granted a higher score.
(8) Maximal Section Headline Importance (MSHI): This method rates a term according to its mostimportant presence in a section or headline of the article.
It is a known that some parts of papersare more important from the viewpoint of presence of keyphrases.
Such parts can be headlinesand sections as: abstract, introduction and conclusions.
(9) Accumulative Section Headline Importance (ASHI): This method is very similar to the previ-ous one.
However, it rates a term according to all its presences in important sections or headlinesof the article.
(10) Negative Brackets (NBR): Phrases found in brackets are not likely to be keyphrases.
Therefore,they are defined as negative phrases, and will grant negative scores.These methods were applied to extract and learn keyphrases from scientific articles (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2005).2.2 Visual Keyprhase ExtractionOn the other hand, visual keyphrase extraction is performed for a pre-defined set of keyphrases (e.g.demonstration, moving car, etc.).
The predefined keyphrases are selected in order to be relevant to thedomain of interest.
In the following, low level visual features (SIFT, SURF) are extracted (Markato-poulou, et al., 2013).
We apply supervised machine learning using Random Forests (RF) (Breiman,2001) to detect the presence of each concept in an image.
RF have been successfully applied to severalimage classification problems (e.g.
(Bosch et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2012)).
Moreover, an important mo-tivation for using RF was the application of late fusion based on the RF operational capabilities, whichis discussed below.In the training phase, the feature vectors from each low level feature vector are used as input for theconstruction of a single RF.
The training set can be constructed either manually or automatically.
Inthe automatic case, we submit a text query to a general purpose web search engine (e.g.
Google, Bing)to retrieve relevant images, while irrelevant images can be selected randomly from the web.
From theRFs that are constructed (one for each descriptor), we compute the weights for each modality in thefollowing way.
From the out-of-bag (OOB) error estimate of each modality?s RF, the correspondingOOB accuracy values are computed.
These values are computed for each concept separately.
Then thevalues are normalized and serve as weights for the different modalities.
Finally, each image is repre-sented with a vector that includes the scores for each predefined visual keyphrase.It should be noted that the visual concept/keyphrase detectors perform decently for specific visualconcepts (e.g.
news studio: 0,5 MEIAP (Mean Extended Inferred Average Precision)), while for someothers (e.g.
bridge: 0,02MEIAP) the performance is very low (Markatopoulou, et al., 2013).
Therefore,the representation is based on visual concepts for which the trained models can perform decently.3   The Proposed Supervised Extraction ModelOur model, in general, is composed of the following steps:For each document:(1) Extract all possible n-grams (n=1, 2, 3) that do not contain stop-list words.
(2) Transform these n-grams into lower case.
(3) Apply all baseline textual extraction methods on these n-grams.
(4) Apply variable selection using Random Forests on all textual features (the results of the textualbaseline methods) in order to find the best combination of the textual features (Genuer, et al.2010).122(5) Extract visual keyphrases for each image and calculate the average score for each visualkeyphrase to represent the document.
(6) Apply variable selection using Random Forests on all visual features in order to find the best per-forming visual features (Genuer, et al.
2010).
(7) After the feature selection two fusion techniques are investigated:a.
Early fusion: Concatenation of the textual and visual vectors in a single vector.
In the caseof unsupervised tasks (e.g.
retrieval, clustering) the L1 distances between these vectors areconsidered to compute similarity measures.
In supervised tasks (e.g.
classification) we traina RF with the concatenated vector using as training set manually annotated documents.b.
Weighted late fusion: In the case of unsupervised tasks similarity scores are computed in-dependently for each modality and the results are fused.
In order to calculate the weights aregression model based on Support Vector Machines is applied.
In the case of supervisedtasks we train two RF (i.e.
one for each modality) using a manually constructed training setand finally we apply weighted late fusion based on the OOB error estimate using the ap-proach mentioned in chapter 2.4   Conclusions and Future WorkThe proposed approach is work in progress so specific results are not yet available.
However, initialresults using weighted late fusion (based on OOB estimate) of textual features and visual low levelfeatures for a representative (i.e.
histograms and not concepts) have shown that the results are im-proved when compared to the ones generated with using only textual features.
The next steps of thiswork include application of the proposed method to retrieval, clustering and classification problems ofweb pages and news articles, which include multimodal information such as text and images.Future directions for research are: (1) Developing additional baseline methods for keyphrase ex-traction, (2) Applying other ML methods in order to find the most effective combination betweenthese baseline methods, (3) Conducting more experiments using additional documents from additionaldomains (5) Development of Methodology for predefined visual concept selection, and (6) ApplyingML to extract keyphrases using both textual and low level visual features.Concerning research on additional domains, there are many potential research directions.
For in-stance the following research questions can be addressed: (1) Which baseline extraction methods aregood for which domains?
(2) Which are the specific reasons for methods to perform better or worse ondifferent domains?
(3) Which are the guidelines to choose the correct methods for a certain domain?
(4) Can the appropriateness of a method for a domain be estimated automatically?Acknowledgment: This work is supported by MULTISENSOR project (FP7-610411) partially fundedby the European Commission.
