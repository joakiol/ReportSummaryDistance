been asm'ies oP ae('ounts of coordina.tion i volving various de-letion me(:halfisms (FIYOHI (~.g.
Gldtman, 1965 to vm~()i\]:sOUW, 1987).
For exmnple, \['rom the following 'an-tee:edellt' se.\[ltellCe.~5) Sue gaw: l"rcd a book by Chomsky and Sue gavePeter ~ paper I)y Chomskyvan Oirsouw ~dlows deletion of words to the left andto t\]le right of the conjunction,g~8 ~,~gl)eter a i)apcr t)y Chomslcyresulting in the sentence:6) Sue gave Fred ~ book aud Peter a. l)a.per by (Jhom-skyMost deletion ac(:otmts assume that, deletion is l)erfol>reed under idctitity of words, httt don't amdyse whatit means for two words to I)e i(lentleal (an ex('cptionis van Oirsouw who diseussc.s 1)honological, lnorpholo-gic~d and referential identity).

Now con-sider:8) a * John bored \[the new hole\] and \[his f>llow wor-kers\]1) * Mary came in \[a hurry\] and \[a taxi\]These are cases of 'zeugma' and are unacceptable ex-cept as jokes.
It therelbre seems that the deletedwords must have the same major syntactic category,and the same lexical meamng.lIowever, even if we fix both syntactic (:ategory andlexieal meaning, we still get some weird coordinations.For example, consider:9) a * Sue  sawi  the  man j  \ [ th rough the  te lescope\] /and \[with the troublesome kid\]jb *1 saw \[a friend of\] and \[the manuthcturer oilMary's handbagIn example (3) the two prepositions are attached if-ferently, one to the verb saw, the other to the noun,man.
In exmnple (b), attributed to Paul I)ekker, thetwo coRjunets require Mary's handbag to have a d i fferent syntactic structure: the bracketing appropriate\['or the first coajunct is \[\[a friend of Marv/' s handbag\].The unacceptability of these examples uggests thatword by word identity is insufficient, and that deletedmaterial must have identicM syntactic structure, aswell as identical exieal meanings.Some of the most compelling arguments against de-letion have been semantic.
For examqfle, Lakoff andPeters (1969) argued that deletion accounts are inappropriate tbr certain constituent coordinations uchgtS :10) John and Mary are alikesince the 'antecedent' sentence John are alike andMary arc alike is nonsensical (it is also ungrannna-tieal if we consider number agreement).However, semantically inappropriate or nonsensi-cM 'antecedents' are also possible when we considernon-constituent coordination.
For example, consider'antecedents' for the lbl lowing:\] 1) *t \[The man who buys\] and \[the woman who sells\]rattlesnakes met outsideb Many former \[soldiers living in England\] and\[resistance members living in N:an(:e\] have.
si-milar memoriesc John sold dill>rent dealers \[a vase using his in-tensive sales technique\] and \[a bookcase usinghis market-stM/ technique\]( l lb)  is non-constituent coordination under the pri-mary reading where the scope of founer  does not con-tain living in England i.e.
where the semantic bracke-ting is:12) \[\[former soldiers\] living in England\]Examples (a) and (b) could be expanded out at theNP level, but not at the S level, l\]owever (e) can-not be expanded out at any constituent level, whitsLretaining an a.ppropriate semantics.
For exan~ple, x-pansion at the V1 ) level gives:13) John sold different dealers a vase using his inten-sive sales technique and different dealers a book-ease using his market-staJ1 technique'\['lms, although I,akoff and Peters' argmnenls countagainst standard deletion analyses, they do not coulltas general arguments against a unified treatment ofconstituent a,nd non-constituent coordination.SHARED STR.UCTUREConsider the sentence:14) John gave Mary a book m\]d Peter a. paper byChomskyInstead of thinking of John 9ave and b.!\] Uhomsky asdeleted, we can also think of them as shared 1)y thetwo conjuncts.
This strncture can be represented asfollows:Mary  a bo{}kJohn gave a~M l)y ChomskyPet, m" a paperFrom the result of the previous ection, cac.h (-onjm~ctmust share not just the phonological materiM, butMso the syntactic structure and the lexieal meanings.There are three main methods by which this sharingof structure can be achieved: phrasal coordination, 3-D coordination, and processing stra.tegies.PHRASAL COORDINAT IONAt first sight, analysing nou-constitnent coordinationusing phra.sal (i.e.

This is not the case.
(2)or(linations areclassified as non-constituent coordination if' the con-juncts fail to be constituents in a 'sta.n&~rd' phrasestructure grammar.

In particular, it does not help toexclude examples (9a) and (gb) which suggest sharedmaterial must have identical syntactic structnre.
Ho-wever, once we have started to think in terms of mer-ging, there is an obvious next step, which is to movef'rom inerging of word strings to rnerging of synt;axtrees.
This is the move made by Goodall (1!
)87), whoadvocates treating coordination as a. union of phrasemarkers: '% 'pasting together' one or, top of the otherof two trees, with any identical nodes tnergil~g to-gether" ((;oo(hdl, 1987, p.20).
We can visualise theresult in terms o\[' a three-dimensional tree structure,where the merged material is on one plane, and thesyntax trees for each eonjmlct are on two other pla-nes.
For example, consider the a-l) tree for example(17a.)

IThe merged part of' the tree inch,des all the nodeswhich dominate the shared matel:ial Sue gave.
Thecoujmlets retain separate pla.nes (denoted here \] Uusing dot, ted and dashed lines respectively).
(k)odall's aeco,mt does not deal with examples uchas (171)), which he argues to I)e examples of'a differentphenomcaon, llowew;r flmse can be incorporated intoa ad)  aeco,nt (e.g.
Moltmamh 1992).There are various technical difliculties with Gee-dali's account (see e.g.
van Oirsouw, 1987, and Molt-nmnn, 11992).
There is also a f'undanmnl,al l)lro-blem COl,cerning semantic interpretation of coordina-ted structures (see Moltmanu, 1992 which providesa revised a.nd more complex 3-1) account based onMuadz, 1991).\["ot: coordinatioll el' unlike categories, as in the ex-amples in (15), Goodatl proposes a treatment somewhat similar to Sag el; al.
(1985).
I\[owe.w~r there isstill a problem in dealing with examples where thereare clit\[>rent urnbers of modifiers, such as (19a) orthe lbllowing:20) a.
We can meet at the office or in London outsidethe theaureb 'FNT deliver efficiently and after 5pro in Edin-burgh(~onsider example (b).
The synl;ac\[~ic structure appro-priate for "FNT' deliver eJficicnthd has one S node andtwo VP nodes, llowever, the structure fbr 7'N7' dell-vet after 5pro in l','dinbm~h requires one S node andthree VP nodes (or three S nodes and one VP node).The two structures therefore fail to merge since thestructure dominating the shared material 7'N7' de-liver must be identical.
The nse of ordered phrasestructure trees also excludes examples uch as (19b) .\]n summary, the /I-l) approaches correctly enforceidentity of synta.ctic structure for shared material.ltowever, the way of characterising syntactic struc-ture using (parts of) st, andard phrase structure treesresults in a.n overly strict requirement of parallelismbetween the conjnncts.
We will now consider pro-cessiug strategies, where syntactic structure of sharedmaterial is eharacterised more indirectly by the stateof the parser.PROCESSING STRATEGIESThere have been several attempts to trea.t coordi-nation by adapting pre-existing parsing strategies.For example, NFNs were adapted by Woods (1973),I)CGs by Dahl and MeCord (198:1), and chm:t parsersby lfaugeneder (\[992).
Woods and Dahl & McCord'ssystem are similar, ltaugeneder's system has very li-mi ted coverage.In Wood's SYSCONJ system, the pa.rscr can backap to various points in the history of the parse, andparse the second conjunct according to the configura.-lion fouud.
I"or example, in parsing,21) John gave some books to l)eter and some papersI;o Georgeat the point after encountering and, the parser canreaecess the configuration after parsing John gave i.e.a stack consisting of a sentence and a. verb phrase, andan arc traversal by the verb.
The second eoldnnct isthen parsed according to this contlguration.SYSCON./ does not imlnediately merge the twostack configurations after completing the second con-.iunct, bnt, ins,ca.d, separa.tely parses both conjunctsin para.lM until a constituent is completed.
For ex-ample, on parsing the sentence,22) John gave Mary a book and Peter a paper aboutsubj acen cytim SYSCONJ systean sepa.rateIy parses Peter a paperabout subjaceney and Mar9 a book about s.abjacencgbefore conjoining at the level of some enclosing con-stituent (for example \[.he verb phase).
The result istheretbre similar to starting with the sentence:23) .Jolm gave Mary a I)ook about, subjaeency andgave Peter a paper about subjacencyAs noted by Dahl and McCord, this meehanisrn meansthat SYSCONJ inherits the problems of nonsensicalsemantics which plague the deletion accounts, sinceJohn and Mart  arc alike is treated the same as ,Jo/u~a~v alike a~d Mart  arc alike.
The mechanism adsocauses problen,s \[br dealing with nested coordination.938Consider the sentence:2d) John wanted to study medic ine when he was elc-.ven, law when he was twc'lve, and to s tudy  no-th ing at all when he was eighteenThe  smal lest  constituenL conta in ing to siudg medicinewhen he was eleven is the verb phase wanted to studymedicine 'wh~m hc 'It;as clcve:n. \]lowevcr, if coordina-tion of the first two conjunets  occurs at tl~is level, it;is diflicull, to see how to deal with the final coidunet.Both Woods and l )ahl  ,% McOord usc stack basedconf igurat ions rather than  ~ lifll pars ing history.
'\] 'husonce someth ing  is popped off the stack its internals t ructure  cannot  bc accessed by the coordinat ion rot,-t int.
Th is  rules ont exmnplcs  uch as the following,25) John gaw'~ some books to Mary and papers to Gc-orgjcwhere the NP, some books is COlnpleted prior to theconjunction being reached.Al though I)rocessing a(;cOltlltS call provide reasonal)le coverage of the coordinat ion data,  the exactpredict ions often require detaile.d examinat ion  of thecode.
Th is  suggests  a need for the more absl, ract levelof descript ion which dynamic  grammars  I)rovidc.DYNAMIC GRAMMARSI )ynamics is ,lust the s tudy of states and transiLionsbetween sta~es.
It can be used to specify the states ofa left; to r ight parser and the possible mapp ings  10et-ween states,  l"or example,  Mi lward (:1992b) providesa dynamic  descr ipt ion o\[' a shift reduce l)arscr, and adynamic  descript ion of a fully incremental  parser I)a-sod on dependency grammar .
Suitable languages fordynamics  arc both forma.l and declarative., and aretherefore also appropr iate  to exl)ress l inguist ic gcne-ral isations.liu a l )yumnic  Grammar  (Milward 199210), eachwood is regarded as an aetion whi(:h I)erforms somechange in tim syntact ic  and semant ic  context,  Forcxaml)lc, a parse of the seutcnce John likes Mary be-tomes  a mapp ing  between an initial state,  ci, throughsome intermediate  states,  c , ,  el, to a final state c/ i.e..Ioh~z likes Mar9(; i  ~-> C a t--} C b g-} (;jI f we use a dynamic  grammar  to dcseril)c a shift re-duce parser, s tates encode the current stack configu-ration, and are related by rules which corrcsl)ond toshilTting and reducing a Since there are arl)itl:arilylarge, numbers  of different stack conf igurat ions (thestack can I:)e of a.rbitrary size), the dynamics  for shiftreduce l)arsing involves the use of all infinite l/Ulrl-her o\[ states.
It thus differs from, say ATNs (WoodsSShlft corresl)onds to: L ~-,' <X> *L on input of a word,W, where L is a wtrlablc stmMing for a list of cat;thin'its, ',*' islist COllC~tl:enation, mid X is the category for W. l~(!duce co,'-rcsl)onds to <(;n ...

On is a phrase sl.l'u(:lAire rule of I, he gramm~w.1973), which have a tinite nmnber  of states,  augmen-ted by an explicit recursion mechan ism.Dynamic  grammars  can t)e presented as rewriteg rammars  by using transit ion types instead o\[' themore usual  S or NP.
For example,  to get the parseabove we need the lexieal entries: (~John:ciF-~ca likes:caP+% MaJ:y:cbr-Ocfaud a single combinat ion  rule.
schema which statesthat,l)k)r any C1, C2, C3,(?D-+C3 -4 C1~C2 C2~->(J3A str ing of words is a sentence if it has the tyl)e ,ci ~-->cfwhere ci and c/  are al)propriate initial and final statesfor a parse r.\[n a dynaln ic  g rammar ,  any substr ing of a sentence<;all be assigned a type.
\['%r example,  likes and Ma Wcan 10e combined to get the type ('aF~rcf.
Thus  wehave an appropr iate hwel to perform substr ing coo ldination.
Dynamic  grammars  may be extended usingthe following combinat ion  rule (arm and or are bothgiven the.

Howew~,r, since there is no poppingof a stack, the fnll pars ing history is awdlable s.

for examples uch as Mary,.Petc~" and Sue) can be treated ill tilt same way asiterated constituent coordination is treated in phrasestrncture grammars.
For example, each transitio~type can be augmented with a feature (+/-)  deno-ting whether or not; that transition has been iterated.The eoordination rule becomes:For miy C1, C2,(-JD+-C2 _,v C l io  1~/-(32 OONJ ( J t~-C2Iterated types are formed as follows:\]"or any O1, (J2,C1~0+O2 -o CI ~-FF/- C'2 O1~-+-(72The precise gl:amnlaticality predictions lnacle 1oythe dynamic approach depend npon the characteri-sation of the states, and hence depend oil the parti-eulal: l)arsing strategy which is specified by the (ly-naniics, tlowever there are some general predictionswhich can be inade.
Firstly, consider conjuncts whichcorrespond one t;o one ill the categories of the ee lresponding words.

An example(due to Mark Steedman), which may be sneh a case,is the following,30) * One lnan ill \[ten spoke against and twenty ac-t ually protested\]As noted above, the precise granunaticalil;y predic-tions depend on the kind of parsing lnodel which is en-coded in the states.
In Milward (1992a), the dynarnicsspecifies a word-by-word incremental parser lbr a lexi-calised version of dependency gramlnar.
Fach state isa recursively defined category, similar to ~/cal;egory inCategorial Gramlnar.
For exarnple, after parsing Youcan call me one possible state is a sentence missing asentence lnoditier 1?.
This state is appropriate as theinitial state R~r a parse of both dirccll?/, or of after,Tpm thro,ugh my sccTvtary, resulting in a final stateof category sentence.
Thus examples Stlch as (19a)are dealt with, since the syntactic context after Youcan call me dots not distingnish between one or lnorethan one subsequent modilier.
This lack of distinc-tion as to whethel: one or lnore modilier is expectedis actually a necessary prereqnisite \['or performing de-cidable fl,lly word-by-word incremental interpretation(see Milward and Cooper, 1994, in these proceedings).Some of the problelns with eategorial granlmar ac-counts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic ac-connt based on the parser used ill Milward (1992a).For exaniple,31) \[,/ohn\] and \[Mary thought hat l'eter\] sleptis predicted to 1oe a(x:eptable, as are the following,32) a \['lbd~ w John\] and \[mary thonght that Peter\]sleptI/ I he.ard \[that\] and \[that no-one else knew that\]Fred won the seholarshipThis second batch of examples is particularly dillicultto exclude withont malting changes to the eharacteri-sation of the states.
