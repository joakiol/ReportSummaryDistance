Word Boundary Identification fro m Phoneme Sequence Constraints in AutomaticContinuous Speech RecognitionJo~atha~t HARRINGTON Gordon WATSON Maggie COOPERThe Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, 80 South Bridge, EdinburghEH1 1HN, Scotland.AbstractTh.s paper explores the extent o which phoneme sequenceconstralnt'~ can be used to identify word boundaries in coutinnousspeech recog~fition.
The input consists of phonemic transcriptions(without word boundaries indicated) of 145 utterances produced by1 ~e speaker.
The constraints are derived by matching thecomplete set of 3 phonente sequences that can occur' across wordboundaries toentries in large lexicons containing both citation andreduced h)rm pronunciations.
Phonemic assimilatoxy adjushnentsacross word boundaries are alse taken into account.
The resultsshow that around 37% of all word boundaries can be correctlyidentified t rom a knowledge of .~uch phoneme sequence contraintsalone, and ~hat his figure rises to 45% when a knowledge of one-and two-phoneme words and all legal, word-initial and word-final,two-pitoneloe sequences are taken into account.
The possibility ofincluding :~uch constraints in tim architecture of a corrtinuousspeech reeogniser is discussed.I.
IntroductionTiLe identification of word boundaries fl'om continuousspeech by human listeners depends, in part, on an interactionbetween :prosodic, syntactic and semantic processing, Since,however, ~his interaction is difficult to model in machines andsince some prosodic variables, uch as sentence stress patterns, aredifficult to extract automatically from the acoustic waveform, theidentification of word bmmdaries must often be accomplished bydifferent hinds of processing in continuous ,~peeciL reeognisers: onepossibility~ discussed in Lamel & Zue (1984) and explored in thispaper, depends on the incorporation of a knowledge of' phonemesequence constraints, Phoneme sequence constraints are based on aknowledge of phoneme sequences which do not occur!
word-internally: for' example, since there are no words which endin/m g/~ at~d since/m g l/does not occur word-internally, a wordboundary must occur after/m/ (Lamel & Zue, 1984).
Harrington,Johnson & Cooper (1987) showed that word boundary CVCsequences are often excluded word-internally in monomorphemicwords if the pre- and post-vocalic onsonants are similar: thus,/s NV N/(N == nasal),/C l V l/,/f V p/,/g V ld,/z V ,iJ,/sh V sh/are all exchtded, or are at least extremely rare, word-internally inBritish English Received Pronunciation (top).
In the studydiscussed b.~low, we extend the investigations of Lamel & Zuei (1984) anti 1 larrington et al (1987) by developing an algorithm forthe autmmttic identification o~" word boundaries from suchsequences ina continuous speech recogniser.In the Alvey Demonstrator continuous speech recogniserbeing developed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research(CSTR), Edinburgh University (Figure 1), the identification ofword boundaries from a string of phonemes i accomplished by achart-parsing s~rategy which matches the lexicon fromleft-to-right against a string of phonemic symbols that arethemselve~ derived from the phonetic processing of theacoustic-waveform.
In this system, only cmnplete parsings of thephonemic units are passed to higher' levels for syntactic andsemantic processing.
The only possible parsing, therefore, of thephonemic string/t ii eh i ng w i 1/is teaching+will, since thereare no ether paths which parse the entire string of phonemes.TEACHTEAParameterised Acoustic Signal~bone~ Ruleshoneme Stdngt l i ch ingwi lCba P ~/ rt- arsing StratecJyTEACHING TEE "teaching willFig.
1: A schematic outline of the components between acousticwaveform and lexical access in one of the continuous peechrecognisers atEdinburgh University.The relationship between the identification of wordboundaries fl'om piloneme sequence constraints and thechart-parsing strategy outlined above can be clarified with respectto Figure 1: at all points where the arcs do not overlap, it should bepossible to in.~ert a word bour~dary from a knowledge of ptlonemesequence constraints.
Since, therefore, the only point at which thearcs are non-overlapping is between /ng/ and /w/, phonemesequence constraints stlould apply to insert a word boundary atthat point (there being no monomorphemic words in the Englishlanguage that contain a medial /ng w/).
At the same time,however, Figure 1 would seem to suggest that the prior"implementation f phoneme sequence constraints i superfluous,since all word boundaries can he found frmn the chart-parsingstrategy.
However, the application of phoneme sequenceconstraints may enable recovery when the chart-parsing strategyis unable to parse the phonemic string because of the incorrect:derivation of a particular phoneme.
Suppose, for example, that theacoustic-phonetic component incorrectly derives/el ng/from theparameteriscd acoustic wavetbrm instead of/i ng/(Figure 2).TEACHTEATEE~~~oi  3 ng--3 w \] i j ERROR:  cannotbe parsedFig.
2: The incorrect substitution of ~oil for /i/ makes the abovesequence unparsable since /ch oi ng7 occurs neitherword-internally nor across word boundaries.225In this case, a left-to-right chart-parsing strategy would break offa t /ch /because /ch  oi ng/ is  unparsable: there are no words thatend in/ch el/or begin with/el  r ig/and/el / is  not usually corrsideredto be a word (aside from an exclamation) in the English language.Since the strategy works from left-to-right, he phonemes which lieto the right of this error would also remain unparsed: thus willwould not be derived frmn /w i 1/, unless the chart-parsingstrategy were modified in some way to be able to cope with thiskind of error.
If, on the other hand, phoneme sequence constraintshad been applied, a word boundary would have been insertedbetween/ng/and/w/ .
This would enable immediate recovery fromthe kind of error described above: in this case, if the chart-parsingstrategy is unable to continue parsing phonemes at a particularpoint (from /ch/ to /el/ to /ng/) it can continue parsing from thefollowing word boundary (between /ng/ and /w/) that trod beenautomatical ly inserted by phoneme sequence constraints.
Theprior application of phoneme sequence constraints, therefore,breaks up a single str ing of phonemes into smaller units, whicb,from the point of view of the left-to-right chart-parsing strategy,are independent of each other.
A by-product of the prior insertionof word boundaries in this way is that the chart-parsing strategycould parse each of these units in paral lel (Figure 3).P a r a m e t ~ ~Phonetic Rules,I,meni  thangksfoosendi~ng mi idh@kop i  @v yoolet@Phoneme Sequence Constraint Processor#me ni # tha ngks #foose riding # n~iidh(i k o pi @v #yoo let@tApply Chart-Parsing Strategy in Parallel/ /  / / /#moni  # thangka  #foosend lng  #miidh@ ko pi @v #yoo le t@.I.m n thanks for ndm\]'me h a y se ' g t ecopyofyourlettevFig.
3: The prior application of phoneme sequence constraintswould enable the chart-parsing strategy to apply in parallel fromall the pre-identified word boundaries.Such a parallel strategy may be computationally faster than onewhich parses the str ing strictly from left-to-right.As in Harr ingt0n & Johnstone (1988), sentencestranscribed by a trained phonetician are used as the input data.The experiment does not take account, therefore, of any errorswhich may arise as a result of inaccuracies in the automaticextraction of the phonemes from the acoustic signal by thephonetic rule component of a continuous speech recogniser.2 Method I2.1 Word boundary sequencesIn order to identify phoneme sequences which are excludedword-internally (and which therefore signal the presence of a wordboundary), it is necessary to determine a priori the complete set ofthree phoneme sequences which can occur across word boundaries.For this purpose, a 'Word-lexicon' of the 23,000 most frequentwords (including many derivational and inflectionalmorphological variants and compounds) in part of theLancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus (Johannson, Leech & Goodluck,1978} was used with each word keyed to one citation form and zeroor more reduced form pronunciations.
The citation form entry,which is often identical to the one given in Gimson (1984),corresponds to a phonemicisation f an isolated production of theword at a moderately slow tempo.
The reduced forms includevariant phonemieisations of the same words which might occur infaster speech productions.
In general, three different kinds ofreduction rules are included: alternation rules in which segments226are in free variat ion (e.g./co k sh @ n/,/o k sh @ rg, auction);deletion rules in which single segments may be deleted (/o k sh n/from/o k sh @ n/, auction); and word-internal assimilat ion rules(/g u b b a t / f rom/g  u d b a~/, good-bye).
The rules do not take intoaccount phonological assimilation across word boundaries (seeHarrington, Laver & Cutt ing (1986) for further details of thereduction rules).
The reduced forms were derived from the citationforms by rule using a software package running on Xerox- l l00workstations in Interlisp-D (Cutting & Harrington, 1986).
Afterthe application of the reduction rules on the 23,000 word lexicon,around 70,000 reduced forms were derived (on average, ttmrefore,each word is associated with 4 different pronunciations).In order to derive the complete set of possible threephoneme sequences that occur across word boundaries, all finaltwo phonemes (PP#) were paired with all init ial  phonemes (#P) ofall citation and reduced forms, thus deriving the complete set ofPP#P sequences (where P is any phoneme); and all final phouenms(P#) were paired with the first two phonemes (#PP) of al l  citationand reduced forms thus deriving the complete set of P#PPsequences.
This pair ing operation produced a total of 62,670different hree-phoneme s quences.Subsequently, it was necessary to take into account someof the modifications to word boundary sequences which occur as aresult of assimilatory processes ince, as stated above, these werenot included in the reduction rules.
In order to take into accountthe realisation o f / r / in  phrases uch as/dh e@ raa  m e n i/ (thereare many) and ' intrus ive/r f  (/dh ii a id  i @ r i z/, the idea is), thesequences in (1) were paired with all word-initial vowel phonemesthat occurred in the Word lexicon:(1) /U@ r, e@ r, i@ r, @ r, @@ r, oo r, aa r/thus deriving, for example, /@ r# i /(measure is),/aa r # au/ ( farout) etc.
In addit ion, / r /was paired with all #VP sequences in theWord-lexicon where V is any word-initial vowel and P is anyphoneme.
This pair ing operation results in sequences such as / r  #i z,J (measure is), /r # au t\] (far" out) etc.In order to account for the assimilation of alveolars tobilabials preceding bilabials, all PPt # sequences (where P is anyphoneme and Pt is one of /t,d,n/) were extracted from theWord-lexicon.
F inal / t \ ] , /d/ , /n/were th n changed to /p / , /b /and/m/respectively (thus the PPt # sequences/it t #/, / i t  d #/, / i t  n #/werechanged to/ i t  p #/ , / i t  b #/ , / i t  m #f).
The changed sequences werethen paired with the labial consonants/p,b,m,f,v,w/.
This pair ingoperation produces equences such as/ i t  p # b/(eat by),/on m # f/(shown few),~@@ m # w~ (burn wood).A simi lar  procedure was used to take account of theinstabi l i ty of some of the alveolars before palatals and velars asshown in Table 1 below./s/to/sh/: oo sh # sh sh # shuu  (horse shoe)/zJ to/zh/: i zh # sh zh # sh u@ (is sat'el/t/to/ch/: a ch # y eh # y oo (at your)/d/to/jh/: i jh  # y jh # y uu (didyou)It/to/k/: ai k # k k # k uh (might come)/dJ to/g/: i i g  # k g # k 1 (need cleaning)/n/to/ng/: e ng # k ng # k a (when can)Table I: Sonm of the word boundary assimilat ion cases consideredin the derivation of word boundary sequences.Consideration was given to some deletion rules across wordboundaries such as the deletion of the alveolar stop in / faa  .q # s p i iclr t, (fast speech).
In this case, a coraplete list of three-phonemesequences occurring word-finally was made from the Word-lexiconwhere the penult imate consonant was a fricative and the finalconsonant an alveolar stop.
The final alveolar stop was deleted andtile result ing two.phoneme sequence was tmired with all membersof iI'P ( thus /aa  s t #/ (j'hst) ->/aa  s #/ (first) ->/aa  s # ",;/, /b, stspeech).
All wm'd boundary sequences which resulted frmn theinclusion of these assinfi lation rules were added to the previouslyderived P#PP arm I'P#1 ) sequences, thus producing a total of69,819 wla'd boundary sequences.2.2 Word boundary sequences excluded word-lnl:m'nallyWe new wished to determine which word boundarysequences do not oecm" word- internal ly (since these enable tileautomatic  detection of a word boundary), t lowcver, it is clear fi'omthe phouolog 3 l i terature (Fudge, 1969; Cleruents & Keysm', 1983)that  sequential constraints on phonemes are ltot upheld aerossmany morpheme boundaries.

This implieseither that  tLroughout must be stm'ed its /th r uu # au t/ in thelexieou which tile chart -pars ing strategy matches against  thephonemic string, or else that  morphoh)gical rules must apply afterthe phoueme :m(tuencc constraint  processor to \['ell~.ove the medial #in throughout.A similar a rgument  applies to inflectional ntm'phemeboundaries.
\["or example, /n th s/ is excluded morphmne internal lyhut does occm" across stem/inflectional suffix boundaries (months).For the reasons outl ined above, morphoh)gical var iants  withregnlar  inflections (plm'ah;, present and past tense sufti?es) wereremoved from the Word-lexicon.

Thus, the matchingalgm'ithm steps through the input str ing one phoneme at a timewith a window width of three phonemes unti l  the end of the str ingis reached.Phonemic transcript ions (excluding stress or boundarysymbols) were made hy a trained phonetician of 145 sentencesproduced by one lip speaker.

However, there were 69automatically inserted # boundaries which did not correspond toword boundaries in the original utterances.
Of these, 14 wereincorrectly inserted because of the presence of reducedphonological forms in the utterances (e.g./w @ dh\] for with) whichwe had failed to generate by rule; and 7 were inserted becausesome words occurred in the utterances that had not been includedin the Word-lexicon (most of these were proper names).
44 #boundaries were inserted at morpheme boundaries, both incompounds (/h au # e v @/for however) and preceding inflectionalsuffixes (/s i '  m # z/ for seems).
In the next section, somemorphology rules ale described which attempt to convert he # atstem/suffix boundaries incases uch as/s i m # Z\] into morphemeboundaries.
Finally, 244 '?'
were inserted at appropriate points(i.e.
for each/P?QPJ, where/PQR/are phonemes, either/P#QP,/or/PQ#PJ occurred in the original utterances}.
The next section alsodescribes rules for converting some of these '?'
boundaries intodefinite # boundaries.4.
Method II4.1 Morphology rulesThe phonemic strings with the word boundaries insertedby the matching algorithm in Figure 4 are input to a second stageof processing which uses four additional sources of knowledge:PHON1 and PHON2 (a list of all one and two phoneme words inthe Morphology-lexicon) and #PP and PP# (a list of all legalword-initial and word-final two phoneme sequences).
Since thesedata are extracted from the Morphology-lexicon, they takeaccount of phonologically reduced variants, but not themorphological variants that were excluded from the Word-lexicon.The morphology rules test whether the two phonemes thatoccur to the right of an automatically inserted # are legal withrespect o PHON1, PHON2, #PP andPP#.
If they are not, theassumption is made that the # occurs across a stem/inflectionalmorpheme boundary.
Morphological rules are then applied to shiftthe # to the correct place, if possible.
Consider for example, thephrase boys and girls in... which, after the application of the first istage of processing, was analysed as:(2) bo i#zan?g@@l#z inThe insertion of the word boundaries at this first stage ofprocessing is attributable to the fact that neither /b oi Z\] nor/g..@@..1..z/ occurred in the Morphology-lexicon.
Furthermore,since there are no words that begin with/el Z\] nor/1 z/, the relevantsequences would be stored as/b oi # Z\] and/@@ 1 # z/in the tree inFigure 4.
The following test is now performed on the two phonemesto the right of the first # in (2):(3) If/z a/is not in #PP rewrite/el # z a/as/el M z # a/else rewrite/el # z a/as/el M?
z a/.228Informally, (3) states that if/z a/cannot begin words (according tothe Morphology-lexicon),/z/must be an inflectional suffix of theprevious word: therefore place an 'M' (morpheme boundary) before/Z\] and shift the # symbol to the right of/z\].
Alternatively, if/z a/does begin words in the Morphology-lexicon, it is impossible todetermine whether/z/is a plural suffix or the first phoneme of afollowing word.
In this case, M?
is used to denote these twopossibilities: it is an abbreviation for either/el M z # M or /el # za/.
In fact, since there are no words that begin with /z a/, (2) isanalysed as/M z # a\].
A solution with M?
would occur if boys arewere analysed at the first stage of processing as:(4) b oi # z aasince in this case/Z\] can also be the first phoneme of a word (Csar}.A test is often performed with respect o PHON1 and/orPHON2 rather than #PP.
This occurs in the following example, inwhich two # symbols have been automatically inserted in closeproximity at the first stage of processing:(5) b i g i n # z @ # t ai p # (begins a type)In this case, a test is made to determine whether/z @/occurs inPHON2 (i.e.
whether it is is a two phoneme word}.
Since it is not,(5) is reanalysed as/b.i g i n M z # @ # t ai p #/.The test in (3) above is only made if the structuraldescription of phonemes to the left and right of the # is met bycertain conditions.
Specifically, the test is performed in contextssuch a s those given in Table IILPAST TENSE{p, k, f, th, s, sh}# t (tapped, missed, wished)voiced phonemes xcluding/d\] #d (paved, seemed)PLURALS/PRESENT TENSE{p, t, k, f, th} # s (mats, picks, meets)voiced phonemes xcluding/z, h, jh /# z (tabs,sings)Table III: Some of the contexts in which the morplmlogy rulesapply.4.2 Resolving AmbiguitiesThe four sets of data PHON1, PHON2, #PP and PP# arealso used to convert some '?'
symbols into definite (#) wordboundaries.
In order to resolve the hypothetical ambiguity/ABC?DEF/, for example, it is first expanded into the two possiblecases it represents in (7) and (8) below:(7) ABC#DEF(8) ABCD#EFAn attempt isthen made to prove that either (7) or (8) is illegal (onthe basis that, if (7) is illegal, ABC?DEF must correspond to therepresentation in (8) and vice-versa).
(7) can be proved illegal if (9)is true:(9) Either C is not in PHON1 and BC is not in PP#Or D is not in PHON1 and DE is not in #PPAn informal interpretation of (9) is the following.
If C is not aone-phoneme word, test whether BC is a legal two-phonemesequence that can end words; if C is not a one-phoneme word andBC cannot end words, then (7) must be illegal.
Otherwise, if (7) icannot be shown to be illegal on the basis of the phonemes thatprecede #, the phonemes that follow # are considered.
In this caseif D is not a one-phoneme word and if" DE cannot begin a word, (7)must be illegal.
Otherwise, (7) cannot be shown to be illegal and sothe following (similar} test is applied to (8):(10) (8) is i l legal if:E ither D is not in PITON1 and CD is not in PP#Or E is not in PHON1 and EF is not in #PP.If neithm' (7) nor (8) cat, be proved illegal, the '?'
cannot be resolvedinto #.When two '?'
symbols occur in close proximity, anexpansion is made into fore" alternatives.
If t:hree of thealternatives can be proved illegal, both '?'
symbols can be resolvedas definite # symbols.
For exmnple, after the first stage ofprocessing, ;aeasuring the gun was analysed as:(11) /me~hr ing#dh?
@?guhn/This expamt:~ into the following alternatives:(12) /rn e dl r ing# dh # @ # g uh n/.
(13) /me e,h r ing#dh # @ g#uhn/,(14) hne  dt r ing#dh @##guhn/ .
(15) hnezhr ing#dh @ #g#uhn/ .
(12) and (13) nmst be il legal since h lh/ is  not a one-.phonenm word((13) is additionally i l legal since /@ g/ is not a possibletwo-phoneme word).
(15) is i l legal s ince/g/  is not a one-t)honemeword.
Theret ore (14) is the only possible analysis of (11).This type of expansion into four possibilities is only madewhen 3 phmtemes, or fewer, occur between the two '?'
symbols: ifmore than three phonemes intervene, the result of resolving both?
symbols together is the same as if each ?
symbol were consideredseparately.Finally, the example with two '?'
symbols in (11) isextended to the general ease in which n '?'
symbols occur in closeproximity to one another (i.e.
a series of n '?'
symbols with 3, orfewer, l)homanes between successive '?'
symbols).
These expandi~to 2 n alternatives.
As in the example above, if 2 n - l alternativescan be proved illegal, all r~ '?'
symbols can be converted to #symbols.4.3 Order of rulesAfter: the application of the first stage of the wordboundary in..~ertion rules, expansion rules apply in which each '?
'symbol is e~panded into two alternatives.
The morphology rulesapply to each of these expanded alternatives and at all otherpoints in the utterance at which their structural description is met.Only after ~;he morphology rules have applied can any of thealternates be eliminated.
The morphology rules must apply beforeel iminat ing alternatives, othm'wise some altm'natives might beincorrectly eliminated.
This can be i l lustrated with the exampleboys and girls which, after the first stage of processing, wasanalysed as/b oi # z a n ?
g @@ 1 # z/.
This expands into:(16) bo i#z  an#g@@l#z(17) bo i#z  an  g#@@l#zIf the el imination rules applied prior to morphological rules, both(16) and (17) would be eliminated, since /z a / i s  not in #PP (and(17) is i l legal s ince/n g / i s  not in PP#).
I~, on the other hand, themorphology rules apply first, (18) and (19) would be derived from(16) and (17) respectively:(18) bo iMz  #an#g@@lMz#(19) boi~'fz #an g#@@lMz#Only (19) would be eliminated, on the grounds that /n  g / i s  not alegal two-phoneme sequence occurring word-flnally.A further i l lustration of the interaction between theexpansion rules, morphological rules and el imination ofalternatives i shown in (20 - 33) below.
After the first stage ofprocessing, months tie (from a sentence in a gardening manual,'after a few months, tie in more growth') was analysed as /m uh nth ?
s t ?

But thesegments that intervene between an M and # are ignored.

;The results show that 645/1411 (45.7%) of the target wordboundaries were correctly detected.
This is an increase of around9% compared with the result obtained prior to the application ofthe rules described in the preceding section.
24 # boundaries wereinserted at inappropriate points, either because of the presence of229because of the presence of reduced forms in the utterances that wehad not derived by rule, or because of lexical items that had notbeen included in the word-lexicon.
All 21 inserted # symbols thatcorresponded to morpheme boundaries were inserted medially incompounds (e.g.
how#ever, there#fore), while all automaticallyinserted # symbols that had occurred at stem/inflectional suffixboundaries (/s..i..m..#..z/ for seems) were converted to M or M?symbols using the morphology rules described above.An approximate measure of the probability of a wordboundary being incorrectly inserted can be made as follows.Firstly, since it was our intention that the algorithm should insert# symbols not only between words but also within compounds, thetarget number of boundaries to be identified can be considered tobe 1411 (the number of word boundaries in the utterances) plus 78(the number of boundaries occurring within compounds), i'.e.
1489.Of these (see Table IV), 645 + 21 = 666 (44.7%) were correctlyinserted.
The probability of a word boundary being incorrectlyinserted, either as a result of a reduced form which was notderived by rule, or because of the omission of a word from theWord-lexicon, is given by:(36) (24/(666 ~}- 24) x 100) %6.
Discussion--- 3.5%.This study has shown that around 45% of all wordboundaries can be correctly identified from a knowledge ofthree-phoneme s quences that occur across word boundaries butwhich do not occur word-internally together with a knowledge ofone- and two-phoneme words and all two-phoneme s quences thatcan begin and end words.
The result is based onhand-transcriptions which can be considered analogous to thephonemic strings that would be extracted automatically from theacoustic speech signal if the recogniser made no errors in thisderivation.A current area of investigation is to identify the set ofphoneme sequences which occur neither" across a word boundarynor word-internally.
Such phoneme sequences can be easilyobtained from the data sets discussed in this paper and they wouldenable errors to be detected in the acoustic-phonetic stage ofprocessing in a continuous speech recogniser.
Some examples ofthese sequences are given in (37):(37) /1 z ng/,/aa dh l/,/e w n/For example, /e w n/ must be illegal since it does not occurword-internally and because it does not occur across wordboundaries (both/e # w rd and/e w # n/must be ruled out on thegrounds that there are no words which end in /e /o r /e  w/).
Theincorporation ofthis kind of knowledge would enable an error to bedetected ff such a sequence were derived automatically after theacoustic-phonetic stage of processing.7.
