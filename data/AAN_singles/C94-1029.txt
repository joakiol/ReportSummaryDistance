ukApr i l  22, 199dAbstractThis I)aper presents an implemented multi-tal)e two-level model capable of describing Semitie non-linearmorphology.
The computational fl'arnework behind theettrrcnt work is motivated by \[Kay 1987\]; the fimnal-ism presented here is an extension to the formalism re-ported by \[Puhnan art(1 Hepl)le.
1993\].
The objectivesof the current work are: to stay as close as possible,in spirit, to standard two-level morl)hology, to stayclose to the linguistic description of Semitic stems, andto present a model which can be used with ease bythe Semitist.
The.
Imper illustrates that if finite-statetransducers (FSTs) in a standard two-level morphologymodel are replaced with multi-tape attxiliary versions(AFSTs),  one can account for Semitic root-andq)atternmorphology using high level notation.1 INTRODUCTIONThis paper aims at presenting a computational mor-phology model which can handle the non-linearphenomenon of Semitic morphology.
The ap-proach presented here builds on two-level mori)hology\[Koskennienfi 1983\], extending it to achieve the desiredobjective.

contril)ution of this l)almr tnay \])e Slllll-marised as follows:With regards to the two-level model, we extend thismodel by allowing it to have multiI)le tapes on the lex-ical level and retaining the one tape on the surfacelevel; hence, 'multi-tape two-level morphology'.
Feasi-ble pairs in the standard two-level model become 'fea-sible tuple pairs' in our multi-tape model.With regards to the formalism, we have.
chosen atwodevel formalism and extended it to be al)le towrite multi-tape two-level grammars which involvenon-linear operations.
To achieve this, we made alllexieal expressions n-tuple regular expressions.
In ad-dition, we introduced the notion of 'ellipsis', which in-*Supported by a Benefitctor Studentship from SI+ Jo lm's Col-lege.

Nominal forms, such as / k i taab/  'book', were en-tered in the lexicon.
Vert)al forms were derived by a'lexicon component'.
A verb, such as /nkutib/ (form7), has the lexical entriesn E1 u El i Elwhere El is the alphabet of the root and E~ the al-phabet of the vocalism/affixes.
Tim lexicon compoventtakes the intersection of these two expressions and pro-duces/nkut ib / .
Now/nkut ib / i s  fed on the lcxical tapeof a standard two-level system wtfich takes care of con-ditional phonetic dmnges (assimilation, deletion, etc.
)and produces/'einkutib/, a A similar approach was usedby \[Lavie et al 1988\] for IIehrew using a 'pre-h!xicalcompiler'.\[Kay 1987\] proposed a finite-state aplnoacl~ usingfimr tapes for root, CV-skeleton, vowel melody andsurface, each having an indel)endent head, i.e.
the ma-chine can scan from one lexical tape without movingthe head on other lexieal tapes.
The absence of mo-tion is indicated by ad hoc notation coded in the lexicalstrings.\[Beesley 1991\], working on Arabic, impleme,ited atwo-level system with 'detours', where, according to\[Sproat 1992, p. 163-64\], detouring involves nmltipledictionaries being open at a time, one for roots and onefor templates with vowels pre-compiled (as in iIarris'description).Other non two-level models were proposed (thereis no place here for a review of ttmse works):\[Kornai 1991\] proposed a model for autosegmentall/honology using FSTs, where non-linear autoseg-mental representations are coded as linear strings.\[llird and Ellison 1992\] proposed a model llased onone-level phonology using FSA to model representa-tions and rules.
\[Wiel)e 1992\] pr(llmsed I,l(Jdellii,g au-tosegmental phonology using multi-tal/e FSTs, wheremitosegmental representations m'e coded in arrays.\[Puhnan and Hepi)le 1993\] prol)osed a formalism forbidirectional segmental phonological processing, andi)roposed using it for Arabic.
The next subsectionpresents the develoi)ment of this formalism.3.3  P rev ious  Formal i sms\[Black et  al.
1987\] pointed out ttmt previous two-levelrules (cf.
,~a.1) affect one character at a time and pro-posed a formalism wtfich maps tletween (equal ram>bered) sequences of surface and lexical characters ofthe form,SURF ~ LEXalnidal consonant clusters, CC, take a prosthetic /Pi/.A lexical s t r ing  maps l;o a sllrfaee sLring iff theycan be partitioned into pairs of lexical-sm'fi~ce, sub-sequences, wtmre each pair is licenced I)y a rule.\[l\].uessink 1989\] added explicit contexts and allowedunequal sequences.
\[Puhnan and IIepple 19931 (level-oiled the l'ormalism further, allowing feature-based rep-resentations interpreted via unification.The developed formalism is llased on the existence ofonly two levels of rel)resentation: sm'face and lexical.Two types of rules are provided:LSC - SuI~," - I1.SC --> LLC - LF:x - B.LCLSC - Sm~v - RSC c> LLC - LEX - RLCwhereLSC = h.'ft surfiu:e context~ IJll I,' --- Sl lrface fortnI/.SC - riKht ranface contextLLC = h'l't le.xical contextLI,:x = lexical formI{LC = right lexical conte.xtThe special symbol * indicates an empty context, whichis always satisfied.

extensions ment ioned is capable ofdo.scribing the whole range of Arabic stems.Why do we need storage in the automata?
It isknown that  ml automaton  with linito storage can borOl)laeed with a larger (me without storage (:t simt)le so-hd.i(m is i.o dui)licato l.he ma(:hino for each case); hence,18.qusing finite storage (especially with g _< 1 and a smallfinite set of I') does not give the machine extra l)ower.The reason for using storage is to minimise the munherof machines and states.With regards to the implementat ion,  first we imple-mented a small system in order to test the usage ofAFSTs in our model.
Once this was estat)lished, wemade a second implementat ion based on the work of\[Pulman and Hepple 1993\].
This iml)lementation dif-fers fi'om theirs as follows: Lexical expressions are n-tuples, i.e.
implemented as l ists-of-l ists instead of lists-of-characters.
A facility to check ellipsis in rules wasadded.
The lexicon consists of multii)le trees, one treeper tape.
Finally, a morphosyntact ic  pro:set was added.Wc conclude this paper by looking at the possil)ilityof using our model for toiml hmguages.7.1 Beyond SemiticThis approach may be capable of des(:rit)ing other typesof non-l inear morphology, though we have not yet lookedat a whole range, of examples.
The following may forma theoretical franmwork for a number of non-l inear phe-nomena.Consider sui)rasegmental morphology in tonal lan-guages.

{kpolo} ' return'  gives Ikpat , ) /(Low) , /kpS ls / (M id) , /kpb l6 / (Low- I l igh) ,  and/kp61S/(Iiigh) \[Nida 1949\].
This can be expressed with thestem nlorpheme.
