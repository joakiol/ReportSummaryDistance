H~ADING WITH A PURPOSEMichael LebowitzDepartment of Computer Science, Yale University1.
iNTRODUCTIONA newspaper story about terrorism, war, politics orfootball is not likely to be read in the same way as agothic novel, college catalog or physics textbook.Similarly, tne process used to understand a casualconversation is unlikely to be the same as the processof understanding a biology lecture or TV situationcomedy.
One of the primary differences amongst thesevarious types of comprehension is that the reader orlistener will nave different goals in each case.
Thereasons a person nan for reading, or the goals he haswhen engaging in conversation wlll nave a strong affecton what he pays attention to, how deeply the input isprocessed, and what information is incorporated intomemory.
The computer model of understanding describednere addresses the problem of using a reader's purposeto assist in natural language understanding.
Thisprogram, the Integrated Partial Parser (IPP) ~s designedto model the way people read newspaper stories in arobust, comprehensive, manner.
IPP nan a set ofinterests, much as a human reader does.
At the momentit concentrates on stories about International violenceand terrorism.IPP contrasts sharply wlth many other tecnniques whichhave been used in parslng.
Most models of languageprocessing have had no purpose in reading.
They pursueall inputs with the same dillgence and create the sametype of representation for all stories.
The keydifference in IPP is that it maps lexlcal input into ashigh a level representation as possible, therebyperforming the complete understanding process.
Otherapproaches have invariably first tried to create apreliminary representation, often a strictly syntacticparse tree, in preparation for real understandlng.~ince high-level, semantic representations areultimately necessary for understanding,  there is noobvious need for creating a preliminary syntacticrepresentation, which can be a very difficult task.
Theisolation of the lexlcal level processing from morecomplete understanding processes makes it very difficultfor hlgn l eve l  predictions to influence l ow- leve lprocessing, which is crucial in IPP.One very popular  technique fo r  c reat ing  a low- leve lrepresentation of sentences has been the AugmentedTransition NetworX (ATN).
Parsers of this sort havebeen discussed by Woods \[ 11\] and Kaplan \[SJ.
AnATN-IiKe parser was developed by Winograd \ [10 \ ] .
MostATN parsers nave dea l t  primarily wltn syntax,occasionally checking a" few simple semantic propertiesof words.
A more recent parser wnicn does an isolatedsyntactic parse was created by Marcus \[4\].
TOeimportant thing to note about all of these parsers isthat they view syntactic parsing as a process to be doneprior to rea l  understanding.
Even thougn systems ofthis sort at times make use of semantic information,they are driven by syntax.
Their ~oal of developing asyntactic parse tree is not an explicit part of thepurpcse of human understanding.the type o f  understanding done by IPP i s  in some sense acompromise between the very detailed understanding ofThis work was supported in part by the Advanced Research8roJects A~enoy of the Department of Defense andmonitored under the Office of Naval Research undercontract N00014-75-C-1111.SAM Ill and P~M \[9\], both of which operated inconjunction with ELI, Riesbeck's parser \[SJ, and theskimming, h igh ly  top-down, style of FRUMP \[2\].
EL1 wasa semantically driven parser which maps English languagesentences into the Conceptual Dependency \[6\]representations of their meanings, it made extensiveuse of the semantic properties of the words beingprocessed, but interacted only slightly with the rest ofthe understanding processes it was a part of.
it wouldpass o f f  a completed Conceptual Dependencyrepresentation of each sentence to SAM or PAM whichwould try to incorporate it into an overall storyrepresentation.
BOth these programs attempted tounderstand each sentence fully, SAM in terms of scripts,PAM in terms of plans and goals, before going onto thenext sentence.
(In \[~\] Scnank and Abelson describescripts, plans and goals.)
SAM and PAM model the waypeople might read a story i f  they were expecting adetalied test on it, or the way a textbook might beread.
?acn program's purpose was to get out of a storyevery piece of informatlon possible, fney treated eachpiece o f  every story as being equally important, ~ndrequiring total understanding.
Both of these programsare relatively fragile, requiring compiex dictionaryentries for every word they might en0ounter, as well asextensive Knowledge of the appropriate scripts andplans.FR?MP, in contrast to SAM and rAM, is a robust systemwhlcn attempts to extract the amount of information froma newspaper story which a person gets when ne skimsrapidly.
It does this by selecting a script torepresent the story and then trying to fill in thevarious slots which are important to understand thestory.
Its purpose is simply to obtain enoughinformation from a story to produce a meaningfulsummary.
FRUMP i s  s t rong ly  top-down, and wor r ies  aboutincoming information from the story only insofar ~s ithelps fill In the details of the script which itse lec ted .
50 wn i le  FRUMP i s  robust ,  s imply sk ipp ingover words it doesn't Know, it does miss interestingsections of stories which are  not explained by itsinitial selection of a script.18P attempts to model the way people normal ly  read anewspaper s to ry .
Unl ike SAM and PAH, i t  does not careif it gets every last plece of information out of astory.
Dull, mundane information is gladly ignored.But, In contrast with FRUMP, it does not want to missinteresting parts of stories simply because tney do notmesh with initial expectations.
It tries to create arepresentation which captures the important aspects ofeach story, but also tries to minimize extensive,unnecessary processing which does not contrlbute to theunderstanding of the story.Thus IFP 's  purpose i s  to decide wnat par ts  o f  a s to ry ,i f  any, are in teres t ing  ( in  IPP's  case, that  meansre la ted  to te r ror i sm) ,  and incorporate  the appropr ia tein fo rmat ion  in to  i t s  memory.
The concepts used todetermine what i s  in teres t ing  are an extens ion  o f  ideaspresented by SctmnK \ [7 \ ] .2.
How l~  EOA~sThe u l t imate  purpose o f  reading a newspaper s to ry  i s  toi ncorporate  new in format ion  in to  memory.
In order  to doth i s ,  a number o f  d i f fe rent  Kinds o f  Knowledge areneeded.
The understander must Know the meanings o fwords, llngulatic rules about now words combine intosentences, the conventions used in writing newspaper5gs tor ies ,  and, c ruc ia l l y ,  have extens ive  knowledge aboutthe " rea l  wor ld . "
I t  is  impossible to proper lyunderstand a s tory  without  applying already ex is t ingknowledge about the funct ion ing o f  the world.
Thismeans the use of  long-term memory cannot be f ru i t fu l l yseparated  from other  aspects  o f  the  natura lunders tand in~ problem.
The mana~emant o f  a l l  th i sin fo rmat ion  by an unders tander  i s  a c r i t i ca l  problem Incomprehens ion,  s ince  the  app l i ca t ion  o f  a l l  potent ia l l yre levant  Knowledge a l l  the t ime, would ser ious ly  degradethe understandin~ process, possibly to the point ofha l t ing  I t  a l together .
In our model of  unders tand ing ,the ro le  played by the in teres ts  of the understander Isto a l low deta i led  processing to occur only on the partsof the s tory  which are Important to overa l lunderstanding, thereby conserving processing resources.Cent ra l  to any unders tand in~ system i s  the type ofKnowledge s t ruc ture  used to represent s to r ies .
At thepresent time, IPP represents stories in terms of scriptssimilar to ,  a l though simpler than, those used by SAM andFRUMP.
Most of the co--on events In I PP ' s  area ofI n te res t ,  te r ro r i sm,  such as hi Jaokings,  kidnappings,and ambushes, are reasonanly stereotyped,  although notnecessarily wltn a l l  the temporal sequencing present inthe scripts SAM uses.
ZPP also represents some eventsd i rec t ly  In Conceptual Dependency.
The representat ionsin IPP cons ist  of  two types of  s t ruc tures .
There arethe event s t ruc tures  themselves, genera l ly  sc r ip ts  suchas $KIDNAP and SAMBUSH, which form the backbone of  thes tory  representat ions ,  and tokens which f i l l  the ro lesin the event structures.
These tokens are basically the?
tc ture  Producers o f  \ [6 \ ] ,  and represent the conceptsunderly ing words such as "a i r l iner , "  "machine-gun" and"Kidnapper."
The f ina l  s to ry  representat ion  can alsoInclude l inks  between event s t ruc tures  ind icat ingcausal ,  temporal and scr ipt -scene re la t ionsh ips .Due to IPP's l im i ted  reper to i re  o f  s t ruc tures  wi th whichto represent events,  i t  is  cur rent ly  unable to fu l l yunderstand some s tor ies  which maXe sense only in  termso f  goals and plans, or other  higher leve lrepresentat ions .
However, the understanding techniquesused in IPP should be applicable to s tor ies  whichrequ i re  the use of  such knowledge s t ruc tures .
This i s  atop ic  o f  current  research.It Is worth noting that the form of a story'srepresentation may depend on the purpose behind itsbeing read.
I f  the reader is  only mi ld ly  In teres ted  inthe subject o f  the s to ry ,  sor ip ta l  representat ion  maywel l  be adequate.
On the other  hand, fo r  an s tory  o fgreat in teres t  to the reader,  add i t iona l  e f fo r t  may beexpended to a l low the goals and plans o f  the actors  Inthe s tory  to be gorked out .
This I s  genera l ly  morecomplex than simply represent ing a story in terms ofs te reotyp ica l  knowledge,  and wi l l  only be a t tempted  incases of great interest.In order to achieve i t s  purpose, ~PP does extens ive"top-down" processing.
That Is, It makes predlotionsaOout what i t  i s  l i ke ly  to  see.
These pred ic t ions  rangefrom low- leve l ,  syntact i c  p red ic t ions  ( " the  next nounphrase w i l l  be the person kidnapped," fo r  instance) toqui te  h igh- leve l ,  g lobal  p red ic t ions ,  ("expect  to seedemands made by the te r ror i s t " ) .
S ign i f i cant ly ,  theprogram only  makes pred ic t ions  about th ings  i t  wouldl i ke  to Know.
I t  doesn't  mind skipping over unimportantparts  of  the text .The top-down pred ic t ions  made by IPP are implemented interms o f  requests,  s imi la r  to those used by RiesbecK\[5\], which are basically Just test-action pairs.
Whilesuch an implementation In theory allows arbitrarycomputat ions  to ~e per formed,  the  ac t ions  used in  IPPare in fact quite limited.
IPP requests can build anevent s t ruc ture ,  l ink  event s t ructures  together ,  use atoken to f i l l  a ro le  in  an event  s t ruc ture ,  ac t ivate  newrequests  or de-act ivate  other act ive  requests.The tests in IPP requests are also llmited in nature.They can look for certain types of events or tokens,check fo r  words with a spec i f ied  property in the i rd ic t ionary  ent ry ,  or  even check for spec i f i c  lex ica li tems.
The tes ts  fo r  lex ica l  i tems are  qu i te  Impor tantin  Keeping IPP ' s  p rocess ing  e f f i c ient .
One advantage  i sthat  very  spec i f i c  top-down pred ic t ions  w i l l  o f ten  a l lowan otherwise very complex word d isa~biguat ion process tobe bypassed.
For example, in a s tory  about a h i jack ing ,ZPP expects the word "car ry ing"  to i nd icate  that  thepassengers  o f  the  h i jacked  veh ic le  a re  to fo l low.
So i tnever  has to cons ider  An any deta i l  the  meaning o f"car ry ing . "
Many funct ion  words rea l ly  nave no meaningby themselves, and the type o f  p red ic t ive  processingused by IPP is  c ruc ia l  in handling them e f f i c ient ly .Despite i t s  top-down or ientat ion ,  IPP does not ignoreunexpected Input .
Rather, If the new Information isi n te res t ing  in i t se l f  the program wi l l  concentrate oni t ,  makin~ new pred ic t ions  In add i t ion  to ,  or insteado f ,  the or ig ina l  ones.
The proper in tegrat ion  o ftop-down and bottom-up processing al lows the program tobe e f f i c ient ,  and yet not miss in teres t ing ,  unexpectedin format ion .The bottom-up process in~ of  IPP i s  based around au lass i f i ca t ion  o f  words that  i s  done s t r i c t ly  on thebasis of  processing considerations.
IPP Is interestedin the traditional syntactic classifications only whenthey help determine how worqs should be processed.IPP's c r i te r ia  fo r  c lass i f i ca t ion  Involve the type ofdata  s t ruc tures  words bu i ld ,  and when they shou ld  beprocessed.Words can bu i ld  e i ther  o f  the  main data  s t ruc tures  usedin XPP, events  and tokens .
The words bu l ld in~ eventsare  usua l ly  verbs ,  but many syntact i c  nouns,  such as?
k idnapping,"  " r io t , "  and "demonstrat ion" a lso ind icateevents, and are handled in Just the same way ast rad i t iona l  verbs .
Some words,  such as  =oat ad jec t ivesand adverbs ,  do not bu i ld  s t ruc tures  but ra ther  modi fys t ruc tures  bu i l t  by other  words.
These words arehandled accord ing  to the  type o f  s t ruc ture  they modi fy .The second c r i te r ia  fo r  c lass i fy ing  words - when theyshould be processed - is  c ruc ia l  to 1PP's operat ion .
Inorder to model a rap id ,  normal ly paced reader,  IPPattempts to avoid doin~ any processing which w i l l  notadd to i t s  overa l l  understandin~ o f  a s to ry .
To doth i s ,  i t  c lass i f ies  words in to  three groups - wordswhich must be fu l l y  processed i - -ed la te ly ,  words whichshould be saved in shor t - te r~ memory, and then processedla ter ,  i f  ne,=essary, and words which should be skippedent i re ly .Words which must be processed immediately includein teres t ing  words bu i ld ing e i ther  event s t ruc tures  ortokens.
"Gunmen," "kidnapped" and "exploded" aretyp ica l  examples.
These words give us the overa l lframework o f  a s to ry ,  ind icate  how much e f fo r t  should 0edevoted to fu r ther  ana lys is ,  and, most impor tant ly ,generate the pred ic t ions  w~loh a l low la ter  processing toproceed efficiently.The save and process la ter  words are those which maybecome s i~n i f ioant  la ter ,  but are not obvious lyimpor~cant when they are read.
This c lass is  qu i tesubstant ia l ,  Inc luding many du l l  nouns and near ly  a l lad jec t ives  and adverbs .
Zn a noun phrase  sucn as"numerous I ta l ian  gunmen," there I s  no po in t  inprocessing tO any depth "numerous" or " I ta l ian"  unt i l  we~now the word they modify is Important enou~n to beincluded in the f ina l  representat ion .
Zn the caseswhere fu r ther  procesein~ is  necessary, IPP has theproper in format ion  to eas i ly  incorporate the saved wordsIn to  the s tory  representat ion ,  and In the many cases60where the word is not important, no effort above savingthe word is required.
The processin~ strategy for thesewords is a Key to modei~n~ nom,al reading.The final class of words are those IPP skips altogether.Thls class includes very unlnterestln~ words whlchneither cont r ibute  processing clues, nor add to thestory representation.
Many function words, adjectivesand verbs irrelevant to the domain at hand, and mostpronouns fa l l  into this category.
These words can stillbe significant in cases where they are predlcted, butotherwise they are ignored by IPP and take no processln~effort.In addition to the processing techniques mentioned sofar, IPP makes use of several very pragmatic heuristics.These are particularly important in processlng noun~roups properly.
An example of the type of heuristicused is IPP's assumption that the first actor in a storytends to be important, and is worth extra processingeffort.
Other heurlst~cs can be seen in the example Insection ~.
IP~'s basic strategy is to make reasonableguesses about the appropriate representation as qulcKlyas possible, facilitating later processln~ and f i xthings later if its ~uesses are prove to be wrong.~.

In humans this presumably occurs after areader has noted that  stories i nvo lv ing  gunmen tend tobe interesting.
Since it is interesting, IPP fullyprocesses GUNMEN, Knowing that it Is important to itspurpose of extracting the significant content of thestory, it builds a token to represent the GUNMEN andmakes several predlctlons to facilitate laterprocessing.
There is a strong possibility that someverb conceptually equivalent to "shoot" will appear.There are also a set of scripts, i nc lud ing  SROBBERY,STERRORISM and $HIJACK wnlcn are likely to appear, soIPP creates predictions looking for clues indicatingthat one of these scripts sOould be activated and usedto represent the story.FIRING : Word satisfies predictionPred ic t ion  conf i rmed - SHOOTING-WILL-OCCURIns tant ia ted  $SHOOT script61Predictions ?

Other senses of the word, such as "terminateemployment" are never considered.
Once IPP hasconfirmed an event, it builds a structure to representi t ,  in this case the $SHOOr script and the token forGUNMEN is f i l l ed  in ss the actor.
Predictions are madetrying to flnd the unknown roles of the scr ipt,  VICTIM,in particular, the reason for the shooting, and anyscenes of $SHOOT wnicn might be found.J J J i J J J J J i J i J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J l J J J J J J J J J J J J Jinstantiated $ATTACK-P~RSON scriptPredictions - SAT rACK-PERSON-ROLE-FINDER.SATrACK-PERSON-SC~N~SIm,*|i@m|li,I@Wm~#mI~@Igm#wIiII#mmimmIII|@milIIillJgimR@IPP does not consider the $SHOOT script to be a totalexplanation of a snootin~ event.
It requires arepresentation wnlcn indicates the purpose of thevarious actors, in the absence of any otherinformation, IPP assu~es people wno shoot  aredeliberately attacKin~ someone.
So the SATTACK-PERSONscript is Inferred, and $SHOOT attacned to i t  as ascene.
The SATTACK-PERSON representation allows IPP tomake inferences which are relevant to any case of aperson being attacked, not just snootin~s.
IPP is stillnot able to Instantiate any of the high level scriptspredicted by GUNMEN, since the SATTACK-PERSON script isassociated with several of the~.FROM : Function wordPredictions - FILL-FROM-SLOTJ i * J i J J e J ** J J J J i J J J J J J J l J J J J J J J J J * J J J J * J J J J * * J * J J J J J * J * JFROM in s =ontext such as this normally indicates thelocation from which the attack was made is to follow, soIPP makes a prediction to that effect.
However, since aword building a token does not follow, the prediction isdeactivated.

it is an activity w~Ich can beconstrued as a terrorist act).
This causes thepred ic t ion  made by GUNMEN that  $TERRORISM was a poss ib lescript tO be trlggerred.
Even if AMBUSH had othermeanings, or could be associated with other higher levelscripts, the prediction would enable quicK, accurateidentification and incorporation of the word's meaninginto the story representation.
IPP's purpose ofassociating the shooting with a nlgh level Knowledgestructure which helps to expialn it, has been achieved.At this po int  in the processing an Instance ofSTERRORISM is constructed to serve as the top levelrepresentation of  the story.

Notice that  1PP has jumped to aconclusion about the story,, which, while plausible,could easily be wrong, it assumes that the actor of theSBOMB and SATTACK-PLACE scripts is the same as the actorof the STERRORISM script, which was in turn inferredfrom the actor of the sbootln~ incident.

For instance, asmentioned earlier, the first actor mentioned has astronz tendency to be important to the understandln~ ofa story.
In thls story that means that the modlfyin~prepositional phrase "of former President Su~enlo KjellLau~erud" is analyzed and attached to the token builtfor "son," usua l ly  not an interesting word.
Heur~stlcsof this sort ~ive IPP its power and robustness, ratherthan any single rule about language understandln~.5.
CONCLUSIONIPP has been implemented on a DECsystem 20/50 at Yale.It currently has a vocabulary of more than I~00 wordswnlcn is oelng continually Increased in an attempt tomake the program an expert underst~der  of newspaperstories scout terrorism.
?t is also planned to addinformation about nigher l eve l  knowledge structures suchas ~oals and plans and expand IPP 's  domain o f  interest.To date, IPP has successfully processed over 50 storiestaken directly from various newspapers, many sightunseen.The difference between the powers of IPP and thesyntactlcally driven parsers mentioned earller can centbe seen by the Kinds o f  sentences they  hand le .Syntax-0ased parsers  genera l ly  deal w i th  re la t ive lys imple ,  syntact i ca l ly  we l l - fo rmed sentences .
IPPhandles sucn sentences, Out also accurately processesstories taken directly from newspapers, which of teninvo lve  ext remely  convo lu ted  syntax ,  and in many casesare not  grammatical  at  a l l .
Sentences o f  th i s  type  aredifficult, if not impossible for parsers relyln~ onsyntax.
IPP is so le  to process news stories quickly, onthe order of 2 CPU seconds, and when done, it hasachieved a complete understandln~ of the story, not Justa syntactic parse.As shown in tne examples above, interest can provide apurpose for reading newspaper stories.
In othersituations, other factors might provide the purpose.But the purpose is never simply to create arepresentation - especially a representation with nosemantic content, such as a syntax tree.
This is not tosay syntax is not important, obviously in manycircumstances it provides crucial information, but itshould not drive the understanding process.
Preliminaryrepresentations are needed only if they assist in thereader's ultimate purpose bulldln~ an appropriate,high-level representation which can be incorporated withalready existing Knowledge.
The results achieved by IPPindicate that parsing directly into high-level knowledgestructures is possible, and in many situations may wellbe more practical than first doin~ a low-level parse.Its integrated approacn allows IPP to make use of allthe various kinds of knowledge which people use whenunders tandtn~ a story.References\ [1 \ ]  Cullin&ford, R.
