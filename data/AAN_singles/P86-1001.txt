TUTORIAL  ABSTRACTSIntroduction to Computational LinguisticsRalph Grishman, New York UniversityThis tutorial provides a general overview of computationallinguistics.
Topics to be considered include the componentsof a natural language processing system; syntax analysis(including context-free grammars, augmented context-freegrammars, grammatical constraints, and sources of syntacticambiguity); semantic analysis (including meaning represen-tation, semantic constraints, quantifier analysis); and dis-course analysis (identifying implicit information, establishingtext coherence, frames, and scripts).
Examples will be drawnfrom various application areas, including database interfaceand text analysis.Natural Language GenerationKathleen McKeown, Columbia UniversityIn this tutorial, we will begin by identifying the types of deci-sions involved in language generation and how they differfrom problems in the interpretation of natural language.Several techniques that have been used for "surface" genera-tion (i.e., determining the syntactic structure and vocabularyof the generated text) will be examined, including grammars,dictionaries, and templates.
From there, we will move on toother problems in language generation, including how thesystem can decide what to say in a given situation and howit can order the information for inclusion in a text.
Here wewill study the constraints that have been used for these deci-sions in domains such as expert systems, database systems,scene description, and problem solving.
We will also look atthe interaction between conceptual decisions such as theseand decisions in surface generation, considering approachesthat propose an integrated solution.Structuring the LexiconRobert Ingria, BBN Laboratories IncorporatedThis tutorial will discuss the information that has beenstored in the lexicon.
It will first deal with the types of in-formation that have typically been placed in lexical entries,detailing what sorts of lexical information is necessary fornatural language systems.
The format of lexical entries andthe relationships between lexical entries will be considerednext (as in cases of irregularly inflected forms, such "go","went", "gone", abbreviations and acronyms, such as "helo"and "helicopter", and derived forms, such as "destroy" and"destruction").
Alternate places for storing information willalso be considered (for example, regular morphological infor-mation might be contained in individual exical er~tries or inthe grammar).
The tutorial will conclude with the implica-tions of recent work in linguistic theory for the structure oflexicons for computational purposes.Recent Developments In Syntactic Theory and TheirComputational ImportAnthony S. Kroch, University of PennsylvaniaSyntactic frameworks currently under development in linguis-tics take different perspectives on several issues of computa-tional interest.
Among these are: (1) the importance of stat-ing linguistic theories in a well-defined and explicit formalismwhose mathematical properties are known or investigable; (2)the degree to which the syntatic properties of sentences canbe understood independently of their semantic interpretation;and (3) the extent to which empirical and mathematicalresults on parsing and generation can illuminate linguisticissues.
We shall discuss the perspectives on these and relatedquestions held by various current linguistic theories, includinggeneralized phrase structure grammar (GPSG), governmentbinding theory (GB), lexical-functional grammar (LFG), andtree adjoining grammar (TAG).Current Approaches to Natural Language SemanticsGraeme Hirst, University of TorontoThis tutorial provides a survey of various computational ap-proaches to semantics--the process of determining the mean-ing of a sentence or other utterance.
Issues addressed willinclude definitions of meaning; the differences between lin-guistic theories of semantics and formalisms uitable for com-putational understanding of language; knowledge represen-tations that suitable for representing linguistic meaning; therelationship between semantic processing and syntactic pars-ing; and factors in choosing a semantic formalism for a par-ticular computational pplication.
The approaches to seman-tics that will be discussed will include procedural semantics,conceptual dependency, Montague semantics, and composi-tional and knowledge-based approaches.Machine TranslationSergei Nirenburg, Colgate UniversityThis tutorial will address the recent resurgence of interest inmachine translation (MT) in the United States, Europe, andJapan.
Topics to be discussed include the variety of objec-tives for MT systems; various research and developmentsmethodologies; MT as an application area for theoretical lin-guistics, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence;environments for MT research; and selected case studies ofresearch projects.
