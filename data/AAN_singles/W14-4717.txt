Chinese language teachers often face challenges in findingan effective way to teach classifiers, as the rules for defining which nouns can be associated withwhich classifiers are not straightforward.
Many theoretical studies have explored the nature ofChinese classifiers, but few studies take an empirical approach to the investigation of effectiveteaching and learning methods of classifiers.
Learners often find that existing dictionaries eitherdo not have classifiers as lexical entries, or give very brief explanations that are hardly helpful.This paper presents the progress of an ongoing project on the construction of an e-dictionary ofChinese classifiers.
The objective of the project is to provide a platform for Chinese languagelearners to explore and learn classifier uses in a bottom-up fashion.
The current work is on thedesign of an e-learning tool database and its connection to the e-dictionary database.
Descriptionsof the design and the functions of the e-learning tool are provided in the paper.1 IntroductionAs a classifier language, Chinese does not provide a way for its speakers to avoid using classifiers.
Thatis, they are a compulsory grammatical element in a phrase structure.
The basic construction of a classifierphrase has a numeral (e.g., y??
?one?, sh??
?ten?
), or a determiner (e.g., zh`e ?this?, n`a ?that?
), or a qualifier(e.g., j?i ?several?, m?ei ?each?
), placed before a classifier and a noun after it.
Thus, a simple Englishnoun phrase such as ?a book?
needs to be expressed in Chinese with the classifier b?en in between thenumeral y??
and the noun, ?book?
as y?
?b?en sh?u.
In brief, a classifier is a word or morpheme that is used toclassify nouns based on their inherent semantic features.
However, the semantics and the uses of Chineseclassifiers have become far more complex than their syntactic structure looks.
It is hard to define theirlexical meanings and their uses seem to have rules to follow but violations are common.
It is impossiblefor learners to make a correct choice of a classifier if they simply follow its grammatical rules.
This ismainly because Chinese classifiers contain information about the features of the noun referents they canbe associated with.
However, most of the classifiers can be associated with a number of different typesof nouns.
Their noun-dependent meanings are inexplicit and ambigous.
Conventional dictionaries givebrief definitions of classifiers, which is a way to avoid complicated descriptions and lengthy listing oftheir associated nouns, but are of little help to language learners.Classifiers can be divided into different types based on their semantic functions.
Some of them carrythe unique features of the Chinese language; others are representational of classifier languages, and yetall of them have the functions of measure words.
Regarding the differences between classifiers and mea-sure words, Tai & Wang (1990) stated that ?A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out somesalient perceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associatedwith entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity ofthe entity named by a noun?.
This definition makes a clear distinction between a classifier and a measureword from a multi-dimensional perspective.

There is an ontological base on which classifiers and nouns are associated with (Sowa,2000; Huang and Ahrens, 2003; Philpot et al., 2003; Nichols et al., 2005), while measure word associ-ations with nouns could be simply based on the notion of quantification.
Understanding the differencesbetween the two concepts can help learners of Chinese increase their awareness of the semantic andcognitive bases of classifier associations with nouns (Gao, 2010; Gao, 2011; Quek and Gao, 2011).Due to the complexity of classifiers?
functions, different definitions and classifications have beenfound.
Some researchers define Chinese classifiers based on their grammatical functions.
For exam-ple, Chao (1968) divided classifiers into nine categories.
They are ?classifiers or individual measures?,?classifiers associated with v-o?, ?group measures?, ?partitive measures?, ?container measures?, ?tempo-rary measures?, ?standard measures?, ?quasi-measures or autonomous measures?, and ?measures for verbsof action?.
His classification shows that he did not distinguish between classifiers and measure words.The advantages of such a classification are that it includes all the types of classifiers mentioned above andthat classifiers?
measuring function is emphasized.
But a big disadvantage is that the embedded mean-ings of the specific noun classifiers and the ontological nature of the noun referents that classifiers areassociated with are largely ignored.
This way of classification may help beginning learners to understandthe basic functions of Chinese classifiers, but will not help more advanced learners.Yue (2009) took a different approach.
He treated classifiers and measure words as quantifiers anddivided those collected from corpus data into eleven categories based on the kinds of nouns the quanti-fiers are associated with.
They were defined as quantifiers ?representing a group of people?, ?indicatinggroups of animals?, ?representing types?, ?representing individual thing or person?, ?representing a pair?,?representing a set?, ?representing a huge amount of things?, ?representing a slight amount of things?,?representing capacity?, ?representing weather?, and ?representing emotions?.
Regardless of the unnec-essary new term he used to refer to classifiers, his classification is more cognitively based and closer tolanguage learners?
knowledge of noun referents and their categories.Using computer technology to apply empirical research findings of classifier knowledge to natural lan-guage processing (NLP) has provided a new approach for the semantic analysis of classifiers (Nirenburgand Raskin, 2004; Hwang et al., 2008) and for computer-assisted language learning (Guo and Zhong,2005).
However, no e-learning systems developed so far have been found to be able to help languagelearners to use the semantic features of classifiers?
associated nouns to learn classifiers systematically.Yet, the emergence of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has made it possible for languagelearners to explore various kinds of user-friendly and flexible e-learning tools (Davies, 2011).
CALLincorporates technology into the language learning process and also applies itself across a broad spec-trum of teaching styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson and Haggstrom, 2006).
Its bidirectional andindividualized features make it possible for learners to use it effectively to improve different aspects oflanguage skills (Mallon, 2006; Chang et al., 2008).The idea of designing an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL.
Findings fromempirical studies on classifier learning provide a practical guideline in the process of the designing.
Inorder to make the e-dictionary a useful learning tool for both beginning and advanced learners of Chi-nese, measure words and classifiers are both labelled as classifiers.
However, in the feature descriptionslearners can understand and identify the functions of the words categorically.Currently the dictionary database includes 859 classifiers collected from dictionaries and other re-sources.
The number of associated nouns classified is currently 6420.
Different tables (as sub-databases)are set up according to the classifications of classifiers and the nouns included.
In addition to the con-ventional functions of a dictionary built up for the e-dictionary of classifiers, an e-learning system isimplemented to allow learners at different levels to have a self-paced exploration of the relationshipsbetween a classifier and a noun or many nouns from different categories.
In this paper the focus will beon the descriptions of the designs of the e-learning database and its interface.2 Classifier-based Classification of Noun CategoriesClassifiers must be used together with nouns to form classifier phrases but their associations with nounsare not contextually based nor are they of a free choice.
The mapping can be complicated.
A classifier127can be associated with a number of nouns from different categories and a noun can be mapped to morethan one classifiers.
For example, the classifier ti?ao enters into nine noun categories and the noun ch?e?car?can be associated with li`ang and t?ai as well.
Learners may quickly feel intimidated when at a first trialto identify the possibilities of the multi associations.
Therefore, in designing the database, instead ofmapping classifiers to nouns directly, we make use of classifiers?
noun-dependent features to first identifyall the nouns that each classifier can be associated with and then classify the nouns into categories.So far eleven noun categories have been identified and classified as ?nature?, ?humans & body parts?,?animals?, ?vegetables & fruits?, ?man-made objects?, ?buildings?, ?clothing?, ?food?,?furniture?, ?tools?,and ?vehicles?.
A hierarchy of noun classifiers is built up according to the number of noun categorieseach classifier is associated with.
These noun categories are not word classes defined with the principlesin lexicology.
They are defined based on the ontological categories of the noun referents of real-worldentities, which are supposedly directly linked to learners?
understanding of nouns and their referents ofthe language.
Grouping classifiers?
associated nouns into categories based on the ontological categoriesof noun referents is one of the special features of the design of this dictionary.The classifiers are set in a hierarchical order in the database according to the number of noun categoriesthey enter into.
The highest number of noun categories that a classifier has been identified as beingassociable with more than one noun categories is nine.
Of all the classifiers in the database, about morethan 50% of them are associated with more than three noun categories.
The fewer noun categories aclassifier is associated with, the easier it is assumed to be for learners to grasp.
For example, the classifierli`ang occurs only in the category of vehicles, (e.g., car, lorry, bicycle, etc.).
Learners generally do notconfuse or misuse it for other types of nouns.
Due to the differences in the mult-categorical associations,some classifiers are more commonly used than others.
The nineteen classifiers listed in Table 1 are theones that are associated with at least three noun categories and they are the most commonly used ones aswell.In the analysis of linguistic categories, a cognitive approach defines categories by groups of featuresand relationships within certain linguistic domains.
The occurrence of a noun with a particular classi-fier in a phrase structure is dependent upon the categorical features of both the noun and the classifier.However, the embedded semantic networks of the categories are not obviously well connected, which ismainly due to the diachronic and sociolinguistic changes of the Chinese language.
As a result, nativespeakers?
categorization dependent on not only noun referents?
intrinsic properties but also their func-tional and human perceptual ones.
In other words, classifier and noun associations encode as well humancognitive understandings of the real world entities.
The use of classifiers has thus been found changedover time.
More noun and classifier associations are found to be possible cross-categorically.
That is, onesingle classifier can associate itself with a number of nouns from different noun categories and similarly,one single noun can also be associated with not one but two or three classifiers.
This cross-categorizationextension complicates the classification of classifiers to a great extent.Theoretically, it does not seem to be possible for linguists to build a meta-theory for a systematicorganization of logically transparent classifier-noun categories and thus hard for lexicographers to findan effective way to illustrate the semantic relationships between classifiers and nouns.
The main obsta-cle in classifier acquisition seem to be due to the fact that the the nature of the semantic meanings ofclassifiers is opaque.
The complex classifier associations with nouns have consequently caused nouncategorizations to be linguistically unconventional.128Classifierin Chi-neseClassifierin PinyinNumber of noun categories theclassifier is associated withExamples of nouns the classifier isassociated with?

Each role in the table is a sub-database inthe system.129Studies show that native speakers of Chinese tend to take a cognitively-based bottom-up approach as astrategy to the learning of classifiers while second language learners of Chinese tend to take a top-downapproach but often find their learning outcome inefficient (Soh and Gao, 2009; Gao, 2010; Quek and Gao,2011).
The cognitive approach taken for the design of the database is based on the findings of empiricalstudies on Chinese classifier learning by adults and children of both native and non-native speakers ofChinese.
The classifier-based classifications of noun categories that reflect the ontological knowledge ofthis category of linguistic terms and its structure are assumed to be able to activate learners?
cognitiveprocesses when exploring the pragmatic use of classifiers.3 Noun-based Semantic Features of Classifiers DecomposedTable 1 is an illustration of the contents of the main database for the e-dictionary.
Each role in the tableis a sub-database in the system.Table 1 is a demonstration of the semantic features of some most commonly used noun classifiersand their associated nouns.
Through semantic decomposition of the noun-based classifier features, thecognitive mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns are revealed.
Take the classifier ti?ao forexample (see Figure 1).
It is associated with nouns such as rainbow, leg, snake, cucumber, road, scarf,potato chip, boat and necklace, which are from nine of the eleven noun categories listed in Section 2.Despite of the different categories they belong to, the nine nouns share one same property ?
the shapeof the noun referents that is defined as ?longitudinal?.
This shows that the classifier ti?ao is inhabited withthis semantic feature and it is possibly the cognitive basis on which native speakers of Chinese associateit with the related noun referents accordingly.Similarly, the classifier g?en is used with the nouns such as stick, bone, banana, pillar, sausage, needle,and ribbon that belong to seven noun categories respectively.
These nouns possess the same ?longitudi-nal?
feature as ti?ao does.
This means that extracting one same feature from g?en and ti?ao is not helpfulenough for learners to understand the differences between the two classifiers though classifying nounsinto ontological categories can constrain the interference to learners to a certain extent.
What needs tobe further specified is to define each noun with a unique feature of its own, no matter whether it is fromits lexical semantic meanings, pragmatic functions, or human perceptions.
For example, in addition tothe feature labelled as ?longitudinal?, ?for supporting walking?
is added as a feature to ?stick?, ?a pieceof human skeleton?
to ?bone?, ?turning from green to yellow when ripe?
to ?banana?, ?one end stuck tothe ground?
to ?pillar?.
More specifications are needed until finally each noun is distinguished from othernouns that are associated with one same classifier.
These definitions are the core part of the database inthe e-learning tool system linked to the e-dictionary.4 Methodology4.1 Application of Cognitive Strategies in Noun Classifier AcquisitionIn this section we describe an approach that is used for extending the design of the e-dictionary to that ofan e-learning tool as another part of the project.
Developed first in the software environment of FileMakerPro 8.5 (see Figure 2), the dictionary is established on a database system.
Categorical records created asdata files are used to store the associated nouns.
The records created so far include eleven categories ofnouns as are described in Section 2.
Such a categorization appears explicit, but its top-down approachfails to reveal the feature-based mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns.
The objective ofthe e-learning approach, on the other hand, is to guide users to search for correct classifier and noun pairsby looking for the defined features of the noun referents, firstly from those broadly defined as ?animacy?,?shape?, ?size?, ?thickness?, ?length?, and ?function?
to those specific ones extracted from each particularnoun referent.With such a bottom-up approach, the e-dictionary allows users to learn to use the particularly inter-related features of a classifier and its associated noun referents in a case-by-case fashion.
In this waylearners can better understand the point that a classifier reflects the cognitive classification of its asso-ciated noun referents.
Each individual record thus contains both general and specific information of aclassifier and its associated nouns as data entries, The features decomposed from the noun referents are130Figure 1: Mapping among the tiers of classifiers, nouns, and defined features.defined and recorded as independent data entries linked to the e-learning tool.
For example, if a learnerwants to know which classifier is the correct one for ?boat?, he or she can enter the word ?boat?, findits category as ?vehicles?, and choose its shape as ?longitudinal?.
Then ti?ao should automatically popup in this case because ?boat?
is the only noun referent from the ?vehicles?
category (see Table 2).
Inother cases where there are two or more noun referents that are featured as ?longitudinal?, the user willbe guided to look for a more specific or unique feature with a few more clicks on the users?
interface.The e-learning environment in the dictionary also provides users the classifier phrases that are com-monly used but they may not be easy for learners to acquire.
Take the classifier zh??
for example.
It isassociated with noun referents that belong to ?animals and body-parts?, and ?man-made objects?, such as?bird?, ?hand?, and ?pen?.
The unique perceptual features of these noun referents are identified and builtinto the e-learning system so that users can click different categories on the interface to make particularassociations as long as they have some general knowledge of the noun referents in terms of functions andperceptual features.CL inCharacterCL inPinyinAssociatednounsin ChineseAssociatednounsin EnglishAssociated noun categories Shape?

Compared with other database systems, MySQL is relatively more reliableand easier to use, especially for the design of web applications.
MySQL database can also be handled andmanaged using tools like phpMyAdmin.
Figure 2 is a display of the database in the web environment.Data in MySQL are stored in different tables and every unit in each table can be referred to by itsrow and column index.
This feature makes online search convenient and applicable to the design of webapplication.As shown in Figure 2, there are six tables that have been created in the database.
In table ?main?, dataare sorted by classifiers.
Basically, this table contains all of the information in a conventional dictionarythat takes classifiers as lexical entries.
This table is mainly used for searching classifiers for a nounor searching nouns for a classifier.
Users can conduct their search for nouns using both Chinese andEnglish.
Search in Chinese has been designed to allow input either in Chinese characters or in Pinyin forboth classifiers and nouns.
The definition of a classifier, its associated nouns in Chinese and English, andthe categories that its associated nouns belong to can all be searched categorically.
The search outcomeis then presented in a result page.In table ?byshape?, data are sorted by the shapes of noun referents such as ?longitudinal?, ?rectangular?,and ?round?.
In the other tables specific features of noun referents that have been so far defined are sortedrespectively by size, quality of material, and ontological categories.
In these tables, not every noun intable ?main?
is included, as some nouns cannot be described using these features.
For example, the word?customer?
cannot be described under the feature of shape, but it is classified into the category of human.Hence, it exists in table?bycategory?
but not in the?byshape?
one.The database is designed in such a way so as to increase the efficiency of the search function in theweb application.
The idea of implementing this searching function is to add in the conditions one by oneso as to narrow down the search field.
For example, ?hair?
is in the category of ?human & body parts?with features ?longitudinal?, ?thin?
and ?soft?.
Users can conduct the following step-by-step search:1.
Search in table ?bycategory?
to find all the nouns in the category of ?human & body parts?.
Callthem Group 1.2.
Search nouns with shape ?longitudinal?
and in Group 1 in table ?byshape?.
Call them Group 2.3.
Search in table ?bysize?
for the nouns with the condition ?thin?
and in Group 2.
Call them Group 3.132(a) Input page.
(b) Drop-down list search page.Figure 3: The web application user interface.4.
Search in table?bymaterial?, for the nouns with the condition ?soft?.At Step 4 when the condition ?soft?
is chosen, users should be left with the only noun ?hair?.
As thesizes of Groups 1, 2 and 3 become smaller, the search time is reduced.
If more features are added, thenthe steps of search can be repeated until the target noun is found.4.3 Design of the Web Application InterfaceThe web application interface is designed using PHP, a server-side scripting language.
Basically, it is adynamic web page connected to the MySQL database built up for this purpose.
It means that the contentof this web application depends on the database and what is submitted to the server.
On the client side orthe web application interface for users, as shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b, HTML language is appliedto build up the basic structure as well as the presentation of the website.The method used in the design of the web application interface make the e-learning tool instructiveand self-exploratory.
Once a user clicks one of the three links on the side bar, he or she will be directedto a webpage shown in Figure 3a or Figure 3b, where the search function is contained in an HTML133form.
With HTML form attribute ?action?, data will be submitted to a specific page, that is, the php scriptcontaining that search function.Inside the respective php script, there will be several common command lines:@ $db = new mysqli(?localhost?, ?root?, ?
?, ?ureca?
);$db->set_charset("utf8");if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {echo ?Error: Could not connect to database.?
;echo ?Please try again later.?
;exit; }These commands are to connect to and set the character set of the database built up for this purpose.Here utf8 is used as there are both English and Chinese characters in the database.
On these three webpages, forms are submitted using the ?post?
method.
POST method sends form-data as HTTP (HypertextTransfer Protocol) post transaction and has no limitations on the size of data.
However, restrictions mayexist due to the nature of the database.
Search results will then be grouped and displayed, with searchablewords hyperlinked.
Here the method used is GET, which works better for non-secure data with a limitedsize.This web application interface enables learners to discover a noun classifier in three types of search,?searching a noun for its classifier(s)?, ?searching a classifier for its associated noun(s)?, and ?searchingclassifiers for a group of nouns by restricting one or more conditions?.?
Search type 1: Searching a noun for its classifier(s).This function is similar to any other online dictionaries.
Learners insert a noun to do a simple anddirect search.
On the result page learners can see which classifier or classifiers can be applied to thenoun and the definitions of the classifier(s).
This is an early design for the e-dictionary.
An exampleof the steps is given in Figure 3b.?
Search type 2: searching a classifier for its associated noun(s).This function is for learners to start their search with a classifier.
It is assumed that learners hadlearnt a classifier but had not known yet what nouns could be used with the classifier.
The searchresult is shown on a new page that includes the definition of the classifier and its associated nouns.The difference between search types 1 and 2 is that with search type 1 the result is simple and direct.Learners can understand right away how to form a classifier phrase with the result given.
The result ofsearch type 2, however, can display all the nouns that a single classifier can be associated with.
Learnersof Chinese at the beginning stage may feel intimidated seeing the result showing more nouns than theyexpect as they may not have learned yet why these different nouns are all related to each other.?
Search type 3: searching classifiers for a group of nouns by restricting one or more conditions.Instead of keeping all the conditions as the default in search types 1 and 2, learners can choose onecondition or more at a time from the drop-down lists.
The chosen lists allow the system to fetchdesired data directly from the databases.
Learners can delete any of the chosen conditions to starta new search and to compare the results.
This function is for more advanced learners who havelearned the general principles of classifier-noun associations and who have a clear target in theirsearch for a particular type of classifiers or nouns.Further search is also designed in the primary result page.
This function is currently shown as a hyper-link, which is dynamically generated and assigned with a value in advance.
The varieties of searchfunctions and illustrations are expected to eventually enhance learners?
understanding of the multi-dimensional noun-classifier associations.5 DiscussionWhat is presented in this paper is the progress of an on-going project on the building up of an e-learningtool for learning Chinese classifiers.
The aim of this project is to clarify the embedded relationships134between classifiers and their associated nouns so as to assist Chinese language learners in the acquisitionof classifier phrases.
At the first stage of the project, classifiers and their associated nouns were collectedfrom dictionaries and other resources.
A database for the e-dictionary part which contains the functionsthat are characteristic of conventional dictionaries was designed and set up.
Learners can search fora classifier or a noun for their association as a classifier phrase.
Then, a feature-based approach indesigning the classifier e-dictionary was extended to an e-learning environment created for learners toexplore.
At the current stage, the task is on the design and setting up of an e-learning system attached tothe e-dictionary.
As an experiment, MySQL was used to build up the database shared by the conventionaldictionary and the e-learning system.The structure of this database is formed in the way in which classifiers and nouns are stored in differenttables but can be linked together.
All the information stored in different tables was connected throughrespective grouping criteria which allow the data to be extended to the e-learning environemnt.
Onetable contains one type of information, such as classifiers in character, classifiers in pinyin, definitionsof classifiers, types of classifiers, classifier associated nouns in Chinese and English, categories of theassociated nouns, and semantic features of the nouns.
Every two tables share at least one commonparameter, which enables cross-table search as described in Section 4.2.
Such a design is able to boostthe efficiency of the search function.
In addition, the database can be enriched easily through MySQLcode or phpMyAdmin to import new data.A web application for self-learning in the e-learning environment was designed using PHP language.It serves as an e-learning tool for learning Chinese classifiers.
The various searching functions provideprogressive search for specified features of classifiers?
associated nouns and their classified categories.The feasibility of the functions of the e-learning tool and its web application need to be further im-proved.
Currently there are a few limitations.
For example, subjectivity is a limitation of this database.
Inthe process of decomposing nouns into respective semantic features, human cognition plays an importantrole.
However, this parameter varies from person to person.
Moreoever, speakers of Chinese in differentregions may tend to use different cognitive strategies in their associations with the semantic meanings ofclassifiers.
Therefore, data from experiments and empirical studies are needed for the future improve-ment of the semantic analysis and descriptions of the noun-classifier associations.
Another aspect toimprove is that regional featured uses of certain classifiers such as Singaporean Chinese speakers?
use ofl`?
with noun referents that are both big and small (e.g., ?watermelon?
and ?bean?)
can be explained andincluded in separate tables so that learners can be aware of the regional differences in classifier use.The advantages of the web application design are its multipurpose search functions and flexible linksto the various parts of the database behind.
With the various search functions, learners will be able toinvestigate classifiers from different aspects, which is ideal for self-learning.
On the page of ?Searchinga noun for its classifier(s)?, both Chinese and English entries are acceptable, which makes it easier forlearners to explore and make a flexible use of its learning functions.
However, on the page of ?Searchinga classifier for its associated noun(s)?, only Chinese character entries are available.
A future addition canbe made to allow entries by Pinyin as well.For the database development in the future, the web application is designed to be linked to the databasein a dynamical fashion.
Any changes made to the database can be reflected on the web page automati-cally.
This will also allow us to make further development without much of a change in the current layoutin the e-learning system.6 ConclusionBased on the Chinese classifier e-dictionary of (Gao, 2011), designed to help students learn the properuse of Chinese classifiers, this paper further explores the designs of the database and of an e-learningtool interface to better understand the association of classifiers and nouns.
In this experimental versionof the e-learning tool design, 859 classifiers and 6420 associated nouns were stored and classified indifferent tables according to the respective noun referents?
semantic features and prominent cognitivefeatures.
The system built-up with MySQL has shown its convenient linkage to database managementtool phpMyAdmin and web-design language PHP.
As the base of the e-learning tool, the database with an135interface built-in can be searched step by step with individual or combined functions.
The results can bedisplayed on the users?
webpage.
Learners can examine the property of a classifier and the link betweenthis classifier and its associated nouns from several perspectives via various search functions.
The multi-functional feature of this webpage is the design of the drop-down list search, which allows users todiscover classifiers?
noun-dependent features case by case.
To make use of the advantage of internet,further investigation of another feature within a search can be made possible through hyperlinked text.The final goal is to make the outcome of this project available online as learning resources for thegeneral public and as an e-learning tool for Chinese language learners.
Further development of thisproject and explorations of other possible database designs are necessary as our end goal is to providean effective learning tool.
Experimental studies are also needed to discriminate the subjectivity of thedescriptions of human congnition in the illustrations of classifier-noun associations.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank my research students Ong Shi Lun for the data entry, and Chen Jiaxing for her workon the database trials.ReferencesYu-Chia Chang, Jason S.
