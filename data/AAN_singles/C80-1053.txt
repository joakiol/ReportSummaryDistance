Abstract :TEXT ANALYSIS LEARAING STrATEGiESPierre PLANTEUniversit@ du Qu@bec ~ Montr@alAPLEC (l'APrenti-LECteur - or Lear-ning Reader) is an extension of the D@-redec software, a programming system de-voted to the content analysis and lin-guistic treatment of texts.APLEC will associate automaticallyto any text descriptive grammar (TDG -Grammaire descriptive de texte) a ques-tion/answer module where the questionsare asked in a given natural languageby the user, and where the a~wers aretracked down in the textual corpus un-dergoing examination.The user's TDGs can inscribe them-selves at various levels of analysis(morphological, syntactical, semantical,logical, ...), and it is a singularcharacteristic of the D@redec that itallows for a polyvalent treatment with-out interfaces, this being done withonly one retentive structure for theinformation, and only one algorithmicstructure for the description and forthe retrieval.Once the user's TDG is applied onthe question (it was at first appliedon the whole of the text), some explo-ration models (provided by the user)activate the comparison of the questionto the text in order to initiate thetracking down of the answer.If, due to weaknesses of the gram-mar, APLEC cannot bring to an end thiswork, it will track down relevant ele-ments of the problem lifted up, commu-nicate with the user, submit to him theresults of its analysis, and wait forhim to propose a solution to the pro-blem.
If there is such a solution, itwill be further on 'learned' by APLEC,that is it will be generalized on thewhole text in such a way as APLEC willno more intervene if similar problemsarise again.Hence, the intelligence of the ana-lysis grows gradually as the work ofthe interactions between the user andhis text, via the automaton, goes on;and it shall construct itself by osmosisto the particular semantics of the textundergoing questioning.We do not pretend to supply anachieved theory of automatic learning,but rather try to supply differentformal strategies functioning whateverthe content of the D@redec grammarsapplied to a given text.I will first describe the general charac-teristics of the D@redec programming sys-tem, and afterwards will pass on to a fewexamples of utilization of the questionmodule named APLEC.The D@redec offers to its userstwo large classes of functions: (i)functions said to be text descriptive,and (ii) text ex~lorative ~unctions.The first functions have the formof finished state automata.
They aremachines that scan the text sequenceafter sequence (e.g.
sentences), andthat build tree structures onto the ele-ments of these sequences (e.g.
words).The knots of the trees are labelled withdescriptive categories, and are also,eventually, linked together by orientedrelations.
The leaves of the trees(the words of the sequences) can seethemselves adjoined with complex seman-tic networks.Example :C A T * ~SUBJECT* / OBJEC?GSGThe user will program his D@redecautomata in such a way as they can la-bel descriptive structures to every se-quences of his text.The D@redec remains indifferent to--354--the nature of these structures whichhence can inscribe themselves at syntac-ticalp morphological ~ 'semantical t or lo-gical level~.The D@redec automata scan the se-quences in both directions.
They arenon deterministic, but all degrees ofdeterminism are programmable.
These au-tomata are preferentially ascending ra-ther than descending.
It is to be notedalso that their sensitivity to contextcan run over the frame of every analysedsequence and spread out on the whole ofa corpus.
Actually, any decision takenin a D@redec automata (may it be of ca-tegorization, composition of a phrase,the labelling of a relation between twoknots, the construction or developingof a semantic network...) can be tribut-ary to the result of an investigationcarried out in that part of the corpuspreceding or following the pointed se-quence, or even in any other corpus.This type of enlarged contextual inves-tigation enables a D@redec definition ofproperly textual recursive grammars inaddition to the definition of sententialrecursive grammars.The tree structures (named EXFAD -Expressions de forme admissible, or Ex-pressions of admissible form) will beassociated to the corpus sequences in anevolved interactive mode.
Here the D@re-dec software can give assistance to itsusers in many ways: first, it will auto-matically track down and give him a diag-nosis of programming errors; it also al-low him to trace the behavior of an auto-maton; it further allows interruptionsin the automata's work in order to ques-tion the state of the description, tomodify the grammar, etc.The text descriptions (TD - Descrip-tion de textes) produced by automatawill be analyzed further on by explora-tive functions whose arguments (calledexploration models), given by the user,are pattern-matching structures havinga simple writing syntax and a high dis-cernment power.
It is by way of the ex-plorative functions that the text des-criptive grammars (TDG, i.e.
the automa-ta series) will be associated to contentanalysis objectives.Thus the programming sessions withD@redec will usually have the aspect ofan enchainment whose links are:an  u omat   on   uct onthe obtaining of TDs by the applica-tion of these automata to the corpus;(3) the elaboration of exploration models;(&) the application of explorative func-tions on the TDs;(5) the analysis of the results event-ually followed by re-explorationsor by the reconstruction of newdescriptions.Programming with D@redec essentiallysignifies to program the production ofTDs, then to program their exploration,to analyze the results, and to start o-ver at one or the other stage until theobtaining of satisfying results.
Thewhole of the process is highly facilita-ted by the fact that the admissible ex-pressions, at the input like those atthe output - may they be for descriptivefunctions or for  explorative functions -have exactly the same writing syntaxfrom a computational point of view.One could think that such a typeof experimentation will be the lot ofmost of the software users.
But thehighly interested user will surely wantto enjoy the D~redec's ACSP procedures,i.e.
it's automatic context sensitiveprogramming procedures (proc@dures deprogrammation automatique sensibles aucontexte: PASC).These fuctions try in various waysto simulate the behavior of the program-mer in the control box of the followingdiagrams:i | 'nescriptivelresu l t s  n .1Programming of:~ ~Exp lorat ive functionControl b x TText i~--355--What is here aimed at is to take out ofthe programmer's hands as many as possi-ble of the real operations'to be made,and to leave him to take only certainhigh level decisions as per general pla-nif ication of the experiments.As for example, some of the ACSPsdeal with the chained reapplication ofexplorative functions on a TD; the re-sults that are obtained at every explo-ration will serve to modify the model(or models) of exploration that has(or have) been used, model (or models)which is (or are) given ~n a primaryversion by the user as a starting point.The user will control the ACSP by givingcertain keys, certain parameters thatwill guide the whole of the operations.Other ACSP allow for the progressi-ve enrichment of a TD by constantly mo-difying a descriptive apparatus whosegeneral structure is given at the start,here again accompanied by general para-meters dealing with the iterative process.It should be noted that the automa-tic programming procedures have, from acomputational point of view, the sameform or the same admissibi l i ty as theother D@redec functions or operations;it follows that the former are thus com-poundable with the latter.
This lastcharacteristic is the one that accountsfor the 'context sensitive' qualif icationof the ACSP: the automatic programmingprocedures are settled in environmentsthat are susceptible to supply the para-meters relevant to their execution.The ACSP machine which is by farthe most complex and, in a certain way,the most complete is named APLEC.APLEC (APrenti-LECteur - the Lear-ning Reader) will associate automatical-ly a question/answer module for all TDGsubmitted by the user.
This Q/A modulewhere the questions are formulated inthe natural language of the text, andwhere the answers are tracked down seg-ments of the latter.When APLEC cannot track down ananswer, it will:(i) give a diagnosis of the difficulty;(2) communicate with the user;(3) ask for a solution;(4) and - if a solution is proposed bythe user - try to generalize thesolution onto the overall corpus.All this is done in order to increaseit's forthcoming retrieval power, andto keep interruptions to a minimum.In addition to the grammar and toa few exploration models that he willconsider as being representative of thestructures labelled by it, the user willsupply APLEC with only very general pa-rameters as per the retrieval conditionsand the learning conditions.Here is a first example of a dialo-gue with APLEC:USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC :USER:APLEC :USER:APLEC :USER:APLEC :USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:Hello~Hello~ Would you like to givean opinion on the hunting of ba-by seals?
I will look throughmy data for an opposed opinion.Brigitte Bardot interests areless than honourable~It seems to me that we shouldpraise this defender of naturerather than to run him down bylending to his actions purelyselfish motives.Nevertheless Bardot is a verydecent lady~You are contradicting yourself;you were for it and now you areagainst it.
Are you in favor ofthis hunting, yes or no?No:Brigitte Bardot has just made afool of herself by her loony de-clarations on the hunting of ba-by seals.Give another opinion; I will nowlook for an agreeing argument.Weber acts to protect the cutelittle seals~Can you supply an equivalent ex-pression for the expression"seals" among the expressions:"wonder", "earth", "house"?
"Wonder"~Can you consider the expression"Weber" as an equivalent for"celebrity"?Yes~Other rich celebrities do nothingfor the protection of wonders ofthis earth which is the house ofall.Any other opinion?Brigitte Bardot comes to defendthe nice hunters~I think I discern a contradictionin the evaluative process of Fouropinion.
I cannot give an an-swer to it.Any other opinion?Thank you~Bye, byesIn that example, the analyzed textis made up of some twenty letters sentto newspapers while was taking place thedispute surrounding the hunting of babyseals in the St-Laurent estuary.
APLECwas then fed upon a French surface gram---356mar (PLANTE 1980), and a so-called dis-coursive evaluative grammar (gramma~@valuative du discours) (PANACCIO, 1979).The first grammar tracks down for allfrench sentences the topic and commentas well as various types of complementsand determinatives.
It also practicesa segmentation of the sentence in itssentential components.
The second gram-mar allows us to know if an agent or atypical act of a discursive formation(e.g.
here, the hunting of baby seals)is praiseworthy or condemnable, thisbeing done after a study of the evalua-tive transfers occurring on the markers"praiseworthy" or "condemnable" in thesentences.
These markers are at firstlabelled manually on certain words ofthe corpus (e.g.
"ridicule ": "condemna-ble").
The second grammar juxtaposesitself on the first.
(Both grammars aremore thoroughly expounded in PLANTE,198o.
)When APLEC cannot track down an an-swer directly in the text (either becau-se of a weakness of the grammar or be-cause of some textual insuff iciency onthe question), APLEC will intervene,i.e.
get in touch with the user, explainthe difficulty, and wait for a solution.If a solution is proposed, it will pro-bably facil itate the discovery of theprecise answer to the question; moreover,it will be, if the user wishes, generali-zed to the whole of the text undergoingexploration, thus it will help with thefuture tracking down of answers to otherquestions.Hence APLEC's performance, that isits capacity to supply adequate answersto given questions, improves itself gra-dually with the conversations allowed.Little by little, conceptual networksare constructed, allowing for a more andmore refined and acute analysis becauseof its being more and more relevant tothe explored text.
APLEC is in a waysold blank to its users who little bylittle will transform it into a morepersonal robot which gets better whileadapting to particular textual data.The solutions that are proposed du-ring the conversations and that are la-ter on generalized can take differentforms.
In our example, the solutionform lies in the supplying of "word-to-word" equivalence relations ("Weber"::"celebrity").
Yet APLEC can accept andgeneralized solution forms which are alot more complex.
Thus, for example,the short following text:John and Mary are at the bookshop.Mary would like to offer a book toJohn.But she lacks the money.Mary decides to slip the book un-der her coat.The bookshop owner will lose abook but John will be happy.USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:USER:APLEC:Did Mary steal?Make "offer' more explicit.HabituallyTwe offer an objectof valuesMake "slip" more explicit.It is an action~Make "steal" more explicit.It is an action on an object ofvalue.Mary decides to slip the bookunder her coat.Any other question?Thus APLEC learns that "book" isan object of value (since it is "offered"in the text), for it learned that to"slip" and "steal" can now be taken onefor the other, since that to "slip" hasbecome an "action" on an object of "va-lue"...In this second learning strategy,the "word-to-word" equivalences are re-placed by more or less complete pattern-matching semantic networks defined inthe terms of the experimented grammar andlabelled to the words of the question andto those of the text.
These networks,proposed only during interruptions, firstpermit a refinement to the pattern-mat-ching procedures to facil itate the track-ing down of the good answer, and second-ly permit the augmentation or the con-struction by themselves of new networks.In the last example, after the first ex-plicit reformulation, all the 'offeredobjects' in the text received the cate-gory "value".. .We will note that APLECauthorizes the contextualisation of thelearning procedures, i.e.
the circum-stantial general ization of the solutionsproposed by the user, this being donewith the help of different execution pa-rameters manipulated by the latter.We believe that APLEC formally al-lows the distinction of what is relevanti~ a semiotic enterprise to the semanticsof a group of texts, to the semantics ofa particular text, or rather to the se-mantics of a part icular use of a giventext.
It also allows the delimitationof the semantic boundaries of a givenTDG, and to thus make easier the amelio-ration of the latter.These last considerations lead usto reflect on the problems that are re-lated to the project of the edificationof a theory of natural language descrip---357-~tion, ands in particular, on the problemof the insertion of semantics in that the-ory.Natural languages are objects that,in an evident manner, strongly resist allknown formalization techniques.
We haveto get used to the idea of an object who-se rules can change according to the por-tion of it we are observing, and accor-ding to the use we are making of it.We can always think of particular seman-tics, functional for a given world; manyrobots have shown that it is possible tosimulate the functioning of a naturallanguage for a limited semantic world.These experiments are interesting in anillustrative way, but they miss the es-sential of what characterizes the normalbehavior of a speaker: his capacity topass from one semantics to another whileadapting, or even while transformingwhen needed the set of rules alreadyconstructed.
What we need is a softwarethat will constantly facilitate theconstruction of new sets of primitives,of new axioms, and of new rules of infe-rence, these elements being consideredas variables rather than constants.We are still a long way from perfec-ting a system that would simulate suchlearning procedures, still far away froma system where the semantics would be ina fairly good part balanced on the sideof the use and not on the side of theinternal construction principles.
Mean-while, local experiments of descriptionwill be valid only if they are accompa-gnied by their empirical adequation con-ditions.
From such a point of view, theD@redec wants itself to be a formal fra-mework for the comparison of differentfunctionality indices and of empiricaladequation indices of the descriptiverules.
But moreover, for a given set ofrules, it (and here I am thinking moreparticularly of APLEC) automatically willtrack down the sequences or the lexicalitems of the corpus the description ofwhich must be specifically enriched toelevate the empirical adequation index.The rules will not then be automaticallytransformed or modified, constituting avery close simulation of human speakingbehavior, but generalizations will never-theless be produced automatically in sucha way as to augment the scope of the so-lutions that are at that moment proposedby the user.i The explanations (making an expres-sion more explicit), i.e.
the solu-tions to APLEC's problems must berepresented in a formal language -contrarily to the questions that areasked and to the supplied answerswhich are both given in natural lan-guage (French, English...) - in thisexample, the explicit reformulationsare given in English in order to ma-ke the presentation easier.Bibliography:PANACCIO, ClaudePiANTE, Pierre"Des phoques et deshommes, autopsie d'und4bat id@ologique.
