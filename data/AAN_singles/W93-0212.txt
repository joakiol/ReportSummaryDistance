"Act promptly, make your god happy"" Representation andRhetorical Relations in Natural Language GenerationMargaret  N. Hund lebySchool of Eng ineer ing /UGue lphGue lph ,  Ontar io  N1G 1X6 CanadaTile Sumerian proverb in the title is invoked by Julian Jaynes (1976) as he documents the laboriousprocess of coming to consciousness.
This activity is the cognitive labor that enables us to arriveat a question about the precise relationship between two types of knowledge, or ask if "rhetoricalrelations \[are\] the realizations of intentions, or should .

be discarded as simply a misconstrualof intentions proper?"
It is the legacy of that arrival we are discussing when we raise issues aroundintentionality, and I do not think it is coincidental that the proverb quoted in Jaynes' investigationca.n be read in its English translation as being among the earliest evidence for a clMm of a mentalstate of intentionality: not only does the proverb denmnstrate that we possess a state of awarenessabout "how to live", it also presents that consciousness a the instilling of action coincident with thehaving of the mental state.
The "god" whispers to the other half of the bicameral brain; the abilityto act lodged there responds as to a direct physiological stinmlus.
What is not quite so obviousis that, as the presence of intention makes itself known, so do the effects of a necessary rhetoricalrelationship.
This paper takes the position that rhetorical knowledge is embedded in intentionalknowledge, and that the two can be said not merely to have a close relationship but to interactdemonstrably in a reflexive one.The difficulty of dealing with intention vis-a-vis rhetorical relations rests first in making the as-sumption that either or both exist and affect language use to greater or lesser degrees, as severalof the abstracts collected here debate.
Of rnore concern for this discussion, however, seems to bethe acknowledgement at least tacit in most of the papers that extending language constructs intolanguage construction involves multiple levels of implication and/or  complex interweavings of ele-ments.
In short, we are having the present discussion because this second requirement arises fromour dealing with language in use, mad not language as an object for analysis, as Sanders particularlypoints out.
Implicitly as well as explicitly we are assuming that our inquiries are about the operationof language, and cannot be answered by a simple system indicating unidirectional (non-recursive)coherence, nor in settling for a two-part classifieaton of text as information and persuasion.As a result, this contribution begins with an orientation toward language use as social action (Heap,1989b) and seeks to account for intentions/rhetorical re ations in natural language generation as amatter of both the multiple goals of discourse (Kinneavy, 1980) and dynamic character of languageuse-shown, for example, in Conversation Analysis (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, 1974)-ratherthan by description of linguistic objects.
A major concern, then, is to understand language-use-as-44discourse both in action and as action, highlighting its resulting "aboutness".
To begin to do so here,I will examine the ways in which the proverb, an artefact of a much earlier world in which thinkingand acting had not been declared separate ntities, is about the intentional state, and demonstratesan embedded rhetorical relationship which is also its agency of intentional action.First, let us accept a definition of "intentional" as being involved in cognitive activity based on wishesand desires and proceeding through "directions of fit" and "conditions of satisfaction" (Searle, 1983).Such mental being is at the core of this Sumerian wisdom.
The whisper of the god indicates havingthe desire to act, the thinking; the reception or hearing, the understanding, of that whisper showsthe direction of fit by yielding advice to do something, in this case to "act".
Thus, the proverbdemonstrates conditions of satisfaction rising both from the injunction to promptness and from theexpected out-come-"make your god happy".
Taking the proverb as a text of the intentional state,we can examine the function of the rhetorical relations tacit to the intentionality's existcnce as atext.For, puttiug forward claims about the function of rhetorical relations begins with a prior claim,that intentionality possesses representation i  itself.
To speak or write in relation to the intentionalstate is to deal in the representation of representation (Searle, 1983).
We must be extremely carefillwith the distinctions we make here, however.
It is highly tempting to see representation as onlya container for "stateness".
Both communication theory based on "encoding" concepts and casuallocation of speech acts as posterior to intention result in seeing language as somehow "representativeof", with sets of signa acting as carriers, sent from a cognitive site through a conduit called text(Frawley,1988).
But in this proverb, we have a topic of cognitive relations echoed exactly in theactivity of the rhetorical ones: the thinking, understanding and acting of text production-inventing,arranging, styling-are present as material relations of the thinking, understanding and acting presentas the substance of the proverb.
Formulating a statement on "how to live" is not a message relayedor translated, but an entry into an intentional state effected because there has been entry into anintentional state.
Entry is, quite simply, an action accompanied by a set of strategies for designingbehavior under material coaditions-making semantic hoices, applying the rules of syntax, choosiagformats and internal arrangements to create the objects we think of as documents and to render the"aboutness" we find in the rhetorical relations its text owns.The conclusion approaching through the line of reasoning I am taking meshes with Searle's ob-servation that the intentional state requires being able to be present as conditions (p. 23).
Theseconditions can take many forms-pronomenalization, juxtaposition, paralleling, arranging as a string,arranging as a block, turning into graphics.
Doing so has created what is usually identified as therelations of logic (Morrison, 1988) and customarily taken as the nature, and effect, of rhetoricalrelations.
But whether we identify them as expression, analysis, logic or any other category, consid-ering these relations as a matter of intentional representation requires that we see them as designfor action.
Making language choices and/or constructing a text is not a matter of realizing inten-tionality, but of intentionality's being present, under conditions.
Acts of design clean up "physicalmessiness" as a matter of releasing the tacit into the explicit (Dennett, 1988).
Intentionality andrhetorical relations hare a presence of active connection-thinking toward acting on the one hand,and acting toward thinking on the other.
Mutual support results, and also mutual dependence, orreflexiveness: each is the set of conditions of the other being present, in the world.And what, then, is the role of language?
Since language consists ofsigna, it nmst be a representation-at least in its semantic aspects-and, ia turn, provides representation f the representatioa through45ordering it as grammar and syntax.
But this is the aspect under which we study language-as-object,not language-in-use, and tend to treat parole with the set of analytic devices applicable to langue(Saussure, 1972).
They are not, however, interchangable phases of the character of language, andmixing them up tends to obviate the operation of language as a system of signs-that it providestile grounds of and claims for representation through which we, quite simply, accomplish knowingabout (Addis, 1989).
Thus, the formulation of intention and its presentation within tile contextof discourse (Iicap, 1989a) are both required to accomplish tile work of the first major phase oflanguage-in-use, its "aboutness", in which intention and rhetoric reflexively generating the contentof discourse.In addition, my own work with writing and speaking for scientific purposes has shown me thatintentional knowledge cannot be made fully to be present unless there is some accommodation formode of awareness: that is, what is represented is seldom of concern to the system of representing,but how to represent, he mode, is crucial for purposive communicaton.
That is, we cannot graft alanguage sys tern onto intentionality, but we can eml)loy its modality-iconic, indexical or symbolic(Frawley, 1988)-as the agency for discourse relations (Burke, 1962).
Taking into account he iconic,visual character of language used in engineeriag design as the evidence of its rhetoric means takinginto account he direction of fit as evidenced in the language condition under which intentional statesappear phenomenonally (MNH, 1992).
As Dennett notes, there is little evidence that the relationshipis syntactic (p.216), or even, I think, a "logical" one (MNH, 1991).
We tend to accept descriptionsfrom linguistic science-those emphasizing logical relations as fundamental to having meaning-justbecause syntax produces a phenomenon accounted logical (Morrison,1988) and seemingly consonantwith "arrangement", the rhetorical relation most literally, and thus obviously, acting to order theiuchoate.
More uscfifl is tile potential of Dennett's "economies" and other relational action thatintroduces at least, tile possibility of recursiveness, as germane to the conditions of this or thatintentionality, both necessary and reflexive to intentionality, and knowledge, being preseut at all.Works Consul tedAddis, Laird (1989) Natural Signs.
