DinuFaculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of BucharestCenter for Computational Linguistics, University of Bucharestalina.ciobanu@my.fmi.unibuc.ro,ldinu@fmi.unibuc.roAbstractIn this paper we propose a computationalmethod for determining the orthographicsimilarity between Romanian and relatedlanguages.
We account for etymons andcognates and we investigate not only thenumber of related words, but also theirforms, quantifying orthographic similari-ties.
The method we propose is adaptableto any language, as far as resources areavailable.1 IntroductionLanguage relatedness and language change acrossspace and time are two of the main questions of thehistorical and comparative linguistics (Rama andBorin, 2014).
Many comparative methods havebeen used to establish relationships between lan-guages, to determine language families and to re-construct their proto-languages (Durie and Ross,1996).
If grouping of languages in linguistic fam-ilies is generally accepted, the relationships be-tween languages belonging to the same family areperiodically investigated.
In spite of the fact thatlinguistic literature abounds in claims of classifi-cation of natural languages, the degrees of similar-ity between languages are far from being certain.In many situations, the similarity of natural lan-guages is a fairly vague notion, both linguists andnon-linguists having intuitions about which lan-guages are more similar to which others.
McMa-hon and McMahon (2003) and Rama and Borin(2014) note that the computational historical lin-guistics did not receive much attention until thebeginning of the 1990s, and argue for the necessityof development of quantitative and computationalmethods in this field.1.1 Related WorkAccording to Campbell (2003), the methods basedon comparisons of cognate lists and sound corre-spondences are the most popular approaches em-ployed for establishing relationships between lan-guages.
Barbanc?on et al.
(2013) emphasize the va-riety of computational methods used in this field,and state that the differences in datasets and ap-proaches cause difficulties in the evaluation of theresults regarding the reconstruction of the phylo-genetic tree of languages.
Linguistic phylogenyreconstruction proves especially useful in histor-ical and comparative linguistics, as it enables theanalysis of language evolution.
Ringe et al.
(2002)propose a computational method for evolutionarytree reconstruction based on a ?perfect phylogeny?algorithm; using a Bayesian phylogeographic ap-proach, Alekseyenko et al.
(2012), continuing thework of Atkinson et al.
(2005), model the expan-sion of the Indo-European language family andfind support for the hypothesis which places itshomeland in Anatolia; Atkinson and Gray (2006)analyze language divergence dates and argue forthe usage of computational phylogenetic meth-ods in the question of Indo-European age and ori-gins.
Using modified versions of Swadesh?s lists1,Dyen et al.
(1992) investigate the classification ofIndo-European languages by applying a lexicosta-tistical method.The similarity of languages is interesting notonly for historical and comparative linguistics,but for machine translation and language acqui-sition as well.
Scannell (2006) and Haji?c et al.
(2000) argue for the possibility of obtaining a bet-ter translation quality using simple methods forvery closely related languages.
Koppel and Ordan(2011) study the impact of the distance betweenlanguages on the translation product and concludethat it is directly correlated with the ability to dis-tinguish translations from a given source languagefrom non-translated text.
Some genetically re-lated languages are so similar to each other, that1http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/cmp/iedata.txt1047speakers of such languages are able to communi-cate without prior instruction (Gooskens, 2007).Gooskens et al.
(2008) analyze several phoneticand lexical predictors and their conclusion is thatlexical similarity can be seen as a predictor of lan-guage intelligibility.
The impact of language sim-ilarities in the process of second language acquisi-tion is argued by the contrastive analysis hypoth-esis, which claims that where similarities betweenthe first and the second language occur, the acqui-sition would be easier compared with the situationin which there were differences between the twolanguages (Benati and VanPatten, 2011).1.2 Our ApproachAlthough there are multiple aspects that are rele-vant in the study of language relatedness, such asthe orthographic, phonetic, syntactic and semanticdifferences, in this paper we focus only on the or-thographic similarity.
The orthographic approachrelies on the idea that sound changes leave tracesin the orthography, and alphabetic character cor-respondences represent, to a fairly large extent,sound correspondences (Delmestri and Cristianini,2010).In this paper we propose an orthographic simi-larity method focused on etymons (direct sourcesof the words in a foreign language) and cognates(words in different languages having the same ety-mology and a common ancestor).
In a broadly ac-cepted sense, the higher the similarity degree be-tween two languages, the closer they are.One of our motivations is that when people en-counter a language for the first time in writtenform, it is most likely that they can distinguish andindividualize words which resemble words fromtheir native language.
These words are proba-bly either inherited from their mother tongue (ety-mons), or have a common ancestor with the wordsin their language (cognates).Our first goal is, given a corpus C, to automat-ically detect etymons and cognates.
In Section 2we propose a dictionary-based approach to auto-matically extract related words, and a method forcomputing the orthographic similarity of naturallanguages.
Most of the traditional approaches inthis field focus either on etymology detection oron cognate identification, most of them reportingresults only on small sets of cognate pairs (usuallymanually determined lists of about 200 cognates,for which the cognate judgments are made by hu-man experts (Rama and Borin, 2014)).
Our ap-proach implies a detailed investigation which ac-counts not only for the number of related words,as it is usually done in lexicostatistics (where therelationships between languages are determinedbased on the percentage of related words), but alsofor their forms, quantifying orthographic similari-ties.
We employ three string similarity metrics fora finer-grained analysis, as related words in dif-ferent languages do not have identical forms andtheir partial similarity implies different degrees ofrecognition and comprehensibility.
For example,the Romanian word lun?a (moon) is closer to itsLatin etymon luna than the word b?atr?an (old) toits etymon veteranus, and the Romanian word v?ant(wind) is closer to its French cognate pair vent thanthe word castel (castle) to its cognate pair ch?ateau.In this paper we investigate the orthographicsimilarity between Romanian and related lan-guages.
Romanian is a Romance language, be-longing to the Italic branch of the Indo-Europeanlanguage family, and is of particular interest re-garding its geographic setting.
It is surroundedby Slavic languages and its relationship with thebig Romance kernel was difficult.
Besides gen-eral typological comparisons that can be madebetween any two or more languages, Romaniancan be studied based on comparisons of ge-netic and geographical nature, participating in nu-merous areally-based similarities that define theBalkan convergence area.
Joseph (1999) statesthat, regarding the genetic relationships, Roma-nian can be studied in the context of those lan-guages most closely related to it and that thewell-studied Romance languages enable compar-isons that might not be possible otherwise, withinless well-documented families of languages.
Theposition of Romanian within the Romance fam-ily is controversial (McMahon and McMahon,2003): either marginal or more integrated withinthe group, depending on the versions of the cog-nate lists that are used in the analysis.In Section 3.1 we apply our method on Roma-nian in different stages of its evolution, runningour experiments on high-volume corpora fromthree historical periods: the period approximatelybetween 1642 and 1743, the second half of 19thcentury (1870 - 1889), and the present period.
InSection 3.2 we make use of a fourth corpus, Eu-roparl, with a double goal: on the one hand, tocheck if degrees of similarity between Romanian1048and other languages in the present period are con-sistent across two different corpora, and on theother hand, to investigate whether there are dif-ferences between the overall degrees of similarityobtained for the entire corpus and those obtainedin various experiments at sentence level.
The con-clusions of our paper are outlined in Section 4.2 Methodology and AlgorithmIn this section we introduce a technique for deter-mining the orthographic similarity of languages.In order to obtain accurate results, we investigateboth etymons and cognates.
First, we automati-cally identify etymons and cognates, then we mea-sure the distances between related words, and fi-nally we compute the overall degrees of similaritybetween pairs of languages.
We also applied thismethod for investigating the mutual intelligibilityof the Romance languages, and preliminary resultsare presented in (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014b).2.1 Similarity MethodLet C  tw1, w2, ..., wNwordsu be a corpus in L1and letL2be a related language.
We assume, with-out any loss of generality, that the elements of Care ordered such that CL tw1, w2, ..., wNlinguauis the subset of C containing all the words thathave an etymon or a cognate pair in L2.

After a preprocessing phase, which is de-tailed in Subsection 2.2.1, we analyze words andbegin by identifying their etymologies.2.2.1 PreprocessingGiven a corpus C, we start by preprocessing thetext.Step 1.
Data Cleaning.
We perform basicword segmentation, using whitespace and punc-tuation marks as delimiters and we lower-case allwords.
We remove from the datasets tokens thatare irrelevant for our investigation, such as dates,numbers and non-textual annotations marked bynon-alphanumeric characters.Step 2.
Stop Words Removal.
We focus onanalyzing word content and, in order to obtainrelevant results, we remove stop words from thedatasets.
We use the lists of stop words for Roma-nian provided by the Apache Lucene2text searchengine library.
In Table 1 we list the total numberof stop words from each corpus.2http://lucene.apache.org1049Step 3.
Lemmatization.
We use lemmas foridentifying words?
definitions in dictionaries andfor computing adequate distances between wordsand their cognates or etymons.
We use the Dex-online3machine-readable dictionary to lemmatizeRomanian words.Step 4.
Diacritics Removal.
Many words haveundergone transformations by the augmentation oflanguage-specific diacritics when entering a newlanguage.
From an orthographic perspective, theresemblance of words is higher between wordswithout diacritics than between words with dia-critics.
For example, the orthographic distanceis higher for the Romanian word amicit?ie (friend-ship) and its French cognate pair amiti?e than fortheir corresponding forms without diacritics, am-icitie and amitie.
For this reason, in this stepof our procedure we create two versions of eachdataset, with and without diacritics, in order to fur-ther investigate the influence of the diacritics onthe cross-language orthographic similarity.
In Ro-manian, 5 diacritics are used today: ?a, ?
?, ?a, s?, t?.2.2.2 Relationships IdentificationStep 1.
Etymology Detection.
For most words,etymological dictionaries offer a unique etymol-ogy, but when more options are possible for ex-plaining a word?s etymology (there are wordswhose etymology was and remains difficult toascertain), dictionaries may provide multiple al-ternatives.
For example, the Romanian wordparlament (parliament) has a double etymology:French (with the etymon parlement) and Italian(with the etymon parlamento).
We account for allthe given etymological hypotheses, enabling ourmethod to provide more accurate results.For determining words?
etymologies we use theDexonline machine-readable dictionary, which isan aggregation of over 30 Romanian dictionaries.By parsing its definitions, we are able to automat-ically extract information regarding words?
ety-mologies and etymons.
The most frequently usedpattern is shown below.<abbr class="abbrev"title="limba language_name">language_abbreviation </abbr><b> origin_word </b>As an example, we provide below an excerptfrom a Dexonline entry which uses this pattern to3http://dexonline.rospecify the etymology of the Romanian word capi-tol (chapter), which has double etymology: Latin(with the etymon capitulum) and Italian (with theetymon capitolo).<b> CAP?ITOL </b><abbr class="abbrev"title="limba italiana"> it.
</abbr><b> capitolo </b><abbr class="abbrev"title="limba latina"> lat.
</abbr><b> capitulum </b>Step 2.
Cognate Identification.
Cognates arewords in different languages having the same ety-mology and a common ancestor.
The methods forcognate detection proposed so far are mostly basedon orthographic/phonetic and semantic similari-ties (Kondrak, 2001; Frunza et al., 2005), but theterm ?cognates?
is often used with a somewhat dif-ferent meaning, denoting words with high ortho-graphic/phonetic and cross-lingual meaning simi-larity, the condition of common etymology beingleft aside.

etymology.
We consider cog-nate candidates pairs formed of input words andtheir translations.
Using electronic dictionaries,we extract etymology-related information for thetranslated words.
To identify cognates, we com-pare, for each pair of candidates, the etymologiesand the etymons.
If they match, we identify thewords as being cognates.In our previous work (Ciobanu and Dinu,2014a) we applied this method on a Romanian dic-tionary, while here we extract cognates from Ro-manian corpora.
We identify cognate pairs be-tween Romanian and six other languages: Ital-ian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and En-glish.
We use electronic dictionaries4to extractetymology-related information and Google Trans-late5to translate Romanian words.
We are re-stricted in our investigation by the available re-sources, but we plan to extend our method toother related languages as well.
We selectedthese six languages for the following reason: thefirst four in our list are Romance languages, andour intuition is that there are numerous words inthese languages which share a common ancestorwith Romanian words.
We investigate the cog-nate pairs for Turkish because many French wordswere imported in both Romanian and Turkish inthe 19thcentury, and we believe that accountingfor Romanian-Turkish cognates would provide amore accurate result for the similarity of these lan-4Italian: http://www.sapere.it/sapere/dizionariFrench: http://www.cnrtl.frSpanish: http://lema.rae.es/draePortuguese: http://www.infopedia.pt/lingua-portuguesaTurkish: http://www.nisanyansozluk.comEnglish: http://www.collinsdictionary.com5http://translate.google.comguages.
As for English, we decided to investigatethe cognate pairs for this language in order to ana-lyze to what extent the influence of English on Ro-manian increases across time.
In Table 2 we reportthe number of Romanian words having an etymonor a cognate pair in the six related languages.Step 3.
Evaluation.
In order to evaluate our au-tomatic method for extracting etymology-relatedinformation and for detecting related words, weexcerpt a sample of 500 words for each of theconsidered languages (Romanian, French, Italian,Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English).
Thesamples are drawn using a proportionate stratifi-cation sampling method with regard to the lengthof the lemmas in our datasets.
We manually deter-mine the etymologies of the words in the samples,and we compare these results with the automati-cally obtained etymologies.
We compute the accu-racy for etymology extraction for each language,and we obtain the following results: 95.8% accu-racy for Romanian, 97.8% for Italian, 96.8% forFrench, 96.6% for Spanish, 97.0% for Portuguese,96.0% for Turkish and, finally, 97.2% for English.Language RelationshipCorpusParliament Eminescu Chronicles RVRFrenchcognates 192,275 13,074 3,139 43etymons 15,665,865 484,668 89,946 1,203Italiancognates 1,660,588 40,491 2,743 100etymons 9,234,710 348,948 77,633 957Spanishcognates 4,616,528 119,627 9,942 355etymons 4,411,707 212,106 65,336 482Portuguesecognates 4,378,354 115,309 15,755 324etymons 3,477,285 156,908 55,991 435Turkishcognates 1,401,569 33,070 2,332 113etymons 331,863 24,115 11,985 69Englishcognates 4,347,302 146,377 21,966 296etymons 625,596 17,328 6,799 56Table 2: Number of Romanian token words havingetymons or cognate pairs in related languages.2.2.3 Linguistic DistancesVarious approaches have been previously em-ployed for assessing the orthographic distanceor similarity between related words.
Their per-formance has been investigated and compared(Frunza et al., 2005; Rama and Borin, 2014), buta clear conclusion cannot be drawn with respect towhich method is the most appropriate for a giventask.
We employ three metrics to determine theorthographic similarity between related words.
InSubsection 3.1.2 we investigate to what extent thesimilarity scores computed with each of these met-rics differ, and whether the differences are statisti-cally significant.
We use the following metrics:1051?
LCSR: The longest common subsequenceratio (Melamed, 1995) is the longest commonsubsequence of two strings u and v dividedby the length of the longer string.
We sub-tract this value from 1, in order to obtain thedistance between two words.?
EDIT: The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1965)counts the minimum number of operations(insertion, deletion and substitution) requiredto transform one string into another.
We usea normalized version of the edit distance, di-viding it by the length of the longer string.?
RD: The rank distance (Dinu and Dinu,2005) is used to measure the similarity be-tween two ranked lists.
A ranking of a setof n objects can be represented as a permuta-tion of the integers 1, 2, ..., n. Let S be a setof ranking results, ?
P S. ?piq represents therank of object i in the ranking result ?.
Therank distance is computed as: RDp?, ?q ?ni1|?piq  ?piq|.
The ranks of the ele-ments are assigned from bottom up, i.e.
fromn to 1, using the Borda count method (deBorda, 1781).
The elements which do not oc-cur in any of the rankings receive the rank0.
To extend the rank distance to strings,we index each occurrence of a given lettera with ak, where k is the number of its pre-vious occurrences, and then apply the rankdistance on the new indexed strings, whichbecome rankings in this situation.
In orderto normalize it, we divide the rank distanceby the maximum possible distance betweentwo strings u and v (Dinu and Sgarro, 2006):?maxpu, vq  |u|p|u| 1q{2 |v|p|v| 1q{2.3 Experiments and ResultsIn this section we present the results obtained byapplying our method for determining orthographicsimilarity on Romanian datasets.To our knowledge, only basic lexicostatisticalmethods (generally based on different dictionar-ies or versions of the representative vocabularyof Romanian) which compute the percentage ofwords with a given etymology have been appliedfor determining the relationships between Roma-nian and related languages.
Because of the diffi-culty of setting the bounds between the basic lex-icon and the remaining words, Graur (1968) usesin his experiments three concentric versions of thebasic Romanian lexicon.
Dinu (1996) reevaluatesthe etymology detection for the three versions ofthe basic Romanian lexicon and reclassifies thelexical material.
He argues against grouping to-gether all the words with Slavic origins, withoutdifferentiation between Old Slavic and languagessuch as Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish.Sala (1988) builds a version of the representativevocabulary of Romanian comprising 2588 words,which we use in our experiments as well.3.1 Romanian EvolutionWe apply our similarity method on high-volumeRomanian corpora from three distinct historicalperiods of time, with different cultural, econom-ical, political and social contexts.
In Table 1 wereport statistics for these corpora and for the basicRomanian lexicon.3.1.1 DataThe first corpus consists of the transcription of theparliamentary debates held in the Romanian Par-liament from 1996 to 2007 (Grozea, 2012).
Thesecond corpus consists of the publishing works ofMihai Eminescu (Eminescu, 1980 1985), the lead-ing Romanian poet.
His works provide an insight-ful description of the period between 1870 and1889, with respect to its cultural, economical, so-cial and political aspects, including some majorevents in the Romanian history.
Many researchersconsider that Eminescu had a crucial influence onRomanian, his contribution to modern languagedevelopment being highly appreciated.
The thirdcorpus dates back to the period approximately be-tween 1642 and 1743, the beginning period of theRomanian writing.
Miron Costin, Grigore Ure-che and Ion Neculce are Romanian chroniclerswhose main works follow one another in creat-ing one of the most detailed and valuable descrip-tions of Moldavia in that period, ?Letopiset?ul T??ariiMoldovei?.
Along with them, Dimitrie Cantermircontributed to the early development of the Roma-nian writing, having written what is considered tobe the first attempt at a socio-political novel (?Isto-ria Ieroglific?a?, 1703-1705).
Their chronicles ac-count for social, cultural, economical and politicalevents with the purpose of recreating historical pe-riods of time.
We also use the basic Romanian lex-icon (Sala, 1988), abbreviated RVR, for our exper-iments.

In the D and ND columns we provide the average degreesof similarity for the datasets with and without diacritics.
For languages for which we determine cognatepairs (besides etymons), we report both versions of the results, before and after cognate identification.In the %words column we provide the percentage of words having an etymon or a cognate pair in eachlanguage.
The results are ordered according to the ranking of similarity for the corpus comprising theparliamentary debates after identifying cognates and with diacritics included.tions from over 30 dictionaries ranging from 1927to the present time and contains archaisms andobsolete words (which are marked accordingly);therefore, we are able to identify etymologies forwords in all used corpora.3.1.2 ResultsIn this subsection we present and analyze the mainresults drawn from our research.
In Table 3 welist the output of our method for each corpus, withand without diacritics6.
We report the similaritybetween Romanian and related languages, provid-ing the average value of the three metrics used.
Inthe %words column we provide, for each corpus,the percentage of words having an etymon or acognate pair in a given language (the typical mea-sure used in lexicostatistical comparison, i.e., the0 distance function).
The results for the Romaniandatasets are plotted in Figure 4 and Figure 5.Cognate Influence.
Table 3 and Figure 4present the gain obtained by cognate analysis.
Ac-counting for cognates leads to an increase of sim-ilarity between Romanian and Spanish and Por-tuguese with almost 300%, and between Roma-nian and Italian with almost 20%.
Another spec-tacular increase of closeness is for Turkish, whichdraws closer to Romanian with more than 500%6The complete ranking of similarity is available online athttp://nlp.unibuc.ro/resources/rosim.pdf.by using the cognate gain.
The degree of sim-ilarity is not given by the contribution of wordsinherited in Romanian from Turkish (about 1%),but by the pairs of shared cognates.
Both Ro-manian and Turkish borrowed words from Frenchmassively towards the end of the 19thcentury.Thus, most pairs of Romanian-Turkish cognateshave common French ancestors, and words in Ro-manian and Turkish which resemble are actuallyloans from the same French words.
We also noticea significant increase in similarity between Roma-nian and English in the modern period.
This in-crease is natural and probably arises for the simi-larity between English and most of the other lan-guages as well.
We notice that this increase isdue preponderantly to the cognate pairs.
Most ofthe Romanian-English cognates have a Romancecommon ancestor (78.4% Latin, 4.2% French,3.4% Italian), and 11.8% have a Greek commonancestor, counted at lemma level on the corpuscomprising the parliamentary debates.Romanian Evolution.
Some significant resultscan be observed in the evolution of Romanian: thedegrees of similarity between Romanian and allthe Romance languages has increased significantlyfrom the Chronicles period until today.
Besidesthem, German is the only language to which Ro-manian drew closer (a possible explanation mightbe the fact that, after the establishment of Germans1053French LatinItalianSpanishPortugueseEnglishProvencalGerman TurkishRussianCatalan GreekAlbanianBulgarianSlavicOldSlavicHungarianRuthenianSerbianSardinianlanguage05101520253035404550similarityParliamentEminescuChroniclesRVRFigure 4: Degrees of similarity for the Romanian datasets.
For French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,Turkish and English, the values obtained after the cognate identification phase are also plotted.in Banat and Transylvania, many German wordsentered the basic Romanian lexicon).
On the con-trary, the similarity between Romanian and almostall the Slavic languages decreased in the same pe-riod.
Russian is the only Slavic language whichpreserved its degree of similarity with Romanian(being, in the 2000s, the only Slavic languageamong the top 10 most closely related languageswith Romanian, on the ninth position, with a de-gree of similarity of less than 4%).

Iranian and Baltic have a degree of simi-larity of less than 0.5.pearance contributed to the decrease of the Slavicinfluence (Ghet?ie, 1978).
In fact, all Slavic in-fluences in the 2000s sum up to 8.9%, in con-trast with Latin influences, reaching 61.8%.
Greekis the only language which reaches its peak re-garding the similarity with Romanian in the 19thcentury (due to the brief Phanariot dominance inthe 19thcentury).
Therefore, Romanian preservedits Latin character all along, and the influence ofthe non-Latin languages on Romanian (overesti-mated in some works) was in fact not so signif-icant.
This fact supports Darwin?s theory (Dar-win, 1859), which states that the genealogy of lan-guages is consistent with the genealogy of the na-tions (analyzed based on DNA similarity).Orthographic Metrics.
In order to compare thesimilarity scores computed with the three metricsused, we conduct hypothesis tests (Sheskin, 2003)to determine whether the differences between theresults obtained with each metric are statisticallysignificant.
We extract a sample of 5,000 wordsand we compute the pairwise differences betweenthe similarity scores.
Using the R v3.1.0 softwareenvironment for statistical computing (R CoreTeam, 2014), we perform the one-way ANOVAF-test, with the null hypothesis H0: ?EDIT?LCSR ?RD(where ?
?is the mean of the val-1054ues computed with the ?
metric) and the alterna-tive hypothesis Ha: not all ?EDIT, ?LCSR, ?RDare equal.
Since the p-value of 2.88e-05 is muchsmaller than the 0.05 significance level, we havevery strong evidence to reject the null hypothesisthat the mean computed values for the three met-rics are all equal.
Further, we perform post-hoccomparisons applying pairwise t-tests with Bon-feronni correction for the p-value, in order to an-alyze the differences between the metrics.
Foreach pair of metrics, p !
0.05.
The differencesare statistically significant, but we notice that theyare small.
Applying a two-sampled t-test, we ob-tain a [0.012, 0.015] confidence interval for themean difference between EDIT and LCSR, [0.015,0.018] for EDIT and RD, and [0.001, 0.003] forRD and LCSR, at 95% confidence level.
More-over, computing Spearman?s rank correlation co-efficient for the rankings obtained by each metricfor each dataset, we observe a very high corre-lation between them (?
?
0.98 for each pair ofvariables).
Thus, we conclude that reporting theaverage of the three metrics is relevant for our ex-periments, as differences are small and do not in-fluence the ranking.3.2 Europarl ExperimentsWe continue our investigation regarding the sim-ilarity of natural languages with two additionalexperiments.
First, we want to see if degreesof similarity between Romanian and other lan-guages in the present period are consistent acrosstwo different corpora.
In the second experi-ment we are interested to see if there are differ-ences between the overall degrees of similarityobtained for the entire corpus (the bag-of-wordsmodel) and those obtained in various experimentsat sentence level.
Our main corpus is Europarl(Koehn, 2005).
More specifically, we use the por-tions larger than 2KB collected between 2007 and2011 from the Romanian subcorpus of Europarl.The corpus is tokenized and sentence-aligned in21 languages.
For preprocessing this corpus, wediscard all the transcribers?
descriptions of the par-liamentary sessions (such as ?The President in-terrupted the speaker?
or ?The session was sus-pended at 19:30 and resumed at 21:00?).Exp.
#1.
In a first step, we apply the methodol-ogy described in Section 2 on the entire Europarlcorpus for Romanian, using a bag-of-words modelfor the entire corpus, in which we account for theoverall frequencies of the words.
In this experi-ment, as in the previous ones, we cannot detectoutliers, i.e., sentences which are unbalanced re-garding the etymologies of the comprised words.For this reason, we conduct a second experimentwhich addresses this potential issue.Exp.
#2.
We determine sentence-level ortho-graphic similarity and we aggregate the results tocompute the average values for the related lan-guages.
In this second experiment, we apply themethodology described in Section 2 for each sen-tence in the Europarl corpus for Romanian.
Foreach sentence we obtain a ranking of related lan-guages and, in order to obtain a ranking of sim-ilarity for the entire corpus, we compute the av-erage degrees of similarity: for each related lan-guage, we sum up the degrees of similarity for allthe sentences and divide this value by the numberof sentences in the corpus.Exp.
#3.
Because the interpretation of statis-tics derived from datasets that include outliers maybe misleading, we compute the standard quartilesQ1, Q2 and Q3 (Sheskin, 2003) with regard to thelength of the sentences.
We use the interquartilerange IQR  Q3  Q1 to find outliers in thedata.
We consider outliers the observations thatfall below the lower fence LF = Q1  1.5pIQRqor above the upper fence UF = Q3   1.5pIQRq.We apply our methodology again only for the sen-tences having the length in the rLF,UF s range.Language Exp.

As a last experiment, for each languageL we consider as observations the degrees of sim-ilarity between Romanian and L, we discard out-liers and we compute the average value of the ob-servations inside the rLF,UF s range.
For eachlanguage, we determine the distribution of the sen-tences according to their similarity with the givenlanguage (the histograms for the top 5 languagesare presented in Figure 6).In Figure 7 we report the top 20 languages inthe ranking of similarity for Europarl, emphasiz-ing the gain obtained by identifying cognates.
InTable 4 we report the similarity scores for the top20 languages in the rankings of similarity for allthe 4 experiments: overall similarity for the entireEuroparl corpus (Exp.

#4, for languages whose degrees of similaritywith Romanian are of less than 10%).
We test thebag-of-words model on two corpora from the sameperiod (the Parliament corpus and Europarl ?
inExp.
#1) and we notice that the results are consis-tent across different corpora (0.98 Spearman?s ?
).The only significant difference is for Portuguese,which is closer to Romanian as measured on Eu-roparl than on the Parliament corpus.4 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper we proposed a computational methodfor determining cross-language orthographicsimilarity, with application on Romanian.
Weinvestigated etymons and cognates and we con-ducted a fine-grained analysis of the orthographicsimilarity between Romanian and related lan-guages.
Our results provide a new insight intothe classification and evolution of Romanian.
Weplan to apply our similarity method on a corpusof spoken language, and to extend our analysisto other languages as well, as we gain access toavailable resources.
We further intend to combineour orthographic approach with syntactic andsemantic evidence for a wider perspective onlanguage similarity.AcknowledgementsWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their help-ful and constructive comments.
