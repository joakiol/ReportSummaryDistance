eduI n t roduct ionIn this paper, we develop a new generative paradigmwith which to capture phonological generalizations.Our framework differs from standard generative frame-works inasmuch as we eschew all derivational analy-ses.
Thus, we dispense with procedural transforma-tions of underlying and intermediate representationsinto surface forms by means of the cyclic applicationof relatively unconstrained context-sensitive rewritingrules, lnstead, we adopt a strictly monostratal ap-proach, wherein a single level of articulatory representa-tion is subject o linguistic onstraints expressed eclar-atively using well-understood logical tools.In order for our enterprise to succeed, we will re-quire a rich representational system.
To this end, wefollow the lead of autosegmental and metrical phonol-ogy, taking our representations to be organized aroundnatural groupings of articulators.
A further similarityto autosegmental analyses and some traditional gener-ative analyses is that we allow underspecification in ourlexical rcpresentationsl But in contrast o these othertheories, we adopt a single, concrete, surface-based rep-resentational system, rather than abstract underlyingand intermediate representations of uncertain status.In particular, our approach is strictly monotonic, disal-lowing stages of analysis in which ill-formed representa-tions are constructed and repaired.
Instead, the linguis-tic constraints we impose, both universal and parochial,combined with possibly underspecified lexical represen-tat.ions, conspire to fully determine surface representa-tions.
The result is a fully declarative system, albeit onewhich can be provided with a procedural interpretationin which lexicai (syntactic and semantic) representa-tk)ns are incrementally refined into surface representa-tions, or vice-versa, by the application of constraints,citlmr sc~q,cntially or in parallel.Wc haw" chosen to employ feature structures for ourphonological rel)rcsentations, a natural candidate forcu,straiut-based linguistic theories.
Feature structuresprovide two mechanisms for constructing linguistic rep-resentations.
The first is a multiple inheritance hierar-chy of types, which allows the multi-dimensional classi-fication of structures.
The second mechanism is that offi~atures, whose values are themselves modeled by fea-t .re structures.Universal and parochial constraints, including lexi-cal representations, are expressed using attribute-valuelogic.
Expressions in our attribute-value logics are in-terpreted as restrictions on admissible linguistic struc-tures.
Being comprised of a representational system offeature structures ubject to a collection of attribute-wdue constraints, our grammars are interpreted in aco-inductive, constraint-based fashion.
More specifi-cally, the admissible linguistic structures are modeledby those feature structures atisfying all of the con-straints.
This contrasts with traditional, inductive orrule-based generative accounts, in which well-formedrepresentations are constructed from a primitive set ofwell-formed base cases by applying derivational rules.Unlike many approaches to phonology, ours includesa careful consideration ofthe morphology-phonology in-t~,rface.
It should be clear how our phonological the-ory can be integrated with a constraint-based theoryof morphology, and thus to constraint-based theories ofsyntax and semantics.
The result is a seamless theoryof language relating phonology and semantics, mediatedby morphology and syntax.
One benefit of constructingsuch a unified theory is that constraint resolution algo-rithms can integrate constraints from diverse linguisticsources on-line during processing, as the speech signal isbeing received.
An architecture supporting integratedprocessing is clearly desirable given the overwhelmingpsycholinguistic evidence concerning human processing.It is important to point out that our theory, being basedon logical constraints over monostratal representations,can easily integrate diverse sources of constraints simply1)y means of conjunction.
The constraints themselvescan be highly modular, both across components suchas syntax all(.\[ semantics, and within components suchas phonology.

particular language families.
Furthermore, subregu-larities within a language, which often stem from sep-arate, possibly historically unrelated sources, can alsobe captured, without the resource to default mecha-13nisms.
A further desirable feature of our monostratalconstraint-based approach is its declarative, relationalnature, which allows the same linguistic constraints tobe applied symmetr ical ly  to both generation alld un-derstanding.In what follows, we provide specifications of the mostimportant universal constraints involved in syllable andmetrical structure, with part icular constraints for En-glish syllabification, Malak-Malak and Yup'ik stress as-signment, and Icelandic umlauting.
For reasons ofspace, we are not able to include the full signatures(declarations of types) for these grammars, nor will wegive all of the constraints necessary to define such agrammar.
Readers interested in complete, implementedgrammars, including all of the signature entries andcollstraiuts, should consult (Mastroianni 1993).Feature  S t ructures  and  Const ra in tsFor linguistic representations, we adopt the featurestructure formalism of (Carpenter 1992), which wasmodeled on the notion of feature structure employedin tiPS(3 (Pol lard and Sag 1994).
Feature structures arebuilt out of two components, types and features.
Aspecification of the behavior of types and their corre-sponding features is known as a signature.A signature is built  out of a finite set Type oftypes.
We interpret types as sets of objects.
Touse a non-linguistic example, Nat might be the typeof natural  numbers, which is interpreted as the set{0, 1 .
.
.
.
, n, .
.
.}.
The types form a multiple inheritancehierarchy under a subtyping part ia l  ordering E .
If thetype o" is a subtype of a type v, then every object oftype a i s  of type r.  We write a _E r i f the  type v i sa subtype of o', and also say that cr is a supertypc of v.For instance, consonants, represented by the type consare subtypes of segments, represented by the type seg,so we write sea D_ cons.
Furthermore the type glide ofglides is a subtype of cons, so cons E glide.
Thus bythe transit ivity of part ial  orderings, glide is a subtypeof type sea, so seg D_ glide.
As an alternative xample,we have a type bool of boolean values, with the truthvalues + and - as subtypes, so bool E + and bool E -.\[f a ~ r, we also say that r is more specific than o-, orthat cr is more general than r. More specific typ(~s pro-vide more information about an object.
Using a typehierarchy allows us to both factor constraints on differ-ent classes of representations and to state them at theappropriate l vel of generalization.A type p is known as a unifier of the types o" and rif it is a subtype of both of them, so that a _E p andr E_ p, in which case cr and r are said to be unifiable.For instance, the types for approximants and conso-nants, approx and cons, are unifiable, as they have acommon subtype glide.
A pair of types is unifiable ifthe information they contain is consistent.
Thus thetypes + and - are not unifiable, as it is impossible foran object to be of both types.
Similarly, the typesnasal and obslruen!
have no unifiers, as there are nosegments which can be assigned to both types.
Oneway to view unification is as a type-theoretic analogueof conjunction.
For instance, glide has all of the infor-mation contained in the conjunction of approz and cons,plus perhaps some more.
A pair tr and r of unifiabletypes must have a most general unifier, cr tA r, such that0" _E o" IA r,  r E_ a I.J r and for every unitier p of tr andr, o" IA v E P. For instance, cons-approz, the type ofconsonant approximants, is the most general unifier ofcons and approx.
As another example, we use non-lowas the type of non-low heights, and non-high for thetype of non-high heights, and so we have the mediumheight, reed = non-high IA non-low, as their unification.We further define a most general or universal type, _k,with the property that,  for any type r ill our ordering,.l.
E r.To construct feature structures, we also need a fi-nite set Feat of features.
The remaining componentof a signature relates the features to the types bymeans of appropriateness conditions.
These deter-mine the features which can and must occur on eachtype, as well as constraining the types of their val-ues.
This is the sense in which we are dealing witha typed system, rather than simply a sorted one.An appropriateness assignment is a part ial  functionApprop: Feat x Type ~ Type.
A structure of type ais required to have a value for the feature f if and onlyif Approp(ff, a) is defined, and in addit ion, the valuemust be at least as specific as Approp(f, tr).
For in-stance, we have Approp(LABIAL, place) ---- bool, whichstates that the feature LABIAL, representing whetherthere is closure of the vocal tract at the lips, must re-ceive a boolean value in a feature structure representingthe place of articulation.
To take another example, wehave Approp(NUCLEUS, syllable) = vowel, l which statesthat the value of a syllable's nucleus feature must bea vowel.
In addition, Approp(MELODY, vowel) is unde-fined, which indicates that vowels do not receive melodyvalues.We require the appropriateimss assignment .o re-spect the inheritance hierarchy according to standardobject-oriented principles.
In particular, subtypes in-herit the features and value restrictions of all of theirsupertypes, which can be arranged in a mult iple inher-itance hierarchy.
In such a system, we require that ifa E r and Approp(f, a) is defined, then Approp(f, r)is defined and Approp(f,u) C Approp(f,r).
For in-stance, sonorants inherit the melody feature from con-sonants, and heavy-open-syllables inherit the nucleusfeature from syllables, but further constrain it to be a1For simplicity, we ignore the case of languages whichallow non-vowels to be the nuclei of syllables.
We couldgeneralize, for instance, by assumingApprop(NUCLEUS, syllable) = approximant.nasalto account for the more general case, or we could refineour hierarchy to include a new supertype of vowels whosesubtypes include liquids and nasals, say vocalic-nasaL14vowel?

2Feature structures are defined relative to a signature.A feature structure is taken to be a finite, rooted anddirected graph, in which nodes are labeled with typesand arcs with ffi~atures.
Feature structures are typi-ca.lly displayed as attril)ute-value matrices, where theI)ra.
('keting indicates the nodes, and features indicatethe arcs.
Feature structures must satisfy the appropri-ateness conditions, so that a node of type o" such thatApprop(f, rr) is delined must be connected by an arc la-Iwh,d f to a node of type r such that Approp(f, cr) E r.A feature st.ructurc meeting this condition is said to betotally u,Hl-typcd.
'l'he most general feature structure oftype vowel respecting the appropriateness conditions isgiven in l,'igure I.
This structure represents the featuregeometry common to all vowels.In addition to conditions of well-typedness, we re-(luirc every feature structure representing a grammat-ical linguistic structure to be fully resolved in the fol-lowing way.
Every type must be a maximally specificone, in the sense of not having any further subtypes.For instance, occurrences of the type bool must be re-solved to either + or -, and occurrences of type cons toeither an obstruent, glottal-pharyngeal, nasal, liquid orglide.
This amounts to a closed world interpretation ofour type hierarchies, wherein every type can be equatedlogically with the disjunction of its subtypes (see (Car-I)enl,er 19!)2)).
For instance, this equates ouorant with1.1,' di~iun('tion of the types glottal-pharyngeal, nasaland approx, so that ew~ry sol|oraut rrlltst t)c either glot-tal, nasal or al)l)roximanl.. Anot.her example involvesIwight, where the subtypes of height, high, reed and~ln addition, our hierarchies respect Carpenter's (1992)introduction condition, which requires the set of featuresfor which a feature f is appropriate to have a most generaltype.
This constraint is motivated computationally, in thatit forces the type inference algorithm to produce a uniquemost general result.
But this constraint can be easily relaxed(King and GStz 1993) or reconstructed from a hierarchywhich does not meet it (Carpenter and Pollard 1992).low, exhaust he possibilities.

is an arbitrary description, which is taken toconstrain the possibilities for objects of type o'.
Wetake constraints on a type to be inherited by all of theirsubtypes.
In general, we allow descriptions to specifytypes of objects, to specify the values of features byfurther descriptions, to impose equality and inequalityconstraints on objects.
In addition, descriptions aretaken to be closed under the logical operations of con-junction and disjunction, and the string operations ofconcatenation and Kleene-star.
Finally, we allow rela-tional and functional constraints by means of definiteclauses.
The string operations generalize the not;ion orc,,nsl, rainl, found in (Carpenter 1992) along lines sug-gested by l~eape (1991); such operations were coded byfunctional and relational constraints by Bird and Klein(1993) and by Mastroianni (1993).We will follow (Mastroianni 1993) in our treatmentof syllable structure and the arrangement of featuresin segments.
This work is closely relal,ed I.o thai.
pre-seuted in (Scobbie 1992), (Bird 1992), (Bird and Klein1993), and (Russell 1993).
One major difference be-tween our work and that of both Bird and Scobbie isthat we have given analyses of vowel harmony.
Scobbie,because of his adjacency meta-constraint, is unable todo this, and Bird gives no account of such processes, ei-ther.
In addition, we give an account of syllabificationand stress, neither of which were attempted by Bird orScobbie.
Our work shares with Russell's a concern forthe role of morphology both in triggering phonologicaloperations and in interfacing with other components ofgrammar.
Most of the analyses in these frameworks arecompatible with our approach; we believe they are bestviewed as instances of the same paradigm of monos-tratal, constraint-based morpho-phonology.We will assume that the type 7rot has subtypes whicha.re arranged as in Figure 2.

Anonset is allowable just in case the segments it containsare arranged in increasing sonority, and no phonotacticconstraints are violated.
Phonotactic onstraints aredefined separately for each language.
Some languagesallow exceptional onsets.
We handle this by definingexceptional onset types for each language.
In English,we have exceptional onsets formed from, e.g., s, k, r.The sonority condition on codas is the reverse; i.e., thesonority must.
decrease (in general, sonority decreaseswith dista.ncc from the nucleus).
An appendix can befi)rmed, ~u~ in cats, when wc \]lave a consonant clustercontaining two equally sonorous egments at the end ofa word.
For a Ibrmalization of the constraints on codasaml onsets, see (Mastroianni 1993).We will use the sonority ifierarchy again in the com-bination of syllabh,s.
It is a well-attested generalizationthat languages teud to put as much material as possi-ble into the onsets of syllables, rather than codas (themm:imal onset principle).
This principle can be ex-pressed in our systcm by constraining the SYLLS valuesof words.
We allow two syllables to combine only if thelast segment(s) of the first could not be combined intoa legal onset in the second syllable.
This is used in ourconstraint on simple-phon, given below.

Recursively, a syllable followed by a se-quence of syllables is consistent if the last root in theROOTS value of the first syllable cannot be combinedinto a valid onset with the first root in the ROOTSvalue of the following syllable, and the second syllable isconsistent with whatever follows.
A given pair of rootsmay not be combined into an onset if the second is lesssonorous than the first.
These definitions merely ex-press the maximal onset principle, modulo phonotacticconstraints and certain allowable exceptions.
We han-dle phonotactic onstraints with the gap/2 predicate,where gap(x, y) expresses that x is not allowed before yin an onset.
For instance, the sequence tl is an allowableonset with respect o sonority, but English disallows it.This can be seen in the word atlas, which syllabifiesas at-las rather than a-tlas.
To capture this English-specific, phonotactic onstraint, we take gap(t, l) to bea clause of gap/2 in English.

In English, this phe-nomenon is exemplified by many words ending in ther~gular plural and past-tense, such a.s cats, dogs, andwashed, which are realized as karts, dawgz, and wagl,r(q)cctively.
In each of these examples, the alveolar stopor sibilant which ends the word is of the same sonorityas the preceding consonant.
The standard treatmentof such words in autosegmental phonology is to allowsome kind of appendix to appear at the end of words.In our analysis, a phon-word bearing an appendix wouldbe of the type complex-phon.
By definition, such a wordhas a SYLLS value which consists of some (non-empty)sequence of syllables followed by an appendix.

Heavy syl-lables are stressed, except when they appear word-finally.
The standard foot is right headed; a wordwith no heavy syllables has all r ight-headed feet, anda word with a heavy syllable has right-headed feet tothe left of that syllable, with alternating stress afterthat.
Note that "heavy-syllable" must be defined hereas a syllable containing a long vowel.
11 We define aX?For simplicity, we will not be distinguishing betweenprimary and secondary stress here, though see our earlierdiscussion of Malak-Malak for indications of how such dis-tinctions can be treated in general.~lThis is an example of a "parameter" in our theory.

A heavy-rhyme willI)o ;~ rhyme which Ilas a long vowel as its nucleus.
Theheaviness of a rhyme will be independent of th~ pres-ence of a coda.
Thus, we will have open-heavy-rhymeand closed-heavy-rhyme as further subtypes, with andwithout codas, respectively (for present purposes, wewill abstract away fi'om a definition of the type coda).In the standard metrical t reatment presented in(Goldsmith 1990), the final syllable is marked as be-ing "e?trarnetrical" before foot construction proceeds.We will directly mimic this, without, however, usingordered procedures.
Instead, we require that the finalsylla.hle I)(~ unstressed and contained in a degeneratefo,~t.
This gives us the same results as the standard;i.na.lysis, I )ut  a.ltows us to keel) our I,'EE'r values of typefoot +.
In order to do this elegantly, we will split ourl.ype de.qenerale-foot into two subtypes, final-foot andnon-final-degen.
The only other type of fool in Yup'ikis the iambic foot, rh-foot.
We give the signature ntrytk~r the Yup'ik foot in Figure 9)  2'laWe now turn to stress azsignment in Yup'ik.
The ba-sic pattern is that  all complex feet are iambic, and allnon-final heavy syllables are stressed.
Thus, any heavysyllables which would not form the second element ofan lamb are put into stressed egenerate f et.
Degener-ate feet consisting of light syllables only appear at thethe signatures for some languages, we will want to definecl,,.,cdsyllables as being heavy, while in others we will wantthose syllables with long nuclei, whether open or closed, tobe considered he~Lvy.12Note that, for any type ~r, we take a n to be the type ofa sequence of n objects of type ~r.~3We have chosen to define all complex feet in Yup'ik toI)e binary by defining an appropriateness constraint in thesignature that the SYLLS value be of type syllabl~.

This is done with ore' constraint, asfollows.
(10) phon-wordFEET : ( rh-foot V non-fin-heavy*) ,final-footThis constraint says that we must have an unstresseddegenerate foot, as the final foot.
The penult imate footmay be either a rh-foot or a non-final degenerate foot.Finally, any preceding feet, must consist exelusiwqy ofrh-foot and non-fin-heavy feet.These definitions cornbine to give us a granutl;tr inwhich well-formed words must end in ;ul Ullstressedsyllable (by the definition of final-foot).
All syllablesnot contained in the final-fool of a word must be con-tained in an iambic foot, or be a stressed syllable con-tained in its own degenerate foot (by the definition ofallowable, the constraint on phon-word, and th(' def-initions of rh-foot and non-fin-heavy).
This gives usexactly the data presented above.Morphology: Icelandic UmlautingWe now briefly turn our attention to morphology.
As wementioned above, the phon value of a word will Imw' twofeatures, one for syllabification and stress, I'IIONOl,O(|Y,and another, MORP|IOLOGY, for morl>hoh)gical informa.-lion.
So far, we haw; only discussed the I>IIONOI,OGYvalues.
We will define a type morph, which will includeaffixes, infixes, stems, and words.
All objects of typeraorph will have, minimally, the features ItOOTS, andSYNSEM, filled by objects of types root + a.nd synsem, re-spectively.
We will divide the type word into simple andcomplex subtypes.
As an example of a MORPHOLOGYvalue, we give the feature structure for the word .fishesin Figure 10J 4For Icelandic, which exhibits vowel-harmony (um-lauting), we will add a feature VOWELS, a feature HARM,and a feature WORD.
These features will take values oftypes vowel +, harm, and bool, respectively.
The addi-tion of these features conforms fairly well to standardpractice in autosegmental phonology, with the VOWELSfeature corresponding to the vowel tier.
The featureHARM indicates whether vowel harmony is present, andthe feature WORD indicates whether the object in ques-tion is a full-fledged word (rather than, say, a partial ly-inflected word).
With these preliminaries, we can con-tinue with our analysis of Icelandic umlauting, whichwe treat ~ a cnse of vowel harmony.14 W~, arc asslling an IlPSG-like synl.ax and s~nlanti(:~.SYNSEM:eolnple~:- wordItOOTS:\[ (f, l, .

In theliterature, umlauting and vowel reduction in Icelandicare not typically referred to as vowel harmony.
How-ever it is clear that, in fact, these processes do matchthe standard definition of vowel harmony.
The processworks ~ follows.
Suppose we have a noun whose finalsyllable has a as its nucleus in the nominative singu-lar.
One.such word is fatnadh (suit).
When realizedwith the tin.live-plural Suffix, -urn, there is a vowel har-ninny elfiwt.

Under a derivational analysis, we havea vowel harmony effect in which an underlying a assim-ilates to a surface u when appropriately situated in astring of surface as, unless it is the first vowel in thestem, in which case, it partially assimilates, to 5.
Thusthe combination of underlying fatnadh with -urn, theresults in the surface form fb'tnudhum.
There exists aclass of nouns (mostly borrowings) which systematicallydiffer from this paradigm.
In this class of exceptions,the harmony process stops at some point, even thoughit would continue filrther under the standard paradigm(typically, only the final a assimilates).
In such cases,the I~otltmost a which assimilates is realized as 6.
Oneexample of such a word is akarn, which is realized asakgrnum in the dative-pluralJ 5Icelandic exhibil.s the ffllrther property that this har-mony process can sometimes occur without a u beingpresent.
This can be exemplified by the declension15In the following, all of the examples of such exceptionswill be of this sort, for the simple reason that we are unawareof any ca.ses in which the.assimilation stops further forwardin the word.
Our analysis will be able to accommodateeither case with no Mtera, tions, so this is not a problem.paradigm for barn (child) given below.
As we can secTable 1:s ingu larnominative barnaccusative barndative barnigenitive barnsplura lnominative b6rnaccusative b6rndative b6rnumgenitive barnaDeclension i)aradignl for barnfrom Table 1, there are cases when the harmonic formof a stem is used as an inflected form of the word.
Wecan handle this neatly in our formalism, as we shallshow below.We will need to divide the type harm into subtypesbool, nil, trigger, plus-nil, and minus-nil.
Plus-nil sub-sumes + and nil, while minus-nil subsumes - and nil.We will define several new subtypes of agr, in orderto account for the nominative and accusative casesshown in Table 1 above?
The type agr must havea new feature CASE, with values of type case.
Thetype case has subtypes nora-ace-case and gen-dat-case.Nora-ace-case has subtypes nominative and accusative,while gen-dat-case Ill.us subtypes genitive and dative.
Wcwill (leline two new itnme(liatc sul)tyl)cS of agr, gen-dal,and nom.acc.
As t.he names imply, ob?iects ol7 typegen-dat must have case  values of type gen-dat-case,while objects of type nora-ace must have CASE valuesof type nora-ace-case.
Nom-acc and gen-dat each haveplural and singular subtypes?
In order to illustrate howwe use these new features and types, the lexical con-straint for the word fatnadh is given in Figure 11.

As shown by Pollardaml Sag (1987), this allows a great deal of redundancyin h~xical descriptions to be factored into constraints atsuitable levels of generality using multiple inheritance.For instance, the harmony constraints given above willnot need to be expressed on a word-by-word basis.The goals allowable(C, ?, X) and harmonize(C, ?, X)in the lexical constraint ensure the following:(12) allowable(?, ?, X)l. nominative-singular words must have either- or nil as their HARM values.2.
nominative-plural  words must have either +or nil as their HARM values.3.
all nominative words have + as their WORDvalue.4.
all genitive and dative stems have - as theirWORD value, and may have any HARM value.harmoniz('(?, ,  X)1. if a word has a hARM value of nil or -, itsVOWELS value harmonizes with itself.2.
if a word has a HARM value of +, and itsVOWELS value is a singleton list containinga, then it harmonizes with a singleton listcontaining 5.3. recursively, if a word has a HARM value of +,and its VOWELS value is a list headed by a,then it harmonizes with a list headed by uonly if the two list's tails harmonize.4.
a list of vowels headed by some other vowelthan a or u harmonizes with itself.It should be noted that n-a-vowel subsumes all of thevowels except a and u.
Thus, the line referring toit causes the harmony process to terminate wheneversome other vowel than a or u occurs.
The lexica\[ con-straint states that we can have molTh which is a nom-inative singular third person noun with semantics uitiff we have HOOTS: (f, oq, t, n, o~2, dh), and VOWELS(~1, c~2).
Furthermore, the value of the HARMONY fea-ture, (a, a), and (cq, or2) must harmonize.
As we can seefi'om Figure 14, if the HARMONY value is either - or nil,then (a l ,  or2) must actually be (a,a).
If tim IIAR.MONYvalue is +, then (?Yt,c~2) must be (il,u).
All nmmbersof the sequence of vowels excel)t tim lirst must bc u,while the first nmst be 6.
The WORD fl,al.urc existsprimari ly to prevent, e.g., fglnudh I)y itself from be-ing recognized as a word.
We could change our signa-ture again, so that objects of type word had + as theirWORD value.
However, this is not really necessary.
TheWORD feature will come up again in the constraints onsuffix and complex-word.
As the reader can check, theconstraint above gives us fatnadh, with WORD value +,HARMONY value -, and AGR value nom-acc-sing, andfb'tnudh, with WOaD value -, HARMONY value + andAGR value nom-acc-sing.As the reader may have noticed, we handled the gen-eral harmony case by specifying that the entire valueof the VOWELS feature harmonize with some sequenceof as.
To handle the special cases, such as akarv, w(,merely need to specify that the l~st (qenlent of theVOWELS feature harmonize with a singleton list.
con-taining an a.
To handle cases where some other asharmonize further forward in the word, we wouhl onlyneed to force some final segment of the VOWELS va.hw toharmonize with some list of as.
As an example, we givethe lexical constraint for the word akarn in Figure 12.It should be noted that,  in this scheme, words which doVOWZLS: ff\](\[\]vowel,5\]voweO ^ROOTS: @, k,\[\], r, n) ^WORD: \['4\]bool AHARMONY: \[~bool) ^SYNSEM: (SEM: acorn ASYNCAT: ( n ^AGR:\[~\]7~oln-acc Asusc^' r :  ~) ^harmonize(E\], (a), (\[~\])) AaUowable(\[E, ~, ~)Figure 12: Lexical constraint for akarnnot have an a as their final vowel (i.e., as the head oftheir vOWELS value) must have nil as their HARMONYvalue.The constraints defining suffixes will be very similarto those defining words, ttere, all suffixes with a firstvowel u must have trigger as their HARMONY values (therest have nil).
The constraint defining the dative-pluralaffix -urn is given in Figure 13.
The way in which tileFIRST, SYNCAT, SUBCAT, etc., are passed to a COml)lex-word are exactly as in the English case (Mastroianni1993).
Here, the only differences are with respect tothe WORD and HARMONY vahles.
16We now turn our attention to the task of deliningconstraints on complex-word.
For this, we add two new16All affixes are defined in the signature to have - as theirWORD value; strictly speaking, this makes the reference toWORD:- in Figure 13 redundant.
However, it does make theconstraint to follow more readable.22VOWELS: (Xlu) A~mOTS: (\[\], E\]") AWORD:- AIIARMONY: trigger ASYNSEM: (SEM: (OPERATOR: dative-op AOPEItAND: sere) ASYNCA'r: (It AAGR: (NUM: pl;APEas: third ACASE: dative) ASUBCAT: (HD: (SYNSEM:SYNCAT:(n AAGR: horn-ace)) ATL: e-list)))Figure 13: (',onstraint on tim dative-plural suffix -urnfi'a.tures, STEM and MOD, with values of type word andallix, respectively.

The definite clausec,,mpatil)h'(?, ) is defined as follows.

'(trigger, nil)corn pati hie(nil, minus)compatible(nil, nil)The constraint in Figure 14 allows the dative affix tocombine with fb'tnudh and akgrn, but not fatnadh orakarn, which is the d'esired result.
Furthermore, thedative affix can combine with any word which has aI\[ARMONY value of nil.
Thus, it can combine with anyword which has a final vowel other than a.These deIiuitions allow us to deal with vowel harmonywithout resorting to some undefined non-local process.In this way, we have improved significantly on the pre-sentation in (Scohhie 1991).
We have also done this ina i)urcly mouostratal theory, without recourse to ruleordcri,gs, extrinsic or otherwise.Conc lus ionThe phonological theory which we have outlined hasseveral mlvantages, I)oth theoretical and practical, overthe standard autosegmeutal theories.1.
Our theory is properly formalized (see (Bird andI,add 1991) for an explanation of the formal short-comings of autoscgmental phonology).2.
Because we have kept the features geometry em-ployed in our segmental and metrical representationsclosely tied to observable acoustic phenomena, ourtheory can be given a semantics in terms of gesturalscores (we follow (Scohhie 1991) in this).3.
With our monostratal, declarative architecture, we('an do hoth generation and analysis using the samegralnulars.,I.

But the generality of the constraint-based representational system should not be confusedwith the restrictions on the linguistic theory.
Our ap-proach to phonology is quite restrictive in that all of thetechniques we have used merely represent he empMcalgeneralizations in an intuitive manner.
This should becontrasted, for example, with derivational theories inwhich simple constraints uch ms the sonority contourand the maximal onset principle are indirectly capturedthrough ordered context-sensitive r writing schemata.But, as with most work on linguistics, we have notspelled out the precise boundaries between the univer-sal and the language specific.Re ferencesS.
