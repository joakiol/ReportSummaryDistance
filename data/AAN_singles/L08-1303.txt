Event Detection and Summarization in Weblogs with Temporal CollocationsChun-Yuan Teng and Hsin-Hsi ChenDepartment of Computer Science and Information EngineeringNational Taiwan UniversityTaipei, Taiwan{r93019, hhchen}@csie.ntu.edu.twAbstractThis paper deals with the relationship between weblog content and time.
With the proposed temporal mutual information, we analyzethe collocations in time dimension, and the interesting collocations related to special events.
The temporal mutual information isemployed to observe the strength of term-to-term associations over time.
An event detection algorithm identifies the collocations thatmay cause an event in a specific timestamp.
An event summarization algorithm retrieves a set of collocations which describe an event.We compare our approach with the approach without considering the time interval.
The experimental results demonstrate that thetemporal collocations capture the real world semantics and real world events over time.1.2.IntroductionCompared with traditional media such as online newsand enterprise websites, weblogs have several uniquecharacteristics, e.g., containing abundant life experiencesand public opinions toward different topics, highlysensitive to the events occurring in the real world, andassociated with the personal information of bloggers.Some works have been proposed to leverage thesecharacteristics, e.g., the study of the relationship betweenthe content and bloggers?
profiles (Adamic & Glance,2005; Burger & Henderson, 2006; Teng & Chen, 2006),and content and real events (Glance, Hurst & Tornkiyo,2004; Kim, 2005; Thelwall, 2006; Thompson, 2003).In this paper, we will use temporal collocation tomodel the term-to-term association over time.
In the past,some useful collocation models (Manning & Sch?tze,1999) have been proposed such as mean and variance,hypothesis test, mutual information, etc.
Some worksanalyze the weblogs from the aspect of time like thedynamics of weblogs in time and location (Mei, et al,2006), the weblog posting behavior (Doran, Griffith &Henderson, 2006; Hurst, 2006), the topic extraction (Oka,Abe & Kato, 2006), etc.
The impacts of events on socialmedia are also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs afterLondon attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship betweenthe warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003),etc.This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 definestemporal collocation to model the strength of term-to-termassociations over time.
Section 3 introduces an eventdetection algorithm to detect the events in weblogs, andan event summarization algorithm to extract thedescription of an event in a specific time with temporalcollocations.
Section 4 shows and discusses theexperimental results.
Section 5 concludes the remarks.Temporal CollocationsWe derive the temporal collocations from Shannon?smutual information (Manning & Sch?tze, 1999) which isdefined as follows (Definition 1).Definition 1 (Mutual Information) The mutualinformation of two terms x and y is defined as:)()(),(log),(),(yPxPyxPyxPyxI =where P(x,y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y,and P(x) and P(y) denote the occurrence probability of xand y, respectively.Following the definition of mutual information, wederive the temporal mutual information modeling theterm-to-term association over time, and the definition isgiven as follows.Definition 2 (Temporal Mutual Information) Givena timestamp t and a pair of terms x and y, the temporalmutual information of x and y in t is defined as:)|()|()|,(log)|,()|,(tyPtxPtyxPtyxPtyxI =where P(x,y|t) is the probability of co-occurrence of termsx and y in timestamp t, P(x|t) and P(y|t) denote theprobability of occurrences of x and y in timestamp t,respectively.To measure the change of mutual information in timedimension, we define the change of temporal mutualinformation as follows.Definition 3 (Change of Temporal MutualInformation) Given time interval [t1, t2], the change oftemporal mutual information is defined as:121221)|,()|,(),,,(tttyxItyxIttyxC ?
?=where C(x,y,t1,t2) is the change of temporal mutualinformation of terms x and y in time interval [t1, t2], I(x,y|t1) and I(x,y| t2) are the temporal mutual information intime t1 and t2, respectively.3.
Event DetectionEvent detection aims to identify the collocationsresulting in events and then retrieve the description ofevents.
Figure 1 sketches an example of event detection.The weblog is parsed into a set of collocations.
Allcollocations are processed and monitored to identify theplausible events.
Here, a regular event ?Mother?s day?and an irregular event ?Typhoon Chanchu?
are detected.The event ?Typhoon Chanchu?
is described by the wordsFigure 1: An Example of Event Detection?Typhoon?, ?Chanchu?, ?2k?, ?Eye?, ?Path?
and?chinaphillippine?.The architecture of an event detection system includesa preprocessing phase for parsing the weblogs andretrieving the collocations; an event detection phasedetecting the unusual peak of the change of temporalmutual information and identifying the set of collocationswhich may result in an event in a specific time duration;and an event summarization phase extracting thecollocations related to the seed collocations found in aspecific time duration.The most important part in the preprocessing phase iscollocation extraction.
We retrieve the collocations fromthe sentences in blog posts.
The candidates are two termswithin a window size.
Due to the size of candidates, wehave to identify the set of tracking terms for furtheranalysis.
In this paper, those candidates containingstopwords or with low change of temporal mutualinformation are removed.In the event detection phase, we detect events byusing the peak of temporal mutual information in timedimension.
However, the regular pattern of temporalmutual information may cause problems to our detection.Therefore, we remove the regular pattern by seasonalindex, and then detect the plausible events by measuringthe unusual peak of temporal mutual information.If a topic is suddenly discussed, the relationshipbetween the related terms will become higher.
Twoalternatives including change of temporal mutualinformation and relative change of temporal mutualinformation are employed to detect unusual events.
Giventimestamps t1 and t2 with temporal mutual informationMI1 and MI2, the change of temporal mutual informationis calculated by (MI2-MI1).
The relative change oftemporal mutual information is calculated by (MI2-MI1)/MI1.For each plausible event, there is a seed collocation,e.g., ?Typhoon Chanchu?.
In the event descriptionretrieval phase, we try to select the collocations with thehighest mutual information with the word w in a seedcollocation.
They will form a collocation network for theevent.
Initially, the seed collocation is placed into thenetwork.
When a new collocation is added, we computethe mutual information of the multiword collocations bythe following formula, where n is the number ofcollocations in the network up to now.
?= n iMInInformatioMutualMultiwoIf the multiword mutual information is lower than athreshold, the algorithm stops and returns the words in thecollocation network as a description of the event.
Figure2 sketches an example.
The collocations ?Chanchu?spath?, ?Typhoon eye?, and ?Chanchu affects?
are addedinto the network in sequence based on their MI.We have two alternatives to add the collocations tothe event description.
The first method adds thecollocations which have the highest mutual informationas discussed above.
In contrast, the second method addsthe collocations which have the highest product of mutualinformation and change of temporal mutual information.Figure 2: An Example of Collocation network4.4.1.Experiments and DiscussionsTemporal Mutual Information versusMutual InformationIn the experiments, we adopt the ICWSM weblog dataset (Teng & Chen, 2007; ICWSM, 2007).
This data setcollected from May 1, 2006 through May 20, 2006 isabout 20 GB.
Without loss of generality, we use theEnglish weblog of 2,734,518 articles for analysis.To evaluate the effectiveness of time information, wemade the experiments based on mutual information(Definition 1) and temporal mutual information(Definition 2).
The former called the incrementalapproach measures the mutual information at each timepoint based on all available temporal information at thattime.
The latter called the interval-based approachconsiders the temporal mutual information in differenttime stamps.
Figures 3 and 4 show the comparisonsbetween interval-based approach and incrementalapproach, respectively, in the event of Da Vinci Code.We find that ?Tom Hanks?
has higher change oftemporal mutual information compared to ?Da VinciCode?.
Compared to the incremental approach in Figure 4,the interval-based approach can reflect the exact releasedate of ?Da Vinci Code.
?rd=i 1 4.2.
Evaluation of Event DetectionWe consider the events of May 2006 listed inwikipedia1 as gold standard.
On the one hand, the eventsposted in wikipedia are not always complete, so that weadopt recall rate as our evaluation metric.
On the otherhand, the events specified in wikipedia are not alwaysdiscussed in weblogs.
Thus, we search the contents ofblog post to verify if the events were touched on in ourblog corpus.
Before evaluation, we remove the eventslisted in wikipedia, but not referenced in the weblogs.Figure 3: Interval-based Approach in Da Vinci CodeFigure 4: Incremental Approach in Da Vinci Codegure 5 sketches the idea of evaluation.
The left sideof t s figure shows the collocations detected by our eventdete tion system, and the right side shows the eventsliste  in wikipedia.
After matching these two lists, wecan find that the first three listed events were correctlyidentified by our system.
Only the event ?Nepal CivilWar?
was listed, but not found.
Thus, the recall rate is75% in this case.Figure 5: Evaluation of Event Detection PhaseAs discussed in Section 3, we adopt change oftemporal mutual information, and relative change oftemporal mutual information to detect the peak.
In Figure6, we compare the two methods to detect the events inweblogs.
The relative change of temporal mutualinformation achieves better performance than the changeof temporal mutual information.1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2006Table 1 and Table 2 list the top 20 collocations basedon these two approaches, respectively.
The results of thefirst approach show that some collocations are related tothe feelings such as ?fell left?
and time such as ?Saturdaynight?.
In contrast, the results of the second approachshow more interesting collocations related to the newsevents at that time, such as terrorists ?zacariasmoussaoui?
and ?paramod mahajan.?
These two personswere killed in May 3.
Besides, ?Geena Davis?
got thegolden award in May 3.
That explains why thecollocations detected by relative change of temporalmutual information are better than those detected bychange of temporal mutual information.-20-15-10-505101 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19Time (day)Mutual informationDa-Vinci Tom HanksFigure 6: Performance of Event Detection Phase-15-10-505101 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19Time (day)Mutual informationDa-Vinci Tom HanksCollocations CMI Collocations CMIMay 03 9276.08 Current music 1842.67Illegal immigrants 5833.17 Hate studying 1722.32Feel left 5411.57 Stephen Colbert 1709.59Saturday night 4155.29 Thursday night 1678.78Past weekend 2405.32 Can?t believe 1533.33White house 2208.89 Feel asleep 1428.18Red sox 2208.43 Ice cream 1373.23Album tool 2120.30 Oh god 1369.52Sunday morning 2006.78 Illegalimmigration 1368.1216.56fCMI32.5031.6329.0928.4528.3428.13Sunday night 1992.37 Pretty cool 13Table 1: Top 20 collocations with highest change otemporal mutual informationCollocations CMI Collocationscasinos online 618.36 Diet sodaszacarias moussaoui 154.68 Ving rhamesTsunami warning 107.93 Stock picksConspirator zacarias 71.62 Happy humpArtist formerly 57.04 Wong kanFederalJury41.78 Sixapartcommovabletype Wed 3 39.20 Aaron echolls 27.48Pramod mahajan 35.41 Phnom penh 25.78BBCVersion35.21 Livejournalsixapartcom23.83  FihicdGeena davis 33.64 George yeo 20.34Table 2: Top 20 collocations with highest relative changeof mutual information4.3.
Evaluation of Event SummarizationAs discussed in Section 3, we have two methods toinclude collocations to the event description.
Method 1employs the highest mutual information, and Method 2utilizes the highest product of mutual information andchange of temporal mutual information.
Figure 7 showsthe performance of Method 1 and Method 2.
We can seethat the performance of Method 2 is better than that ofMethod 1 in most cases.Figure 7: Overall Performance of Event SummarizationThe results of event summarization by Method 2 areshown in Figure 8.
Typhoon Chanchu appeared in thePacific Ocean on May 10, 2006, passed throughPhilippine and China and resulted in disasters in theseareas on May 13 and 18, 2006.
The appearance of thetyphoon Chanchu cannot be found from the events listedin wikipedia on May 10.
However, we can identify theappearance of typhoon Chanchu from the description ofthe typhoon appearance such as ?typhoon named?
and?Typhoon eye.
In addition, the typhoon Chanchu?s pathcan also be inferred from the retrieved collocations suchas ?Philippine China?
and ?near China?.
The response ofbloggers such as ?unexpected typhoon?
and ?8 typhoons?is also extracted.Figure 8: Event Summarization for Typhoon Chanchu5.
Concluding RemarksThis paper introduces temporal mutual information tocapture term-term association over time in weblogs.
Theextracted collocation with unusual peak which is in termsof relative change of temporal mutual information isselected to represent an event.
We collect thosecollocations with the highest product of mutualinformation and change of temporal mutual informationto summarize the specific event.
The experiments onICWSM weblog data set and evaluation with wikipediaevent lists at the same period as weblogs demonstrate thefeasibility of the proposed temporal collocation modeland event detection algorithms.Currently, we do not consider user groups andlocations.
This methodology will be extended to modelthe collocations over time and location, and therelationship between the user-preferred usage ofcollocations and the profile of users.AcknowledgmentsResearch of this paper was partially supported byNational Science Council, Taiwan (NSC96-2628-E-002-240-MY3) and Excellent Research Projects of NationalTaiwan University (96R0062-AE00-02).ReferencesAdamic, L.A., Glance, N.
