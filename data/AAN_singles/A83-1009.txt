Although some ef for t  has been devotedto primarily Interactive approaches to the problem, andto mwmages which have highly predictable cniumnarsummary formats, the majority of the research anddevelopment work has concentrated on the more diff iculttask of analyzing unformatted narrative l:axt with userInteraction limited to occasional sssistmlca to theautomated system.A teethed system called MATRES has been constructedIn Prolog to run under the UNiX operating system on thePOP 11/70.
MATRES Is a knowledge based system forundorotanding the natural language text  of event -oriented massages tn the domains of air activit ies andspace/missile (S&M) activities.
The knowledge struc-tures In MATRES, called "templates a, are essential lyframes or scripts describing entit ies and events, whichanswer the military u~er's bsolc questions about these1.
This work has been carried out under thesponsorship of the Rome Air Development Center(RADC), U. S. Air Force Systems Command, Grlffiss Air:'~,-~e 8aBe,  New York.MlenmmmL as I l lustrated In the simplified view of anevent  template pr lmentod In Figure 1.The templatee are hierarchically organized; lower leveltemplates deal with ot)Jects or times, mid level withevarlts containing objects  and times, higher level withactivit ies composed of  events.
The slots in the tam-plates contadn procedures which operate upon the out-put o f  the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantlatathe templatlm.We are currently using a corpus of  spprcximstaF/ 125messages In the S&M domain s~ a basis for developing ascenario for evaluation of  the extended MATRESteatl~bed, ms well ms a teethed for a related knowledgebaaed ayltem, the Act ive/ Introspect ive information Sys-tem \[desCribed In Montgomery and Ruapini 1981, andRuapinl 1982\ ]  for  which MATRES serves  an a front end.The scanmlo Involves two simulated nations, the DeltaCol~edaratton of  the Atlantic States and the EpsilonRepobllk:.
Both netlone have space programs, and eachIs interested in monitoring the technological progress ofthe other, using their own satai l l te and sensor resourcesmid those of  other fr iendly neUon8.
The sot  of  fifes-sages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports ofspace and satel l i te launches and orbital activit ies of theDelta Confederation, which are being monitored andevaluated by the Epsllon RepubUc.
The text  o1' mes-sages used In the scenario has the structure and formatof  actual messages reporting on S&M activities, althoughthe lexicon is substantial ly di f ferent.All discumled In several  previous technical reportsprepared under earlier contracts with RAOC (~Kuhns andMantgamary 1973\] ,  \[Silva at  el 19790\] ,  \[Silva et sl1979b\]) ,  the subset ot' the English language on whichthe text  Of Intell igence messages 18 based Is essentisl lya specialized language for reporting events.
Intermixedwith factual statements reporting on entit les andevents, however, Is much evaluative commentary.
More-over, proms announcements of the Oeita Confederationare Included In the reports, and evaluat ive comments aremade both about the events  reported In the pressannouncements and the announcements themselves.
Insynthesizing data base elements from these messages,it is crucial to sort out these di f ferent  levels of informa-tion.This paper defines an approach to identifying and label-Ing those types of  Information so that they can beexploited In the context  of MATRES and the data basesystems which It serves.55QUESTIONWItATWHOWHENWHERETO WHOM~n4YINFORMATION PARAMETER8 OF A PROTOTYPE TEMPt.ATEPROTOTYPE EVENTEVENT TYPEAGENT (OR OBJECT PLUSOWNER)TIME OF THEEVENTLOCATION AT WHICHEVENT TOOK PLACEPATIENT, OR ENTITY AF-FECTED BY THE EVENTINTERPRETATION OF THEEVENTPROTOTYPE OFSPECIFIC EVENTAIRSPACE VIOLATIONAIRCRAFT OWNEDBY COUNTRY CTIME AT WHICH VIO"LATION OCCURREDLOCATION AT WHICHVIOLATION OCCURREDOWNER OF VIO-LATED AIRSPACEPROBABLE REASON FORVIOLATION EVENTEXAMPLEAIRSPACE VIOLATIONA UGANOAN FIGHTERAIRCRAFTAT AB(~T 0200 HOURSON 25 APRIL 19788 MILES FROM THE KENYA80ROER NEAR SUAMKENYAPROBABLE RECONNAISSANCEMiSSiONFlguro 1, Four Aspects  o f  an Event Template.2.0 THE RESEARCH PROBLEM/Ul noted above, the subiengusge of  the message car-pore for  the air sotivitJes and S&M domains Is essential lya vehicle for ~ n g  events.

Part o fthe modet derives from the event  c lmi f i caUon schemamentlmled shove, and Il lustrated in Figure 2, which wasdeveiooed to account for the levels of  content occurlngin the event-or iented message disooume, in this clan-slficetion, there are two major types  of  events, metemeats  and n~t -mete  event  I .
Of the letter, events maybo al~lorvartkNlei, Or prlmltive.
An obaervetlonaJ evenf~la a direct perception of  an event, which may be a visualpercopUon (e.g., "observe",  "sightS), Or In Ute cane of  asensor, an electronic measurement of  the emittedenergy charanterizlng the event.
A primlt|ve event  isthus a physical event  of  some kind which does notInvolve an obaervaUon Or per~epUQn.
Primitive eventomay be at t r ibut ive Or relat loeai .
An attribuUve eventdoacriben a situation In which a particular entity hag ?partiooiar attr ibute at a certain time or during a particu-lar time Interval (other than the attr ibute location, whichIs coveted under relational events),  for example: WTer-rex 534 operates In the high density mode".
A relationalevent Involves entit les which stand In an n-sty relationwith oath  other st a certain Urea or during s f ixed timeperiod.
The Importance of the subclasses of world pointand world point qualification event8 la in defining theworld l i ra of sn entity, say the track cf s ship or subma-rine.
Of these distinctions, the moat relevant for thisdiscussion ere those Involving mete-events  and me-mete events,  and of  the latter, primiUve vef=us obaer -vetkmad events.In torero of the scenm'io described aDQve, a primitiveovwrt  many occur, say, ?

mete-event= the common denominator of  the rues-mlge traff ic.
At the same time, the Deltas may releasean Internal report  about the launch, which would also(mnstltlxte s zeroth order mote-event.
Based on thatapor t ,  the Delta pr im agency, NYT, may Issue ansnnounomaent of  the primitive event,  the snnmmoemsntthus e~nwUtutea s f ~ d e r  mete -event .
An EpsllonRepublk: rq~rter  may then make an Interpretation of.that ennota~enent~ In the form of  a report, whichbeing a report  of  4 f i rst -order mete-event  - -  Is there-fore m aecmtd ~ mete-event .
Corrections or otherchanges made by El=~lllon reporters to these messagesconstitute a th i rd mete level  o f  report ing event, sincethey may reference reports of  reports of events.The m(xlet thu l  fair accounts for  the event  reportingstructure which undmtioa the Delta/Epsilon scenario, butwe must slam acm~alt for  the repo~ar 's  comments aboutthe event  - -  Le., his interpretation or evaluation of theevent  - -  which can occur at any of these levels.The moortor~s goaJ Is to Identify and denoribe all therelevant parameters of  an event  (exemplif ied by the~ots  In the template for a launch event,  shown in thecenter of Figure 5) based on the observational reportproduced by the sensor and any other information hemay h ive  (e.g., knowledge that a replacement of s non-functioning communications satel l i te is likely within agiven time frame).
However, if the reportor 's InformationIs Incomplete or Imprecise, he cannot exactJy describethe parameters of  an event, but will give his bestInterpretation of  the event  baaed on whet he knows.Thus he may report a launch of "an unidentified sate l -lite", "a probable television support satel l i te",  "s possi-ble CE satel l ite".
In some cases, ho may have enoughInformation to make a comperaUve evaluation with launchevents which have occurTed In the pest: "a new ESV","the second CE satel l i te to be successful ly orbited bythe Deitim this year".

Thus,88 represented In Figure 5, an Imitantiated launch tent-plate produced frmn an obaervaUonal event  and a primi-t ive event  (a zeroth order reporting event,  ea i l lustratedin Figure 4) may have several  additional quallficetlorm(exemplif ied by, hut not Ilmlted to, the mete templatesllh~streted In the figure).

All or none of  the listedpsi 'easters for ?

Thus, in Figure 5, the Epalk=n reporter bel ievesthat, to the best of  hhl knowledge, the space objectInvolved In the major launch event  18 a "probable" CE orcrop enhancement satell ite, and that the time of launchIS "approximate\[y" 113OZ.Each mete template ha8 field8 which Identify the source,am weft ms the Use and date of  the Interpretive Informa-t i l l .

The template and mats template structures shown inthis figure are Intended to be Il lustrative only: forexample, the object,  date/t ime group, and deorbitinformation constitute embedded templates linked tothe main "launch" event  template by pointers.
