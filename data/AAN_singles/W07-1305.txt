of Dutchdialects.
We used 360 dialects from loca-tions in the Netherlands, the northern partof Belgium and French-Flanders.
The den-sity of dialect locations is about the sameeverywhere.
For each dialect we recon-structed 85 words.
For the reconstruction ofvowels we used knowledge of Dutch his-tory, and for the reconstruction of conso-nants we used well-known tendenciesfound in most textbooks about historicallinguistics.
We validated results by com-paring the reconstructed forms with pro-nunciations according to a proto-Germanicdictionary (K?bler, 2003).
For 46% of thewords we reconstructed the same vowel orthe closest possible vowel when the vowelto be reconstructed was not found in thedialect material.
For 52% of the words allconsonants we reconstructed  were thesame.
For 42% of the words, only one con-sonant was differently reconstructed.
Wemeasured the divergence of Dutch dialectsfrom their ?proto-language?.
We measuredpronunciation distances to the proto-language we reconstructed ourselves andcorrelated them with pronunciation dis-tances we measured to proto-Germanicbased on the dictionary.
Pronunciation dis-tances were measured using Levenshteindistance, a string edit distance measure.
Wefound a relatively strong correlation(r=0.87).1 IntroductionIn Dutch dialectology the Reeks Nederlandse Dia-lectatlassen (RND), compiled by Blancquaert &P?e (1925-1982) is an invaluable data source.
Theatlases cover the Dutch language area.
The Dutcharea comprises The Netherlands, the northern partof Belgium (Flanders), a smaller northwestern partof France, and the German county of Bentheim.The RND contains 1956 varieties, which can befound in 16 volumes.
For each dialect 139 sen-tences are translated and transcribed in phoneticscript.
Blancquaert mentions that the questionnaireused for this atlas was conceived of as a range ofsentences with words that illustrate particularsounds.
The design was such that, e.g., variouschanges of older Germanic vowels, diphthongs andconsonants are represented in the questionnaire(Blancquaert 1948, p. 13).
We exploit here the his-torical information in this atlas.The goals of this paper are twofold.
First we aimto reconstruct a ?proto-language?
on the basis ofthe RND dialect material and see how close wecome to the protoforms found in Gerhard K?bler?sneuhochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch(K?bler, 2003).
We recognize that we actually re-construct a stage that would never have existed inprehistory.
In practice, however, we are usuallyforced to use incomplete data, since data collec-tions -- such as the RND ?
are restricted by politi-cal boundaries, and often some varieties are lost.In this paper we show the usefulness of a datasource like the RND.Second we want to measure the divergence ofDutch dialects compared to their proto-language.We measure the divergence of the dialect pronun-ciations.
We do not measure the number ofchanges that happened in the course of time.
For31example if a [u] changed into a [y] and then the [y]changed into a [u], we simply compare the [u] tothe proto-language pronunciation.
However, we docompare Dutch dialects to both the proto-languagewe reconstruct ourselves, which we call Proto-Language Reconstructed (PLR), and to the Proto-language according to the proto-Germanic Dic-tionary, which we call Proto-Germanic accordingto the Dictionary (PGD).2 Reconstructing the proto-languageFrom the nearly 2000 varieties in the RND weselected 360 representative dialects from locationsin the Dutch language area.
The density oflocations is about the same everywhere.In the RND, the same 141 sentences are trans-lated and transcribed in phonetic script for eachdialect.
Since digitizing the phonetic texts is time-consuming on the one hand, and since our proce-dure for measuring pronunciation distances is aword-based method on the other hand, we initiallyselected from the text only 125 words.
Each setrepresents a set of potential cognates, inasmuch asthey were taken from translations of the same sen-tence in each case.
In K?bler?s dictionary we foundtranslations of 85 words only; therefore our analy-ses are based on those 85 words.We use the comparative method (CM) as themain tool for reconstructing a proto-form on thebasis of the RND material.
In the following sub-sections we discuss the reconstruction of vowelsand consonants respectively.2.1 VowelsFor the reconstruction of vowels we used knowl-edge about sound developments in the history ofDutch.
In Old Dutch the diphthongs // and //turned into monophthongs // and // respectively(Quak & van der Horst 2002, p. 32).
Van Bree(1996) mentions the tendencies that lead // and// to change into // and // respectively.
Fromthese data we find the following chains: ?
 ?
 ?
 ?
 ?
 ?
An example is twee ?two?
which has the vowel[] in 11% of the dialects, the [] in 14% of thedialects, the [] in 43% of the dialects and the [] in20% of the dialects.
1  According to the neu-hochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch the [] or[] is the original sound.
Our data show that sim-ply reconstructing the most frequent sound, whichis the [], would not give the original sound, butusing the chain the original sound is easily found.To get evidence that the // has raised to //(and probably later to //) in a particular word, weneed evidence that the // was part of the chain.Below we discuss another chain where the // haslowered to //, and where the // is missing in thechain.
To be sure that the // was part of the chain,we consider the frequency of the //, i.e.
the num-ber of dialects with // in that particular word.
Thefrequency of // should be higher than the fre-quency of // and/or higher than the frequency of//.
Similarly for the change from // to // weconsider the frequency of //.Another development mentioned by Van Bree isthat high monophthongs diphthongize.
In the tran-sition from middle Dutch to modern Dutch, themonophthong // changed into //, and the mo-nophthong // changed into either // or /	/(Van der Wal, 1994).
According to Van Bree(1996, p. 99), diphthongs have the tendency tolower.
This can be observed in Polder Dutch where// and // are lowered to // and // (Stroop1998).
We recognize the following chains: ?
 ?
?/	 ?
 ?
 ?
Different from the chains mentioned above, wedo not find the // and // respectively in thesechains.
To get evidence for these chains, the fre-quency of // should be lower than both the fre-quency of // and //, and the frequency of //should be lower than both /	/ and //.Sweet (1888, p. 20) observes that vowels havethe tendency to move from back to front.
Back1The sounds mentioned may be either monophthongs ordiphthongs.32vowels favour rounding, and front vowels un-rounding.
From this, we derive five chains: ??
??
 ?
 ?
 ?
? ?
?
?
However, unrounded front vowels might be-come rounded under influence from a labial orlabiodental consonant.
For example vijf ?five?
issometimes pronounced as [] and sometimes as[].
The [] has been changed into [] under in-fluence of the labiodental [] and [].Sweet (1888, p. 22) writes that the dropping ofunstressed vowels is generally preceded by variousweakenings in the direction of a vowel close toschwa.
In our data we found that the word mijn?my?
is sometimes [] and sometimes [].
A non-central unstressed vowel might change into a cen-tral vowel which in turn might be dropped.
In gen-eral we assume that deletion of vowels is morelikely than insertion of vowels.Most words in our data have one syllable.
Foreach word we made an inventory of the vowelsused across the 360 varieties.
We might recognizea chain in the data on the basis of vowels whichappear at least two times in the data.
For 37 wordswe could apply the tendencies mentioned above.
Inthe other cases, we reconstruct the vowel by usingthe vowel found most frequently among the 360varieties, working with Occam?s Razor as a guid-ing principle.
When both monophthongs and diph-thongs are found among the data, we choose themost frequent monophthong.
Sweet (1888, p. 21)writes that isolative diphthongizaton ?mainly af-fects long vowels, evidently because of the diffi-culty of prolonging the same position withoutchange.
?2.2 ConsonantsFor the reconstruction of consonants we used tentendencies which we discuss one by one below.Initial and medial voiceless obstruents becomevoiced when (preceded and) followed by a voicedsound.
Hock & Joseph (1996) write that weakening(or lenition) ?occurs most commonly in a medialvoiced environment (just like Verner?s law), butmay be found in other contexts as well.?
In ourdata set zes ?six?
is pronounced with a initial [] inmost cases and with an initial [] in the dialects ofStiens and Dokkum.
We reconstructed [].2Final voiced obstruents of an utterance becomevoiceless.
Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natu-ral isolative tendency is to change voice into un-voiced.
He also writes that the ?tendency to un-voicing is shown most strongly in the stops.?
Hock& Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that final devoicing?is not confined to utterance-final position but ap-plies word-finally as well.?
3  In our data set wefound that for example the word-final consonantin op ?on?
is sometimes a [p] and sometimes a [b].Based on this tendency, we reconstruct the [b].Plosives become fricatives between vowels, be-fore vowels or sonorants (when initial), or aftervowels (when final).
Sweet writes that the ?openingof stops generally seems to begin between vow-els??
(p. 23).
Somewhat further he writes that inDutch the g has everywhere become a fricativewhile in German the initial g remained a stop.
Forexample goed ?good?
is pronounced as [] inFrisian dialects, while other dialects have initial []or [].
Following the tendency, we consider the []to be the older sound.
Related to this is the pronun-ciation of words like schip ?ship?
and school?school?.
As initial consonants we found [sk], [sx]and [].
In cases like this we consider the [sk] asthe original form, although the [k] is not found be-tween vowels, but only before a vowel.Oral vowels become nasalized before nasals.Sweet (1888) writes that ?nothing is more commonthan the nasalizing influence of a nasal on a pre-ceding vowels?
and that there ?is a tendency todrop the following nasal consonant as superfluous?when ?the nasality of a vowel is clearly developed?and ?the nasal consonant is final, or stands beforeanother consonant.?
(p. 38) For example gaan ?togo?
is pronounced as [] in the dialect of Dok-2In essence, in this and other such cases, a version ofthe manuscript-editing principle of choosing the?lectio difficilior?
was our guiding principle.3We do feel, however, that word-final devoicing, eventhough common cross-linguistically, is, as Hock1976 emphasizes, not phonetically determined butrather reflects the generalization of utterance-finaldevelopments into word-final position, owing to theoverlap between utterance-finality and word-finality.33kum, and as [] in the dialect of Stiens.
The na-salized [] in the pronunciation of Stiens alreadyindicates the deletion of a following nasal.Consonants become palatalized before frontvowels.
According to Campbell (2004) ?palataliza-tion often takes place before or after i and j or be-fore other front vowels, depending on the lan-guage, although unconditioned palatalization canalso take place.?
An example might be vuur whichis pronounced like [] in Frisian varieties,while most other varieties have initial [] or []followed by [] or [].Superfluous sounds are dropped.
Sweet (1888)introduced this principle as one of the principles ofeconomy (p. 49).
He especially mentioned that in[ ] the superfluous [] is often dropped (p. 42).
Inour data we found that krom ?curved?
is pro-nounced [!
"] in most cases, but as [!
"#] inthe dialect of Houthalen.
In the reconstructed formwe posit the final [#].Medial [h] deletes between vowels, and initial[h] before vowels.
The word hart ?heart?
is some-times pronounced with and sometimes without ini-tial [$].
According to this principle we reconstructthe [$].
[r] changes to [].
According to Hock and Jo-seph (1996) the substitution of uvular [%] for trilled(post-)dental [] is an example of an occasionalchange apparently resulting from misperception.
Inthe word rijp ?ripe?
we find initial [] in most casesand [%] in the dialects of Echt and Baelen.
We re-constructed [].Syllable initial [w] changes in [].
Under ?Lipto Lip-teeth?
Sweet (1888) writes that in ?thechange of p into f, w into v, we may always assumean intermediate [&], ['],  the latter being the Mid-dle German w?
(p. 26), and that  the ?loss of backmodification is shown in the frequent change of(w) into (v) through ['], as in Gm.?
Since v ?meant as ?voiced lip-to-teeth fricative?
?
is close to[(] ?
lip-to-teeth sonorant ?
we reconstruct [)] ifboth [)] and [(] are found in the dialect pronuncia-tions.
This happens for example in the word wijn?wine?.The cluster ol+d/t diphthongizes to ou + d/t.
Forexample English old and German alt have a /l/ be-fore the /d/ and /t/ respectively.
In Old Dutch olchanged into ou (Van Loey 1967, p. 43, Van Bree1987, p. 135/136).
Therefore we reconstruct the /l/with preceding // or //.3 The proto-language according to thedictionaryThe dictionary of K?bler (2003) provides Ger-manic proto-forms.
In our Dutch dialect data setwe have transcriptions of 125 words per dialect.We found 85 words in the dictionary.
Other wordswere missing, especially plural nouns, and verbforms other than infinitives are not included in thisdictionary.For most words, many proto-Germanic formsare given.
We used the forms in italics only sincethese are the main forms according to the author.
Ifdifferent lexical forms are given for the sameword, we selected only variants of those lexicalforms which appear in standard Dutch or in one ofthe Dutch dialects.The proto-forms are given in a semi-phoneticscript.
We converted them to phonetic script inorder to make them as comparable as possible tothe existing Dutch dialect transcriptions.
This ne-cessitated some interpretation.
We made the fol-lowing interpretation for monophthongs:spel-lingpho-neticspel-lingpho-neticspel-lingpho-netic *  +*  * *  +*  * * 	 * 	* * 	  * *Diphthongs are interpreted as follows:spel-lingpho-neticspel-lingpho-neticai * ei *au * eu *We interpreted the consonants according to thefollowing scheme:34spel-lingpho-neticspel-lingpho-neticspel-lingpho-neticp #*  f * m "*b ,, * * * n ,  *t *  s * ng  *d -*  z * w )k !
*  h  , $* r *g , *   l .
*j *Lehmann (2005-2007) writes that in the earlystage  of Proto-Germanic ?each of the obstruentshad the same pronunciation in its variouslocations??.
?Later, /b d g/ had fricativeallophones when medial between vowels.Lehmann (1994) writes that in  Gothic ?/b, d, g/has stop articulation initially, finally and whendoubled, fricative articulation between vowels.
?We adopted this scheme, but were restricted by theRND consonant set.
The fricative articulation of/,/ would be ['] or [].
We selected the [] sincethis sound is included in the RND set.
The fricativearticulation of /-/ would be [/], but this consonantis not in the RND set.
We therefore used the [-]which we judge perceptually to be closer to the [/]than to the [].
The fricative articulation of // is// which was available in the RND set.We interpreted the h as [$] in initial position,and as [] in medial and final positions.
An n be-fore k, g or h is interpreted as [ ], and as [] in allother cases.
The  should actually be interpreted as[0], but this sound in not found in the RND set.Just as we use [-] for [/], analogously we use []for [0].
We interpret double consonants are gemi-nates, and transcribe them as single long conso-nants.
For example nn becomes [].Several words end in a ?-?
in K?bler?s diction-ary, meaning that the final sounds are unknown orirrelevant to root and stem reconstructions.
In ourtranscriptions, we simply note nothing.4 Measuring divergence of Dutch dialectpronunciations with respect to theirproto-languageOnce a protolanguage is reconstructed, we are ableto measure the divergence of the pronunciations ofdescendant varieties with respect to that protolan-guage.
For this purpose we use Levenshtein dis-tance, which is explained in Section 4.1.
In Sec-tions 4.2 the Dutch dialects are compared to PLRand PGD respectively.
In Section 4.3 we comparePLR with PGD.4.1 Levenshtein distanceIn 1995 Kessler introduced the Levenshtein dis-tance as a tool for measuring linguistic distancesbetween language varieties.
The Levenshtein dis-tance is a string edit distance measure, and Kesslerapplied this algorithm to the comparison of Irishdialects.
Later the same technique was successfullyapplied to Dutch (Nerbonne et al 1996; Heeringa2004: 213?278).
Below, we give a brief explana-tion of the methodology.
For a more extensive ex-planation see Heeringa (2004: 121?135).4.1.1 AlgorithmUsing the Levenshtein distance, two varieties arecompared by measuring the pronunciation ofwords in the first variety against the pronunciationof the same words in the second.
We determinehow one pronunciation might be transformed intothe other by inserting, deleting or substitutingsounds.
Weights are assigned to these three opera-tions.
In the simplest form of the algorithm, all op-erations have the same cost, e.g., 1.Assume the Dutch word hart ?heart?
is pro-nounced as [$] in the dialect of Vianen (TheNetherlands) and as [+] in the dialect of Naz-areth (Belgium).
Changing one pronunciation intothe other can be done as follows:*$  delete $   1  subst.
/+  1+  insert    1+*???????????????
?335In fact many string operations map [$] to[+].
The power of the Levenshtein algorithm isthat it always finds the least costly mapping.To deal with syllabification in words, theLevenshtein algorithm is adapted so that only avowel may match with a vowel, a consonant with aconsonant, the [j] or [w] with a vowel (or oppo-site), the [i] or [u] with a consonant (or opposite),and a central vowel (in our research only theschwa) with a sonorant (or opposite).
In this wayunlikely matches (e.g.
a [p] with an [a]) are pre-vented.4   The longest alignment has the greatestnumber of matches.
In our example we thus havethe following alignment:$* * * ** * +* * * *?????????????
?1 1   14.1.2 Operations weightsThe simplest versions of this method are based ona notion of phonetic distance in which phoneticoverlap is binary: non-identical phones contributeto phonetic distance, identical ones do not.
Thusthe pair [,1] counts as different to the same degreeas [,].
The version of the Levenshtein algorithmwhich we use in this paper is based on the com-parison of spectrograms of the sounds.
Since aspectrogram is the visual representation of theacoustical signal, the visual differences betweenthe spectrograms are reflections of the acousticaldifferences.
The spectrograms were made on thebasis of recordings of the sounds of the Interna-tional Phonetic Alphabet as pronounced by JohnWells and Jill House on the cassette The Sounds ofthe International Phonetic Alphabet from 1995.
5The different sounds were isolated from the re-cordings and monotonized at the mean pitch ofeach of the two speakers with the programPRAAT6 (Boersma & Weenink, 2005).
Next, for4Rather than matching a vowel with a consonant, thealgorithm will consider one of them as an insertionand another as a deletion.5Seehttp://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/cassette.htm.6The program PRAAT is a free public-domain programdeveloped by Paul Boersma and David Weenink ateach sound a spectrogram was made with PRAATusing the so-called Barkfilter, a perceptually ori-ented model.
On the basis of the Barkfilter repre-sentation, segment distances were calculated.
In-serted or deleted segments are compared to silence,and silence is represented as a spectrogram inwhich all intensities of all frequencies are equal to0.
We found that the [2] is closest to silence andthe [] is most distant.
This approach is describedextensively in Heeringa (2004, pp.
79-119).In perception, small differences in pronunciationmay play a relatively strong role in comparison tolarger differences.
Therefore we used logarithmicsegment distances.
The effect of using logarithmicdistances is that small distances are weighted rela-tively more heavily than large distances.4.1.3 Processing RND dataThe RND transcribers use slightly different nota-tions.
In order to minimize the effect of these dif-ferences, we normalized the data for them.
Theconsistency problems and the way we solved themare extensively discussed in Heeringa (2001) andHeeringa (2004).
Here we mention one problemwhich is highly relevant in the context of this pa-per.
In the RND the ee before r is transcribed as[] by some transcribers and as [] by other tran-scribers, although they mean the same pronuncia-tion as appears from the introductions of the differ-ent atlas volumes.
A similar problem is found foroo before r which is transcribed either as  [] or[], and the eu before r which is transcribed as []or [].
Since similar problems may occur in othercontexts as well, the best solution to overcome allof these problems appeared to replace all []?s by[]?s, all []?s  by []?s, and all []?s by []?s, eventhough meaningful distinctions get lost.Especially suprasegmentals and diacritics mightbe used diffferently by the transcribers.
We processthe diacritics voiceless, voiced and nasal only.
Fordetails see Heeringa (2004, p. 110-111).The distance between a monophthong and adiphthong is calculated as the mean of the distancebetween the monophthong and the first element ofthe Institute of Pronunciation Sciences of theUniversity of Amsterdam and is available athttp://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat.36the diphthong and the distance between the mo-nophthong and the second element of the diph-thong.
The distance between two diphthongs iscalculated as the mean of the distance between thefirst elements and the distance between the secondelements.
Details are given in Heeringa (2004, p.108).4.2 Measuring divergence from the proto-languagesThe Levenshtein distance enables us to compareeach of the 360 Dutch dialects to PLR and PGD.Since we reconstructed 85 words, the distance be-tween a dialect and a proto-language is equal to theaverage of the distances of 85 word pairs.Figures 1 and 2 show the distances to PLR andPGD respectively.
Dialects with a small distanceare represented by a lighter color and those with alarge distance by a darker color.
In the map, dia-lects are represented by polygons, geographic dia-lect islands are represented by colored dots, andlinguistic dialect islands are represented by dia-monds.
The darker a polygon, dot or diamond, thegreater the distance to the proto-language.The two maps show similar patterns.
The dia-lects in the Northwest (Friesland), the West(Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht) and in themiddle (Noord-Brabant) are relatively close to theproto-languages.
More distant are dialects in theNortheast (Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel), in theSoutheast (Limburg), close to the middle part ofthe Flemish/Walloon border (Brabant) and in thesouthwest close to the Belgian/French state border(West-Vlaanderen).According to Weijnen (1966), the Frisian, Lim-burg and West-Flemish dialects are conservative.Our maps shows that Frisian is relatively close toproto-Germanic, but Limburg and West-Flemishare relatively distant.
We therefore created twomaps, one which shows distances to PGD based onvowel substitutions in stressed syllables only, andanother showing distances to PGD on the basis ofconsonant substitutions only.7Looking at the map based on vowel substitutionswe find the vowels of the Dutch province of Lim-burg and the eastern part of the province Noord-Brabant relatively close to PGD.
Looking at themap based on consonant substitutions we find theconsonants of the Limburg varieties distant to7The maps are not included in this paper.PGD.
The Limburg dialects have shared in theHigh German Consonant Shift.
Both the Belgiumand Dutch Limburg dialects are found east of theUerdinger Line between Dutch ik/ook/-lijk andHigh German ich/auch/-lich.
The Dutch Limburgdialects are found east of the Panninger Line be-tween Dutch sl/sm/sn/sp/st/zw and High Germanschl/schm/schn/schp/scht/schw (Weijnen 1966).The Limburg dialects are also characterized by theuvular [%] while most Dutch dialects have the al-veolar [].
All of this shows that Limburg conso-nants are innovative.The map based on vowel substitutions showsthat Frisian vowels are not particularly close toPGD.
Frisian is influenced by the Ingvaeonicsound shift.
Among other changes, the [] changedinto [], which in turn changed into [] in somecases (Dutch dun ?thin?
is Frisian tin) (Van Bree1987, p. 69).8 Besides, Frisian is characterized byits falling diphthongs, which are an innovation aswell.
When we consulted the map based on conso-nant substitutions, we found the Frisian consonantsclose to PGD.
For example the initial /g/ is stillpronounced as a plosive as in most other Germanicvarieties, but in Dutch dialects ?
and in  standardDutch ?
as a fricative.When we consider West-Flemish, we find thevowels closer to PGD than the consonants, butthey are still relatively distant to PGD.4.3 PLR versus PGDWhen correlating the 360 dialect distances to PLRwith the 360 dialect distances to PGD, we obtaineda correlation of r=0.87 (p<0.0001)9.
This is a sig-nificant, but not perfect correlation.
Therefore wecompared the word transcriptions of PLR withthose of PGD.8The Ingvaeonic sound shift affected mainly Frisianand English, and to a lesser degree Dutch.
Wemention here the phenomenon found in our datamost frequently.9For finding the p-values we used with thanks:VassarStats: Website for Statistical Computation at:http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html.37Figure 1.
Distances of 360 Dutch dialects com-pared to PLR.
Dialects are represented by poly-gons, geographic dialect islands are represented bycolored dots, and linguistic dialect islands are rep-resented by diamonds.
Lighter polygons, dots ordiamonds represent more conservative dialects anddarker ones more innovative dialects.First we focus on the reconstruction of vowels.We find 28 words for which the reconstructedvowel of the stressed syllable was the same as inPGD10.
In 15 cases, this was the result of applyingthe tendencies discussed in Section 2.1.
In 13 casesthis was the result of simply choosing the vowelfound most frequently among the 360 word pro-nunciations.
When we do not use tendencies, butsimply always choose the most frequent vowel, weobtain a correlation which is significantly lower(r=0.74, p=0).We found 29 words for which vowel was recon-structed different from the one in PGD, althoughthe PGD vowel was found among at least two dia-lects.
For 28 words the vowel in the PGD form wasnot found among the 360 dialects, or only onetime.
For 11 of these words, the closest vowelfound in the inventory of that word, was recon-structed.
For example the vowel in ook ?too?
is[] in PGD, while we reconstructed [	].10For some words PGD gives multiple pronunciations.We count the number of words which has the samevowel in at least one of the PGD pronunciations.Figure 2.
Distances of 360 Dutch dialects com-pared to PGD.
Dialects are represented by poly-gons, geographic dialect islands are represented bycolored dots, and linguistic dialect islands are rep-resented by diamonds.
Lighter polygons, dots ordiamonds represent more conservative dialects anddarker ones more innovative dialects.Looking at the consonants, we found 44 wordswhich have the same consonants as in PGD.11 For36 words only one consonant was different, wheremost words have at least two consonants.
Thisshows that the reconstruction of consonants worksmuch better than the reconstruction of vowels.5 ConclusionsIn this paper we tried to reconstruct a ?proto-language?
on the basis of the RND dialect materialand see how close we come to the protoformsfound in K?bler?s proto-Germanic dictionary.
Wereconstructed the same vowel as in PGD or theclosest possible vowel for 46% of the words.Therefore, the reconstruction of vowels still needsto be improved further.The reconstructions of consonants worked well.For 52% of the words all consonants reconstructedare the same as in PGD.
For 42% of the words,only one consonant was differently reconstructed.And, as a second goal, we measured the diver-gence of Dutch dialects compared to their proto-11When PGD has multiple pronunciations, we count thenumber of words for which the consonants are thesame as in at least one of the PGD pronunciations.38language.
We calculated dialect distances to PLRand PGD, and found a correlation of r=0.87 be-tween the PLR distances and PGD distances.
Thehigh correlation shows the relative influence ofwrongly reconstructed sounds.When we compared dialects to PLR and PGD,we found especially Frisian close to proto-Germanic.
When we distinguished between vowelsand consonants, it appeared that southeastern dia-lects (Dutch Limburg and the eastern part ofNoord-Brabant) have vowels close to proto-Germanic.
Frisian is relatively close to proto-Germanic because of its consonants.AcknowledgementsWe thank Peter Kleiweg for letting us use the pro-grams which he developed for the representation ofthe maps.
We would like to thank Prof. GerhardK?bler for the use of his neuhochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch and his explanationabout this dictionary and Gary Taylor for his ex-planation about proto-Germanic pronunciation.
Wealso thank the members of the Groningen Dialec-tometry group for useful comments on a earlierversion of this paper.
We are grateful to theanonymous reviewers for their valuable sugges-tions.
