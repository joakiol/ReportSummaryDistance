A High-level Morphological Description LanguageExploiting Inflectional ParadigmsPeter Anick and Suzanne ArtemieffDigital Equipment Corporation111 Locke Drive, LMO2d/DI2Marlboro, MA 01752anick@aiag.enet.dec.cnmAbstractA high-level language lor the description of inflectionalmorphology is presented, in which the organization ofword lormation rules into an ii~herilance hierarchy ofparadigms allows lo ra  natural encoding of the kinds ofnfles typically pre~uted in grammar txroks.
We showhow tim language, composed of orthographic rides, wordformation rules, and paradigm inheritance, can be com-piled into a run-time data structure for efficient morpho-logical analysis and generation with a dynamic secondarystorage lexicon.1 IntroductionPedagogical grmnmar Nalks typically organize their de-scriptinns of the inflectiomd morphology of a langtmge interms of paradigms, groups of rnlas which characterizethe inflectional behavior of some subset of the language'svocabulary.
A French grannnar may divide verbs into thefirst, secoud, and third conjugations; German grammarsspeak of "weak" and "strong" verbs; Spanish grammarsclassify verbs by their infiuitival endings, etc.
The familynf word forms that each v(x:abuhu'y item may have canthus he describexl by a combination of a ba~ stem (suchas the "citation lbrm" used to index words in a dictionary)and the paradigm the word belongs to.
Irregular words,which exhibit belu~viors not completely captured by gen-eral paradigms, often tend to be partially describable byreference to regular parudigmatic patterns.The word formation rules that comprise a paradigm areusually expressed in terms of a sequence of stem changeand affixation operations.
For example, one French text-Imok \[NEBEL741, in describing first conjugation verbs,shows how to fi)rm present tense forms nsing the inliniti-val stem with its "er" suffix rmnoved.
Future tense istormed by appending ',fffixes to the fifll infinitival stem,while the stem of the imperfect tense is Ionnd by takingthe first person plural of the present ense and droppingthe "ons".
Ill addition to such word formation roles, thereare spelling change rules wbich describe variations illspelling, often ctmditioned by file phonologic~d or ortho-graphic ontext h which a word lbrnlation rule is applied.While the above characterization f morphological behav-ior is a huniliar oue, inost description languages that havebeen developed for cumputatioual morphology (e.g., IKC)-SKENNIEMI841, \[G(}RZ881 ) have tended to locus moreon the orthographic and of fixation rules, and pay less at-tention to explicitly captaring the regularities within andbetween parudignts.
Recently, some researchers have be-gun exploring the advantages to be derived from a nora.tion in which paradigms play a more central role (e.g.,\[CALDER891.
IRUSSELL911).
This paper presents ucha notation, called PDL (for Paradigm Description l.au-guage), which we are using as the basis of the morpho-logical an~dyzer for A1-STARS, a multi-lingual "lexicon-assisted" informatiml retrieval system (\[ANICK901).
Ithas been a goal of our high-level language design to pre-~rve, as umch as possible, the kinds of descriptive de-vices traditiorually used in grammar books.Our approach to the representation f pmacfigms borrowsfrom the Artificial Intelligence cmnmunity's notion of"frames", data structures made up (ff slots with attachedprocedares, orgmlized hierarchically to snpport defaultslot inheritance and overtkles (e.g., \[BOBROW771).
In aparadigm's "frume", the slots correspond to surlace antistem li)nns, whose values are either explicitly stoxvd (inthe lexicon) or else computed by word formation rules.The hierarchical organization of paradigms helps to cap-tore the sharexl linguistic behaviors among classes ofwords in all explicit and concise mlnnler.Our ;qlplicatiou domain introdnces several constraints onthe design of its morphological component:- The morphological recognizer must work with a dy-namic secondary storage lexicnn access~xl via an in-dex on stem tornls.

We havebuilt t~firly complete representations h)r English, French,and Gennan, and have begun invcsfigating Spanish.While it is premature to predict how well our approachwill apply across the range of European langnages, wehave fimnd it contains a nnmher of desirable aspects forapplications such as AI-STARS.in the next section, we provide an overview of the PDLhmguage, describing how word fonnation rules are organ-ized into a hierarchy of paradigms and how the lexiconand morphological rules interact.
Then we provide an il-lustration of the use of paradigm inheritance to construct aconcise encoding of French verb forms.
Next we presentalgorithms for the compilation of PDL rote efficient run-time data structures, and lot the recognition and genera-tion of word fi)rms.
We conclude with an evaluation ofthe strengths anti weaknesses of rite approach, and areasfor future research.2 Paradigm Description LanguageOar paradigm description language (PDL) is composcd ofthree major components - form rules, an inheritance hier-archy of paradigms, and orthographic rules.2.1 Form RulesWe divide word lorms into?
surface forms, which are those that show tip in atext,?
lexical forms, which are those that are stored di-rectly in the lexicon, and?
intermediate forms, those forms created by affixa-tion or stem-change operations applied to otherlorms.
These terms may not ever show up in a textbut are useful in describing intermediate steps in theconstruction of surlhce lorms from lexical fi)rms.In the form ennstruction rules, we distinguish betweentwo major categories of strings.
Stems are any formswhich include the primary \[exical base of tile word,whereas affixes comprise tile prefixes and suffixes whichcan be concatenated with a stein in the process of wordformation.
Once an affix is appended to or removed froma stem, the result is also a stem, since tire result also in-cludes the primary lexical base.
Form construction rides,are restrictexl to the five cases below:?
<form> : <stem> +<affix>?
<form> : <stem> - <affix>?
<form> : + <affix> <stem>?
<form>: - <affix> <stem>?
<forul> : <stein>The <lotto> is a name for the string form created by therule.
<stem> is the name of a stein form.
<affix> may bea prefix or suffix string (or string variable), its type (i.c.,prefix or suffix) impliexl by its position before or after the<stcm> in the rulc.
The operator (+ or -) always precexlesthe affix.
If +, then the affix is appended to the stem as aprefix or suffix.
If -, then the affix is removexl from thestem.
The rest,lting <lorm> name may in turn be used asa stem in the consU'uction el some other k}rm.
In thisway, the construction of a surface form may be describedvia a succession of affixatinn or stem-change operations,each operation described in a single rule.The special syndml LEX may be used in the right-hand-side of a form rule to imlicate that the tonn is stored as alexical stem in the lexicon.Grammatical \[~ttures may be associated with form names,as follows:<form> \[<feature> = <vahte>,<feature> = <value>, ...\]2.2 ParadigmsA paradigm in PDL is composed of a set of term con-struction rules which collectively characterize the filmilyof surface forms for those words which belong tn thatparadigm.
To capture the similarities among paradigmsand to avoid redundancy in the description of a language,we allow one paradigm to be based on another paradigm.If paradigm B is based on paradigm A, then all the fimnsand fi)rm construction rules that have been defined R)rparadigm A also apply, by default, to paradigm B. Wecan then differentiate paradigm B ti'om A in three ways:I.
We can add new lorms and their conslrnction rulesfi~r tbrms that do not exist in A.ACN-~S DE COLING-92, NAiVFES, 23-28 AO6"r 1992 6 8 PREC.

Likewise, air ab-stract paradigm nlay itself be based on yet another ab-stract (or concrete) paradigm.The ability to base one paradignl on another, combinedwith the ability to represent intermediate stenl forms ;ISslols in a paradigm, is a very lXlwerful feature of our mor-phological description langnage.

The con-catenation or removal of all affix may in some cases resultill fl spoiling change other than tile mere concatenation orremoval of tile affix string.
In English, inany words end-ing in a vowel followed by a consonant will donble the fi-nal consonant whml an affix starting with a vowel is ap-pended, ill French, the addition of certain affixes requiresthat ;in "e" in the stein of some verbs be rewritten as "~,".Since these spelling change rules ;ire often hased on gen-eral phonological/orthographic llroperties nf alfixes andsteins, rather lhnn llle specific forln rules Ihe, lnsolvos, andhmlce may apply acrnss paradigms, we supllort the m?le-poudent st?~cificatinn of spelling rules caplnring lhesochanges.
Each rnle is written to allply to the orthographiccontext of a slen/and affix at tile point el the concatena-tion or deletion opontiion.
Thus, there ;ire two kinds ofspelling rules:1, Suffix rules, which describe spelling changes ap-plying to the end of tile stem and the hoginnmg ofthe snffix, and2.

AUG. 23-28, 1992This is a suffix rule, since the operator precedes the sec-ond left-hand-side pattern.
Accordingly, the <stem-pattern> refers to the characters at the end of the stemwhile the <affix-pattern> refers to the letters at the begin-ning of the affix.
This rule states that, if we are append-ing an affix which begins with a vowel to a stem whichends in the character "a" followed by two identical conso-nants, then we construct he resulting form (<merged-pattern>) as follows:1.
Remove the last three characters from the stem,leaving <sub-stem>.2.
Remove the first character f om the suffix, leaving<sub-allix>.3.
Construct the string <spell-change> by concatenat-ing the strings and iastantiated character variablesdescribed by the right-hand-side pattern.4.
Construct he resulting form as the concatenationof the strings <sub-stem>, <spell-change>, and<sub-affix>.2.4 The LexiconWe have seen above how one paradigm can be based onanother, thereby allowing lorm conslruction roles to be"inherited" by paradigms.
This inherit~mce is controlledthrough the form names themselves.
If we have a para-digm B based on paradigm A, then any form rules in Afor which there is no rule in B with the same form nameare by detroit assumed to be part of paradigm B.Although onr lexicon is maintained as a secondary storagedatabase with entries represented and indexed differentlyfrom the (memory resident) paradigms, it is useful tothink of a lexical entry as "inheriting" rules from its para-digm ~ts well.
The inflectional behavior of any individnalword will depend on both the information inherited fromits paradigm and the information stored in the lexicon.Lexicon entries contain the equivalent of a single kind ofform construction rule:<fi)rm> : <stem>/{ supersede I augment}The interaction of lexical information with the word'sp~tradigm is as fi)llows:?
If <form> correspends to a lexical stem nile in theparadigm (i.e., one whose right-hand-side is thespecial symbol LEX), then this form provides thestem fi)r that rule.?
If <form> correspomLs to a surface form in theparadigm or an iutermediate form qualified with thequalifier/allow lexical override , then the lcxicalfornl either supersedes or augments the consU'nc-tion rule in the paradigm, depending on the value ofthe stem's /\[supersede I augment} qualifier.The qualifier/allow_lexical override is necessary to in-form the run-time inflectional analyzer when to attempt alexical lookup of an intermediate form stem.
By default,the analyzer looks up any form found directly in the text(surface form) and any forms whose right hand side isLEX.
The use of the /allow lexical override flag cansave disk accesses by limiting lexical lookups of interme-diate forms to just those cases in which lexical overridesmay actually occur.Utilizing the/allow lexical_override qualifier and the de-fault lookup of suri~,ce forms, one could write lexical en-tries in which all the rules in a paradigm were overriddenby lexical information.
In general, this is not a good idea,since it fails to take advantage of the generalizations thatparadigms provide, but there are exceptional cases, suchas the verb "be", fl~r which there must necessarily be alarge number of lexical stems.
Allowing lexical overridesin this manner eliminates the need to create tm excessivenumber of highly idiosyncratic paradigms specifically toaccomodate irregular verbs in languages like French andGerman (see section 3).3 Using Paradigm Inheritance to CaptureLinguistic GeneralizationsIn PDL, word formation is characterized asa sequence ofdiscrete transformational steps, lu many cases, paradigms(as well as iudividual exical items) will differ with re-spect o one or more of these intermediate steps, yet sharethe bulk of the rules that apply to the results of the inter-mediate operations.
Default inheritance, including the in-heritance of the partially derived forms, makes it possibleto express uch facts very succinctly.
Figure I depicts thehierarchy of paradigms we have developed for the Frenchverbs.
The root of the hierarchy (VERBROOT) repre-sents the "greatest common denominator" of all the para-digms in the hierarchy.
(All of the inteianediate formrules in the root paradigm are shown in Figure 1, butmany of the surface form rules are omitted because ofspace limitations.
However, all of the form rules, both in-termediate and surface, in the other paradigms are listed.
)The first sub-paradigm, VERB ER, represents wlmt arecommonly referred to ,as first conjugation verbs,VERB_IR represents the second conjugation, andVERB_RE_IR, VERB OIR, and VERBRE together rep-resent he third conjugation, which includes virtually all ofthe "irregular" verbs.\[BESCHERELLE90\] describes over 70 conjugation typesthat fall within one of the three basic groups, the thirdgroup being subdivided iuto three sections, one for the ir-regular verbs ending in -ir, one tier the -oir verbs and onefor the -re verbs.
These sections map directly onto para-A?_'TES DI,: COLING-92, NAI'CrHS, 23-28 Aotrr 1992 7 0 PROC.

RE IR, VERB OIR, and VERBRE,  re-spectively,  with the exception of several types (which ac-tually fit VERBROOT directly.)
Through the use ofform rule inheritance, intermediate form odes, lexicaloverride and orthographic rules, we arc able to condensethe rules for the 78 types into these six paradigms, whichcapture in a straightforward way most of the linguisticregularities within and among the paradigms.The useful role played by intermediate form rides in in-heritance can be seen by comparing the VERB ER andVERB IR paradigms.
Both share (inherit) the imp inter-mediate form and the set of six surface forms that do-scribe the imperfect tense (e.g., imp Is).
However, theydiffer in the siirface lbrm prt~s_lp, which is overridden inVERB IR, and in the interlnediate form bllse, which isoverridden in VERB_ER.
The interesting point here isthat even though the imperfect indicative tetras employthe stein imp, a form that is generated from a form that isnot shared (prOs lp) and wliich is in turn generated froman unshared form (base), both the imp stem ~md the set ofimperfect indicative forms may still be shared.Another example of how ovcrridable intermediate fonnniles can be used to condense paradiguls is provided bythe VERB_RE IR paradignt (which handles all of the ir-regular verbs ending in -it that behave nlore like the -reverbs, e.g., dormir and v~tir) and its sub-paradigms.
Thisis accomplished by first defining a new intermediate form,prl~s_s, which may be oveIliden by a lexical entry (orstem change rule).
This ,,dlows for au irregular stem in thesingular fonns of the present indicative (e.g., dormir ->dot.
mouvoir -> meu) whilc lint overriding the baseform, which is used elsewhere.
Secoudly, allowing lexi-cal override of the stems used to generate the fliture andt)res, ent conditional tense forms (fur) and the past simpleand impedcct subjunctivc terms (pas), respectively, al-lows for irregular stems such as valoir --> vaudr (fur) antimouvoir --> mu (pas).We have found this combination of intermediate formniles and lexical override uscful for defining paradignisfor Gemlan verbs as well.

First, the form rulesarc chained into a network based on the form i}antcs ap-pearing in the rules' left aud right hand sides.
The full setel  paradigms u) which each form lule applies is calculatedand stored ;.it each corresponding node in the network.Then the orthographic rules are conftated with lhe wordformatirnl rules by unifying tile orthographic patterns withtile affixes th the form rules, Finally, a character dis-crimination et is constructed front all suffix surface lormrules to optimize tile rul}-linlc inatehing of the outermostsuffix patterns in the form rule transition et.During morphological nalysis, tile conflated patterns arcmatched against he input string and the string undergoeswhatever Iranslormation tile correspontling word lk}rma-tion rule diclates.
At each step through the network, theset of paradigms for which that step is valid is intersectedwith the set that has been valid tip to that point in the deri-vation.
If this intersection becomes NULL, then the pathis abanthmed as iuvalid.

Lexicou Iookups of candidate stem stringsoccur only when a I,EX node or node marked ;is Icxicallyoverritkthle is reached.
If a lexical stein matching thefern} mune, paradigm set, and tcaturc onstrnints acquiredfrom the uet is found, then its len}lna is returned.For generation, the traversal is reversed, llowever, m or-tier to calcuhtte the sequence uf rules to traverse tu gener-ate a surface lorm, we must work backwards from the nilethat prty.luces the desired surtitce form (given the para-digm of tile lemma) to the rule that precedes that rule, ands(I on, untd we reach a lorm whose stem is salted with thelemma in the lexicon.
At this point, we know both theproper starting lexical stem li)rm and tile sequence nfrules to apply to that stem.5 DiscussionA number of researchers have proposed tile use of tither\[-lance in representing aspects of natural language (e.g.,\[IIUDSON841, \[EVANS891 IDAELEMANS9I)I,\[PUSTEJOVSKY91\]).
The wnrk described here is mostsimilar in spirit to the wurk of \[CALDER89} and \[R/JS-SELL91\], who also al)ply principles of del;casible inheri-lance to 111e domain of conllltltational morphology, Cal-dot's word Rmnation rules make use of string equations,an elegant and powerful tlechtrative device which, whilemore expressive than our (deliberately) conslrainetl wm'dlbnnatioa nd orthographic rules, may bc less amenable toefficient compilation anti appears geared towards an th-memory lexicon.
By di~llowing recursion in our formrules, limiting each form rule to at most one affixatkm op-eration, and encoding directionality within our nrthtl-graphic patterns, wc are able to cOral)lie rules into transi-tion networks in a swaightforward manner, reducing theneed for extensive run-time unification.
In oar experienceto date, these language limitations have m)t interfered wilt}the concise capture of morphological behavior.
Indeed,our separation of orthographic rules and fonn talcs allowsus to capture orthographic gmtcralizatimts hat Calder(1989) canm)t. Furthermore, whereas Calder's system"disallows the possibility of inheritance of partial derivedstring forms," we have found that the thheritanee of inter-mediate stmns contributes considerably to the descriptivepower of our h}rmalism.Russell ct al (\[RUSSELL911) have tlevelnpctl languageextensions to the PATR II style aniiicatiou grammar Ibr-realism which allow lot multiple defanlt inheritance in thedescription of lexical entries.
Multil)le inheritance is auseful tool fur partitioning syntactic, semantic, and mor-phological classes el behavior.
However, while we haveencountered occasional cases iu which a word appears toderive variants Item multil)le paradigms, we have so f,'~rnpted to preserve the simplicity ol a single itthcritance hi-erarchy in PDL, utilizing extra lexical stems to accomo-date such variants when they arise.Byrd and Tzoukermann (\[BYRD881) nolo that IheirFrench word grammar contains 165 verb stem rules andanother 110 affix rules; and they question the rehltivevalue nf storing rules versus inflected Iorms.
This is aconcern of ours as well, as we wish to minimize the num-ber of run-time "\[~dse alan'as", lXltential stems generatedduring morpl}ological nalysis which do not actually existin the lexicon.
Our mlxtel of the French verb inflectionsuses 81 form rules and 17 orthogml}hic rules.
We havetried to tlesign our paradigms to minimize the numtxzr ofinflected stems that must be stored m the lexicon, while atthe same time avoiding roles that woukl conlribnte to aprolit)ration (ff false alarms during analysis.
We 1)clievethat the use of lexically overridable intermediate ff)rms isa key to strikiug this balance.For the purtx}se n\[ acquiring moqthnlogical informationabout unknown words m a coqms, however, it is useful tnhave a single canonical furm (citation lorm) t~)r each para-dignl, from which all inflected fornls in the paradignt canbe derived.
Thus we have opted to extend our languagewith the notkm el "acquisition-only" paradigms.
Theseparadigu/s are essentially tile saute as those used for rec-ognition; however, they include extra form rules (typicallysiren change rules) to reduce all lexical steins wilhth aAclIis m!

Modeling tile stem changes revolvingGerman "l.lmlantmtg" (FI'ROST90\]) has required tbc a{l-dition of a variable mappiug function to tile spccificatinnof orthographic rales.
German separablc prefixes are han-dled via tile use of an affix variable, which retains tilevalue of the separable prefix for later unificalion with tileseparable-pretix fcature of potential lexical stems.
Ger-inatl conlpounding renlains impossible to capture witllinour current I{)rlrl rules, as they are, constrained to a single<stenr> component.
While we expect {} store nlost COlO-ponnds directly in Ihc lexicon, we arc looking rote henris-tics Ibr analyzing componnds that minimize the numberof probes needed into our secondary slorage lexicon.6 ConclusionsOur experience so far with PDL bas suplxnted our hy-pofllesis that organizing moq}lllllogical behavior in termsof hierarchically related inflectiomd pamdignls belps toexplicitly characterize tile similarities and differencesamong classes of words an{I makes it easier tl} capture in aCOIICISB and transparent lallller tile kinds of word fornla-tion rules describ{xt iu many gralninar books.
The lan-guage Call be compiled into a form anlenable to efficieutanalysis and generation with a dynamic secondary Stl}ragelexiclm, Future work includes further "tuumg" of existingndesets, extending our coverage of European languages,and interfacing the inflectional system with roles {}f {led-vational moq)hology and compouuding.Aeknowledl~ementsThe anthers gratefully acknllwledge tile invaluable ass{s-lance of Alain Couillanlt, Ilcngfimeh Irandoust, andMichael Carl ill developing rammars \]i}r I:rench andGerman.
