SOAT: A Semi-Automatic Domain Ontology Acquisition Toolfrom Chinese CorpusShih-Hung WUInstitute of Information ScienceAcademia SinicaNankang, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.shwu@iis.sinica.edu.twWen-Lian HSUInstitute of Information ScienceAcademia SinicaNankang, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.hsu@iis.sinica.edu.twAbstractIn this paper, we focus on the domain ontologyacquisition from Chinese corpus by extractingrules designed for Chinese phrases.
These rulesare noun sequences with part-of-speech tags.Experiments show that this process can constructdomain ontology prototypes efficiently andeffectively.1.
IntroductionDomain ontology is important for large-scalenatural language application systems such asspeech recognition (Flett & Brown 2001),question answering (QA), knowledgemanagement and organization memory(KM/OM), information retrieval, machinetranslation (Guarino 1998), and grammarchecking systems (Bredenkamp 2000).
With thehelp of domain ontology, software systems canperform better in understanding natural language.However, building domain ontology is laboriousand time consuming.Previous works suggest that ontologyacquisition is an iterative process which includeskeyword collection as well as structurereorganization.
The ontology will be revised,refined, and filled in detail during iteration.
(Noyand McGuinness 2001) For example (Hearst1992), in order to find a hyponym of a keyword,the human editor must observe sentencescontaining this keyword and its relatedhyponyms.
The editor then deduces rules forfinding more hyponyms of this keyword.
Assuch cycle iterates, the editor refines the rules toobtain better quality pairs of keyword-hyponyms.In this work we try to speed up the abovelabor-intensive approach by designingacquisition rules that can be applied recursively.A human editor only has to verify the results ofthe acquisition.The extraction rules we specified are templatesof part-of-speech (POS) tagged phrase structure.Parsing a phrase by POS tags (Abney 1991) is awell-known shallow parsing technique, whichprovides the natural language processingfunction for different natural languageapplications including ontology acquisition(Maedche and Staab 2000).In previous works (Hsu et al 2001), we haveconstructed a knowledge representationframework, InfoMap, to integrate variouslinguistic knowledge, commonsense knowledgeand domain knowledge.
InfoMap is designed toperform natural language understanding.
It hasbeen applied to many application domains, suchas QA system and KM/OM (Wu et al 2002) andhas obtained encouraging results.
An importantcharacteristic of InfoMap is to extract eventsfrom a sentence by capturing the topic words,usually noun-verb (NV) pairs or noun-noun (NN)pairs, which is defined in domain ontology.
Wedesign the SOAT as a semi-automatic domainontology acquisition tool following the ontologyframework, InfoMap.We shall review the InfoMap ontologyframework in section 2.
The domain ontologyacquisition process and extraction rules will bediscussed in Section 3.
Experimental results arereported in section 4.
We conclude our work inSection 5.2.
The InfoMap FrameworkGruber defines an ontology to be a descriptionof concepts and relationships (Gruber 1993).Our knowledge representation scheme, InfoMap,can serve as an ontology framework.
InfoMapprovides the knowledge necessary forunderstanding natural language related to acertain knowledge domain.
Thus, we need tointegrate various linguistic knowledge,commonsense knowledge and domainknowledge in making inferences.2.1 The Structure of InfoMapInfoMap consists of domain concepts and theirassociated attributes, activities, etc., which areits related concepts.
Each of the concepts formsa tree-like taxonomy.
InfoMap defines?reference?
nodes to connect nodes on differentbranches, thereby integrating these concepts intoa semantic network.InfoMap not only classifies concepts, but alsoclassifies the relationships among concepts.There are two types of nodes in InfoMap:concept nodes and function nodes.
The rootnode of a domain is the name of the domain.Following the root node, topics are found in thisdomain that may be of interest to users.
Thesetopics have sub-categories that list relatedsub-topics in a recursive fashion.2.2 Function Nodes in InfoMapInfoMap uses function nodes to label differentrelationships among related concept nodes.
Thebasic function nodes are: category, attribute,synonym, and activity, which are describedbelow.1.
Category: Various ways of dividing up aconcept A.
For example, for the concept of?people?, we can divide it into young, mid-ageand old people according to ?age?.
Anotherway is to divide it into men and womenaccording to ?sex?, or rich and poor peopleaccording to ?wealth?, etc.
For each suchpartition, we shall attach a ?cause?.
Each suchdivision can be regarded as an angle ofviewing concept A.2.
Attribute: Properties of concept A. Forexample, the attributes of a human being canbe the organs, the height, the weight, hobbies,etc.3.
Associated activity: Actions that can beassociated with concept A.
For example, if A isa ?car?, then it can be driven, parked, raced,washed, repaired, etc.4.
Synonym: Expressions that are synonymousto concept A in the context.2.3 The Contextual View of InfoMapGenerally speaking, an ontology consists ofdefinitions of concepts, relations and axioms.
Awell known ontology, WordNet (Miller 1990),has the following features: hypernymy,hyponymy, antonymy, semantic relationship,and synset.
Comparing with the globlal view ofconcepts in WordNet, InfoMap defines category,event, atttibute, and synonym in a morecontextual fashion.
For example, the synonym ofa concept in InfoMap is valid only in thisparticular context.
This is very different from thesynset in WordNet.
Each node B underneath afunction node (synonym, attribute, activity orcategory) of A can be treated as a related conceptof A and can be further expanded by describingother relations pertaining to B.
However, therelations for B described therein will be ?limitedunder the context of A?.
For example, if A is?organization?
and B is the ?facility?
attribute ofA, then underneath the node B we shall list thosefacilities one can normally find in anorganization, whereas for the ?facility?
attributeof ?hotel?, we shall only list those existingfacilities in hotel.2.4 The Inference Engine of InfoMapThe kernel program can map a natural languagesentence into a set of nodes and uses the editedknowledge to recognize the events in the user?ssentences.
Technically, InfoMap matches anatural language sentence to a collection ofconcept notes.
There is a firing mechanism thatfinds nodes in InfoMap relevent to the inputsentence.
Suppose we want to find the event ofthe following sentence: ?How do I invest instocks??
and the interrogative word ?how?
canfire the word ?method?.
Then along the pathfrom ?method?
to ?stock?
the above sentencehas fired the concepts ?stock?
and ?invest?.Thus, the above sentence will correspond to thepath:stock - event - invest - attribute - methodGiven enough knowledge about the eventsrelated to the main concept, InfoMap can beused to parse Chinese sentences.
Readers canrefer to (Hsu et al 2001) for a thoroughdescription of InfoMap.3.
Automatic Domain Ontology AcquisitionTo build an ontology for a new domain, we needto collect domain keywords and find therelationships among them.
An acquisitionprocess, SOAT, is designed that can construct anew ontology through domain corpus.
Thus,with little human intervention, SOAT can builda prototype of the domain ontology.As described in previous sections, InfoMapconsists of two major relations among concepts,i.e., Taxonomic relations (category and synonym)and Non-taxonomic relations (attribute andevent).
We defined sentence templates, whichconsists of patterns of keywords and variables,to capture these relations.3.1 Description of SOATGiven the domain corpus with the POS tag, ourSOAT can be described as follows.Input: domain corpus with the POS tagOutput: domain ontology prototypeSteps:1 Select a keyword (usually the name of thedomain) in the corpus as the seed to forma potential root set R2 Begin the following recursive process:2.1 Pick a keyword A as the root from R2.2 Find a new related keyword B of the rootA by extraction rules and add it into thedomain ontology according to the rules.2.3 If there is no more related keywords,remove A from R2.4 Put B into the potential root set2.5 Repeat step 2, until either R becomesempty or the total number of nodesgenerated exceeds a prescribed threshold.We find that most of the domain keywords arenot in the dictionary.
So the traditional TF/IDFmethod would fail.
Instead, we use the highfrequency new words discovered by PAT-tree asthe seeds.
Ideally, SOAT can generate andomain ontology prototype automatically.However, the extraction rules need to be refinedand updated by a human editor.
The details ofSOAT extraction rules are in Section 3.2.3.2 The Extraction Rules of SOATThe extraction rules in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4,consists of a specific noun as the root, and thePOS tags of the neighboring words.
A rule is alinguistic template for finding keywords relatedto the root.
The target of extraction is usually aword or a compound word, which has strongsemantic links to the root.
Our rules areespecially effective in identifying essentialcompound words for a specific domain.We use POS tags defined by CKIP (CKIP 1993),in which Na is the generic noun, Nb is theproper noun, and Nc is the toponym.
Generally,an Na can be a subject or an object in a sentence,including concrete noun and abstract noun, suchas ?cloth?, ?table?, ?tax?, and ?technology?.
AnNc is the name of a place.
Readers can refer toCKIP (CKIP 1993) for more information aboutthe POS tag.
In our experiment, we focus on Naand Nc, because the topics that we are interestedin usually fall in these two categories.
Theextraction rules of finding categorical (taxonomy)relationships from a given Na (or Nc) are inTable 1 (and 3).
The rules of finding attribute(non-taxonomy) relationships from a given Na(or Nc) are in Table 2 (and 4).Table 1.

DiscussionLi and Thompson (1981) describe MandarinChinese as a Topic-prominent language in whichthe subject or the object is not as obvious as inother languages.
Therefore, the highly preciseshallow parsing result (Munoz et al 1999) onNN and SV pairs in English is probably notapplicable to Chinese.4.1 The Experiment of Extraction RateTo test the qualitative and quantitativeperformance of SOAT, we design twoexperiments.
We construct three domainontology prototypes for three different domainsand corpora.
Table 5 shows the result in whichthe frequently asked questions (FAQs) for stocksare taken from test sentences of the financial QAsystem.
The university and bank corpora arecollected from the CKIP corpus (CKIP 1995).We select sentences containing the keyword?University?
or ?Bank?
as the domain corpora.The results in Table 5 show that SOAT cancapture related keywords and the relationshipsamong them from limited sentences veryefficiently without using the frequency.Table 5.

domain.The first corpus is a collection of FAQ sentencesabout computer network.
The second corpus is acollection of sentences containing the keyword?network?
from the CKIP corpus.
The thirdcorpus is the collection of sentences fromWindows 2000 online help document.
To reducethe cost of human verification, we limit the sizeof corpus to 275 sentences.
The result in Table 6shows that there is a trade-off betweenextraction rate and the accuracy rate.Table 6.

On the other hand,with the help of SOAT, a knowledgeable editorcan edit on the average 4 categories, 25attributes and 42 activities that SOAT extracted.The quantity is estimated on 4*(25+42)=268FAQ query concepts at least.
Thus, theproductivity of using SOAT is approximated268% times.
It is obvious that SOAT can helpreducing the cost of building a new domainontology.5.
ConclusionWe present a semi-automatic process of domainontology acquisition from domain corpus.
Theontology schema we used is general enough fordifferent applications and specific enough for thetask of understanding the Chinese naturallanguage.
The main objective of the research is toextract useful relationships from domain articlesto construct domain ontology prototypes in asemi-automatic fashion.
The SOAT extractionrules we developed can identify keywords withstrong semantic links, especially those compoundwords in the domain.We have discussed how to extract related NNpairs in Section 3 for SOAT.
However, theextraction rules for NN pairs do not apply for NVpairs.
In the future we shall follow the approachin (Tsai et al 2002) to extract the relationshipsbetween nouns and its related verbs.The main restriction of SOAT is that the qualityof the corpus must be very high, namely, thesentences are accurate and abundant enough toinclude most of the important relationships to beextracted.ReferencesAbney, S.P.
