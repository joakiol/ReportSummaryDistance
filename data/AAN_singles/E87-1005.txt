A MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSOR FOR MODERN GREEKAngela Ralli- Universit~ de Montreal, Montreal,Quebec, Canada- EUROTRA - GR,Athens, GreeceEleni Galiotou- National Documentation Center Prj.,National Hellenic Research Foundation,Athens, Greece- EUROTRA - GR,Athens, GreeceABSTRACTIn this paper, we present a morphological pro-cessor for Modern Greek.From the linguistic point of view, we tr 5, toelucidate the complexity of the inflectional sy-stem using a lexical model which follows themecent work by Lieber, 1980, Selkirk 1982, Kipar-sky 1982, and others.The implementation is based on the concept of"validation grammars" (Coumtin 1977).The morphological processing is controlled by afinite automaton and it combinesa.
a dictionary containing the stems for arepresentative fragment of Modern Greek and allthe inflectional affixes withb.
a grammar which camries out the transmis-sion of the linguistic information needed for theprocessing.
The words are structured by concate-nating a stem with an inflectional part.
In cer-tain cases, phonological rules are added to thegrammar in order to capture lexical phonologicalphenomena.i.
Intu'oduction-OvemviewOur processor is intended to provide an analy-sis as well as a generation for every derived itemof the greek lexicon.
It covers both inflectionaland derivational morphology but for the timebeing only inflection has been treated.Greek is the only language tested so far.Nevertheless, we hope that our system is generalenough to be of use to other languages since theformal and computational aspect of "validationgrammars" and finite automata has already beenused for French (c.f.
Courtin et al 1976, Galio-tou 1983).The system is built around the following datafiles:I.A "dictionary" holding morphemes associated tomorpho-syntactic information.2.A "model" file containing items which act asreference to every morphematic entry in order todetermine what kind of process the entry under-goes.3.A word grammar which governs permissible wordstructures.
The rules that can apply to an entryare divided ina.
a "basic initial rule" acting as a recogni-tion process.b.
The validation Pules that determine allpossible combinations of the entry with othermorphemes.4.
A list of phonemes described as sets of featu-res.
The same file contains also a set of phonolo-gical rules generating lexical phonological phe-nomena.
These rules govern permissible correspon-dences between the form of entries listed in thedictionary and the form they develop when theyare combined in sequences of morphemes.These files are used both for analysis and ge-neration.
The process of the present morphologicalanalysis consists of parsing an input of inflectedwords with respect to the word grammar.
Stemsassociated to the appropriate morpho-syntactic in-formation will be the output of the parsing.The process of generation of a given inflectedword consists ofa.
determining its stem by a morphologicalanalysis.b.
Generating all or a subset of the permis-sible word forms.For the needs of this presentation, lexicalitems have been transcribed in a semi-phonologicalmanner.
According to this transcription,all greekvowels written as double character are kept assuch:(1) Gmaphemes Phonemeso~ ~ oi~u ~ aiOH ~ oyMoreover, the sounds \[i\] and \[o~ written in Greekas n and ~ respectively are transcribed as i:and o:.
The transcription of the last two vowelsreminds of their ancient greek status as longvowels.As far as accent is concerned, we decided toexclude this aspect from the present form of theprocessor.
Accentuation in Greek is a linguisticproblem which has not been solved as yet.
We areworking on this matter and we hope to implementaccent in the near future.The morphological processing is controlled bya finite automaton I with the help of the dictio-T--F~r-a detailed discussion on the control auto-maton, c.f.Courtin et al1969.26namy and the word grammar which controls word for-marion and carries out the transmission of Thelinguistic information needed for the processing.In certain cases, the gPammar makes use of phono-logical rules in order To capture lexlcal phonolo-gical phenomena such as insertion, deletion andchange.The processor is implemented in TURBO-PROLO~(version 1.0) running under MS-DOS (version 3.10)on an IBM-XT with 640 kB main memory.
It consistsof an analysis and a generation sub-module.2.
Linguistic assumptionsThe theoPetical fPamework underlying thelinsuistic aspects of the project is that of Gene-rative Morphology, in particular the recent workby Lieber 1980, Selkirk 1982, Kiparsky 1982 andothers.In developing our system, we have adopted theproposals made in Ralli's study on Greek Morpholo-gY (Ph.D.diss., 1987).
Therefore, we assume thatthe greek lexicon contains a list of entries(dictionary) and a grammap which combines morpholo-gy with phonology.
The dictionary is morphemebased.
It contains stems and affixes which apeassociated with the following infor~nation fields.a.
The string in its basic phonological form.b.
Reference to possible allomorphic varia-tions of The string which are not productively ge-nerated by rule.c.
Specifications of grammatical category andother morpho-syntactic features that characterizethe particular entries.d.
The meaning.e.
Diacritic marks which are integers permit-ring the correct mapping between the stem and theaffix where this cannot be done by rule.
(i) Stem Affixvivli 3 + o 3 "book" (neut, nom,sg)krat 4 ?
os 4 "state" (neuT,nom,sg)In our work, diacritic marks replace the tradition-al use of declensions and conjugations which failto divide nouns and verbs in inflectional classes.The inflectional structure of words is handledby a grammar which assigns a binary tree structureto the words in question.
The rules are of the form(2) Word ?
stem Infl,where, Word and stem are lexical categories andInfl indicates the inflectional ending.
For nomi-nal stems, Infl corresponds to a single affixmarked for number and case.
(3) Infl ~ affixExample: 6romos ?
6rom-os (nom, sg)"street"For verbs, the constituent Infl refers eitherto one or to two affixes.
In the latter case, Twoaffixes belong to The endings of verbal types thatare aspectually marked.
(4) Infl * affix InflExample: 7mapsame + 7rap s"we wTote .... write" ~erf~ameBPplpastJNote that the stem 7rap is listed in the dictiona-ry as ymaf.
The consonant \[f~ is changed to \[p\]because of the \[s 3 that follows.
The phonologicalrule in ouestion is lexical and it applies to themorpheme boundary.
As such, the rule is morpholo-gically conditioned and ~r allows exceptions~When verbal types do not contain an aspectualmarker, Infl refers to a single affix.3.1 The dictionary structureIn our system, The dictionary consists of a se-quence of entries each in the form of a Prologterm.It has to be noted that no significant semanticinformation is present in our entries because thatfield is still unexploited.
Similarly, The syntac-tic information concerning subcategorization pro-perties of lexical entries is not taken intoaccount.The dictionary also contains information ThatperTniTs the "linking" with the grammar.
So, apartfrom the linguistic information mentioned insection 2, every entry of the dictionary containsalsoa.
a list of rules that permit the use of aparticular entry (rules That have the entry asTheir Terminal symbol).b.
a list of validatio~ rules (rules that canbe applied after each use of that entry).As far as morphology is concerned, forms can bearranged into classes.
We choose arbitrarily anelement of this class called a "model" and everystem in the dictionary refers to a model.
Morpho-logical information is found at the model level.In this way, the size of the dictionary is signi-ficantly reduced.The model file consists also of sequences ofentries, each in the form of a Prolog term.
Eachmodel includes information concerninga.
The form of the string,b.
the "basic initial mule" which identifiesthe string,c.
the possible diacritic mark,d.
the set of morpho-syntactic features,e.
the validation rules which substitute wordformation rules.3.2 Examples from the dictionaryExample of a dictionary entry:2For a detailed study of lexical Dhonological ru-les, c.f.

The gmammamIn order to carry out the processing we use a"validation grammar" as defined in Cour~in 1977.4.1 Review of validation g~e,,,a~sA validation grammar GV is a 4-tupleGV=(VTv , SV, gV, E), where,VTV = a vocabulary of terminal symbols.E=a subset of the set of in tegers .SV @ ~(E) and is called axiom~V=a finite set of production rules.A production is an element of the applicationE ?
VTV X@(E)Productions are of the formi ?
a\[jl ..... jq\] ori ?
a\[O\], where i e E,Dl'J ..... jq\] e @(E~, a ~ VrvProperty 1A validation Krammar is equivalent to a re~ul~vgrammar since they generate the same language.Consequently, there is a finite automaton that re-cognizes the strings generated by a validationgrammar.P~oper, ty 2The number of production rules of a validationgrammar is less than or equal to the number ofproduction rules of its equivalent regular grammar.4.2 Contmol, Transmission and phonological changesContr~l is carried out with the help of valida-tions which ame redefined after the application ofeach rule.
In our system, validation rules consistof a list of PPolog clauses.Transmission concerns the grammatical categoryand other morpho-syntactic features.Linguistically, we regard stems to be the headof inflectedwords.
As such, they contribute tothe categorial specifications of the words.
More-over, all morpho-syntactic features of inflectio-nal affixes ape also copied to the word.
In wordstructures built in the form of a tree, featuresape percolated to the mother node according to thePercolation Principle as it was formulated bySelkirk.
(i) Percolation Principle (Selkirk 1982)a.
If a head has a feature specification \[aFi\],a~u, its mother node must be specified \[aFi\] andvice versa.b.
If a non head has a feature specificationuSfj\] and the head has the feature specificationFjj, then the mother node must have the featurespecification ~Fj\].
(page 76).The principle in question is incorporated inour validation Pules where, for each inflectedword, it is determined which features are takenfrom the stem and which come from the affix.
(2) Example of a validation mulerule(nil,Stem, ,StFeat, ,Affix,\[\],\[fFeat,A~alResult,\[\],ResFeat,AfVal):-concat(Stem,Affix,Result),append_list(StFeat,AfFeat,ResFeat)where, "concat" is a Prolog predicate performingthe concatenation of two strings and "append list"is a Prolog predicate performing the concatenat-ion of two lists.However, accoDding to Ralli's study, featuresare not only percolated To words from stems andaffixes.
Feature values may also be inserted tocertain underspecified environments.
For instance,when an inflected word fails to take certain fea-tures fl~om both the stem and the ending, the rulethen takes over the role of adding them.
Considerthe verbal form 71"afo: "I write".
It takes the ca-tegory value from the stem (TTaf-) and the featu-res of person and number from the affix (-o:).
Itis clear that at this point, 7Taro: is underspeci-fled because besides the values of person and num-ber, greek verbal forms must be characterized byaspect, tense and voice.
Following this, we assumethat specific values of the last three attributesare inserted by the rule governing the combinationof the stem ymaf- with the ending -o:.

Both the insertion and thephonological form of the elements are always con-ditioned by the morphological environment.Nominal as well as verbal inflection undergomorpho-phonological insertion depending on thekind of stem that is involved in the process.
Anexample of morpho-phonological insertion is theverbal thematic vowel.

Afyraf o mai "I am written"yraf e Tai "It is written"Similarly, in certain nouns and adjectives, avowel appears in singular, between the stem andthe inflection.

Aftami a s "cashier"foiti:t i: s "univ.
student"Insertion is not the only morphophonologicalphenomenon.4.2.2 Morpho-phonological changeAs already mentioned in section 2, verbal in-flecZion undergoes morphophonological changes onthe stem and/or the affix during the constructionof aspectually marked verbal types.
Rules perfor-ming phonological changes are applied cyclicallyeach time the appropriate lexical string is formed.Phonological rules take into account a list ofphonemes described as sets of distinctive features.In our system, phonemes are listed as Prolog terms.Phonological rules are listed as Prolog clauses.Take for example the form 6e-s-ame "we tied".The stem 6e- is listed in the dictionary as 6en-.The validation rule authorizing the concatenationof 6en- and -s- demands the application of a lexi-cal phonological rule responsible for the deletionof the final Inl.~.2.3 The augment ruleIt is generally accepted that augment in ModernGreek must be considered as a phonological elementintroduced in the appropriate morphological envi-ronment.
That is, an e- is prefixed to forms markedfor past in which it is always accentuated.
Giventhe fact that accentuation is not treated here, wedecided to divide verbal stems in marked and un-marked for augment.
Once a verbal item is built,the e- is added at the beginning of the form insingular and third person plural only if the stemcarries the feature \[aug\].In our system, the augment rule, listed also asa Prolog clause, is activated by validation rulesauthorizing the concatenation of a verbal stem anda verbal affix marked for past.
The same rulesinsert the feature value "active".In this way, we obtain:(i) e-yraf-a~Taf-amebut not ee-yraf-ame"I was writing""We were writing"5.
The ProcessThe analysis of a word form is carried out in-dependently of its syntactic environment.
Conse-quently, the analyzer will provide the set of allpossible analyses.In order to program and store the automaton,weperform a splitting of its transitions and eachtransition is represented by a rule.

Thestem "avl" is validated by rules n2!

Moreover, they perform morpho-pho-nological insertion of the transition element -i:during the concatenation of "avl" and " ".
Theresulting string is avli: in  both cases.
Theserules also perform feature insertions.
Rule n21inserts feature values \[nominative\] and \[singular\]while n23 inserts feature values ~ccusative\] and\[singular_~ .The analysis of the form avli: is completed in27 hundredths of a second (cpu time).As already mentioned the system is reversible.In order to generate all possible forms of avli:we apply all validation rules of the stem "avl"and thus we obtain:29"avl" init" " n21.

ConclusionIn this paper, a morphological processor hasbeen presented that is capable of handling lexicalphonological phenomena.
Future developments aim atimplementing a friendly user language and comple-ting the user interface.
We also plan to producean implementation under UNIX, probably in C,whichwill hopefully become a component of an integratednatural language processing system for Greek.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSOur participation in the Conference was finan-ced partially by the EUROTRA-GR project and par-tially by the National Hellenic Research Founda-tion.The realization of the project was made possi-ble thanks to the infrastructure provided by theNational Documentation Center project at theN.H.R.F.We would like to thank Prof. A.
