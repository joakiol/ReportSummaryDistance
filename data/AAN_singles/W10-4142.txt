Combining Character-Based and Subsequence-BasedTagging for Chinese Word SegmentationJiangde Yu, Chuan Gu, Wenying GeSchool of Computer and Information Engineering, Anyang Normal Univer-sity, Anyang  455002, Chinajiangde_yu@tom.com, {jkx-20,ligepw}@163.comAbstractChinese word segmentation is the initialstep for Chinese information processing.The performance of Chinese word seg-mentation has been greatly improved bycharacter-based approaches in recentyears.
This approach treats Chineseword segmentation as a character-word-position-tagging problem.
With the helpof powerful sequence tagging model,character-based method quickly rose asa mainstream technique in this field.This paper presents our segmentationsystem for evaluation of CIPS-SIGHAN2010 in which method combining char-acter-based and subsequence-based tag-ging is applied and conditional randomfields (CRFs) is taken as sequence tag-ging model.
We evaluated our system inclosed and open tracks on four corpuses,namely Literary, Computer science,Medicine and Finance, and reported ourevaluation results.1 IntroductionIn Chinese information processing, word is theminimum unit to be used independently andmeaningfully.
But, Chinese sentences are writ-ten as string of characters without clear delimit-ers.
Therefore, the first step in Chinese informa-tion processing is to identify the sequence ofwords in a sentence, namely Chinese word seg-mentation.
It?s the foundation of syntax analysis,semantic analysis and discourse comprehension,and also the important section of machine trans-lation, question answering, information retrievaland information extraction(Jiang Wei, et al,2007; Liu Qun, et al, 2004).The research of Chinese word segmentationhas been advancing rapidly and has gainedmany exciting achievements in recentyears(Huang Changning, Zhao Hai.
2007; SongYan, et al, 2009), especially after the First In-ternational Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off held in 2003.
In this field, character-basedtagging attracts more eyes and almost all excel-lent systems in evaluations has adopted thistechnology thought(Huang Changning, ZhaoHai.
2007; Zhao Hai, Jie Chunyu.
2007).
In2002, Xue presented the first paper about char-acter-based tagging on the 1st internationalworkshop of special interest group on Chineselanguage processing, SIGHAN.
He segmentedChinese words with four character tags: LL, RR,MM and LR, depending on its position within aword using a maximum entropy tagger(Xue NW, Converse S P. 2002).
Huang et al imple-mented character-based segmentation systemwith conditional random fields, six word-position tags: B, B2, B3, M, E, S,  and TMPT-6and achieved very excellent results(HuangChangning, Zhao Hai.
2006; Huang Changning,Zhao Hai.
2007).
On this base, Zhao hai pre-sented an effective subsequence-based taggingfor Chinese word segmentation(Zhao Hai, JieChunyu.
2007).
All these references consideredChinese segmentation as character or subse-quence tagging problem and implemented withstatistical language models.The evaluation for Chinese word segmenta-tion in CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 has two subtasks:word segmentation for simplified Chinese textand for traditional Chinese text.
The simplifiedChinese corpuses are offered by Institute ofComputing Technology(ICT) and Peking Uni-versity(PKU), and the traditional Chinese cor-puses are offered City University of HongKong(CityU).
The corpuses involved four do-mains: literary, computer science, medicine andfinance.
Considering plenty of abbreviations,numeric and other non-Chinese strings, oursegmentation system adopted a method combin-ing character-based and subsequence-based tag-ging, and took CRFs as sequence tagging model.CRFs is a kind of conditional probability modelfor sequence tagging presented by Lafferty et alin 2001(Lafferty J, et al, 2001).
In our experi-ment, the CRF++0.53 toolkit1 is used.
CRF++is a simple, customizable, and open source im-plementation of CRFs for segmenting sequentialdata.
This paper described our system partici-pating CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 and presented ourword-position tag set and feature template setand their change in open tracks.
Finally, we re-port the results of our evaluation.2 Combining character-based and subse-quence-based tagging for Chinese wordsegmentationIn character-based tagging approach to Chineseword segmentation, it tags the word-position ofnon-Chinese characters, such as punctuation,letter words and numeric, just like what to dowith Chinese characters.
This method workswell when there is a small quantity of thesecharacters.
But plenty of these characters willcut down the segmentation performance,especially some abbreviation and programmingstatement in computer science domain.Considering this, we used a method combiningcharacter-based and subsequence-based taggingthat is to take an English word or programmingstatement as a subsequence to tag its word-position.
The correct tag for one-character wordis S.2.1  Word-position tag setIn the closed track of traditional Chinese andsimplified Chinese, four word-position tag set isused: B (Beginning of word), M(Middle ofword), E(End of word) and S(one-characterword).
The tag set is also used in open tracks oftraditional Chinese.
And we used six word-position tag set for open tracks of simplifiedChinese: B(Beginning of word), B2(2ndcharacter of word), B3(3rd character of word)1 Download from this website:http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/M(Middle of word), E(End of word) and S(one-character word).2.2 Feature templatesTo define the relationship of some specificlanguage components or information in contextand some being forecasted things is the mainfunction of feature template.
It is generallyconsidered that feature template is abstractedfrom a group of context features on sameattributes.In CRF++0.53 toolkit, there are two kind oftemplates: Unigram template and Bigram tem-plate.
In word-position tagging Chinese seg-mentation, available features are rather limited.The main feature needed to take into account ischaracter feature, which includes current char-acter, previous and next character.
Jiang, Wangand Guan (2007) abstracted the character fea-tures into six templates according different dis-tances from current character.
They are Uni-gram templates.
The type and meaning of thesetemplates are presented in table 1.
When train-ing with CRFs model, these templates will beextended to thousands of features and every fea-ture has a group of corresponding feature func-tions.
All these functions are very important toCRFs model learning.
Seen from table 1, Bi-gram feature has only one template: T-1T0 whichdescribes the word-position transfer feature oftwo adjacent characters or subsequences.
Thisfeature extends limited features in training.Take four-WORD-POSITION-tag for instance,it can be extended into sixteen features.
In ourtracks, open or closed one, the seven templatesin table 1: C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, C-1C1, T-1T0are used.Table 1 List of feature templatesType oftemplatetemplate Meaning of templateC-1 previous characterC0 current characterC1 next characterC-1C0 String of current character andprevious oneC0C1 String of current character andnext oneUnigramC-1C1 String of previous and nextcharacterBigram T-1T0 Word-position transfer featureof two adjacent character3 Experiments and results3.1 Data setOur training and test corpuses are gained fromevaluation conference.
The training and testcorpuses of simplified Chinese are offered byICT and PKU, while traditional Chinese byCityU.
These corpuses involved in four domains:literary(A), computer science(B), medicine(C),finance(D).
In addition, we also use theCityU2005 training corpuses which gained fromthe Bakeoff2005 for open track.3.2 Evaluation metricsFive evaluation metrics: precision(P), recall(R),f-measue(F1), out-of-vocabulary words recallrate (OOV RR) and In-vocabulary words recallrate (IV RR) are used in our evaluation experi-ments.3.3 Experiments and resultsWe adopted combining character-based andsubsequence-based tagging for Chinese wordsegmentation, and conducted closed track ex-periments on these corpuses.
Four word-position tag set(B, M, E, S) and seven tem-plates(C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, C-1C1, T-1T0) areadopted in closed tracks of simplified and tradi-tional Chinese.
Our results of the closed tracksare described in Table 2.In our open tracks of simplified Chinese, weused six word-position tag set: B, B2, B3, M, E,S and seven templates same with closed tracks.Tag set and templates used in open tracks oftraditional Chinese are same with closed tracks,too.
In open tracks of traditional Chinese, wetrained the combination of CityU2005 and cor-pus from this conference with CRFs model.
