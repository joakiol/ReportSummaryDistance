The Cor rect  Place of Lexical Semant ics  in In ter l ingual  MTl,off LEVIN and Scrgei NIRENBURGCenter fur Machine TranslationCarneg ie  Me l lon  Un ivers i tyP i t l sburgh ,  I 'A 15213,  U .S .A .1. ln t roduct i (mInlerlingual MT has tyl)ically come to incltLde a syntac-tic analysis of source language (SI ,) text followed hy itssemm~tic interpretation ~.uld representation i terms of atext meaning representation (TMR) scheme, an interlin-gu,'t.
Recently two distinct views of the nattzre of lheinlerlingua have become current - one based on a worhlmodel (e.g., Nirenburg et al, 1992) and another one basedon the notion of lexieal conceptual structure (LCS) (e.g.,Dorr, 1992).
In this paper we analyze the role of LCS inthe extraction of text memfing and argue that, thotlgh itcannot be considered an interlingua when used by itself,it etmtribtltes signilic+mtly 1o the Sl)eciiication of an ac~teal interlingua.
The task of ;el interlingual MT systembtfilder is, then, to lind tt way to integrate the informalionprovided in LCS into an ontology-molivaled text mean-ing representation serving as interlingua.
In this paper, wepropose a model for Ibis integration mid illustrate the pro-cesses and static knowledge sources involved, centrallyincluding tile lexicon.In Section 2 wc propose a model of MT that involvesboth an LCS-based lexical semantic slruclure and a 'FMRthat is not b:tsed on LCS.
Because our lexicon lbrmal-ism does not represent LeSs, but semantic role namesthat serve ~us labels for LCS variables, we will use Iheabhreviation SDI+S (for synlax-driven lexical semanlies,Nirenburg grad Levin, 1992) in reference 1o our systeminstead of LCS.
We argue that TMR and SI)LS are bothnecessary and that they are distinct.
This model forms thebasis of lexical-semanlic treatment of lexls in the multi-lingual MTl)rojectMikrokosmos.
In Seclion 3 we presentspecific exmnples as analyzed in Mikrokosmos.
Wc illus-trate the static knowledge sources (primarily the lexicon)and the representations that are l)roduccd (syntax, lexicalsemantics, and TMR).
The Mikrokosmos model is basedon a Iheory of form-to-meaning corrcsl)ondence whichrelies on the concept of a society of microlheories inle-grated in a noLi-Slratiticational manner.
We brielly sketchthe main points of this theory in the \[inal SeCliOn of thispaper,2.
The modelTraditionally, intcrlingual MT systems which employ afull-Iflown syntactic module (e.g., KBMT-g9 (Goodman?
~tnd Nircifl)mg, 1992) or KANT (Carl~onell et al, 1992))use a single mapping between syntactic structure and in-lerlingua.
In Mikrokosmos, we propose a different model,as illustrated in Figure 1.
Lexical-cotlcel~lual SlrUCtures(LCSs) have been suggested its meaning represenlalionsfor n,'ilural language sentences produced in accordancewith the semantic theory developed by I lale and Jaekend-o11" (e.g., Jackendoff, 1983) and used in MT-related exper-imenls by Dorr (l)orr, 1993).
The inlerlingtmtext (or texlmeaning representation, TMR) is a slructt~re which repre-sents meaning of texts in accor(laL~ce with Ihe ontology-oriented ;.ipl)roach to COml)tllational seitlantit:s (see Ni,cn-burg and Lcvin, 1992).It is convenient 1() sh-LlCttlre oLlr ,argtHlicLlt for Otis mo(lelarotmd the tmcstions below (refcrrine to labels in Figure1), which we will discuss one-hy-onc in lhe followingsubsSl,Syntae|je \ [ .~,~A~t~, l l'U Ct tl t't~.qL 1/mxieal- \ [ .~  11Conceptual~ 4i-tl,t+t,tni+e2lnterlingua ~N~ CText (TMR)TI, 3Lexlcal-(' ,ol ieeptuli| ~ l)~q t'l'uetu t'e ,~TL,qynt ae tit'.S,h-uc tul+eFigure 1.

Are LexicaI-Coneeplual StructuresI , :mguage-Universal?Attempts have been made to use I+CSs as interlitlgtias forM'I' (notably, Dorr, 1993).
The impetus Ibr such workis provided by obserwttions that in mlmy cases LCSsfor translation equivalents are, in fact, identical.
Themany cases in which LCSs are not identical across lan+gtmI,es pose prol)lems for this apprt)ach.
Methodologi-cally, therefore, tile type o1' work in LCg-as-itlterlinguaprojects is tinding ways of resolving e'ich such cane,based on observing cross-linguistic divergences in re-alizing meanings.
There is a danger Ihat some of thedivergences will prove unlreatable at the LCS level and,alternatively, that solulions for some problems will neces-silale changes I() tile naltH'e of the L'epreseEIlalion whichwill make the resulting struclurc resemble tile originalLCS in progressively smaller ways.
The problematiccases will be those in which translation equivalenls can349have differerit lexical sem,'mtics.
We will inention twosnch cases here.The first problem arises in the context of a complexevent, such as a merger of two companies, which canlie described by mentioning ,'my of its llarts (bids, tie-gotiations, etc.).
This is particularly problematic whendifferent langnages, by convention or for ease of expres-sion, refer to dill'ereut parts of the complex event.
In fact,snch divergences xist even within one language.
For ex-ample, you c:m go to a lneeting (directed motion), attenda meeting (activity), or be at a lneeting (state).
Similarly,while in English one takes a taxi, using a mmsitive verb,the cor,esponding Japmlese for the stone event it takusini noru (get on, board, ride in a taxi), using an intrmlsi-tive verb with a gem argument.
Even seemingly atomicevents and states can be broken down into their :tspectualcomponents to consist of events leading np to changesof slate that result in new slates.
For exgmlple, lhe silu-ation of knowing something can be expressed in Englishusing the stative verb know or in Japanese using a non-stalive verb siru (come to know) in its restlltative Ibznlsite iru (Lit: have coine to know).
In examples nch asthese, there will be no direct correspondence at the levelof lexical semantics in individual lmlguages.The second circumstance in which translation eqniva-lents have different lexical selmmtics i that an element ofmetaling tllat is expressed as :m m'gnment-taking predicalein one l~mguage might not be expressed as an argument-taking predicate in ~mother langnage.
Well-knowu ex-amples from MT literature include like vs. germ verlirde vs. just, etc.
However, lhis phenomenon is muchmore widespread than normally acknowledged in the MTliterature.
Things that are expressed as ln:dn or auxil-iary verbs in English, but are not verbs at all in Japaneseinchlde m~my high-frequency meaning elements ucli asphase (begin, continue, finish), modality (mt4stlshottld,plan, expect, try), mid evidentiality (seem, appeal; looklike).
In fact, thesyntactic means for encoding these typesof megming vary wildly among lmlguages, going far be-yond the well-known verb-adverb divergences.
This iswhy ill the Mikrokosmos intcrlingua we represent snchelements of meaning as features or operators that scopeover clauses mid propositions.2.2.
Ilow is an lnterl ingua Different from an SI)LSOittput?In the cases described above in which a sitlgle event isdescribed witll different lexical sem~mtics the meaningshared by each member in the set of paraphrases makesa better c,'mdidale for the interlingu~d semautic represen-tation thml does the lexic~d semantics; and it is lhis typeof meaning that we are striving to extract ,'rod represent illthe interlingna text in Mikrokosmos.
Additionally, whileSDLS concentrales on the "who-did-what-to-whom" as-pect of text meaning, TMRs cont~dn additional meaningfacets, such as ,'tspect, modality, evidentiality, speech acl,reference, etc.
Finally, as TMRs ~u'e not based on lhelexic:d semantics of one particular lmlguage, there is nospecial benetit o be accrued from the imposition of therequirement topreserve predicate-~u'gument st lctures.2.3.
Universals of Semantic Role AssignmentIt is very enticing to be able to apply principles of lexi-cal mapping theory cross-lingnistic:dly.
Similarities thathave been observed across languages inv01ve linkings ofsemantic rotes to syntactic positions or gramnialical fnnc-lions, transitivity alternations,and verb el:roses.
The latterhave been described if+ soln?
detail for English by B.
Levin(1?
)93) ~md others.
Thns, to ltte extent flu+l the hypothesisof cross-linguistic equivalence holds, the descriptioli ofsimilar phenomena in other l+mguages, for the pnrposesof M'I, becomes much simpler, it not ntterly trivial.l lowever, langnages, as :t rn\[e, have different ransi-tivity altern'ltions (Mitamura 1999) and even when theyhave a similar transitivity alternalion, the classes of verbsto which they ;tpply may be different.
See Mahmoud1999 for a discussion of the differences in the verbs Ih:ltnndergo the cansative-inchoative altern:ttion i  Englishand Arabic) It is, of course, desirable to take advantageof universals, bill it is also necessary to have a syslemthat is tlexible enongh to accommodate cross-linguisticV,+lriation.7.4.
hliegl+allon of SI)I+S into h i ler l ing i la l  MTTaking a l)osition on the necessity of both SDLS and TMRhas to be based on a general approach 1o nnraveling theform-nleaning correspondence.
For example, to make aTMR for John began to read we need to identify a nnm-bcr of meaning elements, prilnarily Ihat something lookplace hefore the time of speech, which was the begin-ning plut,;e of a re<iding evenl carried ont by John.
2 I lowdo we lind tllese pieces of information?
Tinle before thetime of speecll is indicated by the mos7Jfiolog j of"began".The beginning phase is typically intlicnled h, xically by theverb begin in English.
We know that it is the beginningphase of reading becanse the syntax module tells us thaito reed is the complement of begin.
We know Ihat John isreading because John is the snbject of begin (once again,the sytllaelic module produced this element of informa-lion), whose lexical properties tell us thai John is alsonnderstood as the subject of the complcment clause.
Inoilier words, it is the predicate argnnienl structure of be-gin (prodnced by the synlax-to-S DLS mapping procedureill the lexicon entry for begin) Ihat tells ils where to lindulany of the relevant pieces of  information.l laving lhns served the purpose of identifying a partof the selnanlic dependency Io be represeuled in tile linalTMR (just as the liudings of other syslenl modtnles playedtheir assigned roles as clnes for delermining paris of IheTMR strnctnre), Ihe predicate :u'gulnent slnctnre can thenbe disc:tided.
In Ihe l%~llowing seclion we give sonicdelailed exanlplcs of Ihe nlappings involved in prodncingSDLS OUllnll strnctures and TMl,ts :ts well :is relevantparis of lexicon erllries.3.
Some ExamplesExamples in Figures 2, 3 and 4 contaiu a ntnnl'~er of rep-resentative phenomena which nnderscore the diflerencesbetween SDLSs aud TMRs :is well ~ts ilhistrale how tiletwo structures co-exist in the Mikmkosmos processingmodel.
In doing so, we also describe a lexicon designwhich accommodates both Stl'nctures.
In all three exam-pies the SDLS is jilSi one of  the cities for dclcrtnining aCOlilponcnl of nlealling, and is not pre, served is01norphi-I\[l~cidcntally, therefore verb clilsses are nell suilable its sc-lnantio hierarchies fi~r ontology (Mitamura 1989).

Tile examples also illustrate the useof constructions (Filhnore et al 19gg, Filhnore and Kay1992) as a nnit of analysis alongside words, and showthat treatment of MT divergences in this apl)roaeh simplyfalls out of tile general iltodel.
The languages used iorillustration are English, RussimL and Japanese.
Since thesystem is symmelrical, we do not identify which is thesource langtlage and which is the target langnage ill eachexmnple.Pot" each example, we list a TMR, which is the s;unefor all of  tile l{mguages, as well as synlaclic slruclures,semmltic role ~tssignments (SDLS), and lexicifl entries foreach lmlguage.
It should be appment hat tile TMR isnot necessarily isomorphic Io the SDLS of any of thelanguages, and that sentences Irom different languagescml correspond to the same TMR even if their syntac-tic ,'uld SDLS representations are not isomorphic.
TheMikrokosmos TMR structure consists of clauses whichroughly correspond to the "who did what to whont" com-ponent of meaning but also includes uch components asspeech acts, speaker altitudes, indices of the speech situ-alien, slylistic factors its well Its relalions (e.g., temporaltitles) allIOtlg amy el + the above, alld other elements.The lexical enlries include three zones---syntax, se-mantic role ,qssignment, and maPlting to TMR.
(The lirsland third zones are discussed by Meyer et aI.
199 t .)
Thelirst zone specilies an LFG-style (Bresnan 1982) syntacticsubcategorizalion frame of a predicate, including whichgrammatical functions (subject, object, COmlllentcnt, etc.
)the predicate mtlst appear with and any requirements hepredicate has of those funclions (case, syntactic alegory,specilic lexical items, etc.).
The second zone, also in thespirit of LFG, specilies a mapping belween tile gralnlnal-ical fair,talons governed by it pfcdic.
'ttc arRl the sctllatltiCroles it ~.tssigns.
Semantic 1olo :kssignmenl is indicated bycoindexing of a sy111actic slol and a semantic role slot.The semantic role munes used in lhe exantples are simplylabels lot argument positions in lexical conceptual slrtlc-Itlres, which are not showtl here.
The syntax iuld selnallliCrole assignlnent Zotles serve+ the pllr\[)ose of Iocaling theimporlant participators in the sentence.
For example, theymight ell us thal the experiencer :u'gLnltcnt is in the SLIbjCClslot with dative case, or Ihat the phrase functioning as filelheme argument is lound ill the object position.
They arcalso imporlalll ill capltniltg bolh Inrlgtiagc-specilic g ncr-alizalions about verb classes and universals of SClllttnlicrole ilSs\[gnllle\[l\[.
For these leaSOl/S, the syntax and Selllilll-tic role zones are entcial, and therefore ii/tlSl be inch\]dealeven in cases in which they differ drastically from theTMR.The third zone of tile lexical entry spccilies portionof TMR that is associated wilh a lexical item and howthe componcnls of the TMR corrcsltond to the compo-nents of the syntactic alld Semanlic role zones.
We havechosen examples in which the TMR is not isomorphicto the synlactie and lexical senlantic zones, ill tnost ofthe examples, a lexical item specilies Ihat title of its cmlt-plemenls heads Ihe associated TMR.
Ill these cases, Ihesyntactic head of the sentence corresponds 1o some kindof scope-taking operator or a simple feature-vahm pair illTMR..The examples, inci(lcnttdly, illustrate our treatment ofMT divergences--situations in which It source langlmgcsentence and its target lmlguage translation differ sig-nilicanlly in synlactic structure, syntaclic category, orl)ret`licale-argun/ent slrttcltnc.
No special mechanismsare needed to lreat MT divergences ill oln IllO(JCL Alllhat is needed in order to translate a sentence involving adivergence are source and target language lexical enlriesof tile sort ilhlstrated here Ihat mall dil\]erent synlaCliCstrtlcttnes elite lhe S\[llllO TMR.
"File reitreseltlillions i|lldnlechanisnts shown ill the lexical enhies are tllotivaled lornon-divergelll ex:tnlples and do nol have lo lie IllOdifledto deat with divergent examples.
This is because sourceand larger language sentences :.Ire not normally eXl;Ccled1o be isomorllhic to tile "FMR or to each other.Another inlportanI fealuxe of ottr model is that it con-siders constructions to be basic lexical unils ah)ng withwords.
Following Filhnore el al., 19gg, we deline con-structions as (possibly, discontiguous) ynlaclic structureor produclive synlaclic pattern whose meaning it is oftenimpossible to derive solely based on the meanlings of itscomponents.
In other words, a COllSlrtlction is a COlIIbJll,'t-It(lit of a syl/laCfiC Sll'll(:lln'e :ll/d tile associaled sgln~|n\[\]caltd pragmatic representations which, once dereliCt`l, tienot have Io lie composiliortally itroduced by a 'I'MP, ex-Iraclof.
