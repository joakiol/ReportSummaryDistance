SEMANTIC RELEVANCE AND ASPECT DEPENDENCY IN A GIVEN SUBJECT DOMAINContents-drlven algorithmic processing of fuzzy wordmeaningsto form dynamic stereotype representationsBurghard B. RiegerArbeitsgruppe fur mathematisch-empirische Systemforschung (MESY)German Department, Technical University of Aachen,Aachen, West GermanyABSTRACTCognitive principles underlying the (re-)construc-tion of word meaning and/or world knowledge struc-tures are poorly understood yet.
In a rather sharpdeparture from more orthodox lines of introspectiveacquisition of structural data on meaning and know-ledge representation in cognitive science, an empi-r ical  approach is explored that analyses naturallanguage data s ta t i s t i ca l l y ,  represents i ts  numeri-cal findings fuzzy-set theoretical ly,  and inter-pret5 i ts  intermediate constructs (stereotype mean-ing points) topologically as elements of semanticspace.
As connotative meaning representations,these elements allow an aspect-controlled, con-tents-driven algorithm to operate which reorganizesthem dynamically in dispositional dependency struc-tures (DDS-trees) which constitute a procedurallydefined meaning representation format.O.
IntroductionModelling system structures of word meanings and/orworld knowledge is to face the problem of theirmutual and complex relatedness.
As the cognitiveprinciples underlying these structures are poorlyunderstood yet, the work of psychologists, AI-re-searchers, and linguists active in that f ie ld ap-pears to be determined by the respective disci-pllne's general line of approach rather than byconsequences drawn from these approaches' intersec-ting results in their common f ie ld of interest.
Inl inguist ic semantics, cognitive psychology, andknowledge representation most of the necessary dataconcerning lexical ,  semantic and/or external worldinformation is s t i l l  provided introspectively.
Be-searchers are exploring (or make test-persons ex-plore) their own l inguist ic/cognit ive capacitiesand memory structures to depict their findings (orlet hypotheses about them be tested) in variousrepresentational formats ( l i s ts .
arrays, trees,nets, active networks, etc.)
.
I t  is widely acceptedthat these modelstructures do have a more or lessad hoc character and tend to be confined to theirlimited theoretical or operational performanceswithin a specified approach, subject domain or im-plemented system.
Basically interpretative approa-ches like these, however, lack the most salientcharacteristics of more constructive modelstruc-tures that can be developed along the lines of anentity-re!stlonshio approach (CHEN 1980).
Theirproperties of f lex ib i l i ty  and dynamics are neededfor automatic meaning representation f rom inputtexts to build up and/or modify the realm and scopeof their own knowledge, however baseline and vaguethat may appear compared to human understanding.In a rather sharp departure from those more ortho-dox lines of introspective data acquisition in mea-ning and knowledge representation research, thepresent approach (I) has been based on the algo-rithmic analysis of discourse that real speakers/writers produce in actual situations of performedor intended communication on a certain subject do-main, and (2) the approach makes essential use ofthe word-usage/entity-relationship paradigm in com-bination with procedural means to map fuzzy wordmeanings and their connotative interrelat ions in aformat of stereotypes.
Their dynamic dependencies(3) constitute semantic dispositions that renderonly those conceptual interrelations accessible toautomatic processing which can - under di f fer ingaspects d i f ferent ly  - be considered relevant.
Suchdispositional dependency structures (DDS) wouldseem to be an operational prerequisite to and apromising candidate for the simulation of contents-driven (analogically-associative), instead of for-mal ( logically-deductive) inferences in semanticprocessing.I .
The approachThe empirical analysis of discourse and the formalrepresentation of vague word meanings in naturallanguage texts as a system of interrelated concepts(RIEGER 1980) is based on a WITTGENSTEINian assump-tion according to which a great number of textsanalysed for any of the employed terms' usage regu-larztie~ wil l  reveal essential parts of the con-cepts and hence the meanings conveyed.I t  has been shown elsewhere (RIEGER 1980), that ina suf f ic ient ly  large sample of pragmatically homo-geneous texts,cal led corpus, only a restricted vo-cabulary, i .e .
a limited number of lexical itemswil l  be used by the interlocutors however compre-hensive their personal vocabularies in generalmight be.
Consequently, the lexical items employedto convey information on a certain subject domainunder consideration in the discourse concerned wi l lbe distributed according to their conventionalizedcommunicative properties, constituting semantic re-gu!ar i t iez which may be detected empirically fromthe texts.For the quantitative analysis not of propositionalstrings but of their elements, namely words in na-tural language texts, rather simple s tat i s t ics  ser-ve the basicalkly descriptive purpose.
Developedfrom and centred around a correlational measure tospecify intensit ies of co-occurring lexical itemsused in natural language discourse, these analysing298algorithms allow for the systematic modelling of afragment of the lexical structure constituted bythe vocabulary employed in the texts as part of theconcomitantly conveyed world knowledge.A correlation coeff ic ient appropriately modifiedfor the purpose has been used as a mapping function(RIEGER 1981a).
I t  allows to compute the relat ionalinterdependency of any two lexical items from theirtextual frequencies.
Those items which co-occurfrequently in a number of texts wil l  posit ively becorrelated and hence called affined, those of whichonly one (and not the other) frequently occurs in anumber of texts wi l l  negatively be correlated andhence called repugnant.
Different degrees of word-repugnancy and word-affinity may thus be ascer-tained without recurring to an investigator's orhis test-persons' word and/or world knowledge (se-mantic competence), but can instead solely be basedupon the usage regularit ies of lexical items obser-ved in a corpus of pragmatically homogeneous texts,spoken or written by real speakers~hearers in ac-tual or intended acts of communication (communica-tive performance).2.
The semantic space structureFollowing a system-theoretic approach and takingeach word employed as a potential descriptor tocharacterize any other word's virtual meaning, themodified correlation coeff icient can be used to mapeach lexical item into fuzzy subsets (ZADEH 1981)of the vocabulary according to i ts  numerically spe-cif ied usage regularit ies.
Measuring the differen-ces of any one's lexical item's usages, representedas fuzzy subsets of the vocabulary, against thoseof al l  others allows for a consecutive mapping ofitems onto another abstract entity of the theoret i -cal construct.
These new operationally defined en-t i t ies  - called an item's meanings - may verballybe characterized as a function of a l l  the d i f fe -rences of al l  regular i t ies any one item is usedwith compared to any other item in the same corpusof discourse.UNTERNEHM/enterpr 0.000SYSTEM/system 2.035ELEKTR/electron 2.195DIPCOM/diploma 2.288INDUSTR/industry 2.538SUCHE/search 2.772SCHUC/school 2.922FOLGE/consequ 3.135ERFAHR/experienc 3.485ORGANISAT/organis 3.84bGEBIET/area 4.055LEIT/guide 2.113COMPUTER 2.208VERBAND/assoc 2.299STELLE/position 2.620SCHREIB/write 2.791AUFTRAG/order 3.058BERUF/professn 3.477UNTERR/instruct 3.586VERWALT/administ 3.952WUNSCH/wish/desir 4.081, o .Table I:  Topological environment E<UNTERNEHM>The resulting system of sets of fuzzy subsets con-st i tutes the semantic space.
As a distance-relatio-nal datastructure of stereotypically formatted mea-ning representations i t  may be interpreted topo-logical ly as a hyperspace with a natural metric.I ts  l inguist ica l ly  labelled elements represent mea-ning points, and their mutual distances representmeaning differences.The position of a meaning point may be described byi ts  semantic environment.
Tab.1 shows the topologi-cal envlronment E<UNTNEHM>, i .e.

Furtherinvestigation revealed (RIEGER 1983) that there areregions of higher point density in the semanticspace, forming clouds and clusters.
These were de-tected by multivariate and cluster-analyzing me-thods which showed, however, that the both, para-digmatically and syntagmatically, related itemsformed what may be named connotatlve clouds ratherthan what is known to be called semantic f le!ds.Although i ts  internal relations appeared to be un-specifiable in terms of any logical ly deductive orconcept hierarchical system, their elements' posi-tions showed high degree of stable structures whichsuggested a regular form of contents-dependant as-sociative connectedness (RIEGER 19Bib).3.
The dispositional dependencyFollowing a more semiotic understanding of meaningconstitution, the present semantic space model maybecome part of a word meaning/world knowledge re-presentation system which separates the format of abasic (stereotype) meaning representation from i tslatent (dependency) relational organization.
Where-as the former is a rather s tat ic ,  topologicallystructured (associative) memory representing thedata that text analysing algorithms provide, thelat ter  can be characterized as a collection of dy-namic and f lex ib le  structuring processes to re-organize these data under various principles (RIE-6ER 1981b).
Other than declarative knowledge thatcan be represented in pre-defined semantic networkstructures, meaning relations of lexical relevanceand semantic dispositlons which are haevlly depen-dent on context and domain of knowledge concernedwi l l  more adequately be defined procedurally, i .e .by generative algorithms that induce them on chang-ing data only and whenever necessary.
This isachieved by a recursively defined procedure thatproduces hierarchies of meaning points, structuredunder given aspects according to and in dependenceof their meanings' relevancy (RIEGER 1984b).Corroborating ideas expressed within the theoriesspreading activation and the process of primingstudied in cognitive psychology (LORCH 1982), a newalgorithm has been developed which operates on thesemantic space data and generates - other than inRIEGER (1982) - dispositional dependency structures(DDS) in the format of n-ary trees.
Given one mean-ing point's position as a star t ,  the algorithm ofleast distances (LD) w~ll f i r s t  l i s t  a l l  i t s  neigh-bouring points and stack them by increasing distan-ces, second prime the starting point as head nodeor root of the DDS-tree to be generated before,third, the algorithm's generic procedure takesover.
I t  wi l l  take the f i r s t  entry from the stack,generate a l i s t  of i t s  neighbours, determine fromi t  the least distant one that has already beenprimed, and identi fy i t  as the ancestor-node to299whlcn the new point is linked as descendant-node tobe primed next.
Repeated succesively for each ofthe meaning polnts stacked and in turn primed inaccordance with this procedure, the algorithm wil lselect a particular fragment of the relat ionalstructure latent lv  inherent in the semantic spacedata and depending on the aspect, i .e .
the in i t ia l -ly primed meaning point the algorithm is startedwith.
Working i ts  way through and consuming al llapeled points in the space structure - unlessstopped under conditions of given target nodes,number of nodes to be processed, or threshold ofmaximum distance - the algorithm transforms pre-vai l ing s imi lar i t ies  of meanings as represented byadjacent points to establish a binary, non-symme-t r i c ,  and t rans i t ive relation of semantic relevancebetween them.
This relation allows for the hierar-chical re-organization of meaning points as nodesunder a pr,med head in an n-arv DDS-tree (RIEGER1984a).Without introducing the algorithms formally, someof their operatlve characteristics can well be i l -lustrated in the sequel by a few simplif ied examp-les.

points a or c wi l l  startthe procedure and produce two specific selectionsof distances activated among these 11 points (Fig.1.2).
The order of how these part icular distancesare selected can be represented either by step-l i s t s  (Fig.
1.3), or n-ary tree-structures (Fig.1.41, or their binary transformations {Fig.
1.5).I t  is apparent that stimulation of other pointswithin the same configuration of basic data pointswi l l  result in similar but nevertheless d i f fer ingtrees, depending on the aspect under which thestructure is accessed, i .e .
the point in i t la l l ystimulated to start the algorithm wlth.Applied to the semantic space data of 360 definedmeaning points calculated from the textcorpus ofthe t964 editions of the German newspaper DIE WELT,the Dispositional Dependency Structure ?DDS) ofUNTERNEHMlenterprise is given in Fig.
2 as gene-rated by the procedure described.Beside giving distances between nodes in the DDS-tree, a numerlcal measure has been devised whichdescribes any node's degree of relevance accordingto that tree structure.
As a numerical measure, anode's crzterial ity is to be calculated with re-spect to i ts  root or aspect and has been defined asa function of both, i ts  distance values and i tslevel tn the tree concerned.
For a w~de range ofpurposes ~n processing DDS-trees, d i f ferent c r l te -r ia l i t ies  of nodes can be used to estimate whichpaths are more l ike ly  being taken against othersbeing followed less l i ke ly  under priming of certainmeanlng points.
Source-orlented, contents-drlvensearch  and ra t t le rs !
procedures  may thus be per for -med ef fect ive ly  on the semantlc space structure,allowing for the actlvatlon of depeneency paths.These are to trace those intermediate nodes whichdetermine the associative transit ions of any targetnode under any specifiable aspect.fed hJF ig .
