2003 Association for Computational LinguisticsA Model for Matching Semantic Mapsbetween Languages (French/English,English/French)Sabine Ploux?
Hyungsuk Ji?Institut des Sciences Cognitives Institut des Sciences CognitivesThis article describes a spatial model for matching semantic values between two languages, Frenchand English.
Based on semantic similarity links, the model constructs a map that represents aword in the source language.
Then the algorithm projects the map values onto a space in the targetlanguage.
The new space abides by the semantic similarity links specific to the second language.Then the two maps are projected onto the same plane in order to detect overlapping values.
Forinstructional purposes, the different steps are presented here using a few examples.
The entire setof results is available at the following address: http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr.1.
GoalsThis article presents a spatial model that projects the semantic space of a source lan-guage word onto a semantic space in the chosen target language.
Although the studypresented in this article can be described from various angles, we place it within theframework of artifactual simulations of the translation process, and more specifically,access to the target language?s lexicon.
The model is described as a construction pro-cess designed to reproduce cognitive functions and their extensions.
Future researchwill include the study of the psycholinguistic validity of such a spatial representation.Now let us briefly describe the scientific basis of the study.?
Three major areas are generally distinguished in the study of thetranslation process (see Vinay and Darbelnet [1996]), the lexicon (or thestudy of notions), sentence generation (putting words together), and themessage (which brings communicative factors into play).
The first areainvolves choosing the right word, which is usually left up to theintuition and expertise of the translator.
Our model deals with accessingthe lexicon of the target language starting from a notion in the sourcelanguage.
The utility of this research lies in the fact that differentlanguages break down reality in different ways.?
Although the translation process has been mastered by a number ofexperts, it is usually still dependent upon the utilization of tools likedictionaries.
The model proposed here relies on semantic maps andoffers an alternative method based on the concepts of lexical access andlexical neighborhood.?
The work by Anderson (1983) and Collins and Loftus (1975) on theorganization of the lexicon is based on priming and the automatic?

As analternative to these local semantic networks, Masson (1995) proposed aconnectionist model that takes into account the subjects?
reaction timeduring priming experiments (the correspondence is based on theassumption that semantic or phonologic proximity and ease of access arecorrelated).
Rouibah, Ploux, and Ji (2001) showed that experimental dataon interactions between phonology and semantics could be simulated bydistances on lexical maps.
One advantage of this proposal is thatexperimental and artifactual findings converge; another is its ability todescribe a real lexicon.
Although the relevance of our model to therepresentation of the mental lexicon will not be discussed in this article(attempts to gain insight into this correlation are currently underway inother studies), this point is not unrelated to the suitability of ourapproach to modeling translation as a cognitive function.2.
Description of the ModelNo two lexicons are related by a one-to-one correspondence (Abplanalp 1998).
Inother words, the way words are used to refer to extralinguistic reality varies acrosslanguages.
Some examples of this are cross-language differences in color naming and,borrowing Chuquet and Paillard?s (1989) English-French examples, differences like:?
room: pie`ce, chambre, bureau(or in an abstract domain)?
esprit: mind, spirit, witCertain authors (Abplanalp 1998) insist how impossible it is to translate at theword level and propose recourse to the conceptual level as a theoretical alternative.Concepts are thought to depend on human cognitive abilities that are general andshared by all.
Although the correspondence between words and concepts remains acontroversial topic of study (Reboul 2000), the concept/word opposition is neverthe-less relevant to any model of translation, even an artifactual one like ours.
As we shallsee, even when heeding the specific organization and breakdown of each individuallanguage, the matching operation does not take place at the word level but at thesubstrate level (defined below), where the set of meanings of each word ?cuts out?
aform.First, we will present the model we devised to describe the organization of lan-guages.
Then we will explain the source-to-target spreading method used.2.1 A Model Based on Semantic SimilarityThe model was initially developed on the basis of a semantic similarity: synonymy.Note, however, that the data and the model are independent, so this same frameworkcan be used to organize other types of similarity (contextual, phonological [Rouibah,Ploux, and Ji 2001], etc.).
Other authors also organize the lexicon or other kinds ofknowledge on the basis of similarity.
For example, in Edelman?s (1998) spatial modelof internal representations of the world?s objects, spatial proximity reflects object simi-larity.
WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) organize the lexiconconceptually as a network of terms, each of which is associated with a partition into157Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsSynsets (a Synset being a small group of synonyms that label a concept).
Our modeldiffers from Edelman?s in that it deals with lexical semantics, not perceived objects.
Italso differs from Miller?s (1990) approach, in three respects:?
the grain of the semantic units?
the lexical structure generation mode?
the resulting geometry and organizationMost models1 use separate units to represent words or concepts (symbols, points in aspace, nodes on a graph, etc.).
Relationships between units are expressed as proximitylinks (in spatial models) or as arcs between nodes (in networks).
Our model is spa-tial, but it differs from local models in that each term is represented by a region in thespace, part of which it shares with other terms.
This region is constructed automaticallyaccording to lexical similarity links (such as those given by a synonym dictionary).
Itis not the result of supervised learning, nor is it a manual, ontological description ofhow the lexicon is organized.
The next section will break the semantic-space construc-tion process into steps in presenting the initial data, the granular approach, and theresulting organization.2.2 Method2.2.1 Initial Data.
Three databases were used: two synonym databases (one containingFrench terms and one containing English terms) and a translation database (French-English, English-French) that maps each term to similar words in the other language.The links between an entry and the terms that follow it were not chosen ?by hand.?
Thedata were taken mainly from published dictionaries and thesauruses.2 It is updatedand supplemented regularly by the addition of new links between words (synonymyor translation links).
The method used to generate the French synonym database (de-scribed in detail in Ploux (1997) was applied again to generate the English and trans-lation databases.
The first step required creating an intermediate database containingthe set of all links attested in available work in lexicography.
In this preliminarydatabase, a term was deemed similar to another term if at least one lexicographer hadestablished the link.
The final database was obtained through symmetrization of thelinks produced in the first step.
While maintaining the shifts in meaning that occurwhen there is nontransitivity and that, as we shall see, are essential for developing themodel, we created new links to symmetrize any initially one-directional ones.3 Table 1gives a typical example of the structure of the initial data.
Table 2 gives a global eval-uation of the number of entries and links in the lexical databases.
Note that we arenot attempting here to define the term synonymy.
We rely on lexicographic publica-tions, which as Edmonds and Hirst (2002) remarked, ?have always treated synonymy1 Masson?s (1995) model assigns each concept a basin of attraction in a multidimensional space ofactivation.
This framework authorizes a certain form of internal variability for the set of patternscorresponding to a concept.
Nevertheless the basins are disjoint and do not overlap as do the nodes inlocal semantic networks.
Furthermore, this model, built essentially for the purposes of validatinghypotheses and comparing psycholinguistic results, is applicable only to a highly limited vocabularyand is therefore a poor representative of the natural lexicon.2 For the French database, we used files compiled by the National Institute for the French Language(INALF: Institut National de la Langue Franc?aise) from seven different 19th- and 20th-centurysynonym dictionaries; for the English and translation databases, we used files obtained from theFrench company MEMODATA.3 Note that symmetrization does not make the semantic spaces of the two terms equivalent.158Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2Table 1Format of data files.Headword: Similar1, Similar2, Similar3, .

?4 However, having more flexible semantic links does not detractfrom the accuracy of the model.
No other operations are carried out on the data setsbefore application of the model.2.2.2 Semantic Units.
To represent variations in a word?s meaning, each word is asso-ciated with a spatial form (or space) (Ploux 1997; Ploux amd Victorri 1998).
The pointsin the space are finer units of meaning than the word itself.
In our computationalsimulation, the points are represented by cliques.
A clique is a set of terms relatedto each other by synonymy.5 The conjunction of all terms in the same clique crys-tallizes and constrains the meaning given to the word.
These cliques thus constitutegood candidates for generating the substrate upon which the form will take shape.The presentation of the results and the features of the model will be illustrated usingexamples from the headword good for English and from the headword insensible forFrench.
The Appendix provides the full results, as well as the definition of the wordinsensible taken from a French dictionary.
These examples are illustrative of the maincharacteristics of the entire data set.4 Moreover, for the two languages under study here, there are notable differences in how lexicographersunderstand and use the concept of synonymy.
Synonymy relations in French dictionaries, for example,are not always symmetrical and are rarely transitive.
What is more, the links have a broader scope.
Forinstance, the words abri (shelter) and even masure (shed) are given as synonyms of maison (house).
Tomake the databases homogeneous during the matching operation, a new version of the Englishdatabase was supplemented with certain hypernym links often given as synonyms in Frenchdictionaries.
The software offers the user the opportunity to see the output obtained using the twoversions of the English database, displayed under the headings standard search and enriched search.5 By definition, this is a maximal, connected component of the synonym graph.
Words are placed at thenodes of the graph, and arcs between two nodes represent a synonymy link.159Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsThe synonym list contains a heterogeneous set of scrambled terms:?
For the French headword insensible, some of the terms represent a moralvalue (dur, sans-coeur, .
.
.
), others a physical value (inerte, engourdi, .
.
.
),and still others a perceptual value (imperceptible, inapparent .
.
.
).?
The headword good includes many similar terms.
As a firstapproximation, only the most representative are given here.
Some of theterms represent a generic value (right, sound, .
.
.
), others refer to acapability (able, .
.
. )
or have an affect-related value (benevolent, .
.
.
), whilestill others represent a quality of taste (tasty, .
.
.
).The clique list contains the cliques generated from this set of terms.
Cliques representrather precise units of meaning.6?
Here are some examples of cliques representing the moral value of theFrench headword insensible:20: cruel, dur, impitoyable, implacable, inexorable, inflexible,inhumain, insensible21: cruel, dur, impitoyable, implacable, inexorable, inflexible,insensible, se?ve`re22: cruel, dur, implacable, inflexible, inhumain, insensible, rigide23: cruel, dur, implacable, inflexible, insensible, rigide, se?ve`reSome examples of cliques representing the physical value:2: anesthe?sie?, insensible50: endormi, engourdi, inerte, insensible51: engourdi, froid, inerte, insensible52: engourdi, immobile, inerte, insensible, paralyse?And some examples of cliques representing the perceptual value:69: imperceptible, inapparent, insensible, invisible70: imperceptible, indiscernable, insaisissable, insensible, invisible71: imperceptible, indiscernable, insensible, le?ger?

It appears in each clique with a precise meaningthat is constrained by the presence of its neighbors.?
For example, the following cliques have terms in common; the first has astronger moral value than the second:15: calme, flegmatique, froid, impassible, imperturbable, insensible18: calme, immobile, inanime?, insensible?
In the same manner, there are shared terms in the next two cliques ofgood, the first related to taste, the second to personal qualities:80: delectable, delicious, good, lovely, savoury, scrumptious, tasty82: delicious, good, lovely, nice, pleasantThis last point brings us to the study of semantic variations.
The following cliquepath, in which each clique shares at least one term with the next, moves in a relativelycontinuous way from one value to another.?
Transition from a moral value to a physical value:21: cruel, dur, impitoyable, implacable, inexorable, inflexible,insensible, se?ve`re34: dur, froid, impitoyable, implacable, insensible, se?ve`re35: dur, froid, inaccessible, indiffe?rent, insensible39: dur, impassible, indiffe?rent, insensible, sto?

For example, one can use the term engourdi inFrench to qualify the disposition of a person who exhibits little moralreactivity, as in:Il allait comme dans un songe, l?esprit engourdi, paralyse?, sans chagrinvibrant, saisi par une sorte d?engourdissement moral qui l?empe?chait desouffrir, e?prouvant me?me un alle?gement qu?augmentaient les exhalaisonstie`des e?pandues dans la nuit.7 (Maupassant 1881, page 350)Moreover, as we shall see later, this type of continuous link between twovalues, which acts as a metaphor here, is expressed more explicitly in theEnglish example below.7 Although the term engourdi is not specifically translated, to help the reader understand this fine shadeof meaning, here is a translation of the above passage (Maupassant 2002): He walked as if he were in adream; his thoughts were paralyzed, although he felt no great grief, for he was in a state of mental torpor thatprevented him from suffering, and he even felt a sense of relief which was increased by the mildness of the night.161Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsTable 3Evaluation of clique granularity.Entry Number of cliquescontaining entryNumber of distinc-tions found in pub-lished dictionariesNumber of Synsetsin WordNetde?fendre 44 9?13 ?distraction 39 3?10 ?fou 319 10?23 ?jouer 95 15?46 ?maison 123 9?42 ?vert 50 9 ?blue 54 22?34 26house 82 11?24 11good 193 24?50 30look 104 18?73 13mind 87 41?68 13play 240 77?84 47?

At the present stage of our project, clique lists arein alphabetical order, and the underlying semantic topology has not yet been built.The geometric model we are now going to present achieves this step.
Table 3 containsan evaluation of the granularity generated by the cliques.2.2.3 Output Geometry and Organization.
To construct the semantic space, a con-ventional correspondence factorial analysis8 (Benze?cri 1992) was conducted betweenthe cliques and the synonyms.
For each entry, the initial matrix Mij contains nc rows(where nc stands for the number of cliques) and ns columns (where ns stands for thenumber of terms).
It is defined by the formula Mij = 1 if clique i contains term j, and 0if not.
The results showed that the ?2 distances9 calculated using this method furnisha coherent representation of semantic variations.
Table 4 presents the configurations8 Correspondence analysis is a factor analysis method that uses categorical variables (that is,noncontinuous or discretized ones).9d(ci, ck) =n?j=1xx.j( xijxi.?xkjxk.

To show the results visually, the projections onto the principal axes are presentedin Figures 1 and 2.
(The horizontal axis in the figures is the best representative of theform delineated by the cluster of points such that the distances between the points aremaintained to the optimal degree; the vertical axis, perpendicular to the first, is thesecond best representative, and so on.)
Cliques are represented by points, and each163Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsFigure 2Three-cluster semantic space for the English headword good.term by the region in the space delineated by the set of cliques that contains it.10 Usingthe examples again, let us review the main characteristics of the resulting organization.The same type of organization is found in all cases.2.2.4 Distinguishing Semantic Values.
The model plots the different values on themap.
Distinct notions are clearly separate, and gradual variations are maintained.?
In the insensible example (Figure 1), we can see two clusters as a firstapproximation, one smaller cluster labeled by the terms imperceptible,inapparent, indiscernable, ne?gligeable, etc., and representing the perceptualvalue of the word, and one larger cluster containing the moral andphysical values.
In the center of the second cluster, we find the termsdur, inhumain, sans-coeur, cruel, etc., which are prototypes of the word?smoral value.
Two branches come out of this center, one that qualifies amore specific value (re?fractaire, rebelle, impe?ne?trable, etc.
), and one thatleads to the physical value.11?
In the good example (Figure 2), the cliques and terms are plotted on themap in accordance with the proximities of the values and their links.
Onthe principal plane, the cluster of points extends in two directions: thefirst axis represents the capability value, and the second the affectivevalue.
The affective value gradually turns into a taste-related value (tasty,.
.
.
).
These two main directions are interconnected by the generic value(right, true, .
.
. )
located near the origin.10 An appropriate algorithm generates the envelope (i.e., the set of cliques that contains the term) for agiven term.11 In all figures in this article, the principal classes are outlined.
(A publication about the principles of thisautomatic classification model is now in preparation; only the results are given here.

.2.2.5 Spatially Interconnecting the Values.
Table 5 shows the hierarchy of the spatialorganization.
The middle column contains the generic values (when they exist) thatinterconnect the different meanings of the word.
Highly specific values are far fromthe origin.
This organization follows directly from the calculation of the profile matrix,which assigns more weight to infrequent terms and to cliques containing few elements.2.3 MatchingAs stated above, the breakdown and overlapping of the lexicon varies from one lan-guage to the next.
However, several studies (Illes and Francis 1999; Ikeda 1998) havefound evidence that the two languages of a bilingual person access a common se-mantic system.
To handle the problem of lexical differences in our translation model,connections link semantic units rather than words.
Because they are finer-grained thanwords, semantic units are assumed to be less sensitive to the way a given language?cuts up?
the world, and as such, they are better candidates for achieving a closerfit between the two languages.
For a given set of cliques in the source language, themodel constructs the set of cliques to be used for the translation.
The two spaces(one associated with each set of cliques) are then projected onto a map that maintainsthe matches.
The example of insensible is a good representative of the various pat-terns that can appear.
It has two very different, nearly homonymic semantic values,as well as some other values whose meanings overlap considerably.
For this reason,we present the results for the matching operation using this example.
The four stepsin this construction process are described below.Step 1.
Constructing the source semantic space.
In order to build a semanticspace in the target language associated with a term in the sourcelanguage, the system starts by generating the set of all cliques containingthe requested word.
This step is identical to the one described inSection 2.2.2.Step 2.
Searching for relevant target language units for translation.
For allinitial terms similar to the input word, the translation database furnishesthe corresponding terms in the target language.
Some of these terms arerelevant to the initial generic meaning; others are clearly far removedfrom that meaning.
For example, the synonyms timide and le?ger of theterm insensible can be translated respectively as (.
.
.
, shy, .
.
. )
for timideand (.
.
.
, airy, .
.
. )
for le?ger, neither of which is useful in generating thisheadword?s target semantic space.
To find the relevant senses, the modelcompares the source language cliques to the cliques generated from theset of terms proposed by the translation database.
Target clique relevance165Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic Mapsis calculated as follows: Let S be a clique in the source languagecomposed of the terms (tsi )i=1??
?nS , and let C be clique (tcj )i=j??
?nC in thetarget language.
The model evaluates the relevance of the translationbased on the rank of matrix MSC, composed of zeroes and ones,calculated using the formula MSC[i][j] = 1, if tcj translates tsi , andMSC[i][j] = 0, otherwise.
The rank defines a spreading parameter (in themodel, a rank of zero means that the two cliques are unrelated and thetarget clique represents an out-of-range meaning in the translationoperation; a rank of three or more represents a highly cohesive semanticlink).If this last constraint is imposed on all cliques, the model will output arelatively small number of terms belonging to the target?s semanticfield.12Step 3.
Constructing the source-point/target-point geometry.
The factorialanalysis algorithm (presented in Section 2.2.3) is followed to determinethe correspondences between the source cliques and the target cliquesthat were retained in step 2, because they are relevant to at least oneclique in the source language.
The correspondences are determined bytaking the product of the following matrices:Mtr = MScs ?
Tsc ?
M?Ccswhere MScs is the source-clique/source-term matrix defined as inmonolingual processing (see Section 2), Tsc is the matrix that defines thetranslation between the source terms and the target terms (Tsc[i][j] = 1 ifand only if term j translates term i in the initial database), and M?Ccs is thetransposed target-clique/target-term matrix.For a subset of the French cliques of insensible, the closest three Englishcliques are given below for each French clique, along with a table of thecorresponding distances calculated on the principal plane (Table 6).
Themaps reproduced in Figures 3?5 summarize the resulting distances forthe headword insensible.?

Defining the lexical regions.
As above, for each language, a term isrepresented by the clique region that contains it.The next section will use examples to illustrate the results obtained.
The entire setof results is available at http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr.167Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsFigure 3English-French space matching for the English headword insensible.3.
ResultsThe advantages of the model presented are (1) access to an extended lexicon and abroad semantic field and (2) coherence of the matching between the semantic values ineach language.
The results for insensible will be used again in this section to illustratethe second advantage.3.1 Access to an Extended Semantic Field and LexiconThe model fulfills two functions: It searches for a suitable lexicon and organizes theterms found.
For each entry, the initial data provides a short list of terms representingcertain prototypes of the word?s translation.
Table 1 lists the four English terms pro-posed as translations for the French word insensible.
It can happen that certain semanticvalues in the source language are not represented in the translation database.
For ex-ample, insensible has no corresponding French word in our database of English wordtranslations.
However, the model builds the appropriate values in French (Figure 3).The model builds a much larger vocabulary that includes the initial terms fromthe translation database and some semantic neighbors.
Table 7 presents an overallevaluation of the results.Table 7Assessment of lexical access spreading to the target language.Mean number of terms supplied by thetranslation database from a sample of 60termsMean number of terms supplied by thesemantic maps of the same sample14.1 92.9168Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2Figure 4Two-cluster separation of the French and English spaces for the French headword insensible.3.2 Coherence of the Semantic MatchingThe final step in the model consists of establishing a correspondence between thesemantic values of the cliques and the terms in the two languages.
By applicationof the above algorithm, the cliques and terms of the two languages are plotted onthe same map.
This map thus provides a summary of the semantic proximities ineach language.
In order to demonstrate the coherence of the semantic-value matchingafter projection onto the target language, the clusters obtained from the French andEnglish cliques for the term insensible are superimposed on one another.
Figures 4 and5 present the division of the output into two and four clusters.
(The French clusters inthese figures are marked by a darker line and set in a darker typeface than the Englishones.)
As in the two-cluster semantic space for the French word insensible, Figure 4separates the perceptual value from the other values.The three-cluster separation then differentiates the physical-moral value from themoral value.
Figure 5 shows the division within the physical-moral value betweenwhat is more specifically physical and what pertains to emotional insensitivity (emo-tionless, re?fractaire, etc.)
or to the inability to discern that sensitivity (impe?ne?trable, etc.
).Note that although all values initially present in the monolingual space are rep-resented, a reorganization process still takes place during pairing with the target lan-guage.
In French, the terms (re?fractaire, inacessible, .
.
. )
were separated from the terms(inerte, engourdi, .
.
. )
by the group made up of the terms (dur, sans-coeur, .
.
.
), but nowthey are located close to the center.
This layout probably results from (1) the effectof the greater number of terms like (inert, numb, sluggish, chilly, .
.
.
), which, in En-glish, unlike in French, encompass emotional and physical insensitivity and thereforebring these two values closer together on the map, and (2) the prototypical, cen-tral nature of this value in English, as expressed by the terms (impassive, insensible,insensitive, .
.
.
).169Ploux and Ji A Model for Matching Semantic MapsFigure 5Four-cluster separation of the French and English spaces for the French headword insensible.4.
DiscussionWe have presented a model for matching a semantic space in a source language and asemantic space in a target language.
This model, currently built from lexical similarityrelations (synonymy or near-synonymy and translations), uses several representationlevels: cliques, which represent very precise units of meaning; terms, which are repre-sented geometrically by a region in the space containing a set of cliques; and clusters,which are generated from the results of a spatialization process that singles out a term?smain semantic values.
(Again, this last representation level is merely mentioned in thepresent article; the method used to generate it and the rationale for its use in semanticclassification will be described in detail in a forthcoming publication.)
The matchingbetween the French and English spaces is achieved by mapping the cliques of the twolanguages to each other.
The model software allows a user to choose a candidate wordin the target language according to its synonym neighborhood.
A map showing eachlanguage?s neighborhoods and separate clusters for each semantic value helps the usermake the choice.
This system and its interactive interface is a useful tool appreciatedby researchers, translators, writers, and other users.
Although this alone is enoughto justify the model, it would be worthwhile to incorporate it into a more completeautomatic language processing system.
We are now working on enhancing the systemby including context relations, and by bringing to bear a word?s argument structure,qualia structure, and lexical inheritance.Within the past 10 years, original contributions have been made in the areas ofcompositional semantics and lexical context assignment (see Ide and Veronis [1998] forthe state of the art on word sense disambiguation).
Most studies have dealt with thesentence, but some have looked at the discourse and text levels.
Based on a generativeframework, Pustejovski (1995) proposed a computational model that adds a represen-tation of a word?s structures (event structure, argument structure, qualia structure, and170Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2lexical inheritance structure), along with transformation rules for combining units.
Intheir study, Asher and Lascarides (1995) showed that lexical semantics and discoursestructure may interfere with discourse structure and devised heuristics to disentanglethe effects of these two interacting levels.
Other authors (Foltz, Kintsch, and Lan-dauer 1998; Kintsch 2001; Schu?tze 1998) have developed an approach based solely onautomatic corpus analysis in which co-occurrences and their frequencies are used togenerate the semantic space associated with a given word.
Edmonds and Hirst (2002)proposed a model with two tiers: a fine-grained synonym tier and a coarse conceptualtier.
Unlike Edmonds and Hirst?s approach, which rests on an ontological model andconceptual representations, our model is capable of detecting semantic distinctionssolely on the basis of similarity links.
This feature is one of the model?s assets, but it isalso a limitation, which provides the incentive for the enhancements we are currentlydeveloping.
Here is a brief preview of our ongoing projects:?
Certain words are poorly represented in terms of synonymy.
This is thecase for words that are essentially nonpolysemous, like computer or daisy,and thus have very few synonyms.
Such entities are better delineated byan ontological, hierarchical representation and by their qualia structurethan by synonymy links.
Grammatical words also have few synonyms,so they too need to be represented in a formalism more suited to theirown features than the one proposed in this article.?
Usage contexts or domains of application are not currently given for thedifferent semantic values detected by the model.
For example, theperceptual value of the word insensible is employed to modify externalphenomena, whereas the moral and physical values apply to animatebeings.
It would thus be useful, as in a standard dictionary, to specifythe different types of terms the values obtained can modify.?
Our research should help improve map drawing.
At the present time,map neighborhoods rely solely on semantic criteria, which sometimesleads to the map?s including terms with similar meanings but differentsyntactic category memberships than the initial word.These projects should contribute to furthering research on language and automaticlanguage processing.
As stated in the article?s introduction, we are also working on thecognitive relevance of our model.
We have already conducted an initial study aimedat determining whether a spatial model is an appropriate way of representing thestructure of the mental lexicon.
Our work on this problem draws from a preliminarystudy (Rouibah, Ploux, and Ji 2001) which proposes a homomorphism between lexicaldistance (the organizing principal of our model) and reaction time (the parameter usedin lexical access experiments).
This idea is based on the finding that lexical distance issubject to the same effects as reaction time.AppendixExample of a classification, for the French term insensible (taken from Le Petit Robertversion 1.2).
