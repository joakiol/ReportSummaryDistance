f rAbstractFor the SERAPHIN project, we set up two assessmentprotocols m order to be able to more accurately assess the?
quahty of abstracts - the FAN protocol and the MLffCEprotocol, for which we provide the results The FAHprotocol assesses the legibdtty of an abstract, independentlyfrom the source text The MLUCE protocol ls designed toallow users of automatic abstracts to assess then" qualityThese protocols were applied to a corpus of 27 texts whichvaned m length from between three and twelve pages Thesetexts were randomly chosen from EDF archives Theyinclude both sclenUfic and general press articles, extractsfrom books, and internal EDP notes The results of the FAlqprotocol demonstrate he &fficulty of using surface lmgmsucm&cators to assess the.
quality of an abstract, the results o fthe MLUCE protocol illustrate the importance of userexpectations1 lntroductmnThe SERAPHIN system produces abstracts usmg analternative approach, the contextual exploration method(Descl~ et ai 97), based on  the pinpointing of lmgmsttcindications m order to ldenUfy 0 certain structurmgmformaUon, l0 causal arguments and arguments by cause(Jacklewlcz 96), ill) different def'mmg wordings (Cartier 97)The abstracts are made up of sentences extracted from thesource text, and to which semantic labels have been attached(Bern et al96), representing the salient points of the sourcetext from the author's point of view The size of theabstract ss lnmted to 20% of the source textThe assessment of abstracts has oRen been approached fromthe computer documentatmn a gle (Salton 89), particularlyby using crRena such as system's recall and system'sprecision The mare problem with these criteria is theposmlatmn of the existence of a user request, expressed inthe form of a combmauon of describers It can be seen thatthis hypothesis does not generally correspond to the reahtyof using abstractsIndeed, the reader of the abstract has already selected thesource document as being one which belongs to his field ofmterest, and he ~s looking to obtain the most accurateunderstanding possible of the content of the document ThtsIs why, wlthm the SERAPHIH project, we set up twoassessment protocols, FAN and MLUCE, whtch are designedto better assess the quahty of  abstracts .
The purpose of thepresent amcle ~s not the evaluation of the SERAPHIHsystem Rself ~, but "how to evaluate" the quality ofautomattc text suraraanzatmn systemAt the outset, we wished to assess 50 texts, but the cost,m terms of reading tune, forced us to reduce this objectiveThese two protocols were apphed to a corpus of 27 textswhich vaned m length from between three and twelve pagesThese texts were randomly chosen from EDF archivesThey melude beth scienufic and general press articles,extracts from books, and internal EDF notes2 The FAN ProtocolThis protocol anus to assess the quahty of an abstractindependently from the source text and the reformation Itcontains Assessment was therefore camed out by twojurors, who were not specialL~tS m the fields concerned, whoread the 27 abstracts without hawng seen the source texts Ittakes approximately 10 minutes to assess an abstract Theassessment grid contams 4 criteria, which are described belowCrzterwn 1 Number of Anaphora Deprtved of Re.l~rentsGiven that an abstract Is created from sentences from thesource text, It Is pusslble that a sentence contains ananaphora whose referent does not belong to the extractedsentence We must not forget that SERAPHIN does notdetect referents, R detects what it considers to be indicationsof potentml anaphora wRhm sentence Pl, out of a closed hstOt, thts, that, etc ), and then apphes a simple heunsm whichrevolves electing the preceding sentence P0 which containsthe potential anaphora On the one hand, thts heurnsm mayprove to be msufficsent (no exphctt referent, the referent islocated?
m a sentence further up m the text), and on theother hand this heunsm is not apphed to sentence P0 (morder to avotd selec~ng sentences based on cnterta that arei this ~lll be the objectof another report25not "semantic") We believe this crRenon to be adetermining factor with regard to the legtbthty of theabstract, nevertheless the jurors raised several problems Wewill illustrate these via a number of examplesThus, m the following sentence,According to thls researcher, It ts a movement Which zscharacterlsed by a deswe to go backwards, a deswe for astate m which the obstruction between subject and object nolonger exists (Text N~)the anaphonc term is deprived of its referent but thelegibility and coherency of the abstract are not really altered,because, m this textual context, the name of the researcher ~snot considered .to be an important piece of informationNevertheless, m order to restrict ?
the effects o finterpretation, this case was considered to be an anaphoradeprwed of a referentIn the following sentence, .
.
.One could say that these first contacts between EDF and theresident created a precedent whtch was notvery favourablewath regard to estabhshmg peaceful relationships betweenEDF and the local populatton ln, mg near the hne (TextN*9)the potentially anaphonc term these may be interpreted asreferring either to contacts described earher m the text, or to' a chronological ccount which takes on meaning as one readsthe entire text, and, m part, at the end of the sentence inquestion In the text under consideration, it Is the secondinterpretation which ts correct, but because the juror &d nothave access to the source text, we treated this case as ananaphora deprived of a referentCrlterron 2 Rupture of textual segments organtsed byLinear lntegratton MarkersVarious studies on textual lmgmsttcs (CharoUes 89, Adam,90) have underlined the utdtty of locating lmgmstac markersm order to identify the dtscurswe organisataons which gobeyond the sentence itself SERAPHIN identifies linearintegration markers (MIL) from within a closed list (on theone hand, on the other ham~ firs@, secondly, etc ) m orderto rebmld textual segments m the abstracts produced Thus,ff sentence P is selected, sentences Pi, P2, Pn which arelinked to P via MIL's wdl also be selected This selectionmay fall, .
either because the MIL ts  not recogmsed (absentfrom the list,, elhpsts, spelling mistake, etc ), or because themaximum size of the abstract has been reached We should-stress both the fact that the jurors can only detect ruptures inthe textual segments, and not thetr completeness, and thatargumentation connectors (such as zndeea~ furthermore, etc )are not considered to be MIL's This decision was takenafter a preliminary validation by ten or so readers, and wasconfirmed by the jurors SERAPHIN uses a special symbol\[ \] to show that two sentences are not adjacent m thesource text, such as m the following exampleIt ts easy to imagine the huge number of texts and wrzttendocuments hat ts produced by a company hke EDF\ [YOf course, all "language productwn" may appear to comefi'om an abstract source, a umque source .
(Text N?6)This symbol avoids the problem of the reader mistakenlyreconstructing argumentation chainsCriterion 3 Presence of "tautologtcal" sentences :.A sentence is considered to be tautological, if theinformation It provides is completely independent of thesource text, as m the following examplePredicting the future is a difficult and uncertain exercise(Text N?4)We were trying to detect abstracts whlch, althoughoptimal from the point of view of the two criteria above,had merely been created from very general sentences, as tsoften the case with certmn abstractsby authors In fact, thiscriterion is far too dependent on the knowledge that thereader has of the subject of the text, and the results of theprotocol show that It Is not pertinentCrtterton 4 Legzbzhty of the abstractThis crRermn, whose values are Very Back Mediocre,Gooa~ Very Good, Is an overall appreciation of the abstractAlthough they are highly subjectave, the "scores" given bythe jurors varied very little, with just the two exceptions etout m table 1 belowJuror  J l  Juror J2Text N ?
