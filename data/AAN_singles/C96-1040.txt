re .krAbst ractThis paper snggests a method to alignKorean-English parallel corpus.
'1?hestructural dissimilarity between Koreanand Indo-European languages requiresmore flexible measures to evaluate thealignment candidates between the bilin-gual units than is used to handle thepairs of Indo-European languages.
Theflexible measure is intended to capturethe dependency between bilingual itemsthat can occur in different units accord-ing to different ordering rules.
The pro-posed method to accomplish Korean-English aligmnent akes phrases as analignment unit that is a departure fromthe existing methods taking words asthe unit.
Phrasal alignment avoids theproblem of alignment units and appeasethe problem of ordering mismatch.
Theparameters are estimated using the EMalgorithm.
The proposed alignment al-gorithm is based on dynamic program-ming.
In the experimenl, s carried outon 253,000 English words and its Ko-rean translations the proposed methodachived 68.7% in accuracy at phraselevel and 89.2% in accuracy with thebilingual dictionary induced from thealignment.
'File result of the align-ment may lead to richer bilingual datathan can be derived from only word-level aligments.1 IntroductionStudies on parallel corpus consisting of multilin-gum texts are often guided with the purpose toobtain linguistic resources uch as bilingual dic-tionary, bilingual grammars (Wu 1995) and trans-lation examples.

Asthe parallel corpora become more and more ac-cessible, many researches based on the bilingualcorpora are now encouraged that were once con-sidered impractical.Alignment as a study of parallel corpus refersto the process of establishing the correspondencesbetween matching elements in parallel corpus.Alignment methods tend to approach the problemdifferently according to the alignment units themethods adopt.
Of various alignment options, thealignlnent of word units is to compute a sequenceof the matching pairs of words in a parallel corpus.Figure 1 show the aligned results of a paral-lel corpus that was originally paired in a sentencelevel.
In figure 1, the right-hand side of pair-wisealigmnent is the corresponding Korean words.
De-scribed in the parentheses on the right of each Ko-rean word are corresponding English meaning andsyntactic functions of the word.The existing methods for the alignment of Indo-European language pairs such as English andFrench take words as aligning units and restrictthe correspondences between words to be oneof the functional mappings (one-to-one, one-to-230~i ,,, I .

Typically a word-phrase is (:otnl)osed of one or more content wordsand postpositional function words.A Korean word is usually a smaller unit than anEnglish word and a word-phrase is larger than anEnglish word.
For this reason the exact thatch asin English-French pair is hard to establish for thecase of Koean-English (Shin et al 1995).
Con-sequently word-to-word or word-to-word-phrasealignment )etwcen Korean and l';nglish will suf'+fee from trait mistnatch attd low accuracy.
Thecomplication of unit mismatch often implies theneed of non-flmctional aligntnent such as many-to-many mapping.
Non-flmctiomd mapping tnayalso occur in the l!htglish-French case, but withmuch less frequency.
'l'he table 1 shows the degree of mismatch be-tween English words and Korean words that areanalyzed by our atttomatic POS tagger and tnor-phological analyzer.
When we checked randomlyselected 200 sentence pairs by hand, only aa.s% orall pairs have one+to-one correspondences betweenEnglish words and Korean words.2.3 Korean  to Engl ish A l ignmentIn this section, we propose a Korean to Englishaligmnent method that aligns in both word andphrase lewds at the same t.ime.
First, we introducethe method in word-to-word alignment, att(l thenextend it to inchMe phrase-to-phrase alignment.By definition, a phrase in this paper refers toa linguistic unit of 1Tlore general structure thanit is recognized in general from the terms, nounand adverb phrases.
A phrase is any arbitrarysequence of ad, iaeent words in a sentence.2.3.1 Base Method  (using onlyword- to -word  cor respondences)In t;he developrnent of our method, we followthe basic idea of' statisticaL1 translation proposedby Brown et al (11993).
'\['o every pair of sen-tences of e and k, we assign a value p(elk), theprobability that a translator will pro(luce e as itstranslation of k, where e is a sequence of Englishwords and k is a sequence of Korean words.p(e.lk) = ~ r,(g Iki) (3)j= l  i=0In equation 3, n and m are the nmnl)er of wordsin the English sentence  and its correspoudil GKorean sentence k respectively, cj and kl are tit{>aligtdng unit between l'2nglish sentence and Ko-rean sentence k. cj rq+resenl,s j-th word in I"nglishsentence and k/ represents i-th word in Koreansentence.
For example, in Figure 1 English word"the" is ct and Korean word "ku" is kt.2.3.2 P roposed  Method  (ExtendedMethod)The base method of word level aligtnncnt is ex-tend('d with 1)hrase-level alignntettt hat ow'x-comes the dHDrence of matching unit and providesmore opportunity for the extraction of richer lit>guistic information such as l)hrasal-lewq bilingualdictionary.
To cot)e with the data sparseness prob-lem caused by considering all possible phrases, werepresent phrases by the tag sequences of theircomponent words.If an English sentence and its Korean trans-lation k are partitioned into a sequence of' phrasesp~.
and t)~ of all possible sequences s(e, k), we canwrite p(elk) as in equation 5 where l)~ and Pk arephrase sequences and a(p+, t>~:) denotes all possiblealignments between Pe and Pk./ ) (e lk)> (4)<pk,p, >ES<Pk ,p,.

The dynamic programming in thecontext of al ig|nnent assumes fltat th,+, previous233selections do not interfere with the fllture deci-sions.
The alignment decision, however, may de-pend on the previous matches to the extent thatthe results from dynamic programming inay notbe sufficiently accurate.

Taking Tand L as constants, the order of complexity be-comes O(MN).As another method to relax the problem of de-cision dependency on the previous matches, pre-emptive scheme to find max matching of phraseki,~ is adopted.
In the preemptive aligmnent, theprevious election can be rematched with the bet-ter selection found by later decision.In following algorithm, ~(ki,a,n) denote ej,vwhich has n-th highest matching wdue with Ko-rean phrase ki,~ among all possible matchingKorean phrase and u(ki,a,n) carry the weighttbr tile matching.

The content of training corpus issummarized in table 2.A tIMM Part-of-Speech tagger is used to tagwords beibre aligmnents.
An accurate IIMM de-signed by the authors for Korean sentences takinginto account the fact that a Korean sentence isa sequence of word-phrases i used (Shin et al95).
The l)enn Treebank POS tagset that is com-posed of 48 tags and 52 Korean tagset is used inthe tagging.
The errors that is generated by mor-phological analysis and tagging cause many of thealignment errors.qb avoid the noise due to the insufficient bilingum sentences, we adopted two significance filter--ing methods that were introduced by Wu and Xia(1994).
First, the Korean sentences consisting ofwords with more than 5 occurrences in the corpusare considered in the experiment.
Second, we se..lected the English words that accounts for the top0.80 of the translation probability density given aKorean word.When we selected 200 sentence pairs randomlyand manually tested aligned results, we obtained68.7% precision at the phrase level and 89.2%precision of bilingual dictionary induced from thealignment.
The table 3 and 4 illustrate tile bilin-gual knowledge acquired from the aligned results.The information in table 4 is the unique productof phrase-level alignment.3 Conc lus ionWith the alignment of Koreanq~,nglish entences,the most serious problem, that is seldom foundat indo-European language pairs, is how to over-come tile differences of word unit and word order.The proposed method is an extension of word levelalignment and solves the problems of word unitmismatch and word order through phrase levelalignment.
We have also described several alter-natives of alignment and parameter estimation.234Table 3: Examples of result for word translationprol)ability.Korean word English word probMfilityyengliyengliyenglikionkionkionkionkioncleversrHartclevernessdegreestemperaturescentigradeincreasewould0.6163310.2381970.1454720.2799920.2487060.1317130.71308940.
