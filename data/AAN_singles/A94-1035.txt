jpAbstractThis paper proposes an English adverbordering method based on adverb gram-matical functions (subjuncts, adjuncts, dis-juncts and conjuncts) and meanings (pro-cess, space, time etc.
), preferred positionsin sentences (initial, medial, end, pre,post), and priorities between adverbs withthe same preferred position.1 IntroductionAdverbs I have various complex grammatical func-tions in sentences but they do not construct the mainparts of sentence meaning.
In natural anguage pro-cessing, therefore, the study of adverbs has not de-veloped very far to date.Linguists have examined adverb grammaticalfunctions and meanings in detail(Quirk et al,1985) (Greenbaum, 1969).
Our method is based onthese studies about adverb grammatical functionsand meanings.
Other adverb studies by linguists in-clude studies which handle the meanings of specificadverbs, such as "even ", "s~ill" and "already " andtemporal adverb studies which handle temporal se-mantics in sentences.The main problems in adverb processing inJapanese to English machine translation(Ogura etal., 1993) are as follows:1. the multiplicity of adverb meanings2.
differences in expression between Japanese and En-glish for adverbial meaning3.
word ordering of English adverbs in English gener-ation4.

The first isinitial position (IP), the beginning of the sentence.The second is medial position (MP), between thesubject and predicate, or if auxiliary verbs are in-volved in the sentence just after the first auxiliary1In this paper, adverbs include idiomatic adverbialphrase, such as "on purpose".verb.
The third is end position (EP), after a predi-cate.
Pre position (PreP) and post position (PostP)are provided for adverbs as modifiers.
A pre posi-tion adverb comes before a modificant and a postposition adverb comes after a modificant.2.2 Class i f icat ionAdverbs can roughly be divided into subjuncts, ad-juncts, disjuncts and conjuncts by their grammaticalfunction.
We classify adverbs by specifying differ-ences in meaning and preferred positions within sen-tences for each adverb.
The classification is shownin Figure 1.SubjunctsViewpoint, Courtesy,Subject-orientation Item GeneralVolitional MP & EPFocusing Restrictive PreP & PostP,Additive PreP & PostP & EP & IP & MP,Emphasizers Prep & EP,Amplifiers PreP & PostP & EP,Downtoners PreP & EP,AdjunctsManner, Means, Instrument, Position, Direction,Time-position MP & EP,Span MP & EP,Time-frequency Definite,Indefinite MP & EPDisjunctsStyle,Content Value Judgment Non-subject,Subject,Degree of truthConjuncts IP & EPPost Position Numeral ModifiersFigure 1: Adverb Classification3 Word Ordering Method  forEnglish AdverbsAdverbs usually have many meanings, especially ad-verbs which are used frequently in our daily life.Normally the difference in meaning is indicated bythe position in the sentence.The position of an adverb depends not only onthe adverb's meaning but also on the relationshipbetween the adverb and other sentence lements.Figure 2 shows order priorities in adverb position,for when two or more adverbs come in the same posi-tion.
~ shows the priority at some position, the left190side of the right arrow comes before the right side ofthe right arrow in the sentence.
The priority reflectsthe scopes of adverbs.
For example, conjuncts usu-ally have wider scope than disjuncts, so conjunctscome before disjuncts at the initial position.Initial positionConjuncts =~Style Disjuncts, Content Disjunets =~Viewpoint Subjuncts,General Subject-orientation Item Subjuncts =~Additive Focusing SubjunctsMedial positionIndefinite Time-frequency Adjuncts =~Time-position Adjuncts =~Span Adjuncts =~Volitional Subject-orientation Item Subjuncts,Courtesy Subjuncts =~Additive Focusing SubjunctsEnd positionAmplifiers, Downtoners =*Manner & Means & Instrument AdjunctsDirection Adjuncts =~Position Adjuncts =,,Span Adjuncts =VDefinite Time-frequency Adjuncts,Indefinite Time-frequency Adjuncts =~Time-position Adjuncts ::~Volitional Subject-orientation Item Subjuncts =~Emphasizers =VAdditive Focusing SubjunctsConjunctsFigure 2: Word Order of Adverbs4 Exper imenta l  Resu l ts4.1 Exper iment  1The first experiment is performed on sentences withat least one Japanese adverb taken from the "Dictio-nary of Basic Japanese Usage for Foreigners".
Thesentences are translated by a human translator.
Wemanually examined whether English adverbs in thetranslation would be generated correctly using theproposed method.
The results of experiment 1 areshown in Figure 3.4.2 Experiment 2The second experiment had the Japanese to En-glish machine translation system ALT-J/E translateJapanese sentences to test various English adverbfunctions.
The goal was to confirm that this adverbordering method could handle various types of En-glish adverbs.The experiment considered 200 arbitrary sen-tences which ALT-J/E was known to analyze cor-rectly.
This method was compared to a previous ver-sion of ALT-J/E which did not use adverbs' gram-matical functions and meanings but only this pre-ferred adverb positions.
The result is as follows.Table 1: Results of Experiment 2Method Accuracy rateThis Method 98%Previous Method 86%COS --- Correctly ordered sentencesImproved Sentences: 27 (13.5%)Sentences changed for the worse: 3 (1.5%)COS1961725 Conc lus ionA new adverb classification based on adverb gram-matical functions, meanings and adverb preferredpositions for English adverb generation i  machinetranslation was proposed.
The effectiveness of theEnglish adverb ordering method in Japanese to En-glish machine translation based on the adverb clas-sification and the priority of the same adverb pre-ferred positions is shown.
The priority was decidedby examining sentences with adverbs to generate En-glish adverbs in Japanese to English machine trans-lation.
If correct English adverbs are selected afterJapanese analysis and Japanese to English transfer,about 97% of adverbs can be put correct positionsin sentences by this adverb ordering method.
Com-pared with the previous adverb ordering method, theaccuracy rate of the proposed method is improved12%.
The proposed method can also be used foradverbial prepositional phrases.Examined ObjectsJapanese adverb entries: 362 wordssentences: 1,906 sentencesEnglish adverbs translated fromJapanese adverbs: 1,053Accuracy rate 97.3%Adverbs generated in incorrect positions 28(2.7%)absolutely incorrect position: 12 (1.1%)strange position: 16 (1.5%)Figure 3: Results of Experiment 1This experiment confirmed that the proposedword ordering method can handle large amount ofadverbs correctly.191ReferencesS.
