We illustrate this on theHindi and Urdu language pair.
FSTs canalso be used for translation between sur-face-close languages.
We introduce UIT(universal intermediate transcription) forthe same pair on the basis of their com-mon phonetic repository in such a waythat it can be extended to other languageslike Arabic, Chinese, English, French, etc.We describe a transliteration model basedon FST and UIT, and evaluate it on Hindiand Urdu corpora.1 IntroductionTransliteration is mainly used to transcribe aword written in one language in the writing sys-tem of the other language, thereby keeping anapproximate phonetic equivalence.
It is useful forMT (to create possible equivalents of unknownwords) (Knight and Stall, 1998; Paola and San-jeev, 2003), cross-lingual information retrieval(Pirkola et al 2003), the development of multi-lingual resources (Yan et al 2003) and multilin-gual text and speech processing.
Inter-dialectaltranslation without lexical changes is quite usefuland sometimes even necessary when the dialectsin question use different scripts; it can beachieved by transliteration alone.
That is the caseof HUMT (Hindi-Urdu Machine Transliteration)where each word has to be transliterated fromHindi to Urdu and vice versa, irrespective of its?

?One man?s Hindi is another man?s Urdu?
(Rai, 2000).
The major difference between Hindiand Urdu is that the former is written in Devana-gari script with a more Sanskritized vocabularyand the latter is written in Urdu script (derivationof Persio-Arabic script) with more vocabularyborrowed from Persian and Arabic.
In contrast tothe transcriptional difference, Hindi and Urdushare grammar, morphology, a huge vocabulary,history, classical literature, cultural heritage, etc.Hindi is the National language of India with 366million native speakers.
Urdu is the National andone of the state languages of Pakistan and Indiarespectively with 60 million native speakers(Rahman, 2004).

People from Hindi and Urdu com-munities can understand the verbal expressionsof each other but not the written expressions.HUMT is an effort to bridge this scriptural dividebetween India and Pakistan.Hindi and Urdu scripts are briefly introducedin section 2.
Universal Intermediate Transcrip-tion (UIT) is described in section 3, and UITmappings for Hindi and Urdu are given in sec-tion 4.
Contextual HUMT rules are presented anddiscussed in section 5.
An HUMT system im-plementation and its evaluation are provided insection 6 and 7.
Section 8 is on future work andconclusion.5372 HUMTThere exist three languages at the border betweenIndia and Pakistan: Kashmiri, Punjabi and Sindhi.All of them are mainly written in two scripts, onebeing a derivation of the Persio-Arabic script andthe other being Devanagari script.
A person us-ing the Persio-Arabic script cannot understandthe Devanagari script and vice versa.
The same istrue for Hindi and Urdu which are varieties ordialects of the same language, called Hindustaniby Platts (1909).PMT (Punjabi Machine Transliteration) (Ma-lik, 2006) was a first effort to bridge this scrip-tural divide between the two scripts of Punjabinamely Shahmukhi (a derivation of Perio-Arabicscript) and Gurmukhi (a derivation of Landa,Shardha and Takri, old Indian scripts).
HUMT isa logical extension of PMT.
Our HUMT systemis generic and flexible such that it will be extend-able to handle similar cases like Kashmiri, Pun-jabi, Sindhi, etc.
HUMT is also a special type ofmachine transliteration like PMT.A brief account of Hindi and Urdu is first giv-en for unacquainted readers.2.1 HindiThe Devanagari (literally ?godly urban?)
script, asimplified version of the alphabet used for San-skrit, is a left-to-right script.
Each consonantsymbol inherits by default the vowel sound [?
].Two or more consonants may be combined to-gether to form a cluster called Conjunct thatmarks the absence of the inherited vowel [?]
be-tween two consonants (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut,2004).

It is a right-to-left scriptand the shape assumed by a character in a wordis context-sensitive, i.e.
the shape of a characteris different depending on whether its position isat the beginning, in the middle or at the end of aword (Zia, 1999).

)3 Universal Intermediate TranscriptionUIT (Universal Intermediate Transcription) is ascheme to transcribe texts in Hindi, Urdu, Punja-bi, etc.
in an unambiguous way encoded in AS-CII range 32 ?
126, since a text in this range isportable across computers and operating systems(James 1993; Wells, 1995).
SAMPA (SpeechAssessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet) is awidely accepted scheme for encoding the IPA(International Phonetic Alphabet) into ASCII.
Itwas first developed for Danish, Dutch, French,German and Italian, and since then it has beenextended to many languages like Arabic, Czech,English, Greek, Hebrew, Portuguese, Russian,Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, etc.We define UIT as a logical extension ofSAMPA.
The UIT encoding for Hindi and Urduis developed on the basis of rules and principlesof SAMPA and X-SAMPA (Wells, 1995), thatcover all symbols on the IPA chart.
Phonemesare the most appropriate invariants to mediatebetween the scripts of Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, etc.,so that the encoding choice is logical and suitable.4 Analysis of Scripts and UIT MappingsFor the analysis and comparison, scripts of Hindiand Urdu are divided into different groups on thebasis of character types.4.1 ConsonantsThese are grouped into two categories:Aspirated Consonants: Hindi and Urdu bothhave 15 aspirated consonants.
In Hindi, 11 aspi-rated consonants are represented by separate cha-racters e.g.
?
[k?
], ?
[b?
], etc.
The remaining 4consonants are represented by combining a sim-ple consonant to be aspirated and the conjunctform of HA ?
[h], e.g.
?
[l] + ??
+ ?
[h] = ???
[l?
].In Urdu, all aspirated consonants arerepresented by a combination of a simple conso-nant to be aspirated and Heh Doachashmee (?
)[h], e.g.
?
[k] + ?
[h] = ??
[k?
], ?
[b] + ?
[h] = ??[b?

~Table 3: Hindi Urdu non-aspirated consonants4.2 VowelsHindi has 11 vowels and 10 of them have nasa-lized forms.
They are represented by 11 indepen-dent vowel symbols e.g.
?
[?
], ?
[u], ?
[?],etc.
and 10 dependent vowel symbols e.g.
??[?
], ??
[u], ??
[?
], etc.
called maatraas.
When avowel comes at the start of a word or a syllable,the independent form is used; otherwise the de-pendent form is used (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut,2004).Urdu contains 10 vowels and 7 of them havenasalized forms (Hussain, 2004; Khan, 1997).Urdu vowels are represented using four long vo-wels (Alef Madda (?
), Alef (?
), Vav (?)
and ChotiYeh (?))
and three short vowels (Arabic Fatha ?Zabar -?, Arabic Damma ?
Pesh -?
and Arabic Ka-sra ?
Zer -?).
Vowel representation is context-sensitive in Urdu.
Vav (?)
and Choti Yeh (?)
arealso used as consonants.Hamza (?)
is a place holder between two suc-cessive vowel sounds, e.g.
in ?????
[k?m?i](earning), Hamza (?)
separates the two vowelsounds Alef (?)
[?]
and Choti Yeh (?)
[i].
Noon-ghunna (?)
is used as nasalization marker.
Anal-ysis and mapping of Hindi Urdu vowels is givenin Table 5.4.3 Diacritical MarksUrdu contains 15 diacritical marks.
Theyrepresent vowel sounds, except Hamza-e-Izafat  -?and Kasr-e-Izafat -?
that are used to build com-pound words, e.g.
???????
?????
[???r?h?s?
?ns] (In-stitute of Science), ???????
??????
[t?rix?ped???
](date of birth), etc.
Shadda -?
is used to geminatea consonant e.g.
???
[r?bb] (God), ?????
[?????
](good), etc.
Jazm  -?
is used to mark the absence ofa vowel after the base consonant (Platts, 1909).In Hindi, the conjunct form is used to geminate aconsonant.

[meri ?u?i s?r?x h?]
(My bangle is red.
)In the first sentence, the word ????
is pro-nounced as [??
?i] (wide) and in the second, it is539pronounced as [?u?i] (bangle).
There should beZabar (??)
and Pesh (??)
after Cheh (?)
in abovewords and correct transcriptions are ?????

(r1)Note: In Hindi, Nasalization of a vowel is done by adding Anunasik (??)
or Anusavar (??)
after the vowel.
Anusavar (??)
is used whenthe vowel graph goes over the upper line; otherwise Anunasik (??)
is used (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut, 2004).
In UIT, ~ is added at end ofUIT encoding for nasalization of all above vowels except the last one that do not have a nasalized form.Table 5: Analysis and Mapping of Hindi Urdu Vowels5 HUMT RulesIn this section, UIT mappings of Hindi Urdu al-phabets and contextual rules that are necessaryfor Hindi-Urdu transliteration are discussed.5.1 UIT MappingsUIT mappings for Hindi and Urdu alphabets andtheir vowels are given in Table 2 ?
5.
In Hindi,SHA (?)
and SSA (?)
both represent the sound[?]
and have one equivalent symbol in Urdu, i.e.Sheen (?).
To make distinction between SHA(?)
and SSA (?)
in UIT, they are mapped on Sand S1 respectively.
Similarly in Urdu, Seh (?
),Seen (?)
and Sad (?)
represent the sound [s]and have one equivalent symbol in Hindi, i.e.
SA(?).
To make distinction among them in UIT,they are mapped on s1, s and s2 respectively.

(r1)Table 6: Multiple Characters for one IPAMulti-equivalences are problematic for Hindi-Urdu transliteration.UIT is extendable to other languages like Eng-lish, French, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc.
Forexample, Punjabi has one extra character thanUrdu i.e.
Rnoon [?]
(?
), it is mapped on ?n`?
inUIT.
Similarly, UIT, a phonetic encodingscheme, can be extended to other languages.All these mappings can be implemented bysimple finite-state transducers using XEROX?sXFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) language.A sample XFST code is given in Figure 1.read regex [?

_ ]?Figure 1: Sample XFST codeFinite-state transducers are robust and timeand space efficient (Mohri, 1997).
They are alogical choice for Hindi-Urdu transliteration viaUIT as this problem could also be seen as stringmatching and producing an analysis string as anoutput like finite-state morphological analysis.5.2 Contextual HUMT RulesUIT mappings need to be accompanied by neces-sary contextual HUMT rules for correct Hindi toUrdu transliteration and vice versa.For example, Vav (?)
and Choti Yeh (?)
areused to represent vowels like [o], [?
], [i], [e], etc.but they are also used as consonants.
Vav (?)
andChoti Yeh (?)
are consonants when they come atthe beginning of a word or when they are fol-lowed by Alef mada (?)
or Alef (?).
Also, ChotiYeh (?)
represents the vowel [e] when it is pre-ceded by a consonant but when it comes at theend of a word and is preceded by a consonantthen it represents the vowel [i].
These rules areshown in red colour in Figure 1.Thus HUMT contextual rules are necessary forHindi-Urdu transliteration and they can also beimplemented as finite-state transducer usingXFST.
All these rules can?t be given here due toshortage of space.6 HUMT SystemThe HUMT system exploits the simplicity, ro-bustness, power and time and space efficiency offinite-state transducers.
Exactly the same trans-ducer that encodes a Hindi or Urdu text into UITcan be used in the reverse direction to generateHindi or Urdu text from the UIT encoded text.This two-way power of the finite-state transducer(Mohri, 1997) has significantly reduced theamount of efforts to build the HUMT system.Another very important and powerful strength offinite-state transducers, they can be composedtogether to build a single transducer that can per-form the same task that could be done with helpof two or more transducers when applied sequen-tially (Mohri, 1997), not only allows us to build adirect Hindi ?
Urdu transducer, but also helps todivide difficult and complex problems into sim-ple ones, and has indeed simplified the process ofbuilding the HUMT system.
A direct Hindi ?Urdu transducer can be used in applicationswhere UIT encoding is not necessary like Hindi-Urdu MT system.The HUMT system can be extended to per-form transliteration between two or more differ-ent scripts used for the same languages likeKashmiri, Kazakh, Malay, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc.or between language pairs like English?Hindi,English?Urdu, English?French, etc.
by just in-troducing the respective transducers in the Fi-nite-state Transducer Manager ofthe HUMT system to build a multilingual ma-chine transliteration system.Figure 2: HUMT SystemIn the HUMT system, Text Tokenizertakes the input Hindi or Urdu Unicode text, toke-nizes it into Hindi or Urdu words and passes541them to UIT Enconverter.
The enconverterenconverts Hindi or Urdu words into UIT wordsusing the appropriate transducer from Finite-state Transducers Manager, e.g.
forHindi words, it uses the Hindi ?
UIT transducer.It passes these UIT encoded words to UIT De-converter, which deconverts them into Hindior Urdu words using the appropriate transducerfrom Finite-state Transducers Man-ager in reverse and generates the target Hindior Urdu text.6.1 Enconversion of Hindi-Urdu to UITHindi ?

These unique words and their translitera-tions are checked for accuracy with the help ofdictionaries (Platts, 1911; Feroz).7.1 Urdu ?
Hindi Transliteration ResultsWhile transliterating Urdu into Hindi, multipleproblems occur like multi-equivalences, no equi-valence, missing diacritical marks in Urdu text.For example, Sheen [?]
(?)
can be transliteratedin Hindi into SHA [?]
(?)
or SSA [?]
(?)
that arepresent in 7,917 and 6,399 corpus words respec-tively.
Sheen [?]
(?)
is transliterated into SHA[?]
(?)
by default.
Thus, 6,399 words containingSSA [?]
(?)
are wrongly transliterated into Hindiusing HUMT.

Hindi Multi-equivalencesSome Hindi characters do not have equivalentcharacters in Urdu, e.g.
NNA [?]
(?
), retroflexedversion of [n], has approximately mapped ontoNoon [n] (?).
This creates a problem when aword actually containing NNA [?]

is transli-terated from Urdu to Hindi.

Hindi No-equivalencesMissing diacritical marks is the major problemwhen transliterating Urdu into Hindi.
The impor-tance of diacritical marks has already been ex-plained in section 4.3.
This work assumed that allnecessary diacritical marks are present in Urdutext because they play a vital role in Urdu toHindi transliterations.

Urdu Transliteration ResultsInterestingly, Hindi to Urdu conversion is14.47% less accurate on the unique words ascompared to its result on the corpus data that is acontrasting fact for the reverse conversion.The HUMT system gives 97.12% accuracy forUrdu to Hindi and 97.88% accuracy for Hindi toUrdu.
Thus, the HUMT system works with97.50% accuracy.8 Future ImplicationsHindi-Urdu transliteration is one of the caseswhere one language is written in two or moremutually incomprehensible scripts like Kazakh,Kashmiri, Malay, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc.
TheHUMT system can be enhanced by extendingUIT and introducing the respective finite-statetransducers.
It can similarly be enhanced totransliterate between language pairs, e.g.
Eng-lish-Arabic, English-Hindi, English-Urdu,French-Hindi, etc.
Thus, it can be enhanced tobuild a multilingual machine transliteration sys-tem that can be used for cross-scriptural transli-teration and MT.We are intended to resolve the problems ofmulti-equivalences, no-equivalences and themost importantly the restoration of diacriticalmarks in Urdu text that are observed but left un-attended in the current work.
Restoration of dia-critical marks in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmi-ri, etc.
texts is essential for word sense disambig-uation, natural language processing and speechsynthesis of the said languages.The HUMT system will also provide a basisfor the development of Inter-dialectal translationsystem and MT system for surface-close lan-guages like Indonesian-Malay, Japanese-Korean,543Hindi-Marathi, Hindi-Urdu, etc.
Translation ofthe surface-close languages or inter-dialectaltranslation can be performed by using mainlytransliteration and some lexical translations.Thus HUMT will also provide basis for Cross-Scriptural Transliteration, Cross-scriptural In-formation Retrieval, Cross-scriptural Applica-tion Development, inter-dialectal translation andtranslation of surface-close languages.9 ConclusionFinite-state transducers are very efficient, robust,and simple to use.
Their simplicity and powerfulfeatures are exploited in the HUMT model toperform Hindi-Urdu transliteration using UITthat is a generic and flexible encoding scheme touniquely encode natural languages into ASCII.The HUMT system gives 97.50% accuracy whenit is applied on the Hindi-Urdu corpora contain-ing 412,249 words in total.
It is an endeavor tobridge the scriptural, ethnical, cultural and geo-graphical division between 1,017 millions peoplearound the globe.AcknowledgementThis study is partially supported by the project CIFLIfunded under ARCUS-INDIA program by Ministry ofForeign Affairs and Rh?ne-Alpes region.ReferencesBeesley, Kenneth R. and Karttunen, Lauri.
