The method contains two innovations: (1)two h.'vel rules ms well-formedness constraints in theinitial phase; (2) the combination of intersection andcomposition of rule transducers in a dee\[) cascade \['orthe final re.suit.KeywordsKorean Lexieal Transducer, 'Pwo level Morphology,Morphotaeties, Ordered ll,ules1 In t roduct ionThis paper presents an incremental constructionmethod of a lex iea l  t ransducer  (LT) for Korean.A lexical transducer, lirst described by Karttunen,Kaplan, and Zaencn (KKZ) (Karttunen, 1992a), isa speeialized tinite state transducer (FST) that mapscanonical citation forms of words and morphologicalcategories to infh.
'cted surface forms, and vice versa.l;\]'s have many advantages for stemming, morpholog-ical analysis, and generation.
They are(i) b ld i rec t lonah  the same structure (:an be used forstemming and generation.
( i i )  ett ic ient:  the recognition and generation of wordtbrms does not require the application of any mor-phological rules at runtime.LTs for li',nglish and French have been built at Xe-rox PARC within a t}amework nown as two- levelInorpho logy  (Koskenniemi, 1983).
As described byKKZ(Karttuneu, 1992a), this can be done in threesteps: (i) we construct a simple flnite-state automaton (LA) that defines all valid lexical tbrms (LFs) ofthe language.. A I,F is a eoncateuation of stems andmorphemes in their canonical dictionary representa-tion.
(ii) We describe morphological alternations bymeans of two-lew,.1 rules(Koskeuniemi, 1983; Kin't-1 '\['his p~per was partially supporl;ed by t(orcan Science andh\]nginecring l,'onndation.tunen, 1993), compile the rules to finite-state trans-ducers, and intersect hem to form a single rule trans-ducer (RSF).
(iii) We merge the LA with the ffF bycomposition producing the 1/\[' that has on its lexi-cal side every valid lexical form of the language andon the surface side the corresponding realization asdetermined by the morphological alternations of thelanguage.KKZ argued that for l!
'rench, it, was best to dividestep (ii) into two stages.
A three-level description wasrequired to give a linguistically satisfactory account ofthe plural lbrmation of eompomld nouns .
KKZ optedfor two cascading two-level rule systems thai; are corn-piled separately, then intersected laterally and finallycomposed to a single RT.The task of building a morphological analyzer for ~tlanguage such as Korean or ,I apanese is a much higherchallenge than it is for l';uglish and French.
A Ko-re.an verb may have more than fifty thousand inflectedforms.
= The Korean writing system (l\]anaul) doesnot consistently distinguish be.tween single and eom-pound nouns.
Because llangul uses syllabic charac-ters, changes in syllable strucl, ure are directly reflectedin the.
orthography.Because o\[' the complexity of the morphological al-ternations in Korean, it; is very difficult, although notimpossible in principle, to describe them in a singletwo-level rule system or in a system that is limited tojust three levels like the KKZ system for French.
Themost natural  description of the Korean alternation isa cascade of rules of greater depth.2 Morpho log ica l  A l te rnat ionsin Korean3'he \[langul is a phonemic syllabic-based script wheremorphologieal alternations that change the syllablestrllctnre of the word are rellected in the orthogra-phy (Korean Ministry of Education, 1988; Kim, 1990).This paper uses the so-called Yale system for repre-senting llaugul in a Romanized \[brm, except; that we2A " e-jel(word)" which is a spacing unit of llangul can con-sist, of a verb stem, scwu'al endings and pnstpositions.

At each stage ill tit(!process, the lexicaI si(le remains unchanged and theiut, erme(liate re\[)resenl,atious are changed by the newset C' rules.
The \[ilml result is a transducer t im|  assoclare's the valid lexic~d forms with their proper surfacerealizations.
Concel)tual ly this is similar to what  hap.|)ells ill a tradit ional  phonologic.~d eriw~tion.

The first step was to divide the total listof morphemes into snblexicons on the basis of theirmorphological type and to make a text file for eachsublexieon.
We added diacritic markers to the edgesof certain types of morphemes in order to be able toenforce morphotactie constraints on valid morphemesequences .Each sublexicon was compiled separately to a finite-state automaton.
The sublexicons were used to construct the LA with the help of the regular expressionfacility in the ifsm-toolkit..For example, having com-piled a simple automaton from the list ofsm@le nouns,we could expand it to an infinite lexicon of compoundnouns with the regular expression"noun.auto" \ [# "noun.auto"l*'\]'his regular expression reads the noun automatonfrom a file and concatenates it with itself any numberof times and marks the internal word boundaries with#.The first version of the LA was made in this way bycombining sublexicons with regular operations (con-catenation, union, iteration).In order to enforce morphotactic constraints on theconcatenation of some classes of snflixes, we wrote aset of two-level rules that require or prohibit he occur-fence of particular diacritics at certain suffix bound-aries.
Lexieal forms that do not satisfy the morpho-tactic constraints get eliminated in the compositionwith the well-formedness rules.
The diacritics them-selves are realized as zero so that they are not presentin the lower side of the resulting transducer.
The finalform of the lexical automaton is obtained by extract-ing the lower-side from that transducer as a simpleautomaton.We believe that  this incremental method of lexi-con construction is better suited to morphologicallycomplex languages than the lexicon format commonlyused in two-level morphology.
In standard two-levellexicons, individual entries contain intbrmation aboutwhich sublexicon they may concatenate with.
The en-tire lexical structure is compiled in one step to largeletter tree (Karttunen, 1993; Antworth, 1990).
Ourmethod is more tractable in two ways.
Firstly, thelexicon can be developed and refined stepwise.
Sec-ondly, the morphotactic rules of the language are de-scribed explicitly as the regular expressions that con-struct the LA in conjunction with the well-formednessconstraints that eliminate certain types of concatena-tions.
In two-level lexicons of the standard variety,the morphotactic structure of the language is not de-scribed explicitly at; all.
l~,ather, it is expressed in avery opaque and indirect way, in the sequences of linksbetween entries and snblexicons.Sproat argued thai; two-level morphology of mor-photactics leads to a somewhat inelegant model oflong-distance dependencies and suggested the unfica-lion scheme, due to Bear, as a solution (Sproat, 1992).But unification scheme introduces additional runtimeoverhead.
The above approach can easily and explic-itly describe the fact that "-able" attaches to verbsformed with the prefix "en-" and does not require ad-ditional runtime overhead.We give a few examples of the difficulties in the de-scription of Korean morphol;artics.
There are two dif-ferent types of endings: (i) non-tinM (verbal) endingsfor tense, modality, subject honorific or aspect, and(it) final (verbal) endings as cornplementizer, nomi-nalizer and adjectivizer.
The non-tinal endings areplaced in fl'ont of final endings and must be followedby a suflix of the second type.
(4) shows the ordering restrictions of non-finM end-ings.
The parentheses indicate optionality.(4.)
(+ lion) (4- t'~st 4- Perf (4- Will)I (+ Past ) (+ Will) (4- Beta'o))(Hon:Honorific; \]~etro:I{ei~rospection ;Perf: Perfect Aspect)(4) compiles to a lexicon covering 20 difi>rent com-pound non-final ending sequenees including null.
'l'hisrepresentation is clearly more informative than a sim-ple listing of the members of the class.
The proM-bition of "Past+Perf+Will+l{.etro" in (4) can not bedescribed by an adjacency table.In (4) we do not need any morphotactic diacriticson the left, because all non-final endings can combinewith any verb and adjective stems arm the combina-tion of non-final and final endings is controlled by thediacritics of the latter group.
(5) shows three entries in the suhlexiron of finalendings.
Tim elements in square brackets are morphotactic diacritics.
(Square brackets indicate grouping,the vertical bar marks a disjunction.)
'Phe diacriticsare deleted by well-formedness rules when the finalendings are combined with other morphemes.
The di-acritics on the left of nun and nuu-ka shows that theycan not combine with adjectives.

.The intermediate l vel, (b), is eliminated in the cas-cade, thus the final lexical transducer maps (a) di-rectly to (e).4 Conc lus ionThe success of our work on Korean further underscoresthe point made by KKZ(Karttnncn, 1992a) thai; themost salient property of two-level morphology is notthe number of levels but the fact two-level rules de-scribe regular elations (just like classical phonologicalrewrite rnles) (Kaplan, 1988; Ritehie, 1992).
Conse-quently, it is possible to combine sets of parallel two-level rules by intersection and merge them with thelexicon and other rule systems in a cascade, of compo-sitions.
The complexities of Korean morphology makeit desirable both tbr linguistic and computational rea-sons to allow for many more intermediate l vels thanassumed in previous works on English and t,~reneh, l{.e-gardless of the nnmber of intervening levels, the out-come is a single lexieal transduce.r thaw directly mapslexical forms to their intlected surface realizations, andvice versa.In the construction of the lexieal automaton for Ko-.rean, we have put two-level rules to a novel use as well-formedness constraints on lexical tbrms.
The sublex-icons from which the LA is constructed contain (tia-critic marks on the outer edge that identify the type ofmorphoh)gical constituents that the lexicon contains.The role of rules in the \[,A constructions i to enforcemorphotaetics and, at the same time, to eliminate thediacritics that encode them.Theoretically, we can get the same LT to composethe morphotactic and phonological >ties all togetherinto one.
rule and compose it with the initial LA orto compose the initial LA with each rule of the morphotaetic and phonological rules one by one in order.Practically, the composition of all the morphotacticand phonologieal rules into one rule causes the combi-natorial explosion of states.
This shows that orderedrules can be used to avoid the combinatorial explosionof states in one two level rule system too.Re ferences\[1\] An|worth, l,;van 1,.
