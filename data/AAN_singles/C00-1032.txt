Relation-al adjectives (RAdj) possess the following well-known linguistic properties:?
they are either denonfinal adjectives - -morphologically derived from a nounthanks to suttix--, or adjectives having anoun usage such as mathdmatique (math-cmatical/mathcmatics).
For the former,not all the adjective-tbrming sufiqxes leadto relational adjectives.
The following suf-tixes are considered by (Dubois, 1962) asappropriate:-ain, -air'e, -al, -el, -estr'c,ien,-icr',-il(e),-in,-ique.
However, (Guy-on, 1993) remarks that a suffix, eventhe most appropriate, is never necessarynor sufficient.
Several adjectives carry-ing a favorable suffix are not relationahthis is the case with the adjectives endingwith -iquc (-ic), which characterize chem-istry and which are not derived from anoun, such as ddsox!/ribonucldique (deoryri-bonucleic), dodecanoiquc Modecanoic), etc.Other suffixes inappropriate are sometimesused such as the suffixes -d and -e'a:~:: car-bone &,'bon) -* car'bon~J (~.a,'bo,,,,eeo'a,~),c,,,,ce," #a,,,cer9 + ca,~c~r'e'a:~ &ancc','o'~,~),etc.?
they own tile possibility, in special condi-tions, of replacing tile attributiw'~ use ofa corresponding prepositional phrase.
Thepreposition employed, as well as tile pres-ence or not of a deternfiner, depends on thehead noun of the noun phrase:aciditd sanguine (blood acidity) ~_ aciditddu sang (acidity of the blood)conqugtc spatiale (space conquest) ~_ con-qu~tc de l'espace (conquest of space)ddbit horairc (hourly rate) ~- ddbit par'heure (rate per" h, our)cxpdrimentations animales (animal experi-mentation) ~ cxpdrimcntations sur lea an-imaux (experimentation on animals)?
and several other properties uch the im-possibility of a predicative position, the ill-compatibility with a degree modification,etc.3 Morphological Rule I nduct ion~lb identify RAdj trough a term extractor, weuse their paraphrastic property which inchldesthe morphological property, the morl)hologicalproperty being insufficient alone.
We need rulesto recover the lemma of the noun fl'om which thelemma of the RAdj has been derived.These rules tbllow the tbllowing schemata:r~ = \[-S +M \]{exceptions} where:S is the relational suffix to be deleted from theend of an adjective.
The result of this dele-tion is the stem R;M is the mutative segment o be concatenatedto R in order to tbrm a noun;except ions  list the adjectives that should notbe submitted to this rule.For example, the rule \[-d -l-e \]{agd} says thatif there is an adjective which ends with d, weshould strip this ending from it and append tilestring c to tile stem except if this a4jective be-longs to tile list of exceptions, namely agd.We extract these mort)hological rules Komthe corpora following the method presented in(Mikheev, 1997) with the difl'erenee that wedon't limit the length of the mutative segmen-t.
The relational suffixes are known, only thenmtative segments have to be guessed.
For tlmlemma of an adjective ending with a relationalsuffix in the corpus Adji, we strip this suffix ofAdji and store the resulting stem ill R. Then,wc try to segment this stein R to each nounNounj at)pearing in the corpus.
If the subtrac-tion result in all non-empty string, the systemcreates a morphological rule where tile muta-tive segment is tile result of the subtraction ofR to Nounj.
We thus obtained couples (Ad.ii,Nounj) associated to a morphological rule.
Forexample: (gazeux, gaz) \[-cux +""\].This schemata doesn't take into account stemalternants uch as:el6 alphabe t/ aph, abd t-ique~/~ hygi~ ne/hygidn-iquee/ i  polle n/polli n-iquex /c  th, orux / thorac-ique216In order to h~mdle this alh)mort)hy, we, use theLcvenshtein's weighted distance (l ,cvenshtcin,1.966) which determines the min imum numl)e,r ofinsertions or deletions of characters to transfor-m one word into another.

variations of the preposition: eh, w-matographie en colonne (columnchrwnatography), chromatographic surcolonne (chrvmatograph, y on col'area);?
optional character of the prepositionand of the z~rticle: fixation azote (hi-trogen fization), fixation d'azote (fiz-ation of nitrogen), fi.~:ation de l~azote(fization of the nitrogen);2.
Intermfl modification variants: insertion in-side the base-term structure of a modifi-er such as the adjective inside the Noun1(Prep (Det)) Nom~2 structure: lair de bre-bis (goat's milk), lait cru de brebis (milkstraigh, t .from the goat);3.
Coordinational w~riants: coordination ofbase term structures: alimentation hu-maine (human diet), alimentation animaleet hnmaine (human and animal diet);4.
Predicative variants: the predicative role ofthe adjective: peetinc mdthylgc (mcthylatepectin), cos pectines ont m6thyldes (thesepectins are metylated).The corpus is tagged and lemmatized.
The pro-gram scans the corpus, counts and extracts col-locations whose syntax characterizes base-termsor one of their variants.
This is done with shal-low parsing using local grammars based on reg-ular expressions (Basili et al, 1993).
Thesegrammars use the morphosyntactie informationassociated with the words of the corpus by thetagger.
The different occurrences are groupedas pairs formed by lemmas of the candidate ter-m and sorted following an association measurewhich takes into account the frequence of theCOOCCtlrrOllCeS.4.2 Term Ext rac tor  mod i f i ca t ionsThe identilication of relational adjective takesplace afl;er extraction of the occurrences of thecandidate terms and their syntactic variation-s.
The algorithm below resmnes the successivesteps tbr identifying relational adjectives:1.
Examine ach candidate of Noun Adj struc-ture;2.
Apply a transtbrmational rule in orderto generate all the possible correspondingbase nouns.
We added morphosyntactieconstraints for some suffixes, such as tbrthe suffix -er, that the identitied adjectiveis not a past-participle;3.
Search the set of candidate terms tbr a pairformed with Nomtl (identical between aNoun1 (Prep (l)?t)) Nou,~2 and a Noun1Adj structures) and Noun2 generated fromstep 2.4.
If step 3 succeeds, group the two base struc-tures mlcter a new candidate term.
Takeout all the Noun Adj structures owing thisadjective from the set; of Noun Adj candi-dates and rename them as a Nomt RAdjstructure.I11 Step 2, morl)hoh)gical rules generate one orseveral nouns tbr a given adjective.
We gener-ate a notllt for each relational suffix class.
Aclass of suffixes includes the allomorphic vari-ants.
This overgeneration method used in in-forlnation retrieval by (aacquemin and Tzouk-ermann, 1999) gives low noise because the basenoun must not only be an attested for in thecorpus, but must also appear as an extension ofa head noun.
