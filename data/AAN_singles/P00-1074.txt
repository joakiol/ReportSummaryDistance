The Philippines is an archipelagowith vast numbers of islands and numerouslanguages.
The tasks of understanding,representing and implementing theselanguages require enormous work.
Anextensive amount of work has been done onunderstanding at least some of the majorPhilippine languages, but little has beendone on the computational aspect.
Majorityof the latter has been on the purpose ofmachine translation.1 Philippine LanguagesWithin the 7,200 islands of the Philippinearchipelago, there are about one hundred andone (101) languages that are spoken.
This isaccording to the nationwide 1995 censusconducted by the National Statistics Office ofthe Philippine Government (NSO, 1997).
Thelanguages that are spoken by at least one percentof the total household population includeTagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Bikol,Waray, Pampanggo or Kapangpangan,Boholano, Pangasinan or Panggalatok, Maranao,Maguin-danao, and Tausug.Aside from these major languages, there areother Philippine dialects, which are variants ofthese major languages.
Fortunato (1993)classified these dialects into the top nine majorlanguages as above (except for Boholano whichis similar to Cebuano).2 Language RepresentationsLinguistics information on Philippinelanguages are extensive on the languagesmentioned above, except for Maranao, Maguin-danao, and Tausug, which are some of thelanguages spoken in Southern Philippines.
Butas of yet, extensive research has already beendone on theoretical linguistics and little isknown for computational linguistics.
In fact, thecomputational linguistics researches onPhilippine languages are mainly focused onTagalog.1  There are also notable work done onIlocano.Kroeger (1993) showed the importance of thegrammatical relations in Tagalog, such assubject and object relations, and theinsufficiency of a surface phrase structureparadigm to represent these relations.
This issuewas further discussed in the LFG98, which is onthe problem of voice and grammatical functionsin Western Austronesian Languages.
Musgrave(1998) introduced the problem certain verbs inthese languages that can head more than onetransitive clause type.
Foley (1998) and Kroeger(1998), in particular, discussed about longdebated issues such as nouns in Tagalog that canbe verbed, the voice system of Tagalog, andTagalog as a symmetrical voice system.Latrouite (2000) argued that a level of semanticrepresentation is still necessary to explicitlycapture a word?s meaning.Crawford (1999) contributed to an issue oninterrogative sentences and suggested that therestriction on wh-movement reveals thesyntactic structure of Tagalog.Potet (1995) and Trost (2000) provided generalmaterials on computational morphology, though,both presented examples on Tagalog.Rubino (1997, 1996) provided an in-depthanalysis of Ilocano.
Among the majorcontributions of the work include an extensivetreatment of the complex morphology in thelanguage, a thorough treatment of the discourse1 Tagalog (or Pilipino) has the most number ofspeakers in the country.
This may be due to the factthat it was officially declared the national l nguage ofthe Philippines in 1946.particles, and the reference grammar of thelanguage.3 Applications in Machine TranslationCurrently, most of the empirical endeavours incomputational linguistics are in machinetranslation.3.1 Filipino MT SoftwareThere are several commercially availabletranslation software, which include Philippinelanguage, but translation is done word-for-word.One such software is the Universal Translator2000, which includes Tagalog among 40 otherlanguages.
Although omni-directional, trans-lation involving Tagalog excludes morpho-logical and syntactic aspects of the languageAnother software is the Filipino LanguageSoftware, which includes Tagalog, Visayan,Cebuano, and Ilocano languages.3.2 Machine Translation ResearchIsaWika!
is an English to Filipino machinetranslator that uses the augmented transitionnetwork as its computational architecture(Roxas, 1999).
It translates simple andcompound declarative statements as well asimperative English statements.
To date, it is thmost serious research undertaking in machinetranslation in the Philippines.Borra (1999) presented another translationsoftware that translates simple declarative andimperative statements from English to Filipino.The computational architecture of the system isbased on LFG, which differs from IsaWika?sATN implementation.
Part of the research wasdescribing a possible set of semantic informationon every grammar category to establish asemantically-close translation.4 ConclusionThere are various theoretical linguistic studieson Philippine languages, but computationallinguistics research is currently limited.
