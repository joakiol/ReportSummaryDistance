The understand-ability of current ASL systems is limited; they have been constructed without the benefit of annotated ASL corpora that encode detailed human movement.
We discuss how linguistic challenges in ASL generation can be ad-dressed in a data-driven manner, and we de-scribe our current work on collecting a motion-capture corpus.
To evaluate the qual-ity of our motion-capture configuration, cali-bration, and recording protocol, we conducted an evaluation study with native ASL signers.
1 Introduction American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary means of communication for about one-half mil-lion deaf people in the U.S. (Mitchell et al, 2006).
ASL has a distinct word-order, syntax, and lexicon from English; it is not a representation of English using the hands.
Although reading is part of the curriculum for deaf students, lack of auditory ex-posure to English during the language-acquisition years of childhood leads to lower literacy for many adults.
In fact, the majority of deaf high school graduates in the U.S. have only a fourth-grade (age 10) English reading level (Traxler, 2000).
1.1 Applications of ASL Generation Research Most technology used by the deaf does not address this literacy issue; many deaf people find it diffi-cult to read the English text on a computer screen or on a television with closed-captioning.
Software to present information in the form of animations of ASL could make information and services more accessible to deaf users, by displaying an animated character performing ASL, rather than English text.
While writing systems for ASL have been proposed (Newkirk, 1987; Sutton, 1998), none is widely used in the Deaf community.
Thus, an ASL generation system cannot produce text output; the system must produce an animation of a human character performing sign language.
Coordinating the simultaneous 3D movements of parts of an animated character?s body is challenging, and few researchers have attempted to build such systems.
Prior work can be divided into two areas: scripting and generation/translation.
Scripting sys-tems allow someone who knows sign language to ?word process?
an animation by assembling a se-quence of signs from a lexicon and adding facial expressions.
The eSIGN project created tools for content developers to build sign databases and as-semble scripts of signing for web pages (Ken-naway et al, 2007).
Sign Smith Studio (Vcom3D, 2010) is a commercial tool for scripting ASL (dis-cussed in section 4).
Others study generation or machine translation (MT) of sign language (Chiu et al, 2007; Elliot & Glauert, 2008; Fotinea et al, 2008; Huenerfauth, 2006; Karpouzis et al, 2007; Marshall & Safar, 2005; Shionome et al, 2005; Sumihiro et al, 2000; van Zijl & Barker, 2003).
Experimental evaluations of the understandabil-ity of state-of-the-art ASL animation systems have shown that native signers often find animations difficult to understand (as measured by compre-89hension questions) or unnatural (as measured by subjective evaluation questions) (Huenerfauth et al, 2008).
Errors include a lack of smooth inter-sign transitions, lack of grammatically-required facial expressions, and inaccurate sign perform-ances related to morphological inflection of signs.
While current ASL animation systems have limitations, there are several advantages in present-ing sign language content in the form of animated virtual human characters, rather than videos: ?
Generation or MT software planning ASL sen-tences cannot just concatenate videos of ASL.
Using video clips, it is difficult to produce smooth transitions between signs, subtle mo-tion variations in sign performances, or proper combinations of facial expressions with signs.
?
If content must be frequently modified or up-dated, then a video performance would need to be largely re-recorded for each modification.
Whereas, an animation (scripted by a human author) could be further edited or modified.
?
Because the face is used to indicate important information in ASL, a human must reveal his or her identity when producing an ASL video.
Instead, a virtual human character could per-form sentences scripted by a human author.
?
For wiki-style applications in which multiple authors are collaborating on information con-tent, ASL videos would be distracting: the per-son performing each sentence may differ.
A virtual human would be more uniform.
?
Animations can be appealing to children for use in educational applications.
?
Animations allow ASL to be viewed at differ-ent angles, at different speeds, or by different virtual humans ?
depending on the preferences of the user.
This can enable education applica-tions in which students learning ASL can prac-tice their ASL comprehension skills.
1.2 ASL is Challenging for NLP Research Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers often apply techniques originally designed for one language to another, but research is not commonly ported to sign languages.
One reason is that with-out a written form for ASL, NLP researchers must produce animation and thus address several issues: ?
Timing: An ASL performance?s speed consists of: the speed of individual sign performances,the transitional time between signs, and the in-sertion of pauses during signing ?
all of which are based on linguistic factors such as syntactic boundaries, repetition of signs in a discourse, and the part-of-speech of signs (Grosjean et al, 1979).
ASL animations whose speed and paus-ing are incorrect are significantly less under-standable to ASL signers (Huenerfauth, 2009).
?
Spatial Reference: Signers arrange invisible placeholders in the space around their body to represent objects or persons under discussion (Meier, 1990).
To perform personal, posses-sive, or reflexive pronouns that refer to these entities, signers later point to these locations.
Signers may not repeat the identity of these en-tities again; so, their conversational partner must remember where they have been placed.
An ASL generator must select which entities should be assigned 3D locations (and where).
?
Inflection: Many verbs change their motion paths to indicate the 3D location where a spa-tial reference point has been established for their subject, object, or both (Padden, 1988).
Generally, the motion paths of these inflecting verbs change so that their direction goes from the subject to the object (Figure 1); however, their paths are more complex than this.
Each verb has a standard motion path that is affected by the subject?s and the object?s 3D locations.
When a verb is inflected in this way, the signer does not need to overtly state the subject/object of a sentence.
An ASL generator must produce appropriately inflected verb paths based on the layout of the spatial reference points.(a.)(b.)
Figure 1: An ASL inflecting verb ?BLAME?
:  (a.)
(person on left) blames (person on right),  (b.)
(person on right) blames (person on left).90?
Coarticulation: As in speech production, the surrounding signs in a sentence affect finger, hand, and body movements.
ASL generators that use overly simple interpolation rules to produce these coarticulation effects yield un-natural and non-fluent ASL animation output.
?
Non-Manuals: Head-tilt and eye-gaze indicate the 3D location of a verb?s subject and object (or other information); facial expressions also indicate negation, questions, topicalization, and other essential syntactic phenomena not conveyed by the hands (Neidle et al, 2000).
Animations without proper facial expressions (and proper timing relative to manual signs) cannot convey the proper meaning of ASL sen-tences in a fluent and understandable manner.
?
Evaluation: With no standard written form for ASL, string-based metrics cannot be used to evaluate ASL generation output automatically.
User-based experiments are necessary, but it is difficult to accurately: screen for native sign-ers, prevent English environmental influences (that affect signer?s linguistic judgments), and design questions that measure comprehension of ASL animations (Huenerfauth et al, 2008).
1.3 Need for Data-Driven ASL Generation Due to these challenges, most prior sign language generation or MT projects have been short-lived, producing few example outputs (Zhao et al, 2000; Veale et al, 1998).
Further developed systems also have limited coverage; e.g., Marshall and Safar (2005) hand-built translation transfer rules from English to British Sign Language.
Huenerfauth (2006) surveys several rule-based systems and dis-cusses how they generally: have limited coverage; often merely concatenate signs; and do not address the Coarticulation, Spatial Reference, Timing, Non-Manuals, or Inflection issues (section 1.2).
Unfortunately, most prior work is not ?data-driven,?
i.e.
not based on statistical modeling of corpora, the dominant successful modern NLP ap-proach.
The sign language generation research that has thus far been the most data-driven includes: ?
Some researchers have used motion-capture (see section 3) to build lexicons of animations of individual signs, e.g.
(Cox et al, 2002).
However, their focus is recording a single cita-tion form of each sign, not creating annotated corpora of full sentences or discourse.
Single-sign recordings do not enable researchers to examine the Timing, Coarticulation, Spatial Reference, Non-Manuals, or Inflection phe-nomena (section 1.2), which operate over mul-tiple signs or sentences in an ASL discourse.
?
Other researchers have examined how statisti-cal MT techniques could be used to translate from a written language to a sign language.
Morrissey and Way (2005) discuss an exam-ple-based MT architecture for Irish Sign Lan-guage, and Stein et al (2006) apply simple statistical MT approaches to German Sign Language.
Unfortunately, the sign language ?corpora?
used in these studies consist of tran-scriptions of the sequence of signs performed, not recordings of actual human performances.
A transcription does not capture subtleties in the 3D movements of the hands, facial move-ments, or speed of an ASL performance.
Such information is needed in order to address the Spatial Reference, Inflection, Coarticulation, Timing, or Non-Manuals issues (section 1.2).
?
Seguoat and Braffort (2009) derive models of coarticulation for French Sign Language based on a semi-automated ?rotoscoping?
annotation of hand location from videos of signing.
1.4 Prior Sign Language Corpora Resources The reason why most prior ASL generation re-search has not been data-driven is that sufficiently detailed and annotated sign language corpora are in short supply and are time-consuming to construct.
Without a writing system in common use, it is not possible to harvest some naturally arising source of ASL ?text?
; instead, it is necessary to record the performance of a signer (through video or a mo-tion-capture suit).
Human signers must then tran-scribe and annotate this data by adding time-stamped linguistic details.
For ASL (Neidle et al, 2000) and European sign languages (Bungeroth et al, 2006; Crasborn et al, 2004, 2006; Efthimiou & Fotinea, 2007), signers have been videotaped and experts marked time spans when events occur ?
e.g.
the right hand is performing the sign ?CAT?
during time index 250-300 milliseconds, and the eyebrows are raised during time index 270-300.
Such annotation is time-consuming to add; the largest ASL corpus has a few thousand sentences.
In order to learn how to control the movements of an animated virtual human based on a corpus,91we need precise hand locations and joint angles of the human signer?s body throughout the perform-ance.
Asking humans to write down 3D angles and coordinates is time-consuming and inexact; some researchers have used computer vision techniques to model the signers?
movements (see survey in (Loeding et al, 2004)).
Unfortunately, the com-plex shape of hands/face, rapid speed, and frequent occlusion of parts of the body during ASL limit the accuracy of vision-based recognition; it is not yet a reliable way to build a 3D model of a signer for a corpus.
Motion-capture technology (discussed in section 3) is required for this level of detail.
2 Research Goals & Focus of This Paper To address the lack of sufficiently detailed and linguistically annotated ASL corpora, we have be-gun a multi-year project to collect and annotate a motion-capture corpus of ASL (section 3).
Digital 3D body movement and handshape data collected from native signers will become a permanent re-search resource for study by NLP researchers and ASL linguists.
This corpus will allow us to create new ASL generation technologies in a data-driven manner by analyzing the subtleties in the motion data and its relationship to the linguistic structure.
Specifically, we plan to model where signers tend to place spatial reference points around them in space.
We also plan to uncover patterns in the mo-tion paths of inflecting verbs and model how they relate to layout of spatial references points.
These models could be used in ASL generation software or could be used to partially automate with work of humans using ASL-scripting systems.
To evaluate our ASL models, native signers will be asked to judge ASL animations produced using them.
There are several unique aspects of our research: ?
We use a novel combination of hand, body, head, and eye motion-tracking technologies and simultaneous video recordings (section 3).
?
We collect multi-sentence single-signer ASL discourse, and we annotate novel linguistic in-formation (relevant to spatial reference points).
?
We involve ASL signers in the research in several ways: as evaluators of our generation software, as research assistants conducting evaluation studies, and as corpus annotators.
This paper will focus on the first of these as-pects of our project.
Specifically, section 4 willexamine the following research question: Have we successfully configured and calibrated our motion-capture equipment so that we are recording good-quality data that will be useful for NLP research?
Since the particular combination of motion-capture equipment we are using is novel and be-cause there have not been prior motion-capture-based ASL corpora projects, section 4 will evaluate whether the data we are collecting is of sufficient quality to drive ASL animations of a virtual human character.
In corpus-creation projects for tradi-tional written/spoken languages, researchers typi-cally gather text, audio, or (sometimes) video of human performances.
The quality of the gathered recordings is typically easier to verify and evalu-ate; for motion-capture data collected with a com-plex configuration of equipment, a more complex experimental design is necessary (section 4).
3 Our Motion-Capture Configuration The first stage of our research is to accurately and efficiently record 3D motion-capture data from ASL signers.
Assuming an ASL signer?s pelvis bone is stationary in 3D space, we want to record movement data for the upper body.
We are inter-ested in the shapes of each hand; the 3D location of the hands; the 3D orientation of the palms; joint angles for the wrists, elbows, shoulders, clavicle, neck, and waist; and a vector representing the eye-gaze aim.
We are using a customized configura-tion of several commercial motion-capture devices (as shown in Figure 2, worn by a human signer): ?
Two Immersion CyberGloves?
: The 22 flexi-ble sensor strips sewn into each of these spandex gloves record finger joint angles so that we can record the signer?s handshapes.
These gloves are ideal for recording ASL be-cause they are flexible and lightweight.
Hu-mans viewing a subject wearing the gloves are able to discern ASL fingerspelling and signing.
?
Applied Science Labs H6 eye-tracker: This lightweight head-mounted eye-tracker with a near-eye camera records a signer?s eye gaze di-rection.
A camera on the headband aims down, and a small clear plastic panel in front of the cheek reflects the image of the subject?s eye.
When combined with the head tracking infor-mation from the IS-900 system below, the H6 identifies a 3D vector of eye-gaze in a room.92?
Intersense IS-900: This acoustical/intertial mo-tion-capture system uses a ceiling-mounted ul-trasonic speaker array and a set of directional microphones on a small sensor to record the location and orientation of the signer?s head.
A sensor sits atop the helmet shown in Figure 2a.
IS-900 data is used to compensate for head movement when calculating eye-gaze direction with the Applied Science Labs H6 eye-tracker.
?
Animazoo IGS-190: This spandex bodysuit is covered with soft Velcro to which small sen-sors attach.
A sensor placed on each segment of the human?s body records inertial and mag-netic information.
Subjects wearing the suit stand facing north with their arms down at their sides at the beginning of the recording session; given this known starting pose and di-rection, the system calculates joint angles for the wrists, elbows, shoulders, clavicle, neck, and waist.
We do not record leg/foot informa-tion in our corpus.
Prior to recording data, we photograph subjects standing in a cube-shaped rig of known size; this allows us to identify bone lengths of the human subject, which are needed for the IGS-190 system to accurately calculate joint angles from the sensor data.
Motion-capture recording sessions are video-taped to facilitate later linguistic analysis and an-notation.
Videotaping the session also facilitates the ?clean up?
of the motion-capture data in post-processing, during which algorithms are applied to adjust synchronization of different sensors or re-move ?jitter?
or other noise artifacts from the re-cording.
Three digital high-speed video camerasfilm front view, facial close-up, and side views of the signer ?
a setup that has been used in video-based ASL-corpora-building projects (Neidle et al, 2000).
The front view is similar to Figure 2a (but wider).
The facial close-up view is useful when later identifying specific non-manual facial expres-sions during ASL performances, which are essen-tial to correctly understanding and annotating the collected data.
To facilitate synchronizing the three video files during post-processing, a strobe is flashed once at the start of the recording session.
A ?blue screen?
curtain hangs on the back and side walls of the motion-capture studio.
If future computer vision researchers wish to use this corpus to study ASL recognition from video, it is useful to have solid color walls for ?chroma key?
back-ground removal.
Photographic studio lighting with spectra compatible with the eye-tracking system is used to support high-quality video recording.
During data collection, a native ASL signer (called the ?prompter?)
sits directly behind the front-view camera to engage the participant wear-ing the suit (the ?performer?)
in natural conversa-tion.
While the corpus we are collecting consists of unscripted single-signer discourse, prior ASL cor-pora projects have identified the importance of sur-rounding signers with an ASL-centric environment during data collection (Neidle et al, 2000).
English influence in the studio must be minimized to pre-vent signers from inadvertently code-switching to an English-like form of signing.
Thus, it is impor-tant that a native signer acts as the prompter, who conversationally suggests topics for the performer to discuss (to be recorded as part of the corpus).a.
b.  c.  Figure 2: (a) Motion-capture equipment configuration, (b) animation produced from motion-capture data (shown in evaluation study), and (c) animation produced using Sign Smith (shown in evaluation study).93In our first year, we have collected and anno-tated 58 passages from 6 signers (40 minutes).
We prefer to collect multi-sentence passages discuss-ing varied numbers of topics and with few ?classi-fier predicates,?
phenomena that aren?t our current research focus.
In (Huenerfauth & Lu, 2010), we discuss details of: the genre of discourse we re-cord, our target linguistic phenomena to capture (spatial reference points and inflected verbs), the types of linguistic annotation added to the corpus, and the effectiveness of different ?prompts?
used to elicit the desired type of spontaneous discourse.
This paper focuses on verifying the quality of the motion-capture data we can record using our current equipment configuration and protocols.
We want to measure how well we have compensated for several possible sources of error in recordings: ?
If a sensor connection is temporarily lost, then data gaps occur.
We have selected equipment that does not require line-of-sight connections and tried to arrange the studio to avoid fre-quent dropping of any wireless connections.
?
We ask subjects to perform a quick head movement and distinctive eye blink pattern at the beginning of the recording session to facili-tate ?synchronization?
of the various motion-capture data streams during post-processing.
?
Electronic and physical properties of sensors can lead to ?noise?
in the data, which we at-tempt to remove with smoothing algorithms.
?
Differences between the bone lengths of the human and the ?virtual skeleton?
of the ani-mated character being recorded could lead to ?retargeting?
errors, in which the body poses of the human do not match the recording.
We must be careful in the measurement of the bone lengths of the human participant and in the design of the virtual animation skeleton.
?
To compensate for differences in how equip-ment sits on the body on different occasions or on different humans, we must set ?calibration?
values; e.g., we designed a novel protocol for efficiently and accurately calibrating gloves for ASL signers (Lu & Huenerfauth, 2009).
4 Evaluating Our Collected Motion Data If a speech synthesis researcher were using a novel microphone technology to record audio perform-ances from human speakers to build a corpus, thatresearcher would want to experimentally confirm that the audio recordings were of high enough quality for research.
Even when perfectly clear audio recordings of human speech are recorded in a corpus, the automatic speech synthesis models trained on this data are not perfect.
Degradations in the quality of the corpus would yield even lower quality speech synthesis systems.
In the same way, it is essential that we evaluate the quality of the ASL motion-capture data we are collecting.
In an earlier study, we sought to collect motion-data from humans and directly produce animations from them as an ?upper baseline?
for an experi-mental study (Huenerfauth, 2006).
We were not analyzing the collected data or using it for data-driven generation, we merely wanted the data to directly drive an animation of a virtual human character as a ?virtual puppet.?
This earlier project used a different configuration of motion-capture equipment, including an earlier version of Cyber-Gloves?
and an optical motion-capture system that required line-of-sight connections between infrared emitters on the signer?s body and cameras around the room.
Unfortunately, the data collected was so poor that the animations produced from the mo-tion-capture were not an ?upper?
baseline ?
in fact, they were barely understandable to native signers.
Errors arose from dropped connections, poor cali-bration, and insufficient removal of data noise.
We have selected different equipment and have designed better protocols for recording high quality ASL data since that earlier study ?
to compensate for the ?noise,?
?retargeting,?
?synchronization,?
and ?calibration?
issues mentioned in section 3.
However, we know that under some recording conditions, the quality of collected motion-capture data is so poor that ?virtual puppet?
animations synthesized from it are not understandable.
We expect that an even higher level of data quality is needed for a motion-capture corpus, which will be analyzed and manipulated in order to synthesize novel ASL animations from it.
Therefore, we con-ducted a study (discussed below) to evaluate the quality of our current motion-capture configura-tion.
As in our past study, we use the motion-capture data to directly control the body move-ments of a virtual human ?puppet.?
We then ask native ASL signers to evaluate the understandabil-ity and naturalness of the resulting animations (and compare them to some baseline animations pro-duced using ASL-animation scripting software).94In our prior work, a native ASL signer designed a set of ASL stories and corresponding compre-hension questions for use in evaluation studies (Huenerfauth, 2009).
The stories?
average length is approximately 70 signs, and they consist of news stories, encyclopedia articles, and short narratives.
We produced animations of each using Sign Smith Studio (SSS), commercial ASL-animation script-ing software (Vcom3D, 2010).
Signs from SSS?s lexicon are placed on a timeline, and linguistically appropriate facial expressions are added.
The soft-ware synthesizes an animation of a virtual human performing the story (Figure 2c).
In earlier work, we designed algorithms for determining sign-speed and pause-insertion in ASL animations based on linguistic features of the sentence.
We conducted a study to compare animations with default timing settings (uniform pauses and speed) and anima-tions governed by our timing algorithm ?
at vari-ous speeds.
The use of our timing algorithm yielded ASL animations that native signers found more understandable (Huenerfauth, 2009).
We are reusing these stories and animations as baselines for comparison in a new evaluation study (below).
While we are collecting unscripted passages in our corpus, it is easier to compare the quality of different versions of animations when using a common set of scripted stories.
Thus, we used the script from 10 of the stories above, and each was performed by a native signer, a 22-year-old male who learned ASL prior to age 2.
He wore the full set of motion-capture equipment, and we followed the same calibration process and protocols as we do when recording ASL passages for our corpus.
The signer rehearsed and memorized each story; ?cue cards?
were also available when recording.Autodesk MotionBuilder software was used to produce a virtual human whose movements were driven by the motion-capture data (see Figure 2b).
While our corpus contains video of facial expres-sion, our motion-capture equipment does not digit-ize it; so, the virtual human character has no facial movements.
The recorded signer moved at an av-erage speed of 1.12 signs/second, and so for com-parison, we selected the version of the scripted ASL animations with the closest speed from our earlier study: 1.2 signs/second.
(Since the scripted animations are slightly slower and include linguis-tic facial expressions, we expected them to receive higher understandability scores than our motion-capture animations.)
In our earlier work, we pro-duced two versions of each scripted story: one with default timing and one with our novel timing algo-rithm.
Both versions are used as baselines for comparison in this new study; thus, we compare three versions of the same set of 10 ASL stories.
Using questions designed to screen for native ASL signers developed in prior work (Huenerfauth et al, 2008), we recruited 12 participants to evalu-ate the ASL animations.
A native ASL signer con-ducted the studies, in which participants viewed an animation and were then asked two types of ques-tions after each: (1) ten-point Likert-scale ques-tions about the ASL animation?s grammatical correctness, understandability, and naturalness of movement and (2) multiple-choice comprehension questions about basic facts from the story.
The comprehension questions were presented in the form of scripted ASL animations (produced in SSS), and answer choices were presented in the form of clip-art images (so that strong English lit-eracy was not necessary).
Identical questions wereFigure 3: Evaluation and comprehension scores (asterisks mark significant pairwise differences).95used to evaluate the motion-capture animations and the scripted animations.
Examples of the questions are included in (Huenerfauth, 2009).
Figure 3 displays results of the Likert-scale sub-jective questions and comprehension-question suc-cess scores for the three types of animations evaluated in this study.
The scripted animations using our timing algorithm have higher compre-hension scores, but the motion-capture animations have higher naturalness scores.
All of the other scores for the animations are quite similar.
Statisti-cally significant differences are marked with an asterisk (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney pairwise compari-sons with Bonferroni-corrected p-values).
Non-parameteric tests were selected because the Likert-scale responses were not normally distributed.
5 Conclusion and Future Research Goals The research question addressed by this paper was whether our motion-capture configuration and re-cording protocols enabled us to collect motion-data of sufficient quality for data-driven ASL genera-tion research.
In our study, the evaluation scores of the animations driven by the motion-capture data were similar to those of animations produced using state-of-the-art ASL animation scripting software.
This is a promising result, especially considering the slightly faster speed and lack of facial expres-sion information in the motion-capture animations.
While this suggests that the data we are collecting is of good quality, the real test will be when this corpus is used in future research.
If we can build useful ASL-animation generation software based on analysis of this corpus, then we will know that we have sufficient quality of motion-capture data.
5.1 Our Long-Term Research Goal: Making ASL Accessible to More NLP Researchers It is our goal to produce high-quality broad-coverage ASL generation software, which would benefit many deaf individuals with low English literacy.
However, this ambition is too large for any one team; for this technology to become real-ity, ASL must become a language commonly stud-ied by NLP researchers.
For this reason, we seek to build ASL software, models, and experimental techniques to serve as a resource for other NLP researchers.
Our goal is to make ASL ?accessible?
to the NLP community.
By developing tools to address some of the modality-specific and spatialaspects of ASL, we can make it easier for other researchers to transfer their new NLP techniques to ASL.
The goal is to ?normalize?
ASL in the eyes of the NLP community.
Bridging NLP and ASL research will not only benefit deaf users: ASL will push the limits of current NLP techniques and will thus benefit other work in the field of NLP.
Sec-tion 1.2 listed six challenges for ASL NLP re-search; we address several of these in our research: We have conducted many experimental studies in which signers evaluate the understandability and naturalness of ASL animations (Huenerfauth et al, 2008; Huenerfauth, 2009).
To begin to address the Evaluation issue (section 1.2), we have published best-practices, survey materials, and experimental protocols for effectively evaluating ASL animation systems through the participation of native signers.
We have also published baseline comprehension scores for ASL animations.
We will continue to produce such resources in future work.
Our earlier work on timing algorithms for ASL animations (mentioned in section 4) was based on data reported in the linguistics literature (Grosjean et al, 1979).
In future work, we want to learn tim-ing models directly from our collected corpus ?
to further address the Timing issue (section 1.2).
To address the issues of Spatial Reference and Inflection (section 1.2), we plan on analyzing our ASL corpus to build models that can predict where in 3D space signers establish spatial reference points.
Further, we will analyze our corpus to ana-lyze how certain ASL verbs are inflected based on the 3D location of their subject and object.
We want to build a parameterized lexicon of ASL verbs: given a 3D location for subject and object, we want to predict a 3D motion-path for the char-acter?s hands for a specific performance of a verb.
While addressing the issues of Coarticulation and Non-Manuals (section 1.2) are not immediate research priorities, we believe our ASL corpus may also be useful in building computational models of these phenomena for data-driven ASL generation.
