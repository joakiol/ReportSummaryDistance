Text documents are generally cb~ssifiedby significant words (keywords) of the documents.However, it is difficult to extract these significantwords from Japanese text, because Japanese textsare written without using blank spaces, such as de-limiters, and must be segmented into words.
There-fore, instead of words, we used domain specific kanjicharacters which appear more frequently in one do-main than the other.
We extracted these domainspecific kanji characters by X ,2 method.
Then, us-ing these domain specific kanji characters, we clas-sifted editorial columns "TENSEI J INGO", edito-rim articles, and articles in "Scientific American (inJapanese)".
The correct recognition scores for' themwere 47%, 74%, and 85%, respectively.1 In t roduct ionDocument cl~sification has been widely investigatedfor assigning domains to documents for text retrieval,or aiding human editors in assigning such domains.Various successful systems have been developed toclassify text documents (Blosseville, 1992; Guthrie,1994; Ilamill, 1980; Masand, 1992; Young, 1985).Conventional way to develop document classifica-tion systems can be divided into the following twogroups:1. semantic approach2.
statistical approachIn the semantic approach, document classification isbased on words and keywords of a thesaurus.
If thethesaurus i constructed well, high score is achieved.But this approach as disadvantages in terms of de-velopment and maintenance.
On the other hand, inthe statistical approach, a human exl)ert classifiesa sample set of documents into predefined omains,and the computer learns from these samples howto classify documents into these domains.
'\]'his ap-proach offers advantages in terms of developmentand maintenance, but the quality of the results isnot good enough in comparison with the semanticapproach.
In either approach, document classifica-tion using words has problems as follows:1.
Words in the documents must be normalizedfor matching those in the dictionary and thethesaurus.
Moreover, in the case of Japanesetexts, it is difficult to extract words from them,because they are written without using blankspaces as delimiters and must be segmentedinto words.2.
A simple word extraction technique generatesto() many words.
In the statistical approach,the dimensions of tim training space are toobig au(l tim classification process usually fails.Therefore, the.
Jal)anese document classification onwords needs a high l)recision Japanese morpholog-ical analyzer and a great amount of lexical knowl-edge.
Considering these disadvantages, we proposea new method of document classification on kanficharacter,s, on which document classification is per-formed without a morphological analyzer and lexi-eel knowledge.
In our approach, we extracted o-main specific kanji characters for' document classi-fication by the X 2 metho(I.
The features of docu-lnents and domains are rel-)resented using the tim_ture space the axes of which are these domain spe-cific kanji characters.
Then, we classified Japanesedocuments into domains by mea~suring the similar-ity between ew documents and the domains in thefeature space.2 Document  C lass i f icat ion onDomain  Specif ic  Kanj i  Characters2.1 Text  Representat ion  t)y Kanj iCharactersIn previous researches, texts were represented bysignificarlt woMs, and a word was regarded as a min-immn semantic unit.
But a word is not a minimumsemantic unit, because a word consists of one ormore morphemes.
Here, we propose the text repre-sentation by morpheme.
We have applied this ideato the Japanese text representation, where a kanjicharacter is a morpheme.
Each kanji character hasits meaning, and Japanese words (nouns, verbs, ad-jectives, and so on) usually contain one or morekanji characters which represent the meaning of thewords to some extent.When representing the features of a text by kanjicharacters, it is important o consider which kanjicharacters are significant for the text representationand useful for classification.
We assumed that thesesignificant kanji characters appear more frequently794samp!e setofJapanese texts2 x methodinput/g/?d #/feature space / /for " /document /" /" ,#classification ' ,' /' / ,,'""/////" ,,,// .........measure the similarit yl'?

\[f the document classification is lJerforined Oilkanji characters, we may avoid the two problenlsdescribed in Section 1.1.
It is simpler to extract ka, iji characters than tOextract Japanese words.2.
There are about 2,000 kanji char~tcte,'s thatare considered neccssary h)r general literacy.So, the rnaximuln number of dimensiolis of thetraining space is about 2,000.Of course, in our approach, the quality of theresults may not be as good as lit the i)revh)us al)-preaches ilSilig the words.

So, it is difficult to extract appropriatedomain specific kanji characters from the articleswhich are classified into the authors' specialties.Therefore, it is important to consider that 206specialties in the encyclopedia, which represent al-most a half of the specialties, are used as the sub-jects of the domain in the Nippon Decimal Classifi-cation (NDC).
For example, botany, which is one ofthe authors' specialties, is also one of the subjectsof the domain in the NDC.
In addition to this,the NDC has hierarchical domains.
For keepiug thedomains well balanced, we combined the specialtiesusing the hierarchical relationship of the NDC.
Theprocedure for combining the specialties i as follows:1.
We aligned the specialties to the domains in theNDC.
206 specialties corresponded to the do-mains of the NDC automatically, and the restwas aligned manually.2.
We combined 418 specialties to 59 code do-mains of the NDC, using its hierarchical re-lationship.
'Fable 1 shows an example of thehierarchical relationship of the NDC.However, 59 domains are not well balanced.
For ex-ample, "physics", "electric engineering", and "Ger-man literature" are the code domains of the NDC,and we know these domains are not well balancedby intuition.
So, for keeping the domains well bal-anced, we combined 59 domains to 42 manually.3.2 Se lect ion of  Domain  Specif ic Kan j iCharacters  by  the X 2 MethodUsing the value X 2 of the X 2 test, we can detectthe unevenly distributed kanji characters and ex-tract these kanji characters as domain specific kanjicharacters.
Indeed, it was verified that X ~ methodis useful for extracting keywords instead of kanjicharacters(Nagao, 1976).Suppose we denote the frequency of kanji i inthe domain j ,  mid,  and we assume that kanji i isdistributed evenly.
Then the value X 2 ofkanji i, X~,is expressed by the equations as follows:Ij= ld _ ( * 'd  (4)rlzij1xi j  kj= lmid-  k , x~.it (s)i=1 d : lwhere k is the number of varieties of the kanji char-acters and 1 is tile number of the domains.
If thevalue X/2 is relatively big, we consider that the kanjii is distributed unevenly.There are two considerations about the extrac-tion of the domain specific kanji characters usingthe X 2 method.
The first is the size of the trainingsamples.
If the size of each training sample is differ-ent, the ranking of domain specific kanji charactersis not equal to tile ranking of tile value X 2.
'File sec-ond is that we cannot recognize which domains arerepresented by the extracted kanji characters usingonly the value X :~ of equation (3).
In other words,there is no guarantee that we can extract the ap-propriate domain specific kanji characters from ev-ery domain.
From this, we have extracted the fixednumber of domain specific kanji characters from ev-ery domain using the ranking of the value X~ d ofequation (4) instead of (3).
Not only the value X~of equation (3) but the value X~ d of equation (4) be-come big when the kanji i appears more frequentlyin the domain j than in the other.
Table 2 showstop 20 domain specific kanji characters of the 42domains.
Further, Appendix shows tim meaningsof each domain specific kanji character of "libraryscience" domain.3.3 Feature  Space for the DocmnentClass i f icat ionIn order to measure the closeness between an un-classified document and the 42 domains, we pro-posed a feature space the axes of which are domainspecific kanji characters extracted from the 42 do-mains.
To represent the features of an unclassifieddocument and the 42 domains, we used feature vec-tot's (1) and (2) respectively.
To find out the closestdomain, we measured an angle between the unclas-sifted document and the 42 domains in the featurespace.
If we are given a new document he featurevector of which is x, the classification system cancompute the angle 0 with each vector vi which rep-resents the domain iand find vi withrain 0 ( vi , z ) .iUsing this procedure, every document is classifiedinto the closest domain.796TaMe 1: Division of the Nippon Decimal Chtssification- technology/engineering (:lass .

The articles of "TENSEI J INGO" and tileeditorial articles are classified by editors into a hi-797erarchy of domains which differ from the domainsof the NDC.
We aligned these domains to the 42domains described in Section 3.1.
Some articles inthereof contain two or more themes, and these arti-cles are classified into two or more domains by edi-tors.
For example, the editorial article 'qbo ManyKatakana Words" is classified into three domains.In these cases, we.j,dge that the result of the au-tomatic classification is correct when it correspondsto one of the domains where the document is cbLs-sifted by editors.
Figure 3 , Figure 4, and Figure 5describe the variations of the classification resultswith respect o the number of domain specific kanjicharacters.4.2 Eva luat ionIn our approach, the maximum correct recognitionscores for the editorial articles and the articles in"Scientific American (in Japanese)" are 74 % and 85%, respectively.
Considering that our system usesonly the statistical information of kanji charactersand deals with a great amount of documents whichcover various specialties, our approach achieved agood result in document classification.
From this,we believe that our approach is efficient for broadlyclassifying various subjects of the documents, e.g.news stories.
A method for classifying news storiesis significant for distributing and retrieving articlesin electronic newspaper.The maximum recognition scores for "TENSEIJ INGO" is 47 %.
The reasons why the result is farworse than the results of the other are:1.
The style of the documentsThe style of "TENSEI ,lINGO" is similar tothat of an essay or a novel and it is written incolloquial Japanese.
In contrast, the style ofthe editorial articles and "Scientific American(in Japanese)" is similar to that of a thesis.
Wethink the reason why we achieved the good re-sult in the classification of the editorial articlesand "Scientific American (in Japanese)" is thatmany technical terms are used in there and it islikely that the kanji characters which representthe technical terms are domain specific kanjicharacters in that domain.2.
Two or more themes in one documentMany articles of "TENSEI J INGO" contain twoor more themes.
In these articles, it is usualthat the introductory part has little relationto the main theme.
For example, the article"Splendid ILetirement", whose main theme isthe Speaker's resignation of the llouse of Rep-resentatives, ha~s an introductory part aboutthe retirement of famous sportsmen.
In conclu-sion, our aplJroach is not effective in classifyingthese articles.However, if we divide these articles into se-mantic objects, e.g.
chapter and section, thesesemantic objects may be classified in our ap-proach.

We would also like to study the relationbetween tile quality of the classification result andthe size of the documents.ReferencesBlosseville M.J, It6brail G., Monteil M.G., Pdnot N.:"Autontatic Document Classilleation: Natural l,an-guage Processing, St~ttistical Analysis, ~tnd ExpertSystem Techniques used together", SI(',IR '92, Pl).51- 58, 1992.Gnthrie I,., Walker E., Guthrie J.: "I)OCUM I",NT CI,ASSIFICATION BY MACIIINE:Theory and Practice",COLING 94, pp.
