M. MENNUCCI- E. MORREALEAN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR.
STEM-SUFFIXDISCRIMINATION IN ITALIAN WORDS1.
Introduction.Today, owing to the growing diffusion of on-line processing faci-lities, the automatic processing of textual data, i.e.
of information ex-pressed in natural anguage, becomes more and more important bothfor:1) applications concerning specifically the processing of textualfragments, (studies in linguistic analysis, in information retrieval andquestion-answering systems, etc.
);2) the implementation f a viable communication process withininteractive systems also for problems not specifically linguistic, (suchas computer aided instruction, computer aided design, etc.
), so that nonspecialized people can access and use the system without the burdenof some more or less rigidly coded command language.A typical application which combines both of the above aspectscan be found in a hospital where the collection and the analysis of cli-nical data is to be performed automatically.
This will be accomplishedby a combined hardware-software system capable to process and ana-lyze clinical data expressed in narrative form, e.g.
the patients' anam-neses; it should furthermore enable the sanitary staff of the hospital touse some form of on-line communication language as explicit as pos-sible.Any significant processing of information expressed in naturallanguage requires one be able to perform some kind of content analysison the input data, and to infer some significant associations betweenthese data and particular actions which are considered pertinent in agiven context.
For instance, in the case of the hospital system mentionedbefore, the content analysis of patients' anamneses should make it poss-ible to relate the textual data composing an anarmlesis with the clinicalaspects considered useful for the possible diagnosis and therapy.19290 M. MENNUCCI"  \]~.
MORREALEThe content analysis to be performed on a text requires that bothsyntactic and semantic features of the text be simultaneously analyzed:- the syntactic features will lead to the recognition of the simplelinguistic elements forming the given, more complex, one;- the semantic features will assodate with the different linguisticelements, composing the text, concepts and actions which are relevantfor the particular context in which the text is analyzed; for instance theclinical context in the case of an anamnesis.In the case of artificial anguages, it has become customary to ana-lyze separately these two kinds of features.
The much greater complex-ity of natural languages consists essentially in the fact that such asharp distinction between these two kinds of features can no longerbe made, and therefore, the analysis will require a more unified pro-cedure.The necessity of a combined syntactic and" semantic" analysis ari-ses even at the very preliminary level we are considering in this work,i.e.
at the level of the morphological nalysis of the words composinga text.
More precisely, we shall consider the problem of an automaticmorphological nalysis of Italian words, and hence the computer-aidedconstruction of an Italian morphological dictionary.The necessity of a combined analysis, as mentioned before, arisesalready at this level as a consequence of the fact that the stem of a wordcarries the bulk of its semantic value, while the various suffixes that canbe appended to it must follow specific morphological rules; they are,furthermore, related to the possible syntactic uses of the word in a sen-tence and determine, at the same time, its precise meaning in the text.Actually, from such a dictionary, one would obtain for any Italianword  ;- s o m e  grammatical qualifications uch as substantive, adjective,verb, singular, plural, masculine, feminine, tense, person etc.
;- some semantic qualifications specify!ng which kinds of relationstie together this word with some other words in the dictionary, accor-ding to the particular context in which the text is analyzed.In such a way, after stem-suffix analysis has been made, grammaticalqualifications will mainly result from suffix structures which are com-mon to all the words of the language, while semantic qualifications inany given context will depend only on stems.
Therefore the semanticrelations constituting these qualifications will be built around the setof stems contained in the dictionary.According to the above remarks, our work has been oriented to-AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFHX DISCRIMINATION 291ward the study of the flexive structure of Italian words, i.e.
the struc-ture according to which, from a single stem, through affixing it witha set of different su~xes, a set of different forms can be derived, eachone being qualified by convenient grammatical categories.The problem of building a morphological dictionary is consideredhere more from the Information Science point of view than from thelinguistic point of view.
More precisely, our attention has been mainlyfocused on the problem of giving some automatic assistance to humanoperators engaged in the construction of a morphological dictionary,and an interactive system has actually been studied for this purpose.This system has been planned for languages which, like Italian, havea richly flexive structure.In the present paper, after some short comments about the utilityof automatic morphological nalysis and the different approaches whichcan be followed in constructing an Italian morphological dictionary(sec.
2), we give the description of the proposed system (sec.
3) andsome concluding remarks (sec.
4).2.
Computer aided construction of a morphological dictionary.Morphology is that part of linguistics which studies word forma-tion and provides us with rules and explanation about the internalstructure of a word.
Such information about the internal structure ofwords can be very useful in the analysis of a text at least in four majorareas:1) It helps us control the widening, enrichening and modifica-tion of the concepts used within the universe of discourse which isspecific to any application context in which textual analysis is perfor-med.
In a system in which no morphological nalysis is provided anyword is considered merely as a "sequence of characters ", each oneindependent from the others; therefore the addition of any new wordwill be considered merely as the addition of a new entry to a list ofwords, even if the new word is simply a new derivation of a stem alreadypresent in the dictionary through one or more of its forms.Furthermore the use of morphological nalysis allows one to givesemantic qualifications to the stems instead of to the forms, facilitatingthus both a more compact and uniform treatment of semantics andthe recognition of similarity among aggregates as:292 M. MI~NNUCCI-  E. MORREALEmatematica pplicataapplicazione della matematicaapplicare la matematicaapplicazioni matematiche.2) In languages possessing a rich flexional structure - like Ita-lian - it allows a significant compression i the dimension of the wholedictionary; in languages like Russian or Finnish a ratio between 10-20can be estimated between a full form and a stem dictionary.3) It allows the automatic expansion of words in their full fie-xional schemes.4) It allows an easier and more uniform association of grammaticalcategories to the forms composing a text, so that subsequent s eps fora more comprehensive content analysis can reach more significant re-sults, even when hampered by some not yet encountered form.In order to perform an automated morphological nalysis of alanguage, it is mandatory to have a morphological dictionary of thatlanguage, i.e.
a tabulated and/or algorithmic means, allowing the dis-tinction of stem and affixes within a word.Without entering here into a complete analysis of such dictionary-creating processes, we can agree on the fact that these processes canbe complex and long, in accordance with the large number of formsto be considered and the large number of affixional structures whichmust be taken into account.It can therefore be obvious to ask whether one could receive someoperational help from some automatic means in constructing this dic-tionary, and it is in this direction that our approach as been mainlyoriented.In the case of the construction ofa general morphological dictionary,perhaps the most immediate approach could be that of starting froma conventional dictionary and expanding all its entries in all their poss-ible forms, according to a set of flexional structures taken from a con-ventional grammar.
The situation appears omehow different when thedictionary is to be used in some specific field of application, for instancethat of anamneses analysis in a particular medical field.
In fact, in thiscase it is very difficult to reach any a priori decision about:1) the selection of the specific words to be included in thedictionary;2) the selection of the non-specific words to be included in thedictionary:AN" INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFFIX DISCRIMINATION 2933) the selection of the flexional structures to be considered forthe expansion of the above words.On the other hand, in ahnost all applications of such kinds, one hasa quite large and significant sample of text fragments to analyze, whichin some way explicitly defines the area in which linguistic analysisshould be made.According to such considerations, the guidelines which seemed tous worth following for the computer-assisted construction of a diction-ary, can be condensed as follows:1) to start from the collection of text fragments which are al-ready available, i.e.
from a set of forms, assuming, as we have verified,that in such texts many forms derived from the same stein are present;2) to apply some automatic mechanism which can put in evi-dence, as much as possible, the strong regularities which are character-istic of the Italian morphology, so that human decisions can be ap-plied to classes of words, and to exceptions;3) to try to take into account as many as possible of the regularitiesand of the exceptions explicitly outlined by a conventional grammar,in order to enhance the efficiency of the above process.Therefore, according to the explicit indications (examples) givenby a conventional grammar, two sets, E and lk, of words will be formed:- the exlusion list E, which will contain all those words for whichno, or very individual behaviour, is indicated;- the regu/arity list R, which will contain some flexionally com-plete samples (hereafter to be called "templates ") for any flexionalstructure which is representative of a large class of words.For a specific application to a certain field, for which we have acollection of text-fragments, we shall, first of all, build the set S ofall forms contained in it, subtract from S tile elements belonging to E,and add to it the elements of lk; the resulting set will be the input forthe system, to be processed as described in the next section.3.
Description of the system.We shall assume that the text sample to be processed includes, fora significant number of stems, a sufficient number of derived forms, sothat the extraction of a significant number of flexional structures isat least in principle feasible.The basic structure of the system can be schematized asin Fig.

In our sy-stem, the realization of this data structure is performed by step 1,which reads the different forms and builds up the initial tree T. Atthe end of the Ith iteration the input tree T~., will be processed and tran-sformed into the new one T, which possibly will be processed simi-larly by the next iteration.
Obviously, forms derived from the samestem constitute a subtree of the whole tree (see Fig.
3).
In such a subtree,unless it is an improper one, we distinguish:- a "cut node" (c.n.
), i.e.
the leftmost branching node in the tree;- a stem, i.e.
the sequence of characters preceding and includingthe c.n.
;- a "flexional structure ", i.e.
the set of branches starting fromthe c.n.

4AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFFIX DISCRIMINATION 2971) the "left part" coincides with the stem; the "right structure"coincides with the flexional structure; no further operations are needed;2) the "left part" contains the stem plus some characters of theflexional structure; the "right structure" is properly contained in theflexional structure; further iterations are needed;3) the forms in the subtree are not derived from the same stemand the structure must be rejected.We are actually interested in extracting, fiom the given set offorms, all the subtrees related to the same stem, possibly after havingwidened these subtrees to their largest linguistically consistent expan-sion, so that both the left part and the associated flexional structure reachtheir most stable form.
For this purpose, two basic operations must beperformed:1) extraction o f -  even incomplete - subtrees related to the samestem; this process will result essentially from the, possibly iterated,extraction o f "  minimal subtrees " to be defined below;2) widening, as much as possible, of the flexional structuresextracted before; this process will benefit from the introduced templates,and will require some amount of interaction with the operator.In order to describe the functions performed in step 2, let us definea "minimal subtree" of a given tree as the tree of all (at least two)branches which emerge from the same node, and which do not giverise to any other proper branching.
Let us call "f ight part" any setof characters constituting a branch in a minimal subtree, and "rightstructure" the set of all right parts in a minimal subtree.The result of applying step 2 to our example is shown in Fig.
2,where all minimal subtreees have been marked by bold lines.
As thisexample shows, the majority of minimal subtrees o extracted referto the same stem, and this result has beeen strongly conftrmed by ourexperience on Italian words.

SAccording to this discussion, the required filtering of minimal sub-trees resulting from step 2 is performed by step 3, mainly on the basisof the number of occurrences of structures and of their terminations,and under the control of the operator.Let o = {~1, "r2 ........ , .r~} denote any structure composed of k ter-minations n "~ ....... ~, and let ~(o) and c0(.~) denote the number of oc-cttrrences of a given structure o and of a given termination "~ respe-ctively.
Assuming that two threshold values  and t < s have been sele-cted for the number of  occurrences of structures and terminationsrespectively, the filtering of structures i performed as follows: for anystructure1) if c0(~)>s then the structure o is retained;in the case c~ (0)~< s the occurrences ~('r,) of terminations "~, arematched against he threshold t, and decisions are taken according toone of the following three possible outcomes:2a) ifc0(.~i)>t for i=  1, k, then the structure o is retained;2b) If c0('r~) ~<t for i = 1, k, then the structure ~ is rejected;2c) in the remaining case, the set o = {vl, "ca ..., "?~} is properlypartitioned by the threshold into two non empty subsets o' --- {vl, "~i...,AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR STEM-SUFFIX DISCRIMINATION 299-g,} with c0(v:)>t, and ~" = {'d', "~',' ..... -c;',} with ~0(~-;') < t, and oneof the three following actions can be optionally applied:- the structure ~ is rejected;- only the substructure e' is retained;- the structure is displayed and further decisions about it are leftto the operator.The above filtering scheme could be further refined by taking intoaccount even some other parameters, as for instance: the length (num-ber of characters), or the mean length of the right parts within thestructure ~.After this selection step, all the words related to rejected structureswill be removed from the tree, and will be collected as a part of theoutput of  the system.In any iteration, after partial flexional structures have been detectedand selected by steps 2 and 3, step 4 will perform the possible wideningof these structures as follows, on the basis of similarity matching bet-ween structures and under operator control.
For every pair of structures~, %.
i # j a similarity value X(~, e~) is computed through a properlyselected function X, which evaluates the similarities between two stru-ctures.
For instance one could select:or  e lse :where:(c c)X= max N~ + C ' Nj.

6)N= ~ ~ ~ ~ %'-7According to the decreasing order of their similarity values, pairsof structures % ~ are displayed to the operator, for decision about thepossibility of widening cr i and/or ~i in the structure ?~ U %.
In this phase,the operator can communicate his decisions through a set of commandswhich allow him to manipulate structures, transfer forms from a struc-ture to another, etc.
Commands will be also provided for displayingentities (structures, forms related to a given structure, etc.)

7 .teen uppermost forms shown in Fig.
2 have been submitted to the sy-stem.
The set of structures formed by the first iteration would be theone shown in Fig.
7 under level 1.
When these structures have beendetected (for the sake of simplicity we have omitted the effects of pos-sible expansions eventually generated by step 4), each one of them willbe condensed in a single node representing the identification of thatstructure and new iterations will then be applied.
In this way, all thefurther levels, shown in Fig.
7, of the flexional structure will succes-sively emerge, converging at the end to a stable left part (stem) and astable right structure (flexional structure) associated with it.In any new iteration, as already remarked about step 3, the form treeTo will be progressively stripped of some forms, and the process willstop when it vanishes.
At this point, all the material resulting from theprocess, i.e.
left parts and flexional structures, will constitute a basesuitably structured to zecelve the grammatical qualifications neededin a morphological dictionary.302 M, MENNUCCI - E. MORREALE4.
Concluding remarks.Some parts (steps 1, 2) of the system described above have alreadybeen implemented, while implementation is presently under way forthe others (steps 3,4).
The set of commands already implemented allowsone to perform, on a non automatic basis, all the interactive operationsby steps 3 and 4.At the present stage of implementation, a teletype is used for theinteraction.
However, in order to speed up the interactive conmmnica-tion, the use of an alphanumeric video display equipped with a lightpen, is planned.So far some experiments have been made with the implementedparts of the system, by processing a small sample of texts, i.e.
30 neuro-logical anamneses including about 2000 forms.
These tests, even thoughincomplete, have shown that the process of grouping together formsderived from the same stem is largely satisfactory, as it has given afterthe first application of steps 1,2 and 3 (in a non-automatical version),a very low fraction of still incorrect groups, i.e.
groups of forms nonderivable from the same stem.These preliminary results allow us to think that, after the implemen-tation of the interactive portion of the system is completed, the systemitself can be a useful tool for building morphological dictionaries forspecific applications involving the analysis of textual data expressedin a richly flexive language as Italian.
The main advantages that sucha system can offer can be summarized in the following points:1) The textual data to be analyzed constitute by themselves theinput to the system, and no further input is required;2) human operations are restricted mainly to validating and/ormodifying structures already prepared by the system;3) manual interventions can be applied to whole classes of mor-phologically homogeneous forms;4) grammatical qualifications can be applied to whole classesof morphologically homogeneous forms.'
