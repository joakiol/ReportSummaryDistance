Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Computational Terminology, pages 68?76,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.A comparative User Evaluation ofTerminology Management Tools for InterpretersHernani Costa?Gloria Corpas PastorLEXYTRAD, University of Malaga, Spain{hercos,gcorpas,iduran}@uma.esIsabel Dur?an Mu?nozAbstractWhen facing new fields, interpreters need to perform extensive searches for specialisedknowledge and terminology.
They require this information prior to an interpretation and haveit accessible during the interpreting service.
Fortunately, there are currently several terminologymanagement tools capable of assisting interpreters before and during an interpretation service.Although these tools appear to be quite similar, they provide different kind of features andas a result they exhibit different degrees of usefulness.
This paper aims at describing currentterminology management tools with a view to establishing a set of features to assess the extent towhich terminology tools meet the specific needs of the interpreters.
Subsequently, a comparativeanalysis is performed to evaluate these tools based on the list of features previously identified.1 IntroductionProfessional interpreters frequently face different settings and specialised fields in their interpretationservices and yet they always need to provide excellent results.
They might be called to work forspecialists that share a background knowledge that is totally or partially unknown to laypersons and/oroutsiders (Will, 2007).
When interpreters lack the necessary background knowledge or experience, theyusually need to perform extensive searches for specialised knowledge and terminology in a very efficientway in order to supply this deficit and acquire the required information.Even though there are several modes of interpretation, depending mainly on the timing/delay of theinterpretation, the direction and the setting (cf.
P?ochhacker, 2007), it is not possible for interpretersto collect the relevant specialised information during the interpretation service itself.
Interpreters arerequired to find the necessary information prior to interpretation and have it accessible during the service,even though they sometimes are able to carry out searches during the service.According to Rodr?
?guez and Schnell (2009), terminology work is present in the whole process ofpreparation prior to an interpretation service.
For example, interpreters become familiar with thesubject field by searching for specialised documents, by extracting terms and looking for synonymsand hyperonyms, by finding and developing acronyms and abbreviations and by compiling a glossary.According to these authors, interpreters tend to compile in-house glossaries tailor to their individualneeds as the main way to prepare the terminology of a given interpretation.2 Interpreters?
NeedsThe potentialities of computers for improving interpreters?
working conditions was realised a long timeago by Gile (1987).
However, very little progress has been made so far.
Costa, Corpas Pastor and Dur?an-Mu?noz (2014) offer a tentative catalogue of current language technologies for interpreters, divided intoterminology tools for interpreters, note-taking applications for consecutive interpreting, applications forvoice recording and training tools.
This paper focus exclusively on terminology tools for interpreterswith a view to performing a user evaluation.As a rule, most interpreters seem to be unaware of the opportunities offered by language technologies.As far as terminology is concerned, interpreters continue to store information and terminology on scraps?Hernani Costa is supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union?s FrameworkProgramme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA grant agreement No317471.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.68of paper or excel spreadsheets, while the use of technologies and terminology management tools isstill very low.
A study conducted by Moser-Mercer (1992:507, quoted in Bilgen, 2009) rejected theassumption that ?interpreters?
needs are identical to those of translators and terminologists?
and intendedto ?survey how conference interpreters handle terminology documentation and document control and tooffer some guidelines as to the interpretation-specific software tools for terminology and documentationmanagement?.
The results of this study includes some key findings, such as the conclusion that mostof the respondents were interested in exchanging terminological information and that they were opento using computers in their profession.
According to these findings, Moser-Mercer (1992) highlightedthat ?software developers targeting the conference interpreting market must provide a tool that meetsthe specific needs of the interpreters and not just market translation tools?
(ibid:511).
More recentstudies have also studied interpreters?
current needs and practices regarding terminology management(Rodr?
?guez and Schnell, 2009; Bilgen, 2009), and they also share the same findings: interpreters requirespecific tools to meet their needs, which are different from translators and terminologists.
According toa survey conducted by Bilgen (2009), 85% of respondents are open to using computers, yet conventionalmethods still prevail over the use of computerised methods of terminology management.
The authorobserved that respondents had no or little experience with terminology management software, and thosewith some experience were most dissatisfied with the money and time they had to invest in them, and theiroverall experience was mediocre (ibid:66).
Respondents indicated that their priorities were different fromthose identified in terminology literature in terms of terminological information stored, and the way inwhich term records are structured.
This is an important aspect that differentiates the needs of interpretersand translators as regards definitions and contexts (Bilgen, 2009).
Due to their working conditions,translators usually prefer to consult multiple definitions and contexts to find the best solution for thetranslation problem.
On the contrary, interpreters will rarely have the time to go over multiple definitions,contexts, etc.
to find the right one, and thus, they will need to store the most concise information to be ableto consult it in the quickest and easiest way.
Their responses in this survey also showed that the way theyretrieve terminological information was context-specific, and that there was also a significant variationamong individual interpreters.
Flexibility is, therefore, of great importance to interpreters due to thevariation of their context-specific terminology management practices, and on their individual preferencesregarding the storage, organisation and retrieval of terminological information (ibid:92).
Rodr?
?guez andSchnell (2009), after a thorough analysis of interpreters?
needs and in order to meet their requirementsas regards terminology management tools, propose the possibility of developing small databases thatvary according to the area of speciality or according to the conference and client.
These mini-databaseswould be multilingual and include an option allowing the interpreter to switch the source and targetlanguages.
This assumption is in line with the Function Theory (Bergenholtz and Tarp, 2003; Tarp,2008) and electronic multifunctional dictionaries (Spohr, 2009), which both defend the need to elaborateterminological entries according to the potential users.
Rodr?
?guez and Schnell (2009) recognise fivefeatures that would distinguish the interpreters?
mini-databases from the terminology databases intendedfor translators: speed of consultation; intuitive navigation; possibility of updating the terminology recordin the interpretation booth; considerable freedom to define the basic structure; and multiple ways offiltering data.Accordingly, they also suggest the abandonment of the usual terminology methodology if the intentionis to provide interpreters with specific glossaries tailored to their needs.
The authors advance the use ofa semasiological and associative methodology instead of the onomasiological approach, as ?it does notadapt well to interpretation because the cognitive effort required by the onomasiological structures slowsdown the interpretation process?
(ibid).3 Terminology Management Tools for InterpretersThere are some specialised computer and mobile software that can be used to quickly compile, store,manage and search within glossaries.
The most outstanding applications developed by/for interpretersare described in detail below.
They can be typically used to prepare an interpretation, in consecutiveinterpreting or in a booth.
These applications are quite similar to the look-up terminology tools currently69used by translators (Dur?an Mu?noz, 2012).
In fact, some of them have been developed to cater for theneeds of both translators and interpreters.
Due to the lack of space, this article is focused on standaloneapplications, but other types of applications like Web-based (e.g.
Interpreters?
Help1) can also be usedfor the same purposes (Ruetten, 2014).Intragloss2is a commercial Mac OS X software created specifically to help interpreters whenpreparing for an event by allowing them to manage glossaries.
This application can be simply definedas a glossary and document management tool created to help the interpreter prepare, use and mergedifferent glossaries with preparation documents, in more than 180 different languages.
It allows toimport and export glossaries from and to plain text, Microsoft Word and Excel formats.
Every glossaryimported to, or created in, is assigned to a domain glossary (considered the highest level of knowledge),which contains all the glossaries from the sub-areas of knowledge, named ?assignments?.
The creationof an assignment glossary can be done in two different ways: either by extracting automatically all theterms from the domain glossary that appear in the imported documents, or by highlighting a term in thedocument, search for it on search sites (such as online glossaries, terminology databases, dictionaries andgeneral Web pages) and manually add the new translated term to the assignment glossary.
It is importantto mention that the online search can be made within Intragloss.
Another interesting feature is thatIntraglosss permits to copy assignment glossaries and assignment entries from one assignment to another.The domain glossary may be multilingual as it can include several bilingual assignment glossaries.
Bya way of example, if we have two assignment glossaries English/French and Dutch/English, in the samedomain, the domain glossary will be French/English/Dutch, i.e.
multilingual.
Finally, Intragloss alsoallows to manually add meta-information to each glossary entry (see Fig.
1a).In short, Intragloss is an intuitive and easy-to-use tool that facilitates the interpreters?
terminologymanagement process by producing glossaries (imported or created ad hoc), by searching on severalwebsites simultaneously and by highlighting all the terms in the documents that appear in the domainglossary.
However, it is currently platform dependent and only works on Mac OS X platforms.InterpretBank3is a simple terminology and knowledge management software tool designed bothfor interpreters and translators using Windows and Android.
It helps to manage, learn and look upglossaries and term-related information.
Due to its modular architecture (see Fig.
1b), it can be usedto guide the interpreter during the entire workflow process, starting from the creation and managementof multilingual glossaries (TermMode), passing through the study of these glossaries (MemoryMode),and finally allowing the interpreter to look up terms while in a booth (ConferenceMode).
InterpretBankalso has an Android version called InterpretBank Lite.
This application is specifically designed to accessbi- or trilingual glossaries previously created with the desktop version.
It is useful when working as aconsecutive, community or liaison interpreter, when a quick look up at the terminology list is necessary.InterpretBank has a user-friendly, intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
It allows us to import and exportglossaries in different formats (Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, simple text files, Android and TMEX)and suggests translation candidates by taking advantage of online translation portal services, such asWikipedia, MyMemory and Bing.
However, it is platform-dependent (it only works on Windows andAndroid), does not handle documents, only glossaries and requires a commercial license.Interplex UE4is a user-friendly multilingual glossary management programme that can be used easilyand quickly in a booth while the interpreter is working.
Instead of keeping isolated word lists, it allowsto group all terms relating to a particular subject or field into multilingual glossaries that can be searchedin an instant.
As we can see in Fig.
1c, this programme permits to have several glossaries open at thesame time, which is a very useful feature if the working domain is covered by more than one glossary.Similar to the previous analysed programmes, Interplex UE also allows to import and export glossariesfrom and to Microsoft Word, Excel, and simple text files.
Interplex UE runs on Windows; nevertheless, ithas a simpler version for iOS devices, one named Interplex Lite, for iPhone and iPod Touch, and anothernamed Interplex HD, for iPad.
Both glossaries and multi-glossary searchers offer the functionality of1www.interpretershelp.com2intragloss.com3www.interpretbank.de4www.fourwillows.com70viewing expressions in each of the defined languages.In general, Interplex UE has a user-friendly interface and it is regularly updated.
It allows to importand export glossaries from and to Microsoft Word and Excel formats.
However, it, too, is platformdependent (only works on Windows and iOS), does not handle documents, only glossaries, and requiresa commercial license.

(d) SDL MultiTerm.
(e) AnyLexic.
(f) Lingo.Figure 1: Screenshots of various terminology managment tools.SDL MultiTerm Desktop5is a commercial terminology management tool developed for Windowsthat provides one solution to store and manage multilingual terminology.
MultiTerm was first launchedin 1990 by Trados GmbH but in 2005 the company was acquired by SDL6, which renamed MultiTerm toSDL MultiTerm.
Today, SDL MultiTerm is a terminology management tool commercialised by SDL asa standalone application, which has been improved according to the translators?
needs.
Alternatively,MultiTerm can be used within the SDL Trados Studio7as an integrated tool.
As translators can5www.sdl.com/products/sdl-multiterm/desktop.html6www.sdl.com7www.sdl.com/products/sdl-trados-studio71easily edit and add terminology within SDL Trados Studio, MultiTerm helps to improve the efficiencyof the translation process and promotes high-quality translated content with real-time verification ofmultilingual terminology.
This application is very complete because it allows to store an unlimitednumber of terms in a vast number of languages; imports and exports glossaries from and to differenttechnology environments, such as Microsoft Excel, XML, TBX and several other proprietary formats;permits to manually add a variety of meta-data information, such as synonyms, context, definitions,associated project, part-of-speech tags, URLs, etc.
Apart from the previous mentioned descriptive fields,MultiTerm also allows the user to insert illustrations to the terms in the terminology database (which canbe stored either locally or, for collaborative purposes, in a remote server).
It is important to mention thatthis visual reference feature is very useful specially to interpreters and translators dealing with unfamiliarterms.
Moreover, MultiTerm has an advanced search feature that permits to search not only the indexedterms but also in their descriptive fields, or create filters to make custom searches within specific fields,like language, definition, part-of-speech, etc.
Nevertheless, the most interesting feature about MultiTermis its concept-oriented feature, i.e.
each entry in MultiTerm corresponds to a single concept, which canbe described by different terms in both source and target language.
This detail is very important becauseit allows the user to centralise and customise the terms with more information, such as different possibletranslations and their corresponding contexts (see Fig.
1d).In general, MultiTerm can be seen as an advanced multilingual terminology tool with an intuitiveand easy-to-use interface.
Although MultiTerm was originally designed for translators, it can also beused by interpreters.
Its main advantage to interpreters, when compared with other terminology tools, istwofold: it allows to add several translation terms in one entry and permits to customise a wide varietyof descriptive fields, such as illustrations, associated projects, definitions, etc.
However, it can only beused on Windows, does not handle documents and there is no demo version available.AnyLexic8is an easy-to-use terminology management tool developed for Windows with a simpleand intuitive interface.
It was not designed to tie any particular terminological requirement, instead itaims to help the interpreter prepare, use and manage different glossaries or dictionaries.
AnyLexic canbe described as a robust terminology management tool, as it enables users to easily create and managemultiple mono-, bi- or multilingual glossaries in any language and to import and export glossaries fromand to Microsoft Excel, plain text and AnyLexic Exchange Format (AEF).
In addition, each entry in theglossary can have multiple translation equivalents in the target language along with notes.
The searchfor records in the database allow users to combine different options, such as search for all source termsor translation candidates and associated notes.
In addition, the search can be performed within one ormultiple glossaries (see Fig.
1e).
Another interesting feature in AnyLexic is the way that records can bedisplayed using different templates with configurable text colour, background colour, font size and textformat.
Besides, it is possible to create our own template for displaying the records.
With the purposeof simplifying the teamwork process, this tool has an additional option to exchange any glossary withother AnyLexic users by either using the AEF proprietary format or by accessing a remote glossary, avery useful feature when co-operating with other interpreters or translators on a project.In general, AnyLexic is an easy and convenient terminology database managing software for workingwith terminology, creating, editing and exchanging glossaries when working under one project bothalone or with other working partners.
However, it only works on Windows platforms and even though anevaluation version is available for 30 days, it requires a commercial license.Lingo9is a commercial Windows terminology management tool designed to create and manageterminology databases, whether mono- or multilingual.
It can import from and export to TMX and plaintext.
Its main features are: creation and management of any number of specialised glossaries/dictionariesin any language; can handle large files (i.e.
over 50K entries); it allows users to have several glossariesopen at the same time; and it has a rapid and easily configurable search functionality that can becustomised to search for all terms, translation candidates and associated descriptive fields, either in allglossaries or in a specific one.
Another interesting feature is the drag and drop functionality, which8www.anylexic.com9www.lexicool.com/soft_lingo2.asp72allows to easily insert words into Microsoft documents, for instance.As we can see in Fig.
1f, Lingo is a simple and user-friendly software that offers an effective wayto create and manage multilingual glossaries in any language.
Additionally, it permits to manually addan infinite number of customised fields into each entry, such as definitions, URLs, synonyms, antonyms,contextual information, notes or any other desirable field.
However, it is platform dependent and doesnot import from or export to common formats like Microsoft Word or Excel.UniLex10is a free terminology management tool created by Acolada GmbH for Windows.
It aimsto help interpreters and translators prepare, use and manage bilingual glossaries or dictionaries inapproximately 30 different languages.
UniLex offers a variety of search functions and the possibilityto combine user glossaries or dictionaries with a full range of dictionaries available in the UniLex series(e.g.
Blaha: Pocket Dictionary of Automobile Technology German/English), which can be acquiredas single user versions or as network versions for collaborative purposes.
UniLex can also be used ina network environment, which allows users to exchange glossaries or dictionaries.
Nevertheless, thisadditional feature requires a commercial license.In general, UniLex is not only capable of managing user bilingual glossaries or dictionaries, butalso dictionary titles from renowned publishers, which are sold by the company to be consulted withinUniLex.
However, it only works on Windows and does not handle multilingual glossaries.The Interpreter?s Wizard11is a free iPad application capable of managing bilingual glossaries in abooth.
It is a simple, fast and easy-to-use application that helps the interpreter to search and visualiseterminology in seconds.
The system includes rapid and easily configurable search functionality thatcan be customised to search for all terms, translation candidates either in all glossaries or in a specificone.
Nevertheless, all the imported glossaries need to be previously created and converted online to theproprietary format, and it does not allow users to export glossaries.3.1 Comparative AnalysisDespite the aforementioned terminology tools can be used to prepare a given interpretation accordingto the interpreters?
requirements identified in section 2, these systems differ from one another in theirfunctionalities, practical issues and degrees of user-friendliness.
Therefore, it is necessary to establisha set of specific and measurable features that permit us to assess and distinguish the different toolsconcerning users?
needs in such a way that the results would be useful for both potential users as wellas to the designers of such systems.
Departing from the conclusions drawn from the literature review(see section 2) and the description of the terminology tools analysed in section 3, we provide in thissection an analysis of these tools based on our own practical set of measurable features.
For instance, the?freedom to define the basic structure?
identified by Rodr?
?guez and Schnell (2009) was reformulated intoseveral practical measurable features, such as ?Noof descriptive fields?, ?Noof working languages?
and?Noof languages per glossary?.
Moreover, the possibility of ?developing multilingual mini-databases?,also identified in their study, was reconsidered as measurable features by means of the following criteria:?Manages multiple glossaries?
and ?Noof languages per glossary?.
Another example is the ?RemoteGlossary Exchange?
measurable feature, which was inferred from the study conducted by Bilgen (2009),who identified the need to exchange terminological information.After a careful analysis of the priorities for the design and features to be included in a terminologymanagement tool for interpreters, 15 features were identified, 5 of which were classified as fundamentalto a terminology tool (10 points) and 10 as secondary (5 points).
Then, these features were usedto evaluate the eight tools presented in section 3 and to investigate which one is the most complete.The first considered feature clarifies if the tools were designed to handle multiple glossaries in theirinterfaces at same time (Manages multiple glossaries).
The next two features are somehow related.
TheNoof possible working languages describes how many different working languages are permitted bythe application.
Then, considering these working languages, how many of them can be used at thesame time per glossary (Noof languages per glossary allowed).
The next feature is related with10www.acolada.de/unilex.htm11the-interpreters-wizard.topapp.net73Feature/EvaluationCriteriaIntraglossPre-1.0(2014)InterpretBank3.102(2014)Intraplex2.1.1.47(2012)SDLMultiTerm2014(2013)AnyLexic2.0.0.2110(2009)Lingo4(2011)UniLex0.9(2007)TheInterpreter?sWizard2.0(2011)Managesmultipleglossaries?no=0;yes=10?yes?10?yes?10?yes?10?yes?10?yes?10?yes?10?no?0?yes?10?Noofpossibleworkinglanguages??100=4;>100=7;unlimited=10??180?7??35?4?unlimited?10?unlimited?10?unlimited?10?unlimited?10??30?4?unlimited?10?Nooflanguagesperglossaryallowed??3=5;unlimited=10?2?5?2?5?unlimited?10?unlimited?10?unlimited?10?unlimited?10?2?5?2?5?Noofdescriptivefields?non=0;1=3;[2-5]=7;>5=10?4?7?4?7?non?0?>5?10?1?3?>5?10?2?7?non?0?Handlesdocuments?no=0;yes=10?yes(PDF,MSWord,PagesandKeynotefiles)?10?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?Unicodecompatibility?no=0;yes=5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?no?0?yes?5?Importsfrom?1=1;2=2;3=3;[4-5]=4;>5=5?MSWord,ExcelandPlainText?3?MSWord,Excel,TMEXandPlainText?4?MSWord,ExcelandPlainText?3?MSWord,ExcelandotherCATformats?5?MSExcel,PlainTextandAEF?3?TMXandPainText?2?PlainText?1?Proprietaryformat?1?Exportsto?non=0;1=1;2=2;3=3;[4-5]=4;>5=5?MSWordandExcel?2?MSWord,Excel,TMEX,AndroidandPlainText?4?MSWord,ExcelandPlainText?3?MSWord,ExcelandotherCATformats?5?MSExcel,PlainTextandAEF?3?TMXandPlainText?2?PlainText?1?non?0?Embeddedonlinesearchfortranslationcandidates?>no=0;yes=5?yes?5?yes?5?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?no?0?Interface?ssupportedlanguages?1=1;[2-5]=3;>5=5?English?1?English?1?English?1?English,German,French,Spanish,JapaneseandSimplifiedChinese?5?English,SimplifiedChinese,German,Spanish,French,Italian,Dutch,Polish,Portuguese,RussianandUkrainian?5?English?1?English,German,FrenchandSpanish?3?English?1?RemoteGlossaryExchange?no=0;yes=5?no?0?no?0?no?0?yes?5?yes?5?no?0?no?0?no?0?Well-documented?no=0;yes=5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?yes?5?no?0?no?0?Availability?proprietarywithoutdemo=1;proprietarywithdemo=3;free=5?proprietarywithdemo?3?proprietarywithdemo?3?proprietarywithdemo?3?proprietarywithoutdemo?1?proprietarywithdemo?3?proprietarywithdemo?3?free?5?free?5?OperatingSystem(s)?1=1;2=3;?3=5?MacOSX?1?WindowsandAndroid?3?WindownsandiOS?3?Windows?1?Windows?1?Windows?1?Windows?1?iOS(onlyiPad)?1?Otherrelevantfeatures?subjectiveanalysis=max.5?allowstohighlighttermsinthedocumentsandmergeaglossarywithadocumentmakingitannotatedtobeprinted?5?theMemoryModehelpstomemorisebilingualglossaries?4?permitstohaveseveralglossariesopenatthesametime?2?itisaconceptoriented-toolandpermitstoaddillustrationsintoeachentry?5?allowstoshareglossarieswithinagroupofAnyLexicusers?1?permitstoaddanunlimitednumberofdescriptivefields?2?

The possibility of managing terminology with preparation documents (Handles documents) isanother relevant feature for interpreters seeking for tools capable of highlighting terms in documents,for example.
Equally import is the Unicode support (Unicode compatibility) as it provides a uniquenumber for every character, no matter what the platform, the program, or the language is.
In otherwords, an application that supports full Unicode means that it has support for any ASCII or non-ASCIIlanguage, such as Hebrew or Russian, two non-ASCII languages.
Imports from and Exports to, as itsname suggests, represents the supported input and output formats.
The Embedded online search fortranslation candidates is a relevant add-in for terminology tools, as it permits to focus the search forterminological candidates within the tool.
Despite the fact that all the tools have English as a defaultlanguage, the support of multiple languages (Interface?s supported languages) is another importantfeature as it allows to increase the number of potential users that a terminology tool can reach.
TheRemote glossary exchange feature is important when co-operating with other working partners remotelyis required.
The next three features are related with the available documentation, their availability andplatform dependency (Well-documented, Availability and Operating System(s), respectively).
Finally,the last row presents some unique characteristics along with some relevant comments (Other relevantfeatures).Based on this comparative analysis, none of the investigated terminology tools exhibit all the proposedfeatures.
Nevertheless, SDL MultiTerm and Intragloss are the best classified with 77 and 69 points outof 100, respectively.
This is not surprising because SDL MultiTerm is the most expensive tool nowadaysavailable on the market and, apart from that, it has been developed for more than 20 years.
Its flexibilityto easily store, manage and search for multilingual terminology and definitions is just an example ofthe features that meet the specific needs of an interpreter.
The score of Intragloss, released last yearas a beta version, is neither surprising due to its novelty and design purposes, i.e.
it was developed byinterpreters for interpreters and thus corresponds better to their needs.
On the other hand, UniLex and TheInterpreter?s Wizard tools got the worst scores due to the lack of features offered.
About the remainingtools (AnyLexic, Lingo, InterpretBank and Intraplex) we can say that they have similar features, whichresulted in similar scores (64, 61, 60 and 55, respectively).4 ConclusionThis paper presents an overview of the most relevant features that terminology management tools shouldhave in order to help interpreters before and during the interpretation process.
Eight terminology toolsare discussed and a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate them on the bases of the set of featurespreviously identified.
This comparative analysis not only aims at highlighting some of the features thatinterpreters can expect from the currently available terminology management tools on the market, butalso intended to help them choose a specific tool for a given interpretation project.
Table 1 providesinterpreters with a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the currently available terminology toolson the market.
It is envisaged to serve as a concise guide to help interpreters choose the terminologymanagement tool that best caters for their specific needs, in order to help them work more efficiently,store and share terminology more easily, as well as save time when a looking for a specific feature mostsuited to a specific interpreting service.Although most of the analysed tools could be considered to be very flexible when searching forterminology within glossaries, it appears that none of them fulfil all needs of interpreters.
It is worthmentioning that some tools require a steep learning curve while others imply a significant financialinvestment (e.g.
Lingo and SDL MultiTerm, respectively).
Moreover, some tools are fairly basic andmore orientated towards creating and managing bilingual or multilingual glossaries rather than morecomprehensive terminology records with supporting information (e.g.
UniLex and The Interpreter?sWizard).Given that quality terminology management ranks high in their priorities, it would seem that there isa pressing need to design terminology management tools tailored to assist interpreters in the preparationstage, before their interpreting service or during it.
In this respect, it would be necessary to identify theexact needs of interpreters (which are likely to be different from translators).75AcknowledgementsThe research reported in this article has been partially carried out in the framework of the EducationalInnovation Project TRADICOR (PIE 13-054, 2014-2015); the R&D project INTELITERM (noFFI2012-38881, 2012-2015), and the R&D Project for Excelence TERMITUR (ref.
