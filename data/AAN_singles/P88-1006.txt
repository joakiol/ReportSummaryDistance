A General Computational Treatment of Comparativesfor Natural Language Question AnsweringBruce W. BallardAT&T Bell Laborotories600 Mountain AvenueMurray Hill, N.J. 07974AbstractWe discuss the techniques we have developed andimplemented for the cross-categorial treatment ofcomparatives in TELl, a natural anguage question-answering system that's transportable among bothapplication domains and types of backend retrievalsystems.
For purposes of illustration, we shallconsider the example sentences "List the cars at least20 inches more than twice as long as the Century iswide" and "Have any US companies made at least 3more large cars than Buick?"
Issues to be consideredinclude comparative inflections, left recursion andother forms of nesting, extraposition of comparativecomplements, ellipsis, the wh element "how', and thetranslation of normalized parse trees into logicalform.1.
IntroductionWe shall describe a general treatment ofcomparatives that has been implemented in thecontext of TELI, a question-answering system whichis transportable among both domains of discourse anddifferent types of backend retrieval systems.nComparatives are important because of the dramaticincrease in expressive power they allow; they areinteresting at least because of the variety of issues(from morphology on up) one must deal with inorder to provide for them.1.
The examples in this paper illustrate TEL1 us a front-end tothe Kandor knowledge representation system (Patel-Schneider,1984); we will give examples in terms of a knowledge base ofinformation about 1987 cars.
TELI has produced queries forat least four different "backend" systems and has been adaptedfor over a dozen domains of data.411.1 GoalsIn seeking to provide TEL1 with general capabilitiesfor comparatives, our primary goals have beento formulate cross-categorial techniques that treatthe comparativizations of different syntactic elements(e.g.
adjectives, quantifiers, and measure nouns) withthe same mechanisms;to allow comparatives to be composed withthemselves (e.g.
"at least 3 more than 3 times asmany') and with other syntactic features (e.g.
whelements);to be faithful to what is known from work intheoretical linguistics; we draw from Bresnan (1973),Cushing (1982), Dik (1980), Jackendoff (1977),Sells (1985), and Winograd (1983);to account for as many of the specific cases ofcomparatives found in the literatureof implementedNL processors as possible.1.2 AchievementsLetting <X> denote a grammatical category to becomparativized, we begin by providing forcomparativized structures C{<X>} of the formC{<X>} -.
* (<Qmd>) CC{<X>) <Comp><Qua> -'* *tmostlatleutlaolexsctlylg~'dmyljastlealyCC{<X>} -=*" (CC{<X>}) (<Measure>)  <e l> (<X>)  <c2><Measure> --*  <Number> (<Ordinai>lperc~t l t inNs)  I<onus> --* h~lt~ltUrdsl - -<Comp> --0 <NP> <Etcx><el>/<c2> .-4, -er / f lum\[ less / thu\ [ss /uswhere (...) denotes optionality; "/" indicates"agreement" between comparative particles; and<Etcx> accounts for items parallel to those in thematrix clause in which the comparative occurs (e.g.
"cars that are longer than the Regal (is (wide))').
Inaddition, a variety of extrapositions (i.e.
rightwardand occasional leftward movement) from C{<X>}may (and sometimes must) occur.
For example, both"cars larger than the Century" and "larger cars thanthe Century" are allowed.Since we wish to allow C{<X>} structuresto occur wherever <X> could occur, arbitrarilycomplex interactions with quantifiers (within thecomplement), ordinals, superlatives, raisings, whelements, and other constructs must be provided for.In addition to the structures indicated by the BNFabove, we allow for some simpler expressions notconventionally classified as comparatives.
Someexamples are "6 ears" (cf.
"as many as 6 cars') and"3 inches long" (cf.
"as long as 3 inches').
We alsoprovide for structures involving the nominalcounterpart of an adjective, as in "more than 185inches in length'.To date, we have fully implemented a widevariety of comparatives related to adjectives,quantifiers, and measure nouns (e.g.
"cars that costat least $100 more than the Park Avenue').
Due tothe commonality among the comparativized syntacticstructures, our grammar for these three types ofcomparatives is produced by meta-rules suggested bythe BNF rules shown above.
Although the featureagreement provided by our parser is used to eliminatespurious structures such as "cars more than 3(inches/*dollars) long', we avoid conflicts betweenpure numbers and measure phrases that involve aunit (e.g.
"companies that make more than 3(*dollars) cars') by having two (very nearlyidentical) Quantity routines in the grammar.1.3 Lhnitatioas"In addition to some specific limitations to be stated inthe remainder of the paper, there are some generallimitations of our work to date, many of which arebeing rectified by the work mentioned in Section 8.3.
(1) By analogy with conjunctions, with whichcomparatives share a number of properties (cf.
Sager1981, pp.
196ff), our comparative particle pairs (-er/than etc.)
provide for co-ordinate comparatives, incontrast o pairs such as so/that, as in "Buick makesso many cars that it's the largest company."
(2)Comparative complements are expected in a limitednumber of places.
For example, "Audi makes morelarge cars than Pontiac in France" is recognized but"Audi makes more large cars in France than Pontiac"is not.
This is because we currently propagate theevidence of having found a comparative panicle("more") to the noun phrase headed by "cars', hencethe complement ('than ...') can attach there, but notto the higher level verb phrase headed by "makes'.This limitation also prevents our processing "Whatcompanies make a larger car than Buick', whoseexact meaning(s) the reader is invited to ponder.
(3)Since comparative complements are based on nounphrases, neither "Audi makes more large cars inFrance than in Germany" nor "Audi makes largeears more in France than in Germany" is recognized.
(4) We attempt no pragmatic disambiguation ofsemantically ambiguous comparatives.
Thus, whenconfronted with "more than 3 inches shorter" or"more than 3 fewer cars', we provide thecompositional interpretation associated with our leftrecursive syntax.
Even expressions such as "as many"and "as large" are ambiguous between at least andexactly.
(5) We attempt no anaphora processing,and so comparatives without a complement, as in"Which cars are larger?
', are not processed.
(6) Weprovide general conversion of units of measure (e.g.
"2 feet longer" is the same as "24 inches longer') butthey are not fully incorporated into the system.2.
Aa Initial ExmnpleThe mechanisms we shall describe apply aconventional series of transformations to sentencescontaining one or more comparatives, ultimatelyresulting in an executable expression.
As an exampleof this process, 2 we'll consider the input"List the cars at lee.st 20 inches more tlum twiceas long as the Century is wide"which contains a highly comparativized adjective.First, this input is scanned and parsed, yielding theparse tree shown in Figure 1.
Note that eachCOMPAR node has a QUANTITY node and aMODE 3 of its own.
Also, the MODE of the topCOMPAR (whose value is "equal') is co-indexed(indicated by the subsrcipt i) with the MODEfeature associate with the panicle ('as') thatintervenes between the ADJ and its COMPAR-ARG; this assures that -er/than, less/than, and as/aspairs collocate correctly.
Next, we build a"normalized" parse tree by reconstructing elementsthat were discontinuous in the surface structure and2.
A formal account he associated formalisms, including a BNFsyntax and a denotational semantics for our "normalized parsetrees" and "algebraic-logical form" language, is given in Ballardand Stumberger (1987).3.
Dashed lines indicate features, as distinct from lcxical items,and empty nodes, which result from Whiz-deletion, are denotedby '? '
.42by performing other simplifications.
This yields thefollowing structure, whose 2-place predicate, with P(parameter) and A (argument) as variables,corresponds to "at least 20 inches more than twice as?
.. as ' .Normalized Purse Tree:(CAR (NOUN CAR)(COMPAR (ADJ LONG)(A (P A) (~  P (?
20 ( .
2 A ) ) ) )(CAR { = CENTURY)  )(ADJ WIDE) ) )Next, user-defined meanings of words and phrasesare looked up 4 and the comparati~zafion perationsdescribed in Section 6 are performed, yieldingAlgebraic-Logical Fon~(SET (CAR Pl)( ~ (Length-of -Car  P I  )(+ 20 (~ 2 (Width-of -Car  CENTURY\]Finally, this representation is converted into theexecutable expression i dicated bylrmal Executable Exprossiee:(SUBSET (X (Pl)(~  (KSV PI eS{LENGTH})(?
20(- 2 (KSV @I(CENTURY}BS{WIDTH} ) ) ) )(KI @F{CAR} ) ) )where KSV and KI are primitive retrieval functionsof the Kandor back-end; @I{...}, @F{...} and @S{...}are Lisp objects respectively denoting instances,frames, and slots in Kandor's taxonomic knowledgebase; and >I>/ is a coercion routine supplied byTELI to accommodate backend retrieval system thatproduce numbers in disguise (e.g.
a Lisp object or asingleton set) on which the standard Lisp functionswould choke.
5However, since compositionally createdstructures such as the preceding one are oftenintolerably inefficient, optimiz~tions are carried outwhile the executable xpression is being formed.
Inthe case at hand, the second argument of >I >~ isconstant, so it is evaluated, producingOptimized Executable Exlmressiee:(SUBSET (A (Pl)(~>/ (KSV P1 @S{LENGTH}) 158))(KI BF{CAR} ) )A second example, which illustrates a comparative4.
In TELI, meanings may be arbitrary expressions in theextended tint-order language discussed in Ballard andStumberger (1987).5.
Similar functions are also supplied for arithmetic operators.quantifier, is given in an appendix where, as a resultof optimizations analogous to those which producedthe constant 158 above, the comparative "at least 3more large cars than Buick" is eventually processedexactly as though it had been "at least 6 cars" (sinceBuick made 3 large cars).3.
Lexical Provisions for ComparativesOur current repertoire of domain-independent lexicalitems associated with comparatives includes "many',"few', and "much'; "more', with 3 readings (er,er+many, er+much), following Bresnan (1972) andsimilar to Robinson (1982, p. 28); "fewer (er+few);"less', with 3 readings (less, er+few 6, less+much);several formatives and adverbials ('at', "least',"most', "exactlY', "precisely', "only', "just', "half',"again', "times', "percent'); and a handful of spelled-out ordinals ('thirds" etc.).
Though not stored in thelexicon, both integers and floating-point umbers (of.
"3.45 inches') are also involved in comparativization.The domain-dependent portion of the lexiconincludes members of the open categories ofadjectives, measure nouns, and comparativeinflections of adjectives.
The scanner output for thecomparative of the adjective A is er +A (e.g.
"larger"becomes er+large).4.
Syntax for ComparativesThe basic syntax for comparatives adheres to themeta-rules given in Section 1.2.
As indicated in theparse tree of Figure 1, COMPAR is never a primarytree node but is instead a daughter of the node beingcomparativized.
Furthermore, since our grammarhas recently taken on somewhat of an X-bar flavor(cf.
Jackendoff, 1977), the complement for acomparativized item is found as either its sister or itsparent's sister.
Complex comparatives derive fromleft-recursive structures.
7 Our present grammar forcomparatives i set up partly by meta-rules 8 andpartly by hand-coded rules relating to suchidiosyncracies as "more than 3 inches in length"(however, of.
"more than 6 in number*).6.
To the possible horror of the prescriptive grammarian, thisaccounts for such attrecities as "less books'.7.
Though our parser operates top-down, we've incorporated ageneral mechanism for left recursinn that's also utilized bypossessives (e.g.
"the newest car's company's largestcompatitor's smallest car').8.
Meta-rules are also used to produce the grammar for relativeclauses, yes-no questions, and a host of other structures (e.g.various lash categories) from a hand-coded grammar for basicdeclarative sentences.43S.
Parse Tree Normalization 'Letting Node{<X>} denote a node of thenormalized parse tree associated with an element oftype <X>,  comparatives involve the replacementdenoted byNodelCt<X>}}--.
* (COMPAR Node{<X>} <Rel> <At\]g> <Etcx>)where <Arg> corresponds to an optional nounphrase, <Etcx> captures non-elided materialassociated with the matrix clause, and the 2-place-relation denoted by <Re l> is the most interesting(and by far the most complex) element produced.The algorithm that produces it converts "more',"less", and "times" respectively into +, - ,  and *.
Thisprocess is left recursive; the relational operator isdetermined from the highest MODE, and by defaultit is assigned to be _.9 As indicated below, thesealgebraic and arithmetic symbols will be preserved inthe executable expression unless the word beingcomparativized indicates a downward irection on thescale applicable to it (e.g.
"fewer', "shorter'), inwhich case they will be reversed (e.g.
>i becomesand -~ becomes - ) .
Each 2-place-relation is the bodyof a 2-place lambda whose variables, P and A, areassociated with values obtained from a parameterand an argument against which a comparison isbeing made.
Some example 2-place-predicates aremere than 166 h~les leagmore than IS feet lingat meat 180 inchu king~ e mat least u leq as1 h~.h ~ger t t~exactly twice as Iomlg as3 times as long ashalf agala  leq asforty percem kqer t~mless thu erie third u leq asat least 3 inches mere almatwice u leeg u(> P 166)(> P 180)(~ P 18o)(> PA)(~ PA)( -  P (.

3 A))(~ P (* 1.5 A))(~  P (.
(+  ( /40 I00) I) A))(< P (.
(I 1 3) A))( )  P (+  3 (- 2 A)))When the measure noun appearing in an Englishinput differs from that by which the objects beingtested are measured, as indicated by the secondexample above, a scalar conversion is required.6.
Semant ics  for ComparativesThe semantics of comparativization involvesconverting a one-place predicate into another one-place predicate by performing arbitrarily complexoperations on it.
For example, if "large car" has beendefined as a car whose length exceeds 190 inches,thetl, letting "A" denote a noun phrase complement,some examples aret0qkMq~r tim 180 hm:l~leqcr tlam Ano lealger than Atwice as leog as A t- wide3 laches mora thaatwi~ as long as ALesgth(x) ;~ 190Lcegth(x) > 18oLeq~(x) > Leq~(A)Le,t.m(x) ~ Le~mCA)Leqpm(x) ~ 2 ?
Wldth(A)Length(x) > 3 + 2 ,  Length(A)where each of these right-hand-sides is the body of aone-place predicate whose single variable is x.As a second example, comparative quantifierssuch as "more than 6" are handled by an identicalprocess l?, as indicated by Iix has --any y,.
Size {y I Jhs(x,y)} ;~x has more tham 6 y's Size {y \[ Has(x,y)\] > 6x Im mere y'.
em A Size {y Int, s(x,y)} > Size blt~(A,y)}x Im at lem 2 me~ Size {y \[ Hgix,y)}y's tim A ~ 2 + Size \[y \] l-I~(A.y)}where the initial Constant denotes some arbitraryconstant.In general, comparativizing a one-placepredicate takes place as follows.1.
Find (a) an appropriate one-place function and(b) an associated relational operator that tellswhich direction on a linear scale indicateshaving "more" of the property.2.
Apply the relational operator located above tothe modality of the comparison to determinethe relational operator that will appear in theIR+.
I f  the relational operator of the definitionbeing comparativized is either > or >i, use themode occurring in the IR; otherwise, "reverse"the mode by doing what would be a negationbut leaving untouched the - portion of theoperator.
Thus, the reversal of < is > ,  the9.
This addresses the inherent ambiguity of as/as structureswithout an adverbial element, such as "exactly" or "at least'.Thus, "people with 3 children" is interpreted as people withexactly 3children.10.
That is, we have no special purpose processing for "more than',"how many" etc.11.
We use "has" in these xamples for clarity; naturally, the scopeof a comparative quantifier may contain an arbitrarily complexpredicate.44reversal of ~< is />, and so forth.
Similarly, +,and - are switched.3.
Determine the argument being comparedagainst (possibly a constant).4.
Link these pieces together.
If the argumentwas not constant (e.g.
"... longer than at least 3foreign cars'), wrap its scope around theresulting expression.For example, if "short car" has been defined as"x is short': Length(x) < 160then the 1-place function and relational operator aredetermined in step 1 to be Length and <~, and thuswe have"shorter than A" -"* Leagth(x) < IAalgtk(A)"exactly 3 inches horter than A"--* LentO(x) - Izs~(A) - 37.
Comparatives Containing a Wh ElementIn addition to recognizing wh elements associatedwith a relative or interrogative clause, 12 TELIrecognizes the word how when it appears in place ofa quantity, e.g.
"how long" (cf.
"6 inches long') and"how many more" (of.
"6 more't3).
Wherever whappears, however, we treat its semantics as roughly"solve for wh such that'.
In the case of interrogativepronouns (e.g.
"what'), this leads rather obviously toan internal representation asking for a SET.
In thecase of "how', this treatment is also in order since itrepresents a (quantity) NP.
For simplicity, weproduce an expression containing an unbound wh andlater give it wide scope.
14 In particular, subsequentprocessing involves moving the wh element upward inthe logical form tree 18 by performing appropriatetransformations.12.
To see that wh is less than a "word', consider pairs such aswhat~that, where~there and when~then.
The advantage ofrecognizing sub-word units us the primitives on which syntaxand/or semantic analysis is based should come as no surprise toanyone acquainted with the structure of languages other thanEnglish, which is unusual in coming so close to being treatablesolely at the word level.13.
As stated earlier, we have adopted derivations uggested byBresnan (1973) such as -er+many---qnore.
In the case athand, we must assume something like Q+many--*Q, where Qdenotes a quantity.14.
The scope is wide but not global because of inputs such as"How many cars does each US company make?"15.
Of course, our algebraic-logical forms, based on operators andtheir associated arguments, amount o being trees.For illustration, consider the absurdlycomplicated example"Buick makes 3 more than how many percentmore cars than Audi?
"the comparative portion of whose internalrepresentation t6 is(X (P A) ( -  P (+ ( *  A (+ 1 ( /  WN 100) ) )  3 \ ]At this point, we proceed with semantic processing,ignoring for the moment he presence of the unboundWH element.
In the case at hand, this leads to(= (COUNT (SET (CAR P l )  (Make BUICK P l )  ) )(?
(, (COUNT (SET (CAR Pl)(Make AUDI PI) ))(+ I(/ wH 100)))3))after which we "solve for" WH to yield(.
(- (/ (- (COUNT (SET (CAR PI)(Make BUICK PI)))3)(COUNT (SET (CAR PI)(Make AUDI PI)) ))I)100)This process is not dependent on the position inwhich the wh occurred, and thus takes the place ofs l~: ia l -pu~ interpretation routines for "howmany,, "How <Adjective>',  and so forth.
178.
DiscussienThus far, we have presented an overview of ourtreatment of comparatives, with as much detail aswe're able to supply in a conference-length paper.Although we can offer no substantive mpiricalevidence with TELI (e.g.
results of use by non-authors), we believe some of the techniques we'vepresented can be put to use by the reader.
Furtherinformation, especially with regard to the interactionof comparatives with a variety of other types ofconstructs, can be found in Bailard and Stumberger(1987).16.
The sentence is ambiguous, with readings indicated by "3 morethan \[how many percent\]" and "\[3 more than how manylpercent'.
As indicated earlier, we presently take the readingthat favors the use of left reenrsion.17.
Problematic situations can arise in which simple algebraicoperations aren't sufl~cienct.
For example, in examples such as"Cars were sold to people with how many children?
', we mustmove wh past a logical quantifier, rather than the arithmeticoperators as shown above.458.1 Related WorkAlthough the literature describing implemented NLprocessors contains many examples of comparativeconstructions (cf.
Kirsch (1964) for a wealth of earlyexamples), at least two qualifications may be givenconcerning the current "state of the art" ofcomparative treatment.
First, the majority of theexamples appearing in the literature are quitesimple 18 (e.g.
"more than $250") and can be preparedfor by specifying a 2-place predicate in advancethat's effectively equivalent o the 2-place predicatewe construct from an underlying 1-place predicate byway of coercion into a 1-place function.
This allowsone to avoid some slippery problems of movement(which we have adressed but have certainly notdisposed of), to ignore morphological subtleties (e.g.recognizing the "er" o f  "larger" or "more" as -er, a"word" to be input to the parser), and to take othershortcuts.
19 Second, although examples of varioustypes of comparatives are not hard to come by,accounts of the actual mechatdsms that treatcomparatives are harder to find, as are specificstatements of the generality which authors believethemselves to have provided for.8.2 Levels of RepresentationThe architecture of TEL I  resembles that of similarlymotivated question answering systems (cf.
Grosz etal, 1987; Hafncr and Godden, 1985; Bates andBobrow, 1983 and Bates et al1985) by comprising alinear sequence of processing stages which producesuccessively -lower" level representations of theinput.
2?
Although our parse tree format is ratherconventional, 21 what we have called "normalized18.
Evidence of the gap between what's been studied and whatmay actually be important is expressed, in the context ofpronoun resolution, in Hobbs (1978, p. 343) as follows: "Thereare classes of examples from the literature which are not ...handled by the algorithm, but they occur arely in actual texts,and in view of the fact that the algorithm fails on much morenatural and common examples, there seems to be little point ingreatly complicating the algorithm to handle them."19.
The extent o which "shortcuts" are justified, from either apsychological or system designer's standpoint, is not clear.
Asa possibly bizarre xample, consider the word "after', whichcould be treated as "-er .aft than', where .aft is the Anglo-Saxon root (extant only on I:card ship) from which currentEnglish word derives.
A perhaps even more bizarreopportunity may exist for treating "rather" as "-er .rathe',where ".rathe" is a Middle English adverb meaning "quickly'.20.
We're using "low" to refer to level of abstraction.
Perhapsironically, successively higher levels of cognitive informationare involved in producing these "lower" level representation.21.
The methods whereby TELI produces parse trees are lessconventional than the trees it produces, due to our provision forhaving the parser enforce agreements automatically while it isrunning, rather than doing subsequent fil ering.parse tree" and "algebraic-logical form" correspondrather loosely to what in the literature are oftencalled "logical form" and "meaning representation',respectively.
Furthermore, in the most recent workwith TELI,  meaningful distinctions between moduleshave become blurred, although the relative order inwhich operations are carried out is largely the same.In seeking to compare our formalisms andprocessing strategies with others that have beenproposed, we have found terms such as "logical form"being used in the literature in quite vague and oftenincompatible ways.
Furthermore, we know of nocompelling arguments that suggest that apsychologically plausible model of humaninformation processing will require intermediatelevels such as parse trees, logical forms, and the like.Is it even clear that there ought be be a finitenumber of successive "levels", whatever they mightbe?
We are increasingly doubtful that the trappingsspawned by linguists and philosophers can be put in abag, sprinkled with Common Lisp, shaken, andexpected to yield robust natural language processors.More of an interdisciplinary effort may be requiredthan has yet been seen.8.3 Curreat WorkThe representation given in Section 5 fundamentallyrestricts us from handling comparatives whosecomplement is more than one level above the wordbeing comparativized (e.g.
"John persuaded hisstudents to contribute to more museums than Billdid').
Our current work involves producingnormalized parse tree structures of roughly the form(COMPAR.2 Ci <Co..p>('COMP~-I Ct-)  -.
)where the COMPAR-1 and <Comp> structurescorrespond to the COMPAR structure given inSection 5; Ct provides for co-indexing when multiplecomparativizations are present; and the first "..."allows for arbitrarily many levels.
This calls upon usto modify the semantic processing presented inSection 6, making it resemble the treatment given towh elements as described in Section 7.469.
ConclusionsWe have presented algorithms aimed at themorphological, syntactic, and semantic problemsassociated with a large variety of comparativestructures that arise in the context of questionanswering.
We believe the extent of our coverageequals in several ways and exceeds in some ways thecapabilities known to us via the literature.
However,comparatives operate as a "meta" phenomenon andthus cut across many issues; we have ignored certainproblems and knowingly treated others inadequately.Further work is certainly required, and we hope tohave presented a framework in which (I) someinteresting and important capabilities can be providedfor now and (2) further computational studies can becarried out.10.
