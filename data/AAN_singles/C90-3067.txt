A PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAMMAR OF  THE ARABIC  LANGUAGEAYMAN ELNAGGAR iABSTRACTA lot of work has been donein the field of natural languageprocessing (NLP) for ARABIC.
Fewresearchers have tried hard to applyon ARABIC the methods ofcomputational linguistics, as forexample, Definite Clause Grammar(DCG) \[I\] and Augmented Transit ionNetworks (ATN) \[2\].
Because there isnot a modern linguistic model forARABIC grammar within the frame ofcomputational linguistics, theresults achieved are not comparablewith that achieved on ENGLISH.In this paper, we represent thephrase structures covering ARABIC.They are completely different fromENGLISH.i.
INTRODUCTIONSince ARABIC is a rich andhighly inflected language \[3\], thereare grannnatical categories inARABIC which do not exist in otherforeign languages such as in ENGLISH\[4\].
For example, there is an ARABICcategory 2 called 'I/AFOOL MOTLAK'which has no equivalent in ENGLISH.Moreover, there are syntacticcategories in ARABIC which couldthemselves be a whole sentence oreven a psepositional phrase Anexample of such a category is theadverb .
In addition, there are otherdifferences in the order of theconstituents within the sentence.
Forexample, in ARABIC, adjectives followthe noun which they modify.In fact, ARABIC has its ownstructure, which is completelyi 21 KASER EL-EINI St. CAIRO, EGYPT.2 When there is no equivalenttranslation available for anycategory in ENGLISH, thetransliterated form will be shownbetween single quotes.different from ENGLISH and hence,requires a different treatment.2.ARABIC AND COMPUTATIONALLINGUISTICSAs the need increases to amodel of A~%BIC, ARABIC linguists tryto re-organize the granmlatic systemin a way that may help theresearchers in the field ofcomputational linguistics.
Linguistsis tradit ional ly concerned withformal, general, structural models ofnatural language.
Linguists,therefore, have tended to buildformal models which allow to capture,as much as possible, theregularities of language and make themost appropriate linguisticgeneralizations.
Little or noattention has been paid tocharacterize the language itself,ignoring the mechanism that produceit or decipher it.So, the researchers spent mostof the time in re-building the modelsgiven by the linguists.
Their aim wasto make these models acceptable incomputational field (synthesis,generation and translation).2.i THE KEYWhat is new in this work isthat we classif ied all the nounphrase modif iers into two categories.Category one, noun phrase post-modifiers, in which the orderedsequence of these modif iers issignificant and it is the key toconstruct these noun phrasestructures These modif iers are nouncomplement (NC), adjective (ADJ),apposit ion (APP) and correlation(COR).
Category two which consistsmainly from VP modif iers like adverb.The above categorization hasgiven us the abil ity to focus on eachcategory and finally the NPstructures were obtained .342  13.
THE NOUN PHRASE STRUCTURESWe have Eight structurescovering all the categories of nounphrases.
FIVE of these structures aregiw~n here.The notation used indescribing these structures is :-( ) = The category inside thesebrackets is optional.
*( ) = The category inside thesebrackets could be repeated more thanonce .\[ \] = The category inside thesebrackets exists once at least?
*\[ \] = The category inside thesebrackets could be repeated but itshould exists once at least?Representation is inChomsky's Normal Form and should beinterpreted from right to leftThe structures given hereconsist mainly of NOUN (N) as thebasic unit and its maximum allowablepost-modifier8 wh ichcou ld  follow itThese post-modif iers have aspecific sequence which is the key toconstruct these structures andaccording to the number of thesepost-modifiers, the structures varyThe NP structures as well  as some ofthe ARABIC categories theyconstitute, are given in Fig.

MODIFICATION'MAFOOL MOTLAK' is a specialmodif ier in Arabic which has adifferent forms depending on itspost-modifiers.
We have first \[5\]considered its structure as:*(ADJ) (NC) NOUNBut later on, we have found out thatboth NC and ADJ can not existsimultaneously and only one of themshould exist alone.
So, we have splitthis structure to three structuresNP3, NP4 anti NP5 pub l i shed  here .ACKNOWLEDGMENTI would like to thank Dr. T.AMBER (~.)
for her valuable discussionand support Also~, I would like tothank Dr. H~ MAHGOUB ~)  for hiscomments reviewing the paper and who,first, implemented most of thestructures given here?CONCLUS IONWe have tried here to presentthe paper in a frame work showingthat the study of computationalmodel ing of ARABIC faces manyproblems.
It is evident that:, theARABIC possesses a certain symmetryas regards its structure, which leadsitself easily to computation.
