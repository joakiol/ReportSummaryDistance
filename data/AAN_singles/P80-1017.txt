Interactive Discourse: Influence of the Social ContextPanel Chair's IntroductionJerry R. HobbsSRI InternationalProgress on natural language interfaces can perhaps bestimulated or directed by imagining the ideal naturallanguage system of the future.
What features (or evendesign philosophies) should such a system have in orderto become an integral part of our work environments?What scaled-down versions of these features might bepossible in the near future in "simple service systems"\[2\]?
These issues can be broken down into the followingfour questions:i.
What are the significant features of the environmentin which the system will reside?
The system will be oneparticipant in an intricate information network, depend-ing on a continually reinforced shared complex of knowl-edge \[9\].
To be an integral part of this environment,the system must possess some of the shared knowledge andperhaps must participate in its reinforcement, e.g.
viaexplanations, \[9\], \[2\].2.
Investigations of person-person communication sho111dtell us what person-system communication ought to belike.
Face-to-face conversation is extraordinarily richin the information that is conveyed by various means,such as gesture, body position, gaze direction \[4\], \[8\].In addition to conveying propositional content or infor-mstion, what are the principal functions that moves inconversation perform?a.
Organization of the interaction, regulation of turns\[7\], \[i\].
In the natural language dialog systems oftoday, each turn consists of a sentence or less.
In ex-periments done at SRI on instruction dialogs betweenpeople over computer terminals, the instructor's turnsusually involve long texts.
It was discovered that thestudent needs a way of interrupting.
That is, some sortof turn-taking mechanisms are required, what can welearn from the turn-taking mechanisms people use?b.
Orientation of the participants toward each other,including recognition \[6\], expressions of solidarity andindications of agreement and disagreement \[3\], meta-comments on the direction of the conversation \[8\] or thereasons for certain utterances (\[9\] on discourse expla-nations).c.
Maintenance of the channel of cO~unicat ion,  implic-it acknowledgment or verification of information con-veyed \[2\].
Recovery from mistakes and breakdowns incommtunication \[8\], e.g.
via flexibility in parsing andinterpretation \[2\]; via explicit indications of in-comprehension \[2\] and repairs \[5\].
In natural languagesystems of today, when the user makes a mistake and thesystem fails to interpret the input, the user must usu-ally begin over again.
The system cannot use whateverit did get from the mistake to aid in the interpretationof the repair.
People are more efficient, what are theprincipal means of repair that people use, and how canthey be carried over to natural language systems?taining one's role, e.g.
as a competent, cooperativeparticipant (cf.
\[8\]; \[9\]; \[i\] for the role of speechstyle; \[4\] for defense of competence).
In addition tothe system having a model of the user, the user willhave a model of the system, determined by the nature ofhis interaction with it.
The system should thus betailored to convey an accurate image of what the systemcan do.
For example, superficial politeness or fluency("Good morning, Jerry.
What can I do for you today?
")is more likely to mislead the user about the system'scapabilities than to ease the interaction.
What thesystem does, via lexical choice, indirect speech acts,polite forms, etc., to maintain its role in the inter-action should arise out of a coherent view of what therole is.
The linguistic competence of the system is animportant element of the image it conveys to the user\[2\].3.
When we move from face-to-face conversations todialogs over computer terminals, the communication ispurely verbal.
The work done non-verbally now has to berealized verbally.
How are the realizations of theabove functions altered over the change of channels\[6\]?
We know, for example, that there are more utter-ances showing solidarity and asking for opinions,because this is work done non-verbally face-to-face \[3\].Some things that occur face-to-face (e.g.
tensionrelease, jokes) seem to be expendable over computerterminals, where each utterance costs the speaker more.The messages take longer to produce, are less transi-tory, and can be absorbed more carefully, so there isless asking for orientation, elaboration, and correction\[3\].
What devices are likely to be borrowed fromrelated but more familiar communication frames \[i\]?Possible frames are letters or telephone conversations.4.
Should and how can these functions be incorporatedinto the ideal natural language systems of the farfuture and the simple service systems of the nearfuture \[2\], \[8\]?REFERENCESI.
