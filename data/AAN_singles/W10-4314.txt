However, correctly recognizing temporal aspects of events poses serious challenges.
This paper introduces a joint modeling framework and feature set for temporal analysis of events that utilizes Markov Logic.
The feature set includes novel features derived from lexical on-tologies.
An evaluation suggests that in-troducing lexical relation features im-proves the overall accuracy of temporal relation models.
1 Introduction Reasoning about the temporal aspects of events is a critical task in discourse understanding.
Temporal analysis techniques contribute to a broad range of applications including question answering and document summarization, but temporal reasoning is complex.
A recent series of shared task evaluation challenges proposed a framework with standardized sets of temporal analysis tasks, including identifying the temporal entities mentioned in text, such as events and time expressions, as well as identifying the tem-poral relations that hold between those temporal entities (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009).
Our previous work (Ha et al, 2010) addressed modeling temporal relations between temporal entities and proposed a supervised machine-learning approach with Markov Logic (ML) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).
As novel fea-tures, we introduced two types of lexical rela-tions derived from VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
Apreliminary evaluation showed the effectiveness of our approach.
In this paper, we extend our previous work and conduct a more rigorous evaluation, focusing on the impact of joint opti-mization of the features and the effectiveness of the lexical relation features for modeling tempo-ral relations.
2 Related Work Recently, data-driven approaches to modeling temporal relations for written text have been gaining momentum.
Boguraev and Ando (2005) apply a semi-supervised learning technique to recognize events and to infer temporal relations between time expressions and their anchored events.
Mani et al (2006) model temporal rela-tions between events as well as between events and time expressions using maximum entropy classifiers.
The participants of TempEval-1 in-vestigate a variety of techniques for temporal analysis of text (Verhagen et al, 2007).
While most data-driven techniques model temporal relations as local pairwise classifiers, this approach has the limitation that there is no systematic mechanism to ensure global consis-tencies among predicted temporal relations (e.g., if event A happens before event B and event B happens before event C, then A should happen before C).
To avoid this drawback, a line of re-search has explored techniques for the global optimization of local classifier decisions.
Cham-bers and Jurafsky (2008) add global constraints over local classifiers using Integer Linear Pro-gramming.
Yoshikawa et al (2009) jointly model related temporal classification tasks using ML.
These approaches are shown to improve the ac-curacy of temporal relation models.
Our work is most closely related to Yoshikawa et al (2009) in that ML is used for joint model-75ing of temporal relations.
We extend their work in three primary respects.
First, we introduce new lexical relation features.
Second, our model addresses a new task introduced in TempEval-2.
Third, we employ phrase-based syntactic features (Bethard and Martin 2007) rather than depend-ency-based syntactic features.
3 Data and Tasks We use the TempEval-2 data for English for both training and testing of our temporal relation models.
The data includes 162 news articles (to-taling about 53,000 tokens) as the training set and another 11 news articles as the test set.
The corpus is labeled with events, time expressions, and temporal relations.
Each labeled event and time expression is further annotated with seman-tic and syntactic attributes.
Six types of temporal relations are considered: before, after, overlap, before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after, and vague.
Consider the following example from the TempEval-2 data, marked up with a time expres-sion t1 and three events e1, e2, and e3, where e1 and e2 are the main events of the first and the second sentences, respectively, and e3 is syntac-tically dominated by e2.
But a [minute and a half]t1 later, a pilot from a nearby flight [calls]e1 in.
Ah, we just [saw]e2 an [explosion]e3 up ahead of us here about sixteen thousand feet or something like that.
In the first sentence, t1 and e1 are linked by a temporal relation overlap.
Temporal relation af-ter holds between the two consecutive main events: e1 occurs after e2.
The main event e2 of the second sentence overlaps with e3, which is syntactically dominated by e2.
In this paper, we focus on three subproblems of the temporal relation identification task as de-fined by TempEval-2: identifying temporal rela-tions between (1) events and time expressions in the same sentence (ET); (2) two main events in consecutive sentences (MM); and (3) two events in the same sentence when one syntactically dominates another (MS), which is a new task in-troduced in TempEval-2.
4 Features Surface features include the word tokens and stems of the words.
In the TempEval-2 data, an event always consists of a single word token, buttime expressions often consist of multiple tokens.
We treat the entire string of words in a given time expression as a single feature.
Semantic features are the semantic attributes of individual events and time expressions de-scribed in Section 3.
In this work, we use the gold-standard values for these features that were manually assigned by human annotators in the training and the test data.
Syntactic features include three features adopted from Bethard and Martin (2007): gov-prep, any prepositions governing the event or time expression (e.g., ?for?
in ?for ten years?
); gov-verb, the verb governing the event or time expression; gov-verb-pos, the part-of-speech (pos) tag of the governing verb.
We also consider the pos tag of the word in the event and the time expression.
Lexical relations are the semantic relations be-tween two events derived from VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
VerbOcean contains five types of relations (similarity, strength, antonymy, en-ablement, and happens-before) that commonly occur between pairs of verbs.
To overcome data sparseness, we expanded the original VerbOcean database by calculating symmetric and transitive closures of key relations.
With WordNet, a se-mantic distance between the associated tokens of each target event pair was computed.
5 Modeling Temporal Relations with Markov Logic ML is a statistical relational learning framework that provides a template language for defining Markov Logic Networks (MLNs).
A MLN is a set of weighted first-order clauses constituting a Markov network in which each ground formula represents a feature (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).
Our MLN consists of a set of formulae com-bining two types of predicates: hidden and ob-served.
Hidden predicates are those that are not directly observable during test time.
A hidden predicate is defined for each task: relEventTimex (temporal relation between an event and a time expression), relMainEvents (temporal relation between two main events), and relMainSub (temporal relation between a main and a domi-nated event).
Observed predicates are those that can be fully observed during test time and repre-sent each of the features described in Section 4.
The following is an example formula used in our MLN:76eventTimex(d, e, t)  eventWord(d, e, w)            relEventTimex(d, e, t, r)       (1) The predicate eventTimex(d, e, t) represents the existence of a candidate pair of event e and time expression t in a document d. Given this candi-date pair, formula (1) assigns weights to a tem-poral relation r whenever it observes a word to-ken w in the given event from the training data.
This formula is local because it considers only one hidden predicate (relEventTimex).
In addition to local formulae, we also define a set of global formulae to ensure consistency be-tween local decisions: relEventTimex(d, e1, t, r1)  relEventTimex(d, e2, t, r2)  relMainSub(d, e1, e2, r3)           (2) Formula (2) is global because it jointly concerns more than one hidden predicate (relEventTimex and relMainSub) at the same time.
This formula ensures consistency between the predicted tem-poral relations r1, r2, and r3 given a main event e1, a syntactically dominated event e2, and a time expression t shared by both of these events.
Two additional global formulae (3) and (4) are simi-larly defined to ensure consistency as below.
relMainSub(d, e1, e2, r3)  relEventTimex(d, e2, t, r2)    relEventTimex(d, e1, t, r1)       (3) relMainSub(d, e1, e2, r3)  relEventTimex(d, e1, t, r1)    relEventTimex(d, e2, t, r2)       (4) 6 Evaluation To evaluate the proposed approach, we built and compared two models: one model (NoLex) used all of the features described in Section 4 except for the lexical relation features, and the other model (Full) included the full set of features.
The features were generated using the Porter Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer in NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) and the Charniak Parser (Charniak, 2000).
The semantic distance between two word tokens was computed using the path-similarity metric provided by NLTK.
All of the models were constructed using Markov TheBeast (Riedel, 2008) The feature set was optimized for each task on a held-out development data set consisting of approximately 10% of the entire training set (Ta-ble 1).
Our previous work (Ha et al, 2010) ob-served that a local optimization approach that selects for each individual task (i.e., each hidden predicate in the given MLN) in isolation from the other tasks could harm the overall accuracy of a joint model because of resulting inconsistenciesamong individual tasks.
In the new experiment described in this section, features were selected for each task to improve overall accuracy of the joint model combining all three tasks, similar to Yoshikawa et al (2009).
Table 2 reports the resulting performance (F1 scores) of the models.
To isolate the potential effects of global constraints, we first compare the accuracies of the Full and the NoLex model, av-eraged from a ten-fold cross validation on the training data before global constraints are added.
Full achieves relative 12% and 3% improve-ments over NoLex for temporal relation between events and time expressions (ET) and between two main events (MM), respectively.
The im-provement for MM was statistically significant (p<0.05) from a two-tailed paired t-test.
Note that the ET task itself does not use lexical rela-tion features but still achieves an improved result in Full over NoLex.
This is an effect of joint modeling.
There is a slight degradation (relative 2%) in the accuracy for temporal relations be-tween main and syntactically dominated events (MS).
Overall, Full achieves relative 5% im-provement over NoLex.
A similar trend of per-formance improvement in Full over NoLex was observed when the global formulae were added to each model.
The second column (Global Con-straints) of Table 2 compares the two models trained on the entire training set and tested on the test set after the global formulae were added.
However, no statistical significance was found on these improvements.

7 Conclusions Temporal relations can be modeled with Markov Logic using a variety of features including lexi-cal ontologies.
Three tasks relating to the Tem-pEval-2 data were addressed: predicting tempo-ral relations between (1) events and time expres-sions in the same sentence, (2) two main events in consecutive sentences, and (3) two events in the same sentence when one syntactically domi-nates the other.
An evaluation suggests that util-izing lexical relation features within a joint mod-eling framework using Markov Logic achieves state-of-the-art performance.
The results suggest a promising direction for future work.
The proposed approach assumes events and time expressions are already marked in the data.
To construct a fully automatic tempo-ral relation identification system, the approach needs to be extended to include models that rec-ognize events and time expressions in text as well as their semantic attributes.
A data-driven approach similar to the one described in this pa-per may be feasible for this new modeling task.
It will entail exploring a variety of features to fur-ther understand the complexity underlying the problem of temporal analysis of events.
