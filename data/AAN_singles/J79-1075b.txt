FINDLER AND SHU-HWA LEEDepartment of Computer ScienceSta te  University of New York a t  Buffalo4226 Ridge Lea RoadAmherst, New Yokk 14226ABSTRACTWe describe the continuation of an earlier b70rk on theprbblm of lexical coverage.
The objective is to proveexperimentally certain mathematical conjectures concerning t h erelationshi?
between the sizes of the covering and covered setsof words, an&-- maximun lenqth of dictionary def in i t ions .
Thedata base on which the experiments are cerried sut bas been alsoextended t6 the full contents -of an existinq dictionary ofcomputer terminology.
The rwults of the previous and presentwork lay the foundqtions for quantitative studies on lexicalvalence and its relation to the frequency of usage and otherpr inc ip les  ofb ditztionary selection.Besides t h e  inherent interest in t-hese investigations , theconcepts dealt with and the methods of cgantifying dictionaryvariables may eventually lead to more' efficient dictionaries withrespect to precision, compactness, and computer time andmemoryneeded for processing.Supported by ASF Grant MCS 76-24278.First, we shall introduce the problem define same basicterms and provide a brief historical account of pi(st results.
Inorder t o  rendter t h i s  paper fiairly self-sufficient, @ briefsunwry o f  th& previous work, Flndler Viil (1974) , %"ill af  sohave t o  be giken.A mono1 ingual dictionary may be considered economical andefficient if a mall set of words are used to def ine  a relativelylarge set o f  entties.
Quantitative information as to what sizevocabulary is needed to cover a given number of entries is veryscarce and may be characterized by two "data points*:The New Method Enalish Dictionary published by N.P.
B e s t  andJ.G.
Endicott in 1961 uses 1,490 self-defined basic words toexplain some 10,000 words and 6,000 idioms, i .e .
about 24,000expressions, Thus, the size ra t io  is 0.062.Oqien's Basic Engl i sh ,  published in 1933, involves 850English words and 50 !
!internationaly words t o  defihe 20,OOuEnglTsh words.
The ratio of the covering and covered set sizesis 0.045.The basis of selection was the Wusefulness" of the  wordsemployed in the def in i t ions ,  as opposed to  the  freouencg of theiroccurrence in some standard texts.
Howelvet , neither this conceptnor other principles  of selection suggested by o t h e r  researchershave ever been quantitatively analyzes and made use of.
We  halldiscuss these issues later on.In order to approach the problem in definite terns, Findler( 1 970) considered three basic variables :(i) the c~ver inp  set ,  I R t  qf sfze vR,-(ii) the covered set ,  - S, of s i z e  us,-(iii) the  maximum fief i n i t i o n  leffpth, -I N such that each wordin I) S can be def ined hy a t  most - N ordered words from - R.The t a s k  was formulated t o  f ind(4 v, as a fpnct ion  of vS at different parmetric values- -of N, andI(b) V~ a s  a function of - P.r a t  different parametric ValuesCal l inu  AvR/AvS increment ratio and vR/vS size rat io,  thefollowing cbn) ectures vere made concernina the f Srst task :(a l )   he , increment ratio is, in general, less than one.
(a2) The increment ratio, in general, decreases as vsincreases ,(a3) For larue constant values or Nt vR - approaches a-l imitin?

When N=1, the coveringand the covered se ts  are of the same s i z e ,  i .

In t h i s  caser the increment r a t i o  is 0 and the sizeratio becomes less than 1 .

t h epresent, second stage of our study,THE DATA BASE AND THE PRWRA'We have e ~ t e n d e d  the data base used in our preaious work,Findler and V i i l  (1.974).
The whole contents of the alcwonary oncomputer technalooy, Chandar (1970) , is now included in t h epresenr study.
Its structure, cathex simple and unif  arm, isdescribed below.

Also.
each word J.s coded as astriha of a t  moat 10 characters (containable in one CDC Cybercomputer word).
The abbrevhtians ere still easy to *ad withrelatively short practice.Only the dominant meanincj bf poJgsemous terms was dea l twith.
Each entrv .\ has thus one meaning and one def in i t ion .Termr in the definit ions (elements of the coverfng set) arealso qonsidored l e x i c a l  items, L e .
even multiword entl.t~esappear as a sfnple  un i t  and are represented by at most 10characters,The bas ic  vocabulary, that is the covering set,  consist^ ofelements tha.t also appeap i n  thq pvered set-.

I A , YSyntax is ,  perhaps, the most widely studied sub J ect i n  l inguist ics  todayGiven that t h i s  is so, there ig a real need for linguists, both profess$onaland student, to understand the extreme d i f f i c u l t y  of the  task of writinga grammar for a language That attempts are made to do this without the aidof a computer is perhaps a l l  the evidence one needs to  see that the diff icultiesare not well understood.
A formal granmar, particularly one written inthe notations commonly used today, is very much like a computer progrm Itis a l i s t  of instruct ions  for generating a list o f  strings, a computer programis a l i s t  of instruct ions  for performing some process (which might begenerating a list of strings) Both need to be precise, both are very complex,both suffer from the fact that a change i n  one part of the ordered l ist maycause an unanticipated change in  the effect of another part It would bevery surprising to f ind  that l ingu i s t s  were better a t  producing untested, yetcorrect, #formal charac'terizations of complex processes than computerprogrammers I eXpect that testing a newfy written gtammar w i l l  be asenlightening as experience far a lihguisaics student as debugging a newcodolex program is for a gompuer science student,Furthennore, just as the computer is sf uae i n  studying phonology andmorphology, i t  can also o f f e r  d a t a  organizat ion s e r v i c e s t t o  a i d  i n  the  studyof syntax Automated t a c t i c  a n a l y s i s  of syntax is still a research  p r o j e c t ,the!

Hays, Publisher.
"When the computing market was dominated by j u s t  a fewbig  companies," Hays says, "it was f a i r l y  easy t o  decide howto handle a computing problem.
Once a buyer had settled ona computing budget, the market might offer only two o r  thteemain frames big enough and cheap enough to do the  job .
Nowthe buyer can design a machine to f i t  a~purpose, and 'has tochoose components o u t  of lists that run up t o  dozens ofalternatives.
The worst part is, no one publishes th@ list!
"THE PRESS intends to correct part of the problem bymaking useful information about the market available in easylanguage and inexpensive format.
"Before long," Hays expectsth.e hardware and software reviews will be accessible onlinef o r  clients 60 dial  in.

THE PRESS invites anyuser of any microhardware or software to write it up; the- more -From THE PRESS at Twin Willows - !lay 23, 1978 72editors at THE PRESS will rewrite if necessary, make surethat the evaluations are not illegally harsh, and eliminatethe most obvious errors.
No fees are offered to reviewersat present, but a change is contemplated.
"Everyone whohelps should be paid," as Hays puts it.Manufacturers and software houses can send their listsand item descriptions to be included with the evaluations.THE PRESS, tvhich will also publish original material inwhatever technical fields need i t s  services, is "mostly amethod," Hays says.
Its purpose is to teach informationusers how to cooperate with each o the r ,  making centralpublishing f ess relevant.Hays, who is setting up THE PRESS, is a professor oflinguistics and of computer science in the State Universityof New York at Buffalo.
He moved to Buffal'o from The RANDCorporation in 1968 after 13 years of research on languageand computing.

The AssocPation w i l l  choose anew Edi tor ;  a t  t h e  same time, I think that some changes i noperations are appropriate ' .I n  the  1960s, I proposedLibrary development ; b u tphotographic s torage  hadt i m e  i s  now up.the  use of ult~amicrofiches forI said, if I d i d  not write, thata time limit; and t he  predictedTo supplement my University salary, I: am organizing The Pressat Twin Willows.
The enclosure describes the earliest formo.f the venture; I hope for r a p i d  evolut ion.It would be to say commercial advantage to a c t  as publisher.for AJCL.
I believe that if ACL adopts the word-processingand lexicographic businesses as areas o f  applied computa- r\.t ional  linguistics the Association can grow and serve' a sig-nificant role i n  improvement of the common weal; and for ThePress to help would be very pleasant  and p r o f i t a b l e .hs Editor,that I p a i ds i t y  gave.Press reduntions' f o r  s1 have contrf o r  myself,The new Edidam; in thaecondary pubibuted t h e  use ofand some small htor may have moret case, I shouldl i ca t ions  extractspwa and equipmente l p  thar: the Univer -to of fe r  , making Thelike to open negot ia-ed from AJCL.The Press cannot offer quite so much; i t  will be necessary tob i l l  the Association for machine time and personnel c o s t s .But only out-of-pocket costs w i l l  appear on invoices if theAssociation decides to deal with The Press.As for member services, we can continue microfiches; of fe rhard cdpy; move up quickly o r  slowly to typographicr quality ;issue newsletters along with qt iar ter ly  journal ; and giveonline access to computer files.
Most of that  can be doneimmecktately, but  some of it may have to wait a few months.It is up to t he  Association to say what it needs, i f  anythingSincerelyAmerican Journal of Cornputfional Linguist'ics Microfiabe 15:  74A S I S: 4 1 s ~  ANNUAL MEETINGNOVEMBER 13 - 17NEW YORK CITYTHEME: THE IMFORMATIOII AGE I N  PERSPECTIVE36 Technical Sessions in three general areas:COLLEUCION, GENERATION, AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATIONDISSEMINATION OF INFORMATIONINFORMATION FOR DECISION-MAKING AND CONTROLFOR MORE INFORMAT~ION CONTACT: ASIS1155 16th St ree t ,  N .
