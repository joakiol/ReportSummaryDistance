ROBUST CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNIT IONTECHNOLOGYPROGRAM SUMMARY*Clifford J. Weinstein and Douglas B. Paul, Principal InvestigatorsLincoln Laboratory,  M.I .T.Lexington, MA 02173-9108PROGRAM GOALSThe major objective of this program is to develop anddemonstrate robust, high performance continuous peechrecognition (CSR) techniques focussed on applications inSpoken Language Systems (SLS).
The effort focusses on de-veloping advanced acoustic modelling, efficient search tech-niques, rapid enrollment, and adaptation techniques for ro-bust large vocabulary CSR.
An additional Lincoln goal isto define and develop application of robust CSR to militaryand civilian systems, and to expedite ffective technologytransfer.BACKGROUNDThe Lincoln program began with a focus on improvingspeaker stress robustness for the fighter aircraft environ-ment.
A robust hidden Markov model (HMM) system wasdeveloped with very high performance under stress condi-tions.
The robust HMM techniques were then extended toyield state-of-the-art performance on the DARPA ResourceManagement corpus, using a tied-mixture HMM CSR ap-proach.Recent work has focussed on the large-vocabulary WallStreet Journal (WSJ) corpus, with vocabularies of5K, 20K,and up to 64K words.
The HMM CSR has been convertedto a stack-decoder-based control strategy to operate effi-ciently with good performance in these tasks.RECENT ACCOMPL ISHMENTSRecent accomplishments include: (1) development of thestack decoder and demonstration f its effectiveness on vo-cabularies up to 64K words; (2) development and integra-tion of fast-match and detailed match; (3) further develop-ment of acoustic modelling techniques for the large vocabu-lary task; (4) a full set of evaluation tests in the November1992 WSJ tests, including (e.g.)
a 4.5% error rate on a5K speaker-dependent test; (5) development ofrecognition-time speaker adaptation techniques with substantial im-provements due to adaptation from both speaker-specificand speaker-independent initial models; (6) participationin and contributions to development of the WSJ corpus,*THIS WORK WAS SPONSORED BY THE DEFENSE AD-VANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY.
