1 IntroductionVP El l ips is  in a DRT- implementat ionJohan BosDepartment of Computational Linguistics,Faculty of Arts, University of Groningen,P.O.Box 716, 9700 AS Groningen.Email: sO615838@let.rug.alKlein \[Klein, 1986\] introduced Predicate-DRSs forthe resolution of VP Ellipsis.
In that approach aPredicate~DRS (henceforth PDRS) serves as the rep-resentation ofa verb phrase, as will be shown in anexample now.
Consider:Nancy likes a cat.
(1) Betty does too.This discourse is interpreted as meaning that Nancyand Betty both like a cat (though not necessarilythe same cat).
The source clause, Nancy likes a cat,parallels the target clause Betty does too, where thesubjects are parallel elements.
The phrase does toorepresents a trace of the VP in the target clause.Klein's treatment of (1) is shown in (2).
(2)Xl Xs PIXl "- Nancy\[Yl\] Y2PI(xl): cat(ys)like(y1 ,Ys)xs "- BettyPdx2)In the second sentence of (1), a do-anaphor appearsthat must be linked to a marker which has alreadybeen introduced into the universe of the DtLS.
Thevalue of this marker, which is P1, as we can see in (2),is constrained by the conditions associated with theprevious VP in the discourse \[Klein, 1986\].
FollowingKlein, we call P1 a predicate marker, and the Sub-DRS that is associated with Pt a Predicate-DRS.
Tothe domain of P1, a distinguished reference markerYl (indicated by square brackets) is added, whichplays the role of the individual, in this case xl whichis applied to the predicate.
This application can alsobe shown as a lambda expression:(3) A Yl (cat(ys) A like (YhYs)) (xl)In (2) the condition Ps(xs) in the main DRS willapply the object xs to the predicate and solve thedo-anaphor in (1).
The scope of marker Ys is de-fined by the PDILS, instead of the main DRS, whichallows that Nancy and Betty do not necessarily ikethe same cat.But this same feature introduces a problem for pro-noun resolution.
This problem occurs when pro-nouns refer to indefinite NPs which are in the uni-verse of a PDRS and therefore inaccessible.
Let usgive an example by considering the DRS (5) as thetranslation of (4).Nancyt likes a cats.
(4) She1 strokes its.
(5)xl P1 P2xl = Nancy\[Yl\] YsP I (xi)I cat (Ys)\[ like(yl,y2)\[Y3\]Ps(xl): stroke(y3,?
)Since, in DRT, an anaphor can only refer to an-tecedents from its own domain or from universesthat its DRS subordinates, the pronoun it cannotbe anaphorically linked to the indefinite descriptiona cat.
This means, in the situation of (5), candi-date antecedents for it can only be found in the mainD1LS, since Pz is subordinated to it.
The desirableantecedent y2 in P1 is blockedJA solution to the problem of the indefinite descrip-tions appearing in PDRSs, is to make them accessiblein the main DRS.
This paper shows, by slightly mod-ifying Klein's PDRSs, how that can be done, withoutlosing their desirable characteristics.Firstly, we outline informally how indefinite descrip-tions in PDRSs are made accessible.
Then we showhow this idea relates to aspects like negation, disjunc-tion, quantification and the strict/sloppy identity ofVP Ellipsis.
Finally, we report about the implemen-tation under development.1Notice, that proper names and definite descriptionsdo not give rise to this problem.
In DRT, these areusually added to the universe of the main DRS \[Kampand Reyle, 1990\] or accommodated to it \[Van derSandt,1992\].4252 A new approach toPredicate-DRSsBy treating a PDRS just as an ordinary DRS, withthe distinction that there is a correspondence b -tween the arguments which are applied to the PDRSand the members of its domain, it is possible to ex-tend the scope of reference markers in a PDRS totheir superordinated DRS.
The best way to showhow this works is to look at a DRS for (4) in thisnew approach:(6)Xl  X2  PI P2X 1 -- Nancyl Yl Y2P1 (xl ,x2):l cat(y2)Ilike(yl,Y~)P2(xl) stroke(y3,x~)In (6), in the PDRS P1, Yl is linked to Xl, and y2to x2.
So, the difference here to Klein's approach isthat, besides the referent for the individual which isapplied to the PDRS, all indefinite descriptions inthe universe of the PDRS are associated with corre-sponding arguments as well.
2 A lambda expressionfor P1 in (6) is:(7) A Yl A Y2 (cat(y2) A like(yl,y2)) (xl) (x2)This treatment allows that we can refer to the indefi-nite cat, as is done in P2 of (6).
An added advantageis that we maintain the original properties ofa PDtLSoutlined previously.
Note, that the number of argu-ments applied to a PDRS directly depends on thenumber of indefinite descriptions in the VP.
Conse-quently, a VP with a ditransitive verb could yieldtwo indefinite descriptions, as in (8).
Optional rela-tive clauses can raise this number even higher (9).
(8) Nancy gives a man an iron.Nancy likes a man who has an iron that(9) a woman gave him.3 NegationConcerning predicate negation, we will assume thatthe scope of negation does not embrace the subject(cf \[Kamp and Reyle, 1990\]).
The approach we take2Therefore, it is not necessary to distinguish themwith square brackets any more.
Note that the agent cor-responds to the first referent in the PDRS.here is similar to standard DRT,  because a new sub-ordinated DRS affixed with a negation symbol is in-troduced in case of negation.
Let us consider (10):(I0) Nancy1 doesn't own a cats.
* Shel beats it2.Here we simply negate the predicate by constructingthe PDRS in a negated DRS.
In (10) the pronoun itdoes not permit a link to the NP a cat, and this seemsto be the case in general as well, because negationblocks anaphoric links.
8Thus, in the case of a negated VP, the indefinites areraised to the superordinated DRS which is the DRSfor negation.
This construction is figured in DRS(11) and causes exactly the result we wish: it cannotbe linked to cat because the referent for cat, x2, isnot accessible.
(11)X1 P1 P2xl ---- Nancy Ix2 \[-~ PI(Xl,X2):Yl Y~cat(y2)own(yl ,Y2)l y3P2(xl): beat(y3,?
)Now consider (12), where an anaphoric link betweencat and it is permitted.
At first sight, this sentencewould appear as a counterexample to our character-ization of negation.
But it is not, if we interpret themeaning of it as (13):(12) Either Nancy doesn't own a cat,or she beats it.
(13) Either Nancy doesn't own a cat,or she does and she beats it.An  interpretation of (12) as (13) permits the acces-sibility of cat in (12).
In our DRT-framework withPDRSs  we easily can obtain a DRS for (12), as thedisjunction of two SubDRSs.
Then, in one disjunctpredicate negation takes place, while in the other the3However, \[Kamp and Reyle, 1990\] give as a possiblecounterexample to this generalization the discourse Jonesdoes not llke a Porsche.
He owns it, interpreting it bysaying that there is some Porsche that Jones both dislikesand owns.
According to me, such an interpretation seemsonly permitted if that Porsche is already uttered in theprocessed iscourse.426do-anaphor is resolved, resulting in a accessibility forthe indefinite NP a cat.
(14)xl PI P2xl = NancyX2Yl Y2"~ PI(Xl,X2): cat(y2)own(yl ,Y2) I Vx3P1(xl ,x3)4 QuantificationIn this section we will see how the quantifiers everyand no can be treated.
We will demonstrate howquantification matches perfectly with our proposalsabout PDRSs and negation.
Sentence (15)(15) Every woman likes a cat.involves applying the quantified NP every woman tothe PDRS, visualized in DRS (16):(16)P1X1woman(xl) IX2- - *  PI(xI,x2):Yl Y2cat(y~)like(yl,y2)Of interest here is that the argument of P1 is themember of the antecedent DRS: xl.
Also worth not-ing is that the referent of the indefinite a cat in P1is not raised to the main DRS but to the DRS thatholds the consequent of the implication relation.
Inthis case the NP a cat has narrow scope within thequantified phrase every woman, and therefore notaccessible in the main DRS (as in standard DRT).In a similar way the quantifier no is interpreted, us-ing the logical equivalence of the formulae (17) and(18):(17)-,3z P(z) A Q(x)(18)YxP(z )  ---*~Q(x)The traditional way to translate no in DRT is basedon (17).
4 In this framework we use predicate nega-4Several proposals have been made to treat gener-alized quantifiers in DRT.

(19) No woman likes a dog.
(20)P1 Ix2 { xl 1 Yl Y2woman(xl) \]"" PI(Xl,X2) dog(y2)like(yl,y2)This way of dealing with quantification is exactlywhat we need for VP Ellipsis resolution.
A discourseas in (19) could proceed with a sentence like: BatPeter does, and he beats it, which is an example of a'missing antecedent' \[Hankamer and Sag, 1976\], sincethe pronoun it lacks an overt antecedent because theNP a dog is in the scope of negation and thereforenot accessible.
By generating a condition in D1LS(20) applying Peter to the PDRS PI, the 'missing'antecedent is found (21).iX3 X4X1(21)P1 P2woman(xi)x3 = PeterPI(X3,X4)P2(x3) t :;at(y3,x4)Ix2( )"~ PI Xl,X2 :Yl Y2dog(y2)like(yl,y2)Summarizing so far, we have shown that PDRSs,with the ability to raise indefinite descriptions to itssuperordinated DRS, can be used quite effectively inour framework.
Mainly, we distinguished two caseswhere referents of indefinite descriptions were notraised to the main DRS, but to a DIgS subordinatedto the top level.
The first case concerns predicatenegation, where a negated DRS is superordinated tothe PDRS involved.
The second case concerns quan-tification, where the PDRS is subordinated to theconsequent-DRS of the implication relation.5 Strict and Sloppy ReadingsThis section shows how sloppy and strict readingsarising in VP Ellipsis are obtained.
Discourses like(22) are ambiguous as to whether Betty strokes427Nancy's cat (the strict reading) or Betty strokesBetty's cat (the sloppy reading).
(22) Nancy strokes her cat.Betty does too.Following \[Van der Sandt, 1992\], presuppositions areaccommodated to the preceding discourse.
That is, ifdiscourse does not provide an antecedent, one will becreated.
In processing the first sentence of (22), DRS(23) is obtained, where the presuppositional posses-sive construction her cat is paraphrased in a dashedDRS to indicate information for accommodation.
(23)xl P1X 1 --" NancyYlstroke(y1 ,y~)Yy2 P iZl Z2 !P(Y,Y2): cat(z~) 1poss(zl ,z2)In the approach of \[Van der Sandt, 1992\] theanaphoric material in the dashed DRS is resolvedafter merging the DRS constructed for the sentencewith the main DRS, resulting in a new DRS thatcontains no anaphoric material for accommodationstill to be processed.
This procedure is followed for(23) yielding DRS (24).xl x2 P1 P2xl = NancyZ1 Z2P2(XI,X2) I cat(z2)(24) \[ poss(zl ,z2)PI(X1) t Y\[!!ir--!!!i!!
!i!iiiDiscourse (22) provides one suitable antecedent forthe possessor, namely Nancy, and Nancy possesses acat is established in the DRS.
But this gives us onlythe strict reading when in case of an elliptical VP inthe proceeding discourse is referred to P1, which isthe case in (22).To represent the sloppy reading, the anaphoric ma-terial in (23) that holds the presupposition must notbe resolved at the stage of DRS-merging, but leftthere to provide accommodation a other time (withother constraints, that depend on the antecedent ofthe possessor).
In this way both the strict and sloppyreading are obtainable in case of VP Ellipsis.We show this proposal with our example (22), cor-responding with DRS (25).
Similar to (24), the pre-supposition causes an antecedent to be created (i.e.Nancy possesses a cat), with this difference, that theanaphoric material is not resolved.
The VP-anaphorfinds as an antecedent PI: strokes her cat.
The pre-suppositional material in the dashed DRS can now beaccommodated to two different antecedents: Firstly,Nancy, where no antecedent has to be created for thepossessive construction, resulting in the strict read-ing.
Secondly, the newly introduced Betty, where inthat case the presupposition Betty possesses a catis accommodated and the sloppy reading can be de-rived.
The latter is shown in (25):(25)xl x2 xa x4 P1 P2 P3xl : NancyZl Z2P2(Xl,X2) cat(z2)poss(zl,z2)Pl(xl):Ylstroke(y1 ,Y2)YY2 PZl z2P(Y,Y2):I cat(z2) .Ixa = BettyZl z2Pa(x3,x4): cat(z2)poss(zl ,z~)Pl(Xa)If we compare this approach to the higher-order uni-fication approach to VP Ellipsis of \[Dalrymple etal.,1991\], we can obtain all six readings of the compli-cated (26) generated by the equational analysis of\[Dalrymple et ai., 1991\].ore John revised his paper before the~v/teacher did, and Bill did too.The reading of (26) where John, the teacher, andBill all revised John's paper, is translated in a DRSwith the presupposition that John possesses a paper428accommodated to the main DRS.
The reading whereJohn and Bill revised their own papers before theteacher evised John's paper, causes accommodationtwice, once for John possesses a paper and once forBi l l  possesses a paper.
The other readings can beobtained analogously.6 ImplementationThe PROLOO-implementation is a natural anguageprocessing system which parses simple discourses,The way DRSs are constructed in this system willbe discussed concisely.The emphasis of the implementation lies on anaphoraresolution (like do-anaphora and pronouns) in a do-main of a small fragment of English.
A parse of atypical discourse is:> Mary likes a cat.> She does not beat it.> John does not either.drs : \[ xl x3 x6 p2 p5 \]\[ x l = maryp2(x l ,x3) : \ [  y x4 \]\[ cat (x4)l i ke (y ,x4)  \]not ?
3?
pS(xl):?
y \]\[ beat(y,x3) \] \]x6 = johnnot \[ \]?
pS(x~) \] \]This implementation differs from other PROLOG-implementations of DRT (e.g.
the threading ac-count of \[Johnson and Klein, 1986\]) in the way itconstructs DRSs.
Following lasher, 1990\], DRSsare constructed in a bottom-up fashion, using A-conversion.Each lexical entry is associated with a SubDRS, rep-resenting the meaning of that entry.
For instance,the lexical entries for a, man, and runs are:lex(apdet : \[agr=sing,def=ind,drsffi (X'P) "(X'Q) "drs( \[2, \[P ,Q\] )3 ).lex (mSll mnoun:  \[agr=sing,~s=X'~s  ( \[X\], \[man(X) 3 ,gender--male,refffiX\] ).lex (runs,iv: \ [agrfs ing,drsfX'drs ( D,  \[do(P ,X) :drs ( \[y\], \[run(y)\] )\] ),reffP\] ).As these entries make clear, a DtLS is constructed ofa PROLOG term containing two lists, where the firstone contains the discourse markers (i.e.
the domain)and the second one the constraints (these are repre-sented as PROLOG terms).
Furthermore, the lambdaabstractor is constructed as the PROLOG operator '^'(this idea is taken from \[Pereira nd Shieber, 1987\]).While parsing a sentence, the DtLS for that sen-tence is processed by A-conversion and merging, us-ing syntax rules of the following form 5 (as in \[Al-shawl, 1992\]):np:\[drs=Drs,agr=Agr .... \] --->\[det:\[drs=A2"Drs .... \],noun:\[drs=Al,agr=Agr .... \],optrel : \[drs=Al'A2,.

\ ] \ ] .The output of a sentence parse is a constructed DRSfor that sentence, but with referring expressions (ifany) still unresolved.
This sentence-DRS then ismerged with the ingoing DRS, representing the com-puted discourse so far.
During this merge, the fol-lowing computing actions take place:?
Computing of arguments for PDRSs;?
Resolving of Pronouns and'VP Ellipsis;?
Accommodation of Proper Names, Definite De-scriptions, and Possessive Constructions.An aid to these computations i  a historylist com-puted during the sentence parse.
This historylistcontains all the items that are represented in the dis-course, extended with information that is not purelysemantic, such as type and gender of certain sub-jects, but necessary for the computations mentionedabove.This results in a new DRS, capturing the entire dis-course, which will be the ingoing DtLS for the mergeafter the next sentence is parsed.7 Conc lus ionBy slightly changing Klein's treatment of Predicate-DRSs, that is making indefinite descriptions occur-ring in the scope of the VP accessible to the top levelof the main DRS, we obtain a much better mecha-nism for handling VP Ellipsis in DRT without losingany old characteristics in the theory.
Furthermore,we proposed to use Van der Sandt's theory on pre-suppositions in a different way in our framework toSFor reasons of clarity, some information i these rulesis omitted.429derive both strict and sloppy readings where possi-ble.This presentation is informal.
