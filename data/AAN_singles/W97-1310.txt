Corpus Annotation and Reference ResolutionA.
McEnery, L Tanaka & S. Botley,Department of Linguistics,Lancaster University,Bailrigg,Lancaster,LA1 4YTemail: mcenery @ comp.lancs.ac.ukAbstractA variety of approaches to annotatingreference in corpora have beenadopted.
This paper reviews fourapproaches to the annotation ofreference in corpora.
Following thiswe present a variety of results fromone annotated corpus, the UCRELanaphoric treebank, relevant toautomated reference resolution.IntroductionThe application of corpora to the problems ofpronoun resolution is a rapidly growing area ofcorpus linguistics.
Work by Dagan and Itai(1990) and Mitkov (1994, 1995, 1996; Mitkov,Choi and Sharp 1995) are good examples ofthis growth.
However, the application ofsuitably annotated corpora to the problem ofpronoun resolution has been largely hamperedto date by a lack of availability of suitablecorpus resources.
This paper is going to reviewwhat work has been undertaken in theproduction of corpora including discourseannotations.
We will then show whatquantitative data is available from such corporawhich can be of use in the construction ofrobust pronoun resolution systems.Corpus AnnotationWhile an increasingly wide range of linguisticanalyses (both automatically and manuallyproduced) are becoming available asannotations in corpora, morphosyntacticallyannotated corpora have long been available,and syntactically annotated corpora are nowbecoming more readily available too.Examples include the parsed LOB corpus, theSusanne corpus (Sampson, 1995) and the PennTreebanks.
While it is widely perceived thatappropriately annotated corpus data is ofimportance in the study of reference resolution,corpora which include appropriate discourseannotations have not become more readilyavailable in the public domain, however.Evidence for the growing appreciation of theimportance of anaphorically annotated corporacan be seen in the slow but sure growth of arange of corpus annotation systems forreference annotation in the 1990s - Fligelstone(1992), Aone and Bennett (1994), Botley(1996), de Rocha (1997) and Gaizauskas andHumphries (1997).
Yet while the proposals foran appropriately annotated corpus are growing,there is little corpus data available in EnglishkThe only corpus that is available, developed byAone and Bennett, has a variety ofshortcomings - it covers only one genre ofwritten language (newspaper articles), it dealsonly with anaphora, it is a corpus of Japaneseand Spanish 2, and its annotations were notproduced to meet the need of a wide range ofend-users, only participants in the fifth messageunderstanding competition.
Hence the workwhich has been undertaken with corpora in thefield of reference resolution has not been ableto exploit and evaluate the type of reliablequantitative data that an anaphoricallyannotated corpus could yield.Our aim at Lancaster over the past three yearshas been to develop a series of tools to retrievequantitative data on a range of referencefeatures in text.
We have done this on the basisof one corpus which was developed incollaboration with IBM Yorktown Heights, anda second which we have developed in-house.Neither of these corpora are available forgeneral release because of restrictions placedupon us by the providers of the corpus text.What we can release, however, are the resultsIt should be noted that other languages havealready started to generate such resources - Aoneand Bennett (1994) have been working on such acorpus for Japanese and Spanish.2 Aone and Bennett (1994:74) appreciate heimportance of extending this work to English.67of our mining of the corpus for quantitativedata.
This is the first publication aimed at therelease of such information.The uses to which such information may be putin anaphor resolution are obvious.
Usingquantitative data of this sort may be one meansof providing "knowledge poor" referenceresolution.
Also, as McEnery (1995) suggests,such quantitative data may be used to provide amore restricted search area for knowledgeintensive anaphor esolution systems to workin.
We believe that the data we present later inthis paper shows clearly, for one text type atleast, that the use of quantitative data to limitthe search space of a reference resolutionalgorithm is a possibility.Before we present any such data, however, wewill review the limited body of work that existsin thefield of reference resolution-orientedannotation i  corpus linguistics.
In doing so wewill cover two schemes developed at LancasterUniversity (Botley, 1996, Fligelstone, 1992),and two further schemes developed at Sheffieldand Sussex Universities (Gaizauskas andHumphries, 1997, de Rocha, 1997).
This typeof review is of interest because it shows therange of features that may be annotated in sucha corpus, and consequently gives a sense of thetype of quantitative data we may hope toextract from an appropriately annotated corpus.Press Newswire stories, and was developed aspart of a collaborative project between UCRELand IBM Yorktown Heights (Garside, 1993).The treebank is marked up using theIBM/UCREL discourse annotation scheme(Fligelstone, 1992).
This scheme encodes awide range of anaphoric and cohesive featuresbased on the typology of Halliday and Hasan(1976).
Each feature is associated withannotation symbols which encode the type ofrelationship involved, and the direction ofreference, where relevant.In addition to these features, it is possible tomark uncertainty (of direction of reference, orof the antecedent), multiple antecedents, andsemantic values on second and third-personpronouns.
For a more detailed treatment of theannotation scheme, see Fligelstone (1992).The UCREL discourse annotation scheme wasapplied to corpus texts using a tailor-builtediting tool, called XANADU (Garside, 1993).XANADU is an interactive tool which allowsan analyst to rapidly introduce cohesionannotations into corpus texts.
The tool wasdeveloped as part of the above-mentionedcollaborative project between UCREL andIBM Yorktown Heights (Garside, 1993: 5-27).Evaluation of the UCRELannotation schemeWork to DateHaving established that a range of annotationschemes are being developed to encodeanaphoric reference resolution in corpora, weneed to review this work here.
We need toreview it because in doing so one gains aflavour of the types of quantitative data thatmay become available in the near future fromthe fruit of such efforts.
When we havecompleted our review of four importantannotation schemes, we will go in and look insome detail at the type of data forthcomingfrom corpora annotated by one scheme, theLancaster scheme, and assess its potentialimpact upon practical, robust knowledge pooranaphor resolution.The UCREL Anaphoric TreebankThis treebank consists of 100,000 words ofmorphosyntactically-annotated AssociatedThe UCREL annotation scheme scores veryhighly in terms of granularity of analysis - it ispossible to mark a wide range of cohesivephenomena using the scheme.
This means thatit is possible to provide a corpus resourcewhich is very rich in data that could be usefulto an algorithm for resolving anaphora.However, one area of weakness is that it onlyworks effectively when marking antecedentsthat are surface linguistic strings, such as nounphrases and clauses.
It has been found,especially by Francis (Francis, 1994 as well asBotley (Botley, 1996) that some antecedentsare indirectly related to their anaphors.
Oneexample of this is where demonstrativeanaphors function to encapsulate or label(Francis, 1994) a large stretch of precedingdiscourse.
Using the existing UCRELannotation scheme, the only way of markingsuch a feature would be to place antecedentannotations around the entire previous text.While it is possible to do this for situationswhere an antecedent is a single sentence, it isfar from certain how to mark an antecedent that68is not a clearly identifiable surface element ofthe text.
Therefore, this class of 'indirectanaphors' are not easily markable using theUCREL scheme.
Despite this limitation, it isstill eminently feasible to mark surfaceantecedents.De Rocha's Work.In a notation scheme developed by Marco deRocha (de Rocha, 1997), spoken corpus texts 3in English and Portuguese are segmented andannotated according to the topic structure ofthe texts analysed.
This approach reflects thewidely-accepted view in discourse analysis andtext linguistics that the topic of the discourse 4tends to be the preferred antecedent for a givenanaphoric expression.
Therefore, de Rocha'sannotation is aimed at exploring the complexrelationships between anaphora nd discoursetopic.Firstly, de Rocha establishes, for eachdiscourse fragment under analysis, a globaltopic, or discourse topic.
The discourse topiccan be valid throughout a whole text, or maychange at different points, in which case, a newdiscourse topic will be established andannotated.
The discourse topic is annotatedabove the text fragment as a noun phrasewithin asterisks.
The next step is to divide thetext into discourse segments according to localtopic continuity.
This is done by assigning asegment topic, which is only valid throughouta given segment of the discourse.
Wheneverthe local topic changes, a new segment topic isassigned, and appropriate annotation is insertedmanually into the text.
Segment opics areannotated using the letter s, followed by anindex number, similar to those assigned usingthe UCREL scheme.Segments where further local topic shift occursare further subdivided into subsegments, withtheir own appropriate annotation, consisting ofthe string ss, followed by an index number aswith segment annotations.
Also, topics whichhave been dropped, but have been re-introduced in the conversation are also markedby adding the letter r to the s or ss annotationsfor discourse segments.3 de Rocha used extracts from the London-LundCorpus for his English data.4 Topic is known by various terms in the literature,for instance focus (Sidner, 1986) or center (Mitkov,1994b).As well as the above segment and subsegmentannotations, de Rocha's scheme allows fordiscourse segments to be annotated accordingto the discourse function they serve, forinstance 'introduce the discourse topic' isannotated using the string intro_dt.
Also, eachannotation string contains a short phrasedescribing the current opic for the segment orsubsegment under analysis.The final stage in de Rocha's analyticalframework is to annotate ach case of anaphorathat take place within the discourse segmentsidentified.
This is done by specifying fourproperties of anaphora:!.
type of anaphora, such as 'subject pronoun'or 'full noun phrase', with each type having itsown tag,2.
type of antecedent, defined as eitherimplicit or explicit, each of which is taggedseparately in the annotation,3.
topicality status of the antecedent, in otherwords whether the antecedent is the discoursetopic, segment topic or subsegment topic.4.
processing slot, by which anaphora casescan be classified according to the type ofknowledge used in processing them, such assyntactic, collocational or discourseknowledge.Evaluation of de Rocha'sannotation scheme.De Rocha's scheme has a number ofinnovations.
Primarily, it goes beyondannotating anaphoric cases in texts, andattempts to encode information about therelationship between anaphora nd topicality indiscourse, which goes a long way towardsproviding annotated corpora that can be used instudies of discourse structure and anaphora.Secondly, rather than simply identifyinganaphors and antecedents, it classifies themaccording to some rigorous criteria which aremore detailed than the framework laid down byHalliday and Hasan, which was at the core ofthe UCREL scheme.
Thirdly, de Rocha'sscheme is developed for use with spokendialogues in more than one language, whichintroduces extra analytical dimensions to thecorpus-based analysis of anaphora.
Andfinally, de Rocha introduces informationconcerning the kind of knowledge used inprocessing anaphors, which is not included inother schemes, but would be very useful in anyresearch that marries corpus-based descriptionwith a knowledge-based approach to anaphorresolution.69The main disadvantage to de Rocha's schemeis that it does not use a widely-accepted textencoding format in its annotation symbols, arequirement hat is becoming increasinglyimportant in modern corpus-based research.The next anaphoric annotation system to bedescribed here does do this, however.Gaizauskas and HumphriesSchemeHailiday and Hasan's framework), SyntacticFunction and Antecedent Type.Each case of demonstrative anaphora in a300,000 word corpus 5 was annotated with afive-character tag which encoded each of theabove values for each of the five featuresidentified.Evaluation of Botley's annotationscheme.Gaizauskas and Humphries (1997) use SGML(Standard Generalised Markup Language) tagsto annotate anaphoric expressions in texts usedin a coreference resolution task.
SGML isbecoming a widely-recognised standard forencoding electronic texts for interchangebetween different computer systems in naturallanguage ngineering research.Evaluation of Gaizauskas andHumphries' annotationThis system has the main advantage of being ina widely-recognised text interchange format.However, it only allows a small subset ofanaphoric relations to be marked, in this case,reference involving 'it'.
Also, the scheme wasdeveloped for use in a rigidly restrictedautomatic resolution task where the success ofeach annotation had to be measured.
It was notdeveloped for use on a large corpus-basedproject, as with other annotation schemesdescribed in this chapter.
Despite this,however, the SGML framework does provide auseful starting point by which other schemesmay be converted to SGML in the future.Botley's Annotation SchemeThe final annotation scheme to be describedhere was developed by Simon Botley (Botley,1996), and, like that of de Rocha, attempts toclassify anaphoric expressions according tovarious external criteria.
Botley's scheme wasdeveloped to describe the different ways inwhich demonstrative expressions functionanaphorically in written and spoken corpustexts.
Essentially, Botley classifiesdemonstrative anaphors according to fivedistinctive features, each of which can haveone of a series of values: Recoverability ofAntecedent ( he extent o which the antecedentis a recoverable surface string), Direction ofReference, Phoric Type (derived fromLike de Rocha, Botley's scheme has theadvantage of being able to mark a great dealmore information about anaphoric phenomenain the text than the UCREL scheme at presentcan.
Also, it is relatively straightforward toderive statistics concerning frequency ofoccurrence of particular demonstrative f aturesusing the Botley scheme, from whichsophisticated statistical modelling can becarried out.
Also, the Indirectly Recoverablevalue allows analysts to home in on areas ofdemonstrative anaphora which are worthy offurther study.
It was mentioned above that theUCREL scheme cannot provide muchinformation about those cases of anaphorawhere the antecedent is not an identifiablesurface noun phrase.
However, schemes whichclassify antecedents according to directness orindirectness of recoverability (Botley) orexplicitness versus implicitness (de Rocha) arehighly valuable and sensitive tools which canhelp analysts to derive richer descriptions ofparticular anaphoric features in a corpus.Findings to DateHaving reviewed the work undertaken onreference oriented corpus annotation to date,we can now present a few examples of the typeof data that we have extracted from theanaphoric treebanks held at Lancaster.
Itshould be emphasised that the data we arepresenting here is but a sample of the data wehave 6, which will be presented fully in Tanaka(1998) and Botley (forthcoming).
\[NOTE:need to say how many anaphors were detectedhere\] The data all refers to the genre ofnewswire reporting, using the anaphofictreebank described above.
Yet in presenting5 Consisting of 3xl00-word samples from theAssociated Press Treebank, the Canadian Hansardand the American Printing House for the BlindCorpus.6 Coming, as it does, from the 100,000 wordAnaphoric Treebank.70these samples of data we believe that we areshowing at least two things.
Firstly, thatexisting quantitatively oriented studies ofreference in English are generally supportable,as far as they go, by reference to corpus data.Secondly, and more importantly, it is possibleto go beyond the bounds of existing studies,and provide relevant quantitative data that isnot currently available.Table Two: Distance between referent andantecedent measured by number ofintervening sentences.A B C D E0 2073 44.29 % 2073 44.29 %1 1449 30.95 % 3522 75.24 %2 487 10.40 % 4009 85.64 %3 205 4.38 % 4214 90.02 %4 141 3.01 % 4355 93.04 %5 88 1.88 % 4443 94.92 %6 64 1.37 % 4507 96.28 %7 34 0.73 % 4541 97.01%8 37 0.79 % 4578 97.80 %9 21 0.45 % 4599 98.25 %10 20 0.43 % 4619 98.68 %I1 19 0.41 % 4638 99.08 %12 l0 0.21 % 4648 99.30 %13 9 0.19 % 4657 99.49 %14 7 0.15 % 4664 99.64 %15 6 0.13 % 4670 99.77 %16 2 0.04 % 4672 99.81 %17 5 0.It % 4677 99.91%18 l 0.02 % 4678 99.94 %19 2 0.04 % 4680 99.98 %21 1 0.02 % 4681 100.00%Key to table: A is numbers of interveningsentence boundaries, B is number ofoccurrences, C is rate of occurrences, D is thesum of occurrences to that point and E is rateof sum.Let us begin with the first case.
Ariel (1988)found a relatively normal distribution fordistance between anaphor and antecedent in thedata she observed.
We have tried a variety ofdistance measures (intervening NPs,intervening words, intervening sentences) andfound a very similar distribution in all cases.Table Two and Figure Five below show, indetail and graphically, how sentence distanceshows the behaviour of anaphors.The data in itself is quite remarkable, andshows a variety of points clearly.
First, thepreoccupation with intra-sentential anaphora ingenerative linguistics is shown to be unhealthy.Intra-sentential naphora is shown to be theminority case in this data.
Most anaphors in thedata sample are inter-sentential.
Any anaphorresolution system which dwells upon intra-sentential anaphora at the expense of inter-sentential anaphora is doomed to failure.Second, the behaviour of the anaphors isremarkably uniform.
In practical terms, if youaccepted that you were prepared to limit yoursearch for an antecedent five sentences distantfrom an anaphor, then although you would beplacing an upper limit on the accuracy of youralgorithm of 94.92%, you would be receiving abonus, in a reduction of some 75% of thepotential relevant search space.
If we assumethat with an increased search space accuracydeclines, then quantitatively motivatedlimitations such as that suggested may boostthe success rate of a knowledge intensivesystem which suffers from declining accuracyand speed with an open ended search space.Third, the majority of anaphors are either inter-sentential, or occur in the previous sentence.Admittedly, this observation only coversaround 75% of cases, but nonetheless, it isindicative of the type of probabilisticinformation that may be incorporated intosearch algorithms to aid with selection of anantecedent - if there is no case to choose onrational grounds between an antecedent fivesentences away and one in the previoussentence, the one in the previous sentence isfundamentally more likely to be the right one.Let us now move to our second point - usingannotated corpora to derive quantitative datanot available currently.
When we look at theanalysis above, and studies such as Ariel(1988), there is a great deal that this simpledistance oriented type of analysis does notshow.
Do all of the anaphors have the samepattern of distribution, for instance?
It may bethat this averaging of distances as shown intable one looks quite different when it isbroken down by anaphor.
Also, how dofeatures other than distance influence referenceresolution - for example, how do pronouns indirect quotations behave?
Do they haveantecedents beyond the scope of the quotationitself?Table 3: Distance data for each pronoun in direct speech and non-quoted textIlnterveningSentences 0 I 1 I 2 131415161718191101 1112113 I 1 I71I tI PP IS1 163 I 290in  DS 163 !

00 0 0OI  O~ 072The ways in which we have elaborated theanalysis presented above are numerous.
But forthe purpose of showing briefly and succinctlythe reasons why we may want to do a moredetailed analysis of our data, see Table 2below.
In this table, we have analysed sentencedistance for each pronoun, both within directspeech (line "in DS") and outside directspeech.
For purposes of presentation we havelimited the distance to 14 sentences, though asnoted previously, a few antecedents lie beyondthis range.
In the following table, each pronounhas two entries.
On the first line, the totalnumber of occurrences of each pronoun aregiven in each of the distance categoriesrepresented.
The second line gives the totalnumber of occurrences of each pronounappearing in direct speech in each distancecategory represented.Looking at this table, it is clear that allpronouns do not act alike, and further, that thedetermination of whether a pronoun is in directspeech or not can be of great practicalrelevance.
Most 7 first and second personpronouns (I, my, me, myself, we, our, us,ourselves, you, yours) only ever occur withindirect speech in this genre.
On examination ofthe text, their antecedent almost invariably liesbeyond the direct quotation itself.Consequently, it is noticeable that thesepronouns tend to have longer distance ties thanthe third person pronouns, as the quotationitself has been included within the distancemeasure.
If we look, for instance, at referencesoccurring at a distance of six sentences, I, we,us and you occurring in direct speech accountfor ten of the thirteen cases (the remainderbeing one each of he, his and they, of whichonly his occurs in direct speech).Overall, the predominant endency is stilltowards very short range reference - with mostantecedents being within one sentence of theanaphor.
There are a very few cases ofpronouns with a more substantial tail thanothers - 6.1% of the 504 cases of I observedhad an antecedent at two sentences distance,compared, say to the 213 cases of its, whichhas no antecedents more than one sentencedistant, and which only had 1.9% (4 cases) at 1sentence distance..7 In our discussion here, we will use the rawfreqeuncy data from the tables as the basis of ourdiscussion.
A more exacting statistical nalysis ofthe type of data we present here is given inTanaka(1998) and Botley (forthcoming).While the overall characterisation f distancesuggests that the most populous category ofreferences is intra-sentential followed byreferences one sentence distant, this pattern isnot true for all pronouns.
While there is nopronoun observed that prefers antecedents attwo or more sentences distant over thoseoccurring within the same sentence, there areanaphors which prefer an antecedent in theprevious sentence over an antecedent in thesame sentence, adding further weight to ourobservation that ignoring inter-sententialanaphora is not an option.
I, me, we, us, youand she prefer an antecedent at one sentencedistance; intra-sentential naphora does notseem to be the norm for these anaphors.In other words, given different pronouns anddifferent circumstances, there are variations inthe behaviour of pronouns.
Although we areonly reporting on one genre here, the work ofBotley (1996) looking at determiners in threegenres, suggest hat genre is another dimensionof variation where we may see significantdifferences in the pattern of distributions ofpronouns across various distance measures.ConclusionThe point of our investigations are toilluminate a variety of features that corpusbased pronoun resolution systems may benefitby, and which they must certainly be aware of:1.
Pronoun antecedents do exhibit clearquantitative patterns of distribution2.
Genre may influence those patterns3.
Direct speech is an important factor inexplaining some of those patterns4.
Inter sentential pronoun resolution isnot always the norm5.
Some patterns of pronoun antecedentdistribution are prone to longer tailsthan others6.
Characterisation of pronoundistributions based on all pronounsdistorts the picture which may beobserved on the individual pronounlevelAn obvious criticism of our work to date is thatwe have not based a pronoun resolution systemupon the data that we have extracted from ourcorpus (although Tanaka, 1998 does include areport on such a system).
The reason we havenot done so, is that we are far from convincedthat the right corpus resources and the right73type of quantitative data are currentlyavailable.
As we produce more and morerefined data from our corpus, we are seeingpatterns of distribution which are masked inmore general representations of the data, as wehave exemplified.
Also, we are only able toproduce this data for a severely limited genreof written texts.
What we need to do next iswork towards a balanced corpus, includingboth written and spoken language, whichwould allow us to extract quantitative datasimilar to that shown in this paper, for a widerange of text types and for spoken language.Our experience to date indicates that while wemay observe patterns of usage which are of useand of importance to robust pronounresolution, that data should at least be extractedon a by genre basis.
