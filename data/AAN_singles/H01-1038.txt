The currentdemonstration illustrates some of the resources that can be madeavailable to analysts tasked with monitoring infectious diseaseoutbreaks and other biological threats.KeywordsTranslation, information extraction, summarization, topicdetection and tracking, system integration.1.
INTRODUCTIONThe long-term goal of TIDES is to provide delivery ofinformation on demand in real-time from live on-line sources.
ForIFE-Bio, the resources made available to the analyst include e-mail, news groups, digital library resources, and eventually (inlater versions), topic-specific segments from broadcast news.Because of the emphasis on global monitoring, there is a need toprocess incoming information in multiple languages.
The systemmust deliver the appropriate information content in theappropriate form and in the appropriate language (taken for nowto be English).
This means that the IFE-Bio system will have todeliver news stories, clusters of relevant documents, threadeddiscussions, alerts on new events, tables, summaries (particularlyover document collections), answers to questions, graphs and geo-spatial  temporal displays of information.The demonstration system for the Human Language TechnologyConference in March 2001 represents an early stage of the fullIFE-Bio system, with an emphasis on end-to-end processing.Future demonstrations will make use of MITRE?s Catalystarchitecture, providing an efficient, scalable architecture tofacilitate  integration of multiple stages of linguistic processing.By June 2001, the IFE-Bio system will provide richer linguisticprocessing through the integration of modules contributed byother TIDES participants.
By June 2002, the IFE-Bio system willinclude additional functionality, such as real-time broadcast newsfeeds, new machine translation components, support for question-answering, cross-language information retrieval, multi-documentsummarization, automatic extraction and normalization oftemporal and spatial information, and automated geospatial andtemporal displays.2.
The IFE-Bio SystemThe current demonstration (March 2001) highlights the basicfunctionality required by an analyst, including:?
Capture of sources, including e-mail, digital librarymaterial, news groups, and web-based resources;?
Categorizing of the sources into multiple orthogonalhierarchies useful to the analyst, e.g., disease, region, newssource, language;?
Processing of the information through various stages,including ?zoning?
of the text to select the relevant portionsfor processing; named entity detection, event detection,extraction of temporal information, summarization, andtranslation from Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese intoEnglish;?
Access to the information through use of any mail and newsgroup reader, which allows the analyst to organize, save, andshare the information in a familiar, readily accessibleenvironment;?
Display of the information in alternate forms, includingcolor-tagged documents, tables, summaries, graphs, andgeospatial, map-based displays.Figure 1 below shows the overall functionality envisionedfor the IFE-Bio system, including capture, categorizing,processing, access and display.Collection capability for the current IFE-Bio system includesemail, news groups, journals, and Web resources.
We have acomplete copy of the ProMED mailings (a moderated sourcetracking global infectious disease outbreaks), and are routinelycollecting other information sources from the World HealthOrganization and CDC.
In addition, we are collecting severalgeneral global news feeds.
Current volume is around 2000messages per day; we estimate capacity for the current system ataround 4500 messages/day.
Once we have integrated a filteringcapability, we expect the volume of messages saved in IFE-Bioshould drop significantly, since many of the global news servicesreport on a wide range of events and not all need to be passed onto IFE-Bio analysts.
The categorizing of sources is done based onthe message header.
The header is synthesized by extracting keyinformation about disease name, the country, and other relevantinformation such as type of victim and source of information, aswell as date of message receipt.The processing for the current demonstration system uses alimited subset of the Catalyst architecture capabilities and anumber of in-house linguistic modules.
The linguistic modules inthe current demonstration system include tokenization, sentencesegmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity detection,temporal extraction (Mani and Wilson 2000) and source-specificevent detection.
In addition, we have incorporated theCyberTrans embedded machine translation system which ?wraps?available machine translation engines to make them available viaan e-mail or Web interface (Reeder 2000).
Single documentsummarization is performed by the MITRE WebSumm system(Mani and Bloedorn 1999).We carefully chose a light-weight interface mechanism fordelivery of the information to the analyst.
By treating theincoming streams of data as feeds to a news server, the analyst caninspect and organize the information using a familiar news and e-mail browser.
The analyst can subscribe to areas of interest, flagimportant messages, watch specific threads, and create tailoredfilters for monitoring outbreaks.
The stories are crossed-posted tomultiple relevant news groups, based on the information in theheader, e.g., a story on Ebola in Africa would be cross posted tothe Africa regional newsgroup and to the Ebola diseasenewsgroup.
Search by subject and date allow the analyst to selectsubsets of the messages for further processing, annotation orsharing.
The news client provides notification of incomingmessages.
In later versions, we plan to integrate topic detectionand tracking capabilities, to provide improved filtering androuting of messages, as well as detection of new topics.
The useof this simple delivery mechanism provides a familiarenvironment with almost no learning curve, and it avoids issues ofplatform and operating system dependence.Finally, the system makes use of several different devices todisplay the information appropriately.

It includes the list ofnewsgroups that have been subscribed to (on the left), the list ofmessages from the chosen newsgroup (on top), and a particularmessage with color-coded named entities (including disease termsdisplayed in red, so that they are easy to spot in the message).What is the status of thecurrent Ebola outbreak?The epidemic is contained;as of 12/22/00, there were421 cases with 162 deathsInteractionCDCWHOMedicalliteratureEmail:ProMed~ 2500stories/dayInternlNewsSources  CaptureTranslingualInformationDetectionExtractionSummarizationU niden tif ied h emor rhagic  fU niden tif ied h emor rhagic  fEbola hemorr hagic  fever  inRe :  Ebo la hemorrhagi.

The message inFigure 2 contains a short tabular display in the beginning,identifying disease, region and victim type.
Below that is a URLto a document summary, created by MITRE?s WebSumm system(see Figure 3 for a sample summary).
If an incoming message isin a language other than English, then CyberTrans is called to runcode set and language identification modules, and the language istranslated into English for further processing.
Figure 4 belowshows a sample translated message; note that there are a numberof untranslated words, but it is still possible to get the gist of themessage.In addition, we are working on a mechanism to providegeographic and eventually, temporal display of outbreakinformation.
Figure 5 shows the stages of processing involved.Stage 1 shows onamed entity and temporal tagging to identify theitems of interest.
These are combined into disease events byfurther linguistic processing; the result is shown in the table inStage 2.
This spreadsheet of events serves as input for a map-based display, shown in Stage 3.
The graph plots number of newcases and number of cumulative cases over time.
In the map, thesize of the outer dot represents total number of cases to date, andthe inner dot represents new cases.
This allows the analyst tovisualize spread of the disease, as well as the stage of the outbreak(spreading or subsiding).3.
