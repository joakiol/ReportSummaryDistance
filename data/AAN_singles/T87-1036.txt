METAPHOR:Dedre GentnerPsychology DepartmentTHE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY tBrian Falkenhainer* Janice Skorstad**Computer Science Computer ScienceUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignMetaphor is a pervasive and important phenomenon, both in literature and in ordinary language.
It is also animmensely variable phenomenon.
The term 'metaphor' is often used to refer to nonliteral comparisons thatare novel and vivid and that convey ideas that might otherwise be difficult to express (Ortony, 1975).
But theterm has also been used to refer to systems of extended meanings that are so familiar as to be almostinvisible, such as the spatial metaphors 'soaring spirits' or 'falling GNP' (Lakoff & Johnson, 1979; Nagy,1974).
Even if we restrict ourselves to literary metaphors, there is still an enormous range of metaphor types,as shown in the following list:1.
She allowed life to waste like a tap left running (Virginia Wolfe).2.
I have ventured,/Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,/This many summers in a sea ofglory;/But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride/At length broke under me; and now has leftme,/Weary and old with service, to the mercy/Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.(ShakesPeare)3.
For the black bat, night, has flown (Tennyson)4.
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun (Robert Herrick)5.
On a star of faith pure as the drifting bread,/As the food and flames of the snow (Dylan Thomas)6. the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses (Cummings)Perhaps because of this staggering variety, there is little consensus on how metaphor should be definedand analyzed.
Most would agree that metaphors are nonliteral similarity comparisons (though not everyonewould agree on how literality should be defined), and that they are typically used for expressive-affective asopposed to explanatory-predictive purposes.
But beyond this, metaphor has remained elusive of analysis.In this paper we offer a partial solution.
We use Gentner's (1980, 1983, 1986) structure-mapping frameworkto distinguish three classes of metaphors - -  two that are computationally tractable within the framework andone that is not.
Then we demonstrate how the analysis works, using the Structure-mapping Engine, asimulation written by Brian Falkenhainer and Ken Forbus (Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1986).This research was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research under Contract No.

We mean 'ugly' here in the sense of 'computationally intractable.'
We use 'metaphor' here to refer to bothmetaphor and simile.176The basic intuition of structure-mapping theory is that an analogy is a mapping of knowledge from onedomain (the base) into another (the target) which conveys that a system of relations that holds among thebase objects also holds among the target objects.
Thus an analogy is a way of noticing relationalcommonalties independently of the objects in which those relations are embedded.
In interpreting ananalogy, people seek to put the objects of the base in 1-to-1 correspondence with the objects of the targetso as to obtain maximum structural match.
The corresponding objects in the base and target don't have toresemble each other at all; object correspondences are determined by roles in the matching relationalstructures.
Central to the mapping process is the principle of systematicity: people prefer to map systemsof predicates that contain higher-order elations with inferential import, rather than to map isolated predicates.
~The systematicity principle is a structural expression of our tacit preference for coherence and deductivepower in interpreting analogy.Besides analogy, other kinds of similarity matches can be distinguished in this framework, according towhether the match is one of relational structure, object descriptions, or both.
Recall that analogies discardobject descriptions and map relational structure.
Mere-appearance matches are the opposite: they mapaspects of object descriptions and discard relational structure.
Literal similarity matches map both relationalstructure and object-descriptions.Kinds of Metaphors: Now let us apply this framework to metaphor.
We can distinguish three roughcategories of metaphors: relational metaphors, attributional metalShors, and complex metaphors that cannotbe simply analyzed.
Relational metaphors - -  e.g., metaphors (1) and (2) -:- are mappings of relationalstructure.
They can be analyzed like analogies.
Attributional metaphors - -  e.g., metaphors (3) and (4) m aremere-appearance matches: their focus is on common object attributes.
Among these two classes, adults(but not children) seem to prefer relational metaphors (Gentner, 1980; 1986).
So far both these classes canreadily be described in structure-mapping terms: both utilize 1-to-1 object mappings and are characterizableby their distribution of relational and attributional predicates.
The third class, which we will not attempt toanalyze, is exemplified by metaphors (5) and (6).
These metaphors lack clear 1-to-1 mappings; they arecharacterized many cross-weaving connections with no clear way of deciding exactly how the basepredicates should attach in the target (See Gentner, 1982).To illustrate the way in which relational metaphors can be analyzed, we now describe the operation of SMEon metaphor (1): She allowed life to waste like a tap left running.The representations for base and target are shown in Figure 1.
We assume the reader starts off with somenotion of water flowing through a tap into a drain, and with the idea that waste occurs if an agent allows such aflow to occur with no purpose.
In the target domain of life it is less clear exactly what to assume as initialknowledge.
In this example we have chosen a rather sparse description.
We assume that the reader has the177idea that life flows from present to past.
Since the information that the protagonist's life is being wasted isgiven directly, we also include that knowledge in the initial life representation.Wasted-Tap-WaterLEADS-TOCAUSE AND WASTEb,,FLOW DISAPPEARS PURPOSE p0 waterwater tap drain water drain FLOW p0 none?

Wasted-Tap-Water and Wasted-Life DescriptionsSME starts by finding local matches m potential matches between single items in the base and target.
Foreach entity and predicate in the base, it finds the set of entities or predicates in the target that could plausiblymatch that item.
These potential correspondences (match hypotheses) are determined by a set of simplerules: 2(1) If two relations have the same namel create a match hypothesis;(2) For every match hypothesis between relations, check their corresponding arguments: if bothare entities, or if both are functions, then create a match hypothesis between them.Here, rule (1) creates match hypotheses between the FLOW relations which occur in base and target.
Thenrule (2) creates match hypotheses between their arguments: water-life, tap-present, drain-past At this stagethe program may have a large number of local matches, possibly mutually inconsistent.
Another set of rulesassigns evidence scores to these local matches:(1)(2)Increase the evidence for a match if the base and target predicate have the same name.Increase the evidence for a given match if there is evidence for a match among the parentrelations m i.e., the immediately governing higher-order elations.Rule (1) reflects a preference for relational identity and rule (2) reflects a preference for systematicity.
Here,match between the FLOW predicates discussed above gains evidence from the identicality of the FLOWpredicates themselves (by evidence rule (1)) and also from the identicality of the parent CAUSE relations (byevidence rule (2))..
This description is for analogy.
SME can also be run with different match rules to simulate mere-appearancematches and literal similarity matches.178The next stage is to collect these local matches into g loba l  matches  m systems of matches that useconsistent entity-pairings.
SME propagates entity-correspondences upward and finds the largest possiblesystems of matched predicates with consistent object-mappings.
These global matches, called Gmaps, arethe possible interpretations of the analogy.
Figure 2a shows the Gmap for the life/water example.
3Associated with each Gmap is a (possibly empty) set of cand idate  in fe rences  ~ predicates that are part of thebase system but were not initially present in the corresponding target system.
These will be hypothesized tobe true in the target system.
In this case, the system brings across the inference that the protagonist isletting her life pass with no purpose, and that this purposeless flow is causing her life to be wasted.
Finally,each Gmap is given a structural evaluation, which depends on its local match evidence.
4SME can also operate in mere-appearance mode to process attributional metaphors.
Figure 2b shows theinterpretation that metaphor (1) receives under these matching rules.
Clearly the relational interpretation ispreferable in this case.Gmap #1: { (WASTE ,-~ WASTE ) (FLOW ,-~ FLOW) (DISAPPEARS ~ DISAPPEARS)(CAUSE ~ CAUSE) (p0 ~ she) (tap ,-~ present) (water ~ life) (drain ,-~ past) }Weight: 6.7018Candidate Inferences: { (LEADS-TO (AND (DISAPPEARS life past)(PURPOSE (FLOW life present past) she none))(WASTE she life)) }(a)Gmap #1: { (VALUABLEB1 ~-) VALUABLET2 ) (water ~ present)Weight: 0.9500Candidate Inferences: { }Gmap #2: { (VALUABLEB1 ~ VALUABLET1 ) (water ,-~ life)Weight: 0.9500Candidate Inferences: { }(b)Figure 2.
(a) Analogy Match Rules, (b) Mere Appearance Match RulesComments: A few points about the simulation model should be noted.
First, SME's interpretations areextremely sensitive to the knowledge representations of base and target.
We think this roughly reflects thestate of affairs in human processing of analogy and metaphor.
Second, SME's matching process is entirely3.
Because of the sparseness of the representations, only one Gmap is discovered.
When we run this example withricher representations, adding such potentially confusing information as "Life consumes water."
in the life domain,we find more Gmaps, although the highest evaluation still goes to the Gmap shown here.4.
The system also has the capability to consider the number of candidate inferences and the graph-theoreticstructure in determining the evaluation, but their ramifications need to be explored.
It is interesting that the simpleversion of systematicity embodied in the local evidence rules seems to lead to very reasonable interpretations.179structural.
SME arrives at its interpretation by finding the most systematic mappable structure consistent withthe 1-to-1 mapping rule.
The reason that relatively interesting interpretations are found is that thesystematicity principle operates to promote predicates that participate in causal chains and in otherconstraining relations.
Unlike some current models of analogy (e.g., Holyoak, 1985), structure-mappingdoes not need to use a prior goal-structure to select its interpretation.
5 This makes it particularly apt for theinterpretation of novel metaphors, in which we may have no advance knowledge of the content of theinterpretation.In conclusion, structure-mapping can handle the good and the bad - -  ie., either relational or attributionalmappings that are 1-to-1.
Whether it can handle the ugly m the complex n-to-1 mappings - -  remains to beseen.Acknowledgements" The authors wish to thank Ken Forbus for his invaluable assistance.References :Burstein, M. H. (1983).
