Proceedings of the ACL-HLT 2011 Student Session, pages 52?57,Portland, OR, USA 19-24 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsPsychoSentiWordNetAmitava DasDepartment of Computer Science and EngineeringJadavpur Universityamitava.santu@gmail.comAbstractSentiment analysis is one of the hotdemanding research areas since last fewdecades.
Although a formidable amount ofresearch has been done but still the existingreported solutions or available systems arefar from perfect or to meet the satisfactionlevel of end user's.
The main issue may bethere are many conceptual rules that governsentiment, and there are even more clues(possibly unlimited) that can convey theseconcepts from realization to verbalizationof a human being.
Human psychologydirectly relates to the unrevealed clues;govern the sentiment realization of us.Human psychology relates many thingslike social psychology, culture, pragmaticsand many more endless intelligent aspectsof civilization.
Proper incorporation ofhuman psychology into computationalsentiment knowledge representation maysolve the problem.
PsychoSentiWordNet isan extension over SentiWordNet that holdshuman psychological knowledge andsentiment knowledge simultaneously.1 IntroductionIn order to identify sentiment from a text, lexicalanalysis plays a crucial role.
For example, wordslike love, hate, good and favorite directly indicatesentiment or opinion.
Various previous works(Pang et al, 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006;Baccianella et.
al., 2010) have already proposedtechniques for making dictionaries for thosesentiment words.
But polarity assignment of suchsentiment lexicons is a hard semanticdisambiguation problem.
The regulating aspectswhich govern the lexical level semantic orientationare natural language context (Pang et al, 2002),language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006),domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon,2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors andculture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and manymore unrevealed hidden aspects.
Therefore it is achallenging and enigmatic research problem.What previous studies proposed is to attach priorpolarity to each sentiment lexicon level.
Priorpolarity is an approximation value based on corpusheuristics based statistics and not exact.
Theprobabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores donot solve the problem completely rather it shovesthe problem into next level, called contextualpolarity classification.The hypothesis we started with is that thesummation of all the regulating aspects ofsentiment orientation is human psychology andthus it is called multi-faceted problem (Liu, 2010).More precisely what we meant by humanpsychology is the all known and unknown aspects,directly or indirectly govern the sentimentorientation knowledge of us.
The regulatingaspects wrapped in the presentPsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, City,Country, Language and Profession.The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension overthe existing SentiWordNet to hold the possiblepsychological ingredients, governs the sentimentunderstandability of us.
The PsychoSentiWordNetholds variable prior polarity scores, could befetched depending upon those psychologicalregulating aspects.
An example may illustrate thedefinition better for the concept ?Rock_Climbing?
:Aspects (Age)  Polarity-----------------------------  -------------Null   Positive50-54   Negative26-29   Positive52In the previous example the described concept?Rock_Climbing?
is generally positive as it isadventurous and people have it to make fun orexcursion.
But it demands highly physical abilitythus may be not as good for aged people like theyounger people.PsychoSentiWordNet provides good coverage asit an extension over SentiWordNet 3.0(Baccianella et.
al., 2010).
In this paper, wepropose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment)technology to collect psycho-sentimental polarityfor lexicons.In this section we have philosophically arguedabout the necessity of developingPsychoSentiWordNet.
In the next section we willdescribe about the technical proposed architecturefor building the lexical resource.
Section 3 explainsabout some exciting outcomes that support theusefulness of the PsychoSentiWordNet.
What webelieve is the developed PsychoSentiWordNet willhelp automatic sentiment analysis research in manyaspect and other disciplines as well, described inthe section 4.The data structure and organization isdescribed in section 5 and finally the present paperconcluded with section 6.2 Dr SentimentDr Sentiment 1  is a template based interactiveonline game, which collects player?s sentiment byasking a set of simple template based questions andfinally reveals a player?s sentimental status.
DrSentiment fetches random words fromSentiWordNet synsets and asks every player to tellabout his/her sentiment polarity understandingregarding the concept behind.There are several motivations behind developingan intuitive game to automatically collect humanpsycho-sentimental orientation information.In the history of Information Retrieval researchthere is a milestone when ESP game2 (Ahn et al,2004) innovate the concept of a game toautomatically label images available in the WorldWide Web.
It has been identified as the mostreliable strategy to automatically annotate theonline images.
We are highly motivated by thesuccess of the Image Labeler game.A number of research endeavors could be foundin literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon in1http://www.amitavadas.com/Sentiment%20Game/2http://www.espgame.org/several languages and domains.
These techniquescan be broadly categorized in two genres, onefollows classical manual annotation (Andreevskaiaand Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Riloff, 2006);(Mohammad et al, 2008) techniques and the othersproposed various automatic techniques (Tong,2001).
Both types of techniques have fewlimitations.
Manual annotation techniques areundoubtedly trustable but it generally takes time.Automatic techniques demands manual validationsand are dependent on the corpus availability in therespective domain.
Manual annotation techniquerequired a large number of annotators to balanceone?s sentimentality in order to reach agreement.But human annotators are quite unavailable andcostly.But sentiment is a property of humanintelligence and is not entirely based on thefeatures of a language.
Thus people?s involvementis required to capture the sentiment of the humansociety.
We have developed an online game toattract internet population for the creation ofPsychoSentiWordNet automatically.
Involvementof Internet population is an effective approach asthe population is very high in number and evergrowing (approx.
360,985,492) 3 .
Internetpopulation consists of people with variouslanguages, cultures, age etc and thus not biasedtowards any domain, language or particularsociety.
The Sign Up form of the ?Dr Sentiment?game asks the player to provide personalinformation such as Sex, Age, City, Country,Language and Profession.The lexicons tagged by this system are credibleas it is tagged by human beings.
In either way it isnot like a static sentiment lexicon set as it isupdated regularly.
Almost 100 players per day arecurrently playing it throughout the world indifferent languages.The game has four types of question templates.For further detailed description the questiontemplates are named as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Tomake the gaming interface more interesting imageshas been added with the help of Google imagesearch API 4  and to avoid biasness we haverandomized among the first ten images retrievedby Google.
Snapshots of different screens from thegame are presented in Figure 1.3http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm4http://code.google.com/apis/imagesearch/53Figure 1: Snapshots from Dr Sentiment Game2.1 Gaming StrategyThere are four types of questions: Q1, Q2, Q3 andQ4.
Dr Sentiment asks 30 questions to eachplayer.There are predefined distributions of eachquestion type as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and4 for Q4.
There is no thumb rule behind thecardinals rather they are arbitrarily chosen andrandomly changed for experimentation.
Thequestions are randomly asked to keep the gamemore interesting.2.2 Q1An English word from the English SentiWordNetsynset is randomly chosen.
The Google imagesearch API is fired with the word as a query.
Animage along with the word itself is shown in theQ1 page of the game.Players press the different emoticons (Fig 2) toexpress their sentimentality.
The interface keepslog records of each interaction.ExtremePositive Positive Neutral NegativeExtremeNegativeFigure 2: Emoticons to Express Player?sSentiment2.3 Q2This question type is specially designed for relativescoring technique.
For example: good and betterboth are positive but we need to know which one ismore positive than other.
Table 1 shows how inSentiWordNet relative scoring has been made.With the present gaming technology relativepolarity scoring has been assigned to each n-nword pair combination.Now about the technical solution how we did it.Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have beenchosen from the source SentiWordNet synsetsalong with their images as retrieved by GoogleAPI.
Each player is then asked to select one ofthem that he/she likes most.
The relative score iscalculated and stored in the corresponding log logtable.Word Positivity NegativityGood 0.625 0.0Better 0.875 0.0Best 0.980 0.0Table 1: Relative Sentiment Scores fromSentiWordNet2.4 Q3The player is asked for any positive word in his/hermind.
This technique helps to increase thecoverage of existing SentiWordNet.
The word isthen added to the PsychoSentiWordNet and furtherused in Q1 to other users to note theirsentimentality about the particular word.2.5 Q4A player is asked by Dr Sentiment about anynegative word.
The word is then added to thePsychoSentiWordNet and further used in Q1 to54other users to note their sentimentality about theparticular word.2.6 Comment ArchitectureThere are three types of Comments, Comment type1 (CMNT1), Comment type 2 (CMNT2) and thefinal comment as Dr Sentiment?s prescription.CMNT1 type and CMNT2 type comments areassociated with question types Q1 and Q2respectively.2.7 CMNT1Comment type 1 has 5 variations as shown in theComment table in Table 3.
Comments arerandomly retrieved from comment type tableaccording to their category.?
Positive word has been tagged as negative (PN)?
Positive word has been tagged as positive (PP)?
Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP)?
Negative word has been tagged as negative (NN)?
Neutral (NU)2.8 CMNT2The strategy here is as same as the CMNT 1.Comment type 2 has only 2 variations as.?
Positive word has been tagged as negative.
(PN)?
Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP)2.9 Dr Sentiment?s PrescriptionThe final prescription depends on various factorssuch as total number of positive, negative orneutral comments and the total time taken by anyplayer.
The final prescription also depends on therange of the values of accumulating all the abovefactors.This is only the appealing factor to a player.
Theprovoking message for players is Dr Sentiment canreveal their sentimental status: whether they areextreme negative or positive or very much neutralor diplomatic etc.
A word previously tagged by aplayer is avoided by the tracking system for thenext time playing as our intension is to tag moreand more words involving Internet population.
Weobserve that the strategy helps to keep the gameinteresting as a large number of players return toplay the game after this strategy was implemented.We are not demanding that the revealed status ofa player by Dr Sentiment is exact or ideal.
It isonly to make fun but the outcomes of the gameeffectively help to store human sentimentalpsychology in terms of computational lexicon.3 Senti-MentalityPsychoSentiWordNet gives a good sketch tounderstand the psycho-sentimental behavior ofsociety depending upon proposed psychologicaldimensions.
The PsychoSentiWordNet is basicallythe log records of every player?s tagged words.3.1 Concept-Culture-Wise AnalysisFigure 3: Geospatial Senti-MentalityThe word ?blue?
get tagged by different playersaround the world.
But surprisingly it has beentagged as positive from one part of the world andnegative from another part of the world.
Thegraphical illustration in Figure 3 explains thesituation.
The observation is that most of thenegative tags are coming from the middle-east andespecially from the Islamic countries.
We found aline in Wiki5 (see in Religion Section) that maygive a good explanation: ?Blue in Islam: In verse20:102 of the Qur?an, the word ???
zurq (plural ofazraq 'blue') is used metaphorically for evil doerswhose eyes are glazed with fear?.
But otherexplanations may be there for this.
This is aninteresting observation that supports theeffectiveness of PsychoSentiWordNet.
Thisinformation could be further retrieved from thedeveloped source by giving information like (blue,Italy), (blue, Iraq) or (blue, USA) etc.3.2 Age-Wise AnalysisAnother interesting observation is thatsentimentality may vary age-wise.
For betterunderstanding we look at the total statistics and the5http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue55age wise distribution of all the players.
Total 533players have taken part till date.
The total numberof players for each range of age is shown at top ofevery bar.
In the Figure 4 the horizontal bars aredivided into two colors (Green depicts thePositivity and Red depicts the negativity)according to the total positivity and negativityscores, gathered during playing.
This sociologicalstudy gives an idea that variation of sentimentalitywith age.
This information could be furtherretrieved from the developed source by givinginformation like (X, 36-39) or (X, 45-49) etc.Figure 4: Age-Wise Senti-Mentality3.3 Gender SpecificIt is observed from the statistics collected thatwomen are more positive than a man.
Thevariations in sentimentality among men andwomen are shown in the following Figure 5.Figure 5: Gender Specific Senti-Mentality3.4 Other-WiseWe have described several important observationsin the previous sections and there are otherimportant observations as well.
Studies on thecombinations of the proposed psychologicaldimensions, such as, location-age, location-profession and gender-location may reveal someinteresting results.4 Expected Impact of the ResourceUndoubtedly the generated PsychoSentiWordNetare important resource for sentiment/opinion oremotion analysis task.
Moreover the other nonlinguistic psychological dimensions are very muchimportant for further analysis and in several newlydiscovered sub-disciplines such as: GeospatialInformation retrieval (Egenhofer, 2002),Personalized search (Gaucha et al, 2003) andRecommender System (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin,2005) etc.5 The Data Structure and OrganizationDeciding about the data structure of this kind ofspecial requirement was not trivial.
PresentlyRDBMS (Relational Database ManagementSystem) has been used.
Several tables are beingused to keep user?s clicking log and their personalinformation.As one of the research motivations was togenerate up-to-date prior polarity scores thus wedecided to generate web service API by that peoplecould access latest prior polarity scores.
We dobelieve this method will over perform than a staticsentiment lexicon set.6 Conclusion & Future DirectionIn the present paper the development of thePsychoSentiWordNet has been described.
Noevaluation has been done yet as there is no dataavailable for this kind of experimentation and tothe best of our knowledge this is the first endeavorwhere sentiment meets psychology.Our present goal is to collect such corpus andexperiment to check whether variable prior polarityscore of PsychoSentiWordNet excel over the fixedpoint prior polarity score of SentiWordNet.AcknowledgmentsThe work reported in this paper was supported by agrant from the India-Japan Cooperative Program(DST-JST) 2009 Research project entitled?Sentiment Analysis where AI meets Psychology?funded by Department of Science and Technology(DST), Government of India.56ReferencesAndreevskaia Alina and Bergler Sabine.
