Organizing linguistic knowledgefor multilingual generation*Martin Emele, Ulrich Held, Stefan Momma, Rdmi ZajacProject PolyglossUniversity of StuttgartIMS-CL/IfI-AIS, KeplerstraBe 17,D 7000 Stuttgart 1, Federal Republic of Germanyemaih p01ygloss@informatik.uni-stuttgart.dbp.deAbstractWe propose an architecture for the organisation oflinguistic knowledge which allows to (1) separatelyformulate generalizations for different ypes of lin-guistic information, and (2) state interrelations be-tween partial information belonging to different lev-els of description.
We use typed feature structuresfor encoding linguistic knowledge.
We show the ap-plication of this representational device for the archi-tecture of linguistic knowledge sources for nmltilin-gum generation.
As an example, we describe the useof interacting collocational nd syntactic onstraintsin the generation of French and German sentences.1 In t roduct ion1.1 The Prob lemThe choice of target language realizations in ma-chine translation or in multilingual generation is con-ditioned by constraints involving different levels oflinguistic description for the individual anguages.From a descriptive point of view, it is desirable tobe able to keep these different levels separate - con-ceptually ~ well ~s in the actual implementation fknowledge sources and representations of linguisticobjects; such levels may include, for example, a de-scription of morphological properties, of constituentstructure, of predicate-argument structures or func-tional structures, as well as a description of textualand pragmatic properties.In generation from semantic representations, con-straints on the choice of linguistic realizations de-pend on properties of the basic elements of lexicaland syntactic variants with respect o all these lev-els; such constraints usually interact in various ways.Knowledge sources which provide the informa-tion necessary for modelling such phenomena shouldtherefore allow for modularization as well as for*Reseoxch reported in this paper is partly supported bythe Gelanan Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT,Bundesminister ffir Forschung und Technologic), under grantNo.

Usually, adjacent levels are connected by ex-plicit mappings.
Conditions acting on nonadjacentlevels often cannot be expressed irectly: thus, in-formation has to be carried explicitly across levelswhere it would normally not be stated.
Moreover, asthe input structure is transformed stepwise, the setof mappings has to be ordered carefully.
Other gen-eration researchers, like \[DANLOS 1987\]:96-99 and\[NIRENBUtlG 1989\]:242f have a similar view of thearchitecture of the linguistic description; most oftheir solutions to the above problem are based on aheuristic ordering of the mapping and on some lossof strictness in the separation of levels.In order to alleviate such problems, the use of"codescriptions" h~u been proposed 1 which allowsfor statements about the coexistence of partial de-scriptions belonging to separate descriptive levels.This device makes all relevant information avait~able in one place thus allowing for constraints fromdifferent levels to be considered at the same time.Although the use of codescriptions perfectly sup-ports the formulation of interactions between differ-ent types of partial information, the current propos-1See.

1989\], where f-structures for different lan-guages are simtdtm~eously built up.102 1als do not seem to pay enough attention to the sep-aration <)f different types of information.
In manycases, one of the types of information is assigneda predominant role (usually this is c-structure); allother information depends on it, i.e.
cannot be ex-pressed without making reference to the dominatinginformation.In this paper we propose an architecture of knowl-edge sources for multilingual genera.tion.
It is basedon linguistic descriptions in the format of typed fea-ture terms following ideas of \[Ai'T-KAcI 1986\].
Thisallows, much like object-oriented systems, for a mod-ularization of knowledge; we can state relations cap-turing interdependencies between elements of differ-ent des('riptive l vels without losing the possibility toindependently formulate generalizations fbr classesof linguistic Objects.2 Architecture2.1 The  representat iona l  device: typed  fea-tu re  terrasThe objects used to represent partial linguistic infor-mation are typed feature  terms:  i.e.
feature termswhere each node in the directed graph usually repre--smiting an ordinary feature term can be associatedwith a type symbol.
For type'symbois, the linguistsupplies a. feature type definition which can be a fea-ture term, a feature term with conditions (used toexpress additional constraints), or a conjmlction ordisjunction of feature terms.The system we have implemented compiles a set offeature type definitions, a feature type system, into ahierarchy of feature terms which is derived from thehierarchy of type symbols (iniplicitly defined by theset of feature type definitions) and the usual sub-sumption relation on ordinary feature terms.
In thegeneral case, the hierarchy of feature terms is a mul-tiple inheritance hierarchy.
(riven an arbitrary linguistic object representedby a feature term which is only partially specified,the linguist is interested in obtaining the most pre-cise description of this object according to a gram-mar (specified as a feature type system).
Given sucha term, the interpreter computes the set of mostspecific feature terms which are deriw~d from it byapplying feature type definitions: each member ofthe solution set is subsumed by (i.e.
is more specificthan) the initial term.
For tiffs derivation, the inter-prefer of' the system uses only two basic operations ~,typed un i f icat ion of feature terms, and rewr i t ingba~sed on unifying substitutions of feature terms.7A l i iore detailed description of these operations can befound in \[F\]MELb~/ZAJAC 1990^\]"OBJECT'"PROPOSITION"'EVENT" "STATE"'I-ARG-EVENT" "2-ARG-EVgNT" "3-A RG--EV ENT" / \"F, NCOUNTER" "DELAY"'~NTITY'"PROJECT' "TEAM" 'PROBLEM'Figure 1: A part of the conceptual hierarchy2.2 L inguist ic  Ob jectsDescriptions of linguistic objects may contain prag-matic, semantic, and syntactic information.
We o fganize tile linguistic information as a hierarchy ofclasses of linguistic objects, where we assume thatfor each of the levels, it is possible to define classesof basic objects, classes of structures these objectscan be parts of, and interrelations between objectsof different levels and between structures of diflbrentlevels 3.For example, basic objects of a conceptual de-scription are concepts, those of a lexical descriptionare lezical units (words as well as multi word lex-emes).
Semantic structures may, for example, definethe temporal structuring of states of affairs; syntac=tic structures define well-formed phrase structuresand functional structures.
Relations between con-cepts and lexemes define possible ways of lexicalizingconceptual information in a given language.
Rela-tions between semantic and syntactic structures de-scribe possible syntactic realizations of semantic de:scriptions.For the remainder of this paper, we isolate thepart of the architecture concerned with the relationsbetween conceptual and syntactic descriptions, ab-stracting away from other types of information.3 Relating conceptual and syntacticknowledge3.1 A conceptua l  h ie rarchyFigure 3.1 shows a simplified version of the upperpart of a hierarchy of concepts.
It distinguishes be-tween entities and propositions (events, states etc.
),the latter being subclassified according to their num-ber of arguments.
The lower parts of the hierarchy(not shown in the figure), may contain domain spe-3Our semantic description is largely based on work in Dis-course \]{eprcsentatlon Theory \[KAMP/I\[EYbE 1990\]; the syn-tactic representation follows the lines of Lexical I"unctlonal(J r l t in  I110it2103cific concept classifications.
As to the level of de-tail down to which the conceptual description pro-ceeds, it seems useful to stop decomposing conceptsat a level where none of the languages to be treatedhas more specialized lexemes available.
This allowsto treat cases where languages differ with respectto the specialization level down to which they havelexemes.
French and Italian, for example, do nothave lexemes for the concept of "transport-in-the-ai(',which makes it necessary to use the lexeme denot-ing a generic *transport*-action and to separatelyrealize (in a prepositional phrase) the instrument:transporter des fleurs en avion de Nice a Berlin;trasportare fiori in aereo, da Nizza a Berlino.
En-glish and German, on the other hand, not only havelexemes for the generic oncept, but also for the spe-cialized one, namely lo fly slh.
and etw.
ftiegen, as infly flowers from Nice to Berlin; Blumen yon Nizzanach Berlin fliegen.
We therefore introduce a con-cept *fly*, defined as a subclass of *transport* with*airplane* as an instrument.3.2 A lexical h ie rarchyIn analogy to the semantic lassification, we intro-duce a hierarchy of syntactic objects classified ac-cording to their syntagmatic properties; this allowsfor immediate access to information relevant for therealization of each lexeme.We use a hierarchy of subcategorization typeswhere "monosemous readings" of lexical units areclassified.
As an example, we discuss some charac-teristics of the organization of the French verbalsubcategorization hierarchy.
Although basically us-ing fnnctional structures of LFG as syntactic rep-resentations, we do not only use LFG's grammati-cal function labels as a basic vocabulary 4.
We alsospecify, among others, the phrasal category of thecomplement (NP, AP, finite or infinite clause, etc.
),pronominalization possibilities (e.g.
le, la, lee vs.en, y vs. lui, lent, etc.
), and the presence/absenceof prepositions.
This decomposes grammatical ftmc-tions according to the distinctions relevant fortheir definition.
Similar procedures have been pro-posed within LFG's lexical mapping theory, e.g.by \[\]3RESNAN/KANEKVA 1989\].
Our representationwould also allow, without major changes, the con-struction of syntactic representations in the formatof a different unification-based grammatical theory,if this theory makes use of the same types of elemen-tary distinctions as the classification used here.This double classification which uses categorial as4E.g., grammatical functions may be assigned to com-plements with different internal structure (e.g.
NPs or sub-clauses, described as (OBJ)ects).well as pronominalization information, allows for theindependent formulation of generalizations coded inthe definition of the respective subcategorizationclasses; for each pronominalization type, includingpredicative and oblique complements, a range of pos-sible syntactic realizations is described.
For each"monosemous reading" of a verbal lexeme we canthus describe in detail a set of synonymous syntac-tic construction variants.The lexical entry for enthousiasmer specifes, for ex-ample, that both its complements may only be real-ized as NPs:(1 )  enthousiasmer =rPRED: "enthousiasmer" 12-f-verb /1ST-COMPL: subj A nominal-phrase I .L2ND-eOMPL: obj A nominal-phrase.Jenthousiasmer inherits from the class 2-f-verb ofverbs taking two complements and selects as a firstcomplement a nominal phrase of type subj, and asa second complement an NP of type obj.
subj repre-sents the whole range of possible structures whichcan appear as first complements; obj also defines aset of realization variants with the same pronomi-nalization behaviour, namely an NP, affirmative orinterrogative clause or infinitivals with or without aor de as a preposition.
(2) 2-f-verb ="IsT-COMPL: subj J )   obj v iobj v 1verb-class ~ND-COMPL: ~en-obj V y-obj V .
"l, predi V obl(3) subj = nominative A({ nominal-phrase V affirmative V infinite}).3.3 Re la t ing  conceptua l  and syntact icknowledge3.3.1 Types  of  re la t ionsFrom what we said about semantic decompositionabove, it follows that, for each concept, we assumethere exists at least one lexeme in one of the lan-guages; usually there will be more than one.
Thisis captured by a relation p on pairs of partial se-mantic and partial syntactic structures.
The relationis specified as a feature term with top level labelsSEM and SYN.
The fact that many of the interac-tions between semantic and syntactic de,~criptionscan be expressed for whole classes of structures isreflected by a modular and hierarchical specifica-tion of this relation.
For example, there is a relationp-entity~NP which connects objects of type *entity*with noun phrases, or the relations p-proposition ~NPand p-proposition,-.VP which relate *proposition* type104 3objects with NPs (whose head is a nominalization)or VPs (e.g.
infinitival complements, that-clauses,etc.
), re.,~pectively.Since verbs are classified according to their num-ber of complements, it is possible to define relationsbetween predicates and lexical classes, e.g.
for predi-cates with two arguments and their two-place lexicalcounterparts (p-2arg).On the lexical level, relations between conceptsand lexemes allow for the specification of lexical ma-terial (single lexemes, as well as e.g.
support verbconstructions etc.)
available for a given concept; thelexical types represent a range of construction vari~ants which can be formed with the lemma.
So, forexample  p~enthuse relates the concept *enthuse* withthe verbal emlna enthousiasmer discussed in (l).
Theconcept *enthuse* is defined as taking a *proposit ion*as its first ~trgnment.
The lemnm enthousiasrner, how-ever, selects only nominal-phrase type first comple-ments.
Consequently, subject clauses or subject in-finitives are ruled out for this verb, and among therealization possibilities for *proposition*s, only nomi-nalizations can be used.3.3.2 Using the re lat ions in generat ionThe use of the architecture of knowledge sources fordifferent descriptive levels is best shown in an ap-plication where the interaction of constraints fromdifferent levels has to be treated: in the followingexample, collocational nd syntactic (subcategoriza-tion) constraints interact.For the realization of a simplified conceptual struc-ture like (4), different English, French and Germancollocations such as (5)--(11) can  be used;(4) *ENCOUNTER* \[ARG2: *PROBLEM*Jsuch  as:(5) .t;,': the team encounlers a problem;(6) E: the leaT~ comes across a problem;(7) F: le troupe rencontre uu probldme;(8) F: le troupe bule eonlre un probl~me;(9) F: le troupe se heurle hun  probl~me;(10) G: das Team st&l auf ein Problem;(1.1) G: das Team lrifft auf ein Problem.The verbs used in (5) to (11) are collocationallyp~:eferred.The following statements relate the concept*encounter* with French and German lexemes, im-plicitly keeping track of the colloeational restrictionsby listing only the possible collocates of problem andProblem, respectively:(12) p-f-ll ::SYN: {rencontre, V buter V se_heurter}J"(13) p~tg-ll :=SYN : s tossen .zu fA simplified subcategorization description for theFrench and German verbs shows that they fallroughly into two classes, transitive and intransitive'~:French renconlrer (7) is described as transitive, tak-ing a subject and an object and being passivizable.French buter contre (8) and se heu,'ter a (9), a.~ wellas German s toflen auf or lreffen auf (lO), (11), aredescribed as taking a subject and a prepositional ob-ject, and disallowing passivization:(16)  rencontrer ={S-O-V V s-by-v} \[PRED: "rencontrer"\] .
(17) buter =\[PR.ED : "buter" \]s-p-v teoBJ :  \ [PcAsE:"co, , t~e"\]  "(18)  se_heurter ~-\[PRED:"se_heurter" \]s-p-v LPOBJ: \[PEASE: "a"\]J "(19)  stossen~uf =\[PRED : "stossen" \]s-P-VkPOBj: \[PCASg:"auff\] "The problem is that collocationally correct realiza-tions of (4) in German are only possible with verbswhich do not have passive forms, like sloflen auf orIre\]fen auf (lO), (11).If we want to generate French and German fi'om apredicate-argument structure like (19), we still wantto use a general relation describing the relation be-tween a I{ESTR.

This relation carries the constraint,however, that the verb which the participle is to bederived from be transitive.

wlfere the collocate is a transitive verb, onlyan active relative clause with an impersonal subject(man) is possible for (19):(25) Das Problem, auf das man slbflt,verz@ert das Pro jekt4 ConclusionIn this paper we proposed an architecture for the or-ganization of linguistic knowledge allowing for both(1) the separate formulation of generalizations fordifferent types of linguistic information, and (2)the use of relations to state correspondences be-tween partial information pertaining to different lev-els of linguistic description.
Typed feature terms areused for encoding linguistic knowledge; the TFS sys-tem incorporates a multiple inheritance mechanism,which allows to minimize redundancy within "spe-cialized" knowledge sources, like e.g.
the hierarchyof subcategorization types.
On the other hand, nointerfacing problems between different levels of lin-guistic description arise, due to the use of one andthe same data structure for representing allthese lev-els for a given linguistic object.
In addition, insteadof explicitly controlling complex interactions, therelational approach allows to constrain realizationchoices in generation as a result of the simultaneousapplication of distributed linguistic onstraints.The TFS system has been implemented inCommon-LISP by Martin Emele and Rdmi Z~jac\[EMELE/ZAJAC 1989A\], on Symbolics, TI Explorerand VAX.
Sample grammars have been documentedin \[EMELE 1988\] and \[ZAJAC 1989B\].
The specifi-cation of the knowledge sources is currently underway.5 AcknowledgementsOur proposal has benefited from discussions withStanley Starosta, Sergei Nirenburg and our col-leagues at the IMS, whom we would like to thankfor comments on previous versions of this paper.Re ferences\[A'#r-KAcI 1986\] Hassan Ai't-Kaci: "An Algebraic Se-mantics Approach to the Effective Resolution ofType Equations."
