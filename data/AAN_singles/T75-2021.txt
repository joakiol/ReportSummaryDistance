We haveworked out a dictionary for translating between what M.insky 'et.
ahare saying about frames and what we are saying about actors.
UsingPT .AS IV \ [A  \ [PLANNER- l i ke  System iV\[odeled on Actors\].wecan demonstrate important rela.tionships between the Minsky-framesand the PLANNER- l ike  form~.lisms.
PLASMA does not .use theQ A-4 context mechanism (Rulifson et.
al.
19'12): instead It usesexplicit tags in assertions to keep track of the state of affairs mvarious situations.
One  problem with the.QA-'i context mechanismis that the problem solver is forced to attempt to propagate allchanges in the situation immediately on a frame, shi(t since otherwiseinconsistent information will be inherited from the previoussituation.Another problem with Q A-4 context meclhanism is that it issometimes difficult to reason explicitly about various ~ituations usingit because situations \[frames\] are not explicitly part of the assertionsand goals.
Events that are Viewed from several:different viewpoints\[as in a murder mystery\] are diffic01t to handle.
Also It Is difficult toretrieve the appropriate prior sltuat!ons from memory to aid Inrecognition tasks using Q A-4 contexts.
However, without theexample of the Q A-,i contexts to guide us, we could never haverealized holy to deal with these, problems using' tagged assertions.The  context mechanism in' CONNIVER was modeled on the one i~no_..A-4.Actors make a contribution to the "dec\[aratlve-procedure"controversy in that they subsume both the behavior of pureprocedures \[functions\] and pore declaratives \[data structures\] asspecial cases.
In this paper we use actors to investigate the questionof how to do procedural attachment to frames \[McCarthy 1969,?
Minsky et.
al.
1974\].
Actors.
provide an approach to solving to theproblem of how to attach procedures to frames in such a way thai theappropriate procedure is invoked with the inherited knowledge of theframe within Which the procedure is incorporated, as well as newlyintroduced knowledge from other frames.
Our approach alsoincorporates the insight gained from PLANNER-l ike formalisms\[Hewitt 1969, 1971; Rulifson 1972; .Davies: 197'2; Sussman andMcDermott 1972, Hewitt et.

\[ talk about markers andassignments as though it were obvious how they areattached and linked; it is not, "Marvin Minsky i~74 ~FRAMES like ACTORS are difficult to define and motivate.Through the dint of much effort \[C,reif and Hewitt 1975\] actors arenow becoming quite well defined \[even axiomatized!\]..
In this paperwe make a stab at similarly starting to pin down and unify variousnotions of "frames".
We have observed a tendency for people to gethung up on extraneous details as they attempt to understand thesedifficult concepts.
The?notion s of default values and expectations inparticUlar are a cause of diff.iculty.
For example expectation ?
is oftenconfused with scientific' prediction.
In attempting to sort all this out,we have  found the methodology of CONJECTURES andREFUTAT IONS as expounded by Karl Popper tobe of great value.The  relationships between the assertional frames of McCarthyand the object frames of Minsky are explored m this paper usingPLASMA.
PLASMA allows us to demonstrate a kind orisomorphism between assertional frames and object frames.
UsingPLASMA accomplishes procedural attachment for both kinds offrames and shows how to move between object and as~ertionalframes.Asser t iona l  F rames  anc~ Semant ic  Nets.The example given ?below was originally used by TerryWinograd to illustrate the properties o( Semantic Nets in his.informal survey entitled "Fiv.e Lectures on Artificial Intelligence'.Scott Fahlman is currently considering how to build a special purposemachine to solve such problems.
We first give a formulation interms of assertional frames.
The addition of assertions of the form(... never-are ...) was inspired by Grossman \[1975\].
It is interesting tospeculate whether the formulation in terms of assertiona\[ frames is asplausible a psychological model for humans as the formulation interms of semantic nets.Formulated  in Asser t lona l  F rames(Kazuo ~ people)((Kazuo owns Fido) in s O)(Fido (dogs)(dogs eat meat)(cows give meat)(dogs never-are people)?

"'Marvin Mlnsky 1974Worlds have many of the behaviors attibuted to 0bject frames{Minsky 19"H} and assertional frames {McCarthy and Hayes 1969}.
Inparticular worlds exhibit a very flexible form of inheritance ofattributes which is realized through the mechanism of messagepassing.Progress ive  Ref inement  of  P lansPart of Minsky's birthday party frame includes aPLANNER-style general plan for getting ready for a birthday pal"ty.It illustrates how PLANNER-style plans.are a natural component offrame systems.
In PLASMA the general plan can be expressed asfollows:qs"\[echieve-guest-attends-birthday-party-for-guest-of-honor(to (achieve (=guest attends birthday-party \[or =guest-of-honor))(choose(-present is-~uitobie-present~\[or guest-of-honor groin guest)(then:(achieve(^(guest has present)(guest i,t,-dressed-\[or birthday-party))(then:(achieve(luest is-pre~en't-rtt birtllday-porty\]'or guestoof-honor)))))))\]We use the above general plan as a template to write moreparticular plans tailored to special circumstance by progressiverefinement of plans \[Hewitt IJCAI-?I\] of'the plan.
This technique isan incremental glorified version of iqline substitution of procedurebodies for their invocations which has been ge.neralized to deal withpattern directed invocation.
Cheatham and .Wegbreit \[19"/3\] andBurstall and Darlington \[1975\] have studied the problems involved inthe absence of pattern directed invocation.We will suppose that early one morning that Marvin has beentold that there will be a birthday party for Seymour the next evening.The above plan becomes specialized as follows:\[achieve-Marvin-attends-birthday-party-for-Seymour(to(achieve (Marvin attends birthday-party \[or Seymour))(choose(=present is-suitable-present-\[or Seymour .from Marvin)(then:(achieve(^(Marvin has present)(Mary n is-dressed-got birthday-party))(then:(achieve(Marvin is-present-at birthday-.party}'or Seymour)))))))\]'As Marvin rehearses?
his planned' actions for the day his plan?
becomes further specialized.
Eva, who is a friend of Seymour,probably will have suggestions as to what might be a suitable presentfor Seymour.
Also, a party for Seymour Is not the kind of affair thatguests dress up for.
These considerations result in the followingrefinement of the plan: ..\[Marvin-attends-birthdsy-psrty-for-Seymour ?
(ask (Eva which =present is-a-suitoble-present-}'or Seymour .from Marvin)(then:(Marvln~ets-money '(su\[\[icient-to-buy present)(then:(Marvin-buys present(then:(Marvin-goes-tO (home-of Seymour) ,at (time-of(birthd,ly-parly-ot Seymour)))))))))\]The above plans were formulated between yawns as Marvinawakened the morning, of the partyProcedura l  A t tachment  in  Asser t iona l  F rames"/!
situation s is the complete state of the universe at aninstant of time.
We denote by Sit the set of all situations.Since the universe is too large for complete description, we shallnever completely describe a situation; we shall only give factsabout situations.
These facts will be used to deduce furtherfacts about that situation, about future situations and aboutsituations that persons can bring about from that situation,?
.
.
o~Ve shall further assume that the lows of motion determinefrom a situation all future "situations.
{This assumption isdiff icult to square with quantum mechanics, and relat~ely tellsus that any assignment of simultaneity tO events in differentplaces is arbitrary.
However, we are proceeding on tEe'basis tealmodern pkysics is irrelevant to common tents deciding WEar todo, and in particular is irrelevant to solving tee 'free .willproblem':}"John McCarthy 1969In addition to making the assumptions listed above McCarthyand Hayes also assume the existence of a functional which maps aglobal state in .to the "nexC global state.
Although.we shall use tagson assertions and goals to relativize them to particular situations,hypotheses, and contexts we do not want to make any of the globalassumptions of McCarthy and Hayes.
All of our situations will belocal and completely consistent with relativity and.
quantummechanics.
For a discussion of the issues involved in this decisiottfor  the actor model of computation see Greif and Hewitt \[19'/5\].The Pattern Directed Invocation \[Hewltt 1969\] incorporated inPLANNER- l ike systems accomplishes proced~iral attachment forassertional frames \[McCarthy 1969\].
'This procedural attachment iscarried down to the level of the quantificatlonal calculus ?where wehave shown \[Hewitt 1975a\] how' the logical operators of  thequantificational calculus {V, 3, implies, ^, v, -, etc.}
can bebehaviorally defined as actors.
We use the following kinds of tags inassertions to relatlvlze the assertions in the desired manner:.

physical statesmental stateslogical hypotheticalshypothesesview pointsgoal statespredictionsdefaultsStereotypesWe introduce s tereoty 'pes  as an actor version of a frametheory.
Our notion' of a stereotype incorporates ideas fromassertional frames \[McCarthy 1969\], act~ worlds \[He'witt 1969, 1973\],world-directed invocation \[Hewitt 1969; 1971, 19"/3; Stansfield 1975\];social frames \[Goffman 197st\], and object frames \[Minsky et.
al.
19'/'t\].A stereotype consists of a set of the following parts:a collection of characteristic objectscharacteristic relations for those objectsa set of plans invoked by world directed invocationfor transforming the objects and relations%?It seems that many of the behaviors attributed to frames byMinsky can be realized by stereotypes.
The characteristic objects ofa stereotype correspond closely to the slots of a. Minsky frame and thecharacteristic relations of a stereotype correspond to the constraintsof a Minsky frame.
Minsky calls simp\]e ,ma.ry characteristic relationsmarkers.
We instantiate stereotypes somewhat differently from theway in which Minsk?
instantiates object frames.
Our approach is toplug in definite candidates for all the characteristic objects of astereotype that we can and use anonymous objects for the rest.Defaults are done as assertions tagged tO indicate that they aredefaulted so that they can be easily displaced if an anomaly develops.Stereotypes communicate by making assertions in the data base andby world directed invocation which is a generalization of patterndirected ?invocation in which the invocation is done on the basis of afragment Of a micro-world instead of a single assertion.

CONNIVER attempted to solving the scoping control 'problem by introducing possibility lists and Landln-stylenon-hierarchical gotos.
However possibility lists proved to ?haveseveral deficiencies?
They introduced side-effects into the.
basiccommunication mechanisms in CONNIVER which, made it dif f icultfor  users to debug their programs since doing a try-next operation toIIIIIIIIlIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIprint the next possibility destructively interferes with the operation ofthe programs being debugged.
The other, basic communicatiollmechanisms of CONNIVER similarly have intrinsic'~ide-effects builtinto their very structure.
"Their \[Sussman and McDermott\] sohttion, to give theuser access to the implementation primitives ofPI,/INNER, is however, something of a retrograde.step(what are CONNIVER's semantics?

representational scheme concerned with deductive cqntroi.
"Pat llayes 1'974Nested continuation control structure gives us the ability toinfluence or control any decision to the extent we desire.
For example,in case of the apartment finder above, we can explicitly communicatecomplaints as to why a particular apartment is unacceptable in orderto try to infiuence the selection of further proposed apartments.\[unacceptable-apartment-if-too-expensive B(to(refute (rapt is-an-acceptable-apartment)(with-c.omplaint-dept: =the-comptain-dept)) '\ [ i f  (\[rent apt) ~; S300)(then:(the-complaint-dept <= (rent-of apt is-too-high)))))\]\[unaccept able-apartment -if-doesn't-have-dishwasher ?

PLASMA is able toaccomplish this by basing its semantics on actor message passing andslightly changing the syntax ofPLANNER-?I, The change in syntaxprovides us with natural places to incorporate the (:ontrol informationand enables us to avoid the gratuitous ide effects !n PLANNER-?LUni f i ca t ion  o f  Pat tern -D i rec ted  Invocat ionWe do not want to have .to explicitly ?store every piece ofknowledge .which we have but would like to be able to deriveconclusions from what is already?
known using procedures.
Using thedistinguished symbol when with the syntax(when trigger consider-trying b.ody)or completely equivalently using the distinguished symbol to with thesyntax(to trigger consider-trylng body)creates a p lan  \[high level goal-oriented procedure\] that can beinvoked by pattern directed invocation by a trigger Which matchestrigger.
The following are all special case plans which are defined interms of the above general pattern directed invocation machinery.
(to (demonstrate hypothesis) consider-trying body)(when (assert statement.)
cons(clef-trying body)(to (dlsrzchiew condition) consider-trying bo.dy) '(when (deny statement) consider-trying body)(to (refute hypothesis) consider-trying body)(to (find description) consider-tr~ing body)(to (achieve condition) consider-tryhtg body)Additional kinds of plans can be defined as they are needed.The process of.
invoking plans in worlds is controlled byrecommendations made to the world when the plan is put in theworld and by recommendations made at the site where a request ismade of the world to achieve a particular goal.
We envisage thatproblem solving would begin in a world with an initial class of plans.In many cases most of the plans that are used in.
the ultimate solutionof the problem need to be constructed by other plans during theproblem solving process.
This is ilTustrated in a limited way by thedomain of logic which is given as an example in Hew(st \[IJCA\]-75\].Pattern Directed Invocation Using AnonymousObjectsOne important way in which plans can communicate isthrough making assertions, erasures, denials using worlds which theyshare in common?
Another important means of communication isthrough pattern directed invocation.
An important echnical problemin implementing pattern directed invocation is how to solve theproblem of matching the invoking pattern with the pattern in thetrigger of the ?pattern of the plan being invokecl..PLASMA usesanonymous objects to solve the .problem.
We assume the existence ofa generator capable of generating new anonymous individuals anon I,anon 2, etc.
which have never before been encountered.
To show theutil ity of such a generator consider the problem of proving (x c_.
z) \[xis a subset of z\] where we have a world which Contains:(x c:w)(x c_ y)(y ~ z)\[demonstrate-?-= ;define the plan'demonstrate-c_ to be(to (demonstrate (=a~ =c)) try;to demonstrQte that a is a subset o'\[ e try(demonst#ate (a C- fib);to demonstrate ihata is a subset of another set \[eall'~t b/(then: ;then(demonstrate (b C- C)?
;demonstrtite .hat b is a subset of c(using: set-theory)))(using: set-theory)))\] "The problem is solved by "wishful thinking'?
i.e.
reasoningwithin a hypothetical world.
Unfortunatelywe do not have the fact(x ?
z) explicitly given to us and so must do .some computation.
Wenote that we have a plan whose trigger (=a c: --c) matches what weare trying to achieve and so turn control over to it to see what it cando.
In order to find b_ such that (x C- b_) we let b_ be anon I which is anever before encountered individual which we wish to have certainproperties.
Then we note that anon I might be w. But we are unableto demonstrate \[w ?__ z) so we reconsider and see that anonl might bey.
We successfully demonstrate?
(y c_ z) and so the problem is solved..~7?

are prepared I0learn from our mistakes.Karl R. PopperPhilosophically, this section builds on some work by KarlPopper on Conjectures and Refutations as a scientific methodology.More concretely it builds on a fine piece of work Ben Kuipers did onrecognition of kinds of blocks \[Kuipers 1974\].
The reader is referredto KuIpers!
paper for various kinds of discussion and backgroundwhich will not be repeated here.
The recognition problem Is toincrementally recognize the above three kinds of blocks.
This kindof problem has been extensively investigated by.robot projects at theM.I.T.
Artificial intelligence Laboratory, the Stanford ArtificialIntelligence Laboratory, and the S.R.I.
Robot Project.
In order tofacilitate comparison, we have fairly closely followe.d Kuiper'sscenario.
Our motivation in re-exploring the block recognitionproblem is to Investigate some techniques that have been developedby Marllyn McLennan for the very difficult.
'domain ofunderstanding plant pictures.
We wanted to investigate a techniquethat she is developing for resolving conflicts, between conflictinghypotheses recognition problems in another domain.We have modified Kulpers scenario of the recognition of ablock using stereotypes by using three-dimension stereotypes Insteadof the two-dimensional views which he used.
Thesethree-dimensional stereotypes are reminiscent of.
some of thethree-dimensional "models" used in the robot vision programs.

However, the cube stereotype iis reluctant to give up completely so it Imagines one of its sides II shrunk down to an edge to fit the data.

We assume.that he result oflooking at the cube pictured belowIOf  course the situation of the cube has not changed but we have thefollowing additional information:((C has-color white) in situation 1)(C is-a-view-o j" facef o\[ cube l) .
.How if  we imagine moving back to \[he left, we can hypothesize theview without any perceptual computation at all.
We simply imaginethat the new view view 3 is the same as view i.
((view 3 = view 1) in hypothesis l)However, moving back to the left we are surprised to find thatin the new view \[view 3\] that A has changed color to while!

is rejected.
We also notice that((floor has flecks-of-white-paint) in view3)"which causes us to construct another hypothesis"(situation 2 = (pain!
A white in situationl))((view 3 is-a-IJiew-o\[ situation 2) in hYpothesis2) .Further careful observation and testing.does not refutehypothesis 2, so situation 2 can inherit suitably transformed attributesfrom situation I using the hypothesized paint transition.More  .
?n  I nher i tan ,ce  o fAt t r ibutesThe "frame" problem of McCarthy for assertional framescorresponds closely to the problems of "inheritance of attributes" and view II " "default values" for object frames.
For example the fable quoted byis the following symbolic description: Minsky about the wolf and the lamb is very close to the frameproblems of McCarthy.
((A has-color red) in view I )I ((B has-color while)in view|) .
.Recently Keith Nishihara has reconsidered the problem of((E hr=s-eelor white)in view I ) gluing blocks together from t.he point of inheritance of.attributes.

(E in-a-view-of ace s of cube 1)so we have the following additional assertions:When we move to the right, face A disappears fromview,I while the new face decorated with C is now seen.II view 2IThe new view has the following symbolic description:(view 2 ?

For example, Waltz's program \[Waltz1972\] is the latest in a line of development called scene analys, whichwas originated by Guzman \[1968\], and pursued by Huff man \[1970\]and Clowes \[1971\].
The usefulness' of this appro;ich is called intoquestion by the difficulty of extracting, from information aboutintensity and color, the near perfect line drawing that such programsrequire; and by the restricted nature of the line drawingrepreseniation itself~ Waltz has demonstrated" that when a moredetailed categorization of the kinds of labels is made that the numberof ambiguous line drawings decreases dramatically.
"We greatly admire Waltz's program, .but we f~ l  that theapprOach that it embodies is open to several criticisms.
The first isthat the knowledge that it uses is in a certain sense not explicitenough.
Although it contains a great deal of.
information about theappearance of line drawings, this information is essentially, in acompiled form: one reflection of this ts that the structure of Waitz'sprogram makes it inherently unable to use either explicit informationabout the three-dimensional form of what is being viewed, or themany pieces of special and general knowledge that we surely bring tobear on the process of seeing.'
Essentially, the only way one.canattempt to influence the program is by adding or deleting junctionsfrom a large table of "legal" labellings.
There is no way in whichpieces of its knowledge can be pulled out and examined while tt triesto create an interpretation of, for example, a scene in which severallines are missing.
Unless such knowledge, suitably embedded in ahypothetico-deductive system, can play a large part in the operationo fa  vision program, we see no prospect of such a program beingable to interpret the incomplete information that is the diet of dailylife.The basic trouble with the labelling approach of scene analysis isthat it is too limiting and stultifying a paradigm for vision, in much.the same way that resolution is for  deduction.
The fundamental?
principle of resolution, that (- A) and {A v B,) together imply B, isoccasionally useful, But attempting to make a uniform resolutionproof procedure, to mechanize deduction in a way that cannot bevery sensitive to hints, hunches, and a wide variety or higher levelknowledge about the particular domain in question, is a cul-de-sac.Similarly, the line and vertex labels are local, predicates that areoccasionally useful, and are of ?some mathematical interest in theirown right: but the problem of creating a uniform procedure to labelarbitrary line drawing is not a central one for vision.
Hence, webelieve that the kind of knowledge contained in Waltz's program isprobably relatively unimportant; and that the way in which it is madeavailable there is certainly too restricting.The proper endeavor of vision research is to decide whatk.nowledge should be used to help a vision system to see, and todiscover methods that make it possible to use such knowledge.
Howcan one pursue this goal more effectively?
There are several kinds ofanswers.
The first is to abandon the restrictive format of linedrawings, so that programs can use information about visual featuresthat are not coded in this form.
There is a large gain to be had byloosening up our formalisms to incorporate the many .pieces of specialand general knowledge that are necessary for purposeful vision in thereal world.
Vision is primarily a.util tarian functmn in order to seeproperly it is necessary to know what kind of information is sought.We believe that progress in particular domains of recognitionon the following problems will pay.
large dividends:Getting Started: How to proceed from a set offeature clues to more global hypotheses.
How toincorporate parallelism into this process:Keeping Going: How to recognize and mechanizeconfrontations between cohflicting hypotheses~ How toretain and use valid information that was incorporated in.hypotheses that have been refuted.Fur the~ .WorkThe PLASMA system described in this paper is currently beingimplemented at the MIT  Artificial lntell!gence Laboratory.
Thebestversion which currently runs was coded by Howle.Shrobe.
A better'humanly engineered version has been designed and coded by CarlHewitt In PLASMA with the extensive aid of Marilyn McLennan,At  the time of this writing \[March.
1975\] the new implementation isbeing translated into LISP by the MIT laboratory course 6.89'3:"Implementation and Application of Actor Systems'.
A rough draftof a primer by Brian Smith and Carl Hewi t t for  the newimplementation exists.A._ ck .nowledgementsThe research reported in this.paper was sponsored by the MITArtif icial Intelligence and Laboratory and Project MAC under thesponsorship of the Office of Naval Research.The" main example in this paper is?adapted from a very niece.piece of work by Ben Kulpers.
The major change we made in hisscenario was to introduce three-dimensional models and to try toreason as much as possible in three-dimenslonaJ terms.
MarilynMcLennan, Ben Kuipers, and Candy Bullwinkle made helpfulcomments and criticisms which considerably improved theintelligibility and content of this paper.
The progress we havemadeon actors would have been completely impossible without thecontributions and questions of numerous MIT students?
BenKulpers, Howie Shrobe, Keith Nishihara, Brian Smith, AklYonezawa, Richard Steiger, and Peter Bishop, and Irene Greif havedone much of the work in making actors intelligible and relevant tothe problems of constructing knowledge-based systems.
Irene Grelf isdoing exciting work in extending behavioral semantics to the area ofinter-process communication, and puttingsemantics on a more socialfoundation?
Ho.wie Shrobe, Brian Smith, Todd Matsun,.
Roger Hale,and Peter Bishop have contributed to the multitude of "throw-away"implementations through which ?have we debugged many.
Of ourideas.IIlIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlIIIIIIThis paper builds on ex{ensive previous work on frames,paradigms, and hypotheses done b.y Fahlman, Hewitt, Kuhn, Kuipers,McCarthy, Minsky, Nishihara, Polya, Popper, and Winograd.
Ournotion ot ~ a stereotype is strongly reminiscent of the the logical notionof a formal system.
However, stereotypes are used quite differently.Putting tags on assertions as advocated in this .paper to record thestate of affairs in various' local situations eems more powerful andflexible than the context mechanism invented by Rulifson for Q A-~and later adopted by CONNIVER.
Tags .on assertions havepreviously been used to a limited extent in PLANNER-69\[MICRO-PLANNER\] by Charniak and Biss to record situations.They are closely related to the global ~ituations \[frames\]of McCarthy.The criticism of the line-labelling approach to vision comes fromMarr and Hewitt 1973.
Many of the ideas have emerged from theM IT course 6.893: "implementation and Application of Actor Systems"given in the spring of 1975 with the following participants: RussAtkinson, Mike Freiling, Kenneth Kahn, Keith Nlshihara,MarilynMcLennan, Howie Shrobe, Kathy Van Sant, and Aki Yonezawa.Hewitt, C.
