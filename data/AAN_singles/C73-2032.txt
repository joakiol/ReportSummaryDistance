I-IBI~Z J. WEBEaTHE AUTOMATICALLY BUILTUP HOMOGRAPH DICTIONARY- A COMPONENT OF A DYNAMIC LEXICAL SYSTEM -O. Introduction.Ambiguous word forms (often called "homonyms " or - in writ-ten language - "homographs ") are known as obstacles in many fieldsof computational linguistics, especially in automatic documentation,content analysis or mechanical translation.
In this respect two problemsmust be distinguished:1) the detection of homographic word fonus in the text,2) their disambiguation by analysis procedures.This paper exclusively deals with the first problem.1.
The Detection Of Homographs.1.1.
In current procedures for the detection of homographs twoalternatives can be differentiated:i) Homographs are identified like monosemic word forms by seg-mentation and looking up in the standard lexicon.
Homographs aredetected, if segments of text word forms correspond with more thanone lexicon-entry.
Lexicon-entries representing homographic itemstherefore need no special marking.ii) Homographs are identified by means of a special homographdictionary, which can be worked out in two versions:1) the homograph dictionary contains the graphenfic shapes ofall homographic word forms (full forms) and their possible linguisticspecifications.
In this case no segmentation procedures are required.2) the dictionary does not contain full forms but only the respectivecanonical forms.
A special marking gives information about othercorresponding dictionary-entries and the extent of their overlapping.458 tmNz j. WF~RIn both cases (1) and (2) the identification of homographic textword forms is separated from the identification of monosemic ones.Procedures (i) and (ii) have some characteristic advantages anddefects, which I will consider ather briefly.1.2.
As already pointed out the first method requires (1) a segmen-tational algorithm, with the help of which the word forms of a textcan be parsed into segments (e.g.
stems and inflectional affixes), (2)an identificational component composed of a grapheme-sequence-comparing algorithm and the standard lexicon; thus it can be checked,whether a text segment detected by (1) is the expression-side of one (orperhaps more) lexical unit(s).
If this is the case, the content-side(s) ofthe corresponding unit(s) can be assigned to the text segment.1.2.1.
According to this conception the identification of wordforms would offer no problems in the following cases:i) the word form represents only one sequence of segments (ismonosemic), that means that each segment corresponds to one lexicon-entry:Germ.

If the entries are arranged in alphabetical order, the respectiveunits will immediately succeed one another.1.2.2.
The detection becomes difficult however, if one word formis parsed into more than one set of segments (is homographic), whilethe segment-boundaries in the possible readings are overlapping:Germ.

: ...f3valaxf3... -/val/q-/ax/ val/valax/+/O/ valaxAs the segments which have thus been detected o not coincidegraphematically (e.g./trieb/-/getriebe{), i.e.
as the respective l xicon-entries are to be fotmd at different places in the lexicon, for the identif-ication of such homographs enormous parsing - and comparing -procedures are required.
As cases of homography with overlappingsegment-boundaries n the various readings are encountered quitefrequently in languages with extensive inflection (e.g.
German, French,Russian), method 1.1.
(i) is not the best in any case.1.2.3.
The advantage of this method is above all to be seen in thefact that the identification of homographs can be managed automati-cally, and that no special marking of the respective entries is necessary.This is especially important with regard to dynamic lexical systems,where the number of lexicon-entries and their specification can vary;new entries do not require a change of the detection procedure.
Thedisadvantage consists in the fact that monosemic and ambiguous wordforms are submitted to the same procedure, which amounts to an unduedelay of the determination fmonosemic word forms.
Multiple parsingwith subsequent lexicon-look-up has always to be applied if the re-spective text word forms contain grapheme sequences, whidl correspondto inflectional affixes.
Only after this can it be found out whether morethan one plausible reading has resulted:460 HEINZ J.

Method 1.1.
(ii) does not have this disadvantage.
Homographsare separately registered and marked according to their readings; thusa considerable acceleration of the identificational procedure is madepossible.
Monosemic word forms, the stems of which are listed up inthe standard lexicon, are identified more easily, as the segmentation a dlexicon-look-up can already be stopped after assignment of one reading.Ambiguous word forms are specified more easily, as the extensivesegmentation- and comparing-procedures do not have to be applied(as the various readings are registered in the homograph dictionary- version 1.1.
(ii) (1) -) or are reduced to a minimum (as the respectivelexicon-entries bear a special marking, by which their homographycan be derived - version (ii) (2) -).
These advantages however entailcertain disadvantages: as a rule homograph dictionaries are built upmanually and have to be manually complemented, when the standardlexicon is extended; the same has to be stated for the marking of lex-icon-entries.
Aside from this troublesome and time-consuming businessone cannot be sure that all homographies are registered or are markedexhaustively.2.
The Automatically Built Up Homograph Dictionary.2.1.
In this paper a method will be outlined, in which the advan-tages of the first procedure are combined with those of the second one:the standard lexicon therefore can be extended automatically' withoutdelaying the identificational procedure.
The homograph dictionary iscompiled by analysis of the standard lexicon; all stems representinghomographic items are taken away from it and integrated into thehomograph dictionary.
The same algorithm, which detects homogra-phies incorporated in the standard lexicon, can be used to find out byanalysis of both lexica, whether new entries and all inflected formsrepresented by them are homographs.
If this is the case, they are re-gistered in the homograph dictionary, otherwise in the standardlexicon.
Thus the number of entries in both lexica can be increasedTHE AUTOMATICALLY BUILT UP HOMOGRAPH DICTIONARY 461automatically and the specifications of ambiguities in the homographdictionary always correspond to the current state of information.New Entries~ standard Lex\[icon ...A lgor i thm.~~Homograph Dictionary ...2.2.
The standard lexicon can be characterized as follows: thelexicon-entries are "stems "; each stem representing a set of inflectedforms, which is called a "paradigm " or "part of a paradigm ".
Inorder to abbreviate the graphemic assimilation of text word forms tothe graphemic shapes of lexicon-entries during the identificational pro-cedure, morphologically and syntactically determinated allomorphshave also been noted.
Stems of complex lexical units (e.g./kickOtheObucket/, /zumOzugOkomm/) are, however, ignored:stems of (Get.)
graben (VRB): /grab/, /grub/beipflichten : \[beipflicht/, pflicht/ ...stems of (Eng.)
to sing: /sing/, /sang/, /sung/stems of (Frc.)
mourir: /mour/, /meur/, /mort/ ....stems of (Rus.)
reMnok: /reb~nok/,/reb~nk/, ...2.3.
The homograph dictionary is built up by comparing selectedentries of the standard lexicon.
In order to elucidate the comparingprocedure we restrict ourselves to the coordination of just two lexicon-entries.
Two stems represent homographic nflected forms, if the fol-lowing conditions are fulfilled:i) The graphemic shapes of the stems belonging to the paradigmsP1 and P2 are identical:In this case homography exists, if any inflectional affixes co-occurringwith the respective stems are homographic too:462 HmNZ J. WEBERii) The graphemic shape belonging to the stem of paradigm P~,concatenated with a sequence G~, is homographic with the stem ofparadigm P~:In this case the graphemic shapes of the co-occurring inflectional af-fixes have to correspond in the following way:G~(Vl) \ G,, ~ G}(P~).Concerning Gk some restrictions have to be observed:iii) G~ has to be homographic or partially homographic with anyinflectional affix of the respective language:G~ ~ G~, for G~ as an element of the finite set ~,,  which contains allinflectional affixes.iv) G~ for its part must be co-occurring with the respective stemof the paradigm:=- G (Vx).The co-occurence of stem and affix is specified by the respective in-flection-class-marking of the lexicon-entry.2.4.
Conditions (i) and (ii) determine the selection of stems.
(iii)prevents that all partially homographic stems in the lexicon are selectedand examined.
Thus - for example - a coordination of the Germanstems/arm/Arm and/armee/Armee is not permitted (though they arefulfilling condition (ii): Gs(PI)?/...ee/~= G~(P~.
)), as the sequenceG, =/...eel does not fulfill the condition G, ~ G}.iv) further reduces the number of the selected stems to thosecases, where G} (~_ G,) is co-occurring with Gs(Pl) (e.g.
German/schwer/schwer and/schwert\[ Schwert are not combined, though bothstems fulfill conditions (ii) and G~ (=/...t/) fulfills condition (iii); butG~ does not fulfill (iv):/...tl is not homographic with an affix co-occur-ring with/schwer/ (ADJ)).The relationship between the graphemic shapes of the affixes co-oc-curring with the stems of both paradigms is finally specified by thecomplementary part of condition (ii): G}(P1) \ Gk ~ G~(P~).
E.g.
theGerman stems/hoer/ h6ren and/gehoer/ Geh6r (SUB) could be com-bined according to condition (i i):/hoer/?/ge.../~/gehoer/.
Moreoverconditions (iii) and (iv) concerning Gk =/ge.../ would be fulfilled:/ge.../c G~ and G~(=/ge-t/)---G}(Vl).

Prerequisites for the outlined algorithm are:1) a computerized stem-lexicon; the entries, which have to bearranged in alphabetical order, must bear an inflection-class-marking,which makes it possible to generate all inflected forms represented bythe respective stems:, o#/ficht\] :fechten, VRB, intl.-class 48/fichte/ : Fichte, SUB, intl.-class 5. .
.2) A complete list of inflectional affixes, which bear the possibleinflection-class-markings corresponding to those of the stems:/0/ : SUB, intl.-classes ..., 5 .

,/st/ : VRB, intl.-classes ..., 48, ...2.7.
The selection of stems and the comparison of the co-occurringinflectional afftxes could be carried out in a slightly modified way.
Asalready pointed out, the selection of stems is in the main determinedby the grapheme sequence G, (which specifies the graphematic over-lapping of non-homographic stems).
Further restrictions concern thecorrespondence b tween Gk and the inflectional affixes co-occurringwith the selected stems (see 2.3.
(iii) and (iv).
As the inflection-class-markings of stems and affixes (which are similar) are shortened distribu-tional classifications, it is obvious to bring them into a system, accord-ing to the respective specifications of Gk.
A matrix is built up bywhich it can be seen whether a G~ -specification restricts the coordi-nation of stems with certain inflection-classmarkings.
In this way thedetailed examination and comparison of all co-occurring affixes (inaccordance to condition 2.3.
(iv)) can be substituted by one singleoperation, at least in a good number of cases.THE AUTOMATICALLY BUILT UP HOMOGRAPH DICTIONARYcoordinated Gk-specifications of stem1 :intl.-classes ofstem,/stem, G, = ~...el .

In German we have found out ten frequentand about thirty extremely rare G~-specifications.
In English homo-graphies with graphemetically overlapping stems are without thatrather seldom.2.8.
The conceived algorithm selects just two entries (respectivelytheir paradigms), which are examined for homographic word forms.After the first cycle of selecting and comparing -as pointed out in 2.5.
-homographs, which are members of more than two paradigms (e.g.466 UEINZ j. w~RGerman OalbenO: Album, Alba, Albe, Albx, Alb~), therefore, are notspecified exhaustively:Album n Alba ={alben}Album A Albe = {alben}Album fl Alb~ ={alben}Album A Alb~ = {alben}Alba fl Albe ={alben}Alba I"1 Albx = {alben}Alba n Alb2 ={alben}Albe fl Alb, = {albe, alben}Albe fl Alb~ ={alben}Albl fl Alb~ = {alb, alben}In this example OalbenO is described as a member of altogetherten intersection sets (which are the results of the first coordination-cycle).
In a second cycle (which will not be dealt with in detail) allintersection sets of the first cycle are examined for identical word forms.Oalbenl3 now can be described as an intersection set of five paradigms:Album I"1 Alba fl Albe n Albl fl Alb~ ={alben}Albe fl Albl = {albe}Albl n Alb2 = {alb)The coordination of intersection sets in the second cycle is - as wellas the coordination of paradigms in the first one - determined byconditions, which are derived from the graphemic shapes of the respec-tive stems.
In all probability stems like /album/, /alba/, /albe/, /alb/will represent at least one homographic word form, while stems like/album/,/alge/,/al ibi/ , /altar/wil l  not.2.9.
As the outlined method of building up a homograph dic-tionary is, in the main, using facts of the expression-side of lexical units,it can be applied to various lexicon-types.
The content-sides of therespective entries (i.e.
stems) can bear either semantically, syntacti-cally or otherwise relevant information.REFERENCESH.
