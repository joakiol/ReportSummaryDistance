CLASSIF ICAT ION OF  MODALITY  FUNCTION AND ITS APPL ICAT IONTO JAPANESE LANGUAGE ANALYS ISShozo NArro ,  Ak i ra  SHIMAZU, and Hirosato NOMURAMusashino Electr ical  Communicat ion Laborator ies,  N.T.T.3-9-11, Midori-cho, Musashino-shi ,  Tokyo, 180, JapanAbstractThis paper proposes an analysis method forJapanese modality.
In this purpose, meaning ofJapanese modality is classified into four semanticcategories and the role of it is formalized into fivemodality functions.
Based on these formalizations,information and constraints to be applied to themodality analysis procedure are specified.
Then bycombining these investigations with case analysis, theanalysis method is proposed.
This analysis method hasbeen applied to Japanese analysis for machinetranslation.1.
I n t roduct ionSince the meaning of a sentence consists of bothproposition and rnodality, TM analysis of modality is asindispensable as that of proposition for naturallanguage understanding and machine translation.However studies on natural language analysis havemainly concerned with the propositional part, andalgorithms for analyzing rnodality have not yet beensufficiently developed.
The aim of this paper is toclarify the function of modality and to propose a methodfor analyzing the modality in Japanese sentences.Structure of a Japanese complex sentence can beformalized roughly by iterative concatenation of simplesentences.
The simple sentence consists of cases and apredicate.
The cases have surface representations ofnoun phrases or adverb phrases while the predicate hasthat of verb or adjective or adjective verb.
A nounphrase is defined as the recursive concatenation of nounphrase or that of embedded sentence.
We haveemployed '.he case structure as a basic meaningstructure for a simple sentence, and extended it toretain the construction of complex sentencesmentioned.
Modaiity is addit ive informationrepresented by auxi l iary words such as modal particles,ending particles, and auxi l iary verbs and sentenceadverbs.
The modal particle is attached to a nounphrase or a sentence lement while the ending particleis attached to the enci position of a sentence.
Theauxi l iary verb !mmediately follows a verb phrase.Modal ity represented in such grammat ica l ly  differentcontext is incorporated into the case structure, and theresult construction is named as an extended casestructure Ivl which enable us to propose a uniformframework for analyzing both proposition and modality.In this paper, we first classify modality into foursemantic categories.
Second, we define five modalityfunctions using the logical representation of themeaning and then characterize the roles of eachfunction.
Third, we specify hard problems to beresolved in modality analysis.
Fourth, we list theinformation and constraints to be considered inestablishing the procedure of modality analysis.
Then,we propose a method for analyzing modality based onthese investigations.
Finally, we exemplify theanalysis by showing translations from Japanese intoEnglish.
The method has been used to analyzeJapanese sentences in a machine translation system.
17~2, Classification of modalityTraditionally, modality has been classified intothree categories, i.e.
tense, aspect and modal.
:0-!
Thisclassification is not sufficient for the deep analysis ofthe meaning structure of a sentence, however, becauseit does not account for the role of Japanese modalparticles.
Adding this role, we expand thisclassif ication into four categories, namely tense, aspect,modal and implicature shown in Table 1.
Each categorycan be further classif ied into subcategories, and thoseare shown in Table 2 through Table 5 (Each table givesboth examples of Japanese expressions and theirEngl ish equivalents).
Our classif ication of modal i tyfeatures two character ist ics oncerning the ass ignmentof adverbs and modal part icles :(1) Among the two kinds of adverbs, namelysentence adverbs and case adverbs, we assignsentence adverbs to modal i ty while caseadverbs to case relations.
Sentence adverbs areclassified into three subcategories in the modalTable I.

Moda l i ty  functions and  their rolesBy  employing logical expression as therepresentation of the mean ing  structure, we can definemodality functions as operations on logical expressionsin strict terms.
In the past, studies on modalityanalysis in logical f ramework  treated each type ofmodality individually.
IsH6\] Here, we  deal with it,however, as a whole and combine it with thepropositional structure so that we can provide auniform f ramework for the representation and theanalysis of the mean ing  structure.
In this purpose weemploy the higher order modal  logic formalism.
It1In this regard, we  introduce the five types ofmodality functions, which add or modify modality :{I) addition of the modality operator.
{2) surface modification of the case structure.
(3) semantic modification of the case structure.
(4) determination of the scope of negation,(5) addition of the implicative meaning.We will now discuss the roles of each type ofmodality function respectively by indicating theirlogical representations.3.1 Add i t ion  of the modal i ty  operatorThis is the most fundamental  function and it simplyadds the modality mean ing  to the propositionalmeaning.
In the following two sentences, (sl) has nomodality while (s2) has modality :( s l )  Hiroko ga hashiru.
(Hiroko runs.
)Run(Hiroko),"~ In the ~'ollowing.

(s2) is obtained by adding the durat ive aspect operator"teiru (progressive)" to (sl) c'~.3.2 Sur face  mod i f i ca t ion  of the case s t ruc tureThis does not change the logical mean ing  structureeven when the surface structure is modified.
Howeverhigher level information such as focus and attent ion issometimes added.The passive auxi l iary verb "reru" or "rareru" canmodify the surface case structure without changing thelogical meaning structure.
The focus is usual ly placedon the ~ubject part of the passive sentence, as follows :(s3) Hiroko ga yasai we taberu.
(Hzroko eats vegetables.
},3x(Vegetable(x)AEat(Hiroko,x)),(s4) Yasai ga Hiroko ni tabe rareru.
(Vegetables are eaten by Hzroko.
),3x((Vegetable(x)AEat(Hiroko,x))A{Focus(x)}),where the predicate Focus(x) signifies that the focus isplaced on the argument  x.3.3 Semant ic  modif ication of the case structureThis results in one of the two alternatives :(a) one argument  is added to the original predicate,(b:, a higher order predicate is introduced.Both changes are equivalent in mean ing  but the way  ofrepresenting the change is different.The following fragments of modality cause thesemantic modification of the case structure :I) causative Cseru" or "saseru"),2J affected-passive Creru" or "rareru"),3) hope Ctehoshii'" and "temoraitai"),4~ request ,~"temorau"),5) benefit ("tekureru .... teageru", and "teyaru").Tabie 2.

(Hiroko eats nothing but vegetables.
)~x(Vegetable(x)AEat(Hiroko,x))Avx( -~Vegetable(x)~ -, Eat(Hiroko,x)).4, Problems in modality analysis4.1 Ambiguity of the modality mean ing(I) Ambiguity due to multiple meaningThe aspect expression "teiru" has three differentkinds of meanings, that is, the "durative", "iterative" or"terminative-state" aspects.
For example,(sll)Hiroko ga yasai wo tabe teiru.
(Hiroko {is eating, eats and eats.
has eatenlvegetables.
)3x(Vegetable(x)/x{\[durative\],\[iterative\],\[ termina tire-state\]}Eat(Hiroko, x)).
(21 Ambiguity concerned with case structureAs stated in Section 3.3 above, the auxiliary verb"reru" or "rareru" has five meanings, and, among them,the "passive" and "affected-passive" meanings result inmodification to the case structure.
Therefore,disambiguation of the meaning of ~reru" or "rareru"has a close relationship to analysis of the propositionalmeaning.Moreover the auxiliary verb "rareru" in thefollowing {s12) means "respect", and that in (s13)means "passive", respectively.
Whereas, bothexpressions are same except the additional meaning ofrespect and focus, as follows :(sl2)Sensei ga yasai wo tabe rareru.
(The teacher eats vegetables.
)3x(Vegetable(x)/kEat{the-Teacher,x))ARespect(Speaker,the-Teacher),(sl3)Yasai ga sensei ni tabe rareru.
(Vegetables are eaten by the Teacher.
;3x((Vegetable(x)/xEat(the-Teacher,x))/x{Focus(x)}),where the predicate Respect{x,y) means that x respectsy.4.2 Scope of modalityEven if',he main clause has a negative expression, itdoes not always mean that the main clause is negated.Sometimes the subordinate clause is negated.
We callthis phenomenon the transfer of negation.Furthermore even if rnodality involved is not negation,it sometimes affects the subordinate clause.Although the main clause in the following (s14) isnot usually negated, the subordinate clause is.Nevertheless, the tense information in the main clausehas an effect on the subordinate clause.
(s14) isconstructed from (s14-1) and (s14-2) by a simplecoordinate conjunction, however the correspondinglogical expression is not a simple concatenation of eachlogical expression :(sl4)Taro wa hige wo sot be kaisha e ika nakat ta.
(Taro went to the company without shaving.
)\[past\] -- Shave(Taro,beard)A{past\]Go(Taro,Company),(sl4-1)Taro wa hige wo soru.
(Taro shaves beard.Shave(Taro, beard),(sl4-2)Taro wa kaisha e ika nakat  ta.
(Taro did not go to the company.
)\[past\]-- Go(Taro, Company).
(sS) and (s9) also exemplify the problem for determiningthe scope of negation.4.3 Treatment of implicative mean ingModal particles such as "shika (only)" and "sae(even)" convey individual implicative meaning.
Inorder to obtain the logical representation of theimplicative meaning, we are forced to provide differentformulae expressive of the each meaning of each modalparticle.
For example, if we assign the formula (fl) tothe expression %hika...nai" which consists of the modalparticle "shika" and auxiliary verb "nai", we get thelogical representation of the sentence Is10) by theprocedure of ~,-calculus shown in Fig.
I.
(fl)"shika...nai'-- ~LP,kQkR(3x(P(x)ARQ(x))AVx(-,P(x)~R--Q(x))).As can be seen from the example, the logical formula forthe implicative meaning is very individual.
Thisconcludes that specification of it for each meaning isvery complicated and hard, and a more effective methodis therefore needed.5.
In format ion and constra ints  on modal i tyanalys is(1) l,exicai meaningThe lexical meaning assigned to each modalityexpression is the most fundamental information.
So weneed to specify and provide it.
For example, the lexicalmeaning of the auxiliary verb "ta" is generally the"past" tense as in :(slS)Hiroko ga hashit ta.
(Hiroko ran.)\[past\]Run(H.;roko).
(2) Predicate featuresPredicate features are available for disambiguatingthe meaning of modality.Though the aspect auxiliary verb "teiru" isambiguous in meaning, we can resolve it by usingpredicate features such as the "stative", "continuous"and "spontaneous", as in :30(sl6)Hiroko ga hashit  teiru.
(Hiroko is running.
)\[durative\]Run(Hiroko),(sl7)Akaxi ga kie teiru.
(The light is turned off.
)\[terminative-state\]Turn-off(the-Light),where the verb mnashiru (run)" has the "continuous"feature while the verb "kieru (turn off)" has the"spontaneous" feature.
The aspect expression "teiru"following a "continuous" verb usual ly means the"durative" aspect, and "teiru" following a"spontaneous" verb usual ly means the "terminative-state" aspect.The "spontaneity" meaning of "reru" or "rareru" isrealized only when it follows the verbs havingspontaneity feature such as "omoidasu (remember)" and"anjiru (care)".
(3) Noun phrases  and  adverbsSome kinds of noun phrases, adverbs, and theirsemantic ategories can be utilized to disambiguate hemeaning of modality, when they occur s imultaneouslywith it.
(sl8)Hiroko ga yasai wo i.m.a tabe teiru,(Hiroko is eating vegetables now.)3x(Vegetable(x)A\[durative\]Eat"(Hiroko,x,now)).

(Hiroko has already eaten vegetable.
)3x(Vegetable(x)A\[terminative-state\]Eat ' (Hiroko,x,a lready)) .In the above examples, the adverb "ima (now)" isconcerned with the "durative" aspect, while "sudeni(already)" is concerned with the "terminative-state"aspect.
The argument  z of the predicate Eat"'(x,y,z)represents time information.
(4) Moda l  par t ic lesAs discussed in Section 3 (sentences ( 8) and (s9)),the modal particle "wa" occurring s imultaneously withnegation suggests partial negation.
(5) Con junct ive  re la t ionsConjunctive relations are related to the scope ofmodality.
If the subordinate clause has the followingconjunctive relations represented by(a) the conjunctive particle "te", or(b) a relative noun such as "toki (trine)" or "mae(before)" modified by embedded sentences,the transfer of negation can be predicted as in sentence(s14).
Otherwise, the transfer will never occurs asfollows :(s20)Taro wa hige wo sot ta gakaisha e ika nakat  ta.
(Though Taro shaved his beard,he did not go to the company.
)\[past\]Shave(Taro,beard)A\[ past\] ~ Go(Taro,Company).
(6) Semant ic  re la t ions  between the subord inatec lause  and the main  c lauseThis information is used to determine the scope ofnegation in the main clause.
In the subordinate clausewith the conjunctive particle "te", if the event expressedby it is subsidiary for the occurrence of the event in themain clause, the transfer of negation can occur.
On theother hand, if the subordinate event is indispensable tothe occurrence of the main event, the transfer neveroccurs.
For example, in (s14), since the modifier eventShave(Taro,beard) is a subsidiary event for theoccurrence of the main event Go(Taro,Company), thetransfer of negation is possible.
In the followingsentence (s21), however, since the event Go(Taro,Washington) is an indispensable event for theoccurrnece of the main event See(Taro,White-House),the transfer ts impossible :(s21)Taro wa Washington e it teWhite House wo mi nakat  ta.
(Taro did not see the White Housewhen he went to Washington.
)\[past\]Go(Taro,Washington)A\[past\] -, See(Taro,the-White-House).316.
Modal ity analys is6.1 Strategy of the modal i ty  ana lys isConsidering the five modality functions defined inSection 3, it is apparent that the logical analysismethod alone is not effective for modality analysis.There are three reasons for this :(1) Reference to other expressions is needed toresolve the ambiguity of the modality function,(2) Structural modification occurs when the scopeof negation is transferred,(3) Analysis of the implicative meaning sometimescause the change of logical expression.There remains, however, the problem of taking theindividuality of each modality into account.
For somekinds of modality, the result of the case analysis or theconjunctive analysis is used to analyze it.
Theserepresent the reasons why we propose an analysismethod consisting of the following three modulescombined with the case analysis and the conjunctiveanalysis :( 1)pre-case-analysis :activated before the case analysis,(2)post-case-analysis :activated after the case analysis,(3)post-conjunctive-analysis :activated after the conjunctive analysis.The relationship of these three modules to the caseanalysis and the conjunctive analysis is shown in Fig.2.ore-case.analysis :I surface and semantic modification of the case framef\[ case analysis \]post-case-analysis : \[(I} disambiguation of the modality function \[E(2) determination of the scop~ of negation \[ (31 addition of the implicative meaningI c?njunctive analysis Ipost-conju nctive-an alysis :I determinatioa of the scope of the modalityin the main clauseFig.

Framework of the m,dality analysis6.2 Algorithms of each sub-analysis(1) Pre-case-analysisThe modality whose analysis requires only lexicalmeaning or which causes a change of the case structureis analysed at this stage.
The case frame to be assignedto the predicate is mcdified by utilizing the result ofthis analysis before starting the case analysis.
As forthe semantically ambiguous auxiliary verb "reru" or"rareru", its role is only predicted at this stage, becauseit is also concerned with the modification of the casestructure.
After case analysis, the plausibility of theprediction is evaluated.
The modification of the caseframe is as follows :(a) For the "passive" meaning of "reru" or "raxeru"(which causes a surface change to the casestructure as mentioned in Section 3.2), theobject case of the original case frame is changedinto the surface subjective case, and the modalitycategory "passive" is assigned to the meaningstructure.
If two object cases exist, two possiblemodifications are performed.
(b) With the modality causing a semantic change tothe case structure (for the modality functionstated in Section 3.3), a new case is added asfollows:(bl)For the "causative", "affected-passive","hope" or "request" meaning : A new agent (e.g.causative-agent / affected-agent) is added, andthe case particle of the original subjective case ischanged from "ga" to "hi",(b2)With the "benefit" meaning : A beneficiarycase is added.
The case particle in this case is"hi".Also the modality category corresponding toeach meaning (e.g.
"causative", "affected-passive") is assigned to the meaning structure.
(2) Post-case-analysisThe modality whose analysis requires case structureinformation is analyzed at this stage.
This moduledetermines the function of the modality as follows :(a) \[f the category of the modality expression isunique, this category is assigned to the meaning:;tructure.
(b) if a daemon (a procedure to resolve ambiguitiesby using heuristics) is attached to the rnodalityexpression, it performs the three tasks :(bl) disambignating the function of the modalityexpression,(b2) detcrmining the scope,(b3) adding the implicative meaning.The daemon utilizes the information mentioned in (I) -(4) in Sect, ion 5.
For example, a daemon attached to theaspect expression "teiru" works as shown in Fig.
3.
(3) Post-conjunctive-analysisFollowing the conjunctive analysis between thesubordinate clause and the main clause, this module isactivated to determine whether the modality in themain clause also operates on the subordinate clause.This module utilizes heuristics consisted of all of the32Is there a case element (noun phrase or adverb) suggesting"terminative-state" or "durative" or "iterative" aspect?

Heuristics which analyse the scopeof the auxiliary verb "ta"6.3 Application to Japanese analysis(I) Extended case analysisWe have already proposed a method namedextended case analysis for Japanese sentences.
IvT Inputto the extended case analysis is an ordered list of wordframes produced by a morphological analysis.
Theanalysis begins to predict a constituent construction ofthe sentence to be analyzed by utilizing syntacticstructure patterns, and then enter into the detailanalysis of semantic relations between pairs of themodifier and the modificant by utilizing semanticrelation frames.
There are four types of the semanticrelations, namely, case relation, noun concept relation,embeding relation and conjunctive relation.
All ofthese semantic relations are analyzed in a uniformframework.
The both analyses go on iteratively and/orrecursively from a small chunk of constituents to largeone.
Each iteration and recursion executes both theprediction of the syntactic structure and the analysis ofsemantic structure.
The modality analysis isincorporated into those processes.Let us show the modaiity analysis process for thefollowing example sentence :(s22)Niku wa nokot teite,yasai dake ga Kiroko ni tabe rare teita.Meat had remained, andonly vegetables had been eaten by Hiroko.At first, it is analysed that this sentence is a complexsentence by utilizing syntactic structure patterns.After semantic structures of the modifier and the mainclause are analysed, conjunctive relation between theseclauses is analyzed.
Now, we show analysis of the mainsentence.The following case elements and a predicate areanalysed by applying structure patterns before startingcase analysis :case1 = "yasai", "ga", "dake",case2 = ~liroko", "ai",predicate = "taberu", "rareru", %eiru", %a',where "dake", "rarern', "teiru", and "ta" are modalityexp~'essions.
"Hiroko" and "yasai" have semanticcategories, \[human\] and \[food\] respectively in eachword frame.
(2) Modification of case frameCase frame is prepared for each meaning of eachpredicate.
An  intrinsic case frame for the verb "taberu(eat)" is as follows (Optional cases such as time andplace are omitted here) :\[the intrinsic case frame of the verb "taberu (eat)"\] :Agent -- \[human\], "ga",Object = \[food\], ~wo".Each case slot in the case frame is assigned semanticcategories and case particles as constraints to besatisfied by the filler.The following alternative case frames produced bymodifying the intrinsic frame are also prepared beforestarting case analysis because of the existence of theauxil iary verb ~rareru" :\["passive" modification of the case frame\] :Agent = \ [human\] ,  "hi",Object = \[food\], "ga",\["affected-passive" modification of the case frame\] :Affected-agent - \ [human\] ,  "ga",Agent = \ [human\] ,  "ni",Object - \[food\], "wo".These three case frames are examined whether eachcase element in the sentence satisfies constraints.
As aresult, in this case, "passive" modification case frame isselected as a best matching, and case role of each caseelement is determined as follows :case l= Object, case2 = Agent.This result is showing that the meaning of ~rareru" is"passive".
(3) Determination of meaning of modalityModality by modal particles in case elements andattxiHary verbs are analyzed.
Analysis of "teiru" is:33performed by the heuristics shown in Fig.
3, where themeaning is determined as "terminative-state" judgingfrom the fact that "teiru" follows "raxeru".
Themeaning of the modal particle "dake" is multiple, thatis, "limitation" and "degree".
In this case, "limitation"is selected by heuristics.
(4) Determination of scope of modality in the mainc lauseAfter conjunctive analysis between the modifier andthe main clause, scope of the auxil iary verb "ta" in themain clause is analyzed.
Using heuristics shown inFig.
4, it is analyzed that "ta" also operates on thesubordinate clause.In a result, the meaning structure of (s22) isobtained as follows :3x((Meat(x)A\[past\]\[terminative-state \]Remain(x))A3x((Vegetable(x)A\[past\]\[terminative-state\]Eat(Hiroko,x))AVx(( -- Vegetable(x)~-, \[pastl\[terminative-state\]Eat(Hiroko,x))A{Focus(x)}).An  English sentence corresponding to this semanticstructure is shown in (s22).6.4 Virture of modality analysisWe show contributions of modality analysis tounderstanding and quality of translation for thefollowing example sentences.
(s23) Densha wa senro no ue shika hashirukotogadeki na_Ai ga, watashi ga kinoueiga de mi ta  densha wa sofa wo tobukotomodeki ta.Though a train can run only on a railroad, the train \[saw in a movie yesterday could also fly.
(s24) Anata wa densha ga sora wo tobukotogadekiru to omoi masu ka.Do you th ink that a train can fly?
(1) \[speech act\] As shown in (s24), modality containsmuch information concerning speech act (question,command, guess, intention, etc.).
In conversationalsystems such as qustion answering systems, thesemeaning can be used for selecting apropriate reactions.
(2) \[type of object\] Analysis results of aspect or tense areused for determining the type of objects.The subordinate clause of (s23) describes a generalcharacter of 'densha (trmn)", and the first occurrence of"densha" denotes a gener ic  object.
On the other hand,the second occurrence of "denaha" is modified by anembedded sentence, and "densha" denotes a specificobject which "I saw in a movie yesterday".
Like this, ifthe character of the event is analysed by the analysis ofaspect or tense, the character of the objects can bespecified.
(3) \[translation\] As shown in the translated sentencesin (s23) and (s24), results of the modality analysis areclearly realized in quality of translated sentences.
Inthese sentences, modality such as "limitation","negation", "ability", "past", "quetion" appears.7.
ConclusionWe proposed an analysis method for Japanesemodality.
In this purpose, we classified the meaning ofmodality into four categories, and then defined fivemodality functions which characterize the role ofmodality.
By employing logical expressions torepresent the meaning structure, we could effectivelyspecify the modality function.
Though logicalexpression has the same expressive power as frames orsemantic networks, a more concise semanticrepresentation can be realized by this method.Although we dealt with the modality analysisrestricted within the scope of one sentence in this paper,we must investigate the effect of discourse informationon the analysis of modality in the future.We have applied this modality analysis method tothe Japanese sentence analysis in the Japanese-English experimental machine translation system,LUTE.IV!References\[I\] Dowty, D.
