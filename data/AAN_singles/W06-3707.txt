Vo-cabulary ranges from about 350 to 1000surface words, depending on the languageand subdomain.
We will demo both thesystem itself and the development envi-ronment, which uses a combination ofrule-based and data-driven methods toconstruct efficient recognisers, generatorsand transfer rule sets from small corpora.1 OverviewThe mainstream in speech translation work is for themoment statistical, but rule-based systems are still avery respectable alternative.
In particular, nearly allsystems which have actually been deployed are rule-based.
Prominent examples are (Phraselator, 2006;S-MINDS, 2006; MedBridge, 2006).MedSLT (MedSLT, 2005; Bouillon et al, 2005)is a unidirectional medical speech translation systemfor use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues, whichcovers several different language pairs and subdo-mains.
Recognition is performed using grammar-based language models, and translation uses a rule-based interlingual framework.
The system, includ-ing the development environment, is built on top ofRegulus (Regulus, 2006), an Open Source platformfor developing grammar-based speech applications,which in turn sits on top of the Nuance Toolkit.The demo will show how MedSLT can be usedto carry out non-trivial diagnostic dialogues.
In par-ticular, we will demonstrate how an integrated intel-ligent help system counteracts the brittleness inher-ent in rule-based processing, and rapidly leads newusers towards the supported system coverage.
Wewill also demo the development environment, andshow how grammars and sets of transfer rules can beefficiently constructed from small corpora of a fewhundred to a thousand examples.2 The MedSLT systemThe MedSLT demonstrator has already been exten-sively described elsewhere (Bouillon et al, 2005;Rayner et al, 2005a), so this section will onlypresent a brief summary.
The main components area set of speech recognisers for the source languages,a set of generators for the target languages, a transla-tion engine, sets of rules for translating to and frominterlingua, a simple discourse engine for dealingwith context-dependent translation, and a top-levelwhich manages the information flow between theother modules and the user.MedSLT also includes an intelligent help mod-ule, which adds robustness to the system and guidesthe user towards the supported coverage.
The helpmodule uses a backup recogniser, equipped with astatistical language model, and matches the resultsfrom this second recogniser against a corpus of utter-ances which are within system coverage and trans-late correctly.
In previous studies, we showed thatthe grammar-based recogniser performs much bet-ter than the statistical one on in-coverage utterances,but worse on out-of-coverage ones.
Having the helpsystem available approximately doubled the speedat which subjects learned, measured as the averagedifference in semantic error rate between the resultsfor their first quarter-session and their last quarter-session (Rayner et al, 2005a).
It is also possible torecover from recognition errors by selecting a dis-played help sentence; this typically increases thenumber of acceptably processed utterances by about10% (Starlander et al, 2005).We will demo several versions of the system, us-ing different source languages, target languages andsubdomains.
Coverage is based on standard exami-nation questions obtained from doctors, and consistsmainly of yes/no questions, though there is also sup-port for WH-questions and elliptical utterances.
Ta-ble 1 gives examples of the coverage in the English-input headache version, and Table 2 summarisesrecognition performance in this domain for the threemain input languages.
Differences in the sizes of therecognition vocabularies are primarily due to differ-ences in use of inflection.
Japanese, with little in-flectional morphology, has the smallest vocabulary;French, which inflects most parts of speech, has thelargest.3 The development environmentAlthough the MedSLT system is rule-based, wewould, for the usual reasons, prefer to acquire theserules from corpora using some well-defined method.There is, however, little or no material available formost medical speech translation domains, includingours.
As noted in (Probst and Levin, 2002), scarcityof data generally implies use of some strategy to ob-tain a carefully structured training corpus.
If the cor-pus is not organised in this way, conflicts betweenalternate learned rules occur, and it is hard to in-Where?

As Probst and Levin sug-gest, one obvious way to attack the problem is toimplement a (formal or informal) elicitation strat-egy, which biases the informant towards translationswhich are consistent with the existing ones.
This isthe approach we have adopted in MedSLT.The Regulus platform, on which MedSLTis based, supports rapid construction of com-plex grammar-based language models; it uses anexample-based method driven by small corporaof disambiguated parsed examples (Rayner et al,2003; Rayner et al, 2006), which extracts most ofthe structure of the model from a general linguis-tically motivated resource grammar.
The result isa specialised version of the general grammar, tai-lored to the example corpus, which can then be com-piled into an efficient recogniser or into a genera-Language Vocab WER SemEREnglish 441 6% 18%French 1025 8% 10%Japanese 347 4% 4%Table 2: Recognition performance for English,French and Japanese headache-domain recognisers.?Vocab?

Regulus-based recognisers and gen-erators are easy to maintain, and grammar struc-ture is shared automatically across different subdo-mains.
Resource grammars are available for severallanguages, including English, Japanese, French andSpanish.Nuance recognisers derived from the resourcegrammars produce both a recognition string and asemantic representation.
This representation con-sists of a list of key/value pairs, optionally includingone level of nesting; the format of interlingua andtarget language representations is similar.
The for-malism is sufficiently expressive that a reasonablerange of temporal and causal constructions can berepresented (Rayner et al, 2005b).
A typical exam-ple is shown in Figure 1.
A translation rule mapsa list of key/value pairs to a list of key/value pairs,optionally specifying conditions requiring that otherkey/value pairs either be present or absent in thesource representation.When developing new coverage for a given lan-guage pair, the developer has two main tasks.
First,they need to add new training examples to thecorpora used to derive the specialised grammarsused for the source and target languages; second,they must add translation rules to handle the newkey/value pairs.
The simple structure of the Med-SLT representations makes it easy to support semi-automatic acquisition of both of these types of in-formation.
The basic principle is to attempt to findthe minimal set of new rules that can be added to theexisting set, in order to cover the new corpus exam-ple; this is done through a short elicitation dialoguewith the developer.
We illustrate this with a simpleexample.Suppose we are developing coverage for the En-glish ?
Spanish version of the system, and thatthe English corpus sentence ?does the pain occur atnight?
fails to translate.
The acquisition tool firstnotes that processing fails when converting from in-terlingua to Spanish.
The interlingua representationis[[utterance_type,ynq],[pronoun,you],[state,have_symptom],[symptom,pain],[tense,present],[prep,in_time],[time,night]]Applying Interlingua ?
Spanish rules, the result is[[utterance_type,ynq],[pronoun,usted],[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],[tense,present],[prep,por_temporal],failed:[time,night]]where the tag failed indicates that the element[time,night] could not be processed.
The toolmatches the incomplete transferred representationagainst a set of correctly translated examples, andshows the developer the English and Spanish stringsfor the three most similar ones, heredoes it appear in the morning-> tiene el dolor por la man?anadoes the pain appear in the morning-> tiene el dolor por la man?anadoes the pain come in the morning-> tiene el dolor por la man?anaThis suggests that a translation for ?does the painoccur at night?
consistent with the existing ruleswould be ?tiene el dolor por la noche?.
The devel-oper gives this example to the system, which parsesit using both the general Spanish resource grammarand the specialised grammar used for generation inthe headache domain.
The specialised grammar failsto produce an analysis, while the resource grammarproduces two analyses,[[utterance_type,ynq],[pronoun,usted],[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],[[utterance_type,ynq],[pronoun,you],[state,have_symptom],[tense,present],[symptom,headache],[sc,when],[[clause,[[utterance_type,dcl],[pronoun,you],[action,drink],[tense,present],[cause,coffee]]]]Figure 1: Representation of ?do you get headaches when you drink coffee?
[tense,present],[prep,por_temporal],[temporal,noche]]and[[utterance_type,dcl],[pronoun,usted],[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],[tense,present],[prep,por_temporal],[temporal,noche]]The first of these corresponds to the YN-questionreading of the sentence (?do you have the pain atnight?
), while the second is the declarative reading(?you have the pain at night?).
Since the first (YN-question) reading matches the Interlingua represen-tation better, the acquisition tool assumes that it isthe intended one.
It can now suggest two pieces ofinformation to extend the system?s coverage.First, it adds the YN-question reading of ?tieneel dolor por la noche?
to the corpus used to trainthe specialised generation grammar.
The pieceof information acquired from this example is that[temporal,noche] should be realised in thisdomain as ?la noche?.
Second, it compares the cor-rect Spanish representation with the incomplete oneproduced by the current set of rules, and induces anew Interlingua to Spanish translation rule.
This willbe of the form[time,night] -> [temporal,noche]In the demo, we will show how the developmentenvironment makes it possible to quickly add newcoverage to the system, while also checking that oldcoverage is not broken.ReferencesP.
