A PROPER TREATMEMT OF SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS IN MACHINE TRANSLATION?oshihiko Nitta, Atsushi Okajima, Hiroyuki Kaji,Youichi Hidano, Koichiro IshiharaSystems Development Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd.1099 Ohzenji Asao-ku, Kawasaki-shi, 215 JAPANABSTRACTA proper treatment of syntax and semantics inmachine translation is introduced and discussedfrom the empirical viewpoint.
For English-Japanese machine translation, the syntax directedapproach is effective where the Heuristic ParsingModel (HPM) and the Syntactic Role System playimportant roles.
For Japanese-Englishtranslation, the semantics directed approach ispowerful where the Conceptual Dependency Diagram(CDD) and the Augmented Case Marker System (whichis a kind of Semantic Role System) play essentialroles.
Some examples of the difference betweenJapanese sentence structure and English sentencestructure, which is vital to machine translation~are also discussed together with variousinteresting ambiguities.I INTRODUCTIONWe have been studying machine translationbetween Japanese and English for several years.Experiences gained in systems development and inlinguistic data investigation suggest that theessential point in constructing a practicalmachine translation system is in the appropriateblending of syntax directed processing and thesemantics directed processing.In order to clarify the above-mentionedsuggestion, let us compare the characteristics ofthe syntax directed approach with those of thesemantics directed approach.The advantages of the syntax directed approachare as follows:(i) It is not so difficult to construct thenecessary linguistic data for syntax directedprocessors because the majority of these data canbe reconstructed from already established andwell-structured lexical items such as verb patterncodes and parts of speech codes, which areoverflowingly abundant in popular lexicons.
(2) The total number of grammatical rulesnecessary for syntactic processing usually stayswithin a controllable range.
(3) The essential aspects of syntacticprocessing are already well-known, apart fromefficiency problems.The disadvantage of the syntax directedapproach is its insufficient ability to resolvevarious ambiguities inherent in natural languages.On the other hand, the advantages of thesemantics directed approach are as follows:(i) The meaning of sentences or texts can begrasped in a unified form without being affectedby the syntactic variety.
(2) Semantic representation can play a pivotalrole for language transformation and can providea basis for constructing a transparent machinetranslation system, because semantic representa-tion is fairly independent of the differences inlanguage classes.
(3) Consequently, semantics directed internalrepresentation can produce accurate translations.The disadvantages of the semantics directedapproach are as follows:(I) It is not easy to construct a semanticlexicon which covers real world phenomena of areasonably wide range.
The main reason for thisdifficulty is that a well-established andwidely-accepted method of describing semanticsdoes not exist.
(For strongly restrictedstatements or topics, of course, there existwell-elaborated methods such as Montague grammar\[2\], Script and MOP (Memory Organization Packet)theory \[13\], Procedural Semantics \[14\], andSemantic Interlingual Representation \[15\].
)(2) The second but intractable problem is that,even if you could devise a fairly acceptablemethod to describe semantics, the total number ofsemantic rule descriptions may expand beyond allmanageable limits.Therefore, we think that it is necessary toseek proper combinations of syntactic processingand semantic processing so as to compensate forthe disadvantages of each.The purpose of this paper is to propose aproper treatment of syntax and semantics inmachine translation systems from a heuristicviewpoint, together with persuasive examplesobtained through operating experiences.
Asub-language approach which would put somemoderate restrictions on the syntax and semanticsof source language is also discussed.159II SYNTAX AND SEMANTICSIt is not entirely possible to distinguish asyntax directed approach from a semanticsdirected approach, because syntax and semanticsare always performing their linguistic functionsreciprocally?As Wilks \[16\] points out, it is plausible but agreat mistake to identify syntactic processingwith superficial processing, or to identifysemantic processing with deep processing.
Theterm "superficial" or "deep" only reflects theintuitive distance from the language represen-tation in (superficial) character strings or fromthe language representation in our (deep) minds.Needless to say, machine translation inevitablyhas something to do with superficial processing?In various aspects of natural languageprocessing, it is quite common to segment asuperficial sentence into a collection of phrases?A phrase itself is a collection of words?
Inorder to restructure the collection of phrases,the processor must first of all attach some sortsof labels to the phrases?
If these labels aresomething like subject, object, complement, etc.,then we will call this processor a syntax directedprocessor, and if these labels are something likeagent, object, instrument, etc., or animate,inanimate, concrete, abstract, human, etc., thenwe will call this processor a semantics directedprocessor?The above definition is oversimplified and ofcourse incomplete, but it is still enough for thearguments in this paper?III SYNTAX DIRECTED APPROACH:A PROTOTYPE ENGLISH-JAPANESEMACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMSo far we have developed two prototype machinetranslation systems; one is for English-Japanesetranslation \[6\] and the other is for Japanese-English translation?The prototype model system for English-Japanese translation (Figure I) is constructed asa syntax directed processor using a phrasestructure type internal representation called HPM(Heuristic Parsing Model), where the semantics isutilized to disambiguate dependency relationships?The somewhat new name HPM (Heuristic ParsingModel) reflects the parsing strategy by which themachine translation tries to simultate theheuristic way of actual human of languagetranslation?
The essential features of heuristictranslation are summarized in the following threesteps:(I) To segment an input sentence into phrasalelements (PE) and clausal elements (CE).
(2) To assign syntactic roles to PE's and CE's,and restructure the segmented elements intotree-forms by governing relation, and intolink-forms by modifying relation?
(3) To permute the segmented elements, and toassign appropriate Japanese equivalents withnecessary case suffixes and postpositions.Noteworthy findings from operationalexperience and efforts to improve the prototypemodel are as follows:Lexicons \[7\]entry:?

SE: Sentence?
This sample English sentence is taken from Datamation Jan. 1982.Figure 2 An Example of Phrase Structure Type Representation(I) The essential structure of English sentencesshould be grasped by phrase structure typerepresentations.An example of phrase strucure typerepresentation, which we call HPM (HeuristicParsing Model), is illustrated in Figure 2.
InFigure 2, a parsed tree is composed of twosubstructures.
One is "tree ( ~/  ),"representing a compulsory dependency relation,and the other is "link (k~) , "  representing anoptional dependency relation.
Each nodecorresponds to a certain constituent of thesentence.The most important constituent is a "phrasalelement (PE)" which is composed of one or moreword element(s) and carries a part of thesentential meaning in the smallest possibleform.
PE's are mutually exclusive.
In Figure 2,PE's are shown by using the "segmenting marker(T)", such asTWith some help (ADVL)\[,\[from overseas (ADJV)\[jT,(co~)T,Tthe Japanese (SUBJ)TandTare beginning (GOV)T,where the terminologies in parentheses are thesyntactic roles which will be discussed later.A "clausal element (CE)" is composed of one ormore PE('s) which carries a part of sententialmeaning in a nexus-like form.
A CE roughlycorresponds to a Japanese simple sentence suchas: "%{wa/ga/wo/no/ni} ~ {suru/dearu} \[koto\].
"CE's allow mutual intersection.
Typical examplesare the underlined parts in the following:"It is important for you to do so.""...
intended to yield a fifth generation system.
"One interesting example in Figure 2 may be thepart"With some help from overseas",which is treated as only two consecutive phrasalelements.
This is the typical result of a syntaxdirected parser.
In the case of a semanticsdirected parser, the above-mentioned part will betreated as a clausal element.
This is becausethe meaning of this part is "(by) getting somehelp from overseas" or the like, which is ratherclausal than phrasal.
(2) Syntax directed processors are effective andpowerful to get phrase structure type parsedtrees.Our HPM parser operates both in a top-down wayglobally and in a bottom-up way locally.
Anexample of top-down operation would be thesegmentation of an input sentence (i.e.
thesequence of word elements (WE's)) to get phrasalelements (PE), and an example of bottom-upoperation would be the construction of tree-formsor link-forms to get clausal elements (CE) or asentence (SE).
These operations are supported bysyntax directed grammatical data such asverb dependency type codes (cf.
Table i, which isa simplified version of Hornby's classification\[5\]), syntactic role codes (Table 2) and someproduction rule type grammars (Table 3 & Table4).
It may be permissible to say that all thesesyntactic data are fairly compact and the kernelparts are already well-elaborated (cf.
\[i\], \[8\],\[ii\], \[12\]).161CodeVlV2V3V6V7V8V14CodeSUBJOK/TOOBJNAPPGOVTOGOVENGOVADJVENADjADVLSENTTable 1 Dependency Pattern of VerbVerb PatternBe + ...Vi (# Be) + Complement,It/There + Vi + ...Vi \[+ Adverbial Modifier\]Vt + To-infinitiveVt + Objectvt + that + ...Vt + Object \[+not\] +To-infinitiveExamplesbeget, lookrise~ walkintendbegin~ yieldagree, thinkknow, bringTable 2 Syntactic RolesRoleSubjectObjectObject in To-infinitive FormNoun in AppositionGoverning VerbGoverning Verb in To-infinitive FormGoverning Verb in Past Participle FormAdjectivalAdjectival in Past Participle FormAdverbialSentence(3) The weak point of syntax directed processorsis their insufficient ability to disambiguate;i.e.
the ability to identify dependency types ofverb phrases and the ability to determine headsof prepositional phrase modifiers.
(4) In order to boost the aforementioneddisambiguation power, it is useful to applysemantic filters that facilitate the selectiverestrictions on linking a verb with nominals andon linking a modifier with its head.A typical example of the semantic filter isillustrated in Figure 3.
The semantic filter mayoperate along with selective restriction rulessuch as:?

* X~_.. Y implies that X Js modified by Y.Figure 3 A Typical Operation of Semantic Filter(5) The aforementioned semantic filters arecompatible with syntax directed processors; i.e.there is no need to reconstruct processors or tomodify internal representations.
It is onlynecessary to add filtrating programs to thesyntax directed processor.One noteworthy point is that the thesaurus forcontrolling the semantic fields or semanticfeatures of words should be constructed in anappropriate form (such as word hierarchy) so asto avoid the so-called combinatorial explosion ofthe number of selective restriction rules.
(6) For the Japaneses  sentence  generat ingprocess ,  it may be necessary  to dev ise  a verycomplicated semantic processor if a system toproduce natural idiomatic Japanese sentences isdesired.
But the majority of Japanese users maytolerate awkward word-by-word translation andunderstand its meaning.
Thus we have concludedthat our research efforts should give priority tothe syntax directed analysis of Englishsentences.
The semantics directed generation ofJapanese sentences might not be an urgent issue;rather it should be treated as a kind of profoundbasic science to be studied without haste.
(7) Even though the output Japanese translationmay be an awkward word-by-word translation, itshould be composed of pertinent function wordsand proper equivalents for content words.Otherwise it could not express the proper meaningof the input English sentences.
(8) In order to select proper equivalents,semantic filters can be applied fairlyeffectively to test the agreement among thesemantic codes assigned to words (or phrases).Again the semantic filter is not alwayscomplete.
For example, in Figure 2, the verb"yield" has at least two different meanings (andconsequently has at least two different Japaneseequ iva lents ) :"yield"-->I"produce" (ffi Umidasu)\["concede" (ffi Yuzuru).But it is neither easy nor certain how todevise a filter to distinguish the above twomeanings mechanically.
Thus we need some humanaids such as post-editing and inter-editing.
(9) As for the pertinent selection of functionwords such as postpositions, there are no formalcomputational rules to perform it.
So we mustfind and store heuristic rules empirically andthen make proper use of them.Some heruistic rules to select appropriateJapanese postpositions are shown in Table 5.Table 5 Heuristic Rules for SelectingPostpositions for "in + N"Semantic Japanese Post-positions forCategory of N ADVL/ADJVin+Nl (NlfPlace) Nl+de/Nl+niokeruin+N3 (N3=Time) N3+ni/N3+noin+N3&N4 -- /N3&Nd+go-ni(Nd=Quantit~)in+N6 N6?dewa/N6+no(N6fAbstractConcept)in+N8 (N8ffiMeans) NS+de/NS+niyoru?

Figure 2).
(Ii) A practical machine translation should beconsidered from a kind of heuristic viewpointrather than from a purely rigid analyticallinguistic viewpoint.
One persuasive reason forthis is the fact that humans, even foreignlanguage learners, can translate fairly difficultEnglish sentences without going into the detailsof parsing problems.IV SEMANTICS DIRECTED APPROACH:A PROTOTYPE JAPANESE-ENGLISHMACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMThe pro to type  model system for  Japanese-Eng l i sh  t rans la t ion  i s  const ruc ted  as a semant icsd i rec ted  processor  us ing  a conceptua l  dependencydiagram as the internal representation.Noteworthy findings through operationalexperience and efforts to improve on theprototype model are as follows:163(I) Considering some of the characteristics ofthe Japanese language, such as flexible wordordering and ambiguous usage of function words,it is not advantageous to adopt a syntax directedrepresentation for the internal base of languagetransformation.For example, the following five Japanesesentences have almost the same meaning except forword ordering and a subtle nuance.
Lowercaseletters represent function words.Boku wa Fude de Tegami wo Kaku.
(11 (brush)(with)(letter) (write)Boku wa tegami wo Fude de Kaku.Fude de Boku wa Tegami wo Kaku.Tegami wa Boku wa Fude de Kaku.Boku wa Tegami wa Fude de Kaku.
(2) Therefore we have decided to adopt theconceptual dependency diagram (CDD) as a compactand powerful semantics directed internalrepresentation.Our idea of the CDD is similar to thewell-known dependency grammar defined by Hays\[4\] and Robinson \[9\] \[i0\], except for theaugmented case markers which play essentiallysemantic roles.
(31 The conceptual dependency diagram forJapanese sentences is composed of predicatephrase nodes (PPNs in abbreviationl and nominalphrase nodes (NTNs in abbreviation).
Each PPNgoverns a few NPNs as its dependants.
Even amongPPNs there exist some governor-dependantrelationships.Examples of formal CDD description are:PPN (NPNI, NPN2, ... N-PNnl,Kaku (Boku, Te~ami, Fude),Write (I, Letter, Brus--~'~,where the underlined word "~' represents the mconcept code corresponding to the superficialword "a", and the augmented case markers areomitted.In the avove description, the order ofdependants NI, N2, ..., Nn are to be neglected.For example,PPN (NPNn, ..., NPN2, NPNI)is identical to the above first formula.
Thisconvention may be different from the one definedby Hays \[4\].
Our convention was introduced tocope with the above-mentioned flexible wordordering in Japanese sentences.
(4) The aforementioned dependency relationshipscan be represented as a linking topology, whereeach link has one governor node and one dependantnode as its top and bottom terminal point (Figure4).
(5) The links are labeled with case markers.Our case marker system is obtained by augmentingthe traditional case markers such as Fillmore's\[3\] from the standpoint of machine translation.For the PPN-NPN link, its label usuallyrepresents agent, object, goal, location, topic,etc.
For the PPN-PPN link, its label is usuallyrepresent causality, temporality,restrictiveness, etc.
(cf.
Figure 4).PPN'PPN ~'C4  --~ Kaku Write __  -~ .

(7) The reason for the large number of optionalcase markers is that the detailed classificationof optional cases is very useful for making anappropriate selection of prepositions andparticiples (Table 7).
(g) Each NPN is to be labeled with some properlyselected semantic features which are under thecontrol of a thesaurus type lexicon.
Semanticfeatures are effective to disambiguatepredicative dependency so as to produce anappropriate English verb phrase.
(9) The essential difference between a Japanesesentence and the equivalent English sentence canbe grasped as the difference in the mode of PPNselections, taken from the viewpoint ofconceptual dependency diagram (Figure 51.
Oncean appropriate PPN selection is made, it will berather simple and mechanical to determine therest of the dependency topology.
(I0) Thus the essential task of Japanese-Englishtranslation can be reduced to the task ofconstructing the rules for transforming thedependency topology by changing PPNs, whilepreserving the meaning of the original dependencytopology (cf.
Figure 5).
(Ill All the aforementioned findings havesomething to do with the semantic directedapproach.
Once the English oriented conceptualdependency diagram is obtained, the rest of thetranslation process is rather syntactic.
Thatis, the phrase structure generation can easily behandled with somewhat traditional syntax directedprocessors.164(12) As is well known, the Japanese language hasa very high degree of complexity and ambiguitymainly caused by frequent ellipsis and functionalmultiplicity, which creates serious obstacles forthe achievement of a totally automatic treatmentof "raw" Japanese sentences.
(ex i) "Sakana wa Taberu.
"(fish) (eat)has at least two different interpretations:?
"\[Sombody\] can eat a fish.".
"The fish may eat \[something\].

The essentialrestrictions given by the sub-language should beconcerned with the usage of function words andsentential embeddings.Table 7 Detailed Classification of Optional CaseMarkers for Modification (subset only)Phase Code Most-Likely Prepositions or ParticiplesFTDPIOVUSBAALHABSEWI?..fromto, tillduringatin, insideout, outsideover, aboveunder, belowbes idebefore, in front ofafter, behindalongthroughover, superior toapart fromwithin.

Our conclusions are as follows:(i) In order to construct a practicalEnglish-Japanese machine translation system, itis advantageous to take the syntax directedapproach, in which a syntactic role system playsa central role, together with phrase structuretype internal representation (which we call HPM).
(2) In English-Japanese machine translation,syntax should be treated in a heuristic mannerbased on actual human translation methods.Semantics plays an assistant role indisambiguating the dependency among phrases.
(3) In English-Japanese machine translation, anoutput Japanese sentence can be obtained directlyfrom the internal phrase structure representation(HPM) which is essentially a structured set ofsyntactic roles.
Output sentences from the aboveare, of course, a kind of literal translation ofstilted style, but no doubt they areunderstandable enough for practical use.
(4) In order to construct a practicalJapanese-English machine translation system, itis advantageous to take the approach in whichsemantics plays a central role together withconceptual dependency type internalrepresentation (which we call CDD).
(5) In Japanese-English machine translation,augmented case markers play a powerful semanticro le.
(6) In Japanese-English machine translation, theessential part of language transformation betweenJapanese and English can be performed in terms ofchanging dependency diagrams (CDD) which involvespredicate replacements.One further problem concerns establishing apractical method of compensating a machinetranslation system for its mistakes orlimitations caused by the intractablecomplexities inherent to natural languages.
Thisproblem may be solved through the concept ofsublanguage, pre-editing and post-editing tomodify source/target languages.
The sub-Japaneselanguage approach in particular seems to beeffective for Japanese-English machinetranslaton.
One of our current interests is in aproper treatment of syntax and semantics in thesublanguage approach.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank Prof. M. Nagao of KyotoUniversity and Prof. H.
