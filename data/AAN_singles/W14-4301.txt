Proceedings of the SIGDIAL 2014 Conference, page 1,Philadelphia, U.S.A., 18-20 June 2014. c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsKeynote: Statistical Approaches to Open-domainSpoken Dialogue SystemsSteve YoungCambridge University, UKsjy@eng.cam.ac.ukIn contrast to traditional rule-based approaches to building spokendialogue systems, recent research has shown that it is possible to imple-ment all of the required functionality using statistical models trainedusing a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning.This approach to spoken dialogue is based on the mathematics of par-tially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in which userinputs are treated as observations of some underlying belief state, andsystem responses are determined by a policy which maps belief statesinto actions.Virtually all current spoken dialogue systems are designed to op-erate in either a specific carefully defined domain such as restaurantinformation and appointment booking, or they have very limited con-versational ability such as in Siri and Google Now.
However, if voice isto become a significant input modality for accessing web-based infor-mation and services, then techniques will be needed to enable conver-sational spoken dialogue systems to operate within open domains.This talk will discuss methods by which current statistical approachesto spoken dialogue can be extended to cover much wider domains.
Itwill be argued that unlike many other areas of machine learning, spokendialogue systems always have a user on-hand to provide supervision.Hence spoken dialogue systems provide a unique opportunity to auto-matically adapt on large quantities of speech data without the need forcostly annotation.1
