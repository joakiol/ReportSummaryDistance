jpAbstractIn this paper, we first experimentally investigatedthe factors that make extracts hard to read.
We didthis by having human subjects try to revise extractsto produce more readable ones.
We then classifiedthe factors into five, most of which are related tocohesion, after which we devised revision rnles foreach factor, and partially implemented a system thatrevises extracts.1 In t roduct ionThe increasing number of on-line texts available hasresulted in automatic text summarization becom-iI,g a major research topic in the NLP community.The main approach is to extract important sentencesfiom the texts, and the main task in this approachis: that of evaluating the importance of sentences\[MIT, 1999\].
This producing of extracts - that is,sets of extracted important sentences - is thought obe easy, and has therefore long been the main waythat texts are summarized.
As Paice pointed out,however, computer-produced extracts tend to sufferfrom a 'lack of cohesion' \[Paice, 1990\].
For example,the antecedents corresponding to anaphors in an ex-tract are not always included in the extract.
Thisoften makes tile extracts hard to read.In the work described in this paper, we there-fore developed a method for making extracts easierto read by revising them.
We first experimentallyinvestigated the factors that make extracts hard toread.
We did this by having human subjects try torevise extracts to produce more readable ones.
Wethen classified the factors into five, most of whichare related to cohesion \[Halliday et al, 1976\], afterwhich we devised revision rules tbr each factor, andpartially implemented a system that revises extract-s. We then evaluated our system by comparing itsrevisions with those produced by human subjectsand also by comparing the readability judgments ofhuman subjects between the revised and original ex--tracts.In tile following sections we briefly review relat-ed works, describe our investigation of what makeextracts hard to read, and explain our system forrevising extracts to make tl~em more readable.
Fi-nally, we describe our evaluation of the system anddiscuss the results of that evaluation.2 Re la ted  WorksMany investigators have tried to measure the read-ability of texts \[Klare, 1963\].
Most of them have e--valuated well-formed texts produced by people, andused two measures: percentage of familiar words inthe texts (word level) and the average length of thesentences in the texts (syntactic level).
These mea-sures, however, do not necessarily reflect the actu-al readability of computer-produced xtracts.
Wetherefore have to take into account other factors thatmight reduce the readability of extracts.One of them could be a lack of cohesion.
Italli-day and ttasan \[ttalliday et al, 1976\] described fivekinds of cohesion: reference, substitution, ellipsis,conjunction, and lexical cohesion.Minel \[Minel et al, 1997\] tried to measure thereadability of extracts in two ways: by counting thenumber of anaphors in an extract that do not haveantecedents in the extract, and by counting the num-ber of sentences which are not included in an extractbut closely connected to sentences in the extract.We therefore regard kinds of cohesion as impor-tant in trying to classify tile factors that make ex-tracts less readable in the next section.One of the notable previous works dealing withways to produce more cohesive extracts is thatof Paiee \[Paiee, 1990\].
Mathis presented a frame-work in which a pair of short sentences are com-bined into one to yield a more readable extract\[Mathis et al, 197,3\].
We think, however, that noneof the previous tudies have adequately investigatedthe factors making extracts hard to read.Some investigators have compared human-produced abstracts with the original texts and inves-tigated how people revise texts to produce abstracts1071\[Kawahara, 1989, Jing, 1999\].
Revision is thought obe done for (at least) the following three purposes:(1) to shorten texts,(2) to change the style of texts,(3) to make texts more readable.J ing \[aing, 1999\] is trying to implement a humansummarizat ion model that includes two revision op-erations: reduction (1) and combinat ion (3).
Mani\[Mani et al, 1999\] proposed a revision system thatuses three operations: el imination (1), aggregation(1), and smoothing (1, 3).
Mani showed that hissystem can make extracts more informative with-out degrading their readabi l i ty.
The present work,however, is concerned not with improving readabi l i -ty but with improving the informativeness.3 Less Readabi l i ty  of ExtractsTo investigate the revision of extracts exper imental -ly, we had 12 graduate students produce extractsof 25 newspaper articles from the NIHON KE IZA ISHINBUN, the average length of which was 30 sen-tences.
We then asked them to revise the extracts(six subjects per extract) .We obtained extracts containing 343 revisions,made for any of the three purposes l isted in the lastsection.
We selected the revisions for readabi l i ty,and classified them into 5 categories, by taking intoaccount the categories of cohesion by Hal l iday andHasan\[Hal l iday et al, 1976\].
Table 1 shows the sumof the investigation.Next, we i l lustrate each category of revisions.
Inthe examples, darkened sentences are those that arenot included in extracts,  but are shown for explana-tion.
The serial number in the original text is alsoshown at the beginning of sentences aA)  Lack  o f  con junct ive  express ions /presenceo f  ext raneous  con junct ive  express ionsThe relation between sentences 15 and 16 is ad-versative, because there is a conjunctive 'L.
b ' \ [ l(However)'  at the beginning of sentence 16.
Butbecause sentence 15 is not in the extract,  ' L  h 'L(However)'  is considered unnecessary and should bedeleted.
Conversely, lack of conjunctive xpression-s might cause the relation between sentences to bedifficult to understand.
In such a case, a suitableconjunctive expression should be added.
For thesetasks, discourse structure analyzer is required.We use the following three tags to show revisions.< ,,t,~ > F,~ < I ,aa  >: add a new expression ~.< ,~t > B z < In,4 >: delete an expression ~..< , , I ,  ~t  > t% < / r , r  >: replace an expression ~3 with B41(The company plans to give women more opportu-nity to work by employing fidl-time workers.)15.

In this example, the anaphoric expression'\[iiJ ~1: (the eoinpany) '  is used instead of the originalexpression.1072Table 1: Factors of less readabil ity and their revision methods~ factors-A--B syntactic omplexityClack of conjunctive expressions/presence of extraneousconjunctive xpressionsredundant repetitionlack of informationrevision methodsadd/delete conjunctive expressionscombine two sentences; divide a sentence into twoprononfinalizei onfit expressions;add demonstrativessupplement omitted expressions;replace anaphors by antecedents; delete anaphorsrequired techniquesdiscourse structureanalysisanaphora ndellipsis resolutionadd supplementary information information extractionlack of adverbial particles; add/delete adverbial particlespresence of extraneousadverbial particlesD) Lack  of  in fo rmat ion~:' :,.-- Y--25.

In such a case, there are twoways to revise: to replace the anaphoric expressionwith its antecedent, or to delete the expression.
There.vision in the example is the latter one.
For thetask, a method for anaphora nd ellipsis resolutionis required.

Therefore, the name of the company 'Softbank'should be added as the supplementary information.The task requires a method for information extrac-tion or at least named entity extraction.E) lack  of  adverb ia l  par t i c les /presence  ofext raneous  adverb ia l  par t i c les'2,6.

)In the above example, there is an adverbial parti-cle "5 (, too)' and we can find that sentences 29 and30 are paratactical.
But, because sentence 29 is notin the extract, the particle '-L (, too)' is unnecessaryand should be deleted.4 Rev is ion  SystemOur system uses the Japanese publ ic-domain an-alyzers JUMAN \[Kurohashi et al, 1998\] and KNP\[t(urohashi, 1998\] morphologically and syntactical lyanalyze an original newspaper article and its extrac-t.
It then applies revisions rules to the extract re-peatedly, with reference to the original text, unti l  norules can revise the extract further.4.1 Revision RulesBecause tile techniques needed for dealing with allthe categories of revisions dealt with in the previous1073section were not available, we devised and imple-mented revision rules only for factors (A), (C), and(D) in Table 1 by using JPerl.a) Delet ion of  con junct ive  xpressionsWe prepared a list of 52 conjunctive expres-sions, and made it a rule to delete each of themwhenever the extract does not include the sentencethat expression is related.
To identify the sen-tence related to the sentence by the conjunction\[Mann et al, 1986\], the system performs partial dis-course structure analysis taking into account all sen-tences within three sentences of the one containingthe conjunctive xpression.The implementation of our partial discoursestructure analyzer was based on Fukumoto's dis-course structure analyzer \[Fukumoto, 1990\].
It in-fers the relationship between two sentences by refer-ring to the conjunctive xpressions, topical words,and demonstrative words.c) Omission of  redundant  expressionsIf subjects (or topical expressions marked withtopical postposition 'wa') of adjacent sentences inan extract were the same, the repeated expressionswere considered redundant and were deleted.d - l )  Delet ion of  anaphorsTo treat anaphora nd ellipsis successfully, wewould need a mechanism for anaphora nd ellipsisresolution (finding the antecedents and omitted ex-pressions).
Because we have no such mechanism,we implement a rule with ad hoc heuristics: If ananaphor appears at the beginning of a sentence inan extract, its antecedent must be in the precedingsentence.
Therefore, if that sentence was not in theextract, the anaphor was deleted.d-2) Supp lement  of  omi t ted  subjectsIf a subject in a sentence in an extract is omit-ted, the revision rule supplements he subject fromthe nearest preceding sentence whose subject is notomitted in the original text.
This rule is implement-ed by using heuristics imilar to the above revisionrule.5 Eva luat ion  o f  Rev is ion  Sys-temWe evaluated our revision system by comparing itsrevisions with those by human subjects (evaluation1), and comparing readability judgments betweenthe revised and original extracts (evaluation 2).5.1 Eva luat ion  1: compar ing  sys temrev is ions  and  human rev is ionsBecause revision is a subjective task, it was not easyto prepare an answer set of revisions to which oursystem's revisions could be compared.
The revisionsthat more subjects make, however, can be consid-ered more reliable and more likely to be necessary.When comparing the revisions made by our systemwith those made by human subjects, we thereforetook into account the degree of agreement amongsubjects.For this evaluation, we used 31 newspaper ar-ticles (NIHON KEIZAI SHINBUN) and their ex-tracts.
They were different from the articles usedfor making rules.
Fifteen of extracts are taken fronlNomoto's work \[Nomoto et al, 1997\], and the restwere made by our group.
The average numbers ofsentences in the original articles and the extractswere 25.2 and 5.1.Each extract was revised by five subjects whohad been instructed to revise the extracts to makethem more readable and had been shown the 5 ex-amples in section 3.
As a result, we obtained 167revisions in total.
The results are listed in Table 2.Table 2: The number of revisionsI \]revision methods I total IA add(61)/delete(ll)conjunctive xpressions 72B combine two sentences(2)divide a sentence into two(6) 8C pronominalize(5); omit expressions(3)add demonstratives(8) 16D supplement omitted expressions(lI)replace anaphors by antecedents(10)delete anaphors(15) 36add supplementary information(26) 26E delete adverbial particles(4)add adverbial particles(5) 9167We compared our system's revisions with the an-swer set comprising revisions that more than twosubjects made.
And we used recall (R) and preci~sion (P) as measures of the system's performances.
( Numberofsystem'srevisions )matched to the answerR= Number of revisions in the answer( Number ofsystem'srevisions )matched to the answerP= Number of systemfs revisionsEvaluation results are listed in Table 3.
As inTable 3, the coverage of our revision rules is rathersmall (about 1/4) in the whole set of revisions inTable 2.
It is true that the experiment is rather smalland can be considered as less reliable.
Though it isless reliable, some of the implemented rules can covermost of the necessary revisions by human subjects.However, precision should be improved.1074Table 3: Comt)arison between tile revisions by hu-nlan aud our systemre visionrules J\] I-( I P Ia(total:ll) 2/2 2/5c(total:3) 0/0 0/0d-l(total:15) 4/5 4/7d-2(total:ll) II 2/4 2/105.2 Evaluation 2: colnparillg humanreadabil ity judgments of originaland revised extractsIn the second evaluation, using the same 31 textsas in evaluation 1, we asked five human subject-s to rank the following four kinds extracts in theorder of readability: the original extract (withoutrevision)(NON-REV), human-revised ones (REV-1and REV-2), and the one revised by our system(REV-AUTO).
REV-1 and REV-2 were respective-ly extracts revised in the cases where more than oneand more than two subjects agreed to revise.We considered ajudgment by tile majority (morethan two subjects) to be reliable.
The results arelisted in Table 4.
The column 'split' in Table 4 indi-cates the number of cases where no majority couldagree.
The results show that both REV-1 and REV-2 extracts were more readable than NON-REV ex-tracts and that REV-2 extracts might be better thanREV-1 extracts, since the number of 'worse' evalua-tions was smaller for REV-2 extracts.Table 4: Comparison of readability among originalextracts and revised ones\]\] better same \] worse \] splitREV-2vs.

NON \[\[ 2 13 \[ 12 \] 0In comparing REV-AUTO with NON-REV,  weuse 27 texts where the readability does not de-grade in REV-2, since the readability cannot im-prove with revisions by our system in those textswhere the readability degrades even with human re-visions.
Even with those texts, however, in ahnosthalf the cases, the readability of the revised extrac-t was worse than that of the original extract.
Themain reason is that the revision system supplement-ed incorrect subjects.6 D iscuss ionAlthough the results of the evaluation are encour-aging, they also show that our system needs to beimproved.
We have to impleinent inore revision rulesto enlarge the coverage of our system.
One of themost frequent revisions is to add conjunctions(37%).We also need to reform our revision rules into morethorough implementation.
To improve our system,we think it is necessary to develop a robust discoursestructure analyzer, a robust mechanism for anapho-ra and ellipsis resolution, and a robust system ofextracting named entities.
They are under develop-lllent now.7 Conc lus ionIn this paper we described our investigation of thefactors that make extracts less readable than theyshould be.
We had human subjects revise extractsto made them more readable, and we classified thefactors into five categories.
We then devised revisionrules for three of these factors and iinplemented asystem that uses them to revise extracts.
We foundexperimentally that our revision system can improvethe readability of extracts.References\[Fukumoto, 1990\] Fukumoto, J.
