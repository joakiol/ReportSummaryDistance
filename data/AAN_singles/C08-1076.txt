We observe that the dis-tribution of occurrence as well as co-occurrence of the consonants across lan-guages follow a power-law behavior.
Theco-occurrence network of consonants ex-hibits a high clustering coefficient.
Wepropose four novel synthesis models forthese networks (each of which is a refine-ment of the earlier) so as to successivelymatch with higher accuracy (a) the abovementioned topological properties as wellas (b) the linguistic property of featureeconomy exhibited by the consonant inven-tories.
We conclude by arguing that a pos-sible interpretation of this mechanism ofnetwork growth is the process of child lan-guage acquisition.
Such models essentiallyincrease our understanding of the struc-ture of languages that is influenced by theirevolutionary dynamics and this, in turn,can be extremely useful for building futureNLP applications.1 IntroductionA large number of regular patterns are observedacross the sound inventories of human languages.These regularities are arguably a consequence ofthe self-organization that is instrumental in theemergence of these inventories (de Boer, 2000).Many attempts have been made by functional pho-nologists for explaining this self-organizing behav-c?

In fact, there are alot of studies that attempt to explain the emergenceof the vowel inventories through the application ofone or more of the above principles (Liljencrantsand Lindblom, 1972; de Boer, 2000).
Some studieshave also been carried out in the area of linguisticsthat seek to reason the observed patterns in the con-sonant inventories (Trubetzkoy, 1939; Lindblomand Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Clements,2008).
Nevertheless, most of these works are con-fined to certain individual principles rather thanformulating a general theory describing the emer-gence of these regular patterns across the conso-nant inventories.The self-organization of the consonant inven-tories emerges due to an interaction of differentforces acting upon them.
In order to identify thenature of these interactions one has to understandthe growth dynamics of these inventories.
The the-ories of complex networks provide a number ofgrowth models that have proved to be extremelysuccessful in explaining the evolutionary dynam-ics of various social (Newman, 2001; Ramasco etal., 2004), biological (Jeong et al, 2000) and othernatural systems.
The basic framework for the cur-rent study develops around two such complex net-works namely, the Phoneme-Language Networkor PlaNet (Choudhury et al, 2006) and its one-mode projection, the Phoneme-Phoneme Networkor PhoNet (Mukherjee et al2007a).
We begin byanalyzing some of the structural properties (Sec.
2)of the networks and observe that the consonantnodes in both PlaNet and PhoNet follow a power-law-like degree distribution.
Moreover, PhoNet601is characterized by a high clustering coefficient,a property that has been found to be prevalent inmany other social networks (Newman, 2001; Ra-masco et al, 2004).We propose four synthesis models for PlaNet(Sec.
3), each of which employ a variant of a pref-erential attachment (Baraba?si and Albert, 1999)based growth kernel1.
While the first two mod-els are independent of the characteristic proper-ties of the (consonant) nodes, the following twouse them.
These models are successively refinednot only to reproduce the topological properties ofPlaNet and PhoNet, but also to match the linguis-tic property of feature economy (Boersma, 1998;Clements, 2008) that is observed across the conso-nant inventories.
The underlying growth rules foreach of these individual models helps us to inter-pret the cause of the emergence of at least one (ormore) of the aforementioned properties.
We con-clude (Sec.
4) by providing a possible interpreta-tion of the proposed mathematical model that wefinally develop in terms of child language acquisi-tion.There are three major contributions of this work.Firstly, it provides a fascinating account of thestructure and the evolution of the human speechsound systems.
Furthermore, the introduction ofthe node property based synthesis model is a sig-nificant contribution to the field of complex net-works.
On a broader perspective, this work showshow statistical mechanics can be applied in under-standing the structure of a linguistic system, whichin turn can be extremely useful in developing fu-ture NLP applications.2 Properties of the ConsonantInventoriesIn this section, we briefly recapitulate the defi-nitions of PlaNet and PhoNet, the data source,construction procedure for the networks and someof their important structural properties.
We alsorevisit the concept of feature economy and themethod used for its quantification.2.1 Structural Properties of the ConsonantNetworksPlaNet is a bipartite graph G = ?
VL, VC, Epl?
con-sisting of two sets of nodes namely, VL(labeled bythe languages) and VC(labeled by the consonants);1The word kernel here refers to the function or mathemat-ical formula that drives the growth of the network.Figure 1: Illustration of the nodes and edges ofPlaNet and PhoNet.Eplis the set of edges running between VLand VC.There is an edge e ?

Hence, it can be represented by a graphG = ?
VC, Eph?, where VCis the set of conso-nant nodes and Ephis the set of edges connectingthese nodes in G. There is an edge e ?
Ephif thetwo nodes (read consonants) that are connected bye co-occur in at least one language and the numberof languages they co-occur in defines the weight ofthe edge e. Figure 1 shows the nodes and the edgesof PlaNet and PhoNet.Data Source and Network Construction: Likemany other earlier studies (Liljencrants and Lind-blom, 1972; Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; deBoer, 2000; Hinskens and Weijer, 2003), we usethe UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Data-base (UPSID) (Maddieson, 1984) as the source ofour data.
There are 317 languages in the data-base with a total of 541 consonants found acrossthem.
Each consonant is characterized by a set ofphonological features (Trubetzkoy, 1931), whichdistinguishes it from others.
UPSID uses articula-tory features to describe the consonants, which canbe broadly categorized into three different typesnamely the manner of articulation, the place ofarticulation and phonation.
Manner of articu-lation specifies how the flow of air takes placein the vocal tract during articulation of a conso-nant, whereas place of articulation specifies theactive speech organ and also the place where itacts.
Phonation describes the vibration of the vo-602Manner of Articulation Place of Articulation Phonationtap velar voicedflap uvular voicelesstrill dentalclick palatalnasal glottalplosive bilabialr-sound alveolarfricative retroflexaffricate pharyngealimplosive labial-velarapproximant labio-dentalejective stop labial-palatalaffricated click dental-palatalejective affricate dental-alveolarejective fricative palato-alveolarlateral approximantTable 1: The table shows some of the importantfeatures listed in UPSID.
Over 99% of the UPSIDlanguages have bilabial, dental-alveolar and velarplosives.
Furthermore, voiceless plosives outnum-ber the voiced ones (92% vs. 67%).
93% of thelanguages have at least one fricative, 97% have atleast one nasal and 96% have at least one liquid.Approximants occur in fewer than 95% of the lan-guages.cal cords during the articulation of a consonant.Apart from these three major classes there are alsosome secondary articulatory features found in cer-tain languages.
There are around 52 features listedin UPSID; the important ones are noted in Table 1.Note that in UPSID the features are assumed to bebinary-valued and therefore, each consonant canbe represented by a binary vector.We have used UPSID in order to constructPlaNet and PhoNet.
Consequently, |VL| = 317 (inPlaNet) and |VC| = 541.
The number of edges inPlaNet and PhoNet are 7022 and 30412 respec-tively.Degree Distributions of PlaNet and PhoNet:The degree distribution is the fraction of nodes, de-noted by Pk, which have a degree2 greater than orequal to k (Newman, 2003).
The degree distribu-tion of the consonant nodes in PlaNet and PhoNetare shown in Figure 2 in the log-log scale.
Both theplots show a power-law behavior (Pk?

withexponential cut-offs towards the ends.
The valueof ?
is 0.71 for PlaNet and 0.89 for PhoNet.Clustering Coefficient of PhoNet: The clus-tering coefficient for a node i is the proportion oflinks between the nodes that are the neighbors ofi divided by the number of links that could pos-sibly exist between them (Newman, 2003).
SincePhoNet is a weighted graph the above definition is2For a weighted graph like PhoNet, the degree of a node iis the sum of weights on the edges that are incident on i.suitably modified by the one presented in (Barratet al, 2004).
According to this definition, the clus-tering coefficient for a node i is,ci=1(??jwij)(ki?

The clustering coefficient of thenetwork (cav) is equal to the average clustering co-efficient of the nodes.
The value of cavfor PhoNetis 0.89, which is significantly higher than that of arandom graph with the same number of nodes andedges (0.08).2.2 Linguistic Properties: Feature Economyand its QuantificationThe principle of feature economy states that lan-guages tend to use a small number of distinctivefeatures and maximize their combinatorial pos-sibilities to generate a large number of conso-nants (Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2008).
Stateddifferently, a given consonant will have a higherthan expected chance of occurrence in invento-ries in which all of its features have already dis-tinctively occurred in the other consonants.
Thisprinciple immediately implies that the consonantschosen by a language should share a considerablenumber of features among them.
The quantifica-tion process, which is a refinement of the idea pre-sented in (Mukherjee et al2007b), is as follows.Feature Entropy: For an inventory of size N ,let there be pfconsonants for which a particularfeature f (recall that we assume f to be binary-valued) is present and qfother consonants forwhich the same is absent.
Therefore, the proba-bility that a consonant (chosen uniformly at ran-dom from this inventory) contains the feature f ispfNand the probability that it does not contain thefeature is qfN(=1?pfN).
One can think of f as an in-dependent random variable, which can take values1 and 0, and pfNand qfNdefine the probability dis-tribution of f .
Therefore, for any given inventory,we can define the binary entropy Hf(Shannon andWeaver, 1949) for the feature f asHf= ?pfNlog2pfN?qfNlog2qfN(2)603Figure 2: Degree distribution (DD) of PlaNet alng with that of PlaNetsynobtained from Model I and IIrespectively; (b) DD of PhoNet alng with that of PhoNetsynobtained from Model I and II respectively.Both the plots are in log-log scale.If F is the set of all features present in the conso-nants forming the inventory, then feature entropyFEis the sum of the binary entropies with respectto all the features, that isFE=?f?FHf=?f?F(?pfNlog2pfN?qfNlog2qfN)(3)Since we have assumed that f is an independentrandom variable, FEis the joint entropy of thesystem.
In other words, FEprovides an estimateof the number of discriminative features presentin the consonants of an inventory that a speaker(e.g., parent) has to communicate to a learner (e.g.,child) during language transmission.
The lower thevalue of FEthe higher is the feature economy.
Thecurve marked as (R) in Figure 3 shows the averagefeature entropy of the consonant inventories of aparticular size3 (y-axis) versus the inventory size(x-axis).3 Synthesis ModelsIn this section, we describe four synthesis mod-els that incrementally attempt to explain the emer-gence of the structural properties of PlaNet andPhoNet as well as the feature entropy exhibited bythe consonant inventories.
In all these models, weassume that the distribution of the consonant in-ventory size, i.e., the degrees of the language nodesin PlaNet, are known a priori.3Let there be n inventories of a particular size k. Theaverage feature entropy of the inventories of size k is1n?ni=1FEi, where FEisignifies the feature entropy of theith inventory of size k.3.1 Model I: Preferential Attachment KernelThis model employs a modified version of the ker-nel described in (Choudhury et al, 2006), which isthe only work in literature that attempts to explainthe emergence of the consonant inventories in theframework of complex networks.Let us assume that a language node Li?
VLhas a degree ki.
The consonant nodes in VCareassumed to be unlabeled, i.e, they are not markedby the distinctive features that characterize them.We first sort the nodes L1through L317in the as-cending order of their degrees.
At each time step anode Lj, chosen in order, preferentially attaches it-self with kjdistinct nodes (call each such node Ci)of the set VC.
The probability Pr(Ci) with whichthe node Ljattaches itself to the node Ciis givenby,Pr(Ci) =di?+ ??i??V?C(di?
?+ ?
)(4)where, diis the current degree of the node Ci,V?Cis the set of nodes in VCthat are not alreadyconnected to Lj, ?
is the smoothing parameterthat facilitates random attachments and ?
indi-cates whether the attachment kernel is sub-linear(?
< 1), linear (?
= 1) or super-linear (?
> 1).Note that the modification from the earlier ker-nel (Choudhury et al, 2006) is brought about bythe introduction of ?.
The above process is re-peated until all the language nodes Lj?
VLgetconnected to kjconsonant nodes (refer to Figure.6 of (Choudhury et al, 2006) for an illustration ofthe steps of the synthesis process).
Thus, we have604the synthesized version of PlaNet, which we shallcall PlaNetsynhenceforth.The Simulation Results: We simulate theabove model to obtain PlaNetsynfor 100 differ-ent runs and average the results over all of them.We find that the degree distributions that emergefit the empirical data well for ?
?
[1.4,1.5] and?
?
[0.4,0.6], the best being at ?
= 1.44 and ?
= 0.5(shown in Figure 2).
In fact, the mean error4 be-tween the real and the synthesized distributions forthe best choice of parameters is as small as 0.01.Note that this error in case of the model presentedin (Choudhury et al, 2006) was 0.03.
Furthermore,as we shall see shortly, a super-linear kernel canexplain various other topological properties moreaccurately than a linear kernel.In absence of preferential attachment i.e., whenall the connections to the consonant nodes areequiprobable, the mean error rises to 0.35.A possible reason behind the success of thismodel is the fact that language is a constantlychanging system and preferential attachment playsa significant role in this change.
For instance, dur-ing the change those consonants that belong to lan-guages that are more prevalent among the speak-ers of a generation have higher chances of beingtransmitted to the speakers of the subsequent gen-erations (Blevins, 2004).
This heterogeneity in thechoice of the consonants manifests itself as pref-erential attachment.
We conjecture that the valueof ?
is a function of the societal structure and thecognitive capabilities of human beings.
The exactnature of this function is currently not known anda topic for future research.
The parameter ?
in thiscase may be thought of as modeling the random-ness of the system.Nevertheless, the degree distribution ofPhoNetsyn, which is the one-mode projectionof PlaNetsyn, does not match the real data well(see Figure 2).
The mean error between the twodistributions is 0.45.
Furthermore, the clusteringcoefficient of PhoNetsynis 0.55 and differs largelyfrom that of PhoNet.
The primary reason for thisdeviation in the results is that PhoNet exhibitsstrong patterns of co-occurrences (Mukherjee etal.2007a) and this fact is not taken into accountby Model I.
In order to circumvent the above4Mean error is defined as the average difference betweenthe ordinate pairs (say y and y? )
where the abscissas are equal.In other words, if there are N such ordinate pairs then themean error can be expressed as?|y?y?|N.problem, we introduce the concept of triad (i.e.,fully connected triplet) formation and therebyrefine the model in the following section.3.2 Model II: Kernel based on TriadFormationThe triad model (Peltoma?ki and Alava, 2006)builds up on the concept of neighborhood forma-tion.
Two consonant nodes C1and C2becomeneighbors if a language node at any step of thesynthesis process attaches itself to both C1andC2.
Let the probability of triad formation be de-noted by pt.
At each time step a language nodeLj(chosen from the set of language nodes sortedin ascending order of their degrees) makes the firstconnection preferentially to a consonant node Ci?
VCto which Ljis not already connected fol-lowing the distribution Pr(Ci).
For the rest of the(kj-1) connections Ljattaches itself preferentiallyto only the neighbors of Cito which Ljis not yetconnected with a probability pt.
Consequently, Ljconnects itself preferentially to the non-neighborsof Cito which Ljis not yet connected with a prob-ability (1 ?
pt).
The neighbor set of Cigets up-dated accordingly.
Note that every time the nodeCiand its neighbors are chosen they together im-pose a clique on the one-mode projection.
Thisphenomenon leads to the formation of a large num-ber of triangles in the one-mode projection therebyincreasing the clustering coefficient of the resultantnetwork.The Simulation Results: We carry out 100 dif-ferent simulation runs of the above model for a par-ticular set of parameter values to obtain PlaNetsynand average the results over all of them.
We ex-plore several parameter settings in the range as fol-lows: ?
?
[1,1.5] (in steps of 0.1), ?
?
[0.2,0.4](in steps of 0.1) and pt?
[0.70,0.95] (in steps of0.05).
We also observe that if we traverse any fur-ther along one or more of the dimensions of the pa-rameter space then the results get worse.
The bestresult emerges for ?
= 1.3, ?
= 0.3 and pt= 0.8.Figure 2 shows the degree distribution of theconsonant nodes of PlaNetsynand PlaNet.
Themean error between the two distributions is 0.04approximately and is therefore worse than the re-sult obtained from Model I.
Nevertheless, the aver-age clustering coefficient of PhoNetsynin this caseis 0.85, which is within 4.5% of that of PhoNet.Moreover, in this process the mean error betweenthe degree distribution of PhoNetsynand PhoNet605(as illustrated in Figure 2) has got reduced drasti-cally from 0.45 to 0.03.One can again find a possible association of thismodel with the phenomena of language change.
Ifa group of consonants largely co-occur in the lan-guages of a generation of speakers then it is verylikely that all of them get transmitted together inthe subsequent generations (Blevins, 2004).
Thetriad formation probability ensures that if a pair ofconsonant nodes become neighbors of each otherin a particular step of the synthesis process thenthe choice of such a pair should be highly pre-ferred in the subsequent steps of the process.
Thisis coherent with the aforementioned phenomenonof transmission of consonants in groups over lin-guistic generations.
Since the value of ptthat weobtain is quite high, it may be argued that suchtransmissions are largely prevalent in nature.Although Model II reproduces the structuralproperties of PlaNet and PhoNet quite accurately,as we shall see shortly, it fails to generate inven-tories that closely match the real ones in termsof feature entropy.
However, at this point, recallthat Model II assumes that the consonant nodes areunlabeled; therefore, the inventories that are pro-duced as a result of the synthesis are composed ofconsonants, which unlike the real inventories, arenot marked by their distinctive features.
In orderto label them we perform the following,The Labeling Scheme:1.
Sort the consonants of UPSID in the decreasingorder of their frequency of occurrence and call thislist of consonants ListC[1 ?

Sort the VCnodes of PlaNetsynin decreasingorder of their degree and call this list of nodesListN [1 ?

ListC[i]The Figure 3 indicates that the curve for the realinventories (R) and those obtained from Model II(M2) are significantly different from each other.This difference arises due to the fact that in ModelII, the choice of a consonant from the set of neigh-bors is solely degree-dependent, where the rela-tionships between the features are not taken intoconsideration.
Therefore, in order to eliminate thisproblem, we introduce the model using the feature-based kernel in the next section.3.3 Model III: Feature-based KernelIn this model, we assume that each of the conso-nant nodes are labeled, that is each of them areFigure 3: Average feature entropy of the invento-ries of a particular size (y-axis) versus the inven-tory size (x-axis).marked by a set of distinctive features.
The attach-ment kernel in this case has two components oneof which is preferential while the other favors thechoice of those consonants that are at a low fea-ture distance (the number of feature positions theydiffer at) from the already chosen ones.
Let us de-note the feature distance between two consonantsCiand C ?iby D(Ci, C?i).
We define the affinity,A(Ci, C?i), between Ciand C ?iasA(Ci, C?i) =1D(Ci, C?i)(5)Therefore, the lower the feature distance betweenCiand C ?ithe higher is the affinity between them.At each time step a language node estab-lishes the first connection with a consonant node(say Ci) preferentially following the distributionPr(Ci) like the previous models.
The rest ofthe connections to any arbitrary consonant nodeC?i(not yet connected to the language node) aremade following the distribution (1?w)Pr(C ?i) +wPraff(Ci, C?i), wherePraff(Ci, C?i) =A(Ci, C?i)?
?C?iA(Ci, C?i)(6)and 0 < w < 1.Simulation Results: We perform 100 differentsimulation runs of the above model for a particularset of parameter values to obtain PlaNetsynand av-erage the results over all of them.
We explore dif-ferent parameter settings in the range as follows:?
?
[1,2] (in steps of 0.1), ?
?
[0.1,1] (in stepsof 0.1) and w ?
[0.1,0.5] (in steps of 0.05).
The606best result in terms of the structural properties ofPlaNet and PhoNet emerges for ?
= 1.6, ?
= 0.3and w = 0.2.In this case, the mean error between the de-gree distribution curves for PlaNetsynand PlaNetis 0.05 and that between of PhoNetsynand PhoNetis 0.02.
Furthermore, the clustering coefficient ofPhoNetsynin this case is 0.84, which is within5.6% of that of PhoNet.
The above results showthat the structural properties of the synthesizednetworks in this case are quite similar to thoseobtained through the triad model.
Nevertheless,the average feature entropy of the inventories pro-duced (see curve M3 in Figure 3) are more close tothat of the real ones now (for quantitative compar-ison see Table 2).Therefore, it turns out that the groups of con-sonants that largely co-occur in the languagesof a linguistic generation are actually driven bythe principle of feature economy (see (Clements,2008; Mukherjee et al2007a) for details).However, note that even for Model III the nodesthat are chosen for attachment in the initial stagesof the synthesis process are arbitrary and conse-quently, the labels of the nodes of PlaNetsyndonot have a one-to-one correspondence with that ofPlaNet, which is the main reason behind the differ-ence in the result between them.
In order to over-come this problem we can make use of a small setof real inventories to bootstrap the model.3.4 Model IV: Feature-based Kernel andBootstrappingIn order to create a bias towards the labelingscheme prevalent in PlaNet, we use 30 (around10% of the) real languages as a seed (chosen ran-domly) for Model III; i.e., they are used by themodel for bootstrapping.
The idea is summarizedbelow.1.
Select 30 real inventories at random and con-struct a PlaNet from them.
Call this network theinitial PlaNetsyn.2.
The rest of the language nodes are incrementallyadded to this initial PlaNetsynusing Model III.Simulation Results: The best fit now emergesat ?

Hence, we findthat this improved labeling strategy brings abouta global betterment in our results unlike in the pre-vious cases.
The larger the number of languagesused for the purpose of bootstrapping the better arethe results mainly in terms of the match in the fea-ture entropy curves.4 ConclusionWe dedicated the preceding sections of this articleto analyze and synthesize the consonant invento-ries of the world?s languages in the framework of acomplex network.
Table 2 summarizes the resultsobtained from the four models so that the readercan easily compare them.
Some of our importantobservations are?
The distribution of occurrence and co-occurrenceof consonants across languages roughly follow apower law,?
The co-occurrence network of consonants has alarge clustering coefficient,?
Groups of consonants that largely co-occuracross languages are driven by feature economy(which can be expressed through feature entropy),?
Each of the above properties emerges due to dif-ferent reasons, which are successively unfurled byour models.So far, we have tried to explain the physical sig-nificance of our models in terms of the processof language change.
Language change is a col-lective phenomenon that functions at the level ofa population of speakers (Steels, 2000).
Never-theless, it is also possible to explain the signif-icance of the models at the level of an individ-ual, primarily in terms of the process of languageacquisition, which largely governs the course oflanguage change.
In the initial years of languagedevelopment every child passes through a stage607called babbling during which he/she learns to pro-duce non-meaningful sequences of consonants andvowels, some of which are not even used in thelanguage to which they are exposed (Jakobson,1968; Locke, 1983).
Clear preferences can beobserved for learning certain sounds such as plo-sives and nasals, whereas fricatives and liquids areavoided.
In fact, this hierarchy of preference dur-ing the babbling stage follows the cross-linguisticfrequency distribution of the consonants.
This in-nate frequency dependent preference towards cer-tain phonemes might be because of phonetic rea-sons (i.e., for articulatory/perceptual benefits).
Inall our models, this innate preference gets cap-tured through the process of preferential attach-ment.
However, at the same time, in the context oflearning a particular inventory the ease of learningthe individual consonants also plays an importantrole.
The lower the number of new feature distinc-tions to be learnt, the higher the ease of learningthe consonant.
Therefore, there are two orthogonalpreferences: (a) the occurrence frequency depen-dent preference (that is innate), and (b) the feature-dependent preference (that increases the ease oflearning), which are instrumental in the acquisi-tion of the inventories.
The feature-based kernel isessentially a linear combination of these two mu-tually orthogonal factors.ReferencesA.-L. Baraba?si and R. Albert.
