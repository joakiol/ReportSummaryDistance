INTRODUCTIONFrequent ly  a quest ioner  expects  more than  ad i rec t ,  l i te ra l  response  a l though he must assumethat  the  answerer  i s  not  in fo rmed about  what  par -t i cu la r  in fo rmat ion  he i s  seek ing .
The quest ionerimputes to a cooperat ive dia logue partner the com-municative competence to reply to a simple yes-noquest ion like (I) with an extended response (cf.
(12\], (11\]) l ike (la) rather than with a simpleYes.
( I )  Are you going to t rave l  this summer?
( la )  Yes, to Sicily.In the absence of special information about theprevious course of the dialog or the intentions ofthe questioner (the unmarked case) an answer l i ke( la)  seems more appropriate than (Ib) or ( I c ) .
(Ib) Yes, with an old school f r iend.

But i t  s t i l l  must b~ askedwhy in  d ia logs  o f  the  type  ' in fo rmat ion  ,upp ly 'the  unmarked response  takes  the  fo rm ( la )  ~nd not( lh )  or  ( l c ) .In th is  paper we w i l l  present the results of acomputational study of this problem for the domainResearch on HAM..ANS Is currently being supportedby the German Min ist ry  of Research and Technology(8MFT) under contract 081T15038' locomotion verbs' in dialogs based on a v isual lypresent world of discourse.
This quest ion is par-t icular ly important for the construct ion ofcooperat ive  d ia lo  9 sys tems,  s ince ,  in  many app l i -ca t ions ,  no exp l i c i t  knowledge about  the  d ia loggoa ls  o f  the  quest ioner  i s  ava i lab le  a t  theoutset .

Th is  suggests  that  the  unf i l l ed  opt iona lcase s lo ts  in  the  quest ion  are  cand idates  fo radd i t iona l  in fo rmat ion .
For a quest ion  l i ke  (2 ) ,in  wh ich  a l l  the  deep case s lo ts  o f  'b reak '  aref i l l ed ,  on ly  a d i rec t  response  l i ke  (2a) i s  to  beexpected  as a pos i t ive  answer ,  wh i le  in  (3 ) ,  whereonly the obl igatory deep case slots are fil led, anextended response  l i ke  (3a) can be expected .
(2) Did you break  the  window wi th  your  s l ingshotyesterday?
(2a)  Yes.
(3) Did you break  the  window?
(3a)  Yes, w i th  my s l ingshot .Since not every  opt ional  deep case o f  a g iven  verbunspeci f ied in the quest ion is suitable for anunmarked extended response  (e .g .
( la ) - ( l c ) )  we maydef ine  the  prob lem more prec ise ly  by ask ing  wh icho f  the  deep case s lo ts  unspec i f ied  in  the  quest ionare  to  be chosen as the  unmarked va lues .For our  domain Of invest igat ion  ' locomot ion  verbs 'le t  us cons ider  quest ions  (4) and (5 ) ,  wh ich  re ferto  a v i sua l ly  p resent  wor ld  o f  d i scourse .
In  eachcase perceptua l  p rocesses  are  assumed as a prere -qu is i te  fo r  the  answer .4) Which veh ic le  s topped?&a) The bus,  on Har tungst reet .4b) The bus,  because the  dr iver  s tepped on thebrake .5) Did the bus turn off?5a) Yes, from Hartungstreet onto Schlueterstteet.5b) Yes, together with the tax i  cab.The instant iat ion of the iocat lve slot in answer(4a) and the source and goal slots in (Sa) ispredictable in contrast to the causative s lot  in(4b) and the co agent s lot  in (5b).
As examples(4) and (5) demonstrate, the same optional deepcase s lot  is not always selected as the unmarkedoption.
The choice is dependent upon the verb con-tained in the question.
Moreover, {Sa) shows thatcombinations of deep cases are possible inunmarked extended responses,In the area under invest igat ion here, the follow-ing heurist ic carl be employed to determine the188FAMILIAR WITHSCENE BUTCANNOT SEE ITPDP-IONL DIALOG SYSTEMHAMANSIMAGE SEQUENCEANALYSIS SYSTEMNAOSMORIO\] ILSTREET INTERSECTIONFig.
1: Situat ional  context of the dialogselection of the deep case slots for an um~markedextended response: Select the deep case slotswhich contain the concepts necessary for the per-ceptual verification of the motion descrlbed bythe verb.In order to verify a stop-event it is necessary todetermine the end point of the motion (Cf.
(4a))but not the cause (cf.
(4b)).
For a turn-off eventa change of d i rect ion between source and goal mustbe establ ished (cf.
(Sa)).
It is not essent ia l  todetermine whether other objects make this changeof direct ion at the same time (cf.
(Sb)).Hence case role f i l l ing fo r  the construct ion of  anextended response can be regarded as a side effectof the visual, search necessary to answer the ques-tion.This also appears plausible when seen in the l ightof the beliefs that the quest ioner  imputes to theanswerer .
The quest ioner bel ieves that theanswerer wil l  fil l in the case sluts necessary foranswer ing  the quest ion and that it is thereforeunnecessary to expl ic i t ly  ment ion these in thequestion.
Addit ional ly the quest ioner bel ievesthat the answerer  believes that the quest ionerexpects an extended reply and fur this reason didnot expl ic it ly request the addit ional  information.A cooperat ive dialog system fulf i l ls this userexpectat ion by applying the heurist ic formulatedabove.A prerequis i te for the appl icat ion of this heuris-tic is that \[he system have knowledge about whichdeep case slots are relevant for the ver i f icat ionOF a movem~mt.
This prerequis i te is not met bymost natural language (NL) systems since they sim-ply represent events in the  domain or discourse infully instant~ated Form using case frames, e.g.
aspart of a semantic net or frame hierarchy.
In con-trast, the G,,rman language dialog system HAM-ANS(Hamburg application--oriented natural  languagesystem) \[6\], which we have developed, can applythis heuris(~c because in addit ion to the caseframe of each verb the system includes a represen-tation of the referent ial  semantics of predica-tions associated with that verb which makes itpossible to ~valuate the ViSual input data for  themovement in question.The goa l  of this art icle is to elucidate therepresentat ion construct ions for case frames andreferent ia l  semantics of verbs of motion used inHAM-ANS and to i l lustrate their use in generat ingunmarked extended responses.2.
A SHORT OVERVIEW OF HA~-ANSHAM-ANS is a large German natural  l anguage dialogsystem of both considerable depth and breadthwhich presently provides access to three di f ferentappl icat ion classes, namely an expert system(hotel reservat ion situation), a database system( f i shery  data)  and a scene ana lys i s  system(traffic scene) .The communicat ive situations the system handlesare character ized as follows:In the hotel reservat ion situation the systemtakes the role of  a hotel manager, who tries topersuade the user to book a room.
The caller isassumed to have the overal l  goal of determiningwhether the room offered meets his requirements.The system must attempt to recognize the user sspec i f i c  des i res  concern ing  the  room as they  arerevealed - usual ly indirect ly - in his utterancesand to make use of the various devices avai lablein natural  language that permit the room in ques-tion to be presented in a part icular ly  favorablel ight (e.g.
the generat ion of tendentious descrip-tions using hedged relat ive adjectives).In the database appl icat ion \[8\] HAM-ANS providesmarine scientists with NL access to a f isherydatabase, which contains data col lected dur inginternat ional  exped i t ions  in the South At lant icand the Indian Ocean.
The complex structured datasets, which consist of cruise data concerning thevesse ls '  voyages , k r i l l  b io logy  data ,  re levantnet  hau ls  and oceanograph ic  data ,  are s to red  in  are la t iona l  database  (76 re la t ions .

REPRESENTATION FORMALISMS FOR THE SEMANTICS OFLOCOMOTION VERBS3,1.
THE GEOMETRICAL SCENE DESCRIPTIONA basic requirement for  answering questions aboutmovements that have occurred in real  sequences ofscenes is an adequate representation of thesesequences.
Not only the shape, the centers ofgrav i ty ,  col,,r, etc.
of objects must berepresented, but also the t ra jec tor ies  of movingob\]ects.Thls geometrical scene description consists of acombinat ion  o f  automat ica l ly  generated  outputs  oFthe scene ana lys i s  p rocesses  ( inso far  as th i s  i sp resent ly  poss ib le )  and a number o f  manual augmen-ta t ions .The length in time of the scene under considera-t ion is ca.
14 sec., which corresponds.to ca.
360single TV images.
From these 360 lmages 72snapshots  are coded in a re la t iona l  fo rmal i sm,denot lng  which ob jec ts  were observed ,  the shape o fthese objects, the i r  current center of grav i ty  andsome other properties (e.g.
co lor ) .
The represen -rat ion of the f i r s t  snapshot contains informationabout a l l  objects that are v i s ib le  at that time.For the successive snapshots only changes withrespect to the predecessors are recorded, i.e.objects and their descr ipt ions are only entered ifthey  have changed locat ion  or appeared in  thescene.
A tra jectory of an object is determined byits di f ferent centers of grav i ty  relative to anunderly ing coordinate system.

THE REPRESENTATION LANGUAGES SURF AND DEEPThe log ic -o r iented  semant ic  representat ionlanguages  SURF and DEEP are the  cent ra l  represen-ta t ion  fo rmal i sms used in  HAM-ANS.
These languagesare des igned to  be dec la ra t ive  and eas i ly  extend-ab le .

THE CASE-FRAME LEXICONThe case f rames fo r  verbs  used in  the system ares tored  in  the case-frame lex icon  \ [5 \ ] .
Each ent ryin  the word lex icon  fo r  a verb  conta ins  a po in terto i t s  app l i cab le  case frame which  descr ibes  thesemant ics  o f  that  verb  in  terms o f  case re la t ions .A case frame i s  represented  as a combinat ion  o fdeep case descr ip t ions  spec i fy ing  fo r  each deepcase i t s  name, a marker ,  whether  the deep case i sob l igatory  (0) or  opt iona l  (F ) ,  and the semant icres t r i c t ions  which are  requ i red  f rom a syntact i csubst ructure  to  f i l l  the deep case (o f .

For verbs  with d i f fe rentre ferent ia l  semantics, e.g. '
to  accelerate' and' to  stop' ,  a single case frame, namely that speci-tying an obl igatory AGENT of type 'veh ic le '  and aoptional LOCATIVE of type ' thoroughfare' ,  isapplied during the analysis phase.Case frames are formulated in SURF so that thechecking of the semantic res t r i c t ions  can beaccomplished by the inference rules usuallyapplied during the evaluation of a complete utter--ance; The se lect ional  res t r i c t ion  that, e.g.
,  theNP a car' describe an object of the class ofvehicles, and therefore be a possible candidate tof i l l  ~ the agent role of the verb ' to  stop' ,  can be190ver i f ied  because of the t rans i t i v i ty  of the super-set re la t ion  in the conceptual semantic net.In the case- f rame lex icon  the case f rames are notrecorded  in  the form shown in  f ig .

THE FLAVOR SYSTEMThe F lavor  system \ [2 \ ]  \ [13\ ]  i s  an imp lementat ion  o fthe language features  that  suppor t  ob jec t -o r ientedprogramming.
Two k inds  o f  ob jec ts  ex is t  in  a F la -vor  system, namely one ca l led  f l avor  and the o theri ns tance  of a f lavor .
A f lavor represents a gen-eric object and an instance an i nd iv idua l  rea l i za -t ion of a ge,~eric ob ject .
It is possible to sendmessages to both k inds  of objects.
F lavors  areorganized in ,, d i rected graph called the f lavorgraph?
There is one des ignated  flavor, thevani l la  flays, r, which  corresponds to the th ingframe in FRL \[I0\].
Since the heritage of informa-tion for  each f lavor  is provided by the f lavorgraph, i t  zs necessary to specify for  each newlydefined f lavor  i t s  locat ion in the graph by namingi t s  d i rect  predecessors ( i t s  superf lavors).
Theinformation contained in a f lavor  is a combinationof a l l  the information inherited from i t s  super-f lavors  and the added information given by i t s  owndef in i t ion .
The added information can also over-ride, augment or modify the inherited information.This is one dimension of the information containedin a flavor: owned or inherited.
Another is thedec larat ive/procedura l  dist inction.
The declara-t ive  knowle~tge of a Flavor is stored in variablesof di f ferent kinds whereas procedural  knowledge isencoded in so called methods?One kind of variable the i ns tance  var iab le  - isused to give instances of the same generic objecttheir individual information.
The other kind - thec lass  var iab le  is owned by a flavor, can be'bequeathed '  to other f lavors ,  and accessed by anyob jec t  in  the f lavor  system.
However,  a f lavor  i son ly  a l lowed to  change a va lue  o f  a c lass  var i -ab le ,  if it owns this variable.Methods are funct ion def in i t ions that implementthe operat ions def ined for each flavor.
The combi-nation of methods from di f ferent  f lavors is cal ledmix ing  f lavors.In compar ison w i th  FRL the F lavor  system hasmain ly  th ree  d i s t ingu ish ing  features :The 'A k ind  o f '  s lo t  in  FRL serves  both fo res tab l i sh ing  an inher i tance  h ie rarchy  and fo rconnect ing  ins tances  to  superc lasses ,  i .e .

On the o ther  hand thef lavor  graph i s  bu i l t  by spec i fy ing  thesuper f lavors  fo r  each f lavor ,  ins tances  arec reated  by the  make- ins tance-method.Because the  d i s t inc t ion  between gener icf rames and ins tances  i s  not  made in  FRL therei s  a l so  no d i s t inc t ion  between ins tance  var i -ab les  and c lass  var iab les ?

\ [2 \ ] ) .Although the f lavor  system is a tool  for  thedevelopment of large software systems and not aknowledge representation language, i t  includes thebasic concepts for  the rapid design of spec i f icknowledge representat ion  formalisms.

B, which shows a t raced  ver -s ion  o f  the example.The processing of a user's NL input starts  with ara ther  elaborate lexical and morphologicalanalysis - a process which on the one hand reducessingle words to the i r  canonical forms with the i rmorphologi<al and syntact ic  features (e.g.
gender,person, number) and on the other hand recognizessyntagmatic groups of words and discontinuous verbconstituents, transforming them according topredefined rules.The generated structure - the preterminal string(not shown in fi@.
8) - forms the input to theparser.
The syntact lc  ana lys i s  cons is ts  of twod i f fe rent  strategies,  both of which use the sameATN-definit ions of syntact ic  categories, e.g.
fornoun phrases and prepos i t ional  phrases.

7: An instance of TURNthese strategies - always applied for sentenceswith  copu la  verbs  - uses a sur face  grammar to  copew i th  word order var ia t ions .
The o ther  i s  a case-d r iven  ana lys i s  s t ra tegy  which i s  used fo r  sen-tences  conta in ing  verbs  w i th  an assoc ia ted  casef rame.Since in the example the verb 'to go by' has acase frame the second strategy is applied.
Afteran access to the case-frame lexicon the case frameis constructed.
This case frame is used to guidethe parsing in the fo l lowing manner: The al@orithmf i r s t  attempts to recognize those syntact ic  con-s t i tuents  that are possible candidates for a deepcase marked ob l igatory ,  and then to  recogn izethose const i tuents  that  are poss ib le  cand idatesfo r  opt iona l  deep cases.
When the input  i s  com-p le te ly  consumed and a l l  ob l igatory  deep cases aref i l l ed  the process  ends .The test for determining if a syntactic consti-tuent is a possible candidate to f i l l  a spec i f icdeep case is divided into a syntactic and a seman-tic check.
The syntactic check requires, e.g.,that in order to fill the agent role a constituentmust contain the attr ibute 'nominative' (sentencein act ive voice) and that i t s  number  mustcorrespond to that of the verb.
The semantic checkrequires that the noun of the const i tuent fu l f i l lthe semantic res t r i c t ions  specif ied for thespec i f i c  deep case.
Th is  i s  accompl i shed  throughthe bu i ld ing  o f  a SURF express ion  fo r  the const i -tuent ,  the t rans format ion  o f  th i s  express ion  in toa DEEP express ion ,  and the eva luat ion  o f  the DEEPexpress ion  on the bas is  o f  the conceptua l  net .In our example on ly  the agent case is marked asob l igatory  and the noun phrase 'wh ich  t rucks '  fu l -f i l l s  both the syntact i c  and semant ic  requ i rementsto f i l l  th i s  s lo t .
S ince no o ther  syntact i c  con-st i tuents  are encountered ,  the complete SURFrepresentation is constructed.The structure is normalized into a DEEP structure.One of the maln tasks or th is  process is thedetermination of the scope of quant i f ie rs .
Thealgorithm used for  th is  purpose is modelled a f terthe one described by Hendrix \ [4 \ ] ;  i t  takes intoaccount the re la t ive  strength of natural  languagequant i f ie rs  (e.g.
'a ' ,  'both ' )  and question opera--tots (e.g.
'which' 'how many ).
The strength isdetermined  by a numeric va lue ,  which in some casesi s  mod i f ied  by the degree o f  genera l i ty  o f  thenoun.
E.g.

Generate and tes tprocedures can De viewed as being act ivated  bypat tern -d i rec ted  invocat ion  and d i f fe r  from eacho ther  in  that  the generate  procedures ass ignin terna l  ob jec t  ident i f ie rs  to var iab les  in  DEEPfo rmulas ,  wh i le  the tes t  procedures y ie ld  twova lues ,  the f i r s t  o f  which i s  e i ther  a fu l l yins tant ia ted  formula  equ iva lent  to the input  fo r -mula or  a mod i f ied  fo rmula ,  and the second o fwhich ind icates  the t ru th  va lue  o f  the input  fo r -mula in  the range \ [0 ,1 \ ] .
In the in terpretat ionphase these two processes in teract  in  such a waythat  a tes t  at tempt  ac t ivates  generate  procedureswhich in  turn  ca l l  tes t  procedures and so on.A c loser  look  at  our example shows that  a f te r  thef i r s t  tes t  at tempt  has d i scovered  a s t ruc ture  con-ta in ing  a var iab le  in th i s  case the termrepresent ing  the noun phrase 'which t rucks '  - apackage of  generate  procedures is  ac t ivated  toproduce the set o f  ob jec t  ident i f ie rs  denot ing  there ferent ia l  set of objects that are trucks - hereTRUCK1 and TRUCK2.
The res t  o f  the formula  isthen recurs ive ly  sent to a tes t  process w i th  thevar iab le  'w14' rep laced  by elements o f  the re fer -ence set fo r  t rucks  one a f te r  the o ther .The next  formula  to be tes ted  requ i res  the genera-t ion  of  a set of  ins tances  of  the type GO_BY.Since events are not represented  in  fu l l yins tant ia ted  form but ra ther  must be ext rac tedfrom the geometr i ca l  scene descr ip t ion ,  a spec ia lset o f  procedures - the methods spec i f ied  in  theverb f lavor  h ie rarchy  - i s  ac t ivated .
(See sect ion3 .4 .2  fo r  how th i s  process funct ions , )A ver i f i ca t ion  o f  an event GO BY i s  poss ib le  on lyfo r  TRUCK2.
The add i t iona l  ~nformat ion  ext rac teddur in  9 the process o f  v i sua l  search - the spec i f i clocat ion  o f  the event - i s  recorded in  the loca -t i ve  s lo t .Dur ing the fo rmat ion  o f  the resu l t  o f  the eva lua-t ion ,  the system, guided by genera l  heur i s t i cs ,dec ides whether  the add i t iona l  deta i l  w i l l  causetoo ~reat  a complex i ty  in the answer or  not \ [11 \ ] .In th i s  case the complex i ty  i s  su i tab le  and thelocat ion  w i l l  be mentioned in  the answer.The word 'wh ich '  i s  de f ined  as quant i f ie r  thatcauses a descr ip t ion  of  a set o f  ob jec ts  to  bere turned  ( ins tead  o f  a t ru th  va lue) .
Thus the seto f  re ference  ob jec ts  fo r  which the propos i t ion  inquest ion  could be ver i f ied ,  i .e .
TRUCK2, i s  sub-s t i tu ted  fo r  the noun phrase 'which t rucks ' .The resu l t ing  DEEP express ion  i s  t rans formed bythe inverse  normal i za t ion  process in to  a SURFexpress ion .
In o rder  to verba l i ze  extendedresponses in a manner both in fo rmat ive  and conc iseas poss ib le ,  the e l l ips i s  generat ion  processe l ides  those par ts  o f  the semantic representat iono f  complete responses that  are ident ica l  to thes tored  representat ion  of  the quest ion  \ [ ?

In this case the NP-generatordecides not to generate a def in i te  descriptionsince neither the system nor the user has a l readyre fer red  to TRUCK2 in the prev ious  dialog and theex is tence  of  TRUCK2 as a moving ob3ect i s  notimp l ied  by the ex is tent ia l  assumptions supp l ied  bythe a pr io r i  user model (c f .
