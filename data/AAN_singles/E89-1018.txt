Collocations in Multilingual GenerationUlrich tieid, Sybille RaabUniversit~t Stuttgart, Projekt PolyglossInstitut f/ir maschinelle SprachverarbeitungKeplerstrasse 17D-7000 Stuttgart 1, West GermanyAbstractWe present a proposal for the structuringof collocation knowledge 1 in the lexicon ofa multilingual generation system and showto what extent it can be used in the pro-cess of lexical selection.
This proposal ispart of Polygloss, a new research projecton multilingual generation, and it has beeninspired by work carried out in the S EM-SYN project (see e.g.
\[I~(~SNEtt 198812).The descriptive approach presented in thisproposal is based on a combination of re-sults from recent lexicographical researchand the application of Meaning-Text-Theory(MTT) (see e.g.
\[MEL'CUK et al 1981\],\[MEL'CUK et al 1984\]).
We first outline theoverall structure of the dictionary system thatis needed by a multilingual generator; section 2gives an overview of the results of lexicograph-ical work on collocations and compares themwith "lexical functions" as used in Meaning-Text-Theory.
Section 3 shows how we intendto integrate collocations in the generation dic-1We use the term "collocation" in the sense of\[HAUSMANN 1985\] referring to constraints on thecooccurrence of two lexeme words; the two elementsare not completely freely combined, but one of themsemantically determines the other one.
Examples arefor instance solve a problem, turn dark, expose someoneto a risk, etc.

We assume that the system's lex-ical knowledge is stored in the following typesof "specialized ictionaries":?
semantic: inventory of possible lexicaliza-tions of a concept in a given language;syntactic: one inventory of realizationclasses per language, providing informa-tion about number, type and realizationof the arguments of a given lexeme;?
morphological: one inventory of inflec-tional classes per language.Since none of these levels of decsriptionis completely independent, the dictionariesshould be linked to each other by means ofcross-references and reference to class mem-bership.
Templates and mechanisms allow-ing for explicit inheritance of shared proper-ties, e.g.
redundancy rules, will be used withinaFor more details on the dictionary structure see\[HEID/MOMMA 1989\].- 130  -each of the layers.
These mechanisms give ac-cess to the knowledge about the linguistic "be-haviour" of lexemes needed in the process oflexicalization 4.2 Approaches to the descrip-tion of collocations2.1  Cont r ibut ions  f rom lex icogra -phyThe tradition of British Contextualism 5 de-fines collocations on the basis of statistical as-sumptions about the probability of the cooc-curence of two lexemes.
Particularly frequentcombinations of lexical units are regarded ascollocations.A more detailed efinition can be found inthe work of Franz Josef Hausmann (1985:119):"One partner determines, another isdetermined.
In other words: colloca-tions have a basis and a cooccurringcol locate.
"6This determination manifests itself in sofar as a given basis does not allow all of thecollocates that would be possible according togeneral semantic oocurrence conditions, butonly a certain subset: so in French, retenir sonadmiration, retenir sa haine, sa joie are possi-ble, but *retenir son dgsespoir is not.The choice of collocates depends tronglyon the lexeme that has been chosen as the ba-sis; knowledge about possible collocations canbe only partly derived from knowledge aboutgeneral semantic properties of lexemes.
There-fore general cooccurrence rules or selectional4Possibly including classifications according to se-mantically motivated lexeme classes and a modellingof paradigmatic relations between lexemes, such as hy-ponymy or synonymy.5The term "collocation" was introduced into linguis-tic discussion by John R. Firth (1951:94).eTranslation by the authors.
We use the terms ba-sis and collocate in the sense of \[ttAUSMANN 1985\];HAUSMANN'S original terms are Basis and Kollokator.restrictions (e.g.
using semantic markers) arenot adequate for the choice of collocates in theprocess of lexicalization.These considerations lead to two propos-als for the structuring of the lexical knowledgeused in a generator:?
Heuristic for the lexicalization process:"First the basis is lexicalized,then the collocate, dependingon which lexeme has been cho-sen as the basis.
"Knowledge about the possibility of com-bining lexemes in collocations hould bestored in the lexicalization dictionary(where lexicalization candidates for con-cepts are provided), and specifically in theentries for the bases.The following table shows in terms ofcategories 7 what can be a possible collocatefor a particular basisS:basis possible collocatesnoun noun, Verb , adjectiveverb adverbadjective adverb7Unlike British Contextualism (cf.
the recent\[SINCLAIR 1987\]) we assume that bases and collocatesare of one of the following categories: noun, verb, ad-jective or adverb.s For substantive-verb-coliocations, the classificationas basis and collocate is opposed to the usual syntac-tic description according to head and modifier; thishas consequences for the lexicalization process: whileit is usually possible to frst lexicalize the heads ofphrases, then the modifiers (e.g.
substantiveh~d,bo~s <adjective,~od~1~e~,coUo~ot~, the choice of verbs dependson their nominal complements (which are modifiers,but which have to be considered as bases of colloca-tions).
This means that nouns have to be lexicalized be-fore verbs, e.g.
Pi~'ne schmieden, but not *gute Vors~'tzeschmieden).- 131 -2.2 Lex ica l  funct ions  o f  theMean ing-Text -Theory  as a too lfo r  the  descr ip t ion  o f  co l loca -t ionsIn MTT ,  developed by Mel'~uk and co-workers, there exist about 60 "lexical func-tions" which describe regular dependencies be-tween lexical units of a language.
In MTT ,lexical functions are understood as cross-linguistically constant operators (f), whoseapplication to a lexeme ("keyword", L)yields other lexemes (v).
Mel'~uk (1984:6),(1988:31f) uses the following notation:f (L)  = vThe result of the application of a lexi-cal function to a given lexeme can be another"one-word" lexeme, or a collocation, an idiomor even an interjection.The parallelism between the collocationdefinition used in this paper and the notionof lexical function is that both start from theprinciple that collocates depend upon the re-spective bases (in MTT, v is a function of L).Therefore lexical functions eem to be a usefuldevice for the description of collocations in ageneration lexicon.In the following, we only consider lexi-ca/ functions which, when applied to a lex-eme word, yield collocationsS; Table 1 givessome examples of such lexical functions, to-gether with a definitional gloss, taken from\[STEELE/MEYER 198811?
:sit should be investigated to what extent the cat-egory of v is predictable for every f, according tothe category of L. For instance, J~s of group 1 and 2specified in the table below, applied to nouns, yieldsubstantive+verb-collocations, those of groups 3 and4 yield substantive+adjective-collocations, and thoseof groups 5 and 6 return substantive+substantive-collocations.l?Lexical functions of group 2, normally occur to-gether with those from 1; ABLB only occurs in combi-nation with other lexical functions.3 Generating CollocationsWe propose that every lexeme ntry in the lex-icalization dictionary contains lots for lexicalfunctions, whose fillers are possible collocates;within a slot/filler-notation as the one usedin Polygloss, a (partial) lexical entry, e.g.
forproblem, could be represented in the followingway:(p rob lem( .
.
.
)(caus func (create, pose))( rea l  ( so lve  .
.
.
.  )

)It might be possible to predict the typesof lexical functions applicable to a given lex-eme from its membership in a semantic lass.Syntactic properties of bases and collocates areaccessible through reference to the realizationlexicon.\ [MEL'CUK/POLGUERE 1987\]:271fthemselves tress the advantage of describ-ing collocations with lexical functions withinlanguage generation and machine translation:they give the example of OPER (*QUESTION*),realized as?

\[RAAB 1988\].3.2 The  generat ion  o f  paraphrasesOne of the aims in the development of the"how-to-say"-component of a generation sys-tem is to ensure that variants (i.e.
true para-phrases) can be generated for one and the samesemantic structure.This involves two types of knowledge:more 'static' knowledge about interchangeabil-ity of realization variants (synonymous items,information about paraphrase relations be-tween certain constructions or between col-locations) and more 'procedural' knowledgeabout heuristics guiding the choice betweencandidates.
The 'static' knowledge should berepresented eclaratively.
It can be dividedinto information about syntactic variants (e.g.participle form vs. relative clause) and in-formation about lexicalization variants.
In133 -\[MEL'(~UK 1988\]:38-41 rules are stated, whichexpress paraphrase relations between certaintypes of collocations.
Ideally these rules canbe set up for pairs of lexical functions, withoutconsideration of concrete lexemes.
Examplesare:Jean s'est mis en colors contre Paul(--INCEP OPER1)John got angry with PaulPaul s'est attirg la colors de Jean.
(--INCEP OPER2)Panl angered John.Jean s'est pris d'enthousiasme pour cetteddcouverte.
(=oPER)John got enthusiastic about this discovery.
(A cause de cette ddcouverte)l'enthousiasme s'est empard de Jean.
(=FuNc)John was enthused by this discovery.Within a generation system, such descrip-tions can be used to state paraphrase rela-tions between collocational lexicalization can-didates.
The choice between candidates de-pends on parameters, amongst which the fol-lowing ones seem to be essential:?
syntactic "behaviour" of the lexemesbuilding up a collocation 13- in relation to roles in the frame struc-ture to be realized;- in relation to the thematic structureof the intended utterance;18We plan to investigate to what extent it is possibleto describe the syntactic form of certain collocationswith general rules.
This is possible e.g.
for OVER,FUNC, LABOR, i.e.
for lexical functions yielding col-locations of the type of "Funktionsverbgeffige":OPBR(L) , verb (SUBJ OBJ .
.
.
)(OBJ PRBD) = LPUNO(L) , verb < SUBJ .
.
.
)(SUBJ PRED) -~LABOR(L) ~ verb (SUBJ OBJ Y )(V PRBD) = L?
markedness of lexemes (e.g.
registers,style);?
general heuristics for text generation (e.g.
"avoid repetition", "avoid deep embed-ding" etc.
)In the following, we give an example forthe lexicalization possibilities that can be de-scribed with the proposed evice:given the following (rudimentary) semanticrepresentation 14:mental process : *BE- HAPPY*:BEARER *P IERRE*:CAUSE *NEWS*,there should be available the following in-formation about collocations with joie as abasislS:CAUS FU NC(joie)CAUS OVER(joie)INCEP FUNC(joie)INCEP OPER(joie)= causer la joiede qn,causer dela joie chez qn= rgjouir qn,mettre qn en joieremplir qn de joie= la joies'empare de qnla joie saisit qn,la joie nab dansle coeur de qn= qn se met enjoieThe choice between INCEP and CAUSE de-pends on whether (and how) the causality is tobe expressed.
The choice between INCEP OPERand INCEP FUNC depends on whether the re-laization of *PIERRE* or Of*NEWS* should be-come the subject.14 menta/ process is meant to be a concept type;:BBARBR and :OAUSB are semantic relations; *BB-HAPPY*~ *PIBRRB* and *NBWS* are concepts.ZSIn simplified notation.
The first two examples areroughly equivalent to English make someone happy, fillsomeone with joy, the latter ones to to please someone.- 134  -Here constraints caused by the syntax ofthe utterance to be generated play an impor-tant role: in a relative clause e.g.
the an-tecedent has already been introduced.
Thisfact limits the choice:?

.
.

et alrs Mar ie  envoya cette nouvelle fiPierre, qu i .
.
.- se rdjouit (= CAUS FUNC)-- se mit en jo ie (= CAUS FUNC)This example shows that the heuristic"lexicalize bases first, then collocates" inter-acts with constraints stemming e.g.
from syn-tax; these constraints can also be produced bya text structuring component (decisions abouttopic, thematic order etc.).
The modular de-sign of the lexicon supports generation of vari-ants by giving access to all information eededat the appropriate choicepoints.4 Conclusion and directionsfor future workWe propose a method for the description ofknowledge about collocations in the dictionaryof a multilingual generation system.
Advan-tages for text generation result from the ap-plication of MTT's lexical functions and theformulation of the heuristic discussed above.In the generation literature, the gener-ation of collocations is regarded as a prob-lem (cf.
\[MATTHIESSEN 1988\]).
The onlysystem we know of, in which attempts havebeen made to bring it to a solution, is DIO-GENES, a knowledge based generation sys-tem under development at Carnegie Mel-lon University 16.
Our approach differs fromNIRENBURG'S in that it introduces the dis-tinction between basis and collocate.
Thisleads to differences in the lexicalization strat-egy: within DIOGENES, heads are lexicalizedbefore modifiers, irrespective of word classes,cf.
\[NIRENBURG/NIRENBUI~G 1988\].
; wehave come up with data that seems to favourthe distinction between basis and collocate.Further contrastive descriptive work willbe the basis for a prototypical implementa-tion within Polygloss.
With respect o lexicalfunctions, some questions related to defaults(e.g.
syntactic realization defaults, inheritanceof collocational properties within lexem classesetc.)
should be investigated in more detail.4.1 AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Sergei Nirenburg andour collegues at the IMS for the fruitful discus-sions in this paper.
