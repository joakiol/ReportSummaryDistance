Putting a Value on Comparable DataKevin KnightUSC Information Sciences Institute4676 Admiralty WayMarina del Rey, CA, 90292 USAknight@isi.eduInvited TalkAbstractMachine translation began in 1947 with aninfluential memo by Warren Weaver.
In thatmemo, Weaver noted that human code-breakerscould transform ciphers into natural language(e.g., into Turkish)?
without access to parallelciphertext/plaintext data, and?
without knowing the plaintextlanguage?s syntax and semantics.Simple word- and letter-statistics seemed to beenough for the task.
Weaver then predicted thatsuch statistical methods could also solve atougher problem, namely language translation.This raises the question: can sufficienttranslation knowledge be derived fromcomparable (non-parallel) data?In this talk, I will discuss initial work intreating foreign language as a code for English,where we assume the code to involve both wordsubstitutions and word transpositions.
In doingso, I will quantitatively estimate the value ofnon-parallel data, versus parallel data, in termsof end-to-end accuracy of trained translationsystems.
Because we still know very little aboutsolving word-based codes, I will also describesuccessful techniques and lessons from therealm of letter-based ciphers, where the non-parallel resources are (1) enciphered text, and (2)unrelated plaintext.
As an example, I willdescribe how we decoded the Copiale cipherwith limited ?computer-like?
knowledge of theplaintext language.The talk will wrap up with challenges inexploiting comparable data at all levels: letters,words, phrases, syntax, and semantics.1Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, page 1,49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Portland, Oregon, 24 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational Linguistics
