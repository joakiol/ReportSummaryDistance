ON-AHSWCRING SYSTEMAn integral part of any natural language understanding sys tern,but one which has received very l i t t l e  a t t e n t i o n  i n  application, i sthe lexicon.
It i s  needed during the parsing of the input text formaking inferences, and for generating language output or performingsome action.
This paper d i s c u s s e s  Lhe principal questions concern-ing the lexicon as i t  relates i n  particular t o  a question-answeringsystem and proposes a specific type of lexicon to f u l f i l l  the needso f  th is  system.Rather than make a d is t inct ion  between dictionary and encyclo-pedia, w e  have a single global data base which we c a l l  the lexicon.Homographs are differentiated and phrases with fixed meanings aretreated as separate entries.
A l l  the information in this lexiconis encoded i n  the form OZ relations and words or word senses.
Theseform a large network w i t h  the words as nodes and the relations asedges.
In addition the relations define semsntic f i e l d s  and theseare used to  treat problems of ambiguity.
Relations are use6 to en-code both syntactic and s m n t i c  information.
Axiom schemes areassociated with each relation and these are used f o r  inferencing.The lexical  re lat ions  then are at  the heart (or brain) of  the systemfor representation, re tr i eva l ,  and inferencfng.For each relation we describe its semantics and the axioms appro-priate to  i t .
In the positing of l e x i c a l  re lat ions  our a p p r e h  hasbeen in?
luenced by the work of 4presfan, Me1 cuk, and Zolkovs~y .
Thelexical relations we have p o s i t e d  are the t r ad i t iona l  svnonvmy andantonymy, taxonomy, part whole, gradfig and approximately f o r t y  o thers .The whole set, deliberately l e f t  open ended, is subdiudded i n t o  n i n ~subsets which include attribute relatibns, coLl~cational relationsand paradigma ti* onEs.Each relation has its own lexical entry givhng its propertiesand t e l l i n g  how to interpret lexical relationships i n  a f i r s t  orderpredicate calculus form.
lor example, the tnformatfon for the lext-cal entry dog gncludes t h e  statement dog T animal, that is, t ha t  adog is a kind of mim~z.
The lexical enfry f o r  T, the taxonomic re-lation, i n  its turn includes infprmatic , which allows the statementto be interpreted asHoZda(Ncom(dog,X)) - RoZds(lYcorn(anima1,X)).The inventory of relations i s  expandable simply by adding lexicalentries for new relations.
In a d d i t i o n  having both the lexical en-tries and the relations in the entrdes expressed in the same nota-t ional  form as t h a t  of input sentences, namely in a Eirst orderpredicate calculus notation, allows for a consistent,  coherent, andeasily modifiable system for  analysis ,  inference, and s y n t h e b i ~ ,T A B U  OF CQNTENTS.

INTRODUCTIONThe lexicon presented he re  is being developed a s  a n  i n t e g r a l  p a r tof a computer question-answering system which answers multiple-choiceques t ians  about simple c h i l d r e n ' s  s t o r i e s ,  It thus  must make informa-t i o n  r e a d i l y  ava i l ab l e  f o r  t h e  parsing process,  f o r  bu i ld ing  an i n t e r n a lnodel O F  t h e  s t o r y  being read,  and f o r  making inferences .
Knovledgenbout words and knowledge about the  world must both b e  s to red  i n  a com-pact bu t   mediately a c c e s s i b l e  form.Many decis ions  must be made, the re fore ,  about t h e  design of t helexicon.
The f i r s t  problem is t o  decide  on an o rgan iz ing  s t r u c t u r e ,Should Lexical and "encycloped~c" information be s to red  separately o rtogether?
Which ltems w i l l  have s e p a r a t e  l e x i k 3 l  entries?
Which w i l lbe included i n  o the r  e n t r i e s ?
What about homonymy and polysemy?
Whatconnecting l i n k s  between words and word senses  w i l l  be  recorded and how?The next problem i s  t o  determine a  c h a r a c t e r i z a t i o n  of word mean-ings.
This l e ads  t o  some deep t h e o r e t r c a l  questrohs What kind ofl e x i c a l  semantic r ep re sen ta t i ons  are appropriate?
What i s  t h e  structureo t  these  represefi tat ions?
What are t h e  semantic primes, t he  elements oft h a t  s t r u c t u r e ?
The des ign  of the l e x i c a l  en t ry  i s  thus  sub jec t  t o  theo-r e t i c a l  b i a s e s  a s  w e l l  as the p r a c t i c a s  c o n s t r a j n t s  of space, r e t r f e v a le f f k i e n c y ,  and e f f e c t i v e  support  of rnference-making.The dec i s ion  t o  u se  l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  as fundamental elements ofthe strucl ture of t h e  l ex icon  has  s t rong ly  influenced our  design.
Re la t ionsa r e  w e d  t o  encode both semantic and syntactic information,  Axiom schemese s s e n t i a l  t o  inferencing are assoc ia ted  wi th  each r e l a t i o n .

They aS.Low us togeneralize familiar gnference patterns into axiom schemes.
They can en-capsulate the defining formulae of the commercial dictidnary.
They havean iritwitive appeal which w e  believe reflects a certain measure of psy-chological  rea l i ty .
On a pract ical  l eve l  they allbw~tls to  express bothsyntactic and semantic informa-tion i n  a form that i s  compact and eaay toretrieve.
They can be used i n  many ways.
For example, the followingparagraph from a test administered to  f i r s t  and second graders-by ,l oca l  school system says:(Pl) Ted has a puppy.
H i s  name is Happy.Ted and Happy l i k e  to play.
(Ql) The p e t  is  a: dog boy toyIn order to  answer t h i s  question w e  need to know what p& means.
In ourLexicon the lexical entry for pet contains a simple definition.
a pet i san animal that is owned by a human.
In order to answer th i s  question w ealso need to know that a puppy is a young dog.
'This information in pre-dicate calculus  form would be  p a r t  of  the lexical entry for  puxpy.
W ewould, of course, need axioms o f  the same form as w ' e l l  f o r  the entrqiesfor kitten, jamb, etc.
Instead of such a representation w e  express th i s;information by uslnp, a l exical re lat ion,  CIIILD.
The Lexical entry forpuppy contdins CHILD Jog.
S imi lar ly ,  the lexjcal entry for kitten con-tains CHILD cut; w h i l e  the lexical entry for CHILD contains the axio~tlscheme from which t h e  relevant axioms are formed when needed.We treat verb& in a s i m i l a r  way.
Corresponding to each case re-Lation there is a lexical relation which points to typfcal.
f i l l e r s  oft h a t  ca le s lo t .
Thc lexical entry for  bake2 includes TLOC ki tchen.
Italso i h c l u d e s ~  T make where T 1s the  well-known taxonomy r e l a t i o n ,  so t h a ti f  t he  s t o r y  says t h a t  "Mother baked a cake " w e  can1 i n t e r  t h a t  she inadeone add CAUSE bakel s o  t h a t  w e  car deduce that the  cake has baked   hes e l e c t  Lon r g s t r i c t i o n s  t h a t  help us  t e l l  ins tances  sf bakel and bdke2apn'rt can a l s o  be expressed compactly using t h e  T r e l a t i o n .
We a l s oneed t o  make d e d u c t i ~ n s  from main verbs i n  predica te  complemhnt con-s t ruc t ions ,  deduetions such ag t he  speaker 's  view of t h e  t r u t h  of theproposition stated i n  the complement as derived from t h e  f a c t i v i t y  ofthe  verb.
I n  order t o  answer several  questions from t h e  test  c i t e dabove the r e a d e r  must infer t h a t  everything t h a t  Mother says is  t rue .~ e x i c a l  e n t r i e s  f o r  main verbs t h a t  take  predica te  complements contaknpointers  t o  the  implicat ion c lgss .
These r e l a t i o h s  can then be expandedt o  give t h e  proper axioms.The lexicon includes separa te  e n t r i e s  f o r  each derived form u n l e s sthe root can be i d e n t i f i e d  by a simple suffix-chopp-tng rout ine .

There are, as wel l ,l e x i c a l  e n t r i e s  f o r  some mul t ip le  word expressions such as bir thday par ~IJ,baZZ g m ,  piggy bank, and thank you.As t o  t h e  form of presentat ion here ,  the next s e c t i o n  presents  someof the  p r a c t i c a l  problems and t h e o r e t i c a l  convictions which determined ourmost cr i t ica l  design decis ions.
Then, a f t e r  a br ie f  desc r ip t ion  of somee a r l i e r  developments i n  the  theory of l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s ,  we explain t h esystem of r e l a t i o n s  which s t r u c t u r e  our lexicon,  discussing each group ofr e l a t i o n s  i n  t u r n  F ina l ly  we descr ibe  the  a c t u a l  form of o u r  l e x i c a l  e n t r i e s .82.

Bierwisch and Kiefer (1970) assume that both kinds of informa-t ion are contained i n  the same lexical entry The distinction betweenlexical and encyclopedic knowledge corregponds then to the  dffferencebetween the care and the periphery of a lexical entry, whereThe core o f , a  l e x i c a l  reading copprises a l l  and onlythose semantic spec i f ica t ions  t h a t  determine, roughlyspeaking, its place within  thb  system of d ic t ionarye n t r i e s ,  i. e. del jmit  i t  from other  (non-synonymous')e n t r i e s .

A s  newe n t r i e s  a r e  added t o  t h e  system, information s u f f i c i e n t  t o  Ois t inguish oneenrry from another may have go be s h i f t e d  from the  periphery t o  t h e  core--and thus from t h e  encyclopedia t o  the  lexicop.
For ins tance,  s b ~ p o s e  anew entry,  "2eopard--a l a r g e ,  wild cat"  is  t o  be added.
The e n t i r e  lexiconmust be ~ear 'ched f o r  e n t r i e s  which mention large w i l d  cass.
I f  one i sfound, s a y  "lion--a l a r g e  wlld cat" ,  then enough information must be addedt o  both d e f i n i t i o n s  t o  d i f f e r e n t i a t e  leopard and z w f l  from each other.Soviet Lexicography and the Lmical Universe.Apresyan, iolkovsky, and  el ' Zuk run i n t o  the  same d i f f i c u l t y  of dis-t inguishing d ic t ionary  and encyclopedic $nformation i n  at tempting t o  def inet h e  l e x i c a l  universe of a word C0'The main themes d e a l t  wi th  under the  heading ' l e x i c a luniverse'  a re :  1) t h e  t y p e s  of Co;  2)  t h e  main p a r t s  o rphases of Co; 3) t y p i c a l  s i t u a t i o n s  occurring %efore  o ra f t e r  Co etc.
Thus, t h e  sec t ion  l e x i c a l  universe f o r  t h eward skis consis-ts of a l i a t  of the  types of s k i s  (racing,mountain, jumping, hunting), t h e i r  main p a r t s  ( s k i s  prdperand bindings), the  main objec ts  and ac t ions  necessary 2o.rthe  c o r r e c t  use  (explo i ta t ibn)  of s k i s  ( s t i c k s ,  grease, $0WLZE), the  main types of a c t i J i t i e s  connected wi th  skis (as k i - t r i p ,  a ski-race .

I  and so on.
Even these  scan*ytexamples make it  c l e a r  t h a t  t h e  information about the l ex i -c a l  universe is, a t  l e a s t  p a r t i a l l y ,  of an eneyclopaedicnature.
W e  say "partZallyl '  because genuine encyclopaedicinformation about skis ( t h e i r  h i s to ry ,  t he  waythey are manufactured, etc.)
is not suppliedhgre: t h e  sec t ions  contain only such words andphrases as are necessary f o r  ta lk ing  on the  t o p i c ,and nothing else .
(1970:19,)The problem here is that "what is needed f o r  ta lk ing  about the  toqic"hepends very much on who i s  going to  do the  talking.
The de f in i t i onof slEi i n  Webster 's Nm tntemationaZ (2nd Edition) begins :One of a pa i r  of narrow s t r i p s  of wood,metal, o r  p l a s t i c ,  usually i n  conibinatian,bound one on each foot  and used fox gl idingover a snow-covered surface.Apresyan, iolkovsky, and Me1 cuk do not provide fo r  three of the items,mentioned here: what sk is  a r e  made of (wood, p l a s t i c ,  or metal) ,  whatshape they come i n  (long and narrow) and where they belong s p a t i a l l y(on the  f e e t ) .
Yet these items could be e s sen t i a l  i n  understanding in-ferences i n  a story.It was snowing, Jim took out  h i s  skis.H e  waxed the wooden s t r ips .
.
.
.You could need t h i s  information i n  answering questions.Jim s k i d  down the  mountain....What was he wearing on h i s  f e e t :s l i ppe r s  s k i s  skates?Although i n  English o r  Russian i t  i s  poss ib le  t o  refer t o  s k i s  withoutknowing t h a t  they are  long and narrow, i t  is not possible  i n  Navajo wherephysical shapes determine verb forme.
While the  entry i n  Webster's goeson a t  length beyond the  sentence given above, it does not include a l lVthe i t e m s  which Apresyan, Zolkovsky, dhd Mel'guk mention.
This, however,is not  surprising; the boundaries o f  t he  l e x i c a l  universe are not w e l ldef  lned .Difficulties in updating a system with separate dictionary and encyclopedia,This lack of definition cahses tremepdous problem in a dynamic system.A "real" d ic t ionary  ar encyclopedia, the  one i n  a person's b r a in ,  iscons tan t ly  changing.
I n f o m a t i o n  is  added, correc ted ,  apd perhaps l o s t .A truly i n t e r e s t i n g  memorymodel must be dynamic.
T h e  problems of updatingt h i s  information are no t  easy t o  so lve ,  t h e  problem of d i s t i ngu i sh ing  be-tween d ic t ionary  and encyclopedic i n f ~ m i a t i o n  i n  t h e  updating processseems insuperable,Recognizing d e f i n i t i o n s  phrased i n  o rd inmy  English is already,  d i f f icult (Bferwisch and Rie fe r  1970, Lawler 1972).
Determhing the  r e l i a b i l i t yof such fnfornat ion is a l s o  a problem and t h e  dichotomy of d i c t i ona ry  andeacyclop&dia inc reases  t h i s  d i f f i c u l t y .
Unfortunately i n f ~ r m a t i o n  doespot cpme nea t ly  packaged and marked "for  the  dict30nary1' o r  " f o r  the en-cyc loped~a" .
And add i t i on  of ififormation t o  one p a r t  of the e n t r y  mayn e c e s s i t a t e  updating 'other  p a r t s  of th-e ent ry .
For example, i f  w e  l e a r nt h a t  record is a verb as well as a noun we need t o  add morphological in-formation, l e sc r ibe  the r e l a t i sons  between record and write, and we should #probably describe recording materials.
Mention must be made t h a t  recordis  a f a c t i t v ,  i .
e ,  i f  someone records  tha t  something happened, one canassume t h a t  from t h e  s tandpoint  of  t h e  speaker t h e  something r e a l l y  d idhappen.

He draws taxonomic t rees ,  one fo r  t h e  nounsand one fo r  t he  verbs, from the  vocabulary of a first grade reader.Then he makes statements l i k e  t h i s1.
Any noun below node 1 is a s u i t a b l e  subject fo rany verb below node 1'.2.
Only nouns below nodes 3 o r  4 may be subjects fo rverbe below node 3'.

We nowhave a mechanism for testing the ' coherence' or'meaningfulness' of new samples of text.
(1968, p.  51)Werner (1972) has suggested a method for handling the se lect lonal  prob-l e m  which uses noun taxonomies i n  very much the same way that Raphael does.H i s  proposal includes an elegant way of storing s e l e ~ t i o n a l  informationwithin h i s  memory model.
In his network model, noun phrase arguments areconnected t o  the verb by prepositions.
The node representing the lexicalentry f o r  the verb has arcs connecting i t  to compound nodes, one for eachprepwi t ion  which can be  used with the verb.
The object  of each prepo-s i t i o n  i s  a node i n  the noun taxonomy.
This noun or any noun below fti n  the taxonomy may serve as an argument for the verb.
Hem is an over-simplified example of  a network for saZ2.Figure 1: Werner's Ansyer t o  the Selection ProblemThis network says that oeZZ takes a human subject, a thing asobject ,  the preposit-n to followed by a human, the preposition Jbrfollowed by money.
The square brackets around [human] indicate that thisis  just a pointer to  the top noun i n  the taxonomy for human beings.Any node i n  th i s  taxonomy below the node marked human, whether i t  i sS m  OK a Navajo or Mother, can be used as a subject for saZZ.
He doesnot use the verb taxonomy as Raphael does.

Whether we should use atorage spacefor items whieh we can parse/produce without ambiguity is another question.Currently we provide separate e n t r i e s  for  any phrase that we cannotparse and i n t e r p r e t  co r r ec t ly  from the  e n t r i e s  f o r  individual words.

s O M ~  THEORIES OF LEItgcat RELATIONSWhile developing our lexical relations we examined a variety ofrelational theories in anthropology and lingui st ice and even col lectedfolk defilpitions of our own (Evens 1975) .
We have been parrlcularlyinfluenced by the anthropological fieldwork of Casagrande and Hale (1967)by the memory models of Raphael (1968) and Werner (19741, and most of allby the ECD of Apresyan, Me1 cuk, and Zolkovsky (1970).
But we looked ateach of these relational theories from t h e  peaaliar point crf view o f  cornput er ques tion-answering and the pal-titular lexical environment of ch i l -dren's stories, adding and discarding relations to  fit the problem.Cdsagmnde mrd Bale - L&caZ RejSations in FoZk Definitions.Casagrande and Hale (1967) collected 800 Papago folk-defini*tionsand sorted them into groups on the basis bf  semantic and grammaticalsimilarities.
They produced the following list of thirteen lexical re-lations.

Werner has made substantial  s t eps  i n  this second di-rection (Werner and Topper 1976).Werner's basic semantic re la t ions  are the taxonomic r e l a t i o n  (T) ,the modification or attribution re la t ion  (M) and the temporal sequencingre la t ion ,  queuing (Q) .
These he calls "the basic  cement of the organi-zation of.
c u l t u r a l  knowledge and memory. "

)own [x; y] (y owns an x.
)partg [ x ; y ]  (Some x is part of every y .
)part [x;y] (An x is part of y.
)r i g h t  [r;y] ( x  is t o  the right of y.

( i b i d ,  p.  92)Each relation R has an inverse z.
If aRb then the pair (R,b) i s  storedCon the property list of a and ( ~ , a )  i s  stored on the property l ist  ofb.
For each relat ion there are axioms.
Further axioms describe howfllfferent relations interact.
For instance, the set Inclusi~n relationhas the following properties:/r J [c] i .

,  set inclusion is  transit ivea ~ x A  x c y ~ a c yThe interaction between set inclusion and partg is expressed by theaxiomIn other words, if an x i s  part of a y and a z is a y then an x is pattof o z.
For example, if you know that mammals have hair and that whalesare mammals, then you know that whales have hair.Some of Raphael's relations represent particnlar information, somerepresent generic information.
It is the generic relations which cor-respond to the kind of lexical relations we are working with: set in-clusion, equiv, partg, and owng.33dprssgan, Zolkouskg, u d  Me$ '&k.The Explana tory-Combinator9 pic t ionary of Apr~syan , &el ' Zuk, andQZolko~sky (1970) contains a wide variety of l ex i ca l  re la t ions .

Their paper contains about f i f t y  re la t ions  and they outlineways of combining the  given re la t ions  t o  ge t  still more.
Many of theserelations appear i n  an e a r l i e r  paper by Zolkovsky and Mel16uk, which em-phasizes the  importance of specifying the  grammatical transformationsassocigted with each l ex i ca l  pairing.
Suppose a s to ry  says:The prince's g i f t  o f  a magic a p p l e  t o  Zamiyadismayed h i s  mother.Zn order t o  represent t h i s  correc t ly  or  answer a question l i k e  "Whatdid the  prince give Zamiya?"

THE SET OF LEXICAL RELATION&The fesearch reviewed above and our own experience with children' ss t o r i e s  has l e d  us  t o  pos i t  nine major categor ies  of re la t ioa6 .

What criteria can be used t o  decide whether two words41a r e  spnonymourUl Apresyan, ~o lkovsky  and   el ' Euk (1970 : 5) have a t  temptedt o  state a prec ise  c r i t e r ion :  the  two words should be s a n & c a l l ~  sub-s t i t u t a b l e  f 6 r  each other ,  t h e  meaning of one shouU be express ib le  throughthe  o ther  i n  any context.
But t h i s  c r i t e r i o n  subst idutes  one problem f o ranother.
How can one t e l l  whether such a s u b s t i t u t i o n  is successful ,whether the  r e s u l t i n g  sentences have t h e  same meaning?
It can be  arguedt h a t  d i f f e r e n t  sentence forms exist: .precisely i n  order t o  allow t h e  ex-pression of di f ferences  i n  meaning.
However impossible i t  may be t o  de-fine synonymy precisely ,  t h i s  concept i s  used d a i l y  i n  ordinary discourse*Dictionary writers use i t  constantly.
To sfmplify mat ters  it is  assumedher4 t h a t  the synonymy r e l a t i o n  holds between two words whenever any oft h e  d ic t ipna r i e s  i n  thz bibliography def ines  one as t h e  o ther .
This shouldI 1  be read as "rough synonymy" or approximate synonymy.

-Anton$my.Antonymy has long been recognized as a l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n .
WebsterrsNW CoZZsgiate Dictionmy, f o r  esample, r egu la r ly  lists antonyms.
I tsde f in i t ion  of cotd includes "Ant.
Hot" (1951:161) (The definition ofhot, although it mentions c ~ Z d ,  does not  include "Ant.
cold" ) The samed ic t i aaa ry  defines antonym a s  "A word so upposed i n  meaning t o  anotherword t h a t  i t  negates o r  n u l l i f i e s  every s i n g l e  one of i t s  implicat ions.
11It is  t r u e  that antonymy ind ica te s  some important f a c t s  about impl icat ions ,and these  need t o  be captured, bu t  i t  is  not true t h a t  amttoyrny involvesn q a r i n g  every proposition i n  sight.
The problem is t h a t  t h e r e  are manykinds of oppositeness of meaning.W e  have found four separa te  l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  whidt correspond t osepara te  subcategories of antonymy: complementarity, antonymy proper,converseness, and r e c i p r o t a l  kinship.1) CompZempntar<ty, i so la t ed  by Lyons (1968), is  t h e  kind ofoppositeness t h a t  holds between single and married o r  male and fmaze.The den ia l  of one implies the  a s s e r t i o n  of t h e  other:  m e  a s s e r t i o n  ofone implies the denia l  of t h e  other.I f  John is married, then John is  not  s i n g l e .I f  John i s  no t  married, then John is s i n g l eI f  John i m s i g g l e ,  then John i s  not married.I f  John is n o t  s ing le ,  then John is  married,j?

Antonymy.
Lyons r e s t r i c t s  the  tern antonyqj t o  the  ss tua t ionwhere the asser t ion  of one implies the denial  of the  other,  but the denialof one does not imply the  asser t ion  of the other.
~ e d  and green are anto-nyms in this sense.
I f  X i s  red, it is  not green.
OR the other  hand, i fX i s  not red it does not have t o  be green.
It could be blue o r  yellow in-stead.
I I o t  or  cold behave i n  the same way.
If X i s  hot  then it  i s  not cold,but i f  X is not hot we do not  know for sure t h a t  i t  i s  cold; it may j u s tbe lukewarm.
We set up a l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  ANTI t o  express t h i s  kind ofantonymy .
Again it appl ies  par ticularlj t o  ad j ec t i v e s  and adverbs belong-ing t o  the same primitive concept.
The l e x i c a l  entry f o r  ANTI gives anappropriate axiom scheme fo r  the  case i n  which Adjl ANTI A d j ~ :  If Z2 isAdjl then it is not Adj2.Hozd~ (P(Z1,~2,Adjl))  ~otds(P(z~rz~,~~~t(~dj~)))(similarly f o r  adverbs.
)Verbs may be included in this kind of antonymy.
Consider the p a i r slove-hate and open-shut.
For a ch i ld ,  a t  l e a s t ,  "X loves Yt' may implylC.X hates'~."
The appropriate axiom scheme fo r  verbl ANTI verbZ would be:if a s imple  sentence containing verbl is t rue ,  then the negation, i s  t r u ewhen verb2 is  subs t i tu ted  fo r  verblfloZds(R(verbl, Zl, Z*, z3, Z4))~ H ~ l d s ( R ( v e r b ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ , Z ~ , ~ ~ ) )Since such verb pa i r s  do not appear i n  our examples such problematicalinferences have been avoided.There are some important semantic realities here which are not beingcaptured.
There is  a set  of inrnmpatible color  terms: red, orange, peZZow,peen, blue, purple, b r w ,  b h k ,  white.
One can descr ibe  any small a reaof a physical ob j ec t  i n  one of these  terms i f  i t  i s  forbidden t o  use hedgesLike turquoise and pink .
Hot and c o l d ,  l i k e  big and smaZZ, are oppositeends of a scale.
Between hot and c o t d ,  wm?n and cool can be placed some-where.
Binary l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  are not adequate here, Perhaps develop-ments i n  the theory of fuzzy se t s  w i l l  eventually provide a b e t t e r  de-scriptdon.There are l o g i c a l  problems here  too.
I f  the  s t o r y  says t he  toy  isred ,  then we want t o  answer "no" t o  the  question "Is the  toy green?

Lyons discussesthe  sentence reference "A small elephant is  a l a rge  animal."
The currentrepresentat ion fo r  t h a t  sentence i n  pur system would be:Z V l  =Ncorn(elephant,X1) PI =P.P(size,X1 ,small)& =Ncom(animal,X1) P2 =P(size ,XI ,large)For more d e t a i l s  see the  sec t ion  on semantic representat ions .
But 8manANTI large so  w must conclude from P1 t h a t  P(size,X1,Not(large)).
Theproblem i s  that when w e  c a l l  something a small elephant we imply a com-parison with some norm f o r  elephants.
However, this comparison does no?appear i n  our representat ion.
(This di?+i tul ty  has a l s o  been discussedby Bierwisch 1969 and S;Lmmons 1973,)3 . )
Cm~erseness.
This is  Lyons' name fo r  a th i rd  kind of antonymy.A s  examples he gives the pa i r s  buy-se2Z aod husband-&fee  his kind ofoppositeness does not seem to involve negation a t  all.
Rather it in-volves some kind of permutation of the associated individuals.
Dalec a l l s  this r e l a t i on  reciproci ty  and explains it t h i s  way:Buy and se l l  a r e  reciprocals,  a s  a re  give andreceive.
What die  tinguishes these from antonyms(which they are ,  i n  a sense) is tha t  whenever asentence using one of them i s  appropriate, therei s  another appropriate sentence using the othermember of the pair.
For example, John h 9 e  booksfrom Bill has the  same meaning as BiZZ sells booksto John.
He guve flowers t o  her has the samemeaning as She received flowers from him.
This isa s o r t  of "semantic passivet'--like the passivetransformation i n  syntax, it presents the saiiemeaning from a different point of view.
(1972:144)Wether   ale's sentences have exactly the same meaning or  not i s  debatable,but anyone would agree that one implies the  other ,  What is needed i s  somecompact way t o  indicate  what these other appropriate sentences are and t oV derive them when they a r e  needed.
Zolkovsky and ~ei'xuk, (1970) have aclever way of doing t h i s  f o r  verbs.
They use a flotation of the form:Buy CONV (3 2 1 4 )  S e l lto  indica te  tha t% buys Y2 from X3 for X4becomesX sells X2 to  XI f o r  X4 3We have borrowed t h i s  notat ion,  applying i t  t o  cases ra the r  than sub-jec ts  and objects.
It is in te res t ing  t h a t  the  Soviets include regularsyntac t ic  passives i n  t h e i r  discussion of t h i s  r e l a t ion .
Since in t h i ssystesn inferences a r e  made on the  basis of the  f u l l y  formed semantic rep-resentat ions  from which passives have been eliminated, they need not beincluded here.4.)
RecipcaZ Kinship.
Tf w e  had followed Reichenbach (1966) i nt r ea t ing  kinship r e l a t i o n s  as functions of several  arguments then wemc'ouldhave used CONV for  p a i r s  l i k e  husband-wzfe also.
Since kinship and s o c i a lre la t ionships  l i k e  teacher-student are expressed i n  terms of have, however,i t  makes sense t o  pos i t  a  new f e l a t i o n  RECK far RECiprocal Kinship and others o c i a l  terms.
Husband and wife re la t ionships  a r e  represented t h i s  way:Len is Martha's husband, R$%gtve, XI, X2,  husband)Martha is Len's wife R(have,X2,X1,wife)We want t o  b e  able t o  der ive  one of theselsentences from t h e  o ther ,  usingthe  l e x i c a l  information husband RECK wife, i.e.
i f  X1 has X2 as  husbondthen X2 has X1 a s  wife.
The axiom scheme f o r  A WCR B says t h a t  i f  X1 hasX2 a s  A then X2 has XI as B.HoZdaIR(have,X1,X2,A)) HoZds(R(have,X2,X1,B))Ocher kxnds of converseness or  rec iproc i ty  have not occurred o f t e n  e~ought o  warrant a  separate  r e l a t i o n  and a sephrate axiom scheme.
They a r e  en-tered as individual  Inferences i n  each entry.Antonymy seems t o  be a highly diverse  l e x i c a l  concept.

Somehow a l l  t he  d i f f e r en t  kinds of l e x i c a l  informationpreviously decided upon must be neatly packaged i n t o  a compact, con-s i s t e n t ,  and accessible package.
The l e x i ~ o n  1s a l a r g e  network i n  whichthe  nodes are lexical e n t r i e s  and Che a rc s  are l e x i c a l  r e l a t i ons .
Lexi-cal entries can be  found from an alphabet ic  l i s t ,  so t ha t  t h e  networkmay be entered a t  any point.
There is a subnetwork contatlning l e x i c a lr e l a t i ons  and t h e i r  l og i ca l  propert ies .Each entry begins w i t h  the le t tex atring which names it.
Homo-graphs are numbered 1,2,3, ... t o  prevent confusion.
Thus, oZt3arl isthe adject ive ,  clear2 is the verb 'to become cZearlr, and c'learg is theverb ' t b  cause t o  c2earp1 or ' t o  cause to  become cZsmI1.

( i i )  Irregular inflectional morphology.This latter is stated i n  terms of a special set of lexical rela-tions-- PAST, PI?
(past  p a r t i c i p l e ) ,  and PLUR(a1) are the only onesnebded for ou r  simple data-base.
The lexical entry f o r  make includes-PAST - made, - mads.
Made has a separa te  l e x i c a l  entry but a veryshor t  onemude PAST - makePP - makeThe l a i c a l  entry for c h d d  includes PLUR - chzldren, the lexical entryfar  chzZdren consis ts  of:chz Zdren FLUR - chzZd(lii) Lexical r e l a t i o n s  and pointers to thelr values in the fomof attribute-value pairs.
The l e x i c a l  entry f o r  puppy contairk CHILD-- dog.
The lexical  entry f o r  dog contains CHILD - puppy.
The l e x i c a len t ry  for the l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  CHILD tells us  how t o  i n t e r p r e t  these.It contains an axio111 scheme which when f i l l e d  i n  tel ls  us t h a t  X is apuppy i f  and only i f  X i s  a dog and X is young Ncbm(puppy,X) meanst h a t  Ncom(dog,X) and also P(age,X,ygung).

(v) Def init~ons.
These are in the form of logical inferencesthat may be drawn when a ~ i v e n  word is used, and which are idiosyn-cratic enough not to be coded in terms of lexical relations.
Only afew words have definitions.
Puppy, for example, does not becausethe information that a puppy is a young dog 1 s  indicated by the lexi-c a l  relation CHILD - dog.

This system does no t  havethe generalizing power to  use examples effectively and, m addition,they occupy a great deal of space.
The most natural way of handlingexamples in  such a model might be to accumulate tZl- from semantzcrepresentations o f  sentences which the system parses.
The task oforganizing, pruning, and generalizing from examples is  too formidableto tackle here.Nouns: Taxonomy seems to b e  the most important l e x i c a l   elationEor nouns, but many others appear in  the texts as w e l l .dog T mima2 A dog is an animal.cep6 T m a e y  A cent i s  a kind of money.puppy CHILD dog A puppy %s a young dog.

For eqchargument we need four pieces of information:(i) How it IS realized syntactically: subject, object ,or a list of prepositions.
