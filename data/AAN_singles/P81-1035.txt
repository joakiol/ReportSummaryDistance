TRANSPORTABLE NATURAL-LANGUAGE INTERFACES TO DATABASESbyGary G. Hendrlx and William H. LewisSRI International333 Ravenewood AvenueMenlo Park, California 94025I INTRODUCTIONOver the last few years a number ofapplication systems have been constructed thata l low users  to access  databases  by posing quest ionsin natura l  languages, such as Eng l i sh .
When usedin  the res t r i c ted  domains fo r  which they have beenespec ia l l y  des igned,  these systems have achievedreasonably  high leve ls  of performance.
Suchsystems as LADDER \[2\] ,  PLANES \[10\],  ROBOT \[1\],and REL \[9\] requ i re  the encoding of knowledgeabout the domain of app l i ca t ion  in such const ructsas database schemata, lex lcons ,  pragnmtic grammars,and the l l ke .
The c reat ion  of these datas t ruc tures  typ ica l ly  requ i res  cons iderab le  e f fo r ton the par t  of a computer p ro fess iona l  who has hadspecial training in computational l i ngu is t i cs  andthe use of databases.
Thus, the utility of thesesystems is severely limited by the high costinvolved in developing an interface to anyparticular database.This paper descr ibes  in i t ia l  work on amethodology for  c reat ing  natura l - languageprocess ing  capab i l i t i es  for  new domains wi thout  theneed for  in tervent ion  by spec ia l l y  t ra ined  exper ts .Our approach i s  to acqu i re  log ica l  schemata andlex ica l  in format ion  through s imple in teract ived ia logues  with someone who i s  fami l ia r  w i th  theform and content  of the database ,  but un fami l ia rw i th  the technology of natura l - language in ter faces .To tes t  our approach in an ac tua l  computerenvironment,  we have developed a prototype systemca l led  TED (Transpor tab le  Eng l i sh  Datamanager).
Asa resu l t  of our exper ience  with TED.
the NL groupa t  SRI i s  now under tak ing  the develop=ant of a ~chmore ambit ious  system based on the sane ph i losophy\ [4\] .I I  RESEARCH PROBLEMSGiven the demonstrated feas ib i l i ty  oflanguage-access  ystems,  such as LADDER, majorresearch  i ssues  to be dea l t  w i th  in  ach iev ingt ranspor tab le  database in ter faces  inc lude  thefo l low ing:* In format ion  used by t ranspor tab le  systemsmust be c lean ly  d iv ided  into  database-independent and database-dependentpor t ions .
* Knowledge representat ions  must bees tab l i shed  for  the database-dependent  par tin  such a way that  the i r  form i s  f ixed andapp l i cab le  to a l l  databases  and the i rcontent  read i ly  acqu i rab le .
* Mechanisms must be developed to enable thesystem to acqu i re  information about apar t i cu la r  app l i ca t ion f rom non l ingu is ts .I I I  THE TED PROTOTYPEWe have developed our prototype system (TED)to exp lore  one poss ib le  approach to chase problems.In essence ,  TED i s  a LADDER-like natura l - languageprocess ing  system for  access ing  databases ,  combinedwith  an "automated in ter face  exper t "  thatinterviews users to learn the language and logicals t ructure  associated w i th  a par t i cu la r  database andthat  automat ica l ly  ta i lo rs  the system for  use withthe par t i cu la r  app l i ca t ion .
TED a l lows users  toc reate ,  popu la te ,  and ed i t  ~hei r  own new loca ldatabases ,  to descr ibe  ex is t ing  loca l  databases ,  oreven to descr ibe  and subsequent ly  accessheterogeneous (as in  \ [5\])  d i s t r ibuted  databases .Most of TED i s  based on and bu i l t  fromcomponents of LADDER.
In par t i cu la r ,  TED uses theLIFER parser  and i t s  assoc ia ted  support  packages\[3\] ,  the SODA data  access  p lanner  \ [5\] ,  and theFAM f i l e  access  manager \ [6\] .
A l l  of these supportpackages are independent of the par t i cu la r  databaseused.
In LADDER, the data s t ruc tures  used by thesecomponents ~re  hand-generated for  s par t i cu la rdatabase by computer sc ient i s ts .
In TED, however,they are c reated  by TED's automated in ter faceexper t .Like LADDER, TED uses a pragmat ic  granmar; butTED's pragmatic gramemr does not make anyasstmpt lons  about the par t i cu la r  database beingaccessed.
I t  assumes only  that  in teract ions  wi ththe system wi l l  concern data  access  or update,  andthat  in format ion  regard ing  the par t i cu la r  databasew i l l  be encoded in data  s t ruc tures  of a p rescr ibedform, which are c reated  by the automated in ter faceexper t .The execut ive  leve l  of TED accepts  th ree  kindsof input :  quest ions  s ta ted  in  Eng l i sh  about thedata  in  f i l es  that  have been prev ious ly  descr ibedto the system; quest ions  posed in  the SODA querylanguage;  s ing le -~ord  commands that ~nltlaCed ia logues  with the automated in ter face  exper t .zv THE * .Ta~A~ I~r~FAC~ )X~RTA.

* The quest ions  must  be both  br ie f  and easyto unders tand .
* The sys tem must  appear  coherent ,  ellcitingrequ i red  information in an ordercomfor tab le  to  the  user .
* The system must  prov ide  substant ia lass i s tance ,  when needed,  to  enab le  a userto  unders tand  the  k inds  o f  responses  thata re  expected .A l l  these  po in ts  cannot  be covered  here in ,  but  thesample  t ranscr ip t  shown at  the  end of  th i s  paper tin conjunction with the following discussion,suggests  the  manner  o f  our  approach .B.
S t ra tegyA key  s t ra teSy  o f  TED i s  to  f i r s t  acqu i reinformation about  the structure of files.
Becausethe  semantics of files is relatively wellunderstoodt the  system thereby lays the foundationfor subsequently acqu i r ing  information about  thelinguistic constructions likely to  be used inquestions about the data contained in the file.One o f  the  s ing le -word  co - - - -nds  accepted  bythe  TED execut ive  sys tem i s  the  command NEW, wh ichin i t ia tes  a d ia logue  prompt ing  the  user  to  supp lyin fo rmat ion  about  the  s t ructure  o f  a new data  f i l e .The NEW d ia logue  a l lows  the  user  to  th ink  o f  thef i l e  as  a tab le  o f  in fo rmat ion  and asks  re la t ive lys imple  quest ions  about  each  o f  the  f ie lds  (co lumns)in the  file ( tab le ) .For example, TED asks for the heading names ofthe columns, for possible synonyms for the  headingnames,  and  fo r  in fo rmat ion  about  the  types  o fva lues  (numer ic ,  Boo lean ,  o r  symbol i c )  that  eachco lumn can  conta in .
The head ing  names genera l lyac t  l i ke  re la t iona l  nouns ,  wh i le  the  in format ionabout  the  type  o f  va lues  in  each  co lumn prov ides  aclue to the column's semantics.
The heading nameof a symbolic column tends to he the generic namefo r  the  c lass  o f  ob jec ts  re fer red  to  by  the  va lueso f  that  co lumn.
Head ing  names fo r  Boo lean  co lumnstend  co be the  names o f  p roper t ies  that  databaseob jec ts  can possess.
T.f a co lumn contains numbers,thls suggests that there may be some scale wlthassoc ia ted  ad jec t ives  of degree .
To a l low thesys tem to  answer  quest ions  requ i r ing  thein tegrat ion  of information from mult ip le  files, theuser  i s  a l so  asked  about  the  in terconnect ionsbetween the  f i l e  cur rent ly  be ing  def ined  and otherf i l es  descr ibed  prev ious ly .C.
Examples  f rom a Transcr ip tIn  the  sample  t ranscr ip t  a t  the  end o f  th i spaper ,  the  user  in i t ia tes  a NEW d ia logue  at  Po in tA.
The automated  in ter face  exper t  then  takes  thein i t ia t ive  in  the  conversat ion ,  ask ing  f i r s t  fo rthe  name o f  the  new f i le ,  then  fo r  the  names o f  thefile's fields.
The file name wlll be used todlstlngulsh the new file from others during theacquisition process.
The field names are enteredinto the lexicon as the names of attributes and areput on an agenda so that further questions aboutthe fields may be asked subsequently of the user.At this point, TED still does not know whattype of objects the data in the new file concern.Thus, as its next task, TED asks for words thatmight be used as generic names for the subjects ofthe file.
Then, at Point E, TED acquiresInformation about how to identify one of thesesub jects  co the  user  and ,  a t  Po in t  F,  determineswhat  k inds  of  p ronouns  might  be used to  re fer  toone of  the  sub jects .
(As regards  sh ips ,  TED i sfoo led ,  because  sh ips  may be re fer red  to  by "she . "
)TED i s  p rogra - ,~ed wlch the knowledge that theidentifier of an object must be some kind of name,ra ther  than  a numeric quant i ty  or  Boo lean  value.Thus, TED can assume a priori that the NAME fieldgiven in Interaction E is symbolic in nature.
AtPo int  G, TED acquires poss ib le  synonyms fo r  NAME.TED then  cyc les  through a l l  the  o ther  f ie lds ,acqu i r ing  in format ion  about  the i r  ind iv idua lsemant ics .
At Po in t  H, TED asks  about  the  CLASSf ie ld ,  but  the  user  doesn ' t  unders tand  thequest ion .
By typ ing  a quest ion  eu ' rk ,  the  usercauses  TED to  g ive  a more deta i led  exp lanat ion  o fwhat  i t  needs .
Every  quest ion  TED asks  has  a tleas t  two leve ls  of  exp lanat ion  that  a user  mayca l l  upon fo r  c la r i f i ca t ion .
For  example ,  the  useraga in  has  t roub le  a t  J ,  whereupon he rece ives  anextended exp lanat ion  w i th  an  example .
See T a l so .Depend ing  upon whether  a f ie ld  i s  symbol i c ,a r i thnet ic  o r  Boo lean ,  TED makes d i f fe rent  fo rms o fent r ies  in  i t s  lex icon  and seeks  to  acqu i red i f fe rent  types  o f  in fo rmat ion  about  the  f ie ld .For  example ,  as  a t  Po in ts  J ,  K and ?
,  TED askswhether symbolic field values can be used asmodi f ie rs  (usually i n  noun-~oun combinat ions) .
Forar i thmet ic  f ie lds ,  TED looks  fo r  ad jec t ivesassoc ia ted  w i th  sca les ,  as  i s  i l l us t ra ted  by thesequence  0PQR.
Once TED has  a word such  as  OLD, i tassumes  MORE OLD, OLDER and OLDEST may a lso  beused .
(GOOD-BETTER-BEST requ i res  speciali n tervent ion .
)Note  the  aggress ive  use  of prev ious ly  acqu i redinformation i n  formulating new quest ions  to  theuser (as in the use of AGE, and SHIP at Point P).We have found that this aids considerably inkeep ing  the  user  focused  on the  cur rent  i tems ofin teres t  co the  sys tem and he lps  to  keepin teract ions  br ie f .Once TED has  acqu i red  local i n fo rmat ion  abouta new f i le ,  i t  seeks  to  re la te  i t  to  a l l  knownfiles, including the  new file itself.
At Po in ts  Zth rough B+, TED d iscovers  chat  the *SHIP* file maybe Joined with itself.
That is, one of theattrlbutes of a ship is yet another ship (theescorted shlp)j which may itself be described inthe same file.
The need for this information isi l l us t ra ted  by the  query  the  user  poses  a t  Po in tG+.TO bet ter  i l l us t ra te  l inkages  between f i l es ,the  t ranscr ip t  inc ludes  the  acqu is i t ion  o f  a secondfile about ship classes, beginnlng at Point J+ .Much of thls dialogue is omitted but ,  aC L?s TEDl earns  there  i s  a l ink  between the  *SHIP* and*CLASS* files.
At /4+ it l earns  the  d i rec t ion  of160th i s  l ink ;  a t  N+ and O+ i t  l earns  the f ie lds  uponwhich the Jo in  must be made; a t  P+ it l earns  thea t t r ibutes  inher i ted  through the llnk.
Thisi n fo rmat ion  Is  used, for  example, In  answering thequery at  S+.
TED conver ts  the user ' s  quest ion"What I s  the speed of the hoel?"
in to  '~hat  i s  thespeed of the c lass  whose CN~ i s  equal  to theCLASS of the hoe l?
.
"Of course ,  the whole purpose of the NEWd ia logues  i s  to make i t  poss ib le  for  users  to askquest ions  of the i r  databases  in  Eng l i sh .

(2) They use s~tsc t4~/semant ic  a tegor iesthat  support  the processes  of accessln8databases ,  but that  are  domsin-independent and eas i ly  acqu i rab le .I t  is  worth not ing  that ,  even when a psrC lcu la rapp l i ca t ion  requ i res  the in t roduct ion  of Spec ia l -purpose ru les ,  the  bas ic  pragmat lc  grmamar used byTED prov ides  a s ta r t ing  po in t  from whlch domain-spec i f i c  features  can be added.VI DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER WORKThe TED system represents  a f i r s t  s tep  towardt ru ly  por tab le  natura l - language in ter faces  todatabase systems.
TED i s  only  a prototype,however, and --,ch add i t iona l  work w i l l  be requ i red161to provide adequate syntact ic  and conceptualcoverage, as well as to increase the ease withwhich systems may be adapted to new databases.A severe limitation of the current TED systemi s  i t s  res t r i c ted  range of syntact i c  coverage.
Forexample, TED dea ls  only w i th  the verbs BE and HAVE,and does not know about un i t s  (e .g .
,  the Waddel 'sage i s  15.5, not 15.5 YEARS).
To remove th i sl im i ta t ion ,  the SRI NL group i s  cur rent ly  adapt ingJane Robinson's  extens ive  DIAGRAM grammar {7\] fo ruse in  a successor  Co TED.
In p reparat ion  fo r  thela t te r ,  we are  exper iment ing  wi th  verb acqu is i t iondialogues such as the following:> VERBP lease  con jugate  the verb(e.g.
fly flew flown) > EARN EARNED EARNEDEARN is:1 in t rans i t i ve  (John d ines)2 t rans i t i ve  (John eats  d inner )3 d ic rans i t i ve  (John cooks Mary d inner )(Choose the most genera l  pat tern)  > 2who or what is EARNED?

For example,  i f  a databasehas the location of two ships, users will expectthe  system to be ab le  to prov ide  the d i s tancebetween them--an i tem of i n fo rmat ion  not d i rec t ly  7.recorded in  the database ,  but eas i ly  computed fromthe existing data.
In general, any system that istO be wide ly  accepted by users  must not onlyprovide access to primary information, but uasta lso  enhance the la t te r  w i th  procedures  that  8.ca lcu la te  secondary a t t r ibutes  from the dataac tua l ly  s to red .
Data enhancement procedures  a recur rent ly  prov ided by LADDER and a few other  hand-bu i l t  systems,  but work i s  needed now to  dev isemeans for  a l low ing  system users  to spec i fy  the i rown database  enhancement functions and to couple 9.these  wlth the natural-language component.A second issue assoc iated with conceptualcoverage i s  the ab i l i ty  to access  in fo rmat ionext r ins ic  to the database  per  se,  such as where thedata  are s to red  and how the f ie lds  are  de f ined ,  as 10.well as information about the s ta tus  of the querysystem itself.In summary, systems such as LADDER are  ofl im i ted  u t i l i ty  un less  they can be t ranspor ted  tonew databases  by people  w i th  no s ign i f i cant  formalt ra in ing  in computer sc ience .
