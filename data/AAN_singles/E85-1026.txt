TOWARDS A NEW TYPE OF ~.~O~IC ANALY~I~Eva Eoktov~9.
kv~tna 157639001 T~bor, CzechoslovakiaABST~..ACTThe present paper provides a report on2.
new system of an automated morphemicanalysis of technical texts in Czech asa highly inflectional language, which isbeing 2re~oared by the linguistic tes_m ofthe :~cult~ of ~,~athematics and ~hysics inPracae , within the project of man-machinecozununication without a pre-arranged database (TIBAQ).
The kind of morphemicanalysis z~resented here is based ona retrograde (right-to-left) analysis ofwords by means of morphemically unambi-~-uous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends,which do not coincide with the etymologi-cal word-endinjs but correspond to thestructure of the accidental cases ofzorphemic ~.mbiguity in an inflectionallanguage (word-endings being accountablefor in a certain way by word-ends).
Thealgorithm of analysis can thus dispensewith any dictionary (of morphemicirrei-alarities and exceptions), economi-cally accounting especially for productiveword-endings.
The word-ends of theanalysis are assigned several kinds of--.or~hemic.
information, concerningmorphemic categories and le~matization.The analysis is based on the absolute_~ .qL ~.ncy of word-ends in technical texts~nd ic able to interact with the semanticI.

new sL'~tcm of an automated morphemic:tnalyui~ of tec~hnical texts in Czech,:Jhich i~ bein~ 9rei.~ared by the linguisticte~m of th~ ?~culty of :~thematics and-hy~ic~ in ?ra6ue.
The mori;henic snalysisof Czech, which i~ a highly inflectional~.ns-L-~-, constitutes the starting Feintr...,  _,~_ aa~j kind of uuto~autpd Froees~ing oflunLuug~, -~',zncins' fro::: automaticinfor:::e.tion retrieval to natural len~aage~.c~d e ~-s rand ino.There is a ~revious project of mor?he-::-,ic ~nalb'sis of Czech described in(";eisheitelov~, Xr~Ifkov~ and 3gall,I'j829, which is based on an a~n~iLsis ofety~nological word-stems and word-endings(suffixes).
The present system, on ~heother hand, i3 based on a retrograde(right-to-left) analysis of words, whichmakes it possible to disDense bo~h withthe dictionary of stems and the dictiona-ry of endings; it was partly inspired hythe system ~CSAIC (Eirschner, 1982)(intended first of all for automaticindexing of technical texts), which isalso based on a kind of retrogradeanalysis: namely, on s ingl ingcut  thefour rightmost s~umbols of the word-forzsof autosemantic words, which are thenmatched against a list of word-endings.This kind of analysis, however, c~n.notavoid the danger of ambiguity, which isprevented by a n~mber of ad-hccrestrictions, for example reducing theuniverse of discourse.The present system of morDnemxcanalysis differs from the ~revious ene~in several essential respects:(i) The algorithm of the ~resent typeof morphemic analysis can be viewed asa structured list of morp:hemically un-ambiguous or irresolvably ~nbiguousword-ends of Czech words (which may beaccidentally identical with full word-forms) including information concerningtheir morphemic categories and leL~uati-zation.
We believe that this ;rinciylecan be considered as adequate for themorphemic analysis of any inflec~iona!language.
(ii) In the present system, it is alsoeasier to carry out lemmatization: thereare only several tens of sim~le 8ndhighly general le.
"tmatization rulesappended to the morphemic informationaccompanying every word-end in thealgorithm.
(iii) In the present system, the burdenof the analysis lies entirely on thealgoritkm.
There is no need of anydictionary in w.hich etymological irre~u-larities would be listed.
(iv) The algorithm is based on theabsolute frequency of word-ends intec.hnical texts.
It consists of twoparts; the first of them involves abouttwo hundred word-ends by means of whichit is ~ossible to resolve about fiftypercent of a technical text.
(v) ~y means of the algorithm it ispossible to analyze an unlimited number179.of new (newly coined) words with product-ive et~ological word-endings.
Thus, boththe user and the linguist are relieved ofthe work which must be usually done whena new lexical item is being incorporatedinto a system of morphemic analysis of aninflectional language.
(vi) The algorithm is going to beimplemented in PL/1 within a system ofnatural language understanding, namelythe project of man-machine communicationcalled TIBAQ (Text-and-Inference BasedAnswering of Questions, cf.
(Haji~ov@and Sgall, 1981)) with no pre-arrangeddata base and with the capacity of self--enriching by information drawn from thetext; the project is based on thelin~uistic theory of the FunctionalGenerative Description.
(vii) Underlying the algorithm islarge ~aount of empirical work; it~n~lyzes several tens of thousands of(autosemantic and synsemantic) words(dra~ from a retrograde dictionary ofCzech, cf.
(Slavf~kov~, 1975)), includingthe word-foEas of inflected words.
Thechoice of the autosemantic lexical unitsto be analyzed was carried out withrespect to technical texts concerningmicroelectronics.2.
~ PHILCSOPHYOF THE STST~The major novelty of the presentapproach consists in the conception of(morphemically unambiguous or irresol-vably ~nbiguous) word-ends, which do notcorrespond to the (etymological) word--inflection and word-formation endingsbut to the cases of accidental morphemic~nbiguity in an inflectional language,every word-ending being accountable forby at least one word-end (piece of outputinformation).
On the other hand, everyword-end corresponds to (stands for) atleast one lexical word, and due to thecases of morphemic ~mbi~uity, it repre-sents ~t least one word-form.
A word-endi~ usually equivalent to a part of aword-form, "out accidentally it may beequivalent to a full word-form.The algorit~, of analysis, embodyingconception of procedural morphemics,can be viewed as a structured list ofword-ends arranged in a branching struct-ure consisting of ~es-no answers toqueries, with correspon-~ing sequences(strings) of symbols of increasinglength, which is dub to the retrogradeadding of symbols (we use 40 lettersof the Czech alphabet, including theones with diacritics), until morphemi-cally unambiguous or irresolvably~nbiguous word-ends are found (morphemicambiguity counting as a valid result ofthe analysis, since it can be resolved,in most cases, by means of the syntacticanalysis).
The word-ends are assignedthe kinds of information as described insection 3.In the present system of morphemic ana-lysis, there is no place for the notion of(etymological) irregularity, all word-endsbeing equally "regular"; the differencesbetween them can be accounted for e.g.
interms of their length or of their positi-ons on the scale of absolute frequency(cf.
section 5).
It may even be the casethat an etymologically highly irregularword-form can be analyzed by a relativelysmall number of symbols (of its word-end),and the other way round.In the horizontal progress of the algo-rithm (which corresponds to the answerl~nes - a new symbol is added) the outputormation concerns a single word-end,while in the vertical progress (corres-ponding to the answer n oo- different sym-bols than the one(s) in question areadded) it usually concerns more than oneword-end.
These word-ends can be labelledas complementary word-ends with respectto the horizontal word-end(s) in question;they consist of the same sequence ofsymbols as the correlated horizontal word--ends with the exception of their respect-ive leftmost symbols, which belong to thecomplementary set of symbols of the alpha-bet with respect to the leftmost symbol(s)of the horizontal word-end(s), accordingto the combinatorics of letters in exist-ing Czech words (for example, the comple-mentary word-ends to the horizontal word--ends /m~r, dm~r, #m~r are only four:~m~r, ~__~__j.r, omer, ~ (the symbo_ /stands for the end of the word, i.e.
indi-cates a word-end in the form of a fullword-form)).
Throughout the algorithm,the notation concerning the complementaryword-ends is abbreviated in that in theirplace only their common output informat-ion is written (cf.
the three occurrencesof A in Pigure 1 below).The conception just discussed can beillustrated by a chunk of the algorithmaccounting for the frequent word--inflection ending ~ (which is an adje-ctival word-ending, ambiguous among nomi-native and accusative singular masculine--inanimate, and nominative singularmasculine-animate, thus representing theadjectival "normal form,'), which clashesonly with /pr# (adverb), being accountedfor by the three occurrences of the out-put information A (standing for the mor-phemic information in question) in Y~urel.Figure 1.

which are longer than threes~nbols (in Czech, there is only one such~djective, namely k_~ (loose, plump)).Gn the whole, A1, A 2 and A 3 account forall Czech adjectives (in the given form).3.
KINDS OF INFC~ATIONThe word-ends (i.e.
the horizontalword-ends and the complementary word-endswith respect to the given horizontalword-ends) are assigned the followingkinds of information.A.
r~orphemic information.
(i) The information concerning part-of--speech categories includes the distinct-ion between Nouns, Verbs (these kinds ofinformation are further subcategorized),Adjectives (A), Adverbs (B), Prepositions(C), Conjunctiuns (D) and Pronouns (Zj)(there are distinguished three kinds ofpronouns, namely those which function asnouns, those which functiomae adjectives,and those which function both ways).
(ii) The information concerning gram-matical categories includes the followingdistinctions (with respect to the part--of-speech categories).
(a) Declension.
(aa) Case (six cases, indicated as l,2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) is distinguished notonly with nouns, but due to grammaticalagreement, also with adjectives and pro-no Ltns.
(bb) Number (singular and plural, indi-cated as sg and pl, respectively) isdistinguished with nouns, and due togrammatical agreement, also with adjecti-ves, pronouns and verbs.
(cc) Gender (combined with animateness)is distinguished with nouns, and due togrammatical agreement, partly also withadjectives, pronouns and verbs (withverbs, for example, in the past and pas-sive participles plural).
~ith nouns,four genders are distinguished: masculine--inanimate (N), masculine-animate (~),feminine (F), and neuter (S).
The care Tgory of animateness is involved ratherwith masculine then with feminine andneuter nouns because with plural masculi-ne nouns the difference in animateness ispresent, due to grammatical agreement,also with verbs and adjectives in theabove mentioned way, and because in tech-nical texts substantially more masculine--animate than feminine-animate nouns arefound.
(b) Conjugation.With verbs, there is distingtuishedperson (three persons, with the exceptionstated in section 4), number (cf.
(bb)above), tense (present, past and future),mood (indicative and imperative), andvoice (active and passive).
As concernsnotation, usually several kinds of infor-mation are collapsed in a single abbrevi-ation, cf.
K standing for the third per-son singular active indicative present.There is no need of informationconcerning the in/lectional types ofnouns, adjectives and verbs; for examplethe word-ends corresponding to the classof nouns represented by the word-formskatodami (by cathodes) and vlastnostmi(by properties) (both 7 p l )are assignedthe same morphemic information, thoughthe word-forms in question belong toetymologically quite different types ofinflection of (feminine) nouns (of.
thedifference between the word-inflectionendings, ami and m i, respectively).B.
Lemm~tization information.Lemmatizatimn, i.e.
convering an in-flected word-form into the normal form(i.e.
1 sg with nouns, 1 sg masculinewith adjectives and pronouns, and theinfinitive form with verbs) has a speci-fic purpose, being connected with thoseapplications of morphemic analysis whichconcern the terminological elements oftechnical texts (such as automatic inde-xing).In the present system, lemmatizationis carried out by a retrograde erasing ofa certain number of symbols (possiblyzero) and by adding a number of specificsymbols (possibly zero) to what has beenleft after the erasing; in lemmatization(unlike in the rest of the algorithm) wework with diacritic marks as specificsymbols.
In this way, lemmatization canbe accounted for by means of severaltens of simple and highly general rules,cutting across the inflectional endingsand also across the inflectional typesof different part-of-speech categories.It should be pointed out that lemmatizat-ion concerns rather the concrete words(word-forms) found in a text than theword-ends themselves: though the majorityof the lemmatization rules operate onword-ends (concerning usually only a partof a word-end, which is close to a word-181-ending, cf.
the s~mbol y in the word-endto_/~, corres~ondi~g to the word-form.catod~;), in exceFtional cases, ~or examplewhere the stem of a word is affected by analternation, the erasing may reach to theleft of the concrete word, i.e.
behind theword-end; cf.
the word-end s.te (consistingof three symbols), which, with somesimplifications, unambi?uously indicatesa verb (K), but which is not sufficientfor the lem~matization of such verb-formsas roste (grows) to their infinitives~- - ' -~o  ~rcw)), where four rightmests~ls-~-~'~-2~of-the concrete word should beconsidere~.The rules of le~matization have general-ly the form \[X; abc...\], where X standsfor the number of the symbols to beerased, and abe..., for the specificsymbols tc be added.
In the algerithn, therules are usually referred to by numbers,~nd listed in an acoendix.
Thus, forex~nple, ~.~ule 2 (\[1, a\]) converts(cathodes; ~.
2 sg 4 1 ~ 4 pl) in to -~a(oathods; F 1 sg) by erasing one sym-~(mmzely Z) and by adding one symbol(namely a).
(<.

Semantic information.1~ne semantic analysis by me~ns of theretrograde morphemic analysis is s yetunfinished, but presumably smoothlyfeasible task, which will be based on theaccount of productive word-endings bymeans of word-ends.The considerations concerning thesemantic analysis should start fromestablishing a set of semantic categories(classes) of nouns and 9ossibly alsoadjectives which are considered tc berelevant for the analysis of tec~niceltexts.
In addition to the considcr?tionof ~roductive word-endings, there can bealso introduced into the algorit}uu ~uchword-ends which account for semanticzllyrelevant but only restrictedl~- productiveword-for~ation endins~ (such ~s netr(meter)), if such word-ends have been"hidden" in the complementary word-endsof the algorit~hm (for ex2~mple, it mayhappen that a productive word-endinjcoinciding with a single word-end (suchas tko, cf.
below) is "hidden" in thisway~'~.In establishing the set of semenqticcategories t we c~n draw from (~ur~ov&,1980) and \[Kirsc?%er, 1983), vrogesingthat there should be introduced forex~zple the category of Inst~Ament (Tool)(as expressed by the productive word--endings dle, tko, aS, i~, ~ka, 4r, n~and by the restr!cte--~ly proauct~veword-endincs mctr.

.The information concerning semantic182analysis can be rendered by indicatingcertain pieces of output information assemantically relevant (with respect to theclassification of semantic categories),but prssumably it v,:\[ll be oven possible tostate this kind of information essentiallyonly in an appendix to the algorithm.
Such"-:_u appendix should consist of the specifi-cation that every word-end (this concernsalso complementary word-ends) whose right-most symbols coincide with the word-endingin question (because a word-end is usuallylonger than, or identical to, the word-~nding which is accounted for by it) s~dwhich is assigned certain morphemic infor-mation (concerning usually gender)corresfonds to the semantic category inquestion; of.

~IGUI~fThis section brings informationconce~in b (i) c~ses of morphemic dist-inctions not included in the algoritk~;(ii) genuine irresolvable cases, and(iii) co sos of mor\[:hemically irresolvsblemubigmity.
(i) Cases of morphemic distinctions notincluded in the algorithm... We prefer notto include in the algorithm of analysis(with yossible exceptions) morphemicdistinctions concerning these word--inflection endinLs which occur in tech-nical texts only rarelj or not at all,i a r t~c~r~y the following distinctions:Ca) Verbs: 1 sg indicative present(such as ~ed~oklAd&m (I suppose)); 2 sgindicative present (such as p~edroklAdA~(you suppose)); 2 sg imperative (such as(choose)); transgressive forms(such as p~edpokl~da~e, ~ed~okl~dajlc,p~edpoklAdajice (supposing)), and 1 and 2pl imperative are assigned only the morph-emic but not the lemmatization informationbecause these forms are supposed not tobe semantically relevant.
(b) Nouns: 5 sg and pl (such as odbor-nlku!
(expert!)).
(c) Adjectives: masculine-animate pl(such as vzsocl (tall)).
(ii) Genuine irresolvable cases.
By thepresent kind of analysis, there fracti-cally cannot be resolved, in spite oftheir regular inflection, geographicaland personal proper names, their multi-tude preventin~ the linguist fromempirically establishing their (unambi-guous or ~mbiguous) word-ends.
This canbe partly overcome by introducing intothe analysis the recognition of capitalletters and/or by establishing a "rightset" of proper n~mes to be analyzed(which seems to be an easier task withgeograohical names, of.
Evrooa (Zuro~e),rraha ~Prague), etc.).
On thl~ solution,oT'o'r"~xample, the accusative form of ~raha(F), namely Prahu, would yield a case ofmorphemically irresolvable ambiguity withthe locative form of or~h (N; t.hreshold),namely prahu.
Also cer~zn  ~requentpersonal names can be treated in this way(cf.
Schottk~,ho dioda (the diode ofSchottky)).
(iii) Cases of morphemically irresol-vable mmbiguity.
The cases of this kindof am.big~ity concern all of the morphemiccategories as well as lemmatization,occurring singly or as combined in vario~sways.
In what follows, the relevcnt cacosof ~J~biguity arc indicated h j  ~, 3ud theother cases of ambiguity are inducatedby coz~ms or semicolons.
(a) ~mbiguity concerning only Dart-of--speech category; cf.
the ~mbiguity ofthe word-ends corresponding to non--inflected words, such as the ambiguityof the word-end t~ between adverb ~nd~reposition (E ~-'G), t~ standing forseveral words including e.g.
ve~rnit~(inside) or zevnit~ (from inside).
(b) ~tr, biEaity concernin~ \[srt-of-si:eechcategory in combination with ~ther kindsof ~mbiguity; cf.
the ~nbiguity of theword-ends corresponding to inflected.,erda, such a~ ~n~ ~,,b~a~ ~, o :  ~,.~ ..~o~ d-end ~ octw~n no~u and verb (~ l, 4sg ~ Infinitive: growth ~ to ~zrow), orthe ~mbij~it I ~f the word-end ,/rs,rn&between adjective and verb (A ~ ;U l, 4 pl ~ E: direct ~ straightens).183(c) .~mbiguity concerning only gender,cf.
the ambiguity in gender concerningword-inflection endings with adjectives,such as the ambiguity of the word-ends(coinciding, with one exception, withworduinflection endings) ~ch (2, 6 pl) and\[7 pl), which are amblguous amon allw g genders (N ~ ~ % ?
% S).
(d) ~abiguity concerning gender incombination with other kinds of ambiguity:(aa) .~nbiguity concerning gender incombination with case and number, cf.
theword-end /set, which is ambiguous betweenmasculine,inauimate and neuter noun (N l,4 sg % S 2 pl: set ~ of hundreds).
(bb) Surface-syntax ambiguity concern-ing gender in combination with underlying~mbiguity concerning case and number, cf.the word-end /9~dky (lines), which isa;~biguous between masculine-inanimate andfeminine noun (N l, 4, 7 sg ~ F 2 sg; l,4 pl).
This ambiguity in gender, however,is not present on the underlying levelof Czech, where only a single lexicalitem (masculine-inanimate noun) is hypo-thesized to occur, as corresponding tothe two surface normal forms (i.e.masculine-inanimate and feminine), thetwo surface genders accidentally yieldingambiguity in the word-end (word-form)/~dk~.
(cc) Ambiguity concerning gender incombination with animateness (and case),cf.
the word-end /~len (member), which isambiguous between masculine-inanimate andmasculine-animate noun (N l, 4 sg ?1 sg).
(In the majority of the othercases of the inflection of masculinenouns, the ambiguity in animateness isnot accompanied by the case ambiguity.
)(e) Ambiguity concerning only case (andntunber), not accompanied by any otherkinds of ambiguity, cf.
the word-end tody(~ 2 sg ~ I t 4 pl).
(f) Systematic ambiguity concerning thedistinction between geographical namesand possessive adjectives derived fromlexically corresponding personal names,cf.
the word-end /Bene~ova (N 2 sgA N 2 sg; F 1 sg; S l, 4 pl: of Bene~ov~o of Benes s).
(g) Ambiguity concerning lemmatization,cf.
the word-end ~ (K), correspondingto a single word-~- -~v~,  betweenlemmatization rules \[1; t\] and L2; et\],corresponding to the infinitives v~/v~it(to balance) and vyv~et  (to export),respectively.
Cf.
also the surface-syntaxambiguity in lemmatization with theword-end ~ (cf.
(bb) above), whichis surface-s~/s-~ax ambiguous in gender(~\[: ~dek  ~ F: ~dka).The present treatment of ambiguity ischaracteristic of the proceduralconception of morphemics in that themethod of accounting for ever~j etymologi-cal word-ending by means of at least oneword-end (piece of output information)removes from the analysis the systematicambiguity as well as morphemic irregula-rities (exceptions) concerning etymologi-cal word-inflection and word-formationendings, which have been usually treatedby means of various restrictions andother ad-hoc means.
Every case of thesystematic etymological ambiguity isaccountable for by several tens or evenhun eds of pieces of output information(drthecf.
systematic ambiguity of theword-formation ending ac/ as mentioned insection 3, or that of t-~ word-inflectionending~ among masculine-inanimate,masculine-animate and feminine nouns withadditional morphemically irresolvableambiguity concerning case and number:N l, 4 7 pl ?
~ 4, 7 pl ?
F 2 sg; I, 4pl); on the other hand, exceptions toword-endings (in the form of word-endswith different output information) areaccountable for by several pieces ofoutput information (cf.
the word-inflect-ion endin6 ~ as mentioned in section 2,which is accountable for by three piecesof output information, representing oneexception, or the word-formation endingenl as mentioned in section 5, which isa-~ountable for by five pieces of outputinformation, representing six except-ions).After resolving the cases of the syste-matic etymological ambiguity and ofirre?u-larity, it is possible to list theremainir~_ (about one hundred) cases ofmorphemically irresolvable ambiguity(with the exception of the case-numberambiguity accompanying gender ambiguity);such a list can be compared to the listby (Panevov~, 1981) involving.~nbi~ousword-fo~nns in Czech.
Panevov~ s list,not bein& lexically restricted withrespect to specific applications, inclu-des also proper names, words not occur-ring in technical texts and forms notanalyzed by the present algorithm (suchas singular imperative with verbs), buton the other hand, it consists only offull word-forms, thus intersecting withthe present list, where first of allambiguous word-ends in the form of partsof words are involved.5.
QUANTITATIVE ASPECTSThe present conception of the algorithmof morphemic analysis is based on theabsolute frequency of word-ends in tech-nical texts.
In the ideal case, the word--ends should be arranged with respect tothe frequency of their last (rightmost),last-but-one, etc., symbols - a taskwhich itself would require the aid ofa computer; for the time being, we must184work with an approximation, which makesit necessary to divide the algorithm intotwo Farts according to the ass~nptionthat the first two hundred word-ends onthe scale of absolute frequency, arrangedaccording to a statistical examinationconcerning the whole word-ends, couldresolve about fifty ~ercent of the wordsof ~ technical text, while the otherword-ends of the algorithm (pieces ofoutput information), arranged accordingto the frequency of their last sD~bols,should resolve the remaim/~ ;ortion ofa technical text?
We assume that out ofthe about twenty thousand pieces ofoutput information of the broadly concei-ved preliminary version of the algorithm,only several thousands will be sufficientto cover the words which may occur ina standard tecDmical text (this will leadto a substantial reduction of the preli-minary version of the algorithm)?The words included into the analysisfall into four major semantic hyper--categories (not used in the semanticanalysiu): (i) words with the mostgeneral semantics (including the forms ofcate-orial verbs, Such as b_~ (to be),v reo~sitions, such as Z (in), etc.
);(ii) general terms typical of technicaltexts (such as metoda (method),(system), ~tc . )

C, CNCLU~I ON'.Te have described a not yet i::~;-le-lente.fbut i,romising s~steu of a riiht-to-loftmori:hezzic analysis intended ~"  _,~; t~c\]~qlcultexts in Czech a~qd based on c, cence2tionof morphemically tuqambi~J.ous or iz'resol -vably ambi~m/ous word-ends as o.nbodyin~"the cases of nor~henic ~-,;bii~,/ity in auinflectional language.
~"ne present systezuseems to be more  economic than thenrevious systems (which ?.re full?
orpartly based on the conception of et~.nno-logical word-endinjs (and word-stems)oron the conception of word-ends asconsisting of a fixed, apriori establishedntumber of symbols) in that it cen~ disi~ensewith ar~ dictionary as well as with thenotion of morphemic irregularity; more-over, it is capable of an interactionwith the other levels of analysis, aswell as of various adjustments.The advantages of the present systemvis-a-vis the previous systems can besummarized as follows.
(i) Due to the fact that every set ofcomplementary word-ends (with respect tothe tiven horizontal word-end(s)) isassigned a common piece of outf, ut infor-mation, s~d also to the fact that ovena single word-end often corresr:onds toseveral words (lexical units) \]~.nd/orto several word-forms, the ntt~,hcr -,f t!wpieces of output information necessaryfor resolving a standard teclmic~:.!
textis presumably consider~.bly lower than thenumber of the word-forms \[of both inflect-ed and uninflected words) occurrin?
insuch a text.
(ii) The present system is able tcaccount far the word-forms of nay,' (n~;,,l~coined) words with productive we--d--endings automatically, without consi-dering their stems.
(iii) The account of !
:roductive v,'ord--endings also enables to :~cco'~%t forsemantically relevant word-ending~ b UindicatinL the se~nantically relevca~tpieces of output information.185P~F~NCES "!.
