Neurological data from pa-tients with acquired yslexias have been high-lighted to support this claim.
Models using alexicon alone are generally held to be incapableof explaining these data.
However, by selec-tively impairing its component parts, it is easilypossible to account for phonological nd surfacedyslexias using a single-route model based uponpronunciation by analogy.1 In t roduct ionWe have previously developed pronunciation byanalogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud andas a method for automatic phonemisation itext-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper,1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchandand Damper, 2000).
We have also demon-strated (Damper et al, 1999) that the perfor-mance of PbA in producing correct pronunci-ations is vastly superior to manually-writtenrules and significantly better than the competi-tor data-driven techniques of back-propagation(Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; McCulloch etal., 1987) and the IBloIG method based oninformation gain weighting (Daelemans et al,1997).
Although we cannot claim that PbA isabsolutely the best method for pronunciationgeneration, it must be taken seriously.
Thisview is clearly shared by other workers whoare actively developing analogical methods fornatural anguage processing tasks (Pirrelli andFederici, 1995; Jones, 1996; Yvon, 1996; 1997;Bagshaw, 1998; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999).Explicit analogy (e.g., Dedina and Nusbaum,1991; Damper and Eastmond, 1997) retains thelexicon in its entirety, typically as a list of wordsand their spellings.
PbA requires adictionary inwhich text and phonemics have been aligned, sothat pronunciations corresponding to matchingorthographic substrings can be identified.
How-ever, many of the necessary computational stepsto assemble a pronunciation can be carried outin advance.
Thus, in implicit analogy (e.g., Sul-livan and Damper, 1993), the lexical database isprecompiled to yield a generalised phonologicalknowledge base which is consulted uring pro-nunciation generation.
This done, the (explicit)dictionary can be discarded.
Implicit analogymay also attempt to compress the training data,so that some proportion is discarded.Here, we extend earlier work on modellingpronunciation by normal readers to impairedreaders with acquired yslexias.
There are sev-eral forms of this: two of the most importantare phonological nd surface dyslexia.
Casesof phonological dyslexia display good abilityto read words (both regular and irregularly-spelled) aloud but poor nonword reading abil-ity (Beauvois and D~rouesn~, 1979).
In surfacedyslexia, however, patients misread irregularlyspelled words, which tend to be regularised intheir pronunciation (Coltheart et al, 1983).
Tosimulate these dyslexias, we use explicit PbAwithout compression.
The approach is to dam-age the model and then to observe its ability toreplicate the neuropsychological d ta.2 Dua l  and  S ingle Routes  to  SoundThe nature of the cognitive processes underly-ing the act of reading aloud has spawned an im-portant and controversial debate in psychology(Humphreys and Evett, 1985; Seidenberg andMcClelland, 1989; Coltheart et al, 1993; Plautet al, 1996).
One popular view is that there are13two routes from print to sound: a texical and anonlexical route (Coltheart, 1978).
The formerinvolves access to lexical knowledge for familiarwords.
The second route concerns the pronunci-ation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable non-words and is thought o operate on the basis ofa set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules.
Thestrong version of this dual-route theory claimsthat nonwords are segmented at the level of thegrapheme and that the pronunciation of non-words is not influenced by lexical information.A line of evidence generally held to support hemodel comes from neuropsychological studies ofacquired yslexia.
For instance, the patient WBstudied by Funnell (1983) is considered a par-ticularly pure case of phonological dyslexia withgood reading of words and poor reading of non-words.
This case appears to conform to oneof the main predictions of dual-route theory:namely, that neurological damage could selec-tively impair either processing route, so thata patient may have impaired processing in onesystem but intact processing in the other.Nonetheless, the dual-route model has beencriticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980;Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shal-lice et al, 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985;McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who empha-sise that nonword pronunciation can be subjectto lexical influences and/or argue for "multi-ple levels" of processing.
Two main alterna-tives have been proposed to counter these ob-jections: a single-route framework and a modi-fied dual-route model.
The first claims that allprint-to-sound conversion is realised through alexical route.
That is, oral reading involves pro-cesses that all operate on a lexical database sothat words and nonwords can be produced bythe same mechanism.
However, there has some-times been a lack of clarity in defining such asingle-route mechanism.
Often, some kind ofanalogy process is posited, but its precise formhas rarely been specified.
Hence, informed com-mentators have most often been inclined to re-form and repair the dual-route theory by re-laxing its strong assumptions, either to allowan interaction between routes (Reggia et al,1988) or to extend the notion of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (Patterson and Mor-ton, 1985) by introducing the notion of body--the vowel-plus-terminal-consonant segment ofmonosyllabic words.The dual-route model has been more recentlyquestioned by a plethora of single-route com-putational models based on connectionist prin-ciples (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Seiden-berg and McClelland, 1989; Hinton and Shal-lice, 1991; Plaut et al, 1996; Bullinaria, 1997;Ans et al, 1998; Zorzi et al, 1998).
Less oftenhas analogy been used as the basis of a single-route model.
The idea that pseudowords can bepronounced by analogy with lexical words thatthey resemble has a long history (Baron, 1977;Brooks, 1977; Glushko, 1979).
In place of ab-stract letter-to-sound rules in dual-route modelswe have specific patterns of correspondence insingle-route analogy models.3 Imp lement ing  PbAIn PbA, an unknown word is pronounced bymatching substrings of the input to substringsof known, lexical words, hypothesizing a partialpronunciation for each matched substring fromthe phonological knowledge, and assembling thepartial pronunciations.
Here, we use an ex-tended and improved version of the system de-scribed by Dedina and Nusbaum (1991), whichconsists of four components: the (uncompressedand previously aligned) lexical database, thematcher which compares the target input toall the words in the database, the pronuncia-tion lattice (a data structure representing pos-sible pronunciations), and the decision func-tion, which selects the 'best' pronunciationamong the set of possible ones.
The lexi-con used is Webster's Pocket Dictionary, con-taining 20,009 words manually aligned by Se-jnowski and Rosenberg (1987) for training theirNETtalk neural network.Pat tern  Match ing :  An incoming word ismatched in turn against all orthographic en-tries in the lexicon.
For a given entry, assumethe process starts with the input string andthe dictionary entry left-aligned.
Substringssharing contiguous, common letters in match-ing positions are then found.
Information aboutthese matching letter substrings and their cor-responding, aligned phoneme substrings in thedictionary entry under consideration is enteredinto a pronunciation lattice--see below.
Oneof the two strings is then shifted right by oneletter and the matching process repeated, until14some termination condition is met.
This processcan be alternatively seen as a matching betweensubstrings of the incoming word, segmented inall possible ways, and the dictionary entries.P ronunc ia t ion  Latt ice:  A node of the lat-tice represents a matched letter, Li, at someposition, i, in the input.
The node is labelledwith its position index i and with the phonemewhich corresponds to Li in the matched sub-string, Rim say, for the mth matched substring.An arc is placed from node i to node j if thereis a matched substring starting with Li andending with Lj.
The arc is labelled with thephonemes intermediate between Pim and Pjmin the phoneme part of the matched substring.Additionally, arcs are labelled with a 'frequency'count which is incremented each time that sub-string (with that pronunciation) is matchedduring the pass through the lexicon.Decis ion Funct ion:  A possible pronuncia-tion for the input corresponds to a com-plete path through its lattice, from Start toEnd nodes, with the output string assembledby concatenating the phoneme labels on thenodes/arcs in the order that they are traversed.
(Different paths can, of course, correspond tothe same pronunciation.)
Scoring of candidatepronunciation uses two heuristics.
If there isa unique shortest path, then the correspond-ing pronunciation is taken as the output.
Ifthere are tied shortest paths, then the pronunci-ation corresponding to the best scoring of theseis taken as the output.This also offers a way of simulating the 'wordsegmentation' test of Funnell (1983), in whichpatients have to find words 'hidden' in letterstrings.
First, there is an initial segmentationin which the input string is segmented in allpossible ways, as in 'regular' PbA.
Then, ifany of these substrings produces a lattice witha length-1 arc, this identifies a lexical word.A single-route connectionist model or abstractrules (or, for that matter, implicit PbA) can notdo this without some extension to maintain ex-plicit knowledge of lexical status.
Of course, itis possible that a patient can perform the firstof these steps, but not the second.
This is thedifference between our 'unconscious' and 'con-scious' segmentations (see below) so-called be-cause, in the latter, the patient is aware thathe/she has to find a hidden word.This particular implementation f PbA doesnot guarantee an output pronunciation.
A com-plete path through the lattice requires that allnodes on that path (except the first and last)are linked by at least one arc.
Clearly, each arcmust have a node at either end.
Although anarc may have an empty label, a node cannot.Hence, the minimum matching segment lengthcorresponds to a letter bigram.
It may be thatno matching bigram exists in some cases.
Sothere with be no complete path through the lat-tice and no pronunciation can be inferred--the'silence problem'.Recent  Improvements :  The implementa-tion used here features several enhancementsover the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&N)system (Marchand and Damper, 2000).
First,we use 'full' pattern matching between inputletter string and dictionary entries, as opposedto the 'partial' matching of D&N.
That is,rather than starting with the two strings left-aligned, we start with the initial letter of theinput string Z aligned with the last letter ofthe dictionary entry YV.
The matching processterminates not when the two strings are right-aligned, but when the last letter of Z alignswith initial letter of \]/Y.
Second, multiple (five)heuristics are used to score the candidate pro-nunciations.
Individual scores are then multi-plied together to produce a final overall score.The best-scoring pronunciation is then selectedas output.
Marchand and Damper show thatthis 'multi-strategy' approach gives statisticallysignificant performance improvements over sim-pler versions of PbA.4 Mode l l ing  Phono log ica l  Dys lex iaBy selective impairment of component partsof the PbA model, we have simulated read-ing data from the two phonological dyslexic pa-tients (WB and FL) studied by Funnell (1983).
(The reader is referred to this original source forspecifications of the tests and materials.)
Whilethe first of these patients has often been citedas a key individual strongly supporting dual-route theory, we believe that FL (who has beenlargely ignored) is actually a counter-example.FL was unable to supply a sound for singleletters (which argues that the abstract rule-based route is impaired) although she couldread non-words normally (which contradicts the15Table 1: Reading performance of patient WB and versions of faulty and non-faulty PbA.

Version 1 sup-poses that brain damage has induced a partialloss of words from his mental exicon (the 15%that he can not read aloud) and a total break-down of his concatenation mechanism.
Ver-sion 2 supposes that WB's impairment resultsfrom injury to one component only; namely, theprocess of segmentation i to all possible sub-strings is partially damaged.
In Version 2, westress the distinction made earlier between thisbasic (unconscious) segmentation process andFunnell's (conscious) segmentation.
The un-conscious egmentation is that embodied in thePbA pattern matching when WB is asked toread some string.
For this specific patient, wepostulate damage to the segmentation compo-nent such that it can only process ubstrings oflength between 5 and 7.
The conscious egmen-tation is that used when WB is asked to findwords within strings and to read them aloud.This process is assumed to be fully operational.For patient FL, a single 'faulty' version of PbAhas been developed which postulates a deft-ciency of (unconscious) egmentation such thatsubstrings of length less than three cannot beused in pattern matching.Table 1 shows reading accuracy for pa-tient WB for the various tests performed byFunnell together with the corresponding resultsof simulations of impaired and non-faulty PbA.Table 2 shows the results for patient FL read-ing aloud and the corresponding simulation offaulty and non-faulty PbA.
Evidently, it ispossible to reproduce quite well both patients'symptoms.
Indeed, with Version 1, we can in-terpret WB's condition very directly: The con-catenation process involved in nonword readingis completely destroyed but the mental exiconis relatively spared.
Because of the absence ofsome compound words (e.g., gentlelman ) fromthe dictionary, the simulations concerning "par-ent words" (e.g., father is the parent of.fat andher) for both Test 1 and Test 2 are not perfect.Version 2 is slightly poorer but still close to theneuropsychological d ta.
For patient FL, thefaulty version reproduces her impaired readingof single letters and 'easy' nonwords very well,but does so less well for 'difficult' nonwords.16The simulations also handle the fact that thesepatients were completely unable to read singleletters: the silence problem (see above) can oc-cur for single letters by virtue of the form ofthe pronunciation lattice used, which requiresmatching bigrams (at least) at all positions toproduce a pronunciation.5 Modelling Surface DyslexiaWe have also modelled data from patient KTdescribed by McCarthy and Warrington (1986).KT was able to pronounce regular words andnonwords very well but had serious difficulty inreading irregular words, tending to produce reg-ularisation errors.
(Again, limitations of spacemean we must refer the reader to the originalsource for details of the reading tests and mate-rials.)
Together with WB, these patients havebeen taken as almost an existence proof of dualroutes which can be differentially damaged.We suppose that KT's impairment re-sults from injury to two components of thePbA model.
First, as in phonological dyslexia,we assume that the process of segmentationinto all possible substrings is partially dam-aged.
More specifically, we postulate a defi-ciency concerning the size of the window in-volved in the pattern matching.
Second, it isassumed that one or several (of the total of five)multi-strategies may be degraded.The simulations were obtained for a modelwith damage in the third and fourth multi-strategies (see Marchand and Damper, 2000,for detailed specification) and only substringsof length between 2 and 4 can be segmented inpattern matching.
Table 3 shows KT's meanreading accuracy over the various tests per-formed by McCarthy and Warrington togetherwith our corresponding simulation results forimpaired and non-faulty PbA.
Clearly, it is pos-sible to reproduce quite well the patient's car-dinal symptoms: his ability to pronounce regu-lar words much better than irregular ones.
Theincorrect pronunciations show a clear regulari-sation effect (not detailed here).6 ConclusionContrary to the claims of dual-route theorists,a single-route PbA model of reading is indeedable to explain both phonological and surfacedyslexia, on the basis of selective impairment ofits component parts.ReferencesB.
