PROPOSALS FOR A HIERARCHY OF FORMAL TRANSLATION MODELSKlaus-Jurgen EngelbergUniversitat Konstanz, Philosophische Fakult~t, FachgruppeSprachwissenschaft, BRDThe present deplorable state-of-the-art in the field ofmachine translation seems greatly due to a fundamental laokof formal translation models needed in natural language pro-cessing.From the methodological point of view it appears difflo-ult to delineate a borderline between translation theory andmodern theoretical lingu~stlos (availing itself of modeltheoretical semantics) or full natural language understandingsystems as developed in Artificial Intelligence research.
Itseems plausible to postulate that any prospective translationtheory should draw on ideas from both fields.
Unfortunately,problems discussed in painstaking detail in linguistics likedifferences in quantifier scope appear to be of lesser concernto a translator (since these ambiguities may well remain pres-ent in the target language) , neither seems a full or deepunderstanding necessary in many cases, standard syntacticphrasing may suffice.
More specifically, we regard the pro-blems of disambi~ation, mandatory insertion of lexical itemsnot conventionally implied in the source language and corefer-ence/anaphora resolution as the crucial problem areas ofmachine translation.In this paper, we will endeavour - in this preliminarydraft only in a very sketchy manner - to set up a hierarchy offormal translation models ordered according to their inoreas-- 90  -i ng  sys temat ic  d i sambiguat ion  power fo r  cer ta in  types oftexts .Quite analogous to comple.xity cons iderat ions  in  mathe-mat ics ,  the power of  a t rans la t ion  system i s  assumed to bemeasured by the  amount of s to rage  needed fo r  the lex ioa l  com-ponent (A~-people mAght ca l l  th i s  long-term-memory) and/orfo r  the t rans ient  or  dynamic data  (short - term-memory)  bu i l t  upduming the in terpret ing  process of  a par t i cu la r  text .
Anymodel w i l l  be capable  %o t rans la te  only  cer ta in  res t r i c tedtypes  of  texts  in  a sys temat ic  manner and wi th  sa t i s fac toryresu l t s ,  but the idea  i8  that  any model w i l l  a l so  conta incomponents of  lower  leve ls  of  complex i ty .

Processing of thesetexts could be done by semantic finite state automata thatwould accept only highly constrained discourses in which noabrupt shifts of focus would be allowed.
At last at this levelof complexity It seems necessary to assume that the vocabularyshould be organized - in addition to the usual lexioographlc- 92  -order  - as  a sor t  o f  semant ic  network  conta in ing  a l l  types  o fsense  re la t ions  l i ke  super -subset  re la t ion ,  antonymy,  conver - -seness ,  t ime-sequence  - ex i s t ing  even  between severa l  p lacesverbs .Leve l  Se~:  T rans la t ions  us ing  s tory  t reesThese  mode ls  dynamica l ly  bu i ld  up a t ree - l i ke  maorest ructu~efo r  a text  in  wh ich  arb i t ra ry  deep embedd ings  o f  themes  andsub- themes  are  represented .

A semantic network as the dynsmlc macro-structure of & text would allow for multiple views or thema-tic structures associated with a portion of a text.
To makethis effective, a very rloh fabric of various types of assoc-iative links would be needed in the database.Level Sere5: 1~rsmevbased translations"Frames" or "scripts" have been widely discussed in the AIcon:mx~ity In  the  past  10 years  o r  so .
