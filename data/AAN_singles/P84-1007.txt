THE REPRESENTATION OF CONSTITUENT STRUCTURES FOR FINITE-STATE PARSINGD.
Terence  LangendoenYed ldyah LangsamDepartments of English and Computer & Information ScienceBrooklyn College of the City University of New YorkBrooklyn, New York 11210 U.S.A.ABSTBACTA mixed prefix-postfix notation for repre-sentations of the constituent structures of theexpressions of natural languages is proposed,which are of limited degree of center embedding ifthe original expressions are noncenter-embedding.The method of constructing these representationsis applicable to expressions with center embed-ding, and results in representations which seem toreflect the ways in which people actually parsethose expressions.
Both the representations andtheir interpretations can be computed from the ex-pressions from left to right by finite-state de-v ices .The class of acceptable expressions of a na-tural language L all manifest no more than asmall, fixeR, finite degree n of center embedding.From this observation, it fo~lows that the abilityof human beings to parse the expressions of L canbe modeled by a finite transducer that associateswith the acceptable expressions of L representa-tions of the structural descriptions of those ex-pressions.
This paper considers some initialsteps in the construction of such a model.
Thefirst step is to determine a method of represen-ting the class of constituent structures of theexpressions of L without center embedding in sucha way that the members of that class themselveshave no more than a small fixed finite degree ofcenter embedding.
Given a grammar that directlygenerates that class of constituent structures, itis not difficult to construct a deterministic fi-nite-state transducer (parser) that assigns theappropriate members of that class to the noncen-ter-embedded expressions of L from left to right.The second step is to extend the method so that itis capable of representing the class of constitu-ent structures of expressions of L with no morethan degree n of center embedding in a mannerwhich appears to accord with the way in which hu-man beings actually parse those sentences.
Givencertain reasonable assumptions about the characterof the rules of grammar of natural languages, weshow how this step can also be taken.
*This work was partly supported by a gran t fromthe PSC-CUNY Faculty Research Award Program.Let G be a context-free phrase-structuregrammar (CFPSG).
First, suppose that the categoryA in G is right-recursive; i.e., that there aresubderivations with respect to G such thatA ==~ X A, where X is a nonnull string of symbols(terminal, nonterminal, or mixed).
We seek a newCFPSG G*, derived from G, that contains the cate-gory A* (corresponding to A), such that there aresubderivations with respect to G* of the formA* ==8 X* A*, where X* represents the constituentstructure of X with respect to G. Next, supposethat the category B in G is left-recursive; i.e.,that there are subderivations with respect to Gsuch that B ==~ B Y, where Y is nonnull.
We seeka new CFPSG G*, derived from G, that contains thecategory B* (corresponding to B), such that thereare subderivations with respect to G* of the formB* ==~ B* Y*, where Y* represents the constituentstructure of Y with respect to G. In other words,given a grammar G, we seek a grammar G* that di-rectly generates strings that represent the con-stituent structures of the noncenter-embedded ex-pressions generated by G, that is right-recursivewherever G is right-recursive and is left-recur-sive wherever G is left-recursive.In order to find such a G*, we must first de-termine what kinds of strings are available thatcan represent constituent structures and at thesame time can be directly generated by noncenter-embedding grammars.
Full bracketing diagrams arenot suitable, since grammars that generate themare center embedding whenever the original gram-mars are left- or right-recursive (Langendoen1975).
Suppose, however, that we leave off rightbrackets in right-recursive structures and leftbrackets in left-recursive structures.
In right-recursive structures, the positions of the leftbrackets that remain indicate where each constitu-ent begins; the position where each constituentends can be determined by a simple counting pro-cedure provided that the number of daughters ofthat constituent is known (e.g., when the originalgrammar is in Chomsky-normal-form).
Similarly,in left-recursive structures, the positions of theright brackets that remain indicate where eachconstituent ends, and the position where each con-stituent begins can also be determined simply bycounting.
Moreover, since brackets no longer oc-cur in matched pairs, the brackets themselves canbe omitted, leaving only the category labels.
Inleft-recursive structures, these category symbolsoccur as postfixes; in right-recursive structures,24they occur as prefixes.
Let us call any symbolwhich occurs as a prefix or a postf ix in a stringthat represents the const ituent structure of anexpression an affix; the strings themselves af -f ixed strings; and the grammars that generatethose strings affix gra1~ars.To see how aff ix grammars may be constructed,consider the noncenter-embedding CFPSG GI, whichgenerates the art i f icial  language L1 = a(b*a)*b*a.

(El) abbaba(El*) SaABbABbAaSABbAaSLet us say that an aff ix covers  elements inan aff ixed string which correspond to its consti -tuents (not necessari ly immediate).
Then El* maybe interpreted as a structural descript ion of E1with respect to GI according to the rules in R,in which J, K, and L are affixes; k is a word; xand y are substrings of aff ixed strings; and G isa CFPSG (in this case, GI).
(R) a.
If K ~ k is a rule of G, then inthe conf igurat ion ... K k ..., K isa pref ix which covers k.b.
If J ~ K L is a rule of G, thenin the conf igurat ion ... J K x L ...,in which x does not contain L, J isa prefix which covers K L.c?
If J d K L is a rule of G, then inthe conf igurat ion ... K x L y J ...,in which x does not contain L and ydoes not contain K, J is a postf ixwhich covers K L.Coverage of constituents by the rules in R may bethought to be assigned dynamical ly from left toright.A postf ix is used in rule Gl*a because thecategory S is left-recursive in GI, whereas a pre-fix is used in rule Gl*b because the category A isr ight-recursive in GI.
The use of pref ixes inrules Gl*c-e, on the other hand, is unmotivated ifthe only criteria for choosing an aff ix type haveto do with direct ion of recursion.
For aff ixgrammars of natural languages, however, one canmotivate the decision to use a part icular type ofaff ix by pr inciples other than those having to dowith direction of recursion.The use of a pref ix can be interpreted as in-dicating a decision (or guess) on the part of thelanguage user as to the identity of a part icularconstituent on the basis of the identity of thefirst constituent in it.
Since lexical items areassigned to lexical categories essential ly as soonas they are recognized (Forster 1976), we may sup-pose first that prefixes are used for rules suchas those in Gl*c-e that assign lexical items tolexical categories.
Second, if, as seems reason-able, a decision about the identity of const itu-ents is always made as soon as possible, then wemay suppose that prefixes are used for all rulesin which the leftmost daughter of a part icularconstituent provides suff icient evidence for theidenti f icat ion of that constituent; e.g., if theleftmost daughter is either the specif ier or thehead of that constituent in the sense of Jacken-doff (1977).
Third, we may suppose that even ifthe leftmost daughter of a part icular constituentdoes not provide suff icient evidence for the iden-t i f icat ion of that constituent,  a pref ix may stillbe used if that constituent is the left sister ofa constituent that provides suff icient evidencefor its identif ication.
Fourth, we may supposethat postf ixes are used in all other cases.To i l lustrate the use of these four pr in-ciples, consider the noncenter-embedding partialgrammar G2 that generates a fragment of Engl ishthat we call L2.

Rule G2*ai conforms to the third principle,according to which a category appears as a prefixif its presence can be predicted from its rightsister in G2.
Finally, rules G2*aii,c,d conformto the fourth principle, according to which a ca-tegory appears as a postfix if it cannot appear asa prefix according co the preceding three prin-ciples.The affixed string that G2* generates as therepresentation of the structural description of E2with respect to G2 is given in E2*.

(This restriction is needed to prevent the postfixS in E2* from simply covering any of the subordi-nate clauses in that expression.)
It is worthnoting how the application of those rules dynami-cally enlarges the NP that is covered by the S prefixthat follows the words knew that.
First the tea-cher is covered; then the teacher's sister; thenthe teacher's sister's neighbor; and finally theteacher's sister's neighbor's friend.The derivation of E2* manifests first-degreecenter embedding of the category S*, as a resultof the treatment of S as both a prefix and a suf-fix in G2*.
However, no derivation of an affixedstring generated by G2* manifests any greater de-gree of center embedding; hence, the affixedstrings associated with the expressions of L2 canstill be assigned to them by a finite-state parser.The added complexity involved in interpreting E2*results from the fact that all but the first ofthe NP-VP sequences in E2* are covered by prefixSs, so that the constituents covered by the post-fix S in E2* according to rule Rc are considerablyfar away from it.It will be noted that we have provided twologically independent sets of principles by whichaffixed grammars may be constructed from a givenCFPSG.
The first set is explicitly designed topreserve the property of noncenter-embedding.
Thesecond is designed to maximize the use of prefixeson the basis of being able to predict the identityof a constituent by the time its leftmost descen-dent has been identified.
There is no reason tobelieve a priori that affixed grammars constructedaccording to the second set of principles shouldpreserve noncenter-embedding, and indeed as wehave just seen, they don't.
However, we conjec-ture chat natural languages are designed so thatrepresentations of the structural descriptions ofacceptable expressions of those languages can beassigned to them by finite-state parsers that op-erate by identifying constituents as quickly aspossible.
We call this the Eff ic ient  F in i te-State  Parser  Hypothes is .The four principles for determining whetherto use a prefix or a postfix to mark the presenceof a particular constituent apply to grammars thatare center embedding as well as to those that arenot.
Suppose we extend the grammar G2 by replac-ing rules G2e and f by rules G2e' and f' respec-tively, and adding rules G2m-s as follows:(G2) e'.

(E3) a. the boss knew that the teacher sawthe child yesterdayb.
the friend of the teacher's sister26Although each of the expressions in E3 is am-biguous with respect to G2, each has a stronglypreferred interpretation.
Moreover, under eachinterpretation, each of these sentences manifestsfirst-degree center embedding.
In E3, the includ-ed VP saw the child is wholly contained in the in-cluding VP knew that the teacher saw the childyesterday; and in E3b, the included NP the teacheris wholly contained in the including NP the friendof the teacher's sister.Curiously enough, the extension of the affixgrammar that our principles derive from the exten-sion of the grammar G2 just given associates onlyone affixed string with each of the expressions inE3.
That grammar is obtained by replacing rulesG2*e and F with G2*e' and f' respectively, and ad-ding the rules G2*m-s as follows.

NP D the N N friend PP1 P1 of NP Dthe N N teacher G 's  G N N sister NPWe contend that the fact that the expressionsin E3 have a single strongly preferred interpreta-tion results from the fact that those expressionshave a single affixed string associated with them.Consider first E3a and its associated affixedstring E3*a.
According to rule Rc, the affix VPfollowing yesterday is a postfix which covers theaffixes VP and A.
Now, there is only one occur-rence of A in E3*a, namely the one that immediate-ly precedes yesterday; hence that must be the oc-currence which is covered by the postfix VP.
Onthe other hand, there are two occurrences of pre-fix VP in E3*a that can legitimately be covered bythe postfix, the one before saw and the one beforeknew.
Suppose in such circumstances, rule Rcpicks out the nearer prefix.
Then automaticallythe complex VP, saw the child yesterday, is co-vered by the subordinate S prefix, in accordancewith the natural interpretation of the expressionas a whole.Next, consider E3b and its associated affixedstring E3*b.
According to rule Rc, the G is apostfix that covers the affixes NP and G. Two oc-currences of the prefix NP are available to becovered; again, we may suppose that rule Rc picksout the nearer one.
If so, then automatically thecomplex NP, the teacher's sister, is covered byPPI, again in accordance with the natural inter-pretation of the expression as a whole.This completes our demonstration of the abil-ity of affixed strings to represent the structuraldescriptions of the acceptable sentences of a na-tural language in a manner which enables them tobe parsed by a finite-state device, and which alsopredicts the way in which (at least) certain ex-pressions with center embedding are actually in-terpreted.
Much more could be said about the sys-tem of representation we propose, but time andspace limitations preclude further discussionhere.
We leave as exercises to the reader thedemonstration that the expression E4a has a singleaffixed string associated with it by G2*, and thatthe left-branching (stacked) interpretation of E4bis predicted to be preferred over the right-branching interpretation.
