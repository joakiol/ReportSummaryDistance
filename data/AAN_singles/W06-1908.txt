Dialogue based Question Answering System in TeluguAbstractA dialogue based Question Answering(QA) system for Railway information inTelugu has been described.
Telugu is animportant language in India belonging tothe Dravidian family.
The main compo-nent of our QA system is the DialogueManager (DM), to handle the dialoguesbetween user and system.
It is necessaryin generating dialogue for clarifying par-tially understood questions, resolvingAnaphora and Co-reference problems.Besides, different modules have been de-veloped for processing the query and itstranslation into formal database querylanguage statement(s).
Based on the re-sult from the database, a natural languageanswer is generated.
The empirical re-sults obtained on the current system areencouraging.
Testing with a set of ques-tions in Railway domain, the QA systemshowed 96.34% of precision and 83.96%of dialogue success rate.
Such a questionanswering system can be effectively util-ized when integrated with a speech inputand speech output system.1 IntroductionEver since Question Answering (QA) emerged asan active research field, the community hasslowly diversified question types, increasedquestion complexity, and refined evaluation met-rics, as reflected by the TREC (Text RetrievalConference) QA track (Voorhees, 2004).
SeveralQA systems have responded to these changes inthe nature of the QA task by incorporating vari-ous knowledge resources (Hovy et al, 2002),handling of additional types of questions tappinginto external data sources such as web, encyclo-pedia, and databases in order to find the answercandidates, which may then be located in thespecific corpus being searched (Xu et al, 2003).The most popular classes of technique forQA are open-domain and restricted-domain(Diekema et al, 2004, Doan-Nguyen et al,2004).
These two domains use thesauri and lexi-cons in classifying documents and categorizingthe questions.
Open domain question answeringdeals with questions about nearly everything andcan only rely on general ontology.
It has becomea very active research area over the past fewyears.
On the other hand, Restricted-domainquestion answering (RDQA) deals with ques-tions under a specific domain.
If we create such aRDQA interface for structured e.g.
relationaldatabase, we call it as Natural language interfaceto database system (NLIDB) (Androutsopouloset al, 1995), where it allows the user to accessthe information stored in database by typing re-quests expressed in some natural language.RDQA has a long history, beginning with sys-tems working over databases (e.g., BASEBALL(Green et al, 1961), and LUNAR (woods et al,1972)).In practice, current QAs can only understandlimited subsets of natural language.
Therefore,some training is still needed to teach the end-userwhat kinds of questions the system can or cannotunderstand.
There are kinds of questions (e.g.questions involving negation, or quantification)that can be easily expressed in natural language,but that seem difficult (or at least tedious) to ex-press using graphical or form based interfaces.Anaphoric and elliptical expressions are alsohandled by the QA systems.
In recent years alarge part of the research in QAs has been de-voted to portability, i.e., to the design of QAsthat can be used in different knowledge domainsRami Reddy Nandi ReddyDept.

There is a growing body of research onintegrating speech recognition, robust interpreta-tion with the goal being to implement systemsthat engage users in spoken dialogue to helpthem perform certain tasks.
We expect that thisline of research will have a significant influenceon future QAs, giving rise to systems that willallow users to access databases by spoken dia-logue, in situations for which graphic and form-based interfaces are difficult to use.A practical question answering system in re-stricted domain (Hoojung et al, 2004) and oursystem handles user questions similarly.
How-ever, our system extracts the information from arelational database.
Moreover, our system keepstrack of user dialogue and handles clarifications,elaborations and confirmations needed from theuser with respect to the query.
Along with it re-turns natural language answer in user-friendlyformat.ARISE (Automatic Railway Information Sys-tem for Europe) is a spoken dialogue system toprovide train timetable information over thephone.
Prototypes have been developed in fourlanguages: Dutch, French, English, and Italian.ARISE uses a mixed initiative Dialogue Manager(DM).
A mix of implicit and explicit confirma-tion is used, based on how confident the systemis in deciding whether an item has been correctlyunderstood.We relate this paper as an experiment for de-signing a keyword based QA system for a hugedomain (i.e.
for Railways), which aims at reply-ing users questions in their native language (Te-lugu).
The system generates SQL query out ofthe natural language question, executes the SQLquery over a relational database and then providethe answer.
Dialogue Manager (DM) is main-tained to generate dialogues with user and tohandle the anaphoric and elliptical expression inour query.
This system is implemented on a rela-tively restricted domain that includes a numberof aspects of railway information system (Arri-val/Departure time, Fare between for particularstations, Trains between important stations etc.
).The precision of the information extraction stageis essential to the success of a QA system, be-cause it places an upper bound on the precisionof the entire system.The empirical results obtained on the currentsystem are encouraging.
Testing with a set ofquestions in Railway domain, the QA systemshowed 96.34% of precision and 83.96% of dia-logue success rate.Section 2 deals with the System Architectureof the QA system.
Section 3 details about the QAsystem design in the Railway information do-main using the Keyword based approach.
Theevaluation has been carried out in Section 4.
Sec-tion 5 concludes with some directions for futurework.2 System ArchitectureIn this keyword based approach the input querystatement is analyzed by the query analyzer,which uses domain ontology stored as knowl-edge base, generating tokens and keywords.
Theappropriate query frame is selected based on thekeywords and the tokens in the query statement.Each query frame is associated with a SQL gen-eration procedure.
The appropriate SQL state-ment(s) is generated using the tokens retrievedfrom the input query.The QA system architecture is shown in Fig-ure 1.
The Dialogue Manager keeps track of theelliptical queries from the user that constitute thedialogue and helps in the SQL generation proce-dure using dialogue history (Flycht-Erikson etal., 2000), which contains information about pre-vious tokens and their types as well as other dia-logue information like answers retrieved by thecurrent SQL statements and the answers for pre-vious queries in the dialogue.
The SQL state-ments used to retrieve the correct answer fromthe database.
Based on the result of the DBMS,a natural language answer is generated.
This an-swer is forwarded to the DM for onward trans-mission to the user.Figure 1.
QA System ArchitectureEACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA0654If the system cannot decide on the query frameby using the keywords extracted from the inputquery, the system enters into a dialogue with theuser through the DM.
During SQL generation ifit is detected that more information is neededfrom the user to generate the SQL statement thenan interactive message is sent to the user throughthe DM.
The user will then send the needed in-formation to the system.
If user could not pro-vide correct information then DM sends an errormessage to the user indicating the error in theuser query.
In case, the SQL statement generatesa null response from the database the DM willsend a cooperative message depending on theuser query.3 Design of Railway Information Sys-temThe most important issue in the design of theRailway information system is the design of theRailway database and the Knowledge base.These are detailed in Sections 3.1 & 3.2 respec-tively.
The different components of the dialoguebased QA system, i.e., Query Analyzer, QueryFrame Decision, Dialogue Manager, SQL Gen-eration and Answer Generation sub systems aredescribed in subsequent sections.3.1 Railway Database ManagementThe system as a whole is engaged in data access,and is a hybrid system with subsystem to analyzethe natural language query and formal query lan-guage SQL, and a data retrieval and databasemanagement system.
The database is structuredand contains the information to provide the rail-way information service.
For example in a Rail-way information system, database contains in-formation about the arrival/departure time oftrains, their fares and their running informationetc.
The aim of database management is to de-scribe the information, in order to offer the ser-vice.For our purposes the relational model has im-portant advantage: The relational model stresseson data independence.
This means that the userand front-end programs are effectively isolatedfrom the actual database organization.The main tables used here are schedule tablefor each train, fare tables for special trains likeRajdhani, Shatabdi etc.
that have a different farestructure, Route tables for each route and tablesthat include train running frequency details etc.Some temporal tables are maintained in order tocheck the status of the railway ticket (which isknown as checking the Passenger Name Recordor PNR status of the ticket) and reservationavailability information of a particular train.3.2 Design of the Knowledge BaseThe system maintains a knowledge base of thedomain to facilitate question answering.
For asystem operating on a restricted domain this isquite obvious since it will greatly improve thedisambiguation and parsing.The words that occur in the database query forRailway information system includes words de-scribing train name, station name, reservationclass, and date and/or period of journey or key-words that specify the topic of the query.
Hencewe stored a domain dependent ontology in theknowledge base.Knowledge base, which contains tables fortrain name, station name and alias tables for trainname and station name.
We have stored possibleTelugu inflections (?
??
(ke [to]), ?
???
(ku [to]), ??
(loo [in]), ?????????
(tundi [ing]), ??
(vi [have]) etc.for ex: ???????????????
???
(gunturku [to Guntur])), whichcan be used in morphological analysis of inputquery.
We have considered possible postposi-tions like ?????????
(nundi [from]), ?
???????
(nunchi[from] etc.
(For ex: ??????????????
?????????
(newdelhi nundi[from New Delhi])), which can be used to iden-tify the source station in the input query androute words like ??????????
(daggara [near]), ?????
(dwara [through]),  ????????
(gunda [through]), ???????
(vadda [at]), ??????????
(meedugaa [via]) etc.
(Forex: ?????????
??????????
(gaya meedugaa [via Gaya])),which can be used to identify the route station ofthe journey.
We kept a list of keywords in a tablein order to identify the proper query frame.3.3  Query AnalyzerDuring query analysis, Morphological analysis ofthe input query statement is carried out to iden-tify the root words / terms.
Analyzing the wholeinput query, the system identifies several tokenssuch as Train name, Station name, Reservationclass, date and period of the day etc.
and a set ofkeywords.The query analyzer consults the domain-dependent ontology i.e.
knowledge base for rec-ognizing these tokens and keywords.
It may hap-pen that some words/terms may not found in theknowledge base.
Those words do not contain anysemantic information and are simply discarded.EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA0655For example: If our input query is???????????
???????
?
?
????????
???
??????????
???????????????
???
?????????????
(ep-pudu falaknuma express gunturuku veltundi[When the Falaknuma Express goes to Guntur])Here query is parsed based on spaces.
Afterparsing each word, it is searched in the knowl-edge base until the word is found.
After search-ing each word/term in the knowledge base, theirtypes and semantic information are put in a listof tokens.
Each token has three properties: thetoken value, its type and semantic informationthat it contains.
These tokens and keywords areused to decide the proper query frame.For the above example, the tokens identifiedare ???????
?
?
????????
???
??????????
(Falaknuma Express) asTrain name and ??????????????
(Guntur) as Stationname.
Whereas ???????????
(eppudu [when]), ?????????????
(veltundi [goes]) are under keywords list.3.4 Query Frame DecisionDuring the analysis of query, the keywords in theinput query are detected.
In this step, based onthe tokens and keywords, we identify the appro-priate query frame.Restricting the query domain and informa-tion resource, the scope of the user request canbe focused.
That is, there are a finite number ofexpected question topics.
Each expected questiontopic is defined under a single query frame.Some query frame examples for Railway infor-mation system are fare of a journey [Fare], arri-val [Arr_Time] or departure time [Dep_Time] ofa train, trains between important stations[Trains_Imp_Stations], scheduled time[Sched_Time], weekly frequency of a train[Arr_Frequency / Dep_Frequency], Availabilityof reservation class in a particular train [Reserva-tion_Availability] and PNR enquiry[PNR_Enquiry].It is important to select the appropriate queryframe for the user request; because in some casesambiguity will occur i.e.
a single natural lan-guage query statement may belong to one ormore query frames means same keywords areused to identify the query frames.For example keywords like ????????
(vellu [go]),????????
(vachhu [come]), ????????
(cheru [reach]), and??????????????????
(bayuluderu [start]) etc.
are used toidentify the query frames [Arr_Time],[Dep_Time], and [Trains_Imp_Stations].
To re-solve this ambiguity, we consider what/which(question having words ?
(ee [what]), ??
(eeee[what]), ???
(evi [which]) etc.)
type of questionslike ??????????????
?????????
???????
???
??????????????????
?????????
???
(newdelhi nundi howrahku bayaluderu raillu evi[What are the trains starts from New Delhi toHowrah]) are under [Trains_Imp_Stations] queryframe.
Where as, when (questions having words???????????
(eppudu [when]), ???????????????
???
(enniganta-laku [at what time]), ???????????
??
(ennintiki [at whattime]) etc.)
type of questions like ???????????????
???
???????
????
?????????
???
??????????
???????????????????????????
(ennigantalakukolkata rajadhani express bayaluderutundi[When Kolkata Rajdhani Express starts]) are un-der [Dep_Time] query frame.
Similarly, week-day names like ????????????????
(somavaaramu) [Mon-day], ??????????????????????
(mangalavaaramu) [Tuesday]etc.
and keywords used in [Arr_Time]/[Dep_Time] query frame are used to identify the[Arr_Frequency]/ [Dep_Frequency] query frame.In contrast, separate keywords are used toidentify [Arr_Time] and [Dep_Time] queryframes.
But keywords like ???????????
(potundi [go]),????????
(vellu [go]) etc.
are used to identify both[Arr_Time] and [Dep_Time] query frames.
Toresolve this ambiguity, we consider the stationtype, i.e.
whether the station is source or destina-tion.
If the station is source station (station namesucceeded by postpositions like ?????????
(nundi[from]), ?
???????
(nunchi [from])), then we concludethat our query is under [Dep_Time] query frame.Otherwise query will be under [Arr_Time] queryframe.
For example, questions like ???????????
???????
??????????
???
??????????
???????????????
???
?????????????
(eppudu falak-numa express gunturuku veltundi [When the Fa-laknuma Express goes to Guntur]) is under[Arr_Time] query frame.
But, questions like???????????
???????
?
?????????
???
??????????
??????????????
?
????????
?????????????
(eppudu falaknuma express gunturu nundi vel-tundi [When the Falaknuma Express goes fromGuntur]) is under [Dep_Time] query frame.The selection process of query frame has agreat influence on the precision of the system,while there is not much likelihood of errors inother processes, such as getting the informationfrom the dialogue history or generating SQLstatement(s) from the selected query frameand/or retrieving the answer from the databaseand generating natural language answer from theretrieved result.EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA06563.5 Dialogue ManagerThe role of the Dialogue Manager (DM) differsslightly between different dialogue systems.
Butthe primary responsibility of the DM is to controlthe flow of dialogue by deciding how the systemshould respond to a user request and the coordi-nation of the other components in the system.
Ifsome information is missing or a request is am-biguous, clarification questions are specified bythe DM and posed to the user.For example in general, users ask questionsabout Arrival/Departure time without mentioningjourney of train i.e.
Upward/Downward journey,then system asks the user for proper information.Sometimes user may not give correct informa-tion (like missing Train name, Station name orquery does not belong to any of the query framesetc.).
At that time DM generates error messagedescribing that missed information.
In anothercase user asks questions without knowledge.
Inthis case DM generates a cooperative message,which will help the user in further requests.As a basis for the above tasks the DM utilizesthe dialogue history.
Here dialogue history re-cords the focal information, i.e what has beentalked in the past and what is talking at present.It is used for dialogue control and disambigua-tion of context dependent requests.
The DM getsa semantic frame from the other system compo-nents.
This frame is filled by interpreting the re-quest in the context of the ongoing dialogue,domain knowledge, and dialogue history.
TheDM then prompts for missing information orsends a SQL query.
Before the query is sent off,DM checks whether new information is con-tained in the query or the information is contra-dictory to information given before.
If this is thecase then the DM can either keep the originalinformation or replace it with the new one in thedialogue history or engage in a confirmation sub-dialogue.The DM looks at the query after languageprocessing has been completed (but before theformal query is issued), as well as after the resulthas been obtained from the formal query.
Theaccuracy of the system mainly depends on therepresentation of the dialogue history and howthe DM responds to the user?s dialogue.3.6 SQL GenerationOnce the query frame is selected for a ques-tion, the corresponding procedure for the SQLquery generation is called.
For each query framethere is a procedure for SQL statement(s) genera-tion.
In order to generate the SQL query, it needsthe tokens generated by the query analyzer.If the tokens are presented in the currentquery, it uses them.
Otherwise it gets the tokeninformation from the dialogue history.
For ex-ample, in the arrival time queries user has tospecify Train name/no and station/city namewhere he/she needs to go.
If he/she did not men-tion that information, SQL generation proceduregets the information from the dialogue history.Figure 2 depicts the conversion of natural lan-guage query to its SQL query.Figure 2: Interpreting the natural languagequestion to the SQL queryFor the fare related query, SQL generationprocedure would be called depending on the typeof train.
The procedure considers that the userwill provide the train name and reservation class.If the train is of Express type, it considers thatthe user may provide either the source and desti-nation stations of journey or the distance of jour-ney.
If it is of Rajdhani type, it considers that theuser may provide source and destination stationof journey.
Similarly for the other query frames,SQL generation procedure considers that the userprovide the necessary information.???????????

?.EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA06573.7 Answer GenerationOnce the SQL statement for an input querystatement is generated, it is triggered on the da-tabase and the retrieved information is used torepresent the answer.
The retrieved informationis updated in the dialogue history for further ref-erence.Figure 3: Generating answer from the retrievedresult.Each query frame has its corresponding An-swer generator.
We use template based answergeneration method.
Each template consists ofseveral slots.
Those slots are filled by the re-trieved answer and the tokens generated from thequery.
Figure 3 shows the answer generationfrom the SQL query generated from the naturallanguage query shown in Figure 2.
The answerwill be sent to Dialogue Manager, which willfurther send it to the user.4 EvaluationFor evaluating our system we have taken queriesfrom our Telugu-speaking friends.
We have de-scribed the Railway Information system to them.They have also been told about the constraints onthe nature of queries in the systems.
They havealso been shown list of example queries for thesystems.Here we are considering two measures forevaluating our system: Dialogue success rate andPrecision.
The QA system was evaluated by giv-ing 26 sets of dialogue consisting 95 natural lan-guage queries in total.
The two evaluation meas-ures are defined as follows:Dialogue success rate for each set=Number ofAnswers or Responses generated by the system/Number of turns issued by the user.Dialogue success rate = (?
Dialogue success ratefor each set / Number of sets of dialogues)*100.Precision= (Number of correct answers given bythe system/Number of answers given by the sys-tem)*100.The number of turns issued by the user in adialogue is the total of the number of questionsissued to the system and the number of responsesprovided by the user to the system.Each set of dialogue consisted of around 3 to 5natural language queries.
The total dialogue suc-cess rate for the 26 sets was obtained as 21.83.The dialogue success rate for the system is calcu-lated asDialogue success rate= (21.83/26)*100= 83.96%.Out of 95 questions, system generated answersfor 82 questions of which 79 were correct an-swers.
So, the precision of the system is calcu-lated asPrecision= (79/82)*100= 96.34%.This low dialogue success rate is due to thefact that the system coverage of the domain isnot extensive enough, i.e., query frames for somenatural language queries were not correctly iden-tified.
The information given by the user in thequery was sometimes inadequate and the systemwas not able to identify the missing informationbecause of the incorrect choice of the queryframe.
Sometimes the system is unable to obtaintokens correctly from the input query even if ithad identified the right query frame, therebygenerating wrong answers.
Misinterpretation ofdialogue history is also another problem.5 ConclusionIn this dialogue based QA system following thekeyword based approach, each word need not befound in the knowledge base.
Only the wordsthat contain semantic information needs to befound in the knowledge base.By restricting the coverage of questions, oursystem could achieve relatively high dialoguesuccess rate.
However, for a real practical systemthis success rate must be improved.In extension to our work we are developingthe modules for the remaining query frames.
Thesystem needs to be upgraded so that a user canquery for railway information over phone.
Thespeech input can be converted to textual query.This textual query can be input of our system andthe textual out can be converted to speech againto answer the user.ReferencesAndroutsopoulos I, Ritchie G. D, and Thanisch P.1995.
