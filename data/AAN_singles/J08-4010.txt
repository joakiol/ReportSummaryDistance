by Gu?ls?en Eryig?it, JoakimNivre, and Kemal Oflazer (September 2008, Vol.
34, No.
3: 357?389), some abbreviationswere misinterpreted during the copyediting process.The third sentence of Section 5.2 should be as follows: ?We use an unlexicalizedfeature model where the parser uses only the minor part-of-speech category (as POS)and dependency type of tokens (as DEP) and compare the results with the probabilisticparser.
?The first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 5.2.1 should start as follows:?We take the minor part-of-speech category.

?The ?POS?
abbreviation used on page 20 should be read as ?minor part-of-speech,?
and the ?POS?
abbreviations on pages 21, 26, 27, and 28 should be read as?part-of-speech.??
