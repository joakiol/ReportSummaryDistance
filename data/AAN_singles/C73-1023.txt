, -THOMAS M. PAIKEDAYTHE AMERICAN HERITAGE INTERMEDIATE COP.PUSSample studies of the five-million-word American Heritage In-termediate Corpus, the largest yet for English, show the inadequaciesof computerized word counts for lexicographical purposes.
Out ofabout 87,000 word types listed in the American Heritage Word Fre-quency Book (by JOHN B. C~RorI.
et ali, Houghton Mifflin-AmericanHeritage, New York, 1971), only about 40 % seem distinctive lexicalitems.
On the other hand, 22 % of the vocabulary entries required bythe 50,000-entry dictionary for which the Corpus was prepared idnot occur even once among the five million word tokens.We first examined three randomly selected portions of the listingin the American Heritage Word Frequency Book (AHWFB).side by sidewith the corresponding entry lists of the American Heritage School Dic-tionary (AHSD), the Thorndike-Barnhart Intermediate Dictionary (TBID),the Merriam-Webster New Students Dictionary (WNSD), the HoltIntermediate Dictionary (HID), and the Random House School Dictionary(RHSD).
Each of the three portions checked in AHWFB was basedon a consolidated list of 100 entry words (300 in all), made up of thevocabulary entries in the dictionaries: (1) AFTER.
to AHAB, (2)CABBAGE to CALEB, and (3) LAKE to LANOLIN.Our aim was to fred out how useful the Corpus was in assessing thevocabulary of Grades 3-9 and in adding new words to the lexicon ofthat level as presented in the dictionaries.Here are some of our findings:There are approximately 110 word types in each sample of the mainAHWFB listings (once-occurring entries listed at bottom of pageswere omitted) corresponding to each 100-entry-word portion fromthe dictionaries.Of the 110 word types, 36 % are lexically undistinctive items inad-missible as vocabulary entries in dictionaries.
Such are: (a) hyphenatedloose compounds, e.g.
After-Shaving, agreedon, and air-breathing; (b)solid forms of hyphenated compounds; (c) spellings with tmdistinctiveinitial capital instead of lower-case letter, such as After, Against, Age,282 THOMAS M. PAIKEDAYand Ahead; (d) regular inflected forms of nouns, adjectives, verbs, andadverbs; (c) unusual word types, numbers, and other such "graphictypes"Over 13 ?/o are lexical and non-lexical items inadmissible in anyof the five dictionaries, including AHSD.

* N.B.
There seems no reason why  high-frequency items like Cadillac (72) andFord (109) should not be entered in dictionaries, especially when they occur in senten-ces o f  this sort: ~ A Cadillac crashed into a Ford ~, in which Cadillac and Ford are usedin a generic manner, not as proper names.THE AMERICAN HERITAGE INTERMEDIATE CORPUS 283In other words, only 46 % of the word types sampled from AHWFBwere found to have been useful for AHSD, and these were already in theother dictionaries.On the other hand, out of the 300 entry words in the three conso-lidated lists based on dictionary entries, only 235 (about 78 %) werein AHWFB.
The other 65 lexical items (22 ?//o) which the dictionariescollectively had, but did not occur even once in the Intermediate Cot-pUS, are:afterbirth cabby Lakeraftercare cabdriver lainafterdeck cabriolet lamaseryafterglow cacique lambdaaftertaste cacomistle lambentageratum cacophonous lambkinagglomerate caddish lambskinagglomeration Caddo lamentablyagglutinate Caddoan lampoonagglutination Cadette lampooneryagglutinin cadge Lanaiaggrandize Caduceus Lancashireaglitter Caesarea lanceletagnosticism Caesarean Lancelotagog caesium lanceragora caesura lancewoodAgra caftan landauagt.

PAIKEDAYCACOMISTLE: A racoonlike animal of southwestern NorthAmerica, having a long black-banded tail;LAKER-S: The national Basketball Association team from LosAngeles.Another study of the American Heritage Intermediate Corpus thatwe did was an analysis of its lexical components.We listed all the word types (including those of single occurrence)in the three portions used in our study of the usefulness of the corpusfor lexicographical purposes, viz.
(1) AFTER.
to AHAB, (2) CABBAGEto CALEB, and (3) LAKE to LANOLIN.
Then we grouped themunder the following headings:a) Lexical items: Under this head we included all word typeshaving lexical meaning, including also names of persons and placesapplicable to more than one individual.
Thus Caesar was included butnot Agnew.
Spelling variants uch as Caddy/caddie/Caddie were countedas one, but irregular inflectional forms were counted separately.
Ca-dillac was included for obvious reasons.b) Grammatical items: In this we counted all word types based onhxical items, such as spelling variants, regular inflectional forms, com-pounds and nonce forms having no more meaning than those of theirparts, such as landloving, land-management, a d land-reform, etc.c) Non-lexical items: In this we included unusual word typesto which we could not assign a meaning, and unique persons and places.A word type such as ah-h-h was counted as a lexical item, but lan'and Aggie were considered non-lexical.The following chart indicates the components of the lexicon, ac-cording to our sample study, of the Grade 3-9 vocabulary presentedin the AHI Corpus.
It must be mentioned here that non-lexical per-0 o?

Dr. Carroll, the senior authorof the America Heritage Word Frequency Book, has said: "My  mathe-matical analysis of the problem of sampling indicates that a truly erior-mous corpus, say on the order of 500 million words, would be requiredif the resulting list were to be expected to include all or nearly all itemsrequired for a dictionary of respectable size.
