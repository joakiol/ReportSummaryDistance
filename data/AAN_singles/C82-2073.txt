EXPLICIT SE~ENCES ARD SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITYRe ZuberC~,  Pazd.s, PrancePreneh sentence (1) can be t rans la ted  in to  Engl ishe i ther  by (2) or (3) :( I ) Leslie est 6tudlante(2) Leslie Is a student(3) Leslie Is a woman and Leslle Is a studentIt is clear however that nelther (2) nor (3) can be consider-ed as an "exact" translation of (1).
Sentence (2) does notcarry the information that Leslie Is a woman and sentence (3)does not carry thls-information in the same way as (1 ) i  thefact ~hat Leslie is a woman Is presupposed by (1) whereas iti s  asser ted  by (3 ) .
In  other  words sentence  (3) i s  more exp lg -clt than sentence (1).
Following Keenan (1973) we will saythat a sentence S is more explicit than a sentence T I f f  Sand T have the same consequences but some, presupposition o fTIs an assertion of S.Not only translations can be more explicit.
Per instan-ce (5) is more explicit that (4) since (4) presupposes (6)wherens (5) esserts (6):(4) Blll knows that Sue has phoned(5) Sue has phoned and Bill knows whether Sue has phoned ornot(6) Sue has phonedRouKhly, de f in ing  sentences  are, more exp l i c i t  than "de f ined"sentenoese The quest lon  ld~ch we w i l l  t ry  to answer inth i s  paper i s  the fo l low~ one: are  more exp l i c i t  sentences- 299 -th i s  paper i s  the fo l low ing  one: are  more exp l i c i t  sentencessyntact i ca l l y  more complex ones (not i ce  that  (3) i s  syntact -i ca l l y  more eo~aplex than (I) as we l l  as (53 i s  more complexthan (4)).We will show that at least for some simple languagesthis ie indeed the case: more explicit sentences are syntact-ically more complex.
We will consider essentially proposit-ional categorial leaguage8, i.e.
languages in which we haveon ly  the category  o f  sentences  end the category  of  sentent ia loperators .
