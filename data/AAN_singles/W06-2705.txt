Corpus design, anno-tation and alignment are described in de-tail.
In order to guarantee the searchabil-ity and exchangeability of the corpus,XML stand-off mark-up is used as repre-sentation format for the multi-layer anno-tation.
On this basis it is shown how thecorpus can be queried using XQuery.Furthermore, the generalisation of resultsin terms of linguistic and translational re-search questions is briefly discussed.1 IntroductionIn translation studies the question of how trans-lated texts differ systematically from originaltexts has been an issue for quite some time with asurge of research in the last ten or so years.
Ex-ample-based contrastive analyses of small num-bers of source texts and their translations hadpreviously described characteristic features ofthe translated texts, without the availability ofmore large-scale empirical testing.
Blum-Kulka(1986), for instance, formulates the hypothesisthat explicitation is a characteristic phenomenonof translated versus original texts on the basis oflinguistic evidence from individual sample textsshowing that translators explicitate optional co-hesive markers in the target text not realised inthe source text.
In general, explicitation coversall features that make implicit information in thesource text clearer and thus explicit in the trans-lation (cf.
Steiner 2005).Building on example-based work like Blum-Kulka?s, Baker put forward the notion of trans-lation universals (cf.
Baker 1996) which can beanalysed in corpora of translated texts regardlessof the source language in comparison to originaltexts in the target language.
Olohan and Baker(2000) therefore analyse explicitation in Englishtranslations concentrating on the frequency of theoptional that versus zero-connector in combina-tion with the two verbs say and tell.
While beingextensive enough for statistical interpretation,corpus-driven research like Olohan and Baker'sis limited in its validity to the selected strings.More generally speaking, there is a gap be-tween the abstract research object and the low le-vel features used as indicators.
This gap can bereduced by operationalising notions like explicit-tation into syntactic and semantic categories,which can be annotated and aligned in a corpus.Intelligent queries then produce linguistic evi-dence with more explanatory power than low le-vel data obtained from raw corpora.
The resultsare not restricted to the queried strings but extendto more complex units sharing the syntactic and/or semantic properties obtained by querying theannotation.This methodology serves as a basis for theCroCo project, in which the assumed translationproperty of explicitation is investigated for thelanguage pair English ?
German.
The empiricalevidence for the investigation consists in a cor-pus of English originals, their German transla-tions as well as German originals and their Eng-lish translations.
Both translation directions arerepresented in eight registers.
Biber?s calcula-tions, i.e.
10 texts per register with a length of atleast 1,000 words, serve as an orientation for thesize of the sub-corpora (cf.
Biber 1993).
Alto-35gether the CroCo Corpus comprises one millionwords.
Additionally, reference corpora are in-cluded for German and English.
The referencecorpora are register-neutral including 2,000 wordsamples from 17 registers (see Neumann & Han-sen-Schirra 2005 for more details on the CroCocorpus design).The CroCo Corpus is tokenised and annotatedfor part-of-speech, morphology, phrasal catego-ries and grammatical functions.
Furthermore, thefollowing (annotation) units are aligned: words,grammatical functions, clauses and sentences.The annotation and alignment steps are describedin section 2.Each annotation and alignment layer is storedseparately in a multi-layer stand-off XML repre-sentation format.
In order to empirically investi-gate the parallel corpus (e.g.
to find evidence forexplicitation in translations), XQuery is used forposing linguistic queries.
The query process it-self works on each layer separately, but can alsobe applied across different annotation and align-ment layers.
It is described in more detail in sec-tion 3.
This way, parallel text segments and/orparallel annotation units can be extracted andcompared for translations and originals in Ger-man and English.2 CroCo XMLThe annotation in CroCo extends to differentlevels in order to cover possible linguistic evi-dence on each level.
Thus, each kind of annota-tion (part-of-speech, morphology, phrase struc-ture, grammatical functions) is realised in a sepa-rate layer.
An additional layer is included whichcontains comprehensive metainformation in se-parate header files for each text in the corpus.The file containing the indexed tokens (see sec-tion 2.1) includes an xlink attribute referring tothis header file as depicted in Figure 2.1.
Themetadata are based on the TEI guidelines1 andinclude register information.
The complex multi-lingual structure of the corpus in combinationwith the multi-layer annotation requires indexingthe corpus.
The indexing is carried out on the ba-sis of the tokenised corpus.
Index and annotationlayers are kept separate using XML stand-offmark-up.
The mark-up builds on XCES2.
Differ-ent formats of the multiple annotation and align-ment outputs are converted with Perl scripts.Each annotation and alignment unit is indexed.1 http://www.tei-c.org2 http://www.xml-ces.orgThe respective annotations and alignments arelinked to the indexed units via XPointers.The following sections describe the differentannotation layers and are exemplified for theGerman original sentence in (1) and its Englishtranslation in (2)3.
(1) Ich spielte viele M?glichkeitendurch, stellte mir den T?ter inverschiedenen Posen vor, ich unddie Pistole, ich und die Giftfla-sche, ich und der Kn?ppel, ich unddas Messer.
(2) I ran through numerous possibi-lities, pictured the perpetrator invarious poses, me with the gun, mewith the bottle of poison, me withthe bludgeon, me with the knife.2.1 Tokenisation and indexingThe first layer to be presented here is the tokeni-sation layer.
Tokenisation is performed in CroCofor both German and English by TnT (Brants2000), a statistical part-of-speech tagger.
Asshown in Figure 2.1 each token annotated withthe attribute strg has also an id attribute, whichindicates the position of the word in the text.This id represents the anchor for all XPointerspointing to the tokenisation file by an id startingwith a ?t?.
The file is identified by the name at-tribute.
The xml:lang attribute indicates the lan-guage of the file, docType provides informationon whether the present file is an original or atranslation.<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GO.tok.xml" xml:lang="de"docType="ori"><header xlink:href="GO.header.xml"/><tokens><token id="t64" strg="Ich"/><token id="t65" strg="spielte"/><token id="t66" strg="viele"/><token id="t67"strg="M?glichkeiten"/><token id="t68" strg="durch"/><token id="t69" strg=","/></tokens></document>Figure 2.1.
Tokenisation and indexingSimilar index files necessary for the alignment ofthe respective levels are created for the unitschunk, clause and sentence.
These units stand in3 All examples are taken from the CroCo Corpus.36a hierarchical relation with sentences consistingof clauses, clauses consisting of chunks etc.2.2 Part-of-speech taggingThe second layer annotated for both languages isthe part-of-speech layer, which is provided againby TnT4.
The token annotation of the part-of-speech layer starts with the xml:base attribute,which indicates the index file it refers to.
Thepart-of-speech information for each token is an-notated in the pos attribute, as shown in Figure2.2.
The attribute strg in the token index file andpos in the tag annotation are linked by an xlinkattribute pointing to the id attribute in the indexfile.
For example, the German token pointing to"t65" in the token index file whose strg value isstellte is a finite verb (with the PoS tag vvfin).<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GO.tag.xml"><tokens xml:base="GO.tok.xml"><token pos="pper" xlink:href="#t64"/><token pos="vvfin"xlink:href="#t65"/><token pos="pidat"xlink:href="#t66"/><token pos="nn" xlink:href="#t67"/><token pos="ptkvz"xlink:href="#68"/><token pos="yc" xlink:href="#t69"/></tokens></document>Figure 2.2.
PoS tagging2.3 Morphological annotationMorphological information is particularly rele-vant for German due to the fact that this lan-guage carries much syntactic information withinmorphemes rather than in separate functionwords like English.
Morphology is annotated inCroCo with MPro, a rule-based morphology tool(Maas 1998).
This tool works on both languages.As shown in Figure 2.3 each token has morpho-logical attributes such as person, case, gender,number and lemma.
As before, the xlink attrib-ute refers back to the index file, thus providingthe connection between the morphological attri-butes and the strg information in the index file.For the morphological annotation of the Ger-man token "t65" in Figure 2.3 the strg value isdetermined by following the XPointer "t65" tothe token index file, i.e.
spielte.
The pos value isretrieved by searching in the tag annotation for4 For German we use the STTS tag set (Schiller et al 1999),and for English the Susanne tag set (Sampson 1995).the file with the same xml:base value.
Thematching tag, in this case vvfin, carries the sameXPointer ?t65?.<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GO.morph.xml"><tokens xml:base="GO.tok.xml"><token strg="Ich" per="1" case="nom"nb="sg" gender="f;m" lemma="ich"lb="ich" xlink:href="#t64"/><token strg="spielte" vtype="fiv"tns="past" per="3" nb="sg"lemma="spielen" lb="spielen" comp="spielen" xlink:href="#t65"/><token strg="viele" case="nom;acc"nb="plu" gender="f" lemma="viel"lb="viel" comp="viel" deg="base"xlink:href="#t66"/><token strg="M?glichkeiten" case="nom;acc" nb="plu" gender="f" lemma="m?glichkeit" lb="m?glich" comp="m?glichkeit" xlink:href="#t67"/><token strg="durch" lemma="durch"lb="durch" pref="vzs"xlink:href="#t68"/><token strg="," lemma="," lb=","xlink:href="#t69"/></tokens></document>Figure 2.3.
Morphological annotation2.4 Phrase chunking and annotation ofgrammatical functionsMoving up from the token unit to the chunk unit,first we have to index these units again before wecan annotate them.
The chunk index file assignsan id attribute to each chunk within the file.
Theproblem of discontinuous phrase chunks issolved by listing child tags referring to the indi-vidual tokens which make up the chunk via xlinkattributes.
Figure 2.4 shows that the VP ?ch14?in the German phrase annotation consists of?t70?
(stellte) and ?t77?
(vor).<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"name="GO.chunk.xml"><chunks xml:base="GO.tok.xml"><chunk id="ch13"><tok xlink:href="#t66"/><tok xlink:href="#t67"/></chunk><chunk id="ch14"><tok xlink:href="#t70"/></chunk><chunk id="ch15"><tok xlink:href="#t71"/></chunk><chunk id="ch16"><tok xlink:href="#t72"/><tok xlink:href="#t73"/></chunk>37<chunk id="ch17"><tok xlink:href="#t74"/><chunk id="ch18"><tok xlink:href="#t75"/><tok xlink:href="#t76"/></chunk></chunk><chunk id="ch19"><tok xlink:href="#t77"/></chunk></chunks></document>Figure 2.4.
Chunk indexingThe phrase structure annotation (see Figure 2.5)assigns the ps attribute to each phrase chunkidentified by MPro.
XPointers link the phrasestructure annotation to the chunk index file.
Itshould be noted that in CroCo the phrase struc-ture analysis is limited to higher chunk nodes, asour focus within this layer is more on completephrase chunks and their grammatical functions.<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GO.ps.xml"><chunks xml:base="GO.chunk.xml"><chunk ps="NP" xlink:href="#ch13"/><chunk ps="VPFIN"xlink:href="#ch14"/><chunk ps="NP" xlink:href="#ch15"/><chunk ps="NP" xlink:href="#ch16"/><chunk ps="PP" xlink:href="#ch17"/><chunk ps="NP" xlink:href="#ch18"/><chunk ps="VPPRED"xlink:href="#ch19"/></chunks></document>Figure 2.5.
Phrase structure annotationThe annotation of grammatical functions is againkept in a separate file (see Figure 2.6).
Only thehighest phrase nodes are annotated for theirgrammatical function with the attribute gf.
TheXPointer links the annotation of each function tothe chunk id in the chunk index file.
From thisfile in turn the string can be retrieved in the tokenannotation.
For example, the English chunk?ch13?
carries the grammatical function of directobject (DOBJ).
It is identified as an NP in thephrase structure annotation by comparing thexml:base attribute value of the two files and theXPointers.<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GO.gf.xml"><chunks xml:base="GO.chunk.xml"><chunk gf="DOBJ" xlink:href="#ch13"/><chunk gf="FIN" link:href="#ch14"/><chunk gf="IOBJ" xlink:href="#ch15"/><chunk gf="DOBJ" xlink:href="#ch16"/><chunk gf="ADV" xlink:href="#ch17"/><chunk gf="PRED" xlink:href="#ch19"/></chunks></document>Figure 2.6.
Annotation of grammatical functions2.5 AlignmentIn the examples shown so far, the different anno-tation layers linked to each other all belonged tothe same language.
By aligning words, gram-matical functions, clauses and sentences, theconnection between original and translated text ismade visible.
The use of this multi-layer align-ment will become clearer from the discussion ofa sample query in section 3.For the purpose of the CroCo project wordalignment is realised with GIZA++ (Och & Ney2003), a statistical alignment tool.
Chunks andclauses are aligned manually with the help ofMMAX II (M?ller & Strube 2003), a tool allow-ing assignment of own categories and linkingunits.
Finally, sentences are aligned using Win-Align, an alignment tool within the Translator?sWorkbench by Trados (Heyn 1996).The alignment procedure produces four newlayers.
It follows the XCES standard.
Figure 2.7shows the chunk alignment of (1) and (2).
In thislayer, we align on the basis of grammatical func-tions instead of phrases since this annotation in-cludes the information of the phrase chunking aswell as on the semantic relations of the chunks.The grammatical functions are mapped onto eachother cross-linguistically and then aligned ac-cording to our annotation and alignment scheme.The trans.loc attribute locates the chunk indexfile for the aligned texts in turn.
Furthermore, therespective language as well as the n attribute or-ganising the order of the aligned texts are given.We thus have an alignment tag for each languagein each chunk pointing to the chunk index file.As can be seen from Figure 2.7, chunks which donot have a matching equivalent receive the value?#undefined?, a phenomenon that will be of in-terest in the linguistic interpretation on the basisof querying the corpus.<documentxmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="gfAlign.xml"><translations xml:base="/CORPUS/"><translation trans.loc="GO.chunk.xml"xml:lang="de" n="1"/><translationtrans.loc="ETrans.chunk.xml"xml:lang="en" n="2"/>38</translations><chunks><chunk><align xlink:href="#ch14"/><align xlink:href="#ch16"/></chunk><chunk><align xlink:href="#ch15"/><align xlink:href="#undefined"/></chunk><chunk><align xlink:href="#ch16"/><align xlink:href="#ch17"/></chunk><chunk><align xlink:href="#ch17"/><align xlink:href="#ch18"/></chunk><chunk><align xlink:href="#ch19"/><align xlink:href="#undefined"/></chunk></chunks></document>Figure 2.7.
Chunk alignment3 Querying the CroCo CorpusThe comprehensive annotation including thealignment described in section 2 is the basis forthe interpretation to be presented in what fol-lows.
We concentrate on two types of queriesinto the different alignment layers that are as-sumed relevant in connection with our researchquestion.3.1 Crossing lines and empty linksFrom the linguistic point of view we are inter-ested in those units in the target text which donot have matches in the source text and viceversa, i.e.
empty links, or whose alignmentcrosses the alignment of a higher level, i.e.crossing lines.
We analyse for instance stretchesof text contained in one sentence in the sourcetext but spread over two sentences in the targettext, as this probably has implications for theoverall information contained in the target text.We would thus pose a query retrieving all in-stances where the alignment of the lower level isnot parallel to the higher level alignment butpoints into another higher level unit.
In the ex-ample below the German source sequence (3) aswell as the English target sequence (4) both con-sist of three sentences.
These sentences are eachaligned as illustrated by dashed boxes in Figure3.1.
(3) Aus dem Augenwinkel sah ich,wie eine Schwester dem Bettnachbarndas Nachthemd wechselte.
Sie riebden R?cken mit Franzbranntwein einund massierte den etwas j?ngerenMann, dessen Adern am ganzen K?rperbl?ulich hervortraten.
Ihre H?ndelie?en ihn leise wimmern.
(4) Out of the corner of my eye Iwatched a nurse change hisneighbor?s nightshirt and rub hisback with alcoholic liniment.
Shemassaged the slightly younger man,whose veins stood out blue all overhis body.
He whimpered softly underher hands.In German the first two sentences are subdividedinto two clauses each.
The English target sen-tences are co-extensive with the clauses con-tained in each sentence.
This means that twoEnglish clauses have to accommodate four Ger-man clauses.
Figure 3.1 shows that the Germanclause 3 (Sie rieb den R?cken mit Franzbrannt-wein ein) in sentence 2 is part of the bare infini-tive complementation (?and rub his back withalcoholic liniment) in the English sentence 1.The alignment of this clause points out of thealigned first sentence, thus constituting crossinglines.Sentence 3Sentence 2Sentence 1Clause 1 Clause 2 Clause 3 Clause 4 Clause 5Sentence 3Sentence 2Sentence 1Clause 1 Clause 2 Clause 3GermansourceEnglishtargetFigure 3.1.
Sentence and clause alignmentThe third sentence also contains a crossing line,in this case on the levels of chunk and wordalignment: The words Ihre H?nde in the Germansubject chunk are aligned with the words herhands in the English adverbial chunk.
However,this sentence is particularly interesting in view ofempty links.
The query asks for units not match-ing any unit in the parallel text, i.e.
for xlink at-tributes whose values are ?#undefined?
(cf.
sec-tion 2.5).
In Figure 3.2, the empty links aremarked by a black dot.DOBJ ADVFINSUBJword 1 word 2 word 3 word 4 word 5GermansourceEnglishtargetPREDword 6SUBJword 1FINword 2ADVword 3ADVword 4 word 5 word 6Figure 3.2.
Chunk and word alignment39Our linguistic interpretation is based on a func-tional view of language.
Hence, the finite lie?en(word 3) in the German sentence is interpreted asa semi-auxiliary and thus as the finite part of theverbal group.
Therefore, wimmern (word 6) re-ceives the label PRED, i.e.
the non-finite part ofthe verb phrase, in the functional analysis.
ThisGerman word is linked to word 2 (whimpered) inthe target sentence, which is assigned FIN, i.e.the finite verb in the layer of grammatical func-tions.
As FIN exists both in the source and in thetarget sentences, this chunk is aligned.
The Ger-man functional unit PRED does not have anequivalent in the target text and gets an emptylink.
Consequently, word 3 in the source sen-tence (lie?en) receives an empty link as well.This mismatch will be interpreted in view of ourtranslation-oriented research.
In the followingsubsection we will see how these two phenom-ena can be retrieved automatically.3.2 Corpus exploitation using XQuerySince the multi-dimensional annotation andalignment is realised in XML, the queries areposed using XQuery5.
This query language isparticularly suited to retrieve information fromdifferent sources like for instance individual an-notation and alignment files.
The use for multi-layer annotation is shown in (Teich et al 2001).The query for determining an empty link atword level can be formulated as follows: find allwords which do not have an aligned correspon-dent, i.e.
which carry the xlink attribute value?#undefined?.
The same query can be applied onthe chunk level, the query returning the gram-matical functions that do not have an equivalentin the other language.
(5)Ihre H?nde lie?en ihn leise wim-mern.
(6) He whimpered softly under herhands.Applied to the sentences in (5) and (6) theXQuery in Figure 3.3 returns all German andEnglish words, which receive an empty link dueto a missing equivalent in alignment (lie?en andunder).
This query can be used analogously in allother alignment layers.
It implies the call of aself-defined XQuery function (see Figure 3.4),which looks in the correspondent index file forwords not aligned.5 http://www.w3.org/TR/xquerylet $doc := .for $k in $doc//tokens/tokenreturnif ($k/align[1][@xlink:href="#un-defined"] and $k/align[2][@xlink:href!="#undefined"])then local:getString($k/align[1]/@xlink:href,$k/align[2]/@xlink:href,$doc//translations/translation[@n='2']/@trans.loc)else if ($k/align[1][@xlink:href!="#undefined"] and $k/align[2][@xlink:href="#undefined"])then local:getString($k/align[1]/@xlink:href,$k/align[2]/@xlink:href,$doc//translations/translation[@n='1']/@trans.loc)else ()Figure 3.3.
XQuery for empty linksdeclare function local:getString($firstToken as xs:string,$secondTo-ken as xs:string,$fileName asxs:string) as element(){let $res:=(if(($firstToken eq"#undefined") and ($lang eq doc($fileName)//document/@xml:lang))then doc($fileName)//tokens/token[@ideq substring-after($secondToken,"#")]else if (($secondToken eq "#unde-fined") and ($lang eq doc($fileName)//document/@xml:lang))then doc($fileName)//tokens/token[@ideq substring-after($firstToken,"#")]else ())return<token>{$res/@strg}</token>};Figure 3.4.
XQuery function for missing align-mentQuerying crossing lines in the German sourcesentence in (5) and the English target sentence in(6) is based on the annotation at word level aswell as on the annotation at the chunk level.
Asmentioned in section 3.1, crossing lines are iden-tified in (5) and (6) if the words contained in thechunks aligned on the grammatical function layerare not aligned on the word level.
This meansthat the German subject is aligned with the Eng-lish subject, but the words within the subjectchunk are aligned with words in other grammati-cal functions instead.In a first step, the query for determining acrossing line requires information about allaligned German chunks with a xlink attributewhose value is not ?#undefined?
and all alignedGerman words with a xlink attribute whosevalue is not ?#undefined?.
Then all Germanwords that are not aligned on the word level butare aligned as part of chunks on the chunk level40are filtered out.
Figure 3.6 reflects the respectiveXQuery.let $doc := .for $k in $doc//chunks/chunklet $ch1:=(if($k/align[1][@xlink:href!="#undefined"] and $k/align[2][@xlink:href!="#undefined"])then doc($doc//translations/trans-lation[@n='1']/@trans.loc)//chunks/chunk[@id eq substring-after($k/align[1]/@xlink:href,"#")]else ())let $ch2:=(if($k/align[1][@xlink:href!="#undefined"] and $k/align[2][@xlink:href!="#undefined"])then (doc($doc//translations/transla-tion[@n='2']/@trans.loc)//chunks/chunk[@id eq substring-after($k/align[2]/@xlink:href,"#")])else ())for $i in doc("g2e.tokenAlign.xml")//tokens/tokenlet $tok1:=(if($i/align[1][@xlink:href!="#undefined"] and $i/align[2][@xlink:href!="#undefined"])then(doc(doc("g2e.tokenAlign.xml")//translations/translation[@n='1']/@trans.loc)//tokens/token[@id eqsubstring-after($i/align[1]/@xlink:href,"#")])else ())let $tok2:=(if($i/align[1][@xlink:href!="#undefined"] and $i/align[2][@xlink:href!="#undefined"])then(doc(doc("g2e.tokenAlign.xml")//translations/translation[@n='2']/@trans.loc)//tokens/token[@id eqsubstring-after($i/align[2]/@xlink:href,"#")])else ())where(local:containsToken($ch1/tok[position()=1],$ch1/tok[last()],$tok1/@id) and not(local:containsToken($ch2/tok[position()=1],$ch2/tok[last()],$tok2/@id)))return $tok1Figure 3.6.
XQuery for crossing linesFirst, the aligned chunks ($ch1 and $ch2) aresaved into variables.
These values are importantin order to detect the span for each of the chunks($ch1/tok[position()=1], $ch1/tok[last()] and$ch2/tok[position()=1], $ch2/tok[last()]), and toidentify the words making up the source chunksas well as their German or English equivalents.In the second step all words that do not haveempty links are saved ($tok1 and $tok2).
Thelast step filters the crossing lines, i.e.
word align-ments pointing out of the chunk alignment.
Forthis purpose, we define a new function (local:-containsToken) which tests whether a word be-longs to a chunk or not.
By applying local:con-tainsToken for the German original and not-(local:containsToken) for the English transla-tion, all words in the German chunks whosealigned English equivalent words do not belongto the aligned English chunks are retrieved.
Theexample query returns the German words IhreH?nde that are part of the German subject chunkand which are aligned with the English wordsher hands that again are part of the second ad-verbial chunk.4 Summary and conclusionsIn a broader view, it can be observed that there isan increasing need in richly annotated corporaacross all branches of linguistics.
The same holdsfor linguistically interpreted parallel corpora intranslation studies.
Usually, though, the problemwith large-scale corpora is that they do not re-flect the complexity of linguistic knowledge weare used to dealing with in linguistic theory.Simple research questions can of course be an-swered on the basis of raw corpora or with thehelp of an automatic part-of-speech tagging.Most linguistics and translation scholars are,however, interested in more complex questionslike the interaction of syntax and semanticsacross languages.The research described here shows the use ofcomprehensive multi-layer annotation acrosslanguages.
By relating a highly abstract researchquestion to multiple layers of lexical and gram-matical realisations, characteristic patterns ofgroups of texts, e.g.
explicitation in translationsand originals in the case of the CroCo project,can be identified on the basis of statistically rele-vant linguistic evidence.If we want to enrich corpora with multiplekinds of linguistic information, we need a lin-guistically motivated model of the linguisticunits and relations we would like to extract anddraw conclusions based on an annotated andaligned corpus.
So the first step for the compila-tion of a parallel translation corpus is to providea classification of linguistic units and relationsand their mappings across source and target lan-guages.
The classification of English and Ger-man linguistic units and relations chosen for theCroCo project (i.e.
for the investigation of ex-plicitation in translations and originals) is re-flected in the CroCo annotation and alignmentschemes and thus in the CroCo Corpus annota-tion and alignment.From a technical point of view, the representa-tion of a multilingual resource comprehensively41annotated and aligned is to be realised in such away that?
multiple linguistic perspectives on the corpusare possible since different annotations andalignments can be investigated independ-ently or in combination,?
the corpus format guarantees best possibleaccessibility and exchangeability, and?
the exploitation of the corpus is possible us-ing easily available tools for search andanalysis.We coped with this challenge by introducing amulti-layer stand-off corpus representation for-mat in XML (see section 2), which takes into ac-count not only the different annotation layersneeded from a linguistic point of view, but alsomultiple alignment layers necessary to investi-gate different translation relations.We also showed how the CroCo resource canbe applied to complex research questions in lin-guistics and translation studies using XQuery toretrieve multi-dimensional linguistic information(see section 3).
Based on the stand-off storage ofannotation and alignment layers combined withthe possibility to exploit the required layersthrough intelligent queries, parallel text segmentsand/or parallel annotation units can be extractedand compared across languages.In order to make the CroCo resource availableto researchers not familiar with the complexitiesof XML mark-up and the XQuery language, agraphical user interface will be implemented inJava which allows formulating queries withoutknowledge of the XQuery syntax.AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank the reviewers fortheir excellent comments and helpful feedbackon previous versions of this paper.The research described here is sponsored bythe German Research Foundation as project no.STE 840/5-1.ReferencesMona Baker.
