Demographic Prediction via the Videos They Talk aboutYuan Wang, Yang Xiao, Chao Ma, and Zhen XiaoDepartment of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China{wangyuan, xiaoyang, machao, xiaozhen}@net.pku.edu.cnAbstractIn this paper, we improve microblog users?demographic prediction by fully utilizing theirvideo related behaviors.
First, we collect thedescribing words of currently popular videos,including video names, actor names and videokeywords, from video websites.
Secondly,we search these describing words in users?microblogs, and build the direct relationshipsbetween users and the appeared words.
Afterthat, to make the sparse relationship denser,we propose a Bayesian method to calculatethe probability of connections between usersand other video describing words.
Last-ly, we build two models to predict users?demographics with the obtained direct andindirect relationships.
Based on a large real-world dataset, experiment results show thatour method can significantly improve thesewords?
demographic predictive ability.1 IntroductionRecent studies have indicated that users?
demo-graphics can be predicted from their linguisticcharacteristics.
A typical practice is cutting the textinto a bag of words and training a linear classifier.Although this practice can achieve an acceptableresult in simple tasks such as predicting gender andage, it loses some important information about thetext structure and does not fully use the relationshipbetween words.Nowadays, people spend a lot of time on videosand social media which provide them with accessto post views and comments.
Weibo is one of thebiggest microblogging platforms in China.
Morethan one third of the ?Weibo Trends?1 are aboutvideos.
Generally, people with different demograph-ic attributes usually have different tastes for videos(Abisheva et al, 2014).
For example, in Chinapeople who watch English drama tend to be well-educated.
Here is a question: if the video relatedinformation in users?
weibo messages can be fullyused, will the users?
demographic prediction beimproved?One challenge is that many users do not directlymention the video names in their weibo messages.Instead, they make comments on the actors orthe plots.
If a person likes ?Big Bang Theory?,he may post ?Will the Big Bang Theory last intothe next century??
where the sitcom?s name ismentioned directly, or ?Sheldon is so cool, I lovehim!?
which talks about an actor of the sitcom.Both posts indicate the user is interested in ?BigBang Theory?.
When involving the demographicprediction, however, the traditional ?bag of wordsbased?
model cannot extract the above informationeffectively.
Some previous works use topic modelssuch as LIWC (Pennebaker et al, 2001) or LDA(Blei et al, 2003) to detect the relations amongusers?
words.
Usually, they suffer from the shortlength of weibo messages and the number of topics.In addition, the lifespan of most popular videoprograms is not very long, which renders traditionaltopic models inefficient.Fortunately, there exist some third-party videowebsites, such as youtube.com and youku.com, fromwhich we can get the most popular videos.
For eachvideo, there is usually a homepage with a actor list1http://d.weibo.com/1008031359and also a comments section, and we can calculatethe video?s Top TF-IDF words (keywords) based onthese comments.
Here we define the video name,actor name and keyword to be three different kindsof ?video describing words?.
The relationshipsamong these words can be used to better understandweibo users?
video related behaviors.
This approachcan be applied to other kinds of words, such asdescribing words on books and music.
This paperfocuses on the video as an example.After obtaining the video describing words, webuild three matrices to represent the direct andindirect relationships between weibo users and thesewords.
They are User-Video Matrix, User-ActorMatrix and User-Keyword Matrix, respectively.
Atbeginning, these three matrices are sparse becausethey only represent the direct relationships, whichmeans that only when the words appear in user?sweibos, the corresponding position will be set.
Afterthat, we propose a ?hidden layer?
to detect theindirect relationships, making them denser.With these indirect relationships, we can improveusers?
demographic predictions, including gender,age, education background, and marital status.
Thispaper makes the followings three contributions:1.
By construct three matrices, we detect thedirect and indirect relationships between weibousers and video describing words.2.
Two models are proposed to predict users?demographics by using both direct and indirectrelationships.3.
Experiment results prove that our efforts cansignificantly improve the predictive accuracy,compared with the existing research.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 introduces the dataset and demographics.Section 3 introduces how to make full use of videorelated behaviors.
Section 4 presents experimentalresults.
Finally, we review related work in Section5, and draw conclusions in Section 6.2 Dataset and Demographics2.1 DatasetWe collected 2,970,642 microblog users from Weibo(http://weibo.com), the largest microblog servicein China, as our dataset.
To avoid spam users(sometimes called robot users), we only collectedverified users and users followed by verified user.Weibo conducts manual verifications to make surethe verified users provide real and authentic profileinformation.
Table 1 presents four target demo-graphic attributes and the completion rates (ratio ofeffective users).
All data is either through Open APIor publicly available.
No private data is used in theexperiment.We also collected 847 popular video programsfrom YISQ (4 popular video websites in China:youku, iqiyi, sohu, qq).
These videos mainly fall intothree types: movie, tv play, and variety shows.
Wedownloaded these videos?
Homepages and extractedtheir actors and TOP20 TF-IDF words.
The statisticsare shown in Table 2.2.2 Ground TruthOne problem of our dataset is it contains celebrities,while our model mainly targets ordinary weibousers.
We implement a filter to exclude celebritiesbased on their large numbers of followers (>50000as default), making the ground truth more represen-tative.
Besides, users with less than 100 messagesare discarded.
At last, we obtain 742,323 accountswith both their demographics and messages.2.3 DemographicsAs Table 1 shows, the demographic attributes con-cerned in this paper include gender, age, educationbackground, and marital status:Gender (Binary): the gender prediction is atypical binary classification task: male, female.Age (4-Class): because there is only a handfulof(<1%) user older than 45, we classify users intothe following four age groups: Teenage (<18),Youngster (18-24), Young (25-34), Mid-age (>34).Education Background (Binary): we categorizeusers?
education background into two groups: uni-versity, non-university.Marital Status (Binary): marital status is alsosimplified to a binary classification task: single,non-single.3 Our ModelIn this section, we introduce the framework, whichcontains four steps.1360Attribute Completion Rate CategoriesGender 95.019% Male, FemaleAge 18.604% Teenage (<18), Youngster (18-24), Young (25-34), Mid-age(>34)Education BG 17.443% University, Non-UniversityMarital Status 2.203% Single, Non-SingleTable 1: Demographic attributes and corresponding categoriesVideo Actor KeywordVariety show 344 1007 2925Movie 306 741 2049TV 197 515 1302Total 847 1422 4094Table 2: Statics of video relevant information (There is anoverlap between the three collections of actors and keywords.
)The first step generates the ?Video describingwords?
and represents user as two vectors (Vv, Vo).Vv consists of user?s ?video describing words?
andVo consists of user?s ?other words?.
At first, Vv onlycontains user?s direct relationships.Vv: video describing words (direct)Vo: other wordsVa: Vv + VoThe second step detects the indirect relationshipsbetween users and videos.
For example, if a usermentioned ?Robert Downey Jr?, we believe he hasan indirect relationships with ?Iron Man?
movie.
Bydoing so, we add user?s indirect relationships into hisVv, getting a denser vector V ?v .V ?v : video describing words (direct+indirect)V ?a: V ?v + VoThe third step proposes two models respectivelyto evaluate whether those indirect relationships,discovered in second step, can be used to developa more accurate prediction model.The fourth step represents weibo user with thecombination of V ?v and Vo, and use the combinationto train a linear SVM to evaluate whether this effortcan make the prediction better.3.1 Discover Indirect RelationshipsIf a user mentioned a video?s name directly, webelieve there is a direct relationship between them.The rests are unobvious relationships.
In this part,we calculate whether these unobvious relationshipscan be transformed into indirect ones.3.1.1 User-Video MatrixFirstly, we detect whether a user directly men-tioned a video program in his weibo messages.There are two scenarios: the first is this user postsa message containing the video?s name directly, andthe other is this user reposts a message containingthe video?s name.
In this paper, we believe these twoscenarios both indicate there is a direct relationshipbetween the user and the video, and do not make adistinction between them.
Till now, we construct aDirect User-Video Matrix (DUVM) to denote all thedirect relationships between users and videos.Step 1: We know each video program vn containssome actors anj and keywords wni.
We cancalculate P (vn), P (anj |vn) and P (wni|vn) in Step1.
P (vn) represents the probability that a personhas watched the nth video.
P (wni|vn) representsthe probability that a person, who has watched thenth video, mention the nith keyword.
P (anj |vn) isthe probability that a person, who has watched thenth video, mention the njth actor.P (vn) = num (users watched the nth video) /num (users)P (wni|vn) = num (users watched the nth videoand mentioned the nith keyword) / num (userswatched the nth video)P (anj |vn) = num (users watched the nth videoand mentioned the njth actor) / num (users watchedthe nth video)Step 2: In step 2, If a user doesn?t mention avideo?s name directly, but mentions the video?s relat-ed actors (Ak) and keywords (Wm), we can updatehis unobvious user-video relationships according toa Bayesian framework.1361Figure 1: (1) At first, identify the describing words from users microblogs, which builds the direct relationships between users andthese words.
(2) By construct three matrices, we detect the indirect relationships between weibo users and video describing words.
(3)Two models are proposed to predict users demographics by using both direct and indirect relationships.P (vn|Wm, Ak) =P (Wm, Ak|vn) ?
P (vn)P (Wm, Ak)=?wni?Wm P (wni|vn) ?
?anj?Ak P (anj |vn) ?
P (vn)P (Wm, Ak)(1)Through Step 2, we can discover some newindirect relationships and update UVM.
Go back toStep 1 and iterate until converges, we can get theFinal UVM at last.3.1.2 User-Actor MatrixEvery video program has several actors, and therelationships between weibo users and actors maycontribute to the demographic prediction either.
Sowe build the UAM, where each row represents aweibo user and each column represents an actor.There are two case that the element of UAM willbe set to true: (1) the user ?i?
directly mentionedactor ?j?
in his weibo messages (including post andrepost); (2) the user ?i?
has watched video ?v?, andactor ?j?
participate in video ?v?.
The second caseneeds UVM?s help.
We suppose these two casesaffect the value equally in this paper.3.1.3 User-Keyword MatrixWe can find several keywords to describe eachvideo from their Homepages.
For instance, weget ?Paul Walker?, ?fight?, and ?car?
to describe?Furious 7?.Each row of UKM represents a weibo user andeach column represents a keyword of a certain video.
(1) If we find a user has watched the ?Furious 7?, nomatter direct or indirect relationship, we can set thecolumns of user?s ?Furious 7?
keywords to true.
(2)The value can be set to true either if the user directlymentioned these keywords.3.2 Two Indirect Relationship Based ModelsIn this part, two models are proposed to predict user-s?
demographics by using both direct and indirectrelationships.3.2.1 Discriminant Model (Dis-Model)Given three matrices, the intuitive way to predictusers?
demographics is using Collaborative Filter-ing.
However, finding the similar users directlybased on the vector similarity is not a good idea,because a substantial part of users have ever watchedno more than 10 videos.
Matrix Factorization hasbeen proven useful to address data sparsity, forthe reduced orthogonal dimensions are less noisythan the original data and can capture the latentassociations between users and videos.
In ourDis-Model, we utilize the factorization machines(Rendle, 2010) to deal with UVM, UAM, andUKM, reducing the length of user?s dimensionalityfrom videos?

Every weibo user canbe represented by the combination of these three K-length vectors.Over the last several decades, many kinds ofdiscriminant classifier have been created.
Forour four tasks, we compared Logistic Regression(LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and GradientBoosted Decision Tree (GBDT).
Figure 2 illustratestheir performance, where GBDT performs the bestin all K values.
When K increases from 5 to 20, allclassifiers?
results are all getting better and tend tobe stable when K is bigger than 20.
So we chooseGBDT as our default base classifier and K=20 asdefault value.3.2.2 Generative Model (Gen-Model)We start with introducing an important concept:video demographic tendency, which means to whatextent a video belongs to a specified demographicgroup.
For example, if 90% audiences of a movie aremales, we define its demographic tendency on maleas 90%.
The actor tendency and keyword tendencycan be calculated in the same way.In the Gen-Model, (1) we firstly calculate eachvideo?s (actor, keyword) demographic tendency ac-cording to its audiences (known demographics).
(2) Based on the demographic tendency of videos(actors, keywords), we predict user?s (unknown)demographics via a Bayesian method.
(3) At last,we propose a smooth step to adjust the result.
(1) Calculate video demographic tendencyAt first, we calculate every video demographictendency as Equation 2:p(c|vj) =?ni=1(rij ?
ui(c))?ni=1 rij(2)P (c|vj) represents the jth video?s demographictendency on c, where c is the demographic attribute.rij will be set to 1 if the ith user has watched thejth video, otherwise set to 0. ui(c) is a boolean,representing whether the ith user has the attribute c.(2) Calculate user demographic attributeIn this step, we predict users?
demographicsaccording to the demographic tendency of the videosthey has watched.
Suppose user?s viewing habitsare independent, we can calculate the probability ofP (c|ui) as Equation 3:P (c|ui) ?
P (c|{V })?
P ({V }|c) ?
P (c)??vj?
{V }P (vj |c) ?
P (c)=?vj?
{V } P (c|vj) ?
P (vj)P (c) ?
P (c)??vj?
{V }P (c|vj)(3){V } represents the collection of videos watchedby ui.
P (c|vj) is the jth video?s demographictendency on c, as the previous part described.
(3) Smooth the resultBased on the fact that people in same demograph-ic group may have similar behaviors, we deploy asmooth component to adjust the value of P (c|vj)and P (c|ui) according to their top n neighbors.
Asmentioned above, we use factorization machinesto transform the user and video vectors into low-dimensional (K=20) ones.
The distance is cal-culated by Euclidean Distance.
The video, actor,and word have the same treating process, so weintroduce the video as representative.Smooth the Video?s Demographic Tendency: Baseon video vj?s top n neighbors, we can calcu-late its neighbors?
average demographic tendencyP (c|nbr(vj)), where P (c|vnbj) is vj?s nbjth neigh-bor?s demographic tendency.1363p(c|nbr(vj)) =?nj=1 P (c|vnbj)n (4)Therefore, we can smooth vj?s demographictendency by:P (c|vj) = ?
?
P (c|vj) + (1?
?)
?
P (c|nbr(vj)) (5)?
is the parameter to control the top n neighbors?influence.
In this paper, we compared ten values of?
and chose 0.7 as default.
With the same process,n is set to 10 as default.Smooth the User?s Demographic Result: The userside smooth procedure is similar to the video side,except user?s P (c|nbr(ui)) is affected by three kindsof neighbors (unbvi, unbai, unbwi).p(c|nbr(ui)) =?ni=1 P (c|unbvi)3n +?ni=1 P (c|unbai)3n+?ni=1 P (c|unbwi)3n(6)Just like video?s smooth process, we adjust ui?sdemographic attributes by:P (c|ui) = ?
?
P (c|ui) + (1?
?)
?
P (c|nbr(ui)) (7)The smooth component is deployed as an iterativeprocedure, and keeps running until each P (c|ui)became stable.Two Baselines: To validate whether those indi-rect relationships can improve the predictions, webuild two baseline models: Dis-Baseline and Gen-Baseline.
While our two models use the V ?v as input,these two baseline models use the raw Vv.
These twobaseline models adopt the same architecture withour proposed two models.
The only difference is theinput data.3.3 Fusion ModelAs described above, we discovered the indirectrelationships between users and video describingwords, and demonstrated this effort can leading abetter result than directly train the classifier.0 10 20 3023456 Relationships TendencyIterationsUser VideoRelationshipsFigure 3: Tendency of User-Video relationship number.But pre-existing models commonly utilize all thewords in user?s weibo messages.
So we need to findout whether our hard-earned improvement would besubmerged by those ?Non video describing words?.We train a Fusion Model using all the words inweibo messages and indirect relationships together,and compare it with a baseline model, who only useall the words (without indirect relationships).Fusion Baseline: Many pre-existing methods(Burger et al, 2011; Tu et al, 2015) chose linearmodel as their text classifier, for linear model issuitable for text categorization tasks.
We chooseL1-regularized linear SVM as our Fusion Modeland Fusion-Baseline?s classifier.
The only differencebetween them is the input data (V ?v + Vo vs Vv + Vo).4 Experiment ResultsWe conducted a 10-fold cross validation to demon-strate our framework?s effectiveness, where 8 partsfor training, 1 parts for validation and 1 parts fortesting by default.
The performance of presentedmethods were evaluated using the Precision, Recalland Macro-F1 measures.
Binary classification taskswere also measured by Area Under the ROC Curve(AUC).4.1 Indirect Relationships EvaluationIn our dataset, each user directly mention 2.6 videoprograms on average and only 0.7% has more than10 direct relationships.
As shown in Figure 3, moreand more indirect relationships arise along with theiterations.
User?s relationship number (direct +indirect) stabilized at 5.7 on average and 13% ofthem is bigger than 10.To answer whether these indirect relationships1364Precision Recall F1 AUCGenderDis-Baseline 0.720 0.714 0.717 0.730Dis-Model 0.786 0.779 0.783 0.812 ?

Classes have been balanced.can make the prediction better, we compared our twomodels (Dis-Model & Gen-Model) with two base-line models.
We also compared their performanceon different user groups categorized by user-videorelationship number.Gender: As Table 3 shows, our two modelsboth have a significant improvement compared tothe baseline models.
The Gen-Model achieve thebest performance (AUC 0.825) in terms of all themeasurement.
As Figure 4(a) shows, with thenumber growth, our two models?
AUC scores areboth getting better.
Surprisingly, when the numberis bigger than 10, the Gen-Model even get a similarperformance of the model using all of the user?swords.Age: In the age task, our two models bothoutperformed the baseline models significantly, andthe generative model performs better (F1 0.654) too.We analyzed the result and found the ?youngster?and ?young?
share the similar watching habits inWeibo.
It?s hard to pick out a 23 years old user fromthe 28 years old group.
As Figure 4(b) shows, ourtwo models?
F1 scores are both getting better alongwith the growth of user-video relationship number.Education Background: Not surprisingly, ourtwo models obviously outperform the result overtwo baseline models.
This result indicates thatpeople in different education background has visibledifferent tastes on video programs.Marital Status: Table 3 presents the results ofmarital status.
We notice that the performance ofour two model is still reasonable, but is worse thangender and education tasks.
In addition to that thistask is more difficulty, another reason is when a usergets married, he might not update the information inhis online profile.Remark: Experiment results show that ourmethod can significantly improve these words?demographic predictive ability by more than 15%on average.
10 videos is good enough to portray aweibo user, and can achieve reasonable results inthese 4 inference tasks.
The video related behavioris efficient on predicting gender and education, forpeople on these two tasks have visible differentinclinations.
Inferring age and marital status is noteasy, but our two models still achieve reasonableimprovements.
In general, our two models bothget significantly better results than baselines.
TheGen-Model is a better choice by contrast.4.2 Fusion Model EvaluationAfter we obtained the potential predictive abilityof indirect relationships, we also need to find outwhether it can help pre-existing model perform13656 8 10 120.760.780.80.820.840.86User?Video relationship numberAUCAUC of Gender (Binary)Dis?ModelGen?Model(a) AUC of Gender6 8 10 120.60.650.7User?Video relationship numberF1 ScoreF1 Score of Age (Multi?class)Dis?ModelGen?Model(b) F1 Score of Age6 8 10 120.760.780.80.820.840.86User?Video relationship numberAUCAUC of Education BG (Binary)Dis?ModelGen?Model(c) AUC of Education BG6 8 10 120.650.70.75User?Video relationship numberAUCAUC of Marital Status (Binary)Dis?ModelGen?Model(d) AUC of Marital StatusFigure 4: Prediction result with varying User-Video relationship numbers.1 2 3 40.650.70.750.8Macro?F1Fusion Model PerformanceBaseline ModelFusion ModelFigure 5: Results of Fusion Model evaluation (Macro-F1).better.
We compare the Fusion Baseline (Vv+Vo)with our Fusion Model (V ?v+Vo).
As Figure 5 shows,Fusion Model?s performance is better than FusionBaseline?s in all four tasks.
The improvement isabout 2-3% on average.
As above mentioned, ourapproach can be applied to other kinds of words,such as describing words on books and music.
Sothere is some room for improvement.5 Related workIn this section, we briefly review the research worksrelated to our work.Many researches (Kumar and Tomkins, 2010;Goel et al, 2012) found users belong to differentdemographic groups behave differently.
(Hu etal., 2007; Murray and Durrell, 2000; Goel etal., 2012; Kosinski et al, 2012) showed that age,gender, education level, and even personality canbe predicted from people?s webpage browsing logs.
(Kosinski et al, 2013; Schwartz et al, 2013;Youyou et al, 2015) showed computers?
judgmentsof people?s personalities based on their FacebookLikes are more accurate and valid than judgmentsmade by their close acquaintances.
(Malmi andWeber, 2016) showed users?
demographics also canbe predicted based on theirs apps.
Apart from thebrowsing behaviors, there also exist some worksbased on user?s linguistic characteristics.
(Schleret al, 2006) analyzed tens of thousands of blogsand indicated significant differences in writing styleand word usage between different gender and agegroups.
The similar result also showed in (Luyckxand Daelemans, 1998; Oberlander and Nowson,2006; Mairesse et al, 2007; Nowson, 2007; Gillet al, 2009; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2011).There are some works (Bi et al, 2013; Weberand Jaimes, 2011; Weber and Castillo, 2010) onpredicting search engine user?s demographics basedon their search queries.
(Hovy, 2015) investigatedthe influence of user?s demographics on betterunderstanding their online reviews.
(Otterbacher,2010) used logistic regression model to infer usersgender based on the content of movie reviews.Many researches focused on the twitter users.In the Author Profiling task at PAN 2015 (Rangelet al, 2015), participants approached the task ofidentifying age, gender and personality traits fromTwitter.
(Nguyen et al, 2013) explored users?
ageprediction task based on their tweets, achievingbetter performance than humans.
(Burger et al,2011) studied the gender predictive ability of twitterlinguistic characteristics, reached 92% accuracy.
(Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011) proposed a GB-DT model to predict users?
age, gender, politicalorientation and ethnicity by leveraging their observ-able information.
(Culotta et al, 2015) predictedthe demographics of Twitter users based on whomthey follow, and (Zhong et al, 2015) predicted themicroblog user?s demographic attributes only bytheir chick-ins.
In (Li et al, 2014), job and educationattributes are extracted by combining a rule basedapproach with a probabilistic system.
There arealso some works based on users?
social relationships1366(Mislove et al, 2010; Henderson et al, 2012; Zhaoet al, 2013).6 ConclusionOur motivation on writing this paper is user?svideo related behavior is usually under-utilized ondemographic prediction tasks.
With the help ofthird-party video sites, we detect the direct andcalculate the indirect relationships between usersand video describing words, and demonstrate thiseffort can improve the accuracy of users?
demo-graphic predictions.
To our knowledge, this is thefirst work which explores demographic predictionby fully using users?
video describing words.
Thisframework has good scalability and can be appliedon other concrete features, such as user?s bookreading behaviors and music listening behaviors.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National GrandFundamental Research 973 Program of China underGrant No.2014CB340405 and the National Nat-ural Science Foundation of China under GrantNo.61572044.ReferencesAdiya Abisheva, Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella, DavidGarcia, and Ingmar Weber.
