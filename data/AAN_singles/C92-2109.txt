IntroductionThe normal method for representing ana-pboric dependencies in Unification Based (UB)grammar formalisms is that of re-entrance(often indicated graphically by means of sub-scripts, as in (lb)).
The interpretation is that twoor more attributes share (are pointers to) a sin-gle value.
In the case of (1), the SUBJ of try isidentical to that of employ.
This means thatchanges to the value of the SUBJ of try (e.g.
theaddition of another feature) are necessarilychanges to the value of the SUBJ of employ.This token identity should be distinguished fromthe type identity between these values, and thevalue of the OBJ attribute in (lb), which justhappens to have the same attributes and values.
(la) Linguists try to employ linguists.This device can be thought of as the attribute-value equivalent of a bound variable of logic,and though it is not appropriate for all kinds ofanaphoric dependence, it is ubiquitous.This paper proposes a novel approach tothe treatment of re-entrances in translation,which overcomes the problems of existingapproaches using UB formalisms.

Section 2 will reviewexisting approaches, pointing out the problems.Section 3 describes the approach, which pro-vides a straightforward treatment of cases wherefiller-gap dependencies are subject to differentconstraints in source and target languages (e.g.where one language allows, and the other for-bids, Preposition Stranding).
In exemplifyingthis, we will focus on the treatment of relativeclauses.

Existing Approaches2.1.
Transfer Bused (Structural) Approaches.Perhaps the most obvious way to use aLIB formalism for translation is to use a stan-dard UB grammar formalism in analysis to pro-duce a feature structure (FS), which is a collec-tion of attribute-value (A:V) pairs.
This is thenmapped to a target FS by means of a bilingualgrammar of transfer ules whose left-hand-sides(lhs) are matched against he source structure,I ~h?r?,  we dL~ctma ca~,es where filler-gap~ntkndm in one language oorreapond toantecedent-pco~oun dependencies in another.ACrEs DE COLING~92, NANTES, 23-28 ao~r 1992 7 2 8 Pgoc.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992and whose fight-hand-sides (rhs) indicate thecontent of the corresponding target FS.
Theserules are applied recursively to successivelysmaller collections of source language A:Vs.This is, of course, just a straightforward adapta-tion of the traditional transfer method to a A:Vdata structure in place of a tree, in particular, itre~mbles a classical transt~:r system in being'structural' i.e.
in involving the decompositionof source structures into smaller objects (on thelhs), and the actual construction of target strUc-tures (on the rhs).
This is essentially theapproach employed in ELU (Estival et al1990)and MiMo2 (van Noord et al1990).Though there is not much discussion ofthe treatment of referential dependencies intmnst'er in these formalisms, it is easy to seehow one can deal with re-entrances which natur-ally fall within the scope of one transfer ule.
InELU, tot example, such re-entrances can betranslated by binding the re-entrant paths withinthe structure to rite same variable and stating ncorrespondence b tween the relevant source sideand the target side variables, in this way there-entrance is translated as one structure.
InMiMo2 the re-entrant paths are separatelytranslated, but the re-entrance is explicitly men-tioned on source and target side, requiringtoken-identity between the results of theseparate translations.
However, these structurebased formalisms do not have any method forgeucral~ing this to cases where re-entrances arenot 'local'.
This is serious, because phenomenaclassically regarded as involving Wh-Movement(e.g.
Wh-Questions, Topicalization, Relativisa-tion, etc.
), are typically of this kind, and forthese phenomena, the formalisms can provideno general treatment.Of course, there are a number of ways inwhich one might try to remedy this inadequacy.For example, one could unfold the re.entrancesas type identities (i.e.
reinterpret the DAG as atree), or 'thread' shared values through thestructure, in such a way that they become local(cf.
standard gap threading techniques to reduceunbounded ependencies to local ones).
How-ever, none are satisfactory.
The former loosesinformation, so that source FS and target FS areno longer equivalent, and causes problems ingeneration, where some method must be foundfor ensuring that lexical content is not dupli-cated, and appears in the right place).
Threadingtechniques are unattractive because of the (oftenextreme) complication they introduce in gram-mars and representations.
22.2.
Constraint Based ApproachesIn this section, we will outline theapproach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al(1989).In LFG projections are linguisticallyrelevant mappings or correspondences betweenlevels, whether these mappings are direct orinvolve function composition (Kaplan (198"0,Halvorscn and Kaplan (1988), Dalrymple (1990)and Dalrymple t al (1990)).
By means of theseprojections, equations can be stated which co-describe elements of the two levels related bythe projection.
The standard projections are V(normally expressed in terms of t and ~,, fromc-structure to f-structure), and o (variously fromc- and f-structure to semantic structures).Kaptan et alextend this approach to providewhat amounts to a transfer lormalism for LFG.
3In their proposal, the equational anguage ofLFG is used to state bilingual constraints orcorrespondences between elements of sourceand target structures.
They introduce mappingfunctions x (between f-structures) and T'(between semantic structures).
Achieving trans-lation can be thought of ns specifying andresolving a set of constraints on target struc-tures, constraints which are expressed by meansof the "~ and x' functions.The formalism permits a wide variety ofsource-target correspondences to be expressed:and ap can be composed, as can x' and o. Equa-lions specifying translations are added to (sourcelanguage) lexiual entries and c-structure rules.For example (2) composes "~ and ap, identifyingthe 'r of the (source) SUBJ f-structure with theSUBJ attribute of the x of the f-structure associ-ated with some node (the value of t), indicatingthat the translation of the value of the SUB3 slotin a source f?structure fills the SUB3 slot in thef-structure which is tile translation of that source2 The possibility of a 'threading' aplnoech iahintedat in van Noord et d (1990).
The formalism describedin Pu\[man (ed) (1991) seems to allow an intc~atingvariation, where instead of threading infonalatiotl aboutnon-local re-eaatmnee throttgh the ~oorce atmetom, it inthreaded through the 'virtual' atructur~ that am builtthe tmlmfer mechanisms reeura~ through the aoeneestructure.
This still tk~e~ nol avoid the htmic objection tothe toe of auch techhiquea, however.3 See Sadler ,t a/ (1990), Sadler and Thompson(1991), and Fmdler (1991) for further disctmaion of thisapl~oach toMT.ACtES DI" COLING-92, NAmEs.

(2) T(tStmJ) - (Tt SUm)In this approach, then, relations betweendifferent ypes of linguistic description (i.e.
lev-els) are defined in terms of correspondencefunetiom, not by means of the re.cursive appli-cation of rules to source language structures.
Inparticular, notice thai tmmfer does not opomtecompositionally on a source language featurestructure, rather the analysis procedure collectssets of constraints on various structures, includ-ing ('0 constraints on target structures.
Thesolution of a set of z equations is a (probablyincomplete) target f-structure which must thenbe completed and validated by the target gram-mar.
This allows information which is exhaus-tively determined by the target grammar to beignored in the transfer prooms.
4 In this sense,the system is constraint-based, rather than struc-ture baaed like the approaches described in 2.1.above, and it has different expteasive possibili-ties.As regards relative clauses, Kaplan et alassume a reasonably standard LFG analysis:wh-relatives are represented asan attribute (hereRELMOD) which contains a re.untruncebetween the values of a RELTOPIC plLrese anda within-clause function (see (8) below).
Theapproach to translating these dependenciesinvolves stating separate correspondences forboth the within clause function and the RELTO-PIC function.For a simple example like (3), withEnglish as source language, the rules are as in(4-7) and the English and (incomplete) Frenchf-structures as in (8) and (9) (the indices hereare simply informal devices to allow easy refer-ence to pieces of f-structure).(3)a.

1992with the equations given in the lexical entries(6) and (7) to create a re-untrance in the targetstructure (9) corresponding to that in (8).
Thiscan be seen by looking at the relevant con-stmints, in (10), which are derived from theseroles in relation to (8) and (9).
Since x is afunction, ( fx RELTOPIC) and ( ft OBJ) musthe the same token.
Hence the desired re-entrance falls out automatically.

On closer inspection, the exampleKaplan et aluse to demonstrate heir approachdoes not work correctly, giving the ungrammati-cal (11c) instead of the correct (l lb).

Although it seems at flintsight that the approach nicely preserves re-entrances in tramlation, in fact what happens isthat the source grammar dictates what will bere-entrant on the target side.
Thus, though theKaplan et alapproach provides a simple methodfor projecting source language re-entrances ontothe target language structures, the method isinsufficiently flexible in the scope allowed forvariation between source and target structures.3.
Using UnderspeclflcatlonCharacteristic of the approaches de.acrthedin 2.1. and 2.2. is that they mmslate beth 'ends'of a re-entrance.
Because in structure based sys-tems the translation relation is defined entirelyby rules, the scope of the re-entrances that canbe handled is limited by that of rules.
A con-straint based approach avoids this problem --under the approach described in 2.2 separate xcorrespondences are supplied for both pathsinvolved in the re-entrance (both the sourceRELTOPIC, and the source within-clause func-tion).
Because these correspondences apply x tof-structure descriptions which evaluate to thesame object, a target re-entrance is automati-7 'l'his representation embodiee an number of que~-tiotmble ~umptiotm about the treatment of r, whichnot relevant tothe di~u~io~.ACRES DE COLING-92, NAN'I .a~s, 23-28 AOt)r 1992 7 3 l PROC.

However, as we have seen, thisapproach does not permit factorization of sourceand target oriented information in these cases.In this section we will explore a solution to thisproblem which involves restricting "~ correspon-dences to just one of  the paths involved in thesource re-entrance, allowing a constraint basedtreatment of cases including those in (11)above.

The solution of  thefunctional uncertainty equation in this case hap-pens m be ( tRELTOPIC) - ( tOBJ ) .

This gives(18) as one solution.Of course, this cannot simply be added tothe other x equations (if it were, it would estab-lish a re-entrance between RELTOPIC andOBLso O13.I, which would give an ungrammati-cal result, with a stranded preposition, as in(11c) above).Second, the monolingual target grammarwill contain a constraint o ensure that, if REL-TOPIC is present, some path within the REL-TOPIC attribute contains the attribute value pairWH-+.
This is required to prevent the 'topical-izing' (i.e.
wh-movement fronting within therelative clause) of any XP which does not con-tain a wh-phrase.
Simplifying slightly, we takethis equation to be:(19) (T RELTOPIC{OBJ,  POSS}* WH) -c+Third, the target grammar itself contains afunctional uncertainty equation for establishinga relation between RELTOPIC and somewithin-clause function, which, for the sake ofargument we could assume to be us in (20).Notice that this is more restrictive than thecorresponding English constraint, which allowedidentity between the values of a wide variety ofGFs and the RELTOPIC.
This restricts it toSUBJ, O13.I, and 'thematic'  OBLiques (whichincludes OBLgo), excluding the possibility ofpreposition stranding.

It can he interpreted efcasi-bly in combination with the target informationto lind the closest possible solution consistentwith the target grammar.
This closest solutionemerges from comparing the constraint with thefunctional uncertainty equations for the targetlanguage.
In the case of relative clauses, atleast, there are two target functional uncertaintyequations o- the first expresses a re-entlancebetween the value of RELTOPIC and the valueof some within clause function, and the secondrequires RELTOPIC to contain a WH~+ path((1.9) and (20)).If the source-derived equation is con-sistent with the target constraints, then it ischosen.
If it is not, then the closest solution ischosen.
Note that the shortest path in (19)would have just the wh-item in RELTOPIC (theOBJ of the preposition).
But this is ruled outby (20), which disallows OBLg o OBJ as the hot-tom of the mm~rtainty path.
The "closest" solu-tion is defined as the pemfissibie solution whicficontains the minimal solution of  the equation(19) (which requires RELTOPIC to contain a+WH item).
In this case, that solution is:(21) (1' OBL~o) - (1' RELTOPIC)(22) (~' RELTOPIC OBJ WH) - +In cobiuation with the other constraints, this willgive a representation like (23), corresponding, to(11)b, as intended.

But the mechanism canbe applied equally well to derive "smaller"RELTOPIC phrases from "larger" structures, asin the English -* French pair in (24), and canbe extended to deal with 'strategy mismatches'of the kind exemplified in (25), whine a 'gap '  inone language corresponds to a resumptive pro-noun in another (see Arnold and Sadler 1992).

A~,~ here, the basic idea would be totranslate the material in rite within clause posi-tion only, ignoring the RELTOPIC position, andthen create a re-entrance on the target side.There are at least two problems.
First, in stun>tuml approaches, the normal operation oflmnsi~er requires soure kind of completenesscheck to eusure that all parts of the sourcestructure are translated.
Nomlally, this can beinterpreted as a check that every path in thesource object has been visited.
Thus, for thisapproach to work, one would need rule.,; thatexplicitly translate the value of RELTOPIC usnil ('deleting' it).
One could, alternatively, tryto redefine completeness in terms of translationof all values (since the RELTOPIC and thewithin clause position have the same value,translating either would count as translatingboth).
This would mean one could avoid therules explicitly deleting the RELTOPIC, but it isnot clear what consequences it would have elseowhere.
The second problem is more serious.
Theoutput of transfer will produce a structure likeman \[ \[\] 1 have seen who\], and one will needroles to create a link between the RELTOPICposition (/\]), and who.
But one cannot, in gen~eral, assume that such rules will exist.
Forexample, they will not exist if the target gram-mar creates links as part of  the parsing processtitat creates A:V structures (e.g.
if they are asso-ciated with c-structure rules), and even if theyate rules that can be applied to already con?structed A:V structurns, it cannot be guaranteedthat they will apply to configurations uch asthis (since they will have been written to applyto cases where the lexical material (who) f-commands the 'gap' ;  but in the structures outputfrom transter, the relationship will be thereverse.Ac'l~s I)E COLING-92, NAmI.

ConclusionWe have shown in this paper that theapproach to transfer between feature structuresintroduced in Kaplan et al1989 can beexploited to deal with the translation of ana-phoric dependeneins.
Our proposal exploits theconstraint based (rather than structure based)nature of the approach, and the flexibility thatcomes from being able to underspecify variousparts of the translation relation, and allow infor-nmtion (i.e.
constraints) from source language,and target grammar to interact with bilingualinformation.References(Abbreviations: TMI, International Conferenceon Theoretical and Methodological Issues inMachine Tmmlation; EACL, Conference of theEuropean Chapter of the Association for Com-putational Linguistics).1.
