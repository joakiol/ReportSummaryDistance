eduAbst rac tIn this paper, we want to show how themorphological component of an existingNLP-system for Dutch (Dutch MedicalLanguage Processor - DMLP) has been ex-tended in order to produce output that iscompatible with the language independentmodules of the LSP-MLP system (Linguis-tic String Project - Medical Language Pro-cessor) of the New York University.
Theformer can take advantage of the languageindependent developments of the latter,while focusing on idiosyncrasies for Dutch.This general strategy will be illustrated bya practical application, namely the high-lighting of relevant information in a pa-tient discharge summary (PDS) by meansof modern HyperText Mark-Up Language(HTML) technology.
Such an applicationcan be of use for medical administrativepurposes in a hospital environment.1 Introduct ionMedical patient reports consist mainly of free text.While numerical data can be stored and processed(relatively) easily, free text is rather difficult to pro-cess by a computer, although in many cases it con-tains the most relevant information.The use of natural language does not facilitate theautomation of.
these tasks and hinders access to thewealth of medical information.
However, natural lan-guage still is the most frequently used and easiestway to transmit complex messages (Scherrer et ah,1989).
Hence, some authors consider the study andapplication of Natural Language Processing (NLP)in Medicine (Scherrer et" al., 1989), (McCray et ah.1995), (Chute, 1997) as one of the most challengingissues in the field of medical information retrieval(Baud et al, 1992a), (Friedman and Johnson, 1992).Up till now, not many NLP-driven systems have ac-tually been implemented (Spyns, 1996b).
A conciseoverview of NLP-based information retrieval tech-niques for clinical narrative can be found in (Hersh,1996, chapter 11, pp.
211-323).A possible nvironment for (medical) informationretrieval is the Medical Registration Department ofa hospital, and more in particular the medical en-coding service.
Clinical data in free text format arereplaced by a set of numerical codes that summarisethe content of the entire document.
In general, thepatient discharge summary (PDS), being a synthe-sis of the patient stay, is used for the encoding andabstracting task instead of the entire medical record(Duisterhout, 1996).
An important aspect of med-ical encoding consists of a thorough review of thePDS in order to discover the relevant words (diag-noses, surgical deeds, interventional equipment etc.
)(Bowman, 1996, p.216).
The aim of the NLP-basedHTML application presented below is to speed upthe reviewing process by displaying a PDS and high-lighting the keywords.The following sections provide details about someaspects of NLP systems for medical English (section2.1: LSP-MLP) and Dutch (section 2.2: DMLP), andhow results can be exchanged between them (sec-tion 2.3).
Only some parts of the DMLP and LSP-MLP systems will be presented, namely those thatare of importance for the experiment described be-low.
Next to the NLP back-end, the user interfaceis described as well (section 2.4).
The limitationsof the current test are described in section 3 andsome future directions for research are provided inthe fourth and final section.2 Mater ia l  and  Methods2.1 The Linguistic String Project  - MedicalLanguage ProcessorThe Linguistic String Project.
- Medical LanguageProcessor (LSP-MLP) of the New York University182is the first (and up till now the longest lasting) largescale project about NLP in Medicine (Sager et al,1987), (Sager et al, 1995a).
The LSP-MLP hasalso been ported to French and German, which il-lustrates the general applicability of its methodologyand approach (Nhkn et al, 1989), (Oliver, 1992).The reason of its generality lies in the use of a welldefined underlying linguistic theory (distributional-ism) (Harris, 1962), (Sager et al, 1981) and a scien-tifically based sublanguage approach (Grishman andKittredge, 1986).Important for the present discussion is the seman-tic selection level of the LSP-MLP.
All the wordsin the LSP dictionary are characterised by labelsthat indicate to which sublanguage word class(es)the words belong (e.g., H-TTCHIR: "contains generaland specific surgical treatment or procedure wordswhich imply or denote surgical intervention by thephysician" (Sager et al, 1987, p.268); H-TXPlZOC:"contains medical test words designating proceduresperformed on the patient and not on a patient spec-iment.
The patient must be present o undergo thetest" (Sager et al, 1987, p.264) ).
An overviewof the actual set of labels and word classes can befound in (Sager et al, 1995a).
The semantic se-lection module uses distributionally established co-occurrence patterns of medical word classes to im-prove the parse tree by resolving cases of structuralambiguity (Hirschman, 1986).
Consider the sentence63 "operatieve procedure: vijfvoudige coronaire by-pass."
1 displayed in figure 4.
The word "proce-dure" is semantically ambiguous because it has twosemantic labels: H-TTCHIR ~: H-TXPROC.
Thanksto the co-occurrence patterns for the medical sub-language, only the label that is valid in this context(H-TTCHIR) is ultimately selected.
In another con-text (e.g.
: test procedure: ...), another co-occurrencepattern will apply and select the H-TXPROC reading.Other examples of resolution of word sense ambigui-ties by means of co-occurrence patterns can be foundin (Sager et al, 1987, pp.83, 95).The very latest work includes the use of Stan-dard Generalized Mark-up Language (SGML) andWorld Wide Web (WWW) Graphical User Interface(GUI) technology to access and visualise better therequested information i  the text (Sager et al, 1996).It focused on the use of static SGML or HTML-code2 for displaying the results of NLP-based checklistscreening of clinical documents.1English: surgical procedure: quintuple coronarybypass.2 "Static" HTML code eliminates the need for an onthe fly conversion of the HTML file ("dynamic" HTMLcode) as presented in section 2.4.2.2 The  Dutch Medical  Language ProcessorFor the Dutch medical anguage, an NLP system ofa medium sized coverage has been designed and im-plemented: the Dutch Medical Language Processor(DMLP) (Spyns, 1996c).
With respect o the mor-phological level, there is a full form dictionary storedin the relational database format (currently some100.000 full forms that are mostly non-compoundwordforms) (Dehaspe, 1993).
If necessary, a recog-niser characterises the unknown word forms morpho-logically (Spyns, 1994).
Subsequently, a contextualdisambiguation component tries to reduce the num-ber of morphological readings (Spyns, 1995).As the syntactic level uses a "logic variant" of theLSP grammar formalism (Hirschman and Dowding,1990), the Dutch morpho-syntactic module (Spynsand Adriaens, 1992) can replace the LSP parser.Many of the LSP-MLP medical co-occurrence pat-terns are practically identical for English, Frenchand German, so that the application of these pat-terns to Dutch parse trees can lead to interestingresults, namely the feasibility of reusing the non lan-guage specific parts of the LSP-MLP for Dutch med-ical NLP (Spyns, 1996a).2.3 The  DMLP/LSP-MLP  connect ionThe linguistic data are passed on from the DMLP tothe LSP-MLP system via syntactic parse trees.
Thisis due to the fact that the selection module takes syn-tactic relationships into account during the semanticdisambiguating phase.The linguistic information of the DMLP and theLSP-MLP systems correspond in a high degree.
Se-mantic word class labels, which were originally notforeseen in the Dutch lexicon, had to be added.
Aparse tree transducer delivers nearly genuine DutchLSP-MLP trees (Spyns, 1996a).
Although on theside of the LSP-MLP some new sublanguage seman-tic co-occurrence patterns had to be defined, theco-occurrence patterns are highly language indepen-dent.
This was in line with results earlier achieved.An example (see figure 1) shows the output of theparse tree transducer that reshapes the DMLP treeinto the required LSP-MLP format.
The currentstate of the transducer allows to transform nearlyall the parse trees.2.4 The  WWW inter faceThe basic idea was that when treating a patient, itis considered to be helpful to reread the admissionhistory, the discharge summary, or other importantparts of the medical record.183((SENTENCE(TEXTLET(OLDSENT(INTRODUCER(LN (TPOS (NULL))(QPOS (NULL))(APOS (AD.\]ADJ (LAR (LA (NULL))(AVAR (ADJ='OPERATIEVE': ('OPERATIEF') "('OPERATIEF')))(RA (NULL)))))(NPOS (NULL)))(N='PROCEDURE':(F SINGULAR) " ('PROCEDURE'))(,: ,=,:,:  (,:,) - (,:,)))(CENTER(FRAGMENT(SA (NULL))(NSTGF(NSTG(LNR(LN (TPOS (NULL))(QPOS (NULL))(APOS (ADJADJ (EAR (LA (NULL))(AVAR (ADJ='VIJFVOUDIGE': ('VIJFVOUDIG') " ('VIJFVOUDIG')))(RA (NULL)))(ADJADJ (LAR (LA (NULL))(AVAR (ADJ='CORONAIRE':('CORONAIR') " ('CORONAIR')))(RA (NULL))))))(NPOS (NULL)))(NVAR (N='BYPASS':(SINGULAR) " ('BYPASS')))(RN (NULL)))))(SA (NULL))))(ENDMARK ('.'='.

\[surgical procedure: quintuple coronary bypass\]The highlighting of medical concepts ofinterest makes it possible to scan a docu-ment quickly, focusing on a particular typeof information, such as Symptoms and Di-agnoses, or Treatments resolved (?, p.26).Also for the medico-administrative activities, sucha tool can also be helpful.
Medical secretaries have tosummarise patient discharge summaries by "trans-lating" them into a fixed set of numerical codes ofa classification (ICD-9-CM (Commission of Profes-sional and Hospital Activities, 1978)).
These codes(indirectly) serve for statistical and financial pur-poses.
If the most important relevant terms forthe encoding task (essentially the H-DIAG (diagno-sis) and the H-TTCHIR (surgical deed) words) arealready highlighted, the human encoder is able todetect hem more rapidly so that the encoding speedcan be improved.The documents are morphologically and syntacti-cally analysed by the DMLP first, the resulting parsetrees being made conform to the LSP-format, andsubsequently passed 3 on to the LSP-MLP.The LSP subselection module generates a pseudo-HTML file consisting of semantic labels and the ter-minal elements of the parse trees.
The file withthe pseudo-HTML codes (see figure 3) could eas-ily have been generated by the morphological com-ponent of the DMLP as well.
In some occasions,it would be better to do so as the DMLP-LSP treeconverter sometimes changes the word order.
On theother hand, no advantage can then be taken fromthe sublanguage co-occurrence patterns for seman-tic disambiguation.
Semantically ambiguous wordswill thus be highlighted more than once, which isbad for the precision score (more non relevant wordsare flagged).
Without full fledged linguistic analysis,some ambiguities will not be resolved (?, p.27).
Ascan be seen in figure 2 (and thus also in figure 3),the ambiguity for the word "procedure" in sentence63 is resolved.
The node number 2 only has the labelH-TTCHIR.3Currently, the files are transmitted by e-mail.184SENTENCETEXTLETOLDSENT .

The NLP processing of a load of PDSscan be done in batch during the night so that thethroughput of the encoder is not affected in the neg-ative sense.63< H - T I~HIR> operatieve </H - T I "CHIR>< H-  T I~HIR> procedure </H - T I~HIR>< H - TMREP> vijfvoudige </H-  TMREP>< H - PTPART> coronaire </H-  PTPART>< H-T ICHIR> bypass </H-TTCHIR>Figure3: pseudo-HTML code generated after jointDMLP/LSP-MLP processing for the sentence in fig-ure 1The GUI consists of two WWW-pages.
The firstpage is conceived as a menu window.
Two selectionboxes allow the medical encoder to choose a textand the semantic labels.
Currently, the set of PDSsis limited to nine texts.
In the future, HTML-filesfor an unrestricted and varying number of PDSs willhave to be produced.
Before the encoder can startto view the NLP-processed PDSs, the HTML-codeof the menu-page needs to be updated to include allthe (path)names of the files concerned.
This caneasily be achieved by activating before each encodingsession a C-shell script that scans a subdirectory andcreates an actualised HTML-file for the menu page.Only the " < OPTION ></OPT ION >" lines ofthe first choice box need to be adapted.Through the HTML SUBMIT command, the op-tions selected by the medical encoder are passed (viaa FORM and CGI-SCRIPT) to an external C-program.The C-program takes the filename and the requestedsublanguage label(s) as parameters and generates185a new HTML-file by replacing the occurrences ofthe concerned label(s) by a genuine HTML-code(< STRONG > & </STRONG >) around the rel-evant words).
This temporary file is directly fed intothe browser and displayed as a second WWW-page("PDS-page").
The words marked (= belonging tothe selected semantic sublanguage word class) aredisplayed in boldface.
As the pseudo-HTML codesare ignored by the browser, the rest of the PDS isdisplayed in a "neutral" way.Figure 4 shows the menu-page and PDS-page inwhich words concerning the diagnosis (H-DIAG), thesurgical procedure (tt-TTCHIR) and the bodypart (H-PTPART) are marked.
The PDS-page is the bottomright part of the figure and partly overlaps the menu-page, which shows the selected PDS and labels 4.3 Evaluation & ResultsBefore a large scale validation involving "a goldstandard" and various statistical metrics (e.g.
see(Hripcsak et al, 1995)) is set up and conducted,a modest formative evaluation (Hirschman andThompson, 1995) allowed to rapidly assess the func-tionality of the application from the point of view ofthe actual user.
A limited validation test has beenset up.
A sample of 100 Dutch sentences of varyinglength and syntactic omplexity was selected.
All thewords in the dictionary covering the 100 sentenceswere manually tagged with LSP semantic word classlabels.
The medical doctor supervising the medi-cal registration activities was asked to provide somecombinations of semantic labels relevant from the4The translation of the document PDS6 is as follows:61 On 21/1/87 your patient has been operated in ourcardiovascular surgery unit.62 Pre-operative diagnosis: coronary sclerosis.63 Operative procedure: quintuple coronary bypass.64 Reconstruction of the left arteria mammaria on theLAD.65 Venal jump graft from the aorta to the diagonalis,further to the LAD.66 Venal jump graft from the aorta to the first branchof the circumflexus, further to the second branch ofthe circumflexus, till the RDP .67 Single venal bypass from the aorta to the AV-Sulcusbranch.68 After the procedure, the patient has been admittedto the Intensive Care unit.69 Enclosed you can find the operation report.viewpoint of a medical encoder (using ICD-9-CM),and to evaluate the system's responses.For all the 100 sentences, pseudo-HTML code wasgenerated.
The recall was 100 % (all the labels con-cerned were flagged).
The precision ranged from66% to 100 % depending on the label combination.Nevertheless, these figures are temporary as exami-nation of the sentences showed that very few wordshad more than one semantic label so that the medi-cal subselection stage did not have a big impact.
Alarger test set needs to be processed in order to pro-vide more conclusive results.
Probably, recall willdrop while precision could raise.
Nevertheless, theexperience did prove to be valuable as the collabo-rating doctor, who had never heard of NLP before,said he was "positively surprised and impressed" bythe capabilities of the system.
He also judged thetool to be an interesting utility and consented in set-ting up a larger experiment to measure xactly theimpact of the tool on the daily routine of the medicalencoders.
The evaluation procedure of this large testwill be organised to comply as much as possible withthe evaluation criteria recently proposed by Fried-man and Hripcsak (Friedman and Hripcsak, 1997).4 Future  ResearchIn order to demonstrate the full power of the LSP-MLP, the same sentences could be processed bythe joint DMLP/LSP-MLP systems and stored ina RDB table - as is done in other experiments in-volving the LSP system (Hirschman et al, 1981).Specific SQL-queries can then return the ID-numberof the sentence with the relevant information insteadof the information itself.
If the ID-number is addedto the original document as a pseudo-HTML code,the same mechanism as mentioned above can be usedto highlight he sentences containing the relevant in-formation.
Several variants on this base scheme canbe thought of.Following the line of research of Sager (Sager etal., 1995a) and Wingert (Wingert et al, 1989), clas-sification codes could already be generated automat-ically (see also (Lovis et al, 1995)) and presented onthe screen next to the original text.
But the humanencoder would remain responsible for the ultimateselection of the exact codes.Another possibility is the creation of "views" or"masks".
HTML files can be generated with "hardcoded" instructions to emphasise fixed combinationsof semantic labels.
Buttons in the menu-page allowto display very rapidly the selected view on the PDS.Several experiments for English have already beensuccessfully carried out (?)
on the use of "staticWWW-technology".
Interesting as well is the cre-186ation of Document Type Definitions (DTD) that as-sociate a particular layout with a specific semanticlabel (see also (Zweigenbaum et al, 1997)).
TheDTDs can act as a locally defined view (GUI aspect)on common SGML data (NLP aspect).Other potential applications in the medical domainfor the DMLP/LSP-MLP combination are e.g., thedetermination f patient profiles (Borst et al, 1991),quality assurance (Lyman et al, 1991) and extrac-tion of sign/syptom information for medication (Ly-man et al, 198.5).
Overviews of the possible utili-sation in the healthcare area of NLP based systems,irrespective of their theoretical background, can befound in (Baud et al, 1992b) & (Sager et al, 1987,chapter2).But before any application of such an extent canbe envisaged for Dutch, the words of the dictio-nary database all have to receive the appropriatesemantic label(s).
Luckily, this process can be au-tomated.
The LSP-team has implemented such rou-tines (Hirschman et al, 1975) but other techniquescould be applied as well (see (Habert et al, 1996)).From a technical point of view, it would be betterto group all the involved software modules (NLP,RDBMS, WWW) on the same platform to opti-mally exploit he potentialities offered by the combi-nation of the components mentioned.
Ultimately, aclient/server architecture (separating language spe-cific from domain specific issues and the linguisticaspects from user interface aspects) will be the bestarchitecture for a real life application.We can conclude that the application presentedabove shows the feasibility to integrate ElectronicMedical Record (EMR) systems with NLP appli-cations.
This is the kernel message of the DOMEproject (Bouaud et al, 1996) that advocates the useof SGML - and HTML-technology for EMR systems.The above presented WWW-application could thusbe integrated in such a hypertextuM EMR system.ReferencesR.
