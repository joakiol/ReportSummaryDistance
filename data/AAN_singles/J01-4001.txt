Introduction to the Special Issue onComputational Anaphora ResolutionRuslan Mitkov*University of WolverhamptonShalom Lappin*King's College, LondonBranimir Boguraev*IBM T. J. Watson Research CenterAnaphora accounts for cohesion in texts and is a phenomenon under active studyin formal and computational linguistics alike.
The correct interpretation of anaphorais vital for natural anguage processing (NLP).
For example, anaphora resolution isa key task in natural anguage interfaces, machine translation, text summarization,information extraction, question answering, and a number of other NLP applications.After considerable initial research, followed by years of relative silence in the early1980s, anaphora resolution has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last 10years and a great deal of successful work on the topic has been carried out.
Discourse-oriented theories and formalisms uch as Discourse Representation Theory and Cen-tering Theory inspired new research on the computational treatment of anaphora.
Thedrive toward corpus-based robust NLP solutions further stimulated interest in alterna-tive and/or data-enriched approaches.
Last, but not least, application-driven researchin areas uch as automatic abstracting and information extraction i dependently high-lighted the importance of anaphora nd coreference r solution, boosting research inthis area.Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited omain and lin-guistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell andBrown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which requiredconsiderable human input.
However, the pressing need for the development of robustand inexpensive solutions to meet the demands of practical NLP systems encouragedmany researchers tomove away from extensive domain and linguistic knowledge andto embark instead upon knowledge-poor anaphora resolution strategies.
A number ofproposals in the 1990s deliberately imited the extent o which they relied on domainand/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor per-ational environments (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991; Lappin and Leass 1994; Nasukawa1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Williams, Harvey, and Preston 1996; Baldwin 1997;Mitkov 1996, 1998b).The drive toward knowledge-poor and robust approaches was further motivatedby the emergence of cheaper and more reliable corpus-based NLP tools such as part-of-speech taggers and shallow parsers, alongside the increasing availability of corporaand other NLP resources (e.g., ontologies).
In fact, the availability of corpora, both rawand annotated with coreferential links, provided a strong impetus to anaphora resolu-* School of Humanities, Language and Social Sciences, Stafford Street, Wolverhampton WV1 1SB, UK.E-maih r.mitkov@wlv.ac.ukt 30 Saw Mill River Road, Hawthorne, NY 10532, USA.

Corpora (especially when annotated)are an invaluable source not only for empirical research but also for automated learning(e.g., machine learning) methods aiming to develop new rules and approaches; theyalso provide an important resource for evaluation of the implemented approaches.From simple co-occurrence rules (Dagan and Itai 1990) through training decision treesto identify anaphor-antecedent pairs (Aone and Bennett 1995) to genetic algorithms tooptimize the resolution factors (Or~san, Evans, and Mitkov 2000), the successful per-formance of more and more modern approaches was made possible by the availabilityof suitable corpora.While the shift toward knowledge-poor strategies and the use of corpora repre-sented the main trends of anaphora resolution in the 1990s, there are other signifi-cant highlights in recent anaphora resolution research.
The inclusion of the corefer-ence task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6 andMUC-7) gave a considerable impetus to the development of coreference resolutionalgorithms and systems, such as those described in Baldwin et al (1995), Gaizauskasand Humphreys (1996), and Kameyama (1997).
The last decade of the 20th centurysaw a number of anaphora resolution projects for languages other than English such asFrench, German, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish.
Against the backgroundof a growing interest in multilingual NLP, multilingual anaphora/coreference reso-lution has gained considerable momentum in recent years (Aone and McKee 1993;Azzam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998; Harabagiu and Maiorano 2000; Mitkovand Barbu 2000; Mitkov 1999; Mitkov and Stys 1997; Mitkov, Belguith, and Stys 1998).Other milestones of recent research include the deployment of probabilistic and ma-chine learning techniques (Aone and Bennett 1995; Kehler 1997; Ge, Hale, and Char-niak 1998; Cardie and Wagstaff 1999; the continuing interest in centering, used eitherin original or in revised form (Abra~os and Lopes 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahnand Strube 1997; Tetreault 1999); and proposals related to the evaluation methodologyin anaphora resolution (Mitkov 1998a, 2001b).
For a more detailed survey of the stateof the art in anaphora resolution, see Mitkov (forthcoming).The papers published in this issue reflect he major trends in anaphora resolutionin recent years.
Some of them describe approaches that do not exploit full syntacticknowledge (as in the case of Palomar et al's and Stuckardt's work) or that employmachine learning techniques (Soon, Ng, and Lira); others present centering-based pro-noun resolution (Tetreault) or discuss theoretical centering issues (Kibble).
Almost allof the papers feature extensive valuation (including comparative valuation as inthe case of Tetreault's and Palomar et al's work) or discuss general evaluation issues(Byron as well as Stuckardt).Palomar et al's paper describes an approach that works from the output of apartial parser and handles third person personal, demonstrative, reflexive, and zeropronouns, featuring among other things syntactic onditions on Spanish NP-pronounnoncoreference and an enhanced set of resolution preferences.
The authors also im-plement several known methods and compare their performance with that of theirown algorithm.
An indirect conclusion from this work is that an algorithm requiressemantic knowledge in order to hope for a success rate higher than 75%.Soon, Ng, and Lira describe a C5-based learning approach to coreference resolu-tion of noun phrases in unrestricted text.
The approach learns from a small, annotatedcorpus and tackles pronouns, proper names, and definite descriptions.
The coreferenceresolution module is part of a larger coreference resolution system that also includessentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging,noun phrase identification, named entity recognition, and semantic lass determina-tion (via WordNet).
The evaluation is carried out on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 test474Mitkov, Boguraev, and Lappin Anaphora Resolution: Introductioncorpora.
The paper reports on experiments aimed at quantifying the contribution ofeach resolution factor and features error analysis.Stuckardt's work presents an anaphor esolution algorithm for systems where onlypartial syntactic information is available.
Stuckardt applies Government and Bind-ing Theory principles A, B, and C to the task of coreference resolution on partiallyparsed texts.
He also argues that evaluation of anaphora resolution systems houldtake into account several factors beyond simple accuracy of resolution.
In particular,both developer-oriented (e.g., related to the selection of optimal resolution factors)and application-oriented (e.g., related to the requirement of the application, as in thecase of information extraction, where a proper name antecedent is needed) evaluationmetrics should be considered.Tetreault's contribution features comparative valuation involving the author'sown centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centeringalgorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naivealgorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's S-list approach (Strube 1998).
The LRC is an alternative to the original BFP algorithm inthat it processes utterances incrementally.
It works by first searching for an antecedentin the current sentence; if none can be found, it continues the search on the Cf-list ofthe previous and the other preceding utterances in a left-to-right fashion.In her squib, Byron maintains that additional kinds of information should beincluded in an evaluation in order to make the performance of algorithms on pronounresolution more transparent.
In particular, she suggests that the pronoun coverage beexplicitly reported and proposes that the evaluation details be presented in a conciseand compact tabular format called standard isclosure.
Byron also proposes ameasure,the resolution rate, which is computed as the number of pronouns resolved correctlydivided by the number of (only) referential pronouns.Finally, in his squib Kibble discusses a reformulation of the centering transitions(Continue, Retain, and Shift), which specify the center movement across sentences.Instead of defining a total preference ordering, Kibble argues that a partial orderingemerges from the interaction among cohesion (maintaining the same center), salience(realizing the center as subject), and cheapness (realizing the anticipated center of afollowing utterance as subject).The last years have seen considerable advances in the field of anaphora resolution,but a number of outstanding issues either remain unsolved or need more attentionand, as a consequence, represent major challenges to the further development of thefield (Mitkov 2001a).
A fundamental question that needs further investigation is howfar the performance of anaphora resolution algorithms can go and what the limitationsof knowledge-poor methods are.
In particular, more research should be carried out onthe factors influencing the performance of these algorithms.
One of the impedimentsto the evaluation or fuller utilization of machine learning techniques is the lack ofwidely available corpora annotated for anaphoric or coreferential links.
More worktoward the proposal of consistent and comprehensive evaluation is necessary; so toois work in multilingual contexts.
Some of these challenges have been addressed in thepapers published in this issue, but ongoing research will continue to address them inthe near future.ReferencesAbra~os, Jose and Jos6 Lopes.
