First, diverse semantic rolefeatures with regard to different predicatesin a sentence are explored.
Moreover, givena pronominal anaphor, its relative rankingamong all the pronouns in a sentence, ac-cording to relevant semantic role informa-tion and its surface position, is incorporated.In particular, the use of both the semanticrole features and the relative pronominalranking feature in pronoun resolution isguided by extending the centering theoryfrom the grammatical level to the semanticlevel in tracking the local discourse focus.Finally, detailed pronominal subcategoryfeatures are incorporated to enhance thediscriminative power of both the semanticrole features and the relative pronominalranking feature.
Experimental results on theACE 2003 corpus show that the centering-motivated features contribute much to pro-noun resolution.1 IntroductionCoreference accounts for cohesion in a text andis, in a sense, the hyperlink for a natural lan-guage.
Especially, a coreference instance de-notes an identity of reference and holds betweentwo referring expressions, which can be namedentities, definite noun phrases, pronouns and soon.
Coreference resolution is the process of link-ing together multiple referring expressions of agiven entity in the world.
The key in coreferenceresolution is to determine the antecedent foreach referring expression in a text.
The ability oflinking referring expressions both within a sen-tence and across the sentences in a text is criticalto discourse and language understanding in gen-eral.
For example, coreference resolution is akey task in information extraction, machinetranslation, text summarization, and questionanswering.There is a long tradition of research oncoreference resolution within computational lin-guistics.
While earlier knowledge-lean ap-proaches heavily depend on domain andlinguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Carbonelland Brown 1988) and have significantly influ-enced the research, the later approaches usuallyrely on diverse lexical, syntactic and semanticproperties of referring expressions (Soon et al,2001;Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al, 2004).Current research has been focusing on exploitingsemantic information in coreference resolution.For example, Yang et al(2005) proposed a tem-plate-based statistical approach to compute thesemantic compatibility between a pronominalanaphor and an antecedent candidate, and Yangand Su (2007) explored semantic relatednessinformation from automatically discovered pat-terns, while Ng (2007) automatically inducedsemantic class knowledge from a treebank andexplored its application in coreference resolution.Particularly, this paper focuses on the center-ing theory (Sidner,1981;Grosz et al,1995;Tetreault,2001), which reveals the significantimpact of the local focus on referring expres-sions in that the antecedent of a referring expres-sion usually depends on the center of attentionthroughout the local discourse segment (Mit-kov,1998).
Although the centering theory hasbeen considered as a critical theory and the driv-ing force behind the coreferential phenomenasince its proposal, its application in coreferenceresolution (in particular pronoun resolution) hasbeen somewhat disappointing: it fails to improveor even harms the performance of the state-of-987the-art coreference resolution systems in previ-ous research (e.g.
Yang et al 2004).
This may bedue to that centering was originally proposed asa model of discourse coherence instead ofcoreference.The purpose of this paper is to employ thecentering theory in pronoun resolution by ex-tending it from the grammatical level to the se-mantic level.
The intuition behind our approachis that, via determining the semantic roles ofreferring expressions in a sentence, such asagent and patient, we can derive various center-ing theory-motivated features in tracking thecontinuity or shift of the local discourse focus,thus allowing us to include document-levelevent descriptive information in resolving thecoreferential relations between referring expres-sions.To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstresearch, which successfully applies the center-ing theory in pronoun resolution from the se-mantic perspective.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 briefly describes related work in em-ploying the centering theory and semantic in-formation in coreference resolution.
Then, thecentering theory is introduced in Section 3 whileSection 4 details how to employ the centeringtheory from the semantic perspective.
Section 5reports and discusses the experimental results.Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.2 Related WorkThis section briefly overviews the related workin coreference resolution from both the centeringtheory and semantic perspectives.2.1 Centering TheoryIn the literature, there has been much research inthe centering theory and its application tocoreference resolution.In the centering theory itself, since the origi-nal work of Sidner (1979) on immediate focus-ing of pronouns and the subsequent work ofJoshi and Weinstein (1981) on centering andinferences, much research has been done, in-cluding centering and linguistic realizations(Cote 1993; Prince and Walker 1995), empiricaland psycholinguistic evaluation of centeringpredictions (Gordon et al 1993,1995; Brennan1995; Walker et al1998; Kibble 2001), and thecross-linguistic work on centering (Ziv andCrosz1994).In applications of the centering theory tocoreference resolution, representative work in-cludes Brennan et al (1987), Strube (1998),Tetreault (1999) and Yang et al (2004).
Brennanet al (1987) presented a centering theory-basedformalism in modeling the local focus structurein discourse and used it to track the discoursecontext in binding occurring pronouns to corre-sponding entities.
In particular, a BFP (Brennan,Friedman and Pollard) algorithm is proposed toextend the original centering model to includetwo additional transitions called smooth shiftand rough shift.
Strube (1998) proposed an S-listmodel, assuming that a referring expression pre-fers a hearer-old discourse entity to other hearer-new candidates.
Tetreault (1999) further ad-vanced the BFP algorithm by adopting a left-to-right breadth first walk of the syntactic parsetrees to rank the antecedent candidates.
However,the above methods have not been systematicallyevaluated on large annotated corpora, such asMUC and ACE.
Thus their effects are still un-clear in real coreference resolution tasks.
Yanget al(2004) presented a learning-based approachby incorporating several S-list model-based fea-tures to improve the performance in pronounresolution.
It shows that, although including S-list model-based features can slightly boost theperformance in the ideal case (i.e.
given the cor-rect antecedents of anaphor?s candidates), it de-teriorates the overall performance in F-measurewith slightly higher precision but much lowerrecall, in real cases, where the antecedents ofanaphor?s candidates are determined automati-cally by a separate coreference resolution mod-ule.2.2 Semantic InformationIt is well known that semantic information playsa critical role in coreference resolution.
Besidesthe common practice of employing a thesaurus(e.g.
WordNet) in semantic consistency check-ing, much research has been done to explorevarious kinds of semantic information, such assemantic similarity (Harabagiu et al2000), se-mantic compatibility (Yang et al2005, 2007),and semantic class information (Soon et al2001;Ng 2007).
Although these methods have beenproven useful in coreference resolution, theircontributions are much limited.
For example, Ng(2007) showed that semantic similarity informa-tion and semantic agreement information couldonly improve the performance of coreferenceresolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respec-tively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus.9883 Centering TheoryThe centering theory is a theory about the localdiscourse structure that models the interaction ofreferential continuity and the salience of dis-course entities in the internal organization of atext.
In natural languages, a given entity may bereferred by different expressions and act as dif-ferent grammatical roles throughout a text.
Forexample, people often use pronouns to refer tothe main subject of the discourse in focus, whichcan change over different portions of the dis-course.
One main goal of the centering theory isto track the focus entities throughout a text.The main claims of the centering theory canbe formalized in terms of Cb (the backward-looking center), Cf (a list of forward-lookingcenters for each utterance Un) and Cp (the pre-ferred center, i.e.
the most salient candidate forsubsequent utterances).
Given following twosentences: 1) Susani gave Betsyj a pet hamsterk;2) Shei reminded herj that such hamstersk werequite shy.
We can have Ub, Uf and Up as follows:Ub= ?Susan?
; Uf={?Susan?, ?Betsy?, ?a pethamster?
}; Up= ?Susan?.Cb(Un)=Cb(Un-1)  or Cb(Un-1) undefinedCb(Un)?Cb(Un-1)Cb(Un)=Cp(Un) Continue Smooth ShiftCb(Un)?Cp(Un) Retain Rough ShiftTable 1: Transitions in the centering theoryConstraintsC1.
There is precisely one Cb.C2.
Every element of Cf(Un) must be realized in Un.C3.
Cb(Un) is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Un-1)that is realized in Un.RulesR1.
If some element of Cf(Un-1) is realized as a pro-noun in Un, then so is Cb(Un).R2.Transitions have the descending preference orderof ?Continue > Retain > Smooth Shift > RoughShift?.Table 2: Constraints and rules in the centering theoryFurthermore, several kinds of focus transi-tions are defined in terms of two tests: whetherCb stays the same (i.e.
Cb(Un+1)=Cb(Un)), andwhether Cb is realized as the most prominentreferring expression (i.e.
Cb(Un=Cp(Un)).
Werefer to the first test as cohesion, and the secondtest as salience.
Therefore, there are four possi-ble combinations, which are displayed in Table1 and can result in four kinds of transitions,namely Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, andRough Shift.
Obviously, salience, which choosesa proper verb form to make Cb prominent withina clause or sentence, is an important matter forsentence planning, while cohesion, which orderspropositions in a text to maintain referential con-tinuity, is an important matter for text planning.Finally, the centering theory imposes severalconstraints and rules over Cb/Cf and above tran-sitions, as shown in Table 2.Given the centering theory as described above,we can draw the following conclusions:1) The centering theory is discourse-related andcenters are discourse constructs.2) The backward-looking center Cb of Un de-pends only on the expressions that constitutethe utterance.
That is, it is independent of itssurface position and grammatical roles.Moreover, it is not constrained by any previ-ous utterance in the segment.
While the ele-ments of Cf(Un) are partially ordered toreflect relative prominence in Un, grammati-cal role information is often a major determi-nant in ranking Cf, e.g.
in the descendingpriority order of ?Subject > Object > Others?in English (Grosz and Joshi, 2001).3) Psychological research (Gordon et al 1993)and cross-linguistic research (Kameyama1986, 1988; Walker et al 1990,1994) havevalidated that Cb is preferentially realized bya pronoun in English.4) Frequent rough shifts would lead to a lack oflocal cohesion.
To keep local cohesion, peo-ple tend to plan ahead and minimize thenumber of focus shifts.In this paper, we extend the centering theoryfrom the grammatical level to the semantic levelin attempt to better model the continuity or shiftin the local discourse focus and improve the per-formance of pronoun resolution via centering-motivated semantic role features.4 Employing Centering Theory fromSemantic PerspectiveIn this section, we discuss how to employ thecentering theory in pronoun resolution from thesemantic perspective.
In Subsection 4.1, we in-troduce the semantic roles.
In Subsection 4.2, weintroduce how to employ the centering theory inpronoun resolution via semantic role features.Finally we compare our method with the previ-ous work in Subsection 4.3.4.1 Semantic RoleA semantic role is the underlying relationshipthat a participant has with a given predicate in aclause, i.e.
the actual role a participant plays in989an event, apart from linguistic encoding of thesituation.
If, in some situation, someone named?John?
purposely hits someone named ?Bill?,then ?John?
is the agent and ?Bill?
is the patientof the hitting event.
Therefore, given the predi-cate ?hit?
in both of the following sentences,?John?
has the same semantic role of agent and?Bill?
has the same semantic role of patient: 1)John hit Bill.
2) Bill was hit by John.In the literature, labeling of such semanticroles has been well defined by the SRL (Seman-tic Role Labeling) task, which first identifies thearguments of a given predicate and then assignsthem appropriate semantic roles.
During the lastfew years, there has been growing interest inSRL.
For example, CoNLL 2004 and 2005 havemade this problem a well-known shared task.However, there is still little consensus in the lin-guistic and NLP communities about what set ofsemantic role labels are most appropriate.
Typi-cal semantic roles include core roles, such asagent, patient, instrument, and adjunct roles(such as locative, temporal, manner, and cause).For core roles, only agent and patient are consis-tently defined across different predicates, e.g.
inthe popular PropBank (Palmer et al 2005) andthe derived version evaluated in the CoNLL2004 and 2005 shared tasks, as ARG0 andARG1.In this paper, we extend the centering theoryfrom the grammatical level to the semantic levelfor its better application in pronoun resolutionvia proper semantic role features due to threereasons:Sentence Grammatical Role Semantic RoleBob opened thedoor with a key.Bob:SUBJECTBob:AGENTThe key openedthe door.The key:SUBJECTThe key :INSTRUMENTThe door opened.
The door:SUBJECTThe door:PATIENTTable 3: Relationship between grammatical roles andsemantic roles: an example1) Semantic roles are conceptual notions,whereas grammatical roles are morph-syntactic.
While the original centering theorymainly builds from the grammatical perspec-tive and grammatical roles do not always cor-respond directly to semantic roles (Table 3shows an example of various semantic roleswhich a subject can play), there is a close re-lationship between semantic roles and gram-matical roles.
The statistics in the CoNLL2004 and 2005 shared tasks (Shen and Lapata,2007) shows that the semantic roles ofARG0/agent and ARG1/patient account for85% of all arguments and most likely act asthe centers of the local focus structure in dis-course due to the close relationship betweensubject/object and agent/patient.
Therefore, itis appropriate to model the centers of an ut-terance from the semantic perspective viasemantic roles.2) In a sense, semantic roles imply the informa-tion of grammatical roles, especially for sub-ject/object.
For example, the position of anargument and the voice of the predicate verbplay a central role in SRL.
In intuition, an ar-gument, which occurs before an active verband has the semantic role of Arg0/agent,tends to be a subject.
That is to say, semanticroles (e.g.
Arg0/agent and Arg1/patient) canbe mapped into their corresponding gram-matical roles (e.g.
subject and object), usingsome heuristic rules.
Therefore, it would beinteresting to represent the centers of the ut-terances and employ the centering theoryfrom the semantic perspective.3) Semantic role labeling has been well studiedin the literature and there are good ready-to-use toolkits available.
For example, Pradhan(2005) achieved 82.2 in F-measure on theCoNLL 2005 version of the Propbank.
Incontrast, the research on grammatical role la-beling is much less with the much lowerstate-of-the-art performance of 71.2 in F-measure (Buchholz, 1999).
Therefore, it maybe better to explore the centering theory fromthe semantic perspective.4.2 Designing Centering-motivated Fea-tures from  Semantic PerspectiveIn this paper, the centering theory is employed inpronoun resolution via three kinds of centering-motivated features:1) Semantic role features.
They are achieved bychecking possible semantic roles of referringexpressions with regard to various predicatesin a sentence.
Due to the close relationshipbetween subject/object and agent/patient, se-mantic role information should be also a ma-jor determinant in deciding the center of anutterance, which is likely to be the antecedentof a referring expression in the descendingpriority order of ?Agent > Patient > Others?with regard to their semantic roles, corre-sponding to the descending priority order of?Subject > Object > Others?
with regard totheir grammatical roles.9902) Relative pronominal ranking feature.
Due tothe predominance of pronouns in tracking thelocal discourse structure1, the relative rank-ing of a pronoun among all the pronouns in asentence should be useful in pronoun resolu-tion.
This is realized in this paper accordingto its semantic roles (with regard to variouspredicates in a sentence) and surface position(in a left-to-right order) by mapping eachpronoun into 5 levels: a) rank 1 for pronounswith semantic role ARG0/agent of the mainpredicate; b) rank 2 for pronouns with seman-tic role ARG1/patient of the main predicate; c)rank 3 for pronouns with semantic roleARG0/agent of other predicates; d) rank 4 forpronouns with semantic role ARG1/patient ofother predicates; e) rank 5 for remaining pro-nouns.
Furthermore, for those pronouns withthe same ranking level, they are ordered ac-cording to their surface positions in a left-to-right order, motivated by previous researchon the centering theory (Grosz et al 1995).3) Detailed pronominal subcategory features.Given a pronominal expression, its detailedpronominal subcategory features, such aswhether it is a first person pronoun, secondperson pronoun, third person pronoun, neuterpronoun or others, are explored to enhancethe discriminative power of both the semanticrole features and the relative pronominalranking feature, considering the predominantimportance of pronouns in tracking the localfocus structure in discourse.4.3 Comparison with Previous WorkAs a representative in explicitly employing se-mantic role labeling in coreference resolution,Ponzetto and Strube (2006) explored two seman-tic role features to capture the predicate-argument structure information to benefitcoreference resolution: I_SEMROLE, the predi-cate-argument pairs of one referring expression,and J_SEMROLE, the predicate-argument pairsof another referring expression.
Their experi-ments on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that,while the two semantic role features much im-prove the performance of common noun resolu-tion by 3.8 and 2.7 in F-measure on the BNEWSand NWIRE domains respectively, they only1 According to the centering theory, the backward-lookingcenter Cb is preferentially realized by a pronoun in the sub-ject position in natural languages, such as English, andpeople tend to plan ahead and minimize the number offocus shifts.slightly improve the performance of pronounresolution by 0.4 and 0.3 in F-measure on theBNEWS and NWIRE domains respectively.In comparison, this paper proposes variouskinds of centering-motivated semantic role fea-tures in attempt to better model the continuity orshift in the local discourse focus by extendingthe centering theory from the grammatical levelto the semantic level.
For example, theCAARG0MainVerb feature (as shown in Table5) is designed to capture the semantic role of theantecedent candidate in the main predicate inmodeling the discourse center, while, the AN-PronounRanking feature (as shown in Table 5) isdesigned to determinate the relative priority ofthe pronominal anaphor in retaining the dis-course center.Although both this paper and Ponzetto andStrube (2006) employs semantic role features,their ways of deriving such features are muchdifferent due to different drivingforces/motivations behind.
As a result, their con-tributions on coreference resolution are different:while the semantic role features in Ponzette andStrube (2006) captures the predicate-argumentstructure information and contributes much tocommon noun resolution and their contributionon pronoun resolution can be ignored, the cen-tering-motivated semantic role features in thispaper contribute much in pronoun resolution.This justifies our attempt to better model thecontinuity or shift of the discourse focus in pro-noun resolution by extending the centering the-ory from the grammatical level to the semanticlevel and employing the centering-motivatedfeatures in pronoun resolution..5 Experimentation and DiscussionWe have evaluated our approach of employingthe centering theory in pronoun resolution fromthe semantic perspective on the ACE 2003 cor-pus.5.1 Experimental SettingThe ACE 2003 corpus contains three domains:newswire (NWIRE), newspaper (NPAPER), andbroadcast news (BNEWS).
For each domain,there exist two data sets, training and devtest,which are used for training and testing respec-tively.
Table 4 lists the pronoun distributionswith coreferential relationships in the trainingdata and the test data over pronominal subcate-gories and sentence distances.
Table 4(a) showsthat third person pronouns occupy most and neu-991tral pronouns occupy second while Table 4(b)shows that the antecedents of most pronounsoccur within the current sentence and the previ-ous sentence, with a little exception in the testdata set of BNEWS.NWIRE NPAPER BNEWSPronounSubcategory Train Test Train Test Train TestFirst Person 263 103 283 120 455 258Second Person 61 16 29 36 203 68Third Person 618 179 919 263 736 158Neuter 395 151 577 190 482 137Reflexive 23 6 42 12 26 6Other 0 0 2 0 2 3(a) Distribution over pronominal subcategoriesNWIRE NPAPER BNEWSDistanceTrain Test Train Test Train Test0 890 254 1281 347 1149 2951 447 149 529 197 729 1882 0 27 0 24 0 41>2 0 19 0 41 0 100Total 1337 449 1810 609 1878 624(b) Distribution over sentence distancesTable 4: Pronoun statistics on the ACE 2003 corpusFor preparation, all the documents in the cor-pus are preprocessed automatically using a pipe-line of NLP components, including tokenizationand sentence segmentation, named entity recog-nition, part-of-speech tagging and noun phrasechunking.
Among them, named entity recogni-tion, part-of-speech tagging and noun phrasechunking apply the same Hidden Markov Model(HMM)-based engine with error-driven learningcapability (Zhou and Su, 2000 & 2002).
In par-ticular for SRL, we use a state-of-the-art in-house toolkit, which achieved the precision of87.07% for ARG0 identification and the preci-sion of 78.97% for ARG1 identification, for easyintegration.
In addition, we use the SVM-light2toolkit with the radial basis kernel and defaultlearning parameters.
Finally, we report the per-formance in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure, where precision measures the percent-age of correctly-resolved pronouns (i.e.
correctlylinked with any referring expression in thecoreferential chain), recall measures the cover-age of correctly-resolved pronouns, and F-measure gives an overall figure on equal har-mony between precision and recall.
To seewhether an improvement is significant, we alsoconduct significance testing using paired t-test.In this paper, ?>>>?, ?>>?
and ?>?
denote p-values of an improvement smaller than 0.01, in-between (0.01, 0,05] and bigger than 0.05,2 http://svmlight.joachims.org/which mean significantly better, moderatelybetter and slightly better, respectively.5.2 Experimental ResultsTable 5 details various centering-motivated fea-tures from the semantic perspective, which areincorporated in our final system.
For example,the CAARG0MainVerb feature is designed tocapture the semantic role of the antecedent can-didate in the main predicate in modeling the dis-course center, while the ANPronounRankingfeature is designed to determinate the relativepriority of the pronominal anaphor in retainingthe discourse center.
As the baseline, we dupli-cated the representative system with the same setof 12 basic features, as described in Soon et al(2001).
Table 6 shows that our baseline systemachieves the state-of-the-art performance of 62.3,65.3 and 59.0 in F-measure on the NWIRE,NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively.
Italso shows that the centering-motivated features(from the semantic perspective) significantlyimprove the F-measure by 3.6(>>>), 4.5(>>>)and 7.7(>>>) on the NWIRE, NPAPER andBNEWS domains, respectively.
This justifiesour attempt to model the continuity or shift ofthe discourse focus in pronoun resolution viacentering-motivated features from the semanticperspective.
For comparison, we also evaluatethe performance of our final system from thegrammatical perspective.
This is done by replac-ing semantic roles with grammatical roles inderiving centering-motivated features.
Here, la-beling of grammatical roles is achieved using astate-of-the-art toolkit, as described in Buchholz(1999).
Table 6 shows that properly employingthe centering theory in pronoun resolution fromthe grammatical perspective can also improvethe performance.
However, the performance im-provement of employing the centering theoryfrom the grammatical perspective is much lower,compared with that from the semantic perspec-tive.
This validates our attempt of employing thecentering theory in pronoun resolution from thesemantic perspective instead of from the gram-matical perspective.
This also suggests the greatpotential of applying the centering theory inpronoun resolution since the centering theory isa local coherence theory, which tells how subse-quent utterances in a text link together.Table 7 shows the contribution of the seman-tic role features and the relative pronominalranking feature in pronoun resolution when thedetailed pronominal subcategory features areincluded:992Feature category Feature RemarksCAARG0 1 if the semantic role of the antecedent candidate is ARG0/agent; else 0CAARG0MainVerb 1 if the antecedent candidate has the semantic role of ARG0/agent for the main predicate of the sentence; else 0Semantic Role-based  Fea-turesANCASameTarget 1 if the anaphor and the antecedent candidate share the same predicate with regard to their semantic roles; else 0Relative Pronominal Rank-ing Feature ANPronounRankingWhether the pronominal anaphor is ranked highest among allthe pronouns in the sentenceANPronounType Whether the anaphor is a first person, second person, third person, neuter pronoun or others Detailed Pronominal Sub-category FeaturesCAPronounType Whether the antecedent candidate is a first person, second person, third person, neuter pronoun or othersTable 5: Centering-motivated features incorporated in our final system(with AN indicating the anaphor and CA indicating the antecedent candidate)NWIRE NPAPER BNEWS System VariationR% P% F R% P% F R% P% FBaseline System 57.0 68.6 62.3 61.1 70.1 65.3 49.0 73.9 59.0Final System(from the semantic perspective)64.1 67.8 65.9 67.5 72.4 69.8 59.9 75.3 66.7Final System(from the grammatical perspective, for comparison)63.3 64 63.6 64.7 68.8 66.7 57.1 70.1 63.1Table 6: Contributions of centering-motivated features in pronoun resolutionNWIRE NPAPER BNEWS System VariationR% P% F R% P% F R% P% FBaseline System 57.0 68.6 62.3 61.1 70.1 65.3 49.0 73.9 59.0+SR and DC 64.8 67.8 66.3 67.2 72.9 69.9 59.1 75.3 66.3+PR and DC 61.5 65.4 63.4 64.9 72.1 68.3 57.4 73.5 64.5+SR, PR and DC (Final System) 64.1 67.8 65.9 67.5 72.4 69.8 59.9 75.3 66.7Table 7: Contribution of the semantic role features (SR) and the relative pronominal ranking feature (PR) in pro-noun resolution when the detailed pronominal subcategory features are included1) The inclusion of the semantic role featuresimprove the performance by 4.0(>>>),4.6(>>>) and 7.3(>>>) in F-measure on theNWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, re-spectively.
This suggests the impact of se-mantic role information in determining thelocal discourse focus.
Since pronouns prefer-entially occur in the subject position and tendto refer to the main subject (Ehrlich 1980;Brennan 1995; Walker et al 1998; Cahn1995; Gordon and Searce 1995; Kibble et al2001), this paper only applies semantic fea-tures related with the semantic role ofARG0/agent, which is closely related withthe grammatical role of subject, with regardto various predicates in a sentence.
We havealso explored features related with other se-mantic roles.
However, our preliminary ex-perimentation shows that they do not improvethe performance, even for ARG1/patient, andthus are not included in the final system.
Thismay be due to that other semantic roles arenot discriminative enough to make a differ-ence in deciding the local discourse structure.2) It is surprising to notice that further inclusionof the relative pronominal ranking feature hasonly slight impact (slight positive impact onthe BNEWS domain and slight negative im-pact on the NWIRE and NPAPER domains)on the ACE 2003 corpus.
This suggests thatmost of information in the relative pronomi-nal ranking feature has been covered by thesemantic role features.
This is not surprisingsince the semantic role of ARG0/agent,which is explored to derive the semantic rolefeatures, is also applied to decide the relativepronominal ranking feature.The inclusion of the relative pronominalranking feature improve the performance by1.1(>>>), 3.0(>>>) and 5.5(>>>) in F-measure.Our further evaluation reveals that the perform-ance improvement difference among differentdomains of the ACE 2003 corpus is due to thedistribution of pronouns?
antecedents occurringover different sentence distances, as shown in993Table 4.
This suggests the usefulness of the rela-tive pronominal ranking feature in resolvingpronominal anaphors over longer distance.
Thisis consistent with our observation that, as thepercentage of pronominal anaphors referring tomore distant antecedents increase, its impactturns gradually from negative to positive, whenfurther including the relative pronominal rankingfeature after the semantic role features.
The rea-son that we include the detailed pronominal sub-category information is due to predominantimportance of pronouns in tracking the localfocus structure in discourse and that such de-tailed pronominal subcategory information isdiscriminative in tracking different subcatego-ries of pronouns.
This suggests the usefulness ofconsidering the distribution of the local dis-course focus over detailed pronominal subcate-gories.
One interesting finding in ourpreliminary experimentation is that the inclusionof the detailed pronominal subcategory featuresalone even harms the performance.
This may bedue to the reason that the detailed pronominalsubcategory features do not have the discrimina-tive power themselves and that the semantic rolefeatures and the relative pronominal ranking fea-ture provide an effective mechanism to explorethe role of such detailed pronominal subcategoryfeatures in helping determine the local discoursefocus.PronounSubcategoryNWIRE NPAPER BNEWSFirst Person 55.7 55.9 56.6Second Person 54.6 60.4 44.0Third Person 72.6 80.9 75.7Neuter 41.5 50.4 50.2Reflexive 85.7 70.0 60.0BaselineSystemTotal 62.3 65.3 59.0First Person 64.7 67.0 65.6Second Person 78.6 70.0 51.9Third Person 80.9 81.8 80.4Neuter 48.3 53.0 58.3Reflexive 71.4 66.7 80.0 Final SystemTotal 65.9 69.8 66.7Table 8: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu-tion in F-measure over pronoun subcategoriesTable 8 shows the contribution of the center-ing-motivated features over different pronounsubcategories.

In particular, the centering-motivated features improve the performance onthe major three pronoun subcategories of thirdperson / neuter / first person, by8.3(>>>)/6.8(>>>)/9.0(>>>), 0.9(>>)/ 2.6(>>>)/11.1(>>>) and 4.7(>>>)/8.1(>>>)/9.0(>>>), on the NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWSdomains of the ACE 2003 corpus, respectively.Distance NWIRE NPAPER BNEWS<=0 61.6 64.5 68.7<=1 60.4 67.5 60.0<=2 62.9 67.4 63.7BaselineSystemTotal 62.3 65.3 59.0<=0 64.3 70.3 78.7<=1 66.8 72.3 72.5<=2 66.6 71.8 71.8Final Sys-temTotal 65.9 69.8 66.7Table 9: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu-tion in F-measure over sentence distancesTable 9 shows the contribution of the center-ing-motivated features over different sentencedistances.
It shows that the centering-motivatedfeatures improve the performance of pronounresolution on different sentence distances of0/1/2, by 2.7(>>>) / 5.8(>>>) / 10.0 (>>>),6.4(>>>) / 4.8(>>>) / 12.5(>>>) and 3.7(>>>)/4.4(>>>)/8.1(>>>), on the NWIRE,NPAPER and BNEWS domains of the ACE2003 corpus, respectively.
This suggests that thecentering-motivated features are helpful for bothintra-sentential and inter-sentential pronounresolution.6 Conclusion and Further WorkThis paper extends the centering theory from thegrammatical level to the semantic level andmuch improves the performance of pronounresolution via centering-motivated features fromthe semantic perspective.
This is mainly realizedby employing various semantic role featureswith regard to various predicates in a sentence,in attempt to model the continuity or shift of thelocal discourse focus.
Moreover, the relativeranking feature of a pronoun among all the pro-nouns is explored to help determine the relativepriority of the pronominal anaphor in retainingthe local discourse focus.
Evaluation on theACE 2003 corpus shows that both the centering-motivated semantic role features and pronominalranking feature much improve the performanceof pronoun resolution, especially when the de-tailed pronominal subcategory features of boththe anaphor and the antecedent candidate areincluded.
It is not surprising due to the predomi-994nance of pronouns in tracking the local discoursestructure in a text.To our best knowledge, this paper is the firstresearch which successfully applies the center-ing-motivated features in pronoun resolutionfrom the semantic perspective.For future work, we will explore more kindsof semantic information and structured syntacticinformation in pronoun resolution.
In particular,we will further employ the centering theory inpronoun resolution from both grammatical andsemantic perspectives on more corpora.AcknowledgementThis research is supported by Project 60673041under the National Natural Science Foundationof  China, project 2006AA01Z147 under the?863?
