MNCwill be a sentence level annotated corpus.The validity of XML tag set has beentested by manually tagging the sample data.Keywords: Corpus, XML, Myanmar,Myanmar Languages1 IntroductionMyanmar (formerly known as Burma) is one of theSouth-East Asian countries.
There are 135 ethnicgroups living in Myanmar.
These ethnic groupsspeak more than one language and use differentscripts to present their respective languages.
Thereare a total of 109 languages spoken by the peopleliving in Myanmar [Ethnologue, 2005].There are seven major languages, according tothe speaking population in Myanmar.
They areKachin, Kayin/Karen, Chin, Mon, Burmese,Rakhine and Shan [Ko Ko & Mikami, 2005].Among them, Burmese is the official language andspoken by about 69% of the population as theirmother tongue [Ministry of Immigration andPopulation, 1995].Corpus is a large and structured set of texts.They are used to do statistical analysis, checkingoccurrences or validating linguistic rules on aspecific universe.1In Myanmar, there are a plenty of text for mostof the languages, especially Burmese and majorlanguages, since stone inscription.1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpusMyanmar Language Commission and a numberof scholars had been collected a number of corporafor their specific uses [Htay et al, 2006].
But thereis no national corpus collection, both in digital andnon-digital format, until now.Since there are a number of languages used inMyanmar, the national level corpus to be built willinclude all languages and scripts used in Myanmar.It has been named as Myanmar National Corpus orMNC, in short form.During the discussion for the selection offormat for the corpus, XML (eXtensible MarkupLanguage), a subset of SGML (StandardGeneralized Markup Language), format has beenchosen since XML format can be a long usable andpossible to keep the original format of the text[Burnard.
1996].
The range of software availablefor XML is increasing day by day.
Certainly moreand more NLP related tools and resources areproduced in it.
This in turn makes the necessity ofselection of XML tag set to start building of MNC.MNC will include not only written text but alsospoken texts.
The part of written text will includeregional and national newspapers and periodicals,journals and interests, academic books, fictions,memoranda, essays, etc.
The part of spoken textwill include scripted formal and informalconversations, movies, etc.During the selection of XML tag sets, thesample for all the data which will be included inbuilding of MNC, has been learnt.2 Myanmar National CorpusMyanmar is a country of using 109 differentlanguages and a number of different scripts[Ethnologue, 2005].
In order to do languageprocessing for these languages and scripts, itbecomes a necessity to build a corpus withThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200833languages and scripts used in Myanmar; at leastwith major languages and scripts, which willinclude almost all areas of documents.Among the different scripts used in Myanmar,the popular scripts include Burmese script (aBrahmi based script), Latin scripts.
Building ofMNC will be helpful for development of NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) tools (such asgrammar rules, spelling checking, etc) and also forlinguistic research on these languages and scripts.Moreover, since Burmese script is written withoutnecessarily pausing between words with spaces,the corpus to be built is hoped to be useful fordeveloping tools for automatic word segmentation.2.1 XML based corpusXML is universal format for structured documentsand data, and can provide highly standardizedrepresentation frameworks for NLP (Jin-DongKIM et al 2001); especially, the ones withannotated corpus based approaches, by providingthem with the knowledge representationframeworks for morphological, syntactic,semantics and/or pragmatics information structure.Important features are:?
XML is extensible and it does not consistof a fixed set of tags.?
XML documents must be well-formedaccording to a defined syntax.?
XML document can be formally validatedagainst a schema of some kind.?
XML is more interested in the meaning ofdata than its presentation.The XML documents must have exactly onetop-level element or root element.
All otherelements must be nested within it.
Elements mustbe properly nested [Young, 2001].
That is, if anelement starts within another element, it must alsoend within that same element.Each element must have both a start-tag and anend-tag.
The element type name in a start-tag mustexactly match the name in the corresponding end-tag and element name are case sensitive.Moreover, the advantages of XML for NLPincludes ontology extraction into XML basedstructured languages using XML Schema.
Thegreat benefit about XML is that the document itselfdescribes the structure of data.
2Three characteristics of XML distinguish fromother markup languages:3?
its emphasis on descriptive rather thanprocedural markup;?
its notion of documents as instances of adocument type and?
its independence of any hardware orsoftware system.Since MNC is to be built in XML based format,the selection process for tag set of XML becomean important process.
The XML tagged corpus datashould also keep the original format of the data.In order to select XML tag set for MNC, thesample data for the corpus has to be collected.
Theformat of the sample corpus data has been studiedfor the selection of the XML tag set in appropriatewith the data format.2.2 Structure of a data file at MNCThe structure of a data file at MNC will includetwo main parts:  information of the corpus file andthe corpus data.The first part, the header part of a corpus file,describes the information of a corpus file.
Theinformation of the corpus file includes the headerwhich will provide sensible use of the corpusinformation in machine readable form.
In this part,the information such as language usage and thedescription of the corpus file will be included.The second part, the document part, of a corpusfile will include the source description of thecorpus data and the corpus data, the written orspoken part of the text, itself.
The information ofthe corpus data such as bibliographic information,authorship, and publisher information will beincluded in this section.
Moreover, the corpus dataitself will also be included in this section.The hierarchically structure of a corpus file atMNC will be as shown in figure 1.2 http://www.tei-c.org/P5/Guidelines/index.html3 http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200834Figure 1.
Hierarchically structure of a data file at MNC3 Selection of necessary XML tag setAfter studying original formats and features oftexts, to be used in corpus, and the structure ofthe corpus file has been determined, theselection procedure for XML tag set has beenstarted.British National Corpus (BNC)4, AmericanNational Corpus (ANC)5 had been referencedfor selection of XML tag set.The selection of XML tag set is based on thenature of the structure of a data file.
The maintag for the data file will be named as <mnc>which is the abbreviation of Myanmar NationalCorpus.A data file contains two main parts, theheader part and the document part.-<mnc>+<teiHeader></teiHeader>+<myaDoc></myaDoc></mnc>Figure 2.

Sample MNC Corpus file (Burmese UDHR text in MNC XML format)4 Conclusion and Future workIn this paper, the authors have clearly describedabout the selection of XML tag set for buildingof MNC.
Since the word level segmentation forBurmese script is not yet available, the corpusdata will be annotated only up to the sentencelevel in order to be in the same format for allMyanmar languages and scripts.In order to check whether the selected theXML tag set will be enough and useful fortagging the corpus data, the sample corpus datahas been collected by manually tagging the datawhich includes newspapers and periodicals,Universal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR), novels and essays.Since the manual tagging to the samplecorpus data proves that the selected XML tag setis enough to cover a variety of data sources, thenext step is to develop an algorithm forautomatic tagging the data.AcknowledgementThis study was performed with the support ofthe Government of the Union of Myanmarthrough Myanmar Natural LanguageImplementation Committee.
