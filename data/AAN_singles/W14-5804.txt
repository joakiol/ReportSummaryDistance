As a consequence, terms becomesunambiguous and clear, and at last, being useful for conceptualizations, are used as a starting point forformalizations.
Sowa (2000) notes that ?most fields of science, engineering, business, and law haveevolved systems of terminology or nomenclature for naming, classifying, and standardizing theirconcepts?.
As well, Parts Of Speech (POS) present two levels of representation, which are separatedbut interlinked: a conceptual-semantic level, pertaining to ontologies, and a syntactic-semantic level,pertaining to sentence production.
Starting from an analysis of problems in existing dictionaries, inthis paper we present formalized Italian Linguistic Resources (LRs) for the Archaeological domain, inwhich we integrate/couple formal ontology classes and properties into/to electronic dictionary entries,using a standardized conceptual reference model.
We also add Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)references in order to guarantee the interoperability between linguistic and language resources, andtherefore to represent knowledge.2 Related WorksDifferent models/mechanisms have been developed to overcome knowledge representation issuesderiving from increasing complexity and diversity of linguistic resources.WordNet, one of the most widespread resource, is based on is-a, part-of and member-of relationsbetween synsets, which are  used to represent concepts.
At any rate, WordNet relations are not used ina consistent way, inasmuch sometimes they are broken or present redundancy (Martin, 2003).Rule based systems are usually founded on logical rules (Bender, 1996) and fuzzy rules (Zadeh,1965, 2004; Surmann, 2000).Generally speaking, the ontology-based approach deals with knowledge representation issuesprocessing a set of words and their semantic relations in a certain domain (Gruber, 1993; Cocchiarella,1996; Brewster et al., 2004; Tijerino et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2010; Hao, 2010; Wang et al., 2011).We intend to develop a linguistic knowledge base, i.e.
a lexical database, in which the ontologyschema will be integrated to process language on the basis of syntactic relations, i.e.
formal grammars.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

LG was set up by the French linguist Maurice Gross, duringthe ?60s, and subsequently applied to Italian by Annibale Elia, Maurizio Martinelli and EmilioD'Agostino.
All electronic dictionaries, built according to LG descriptive method, form the DELA1System, which works as a linguistic engine embedded in automatic textual analysis software systemsand parsers2.
Our LRs also include information taken from the Thesauri and Guidelines of the ItalianCentral Institute for the Catalogue and Documentation (ICCD)3.ICCD resources are organized in:?
Object definition dictionary?
Marble sculptures?
Metal containers?
Marble sculptures ?
Sarcophagi and reliefs?
Vocabulary of Metals?
Vocabulary of  Glasses?
Vocabulary of Materials?
Vocabulary of Mosaic Pavement Works?
Vocabulary of non-figurative mosaics?
Vocabulary of Mosaics?
Vocabulary of Coroplastics.Only the Object definition dictionary provides, for each entry, the following different and structuredinformation: Broader Term [BT], Broader Term Partitive [BTP1], Broader Term Partitive [BTP2],Narrower Term [NT], Narrower Term Partitive [NTP], Use [USE], Use For [UF].BT BTP1 BTP2 NT NTP USE UFamuleto  StrumentiUtensili eoggetti d'usoAmuleti eoggetti perusocerimoniale,magico evotivoa forma di anatraa forma di arietea forma di colonna...cornettoTable 1.
An example of lemma categorization from ICCD dictionaryBroader term fields indicate the taxonomy classification, so amuleto (amulet) is an element ofStrumenti, Utensili e Oggetti d'uso (Tools), which is a general category, and Amuleti e oggetti per usocerimoniale, magico e votivo (Magic & Votive Supplies), which is a specific category.The NTP field specifies the lemma, and this helps us to infer that amuleto occurs in differentcompound entries, for instance: amuleto a forma di anatra (duck amulet), amuleto a forma di ariete(ram amulet) and so on.
UF is a no-preferential lemma (i.e.
a variant); this implies that cornetto (hornamulet) can stand for amuleto (and its specific types), but ICCD guidelines suggest to use the first one.According to our approach, it is necessary to lemmatize all possible variants, including those havingeven a low-frequency use.Our electronic dictionary4, which represents an additional resource to the ICCD ones listed above, iscomposed by ca.
11000 entries, with both simple and compound words, including spelling variants,i.e.
: (dinos+dynos+d?inos) con anse ad anello (ringed-handle (dinos+dynos+d?inos)), and synonyms,generally extracted from the UF field, i.e.
kylix a labbro risparmiato (spared-lip kylix), which standsfor lip cup or cratere (crater)which stands for vaso (vase).1Dictionnaires ?lectroniques du LADL (Laboratoire d'Automatique Documentaire et Linguistique).2DELA electronic dictionaries are of two types: of simple words and of Multi-Word Expressions (MWE).3http://www.iccd.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/240/vocabolari.4In 4 we give an excerpt of the Italian Archaeological Electronic Dictionary.25Besides, our additional resource has been created extracting terms from existing literature.
Also,from ICCD unstructured data (i.e.
the vocabulary of Coroplastics) Proper and Place Names have beenretrieved, which are now entries of our dictionary.3.1 Formal, syntactic and semantic featuresThe main formal structures recorded in our electronic dictionary are:?
Noun+Preposition+Noun+Preposition+Noun (NPNPN), i.e.
fibula ad arco a coste (ribbed-arch fibula);?
Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective (NPNA), i.e.
anello a capi ritorti (twisted-heads ring);?
Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective+Adjective (NPNAA), i.e.
punta a foglia larga ovale(oval broadleaf point).We also notice the presence of open series compounds.
Open series compounds are multi-words inwhich we can identify one or more fixed elements co-occurring with one or more variable ones, i.e.palmetta a (cinque+sei+sette+DNUM) petali (little plam with (five+six+seven+DNUM) petals).As for semantics, we observe the presence of compounds in which the head does not occur in thefirst position; for instance, the open series frammenti di (terracotta+anfora+laterizi+N) (fragments of(clay+anphora+bricks+N)), places the heads at the end of the compounds, being frammenti(fragments) used to explicit the notion ?N0 is a part of N1?.As far as syntactic aspects are concerned, some open series compounds, especially referred tocoroplastic description, are sentence reductions5 in which it is used a present participle construction.For instance statua raffigurante Sileno (Silenus statue) is a reduction of the sentence:Questa statua raffigura Sileno (This statue represents Silenus)[relative]  ?
Questa ?
una statua che raffigura Sileno (This is a statue which represents Silenus)[pr.
part.]
?
Questa ?
una statua raffigurante Sileno (This is a statue representing Silenus).In compounds containing present participle forms, semantic features can be identified using localgrammars built on specific verb classes (semantic predicate sets); in such cases, co-occurrencerestrictions can be described in terms of lexical forms and syntactic structures.Figure 1.
An example of Finite State Automaton to recognize open series compounds.5Here the notation ?sentence reduction?
is to be intended in Z. S. Harris' sense.264 Ontology-Based Electronic DictionaryAn ontology-based electronic dictionary is likely to incorporate more information than thesauri.
Thiscomes from the fact that with reference to a thesaurus, an ontology also stores language-independentinformation and semantic relations.
Therefore, the use of ontology in the upgrading of LG electronicdictionaries may ensure knowledge sharing, maintenance of semantic constraints, semanticambiguities solving, and inferencing on the basis of ontology concept networks.As far as our ontology schema is concerned, we refer to ICOM International Committee forDocumentation (CIDOC) Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), an ISO standard since 2006,compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
It provides definitions and a formalstructure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in Cultural Heritagedocumentation.In our dictionary, for each entry we indicate:?
its POS (Category), internal structure and inflectional code6 (FLX);?
its variants (VAR) and synonyms (SYN), if any;?
the type of link (LINK) (RDF and/or HTML);?
with reference to our taxonomy, the pertaining knowledge domain7 (DOM);?
the CIDOC CRM Class (CCL).Entry Category InternalStructureFLX VAR SYN LINK DOM CCLdinos con ansead anelloN NPNPN C610 dynos con anse adanello/d?inos conanse ad anelloRDF RA1SUOCR E22kylix a labbrorisparmiatoN NPNA C611  lip cup RDF RA1SUOCR E22Table 2.

It aims to createa representation formalism for corpora in Resource Description Framework/Web Ontology Language(RDF/OWL).
The initiative intends to link LRs, represented in RDF, with the resources available inthe Linked Open Data (LOD)8 cloud.
The LLOD goal is not only to provide LRs in an interoperableway, but also to use an open license and link LRs with other resources in order to combine informationfrom different knowledge sources.
According to the LOD paradigm (Berners-Lee, 2006), Webresources have to present a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for entities to which they refer to, andto include links to other resources.
According to Chiarcos et al.
(2013a), ?linking to centralterminology repositories facilitates conceptual interoperability?.Benefits of LLOD are also identified in linking through URIs, federation, dynamic linking betweenresources (Chiarcos et al., 2013b).Besides, data structured in RDF format can be queried by means of the SPARQL language.
Indeed,if RDF triples represent a set of relationship among resources, than SPARQL queries are the patternsfor these relationships.One of the most relevant LLOD resources are stored in and presented by DBpedia(www.dbpedia.org).
DBPedia is a sample of large Linked Datasets, which offers Wikipediainformation in RDF format and incorporate other Web datasets.Therefore, we have referred and will refer to DBPedia Italian9 datasets to integrate our LRs withLLOD.
DBPedia Italian is an open project developed and maintained by the Web of Data10 researchunit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler11.6All inflectional codes are built by means of local grammars in the form of Finite State Automata/Transducers.7The taxonomy we use is structured on the basis of the indications given by the ICCD guidelines.
Therefore, the tagsRA1SUORC stands for Archaeological Remains/Tools/Receptacles and Containers.8http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data.9http://it.dbpedia.org/?lang=en.27According to Linked Data prescriptions, URI schema is structured ashttp://it.dbpedia.org/resource/ordine_dorico Resource URIhttp://it.dbpedia.org/page/ordine_dorico HTML representationhttp://it.dbpedia.org/data/ordine_dorico.
{ rdf | n3 | json | ntriples } Machine-readable resource representationTable 3.
Sample of URI schema for the resource ordine dorico (doric order).In order to reuse such prescriptions, we adopt a Finite State Transducer-based system which mergespecific matching URIs with electronic dictionary entries.Figure 2.
An example of Finite State Transducer for LLOD integration.When we apply the transducer to dictionary entries tagged with ?LINK=RDF?, NooJ12 generates anew string in which the resource URI is placed before the original entry.
In this way, the transducerenriches all entries of our electronic dictionary with DBPedia resources.
For instance, the result givenby the transducer for the compound Ordine dorico is the following string:Resulting strings may be used to automatically read text by means of Web browsers and/or RDFenvironments/routines.
When the generated string is processed by a Web Browser, it will generate alink to the HTML representation.
Otherwise, when the header ?HTTP Accept:?
of the query isproduced by a RDF-based application, it will produce a link to the machine-readable representation.6 Future workOur future goal is to develop an application useful for both retrieve and process RDF data from LLODresources.
We intend to implement an environment structured into two workflows: the first one (basedon SPARQL language) to query online repositories and create a system of Question-Answering, thesecond one to retrieve natural language strings, in particular those contained in the fields ?rdfs:comment?
and ?dbpedia-owl: abstract?.
Such data will constitute the basis for the development of asupervised machine-learning algorithm that, through the matching with existing dictionaries andgrammars local, will further upgrade the LRs.NoteMaria Pia di Buono is author of section 3.1, 4, 5 and 6, Mario Monteleone is author of sections 3 and3.1, Annibale Elia is author of sections 1 and 2.ReferencesEdward A.
