A Text Input Front-end Processoras an Information Access PlatformShinichi DOI, Shin-ichiro KAMEI and Kiyoshi YAMABANAC&C Media Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation4-1-1, Miyazaki, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, KANAGAWA 216-8555 JAPANs-doi@ccm.cl.nec.co.jp, kamei@ccm.cl.nec.co.jp, yamabana@ccm.cl.nec.co.jpAbstractThis paper presents a practical foreignlanguage writing support ool which makes itmuch easier to utilize dictionary and examplesentence resources.
Like a Kana-Kanjiconversion front-end processor used to inputJapanese language text, this tool is alsoimplemented as a front-end processor andcan be combined with a wide variety ofapplications.
A morphological analyzerautomatically extracts key words from text asit is being input into the tool, and these wordsare used to locate information relevant to theinput text.
This information is thenautomatically displayed to the user.
With thistool, users can concentrate better on theirwriting because much less interruption oftheir work is required for the consulting ofdictionaries or for the retrieval of referencesentences.
Retrieval and display may beconducted in any of three ways: 1) relevantinformation is retrieved and displayedautomatically; 2) information is retrievedautomatically but displayed only on usercommand; 3) information is both retrievedand displayed only on user command.
Theextent o which the retrieval and display ofinformation proceeds automatically dependson the type of information being referenced;this element of the design adds to systemefficiency.
Further, by combining this toolwith a stepped-level interactive machinetranslation function, we have created a PCsupport ool to help Japanese people write inEnglish.1.
IntroductionWhen creating text using word processingsoftware on a personal computer, it is common torefer to books or documents relevant o the text,including various kinds of dictionaries andreference works.
The tools used for accessingrelevant information, such as CD-ROMdictionaries, text databases, and text retrievalsoftware, however, often require user actionsthat may seriously interrupt he writing processitself.
These may include executing retrievalsoftware, inputting key words, or copyingretrieved information i to texts.The foreign language writing support ool wepropose here automatically access informationrelevant to input texts.
Like a Kana-Kanjiconversion front-end processor used to inputJapanese language text, this tool is alsoimplemented asa front-end processor (FEP) andcan be combined with a wide variety ofapplications.
The extent to which the retrievaland display of information proceedsautomatically depends on the type of informationbeing referenced; this element of the design addsto system efficiency.In Section 2, we consider the requirements forefficient writing support tools and discuss thecharacteristics of our front-end processor and itsautomatic nformation access function.
In Section3, we introduce our English writing support ool,which has been developed to help Japanesepeople write in English on a PC.
This.
toolcombines a front-end processor with the stepped-level interactive machine translation method wefirst proposed in Yamabana (1997).
In Section 4,we describe the automatic information accessfunction of the English writing support tool.3362.
FEP-type Information AccessPlatform2.1.
Text input front-end processor withinformation access functionsTo allow users to concentrate b tter on their work,writing support ools with reference informationaccess functions hould:1) provide for automatic access of referenceinformation, i .e .
access without explicituser commands,2) enable users to utilize retrieved informationwith simple operations, and3) be compatible with a wide variety of wordprocessing applications.In developing our FEP-type support ool, westarted with the text retrieval applicationproposed in Muraki (1997), which provides amorphological analyzer that automaticallyanalyzes users' input and extracts key words toretrieve relevant text from a database.
Thisapplication fulfills the first of the requirementlisted above.
We converted such a morphologicalanalyzer into an FEP for use in our tool, which isplaced between the keyboard and an application.When a user inputs texts into this tool, themorphological nalyzer identifies each word andextracts key words automatically before the textis entered into the application.
The key words areused to retrieve information relevant to the inputtexts.
This information is displayed for easyediting and utilization.
Because all of this can beachieved with standard hooks and the IME APIof the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system,this tool can be combined with any Windows-compatible text-input application.
In addition, itcan be combined with any other front-endprocessor, including Kana-Kanji conversionFEPs, through the use of a technique we haverecently developed.
Figure 1 shows the toolarchitecture.2.2.
Controlling the extent of theautomation of information retrievaland displayThe automatic retrieval and display functionintroduced in the previous subsection allowsusers to concentrate better on their writingInput by UserI Any Kana-Kanji Conversion FEP \[FEP-typeInformationAccess PlatformAny Text-input ApplicationMo ho,o,ic   yzor IRetrieved ~ key wordsZnfo ma,ionl In o ation  tnovo  IFie'are 1 Architecture of the FEP-tvtmv v -Information Access Platformbecause much less interruption of their work isrequired for the consulting of dictionaries or forthe retrieval of reference sentences.
This function,however, might prevent users from concentratingon their writing if all the retrieved informationwere displayed in a new window, especiallywhen the quantity of the retrieved informationwere large and the majority of it were notrelevant from the users' point of view.To compensate for this disadvantage, wedivided the information access function into threesteps: 1) extracting key words from the input text,2) using the key words to retrieve referenceinformation, and 3) displaying the retrievedinformation, and we developed a function tocontrol whether the each step is executedautomatically or manually.
We prepare threemethods for retrieval and display as follows.A) Relevant information is retrieved anddisplayed automatically, without usercommand.B) Information is retrieved automatically butdisplayed only on user command.
Afterautomatic retrieval, only the quantity ofinformation is displayed, and users candecide whether to display it.C) Information is both retrieved and displayedonly on user command.
Even in this case,because key words are automatically337extracted before retrieval, our tool requiresmuch less user action than other informationaccessing tools.The extent o which the retrieval and display ofinformation proceeds automatically depends onthe type of information being referenced; thiselement of the design adds to system efficiency.3.
Eng l i sh  Wr i t ing  Suppor t  Tool"Eibun Meibun Meikingu"By combining the FEP-type information accessplatform with the stepped-level interactivemachine translation method we proposed inYamabana (1997), we have developed an Englishwriting support ool to help Japanese p ople writein English on a PC.
This tool, named "EibunMeibun Meikingu ''l, consists of the followingthree components:1) an English writing FEP, "Eisaku Pen ''2,which converts Japanese into English,2) a CD-ROM dictionary consulting tool,"Shoseki Renzu ''3, and3) a Japanese-to-English bilingual examplesentence database, "Reibun Bainda TM.Figure 2 shows the architecture of "EibunMeibun Meikingu".
This tool is now available asa software package.3.1.
English writ ing FEP  "Eisaku Pen""Eisaku Pen" has an interactive interface similarto Kana-Kanji conversion FEPs, and initiallyreplaces most of the Japanese vocabulary itemswith English equivalents but maintains Japanesegrammatical constructions.
When a user inputsJapanese text, a conversion window of "EisakuPen" is automatically popped-up and Englishequivalents are displayed in the order of originalJapanese words.
Figure 3 illustrates how text is1 The Japanese terms Eibun, Meibun and Meikingumean, respectively, 'English writing', 'beautifulwriting' and 'making'.2 The Japanese terms Eisaku and Pen mean,respectively, 'Creating English' and 'apen'.3 The Japanese terms Shoseki and Renzu mean,respectively, 'written materials' and 'a lens'?4 The Japanese terms Reibun and Bainda mean,respectively, 'example sentences' and 'a binder'.338Any I Kana-Kanji Conversion FEP II !

When a user inputs Japanese sentence"purezento wo arigato", where each word means'present', objective marker and 'thank you'respectively, "purezento " and "arigato" arereplaced with their English equivalents 'present'and 'thank you' and displayed automatically inthe conversion window shown in the center of the11 appreciate I~]  IFigure 3 Illustration of "Eisaku Pen"figure.
The window below is an alternativeswindow to display all the possible equivalentsfor "arigato", by selecting from which, users caneasily change equivalents.
In this alternativeswindow, "Eisaku Pen" provides part-of-speech ofeach alternative quivalents and supplementaryinformation indicating the difference betweentheir meanings or usage in order to make users'equivalent selection easier.After confirming the equivalents of inputwords, users can execute the Japanese-to-Englishconversion function, which transformsJapanese grammatical constructions into those ofEnglish and the whole sentence is converted toan English sentence: 'Thank you for a present.
'by automatic word reordering and articleinsertion.
This syntactic transformationproceeds tep by step, in a bottom-up manner,combining smaller translation components intolarger ones.
Such a 'dictionary-basedinteractive translation' approach allows users torefine dictionary suggestions atdifferent steps ofthe process.
Finally, users can also easily changearticles to obtain the result sentence: 'Thankyou for the present.
'The system dictionary of "Eisaku Pen"contains about 100,000 Japanese vocabularyentries and 15,000 idiomatic expressions.
Sincethere was no source available to build an idiomdictionary of this size, we collected themmanually, from scratch, following a methoddescribed in Tamura (1997).3.2.
CD-ROM dictionary consulting tool"Shoseki Renzu"While using "Eisaku Pen", if users want to obtainmore information on words or equivalents,"Shoseki Renzu" provides a function to consultCD-ROM dictionaries.For example, when users execute the CD-ROM dictionary consulting function of "ShosekiRenzu" at the situation of the Figure 3, thecurrently selected alternative 'thank you' isregarded as a key word for dictionary consultingand the contents of the dictionaries for 'thankyou' is displayed.
If users double-click onanother word in a conversion window or analternatives window including the originalJapanese word shown at the top of the window,the word is regarded as a key word for dictionaryconsulting.3.3.
Bi l ingual example sentence database"Reibun Bainda""Eibun Meibun Meikingu" also provides afunction to retrieve and utilize bilingual examplesentences.
Example sentences relevant to thetexts input by users are retrieved from thedatabase of "Reibun Bainda" containing 3,000 ofJapanese-to-English bilingual sentence pairs forletter writing.
Figure 4 illustrates the Japanese-to-English sentence pairs retrieved when a userexecutes "Reibun Bainda" at the situation of theFigure 3.
Here, the currently selected originalJapanese word "arigato" is regarded as a keyword for retrieving and the example sentenceswhich are assigned a key word "arigato"beforehand or include strings of "arigato" in theJapanese sentence are retrieved from thebilingual example sentence database of "ReibunBainda" and displayed in the window asillustrated in Figure 4.
Japanese sentences areshown in the first column and translated Englishsentences are shown in the second one.
The thirdone is for supplementary information indicatingthe difference between meanings or usage of thesentences.
Users can easily send these sentencesto text-input applications by drag-and-dropoperation using a mouse.
In addition, by using"Eisaku Pen", users easily edit a Japanese wordand its English equivalents in example sentencessynchronously.I l l  II I I I I  I I I  II .II~l~-? "

Information Access Function ofEnglish Writing Support ToolOur tool currently accesses three types ofinformation: 1) information, included in thesystem dictionary, regarding rammatical formsand idiomatic expressions; 2) straight CD-ROMdictionary information; and 3) Japanese-to-English example sentences in the database.
Theextent to which the retrieval and display ofinformation proceeds automatically depends onthe type of information being referenced;information of type 1) is retrieved and displayedautomatically, that of type 2) is both retrievedand displayed manually, and that of type 3) isretrieved automatically but displayed manually.In the first case of translation equivalents andgrammatical information retrieval, "Eisaku Pen"automatically retrieves and displays Englishwords equivalent o the input Japanese textswithout explicit user command because usersalways utilize the English equivalents in Englishwriting.In the second case of CD-ROM dictionaryconsulting, "Shoseki Renzu" retrieves anddisplays contents of CD-ROM dictionaries onuser command because this dictionary consultingfunction needs to be executed only when usersrequire additional information.
Our tool requiresmuch less user action than other dictionaryconsulting tools because key words areautomatically extracted before user command forretrieval and users don't always need to input keywords.In the third case of bilingual sentence r trieval,"Reibun Bainda'" retrieves sentencesautomatically but displays only on user command.Because "Reibun Bainda" contains the examplesentences in itself, relevant sentences areretrieved at high speed and the retrieval functiondoesn't interrupt users' writing process.Retrieved sentences, however, might include theones not relevant o the input text from users'point of view, because similarity betweensentences i judged with a simple method usingkey words.
Therefore, the writing process mightbe interrupted if retrieved sentences weredisplayed automatically.
To avoid this problem,the color of the icon of "Reibun Bainda" ischanged after automatic retrieval, depending onthe existence of relevant sentences, and users candecide whether to display the retrieved sentences.5.
ConclusionWe present a practical foreign language writingsupport tool which makes it much easier to utilizedictionary and example sentence resources.
Thistool is implemented asa front-end processor andcan be combined with a wide variety ofapplications.
The extent to which the retrievaland display of information proceedsautomatically depends on the type of informationbeing referenced; this element of the design addsto system efficiency.
We also describe ourEnglish writing support ool with a stepped-levelinteractive machine translation function, bywhich users can write English by accessingessential information resources includingbilingual dictionaries and example sentences.Our tool is implemented asan English writingsupport ool, now under expansion to a generalwriting support tool.
Another further work isenlarging resources our tool can access.
We arealso developing an example-based translationfunction which utilizes example sentences in"Reibun Bainda" for Japanese-to-Englishconversion function of "Eisaku Pen" and anautomatic example sentence acquisition functionwhich acquires users' input texts and theirtranslation and adds them to "Reibun Bainda"automatically.ReferencesMuraki K., et al (1997) Information SharingAccelerated by Work  History BasedContribution Management, Leads to KnowhowSharing.
