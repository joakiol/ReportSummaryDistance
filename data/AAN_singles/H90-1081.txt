Evaluating the Use of Prosodic Informationin Speech Recognition and UnderstandingMari Ostendorf Patti PriceBoston University SRI InternationalObjective:The goal of this project is to investigate the use of different levels of prosodic information inspeech recognition and understanding.
In particular, the current focus of the work is the use ofprosodic phrase boundary information in parsing.
The research involves determining a repre-sentation of prosodic information suitable for use in a speech understanding system, developingreliable algorithms for detection of the prosodic cues in speech, investigating architectures forintegrating prosodic ues in a parser, and evaluating the potential improvements of prosody inthe context of the SRI Spoken Language System.
This research is sponsored jointly by DARPAand NSF.Summary of Accomplishments:Developed algorithms for the automatic detection of breaths and silences; the initial breathdetection algorithm missed only 7% of all breaths with one insertion in 6 minutes ofspeech.Implemented and evaluated several methods for automatically detecting prosodic breakindices based on relative duration; the current algorithm has a con'elation coefficient of0.85 with the labels produced by expert listeners and can handle changes in speech ratewithin a sentence.Integrated the prosodic information with the SRI natural language component by modifyingthe grammar to use the indices to rule our prosodically inconsistent syntactic hypotheses;this integration reduces the number of syntactic parses by about 25% and yields a uniqueparse for many otherwise ambiguous sentences.Plans:Evaluate the break index detection algorithms in a speaker-independent context, and onnew corpora, such as paragraphs of speech (as opposed to sentences) and spontaneousspeech.?
Improve the break index algorithms by combining different acoustic ues, including asduration, intonation and pauses/breaths.?
Develop a scoring algorithm for ranking parses according to the correlation of prosodicand syntactic information.408
