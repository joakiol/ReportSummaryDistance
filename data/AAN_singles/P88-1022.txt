TWO TYPES OF PLANNINGIN  LANGUAGE GENERATIONEduard H. HovyUSC/Informat|on Sciences Institute4676 Ar\]miralty Way, Suite 1001Marina del Rey, CA 90292-6695, U.S.A.HOVY@VAXA.ISI.EDUAbst rac tAs our understanding ofnatural language gener-ation has increased, a number of tasks have beenseparated from realization and put together un-der the heading atext planning I .
So far, however,no-one has enumerated the kinds of tasks a textplanner should be able to do.
This paper describesthe principal esson learned in combining a num-ber of planning tasks in a planner-realiser: plan-ning and realization should be interleaved, in alimited-commitment planning paradigm, to per-form two types of p\]annlng: prescriptive and re-strictive.
Limited-commitment planning consistsof both prescriptive (hierarchical expansion) plan-ning and of restrictive planning (selecting from op-tions with reference to the status of active goals).At present, existing text planners use prescriptiveplans exclusively.
However, a large class of p\]annertasks, especially those concerned with the prag-matic (non-literal) content of text such as styleand slant, is most easily performed under restric-tive planning.
The kinds of tasks suited to eachplanning style are listed, and a program that usesboth styles is described.1 I n t roduct ionPAULINE (Planning And Uttering Language InNatural Environments) is a language generationprogram that is able to realize a given input in anumber of different ways, depending on how itspragmatic (interpersonal and situation-specific)This work was done while the author was at the YaleUniversity Computer Science Departmentt New HavenThis work was supported inpart by the Advanced Re-search Projects Agency monitored by the Office of NavalResearch under contract N00014-82-K-0149.
It was alsosupported by AFOSR contract F49620-87-C-0005.goals are set by the user.
The program consistsof over 12,000 lines of T, a dialect of LISP devel-oped at Yale University.PAULINE addresses imultaneously a widerrange of problems than has been tried in any sin-gle language generation program before (with thepossible exception of \[Clippinger 74\]).
As is tobe expected, no part of PAULINE provides a sat-iefactorily detailed solution to any problem; to alarger or smaller degree, each of the questions itaddresses i solved by a set of simpl~ed, somewhatad ho?
methods.
However, this is not to say thatthe program does not provide some interesting in-sights about he nature of language generation andthe way that generators of the future will have tobe structured.One insight pertains to the problems encoun-tered when the various tasks of generation - - bothof text planning and of realization ~ are inter-leaved to provide plannlng-on-demand rather thanstrict top-down planning (which has been the ap-proach taken so far).
The planning tasks that arebest performed on demand tend to have short-range effects on the text (compared to those bestperformed in full before realization).
In orderto achieve the types of communicative goals suchtasks usually serve, the planner must ensure thatthey work together harmoniously so that theireffects support one another ather than conflict.This requirement imposes constraints on the orga-nlzation and architecture of a generation system.This paper describes PAULINE's architecture,the text planning tasks implemented, and how thetasks are managed.
Unfortunately many detailshave to be left unsaid; the interested reader is re-ferred to relevant material at appropriate points.Overview descriptions appear in \[Hovy 87a, 87b\].1791.1  The  Prob lemDepending on how the user sets the communica-tive goals, PAULINE produces over 100 variationsof an episode that took place at Yale Universityin April 1986 (it also produces multiple versionsof episodes in two other domains; see \[Hovy 86a,86b\]).
In each case, PAULINE is also given a de-scription of the hearer and the same three princi-pal topics from a single underlying representationnetwork.As a quick informal description of the episode,PAUL INE says:Exaxnple I. YALE UNIVERSITY PUNISHEDA NUMBER OF STUDENTS FOR BUILDING ASHANTYTOWN ON BEINECKE PLAZA BYARRESTING 76 STUDENTS AND TEARING ITDOWN ONE MORNING IN EARLY APRIL.
THESTUDENTS WANTED YAlE TO DIVEST FROMCOMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN SOUTHAFRICA.
FINALLY.
THE UNIVERSITY GAVEIN AND ALLDVED THE STUDENTS TOREBUILD IT.This is the kind of description one may hear from apasserby.
In contrast, when PAULINE is given thegoals to be more formal and to slant its descriptionof the episode toward the protesters, it produces:Example 2.

FINALLY, YALEPERMITTED THE STUDENTS TO RECONSTRUCT THESHASTYTOWN.Of course, in face-to-face conversations a protesterwould probably be less formal and more openlyopinionated.
PAULINE (although now spe-\]c~-gin support of the university) illustrates:Example  8.

FINALLY.
YALE GAVE INLET THE IDIOTS PUT IT UP AGAIN.
AT THESAME TIME YALE SAID THAT A COMMISSIONWOULD GO TO SOUTH AFRICA IN JULY TO CHECKOUT THE SYST\]~f OF APARTHEID, BECAUSE THEUNIVERSITY WANTED TO BE REASONABLE.The construction of such texts is beyond thecapabi~ties of most generators written to date.Though many generators would be capable ofproducing the individual sentences, some of thepre-real~ation planning tasks have never beenattempted, and others, though studied exten-sively (and in more detail than implemented inPAULINE) have not been integrated into a singleplanner under pragmatic ontrolThis paper involves the questions: what arethese pl~n-;-g tasks?
How can they all be inte-grated into one planner?
How can extralinguisticcommunicative goals be used to control the plan-ning process?
What is the nature of the relationbetween text planner and text realiser?2 Interleaving or Top-DownPlanning?2.1  The  Troub le  w i th  T rad i t iona lP lann ingIn the text planning that has been done, two prin-cipal approaches were taken.
With the integratedapproach, planning and generation is one contln-uous process: the planner-realizer handles yntac-tic constraints the same way it treats treats allother constraints (such u focus or lack of requisitehearer knowledge), the only difference being thatsyntactic constraints tend to appear late in theplanning-realisation process.
Typically, the gener-ator is written as a hierarchical expansion planner(see \[Sacerdoti 77\]) - -  this approach is exempU-fled by KAMP, Appelt's planner-generator (\[Ap-pelt 81, 82, 83, 85\]).
With the #eparated approach,planning takes place in its entirety before realiza-tion starts; once planning is over, the planner is ofno further use to the realizer.
This is the case inthe generation systems of \[McKeown 82\], \[McCoy18085\], \[R~sner 86, 87\], \[Novak 87\], \[Bienkowski 86\],\[Paris 87\], and \[McDonald & Pustejovsky 85\].Neither approach is satisfactory.
Though con-ceptually more attractive, the integrated ap-proach makes the grammar unwieldy (it is spreadthroughout he plan library) and is slow andimpractical m after all, the realization processproper is not a planning task - -  and furthermore,it is not clear whether one could formulate all textplanning tasks in a sufficiently homogeneous setof terms to be handled by a single planner.
(Thisargument ismade more fully in \[How/85\] and \[Mc-Donald & Pustejovsky 85\].)
On the other hand,the separated approach typically suffers from thestricture of a one-way narrow-bandwidth inter-face; such a planner could never take into accountfortuitous yntactic opportunities - -  or even heaware of any syntactic notion!
Though the sepa-ration permits the use of different representationsfor the planning and realization tasks, this solu-tion is hardly better:, once the planning stage isover, the realizer has no more recourse to it; ifthe realizer is able to fulfill more than one plan-ner instructions at once, or if it is unable toan instruction, it has no way to bring about anyreplanning.
Therefore, in practice, separated gen-erators perform only planning that has little orno syntactic import - -  usually, the tasks of topicchoice and sentence order.Furthermore, both these models both runcounter to human behavior: When we speak, wedo not try to satisfy only one or two goals, and weoperate (often, and with success) with conflictinggoals for which no resolution exists.
We usuallybegin to speak before we have planned out the fullutterance, and then proceed while performing cer-tain planning tasks in bottom-up fashion.2.2 A Solution: InterleavingT, Lking this into account, a better solution is toperform limited-commitment planning ~ to de-fer planning until necessitated by the realizationprocess.
The planner need assemble only a par?tial set of generator instructions m enough forthe realization component to start working onand can then continue planning when the realiza-tion component requires further guidance.
Thisapproach interleaves planning and realization andis characterized by a two-way communication atthe realizer's decision points.
The advantages are:First, it allows the separation of planning and re-alization tasks, enabling them to be handled inappropriate terms.
(In fact, it even allows theseparation of special-purpose planning tasks withidiosyncratic representational requirements o beaccommodated in special-purpose planners.)
Sec-ond, it allows planning to take into account unex-pected syntactic opportunities and inadequacies.Third, this approach accords well with the psy-cholinguistic research of \[Bock 87\], \[Rosenherg 77\],\[Danks 77\], \[De Smedt & Hempen 87\], \[Hempen& Hoenkamp 78\], \[Hempen 77, 76\], and \[Levelt& Schriefers 87\].
This is the approach taken inPAULINE.But there is a cost to this interleaving: the typeof planning typically activated by the realizer dif-fers from traditional top-clown planning.
Thereare three reasons for this.
1.
Top-down planning isprescriptive: it determines a series of actions overan extended range of time (i.e., text).
However,when the planner cannot expand its plan to thefinal level of detail m remember, it doesn't haveaccess to syntactic information m then it-has tocomplete its task by planning in-line, during real-ization.
And in-line planning usually requires onlya single decision, a selection from the syntacticallyavailable options.
After in-line planning culmi-nates in a decision, subsequent processing contin-ues as realkation - -  at least until the next set ofunprovided-for ptions.
Unfortunately, unlike hi-erarchical plan steps, subsequent in-llne planningoptidns need not work toward the same goal (or in-deed have any relation with each other); the plan-ner has no way to guess even remotely what thenext set of optious and satisfiable goals might be.2.
In-line planning is different for a second rea-son: it is impossible to formulate workable plansfor common speaker goals such as pragmatic goals.A speaker may, for example, have the goals to im-press the hearer, to make the hearer feel socially~subordinate, and yet to be relatively informalThese goals play as large a role in generation asthe speaker's goal to inform the hearer about thetopic.
However, they cannot be achieved by con-structing and following a top-down plan - -  whatwould the plan's steps prescribe?
Certainly notthe sentence "I want to impress you, but still makeyou feel subordinatem!
Pragmatic effects are bestachieved by making appropriate subtle decisionsduring the generation process: an extra adjectivehere, a slanted verb there.
Typically, this is a mat-ter of in-line planning.3.
A third difference from traditional plan-ning is the following: Some goals can be achieved,flushed from the goal list, and forgotten.
Suchgoals (for example, the goal to communicate acertain set of topics) usually activate prescriptiveplans.
In contrast, other goals cannot ever be181fully achieved.
If you are formal, you are formalthroughout the text; if you are friendly, arrogant,or opinionated, you remain so - -  you cannot sud-denly be "friendly enough" and then flush thatgoal.
These goals, which are pragmatic and stylis-tic in nature, are well suited to in-llne planning.Generation, then, requires two types of plan-ning.
Certain tasks are most easily performed intop-down fashion (that is, under guidance of a hi-erarchical planner, or of a fixed-plan (schema orscript) applier), and other tasks are most natu-rally performed in a bottom-up, selective, fashion.That is, some tasks are prescriptiee - -  they actover and give shape to long ranges of text - -  andsome are restr/ct/ee - -  they act over short rangesof text, usually as a selection from some numberof alternatives.
Prescriptive strategies are forms,tive: they control the construction and placementof parts in the paragraph and the sentence; thatis, they make some commitment to the final formof the text (such as, for example, the inclusionand order of specific sentence topics).
Restrictivestrategies are selective: they decide among alter-natives that were left open (such as, for example,the possibility of including additional topics un-der certain conditions, or the specific content ofeach sentence).
A restrictive planner cannot sim-ply plan for, it is constrained to plan with: theoptions it has to select from are presented to it bythe realizer.2 .3  P lann ing  Rest r i c t ive ly :  Mon i -to r ingSince there is no way to know which goals sub-sequent decisions will affect, restrictive planningmust keep track of all goals - -  confllcting or notand attempt to achieve them all in parallel.
Thus,due to its bottom-up, run-time nature, planningwith restrictive strategies takes the form of execu-tion monitoring (see, say, \[Fikes, Hart & Niisson72\], \[Sacerdoti 77\], \[Miller 85\], \[Doyle, Atkiuson &Doshi 86\], \[Broverman & Croft 87\]); we will usethe term monitoring here, appropriate for a sys-tem that does not take into account he world'sactual reaction (in generation, the bearer's actualresponse), but that trusts, perhaps naively, thatthe world will react in the way it expects.
Moni-toring requires the following:?
checking, updating, and recording the currentsatisfaction status of each goal?
determining which goal(s) each option willhelp satisfy, to what extent, in what ways?
determining which goal(s) each option willthwart, to what extent, and in what ways?
computing the relative priority of each goalin order to resolve conflicts (to decide, say,whether during instruction to change thetopic or to wait for a socially dominant hearerto change it)When the planner is uncertain about which long-term goals to pursue and which sequence of actionsto select, the following strategies are useful:?
prefer common intermediate goals (subgoalsshared by various goals \[Durfee & Lesser 86\])?
prefer cheaper goals (more easily achievedgoals; \[Durfee & Lesser 86\])?
prefer disorlmlnatiue ~ntermediate goals(goals that most effectively indicate the long-term promise of the avenue being explored)(\[Durfee & Lesser 86\])?
prefer least-satlsfied goals (goals furthestfrom achievement)?
prefer least-recently satisfied goals (goaLs leastrecently advanced)?
combine the latter two  strategies (a goal re-ceives higher priority the longer it waits andthe fewer times it has been advanced)3 Planning in PAULINE3.1  P rogram Arch i tec ture ,  Inputand  Op in ionsThe user provides PAULINE with input topics anda set of pragmatic goals, which activate a numberof intermediate rhetorical goals that control thestyle and slant of the text.
Whenever planning orrealization require guidance, queries are directedto the activated rhetorical goals and their associ-ated strategies (see Figure 1).Prescriptive planning is mostly performed ur-ing topic collection and topic organiEation and re-strictive planning is mostly performed uring re-alization.
Restrictive planning is implemented inPAULINE in the following way: None of the pro-gram's rhetorical goals (opinion and style) are everfully achieved and flushed; they require decisionsto be made in their favor throughout the text.PAULINE keeps track of the number of times eachsuch goal is satisfied by the selection of some op-tion (of course, a single item may help satisfy anumber of goals simultaneously).
For conflict reso-lution, PAULINE uses the least-satisfied strategy:the program chooses the option helping the goalswith the lowest total satisfaction status.
In orderto do this, it must know which goals each optionwill help satisfy.

The shantytownexample consists of about 120 elements.
No inter-mediate representation (say, one that varies de-pending on the desired slant and style) is created.PAULINE's opinions are based on the three af-fect values GOOD, NEUTRAL, and BAD, as de-scribed in \[Hovy 86b\].
Its rules for a~ect combina-tion and propagation enable the program to com-pute an opinion for any representation element.For instance, in example 2 (where PAULINEspeaks as a protester), its sympathy list cont~-.the elements representing the protesters and theprotesters' goal that Yale divest, and its antipathylist contains Yale and Yale's goal that the univer-sity remain in an orderly state.3 .2  Text  P lann ing  TasksThis section very briefly notes the text planningtasks that PAULINE perforras: topic collection,topic interpretation, additional topic inclusion,topic juxtaposition, topic ordering, intrasententialslant, and intrasententlal style.Top ic  Collection (Prescriptive): This taskcollecting, from the input elements, additionalrepresentation elements and determining whichaspects of them to say - -  is pre-eminently pre-scriptive.
Good examples of topic collection plans(also called schemas) can be found in \[McKeown82\], \[Paris & McKeown 87\], and \[R~sner 86 I. Inthis spirit PAULINE has three plans m the DE-SCRIBE plan to find descriptive aspects of ob-jects, the RELATE plan to relate events and state-changes, and the CONVINCE plan to select opicsthat will help convince the hearer of some opinion.Whenever it performs topic collection, PAULINEapplies the prescriptive steps of the appropriatecollection plan to each candidate topic, and thenin turn to the newly-found candidate topics, foras long as its pragmatic riteria (amongst others,the amount of time available) allow.
The CON-VINCE plan (described in \[Hovy 85\]) contain%183amongst others, the steps to ~ay good intention,say good results, and appeal to authority.
Example1 presents the topics as given; in example 2, theCONVINCE plan prescribes the inclusion of theprotesters' goal and the support given by the lo-cal community and faculty; and in example 3, withopposite sympathies, the same plan prescribes theinclusion of Yale's request and of the announce-ment of the investigation commission.Topic In terpretat ion  (Preser lpt lve andRestr ict ive) :  As described in \[Hovy 87c\], gen-erators that slavishly follow their input elementsusually produce bad text.
In order to produce for-mulations that are appropriately detailed and/orslanted, a generator must have the ability to ag-gregate or otherwise interpret its input elements,either individually or in groups, as instances ofother representation elements.
But finding newinterpretations can be very dlt~cult; in general,this task requires the generator (a) to run infer-ences off the input elements, and (b) to determinethe expressive suitability of resulting interpreta-tions.
Though unbounded inference is not a goodidea, limited inference under generator control canimprove text significantly.
One source of controlis the generator's pragmatic goals: it should tryonly inferences that are likely to produce goal-serving interpretations.
In this spirit, PAULINEhas a number of prescriptive and restrictive strate-gies that suggest specific interpretation i ferencesslanted towards its sympathies.
For example, in adispute between ~we ~ (the program's ympathies)and UtheyS, some of its strategies call for the in-terpretations that?
coercion: they coerce others into doing thingsfor them?
appropriation: they use ugly tactics, such astaking and using what isn't "theirs?
conciliation: we are conciliatory; we moderateour demandsInterpretation occurred in examples 1 and 3: thenotions of punishment in example 1, and of appro-priation (%ook over Beinecke Plaza s) and conc~-iation (~?ale gave in~) in example 3, did not ap-pear in the representation network.Add i t iona l  Topic Inclus ion (Restr ict ive):During the course of text planning, the genera-tor may find additional candidate topics.
Whensuch topics serve the program's goals, they can beincluded in the text.
But whether or not to in-clude these instances can only be decided whensuch topics are found; the relevant strategies aretherefore restrictive.
For example, explicit state-ments of opinion may be interjected where appro-priate, such as, in example 3, the phrases Ult pissesme off m and uI am happy that ~.Topic Juxtapos i t ion  (Restr ict ive):  By jux-taposing sentence topics in certain ways, one canachieve opinion-related and stylistic effects.
Forexample, in order to help slant the text, PAULINEuses multi-predicate phrases to imply certain af-fects.
Two such phrases are aNot only X, but Y~and uX; however, Y~; depending on the speaker'sfeelings about X, these phrases attribute feelingsto Y, even though Y may really be neutral (formore detail \[How/ 86b\]).
With respect o stylis-tic effect, the juxtaposition of several topics into asentence usually produces more complex, forma~sounding text.
For example, consider how thephrases uas a reminder w, us\]so, at that time s,and ~concurrently ~ are used in example 2 to linksentences that are separate in example 3.
Thetask of topic juxtaposition is best implemented re-strictively by presenting the candidate topics asoptions to strategies that check the restrictionson the use of phrases and select suitable ones.
(The equivalent prescriptive formulation amountsto giving the program goals such as \[find in the net-work two topics that will fit into a %Yot o,~/buffphrase\], a much less tractable task.
)Topic Order ing (Prescr ipt ive) :  The order-ing of topics in the paragraph is best achievedprescriptively.
Different circumstances call fordifferent orderings; newspaper articles, for in-stance, often contain an introductory summa-rising sentence.
In contrast to the abovemen-tioned schemas (\[McKeown 82\], etc.
), steps inPAULINE's topic collection plans are not ordered;additional plans must be run to ensure coher-ent text flow.
PAULINE uses one of two topic-ordering plans which are simplified scriptificationsof the strategies discussed in \[Hobbs 78, 79\] and\[Mann & Thompson 83, 87\].In t rasentent ia l  S lant  (Restr ict ive) :  In ad-dition to interpretation, opinion inclusion, andtopic juxtaposition, other slanting techniques in-clude the use of stress words, adjectives, adverbs,verbs that require idiosyncratic predicate con-tents, nouns, etc.
Due to the local nature of mostof these techniques and to the fact that options areonly found rather late in the realization process,they are best implemented restrictively.
In exam-ple 2, for example, the protesters are described as"a large number of concerned students ~.
This isgenerated in the following way: The generator'snoun group specialist produces, amongst others,the goals to say adjectives of number and of opin-ion.
Then the specialist hat controls the real-184ization of adjectives of number collects all the al-ternatives that express number attributively (suchas ~a few =, Zmany ~, a number) together with theconnotations each carries.
The restrictive strate-gies activated by the rhetorical goals of opinionthen select the options of ~many ~ and ~a largenumber" for their slanting effect.
Finally, the re-strictive strategies that ~xve the rhetorical goalsdetermining formality select he latter alternative.The opinion %oncerned" is realized similarly, asare the phrases zas a reminder ~and, in example3, "a few shiftless tudents" and ~idiots'.In t rasentent ia l  Style (Restr ict ive):  Con-trol of text style is pre-eminently a restrictivetask, since syntactic alternatives usually have rel-atively local effect.
PAULINE's rhetorical goals ofstyle include haste, formality, detail, simplicity (see\[Hovy 87d\]).
Associated with each goal is a set ofrestrictive strategies or plans that act ae criteriaat relevant decision points in the realization pro-cess.
Consider, for example, the stylistic differencebetween examples 2 and 3.
The former is more for-real: the sentences are longer, achieved by usingconjunctions; they contain adverbial clauses, usu-ally at the beginnings of sentences (~later, at 5:30am one morning'); adjectival descriptions are rel-ativised (anamed Winnie Mandela City'); formalnouns, verbs, and conjunctions are used (%rected,requested, concurrently, permitted=).
In contrast,example 3 seems more colloquial because the sen-tences are shorter and simpler; they contain feweradverbial clauses; and the nouns, verbs, and con-junctions are informal (ffibuilt, asked, at the sametime, let=).
Indications of the formality of phrases,nouns, and verbs are stored in discriminations inthe lexicon (patterned after \[Goldman 75\]).4 Conc lus ionThe choices distributed throughout he genera-tion process are not just a set of unrelated adhoc decisions; they are grammatically related or,through style and slant, convey pragmatic infor-mation.
Therefore, they require control Sincetraditional top-down prescriptive planning is unoable to provide adequate control, a different kindof planning is required.
The limited-commitmentplanning organization of PAULINE illustrates apossible solution.Text planning provides a wonderfully rich con-text in which to investigate the nature of prescrip-tive and restrictive planning and execution moni-toring - -  issues that are also important to generalAI planning research.5 AcknowledgementThanks to Michael Factor for comments.6 References1.2.8.4o6.6.T.Appelt, D.E., 1982.
