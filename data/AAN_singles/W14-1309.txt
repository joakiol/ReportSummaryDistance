Unfortunately,existing solutions for tasks such as namedentity recognition that perform well onformal texts usually perform poorly whenapplied to social media texts.
In this pa-per, we report on experiments that have thepurpose of improving named entity recog-nition on Turkish tweets, using two dif-ferent annotated data sets.
In these ex-periments, starting with a baseline namedentity recognition system, we adapt itsrecognition rules and resources to betterfit Twitter language by relaxing its capital-ization constraint and by diacritics-basedexpansion of its lexical resources, and weemploy a simplistic normalization schemeon tweets to observe the effects of these onthe overall named entity recognition per-formance on Turkish tweets.
The evalua-tion results of the system with these differ-ent settings are provided with discussionsof these results.1 IntroductionAnalysis of social media texts, particularly mi-croblog texts like tweets, has attracted recent at-tention due to significance of the contained in-formation for diverse application areas like trendanalysis, event monitoring, and opinion mining.Tools for well-studied problems like named entityrecognition (NER) are usually employed as com-ponents within these social media analysis appli-cations.
For instance, in (Abel et al., 2011), namedentities extracted from tweets are used to deter-mine trending topics for user modeling within thecontext of personalized recommender systems andin (Ritter et al., 2012), named entities in tweetsare used to complement the events extracted by anopen domain event extraction system for Twitter.However, existing NER solutions for well-formedtext types like news articles are reported to suf-fer from considerable performance degradationswhen they are ported to social media texts, mainlydue to the peculiarities of this latter text type (Rit-ter et al., 2011).In this paper, we report on our NER experimentson Turkish tweets in order to determine facilitatingand impeding factors during the development of aNER system for Turkish tweets which can be usedin social media analysis applications.
We carryout these experiments on two tweet data sets an-notated with named entities.
After the initial eval-uation results of a rule-based NER system (K?uc?
?ukand Yaz?c?, 2009) on these data sets, we graduallypresent the performance results achieved by theextended versions of the system together with dis-cussions of these results.
For these experiments,we first perform two system adaptations, i.e., re-laxing the capitalization constraint of the systemand diacritics-based expansion of the system?s lex-ical resources.
Next, we incorporate a simplistictweet normalization scheme into the NER proce-dure.
After the evaluation of these extensions, weprovide discussions on the plausible features of aNER system tailored to Turkish tweets.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:In Section 2, we review the literature on NER ontweets and NER on Turkish texts.
In Section 3, wepresent our NER experiments on Turkish tweets.Directions of future work are outlined in Section 4and finally Section 5 concludes the paper.2 Related WorkThere are several recent studies presenting ap-proaches for NER on microblog texts, especiallyon tweets in English.
Among these studies, in(Ritter et al., 2011), a NER system tailored to71tweets, called T-NER, is presented which employsConditional Random Fields (CRF) for named en-tity segmentation and labelled topic modelling forsubsequent classification, using Freebase dictio-naries.
A hybrid approach to NER on tweets ispresented in (Liu et al., 2011) where k-NearestNeighbor and CRF based classifiers are sequen-tially applied.
In (Liu et al., 2012), a factor graphbased approach is proposed that jointly performsNER and named entity normalization on tweets.An unsupervised approach that performs onlynamed entity extraction on tweets using resourceslike Wikipedia is described in (Li et al., 2012).
Aclustering-based approach for NER on microtextsis presented in (Jung, 2012), a lightweight filterbased approach for NER on tweets is describedin (de Oliveira et al., 2013), and a series of NERexperiments on targeted tweets in Polish is pre-sented in (Piskorski and Ehrmann, 2013).
Finally,an adaptation of the ANNIE component of GATEframework to microblog texts, called TwitIE, isdescribed in (Bontcheva et al., 2013).Considering NER research on Turkish texts,various approaches have been employed so farincluding those based on using Hidden MarkovModels (HMM) (T?ur et al., 2003), on manuallyengineered recognition rules (K?uc?
?uk and Yaz?c?,2009; K?uc?
?uk and Yaz?c?, 2012), on rule learning(Tatar and C?icekli, 2011), and on CRFs (Yeniterzi,2011; S?eker and Eryi?git, 2012).
All of these ap-proaches have been proposed for news texts andthe CRF-based approach (S?eker and Eryi?git, 2012)is reported to outperform the previous proposalswith a balanced F-Measure of about 91%.To the best of our knowledge, there are onlytwo studies on NER from Turkish tweets.
In(C?elikkaya et al., 2013), the CRF-based NER sys-tem (S?eker and Eryi?git, 2012) is evaluated on in-formal text types and is reported to achieve anF-Measure of 19% on tweets.
In (K?uc?
?uk et al.,2014), a tweet data set in Turkish annotated withnamed entities is presented.
The adaptation of amultilingual rule-based NER system (Pouliquenand Steinberger, 2009) to Turkish, which achievesan F-Measure of about 61% on a news article dataset, gets an F-Measure of 37% on this tweet dataset, and after extending the resources of the NERsystem with frequently appearing person and orga-nization names in Turkish news articles, the corre-sponding scores increase to about 69% and 43%,respectively (K?uc?
?uk et al., 2014).Table 1: NE Statistics on the Data Sets.Frequency inNE Type Tweet Set-1 Tweet Set-2Person 457 774Location 282 191Organization 241 409All PLOs 980 1,374Date 201 342Time 5 25Money 16 13Percent 9 3All NEs 1,211 1,7573 Named Entity RecognitionExperimentsThe NER experiments are performed using therule-based NER system (K?uc?
?uk and Yaz?c?, 2009)which makes use of a set of lexical resources,i.e., lists of person/location/organization names(henceforth referred to as PLOs), and patterns forthe extraction of named entities (NEs) of typePLOs and time/date/money/percent expressions(K?uc?
?uk and Yaz?c?, 2009).
The system is pro-posed for news articles which is a considerablywell-formed text type usually with proper capital-ization of the initial letters of PLOs and separa-tion of these PLOs from their suffixes with apos-trophes1.
Yet, as even such well-formed texts maybe lacking these important indicators of PLOs, thesystem can be configured to make use of the cap-italization clue or not, and it includes a simplisticmorphological analyzer to check the suffixes at theend of PLO candidates and thereby validate thesecandidates (K?uc?
?uk and Yaz?c?, 2009).This NER system achieves a balanced F-Measure of 78.7% (without giving any credit topartial extractions) on a news article data set ofabout 20K tokens obtained from the METU Turk-ish corpus (Say et al., 2002) where the annotatedform of this data set includes a total of 1,613 NEs.Within the course of the current study, we haveevaluated this system on two tweet data sets inTurkish where statistical information about thesedata sets are provided in Table 1.
The first one,which is referred to as Tweet Set?1 in Table 1,is presented in (K?uc?
?uk et al., 2014) and comprises2,320 tweets with about 20K tokens.
The sec-ond data set (Tweet Set?2) includes about 5K1An example inflected named entity of location name type(a city name) in Turkish which takes the dative case suffix(?ya) is Ankara?ya (meaning to Ankara) where the ini-tial letter of the named entity is properly capitalized and thecase suffix is accordingly separated from the entity with anapostrophe.72tweets with about 50K tokens and is described in(C?elikkaya et al., 2013).3.1 Initial ExperimentsWe have first evaluated the system?s performanceon the data sets without any extensions to the exist-ing NER system.
Table 2 presents these evaluationresults using the commonly employed metrics ofprecision, recall, and balanced F-Measure, with-out giving any credit to partially extracted NEs.Table 3 displays those results with the same met-rics this time giving credit to partial extractionswith the constraint that the NE type within the sys-tem output and the answer key must be the same,where these metrics have been employed in stud-ies like (Maynard et al., 2001).The evaluation results in Table 2 and Table3 are in line with the common finding reportedin the literature that the NER systems for com-paratively well-formed text types face consider-able performance decreases when they are eval-uated on tweets.
This observation is usually at-tributed to the peculiarities of tweet texts such ascommon grammatical/spelling errors and deliber-ate contractions.
With strict metrics, the system isreported to achieve an F-Measure rate of 78.7%.When it is ported to tweets, the best overall F-Measure rates achieved are 53.23% and 44.25%on Tweet Set?1 and Tweet Set?2, respectively,while the corresponding best F-Measure rates foronly PLOs are 47.76% and 36.63%, respectively,all with strict metrics.
The difference betweenthe results for PLOs and the overall results alsoconfirms that the system recognizes temporal andnumerical expressions (within its scope) with de-cent performance, compared to the recognition ofPLOs.The F-Measure rates obtained when partial ex-tractions are also given credit are about 5% higherthan those obtained without giving any credit topartially extracted NEs.
This increase is impor-tant due to pragmatic reasons as these partiallyextracted NEs can help conveniently filter tweetstreams and retrieve relevant subsets of tweets inseveral application settings.3.2 NER Experiments with Rule/ResourceAdaptationsTweet texts possess the following peculiaritiesusually as opposed to other formal text types:?
Grammatical/spelling errors are common,like incorrectly writing proper names all inlowercase letters.
A Turkish example illus-trating a spelling error is the use of geliyooooinstead of geliyor (meaning is coming).?
Contracted word forms are commonly usedinstead of full forms, like referring to thefootball club called Fenerbahc?e as Feneronly, where the latter contracted form is alsohomonymous to a common name in Turkish(meaning lantern).?
For the particular case of Turkish tweets,non-accentuated characters (c, g, i, o, s, andu) are often utilized instead of the corre-sponding Turkish characters with diacritics(c?, ?g, ?, ?o, s?, and ?u).
An example of this phe-nomenon is writing cunku instead of the cor-rect form, c?
?unk ?u (meaning because).Considering the above features, in order to im-prove the initial NER performance on Turkishtweets, we have tested two adaptations of the rule-based NER system.
The details of these adapta-tions and the corresponding evaluation results arepresented in the following subsections.3.2.1 Relaxing the Capitalization Constraintof the SystemAs proper capitalization of PLOs is usually lack-ing in tweets, we have evaluated the NER sys-tem with its capitalization feature turned off, sothat the system considers all tokens (no matterwhether their initial character is capitalized or not)as valid NE candidates.
The initial evaluation re-sults of the system with this setting are providedin Table 2 and Table 3 within the rows wherethe Capitalization column has a correspondingOFF value.
The results for these two capitaliza-tion settings are also similarly provided in Tables4-6 which present the evaluation results describedin the upcoming sections.The results in Table 2 and Table 3 demonstratethat relaxing the capitalization constraint (i.e., notusing the capitalization clue) during the NER pro-cedure on Turkish tweets consistently improvesperformance for PLOs on both data sets.
The im-provement obtained with this relaxation is moredramatic on Tweet Set?2 and for this data setthe overall results are accordingly better than thoseobtained when the capitalization clue is used.
Itshould again be noted that the NER system uses a73Table 2: Initial NER Evaluation Results (Strict Metrics).Data Set Capitalization Metric Person Location Organization Overall for PLOs Overall for 7 TypesTweet Set-1ONP (%) 52.82 77.78 72.34 64.16 71.13R (%) 32.82 49.65 28.22 36.53 42.53F (%) 40.49 60.61 40.60 46.55 53.23OFFP (%) 36.73 71.72 58.70 49.29 56.21R (%) 43.33 62.06 33.61 46.33 50.45F (%) 39.76 66.54 42.74 47.76 53.18Tweet Set-2ONP (%) 55.79 58.68 72.06 58.86 65.62R (%) 20.54 37.17 11.98 20.31 30.85F (%) 30.03 45.51 20.55 30.19 41.97OFFP (%) 35.61 45.53 40.72 38.31 46.27R (%) 38.37 61.26 16.63 35.08 42.40F (%) 36.94 52.23 23.61 36.63 44.25Table 3: Initial NER Evaluation Results (Partial Metrics).Data Set Capitalization Metric Person Location Organization Overall for PLOs Overall for 7 TypesTweet Set-1ONP (%) 65.33 86.05 88.37 75.98 80.74R (%) 39.38 54.01 32.34 41.87 47.13F (%) 49.14 66.37 47.35 53.99 59.52OFFP (%) 42.83 78.68 69.11 56.25 62.49R (%) 50.92 67.71 38.00 52.55 55.72F (%) 46.53 72.78 49.04 54.34 58.91Tweet Set-2ONP (%) 69.79 61.34 74.63 68.27 72.51R (%) 24.28 38.62 12.25 22.65 33.31F (%) 36.03 47.40 21.05 34.02 45.65OFFP (%) 41.82 48.41 41.99 43.21 50.91R (%) 45.10 65.59 17.06 39.38 46.45F (%) 43.40 55.71 24.26 41.21 48.58simplistic morphological analyzer to validate suf-fixes added at the ends of the NEs, thereby the sys-tem does not overgenerate with this new setting,although the precision rates decrease considerablyin return to corresponding increases in the recallrates.
To summarize, together with the fact thatabout 25.1% of all PLOs within Tweet Set?1 arelacking proper capitalization (K?uc?
?uk et al., 2014),these findings suggest that the ability to relax thiscapitalization constraint is a convenient feature ofa practical NER system for Turkish tweets.
Analternative feature would be to automatically cor-rect the capitalization of NEs instead, as a pre-processing step.3.2.2 Diacritics-Based Expansion of theLexical ResourcesIn Turkish tweet texts, words including Turkishcharacters with diacritics are often, usually ei-ther erroneously or deliberately for pragmatic rea-sons such as to type faster, spelled with their non-diacritic equivalents, as pointed out above.
There-fore, we expand the entries in the lexical resourcesof the NER system to include both diacritic andnon-diacritic variants of these entries.
For in-stance, the Turkish name of the island Cyprus,K?br?s, may appear in tweets as K?bris, Kibr?s,or Kibris, as well.
As this example denotes, foreach existing entry with n such Turkish-specificcharacters, 2nentries (including the original en-try) are included in the ultimate expanded formsof the lexical resources, since each such charactermay be used as it is or may be replaced with itsequivalent.During this expansion stage, we have applieda filtering procedure over these newly considered2n?
1 entries to check whether they are homony-mous to common names in Turkish.
This fil-tering procedure basically checks whether an ex-pansion candidate is within a list of unique, sup-posedly well-formed, Turkish words comprisingabout 1,140,208 items including inflected forms(Zemberek, 2010), and if it is, then this candidateis discarded to avoid overgeneration during the ac-tual NER procedure.We have tested this new version of the sys-tem with expanded lexical resources and the corre-sponding evaluation results are provided in Table4 and Table 5, using the strict and partial evalua-tion metrics, respectively.
Both strict and partialevaluation results denote that the performance ofthe system is improved after this diacritics-basedexpansion of the system resources.
The best re-sults are obtained when this expansion is com-bined with the relaxation of the capitalization con-straint, for PLOs on Tweet Set?1, and both forPLOs and all 7 NE types on Tweet Set?2.
Sim-ilar to the points made in the previous section,this diacritics-based expansion scheme stands asa promising feature of an ultimate NER systemfor Turkish tweets, also considering the fact that74Table 4: NER Evaluation Results After Diacritics-Based Expansion of Resources (Strict Metrics).Data Set Capitalization Metric Person Location Organization Overall for PLOs Overall for 7 TypesTweet Set-1ONP (%) 53.00 78.80 73.20 64.89 71.95R (%) 32.82 51.42 29.46 37.35 44.26F (%) 40.54 62.23 42.01 47.41 54.81OFFP (%) 36.17 71.31 59.03 48.95 56.16R (%) 43.76 63.48 35.27 47.35 52.35F (%) 39.60 67.17 44.16 48.13 54.19Tweet Set-2ONP (%) 58.22 58.73 70.67 60.20 67.29R (%) 22.87 38.74 12.96 22.13 34.89F (%) 32.84 46.69 21.90 32.36 45.95OFFP (%) 36.80 44.61 32.43 37.61 46.24R (%) 43.41 62.83 17.60 38.43 47.64F (%) 39.83 52.17 22.82 38.01 46.93Table 5: NER Evaluation Results After Diacritics-Based Expansion of Resources (Partial Metrics).Data Set Capitalization Metric Person Location Organization Overall for PLOs Overall for 7 TypesTweet Set-1ONP (%) 65.58 87.46 88.76 76.81 81.44R (%) 39.38 56.12 33.62 42.80 48.98F (%) 49.21 68.37 48.77 54.97 61.17OFFP (%) 42.21 79.17 69.00 56.02 62.49R (%) 51.56 69.85 39.70 53.88 57.90F (%) 46.42 74.22 50.40 54.93 60.11Tweet Set-2ONP (%) 71.48 61.29 72.97 69.07 73.68R (%) 26.68 40.21 13.24 24.51 37.47F (%) 38.86 48.56 22.41 36.18 49.67OFFP (%) 42.26 47.07 33.33 41.75 50.23R (%) 50.14 66.76 18.04 42.65 51.72F (%) 45.86 55.21 23.41 42.20 50.96about 6.3% of all NEs in Tweet Set?1 are writ-ten in characters with missing diacritics.
A plausi-ble alternative to this feature would be to performdiacritics-based correction (or, normalization) aspresented in studies like (Mihalcea, 2002) prior tothe actual NER procedure.
Similar approaches canbe tested on tweets in other languages having com-mon characters with diacritics.3.3 Tweet NormalizationTweet normalization has emerged as an importantresearch problem (Han and Baldwin, 2011), thesolutions to which can readily be used in systemsfor sentiment analysis and NER (as considered instudies such as (Liu et al., 2012)), among others.In order to observe the effects of normalizationon NER performance on Turkish tweets, we havefirst experimented with a simplistic tweet normal-ization scheme which aims at decreasing repeatedcharacters in words, as repetition of characters intweets is a frequent means to express stress.
Thescheme is outlined below:1.
In order to determine the list of valid Turk-ish words with consecutively repeated char-acters, we have employed the list of Turk-ish unique words (Zemberek, 2010), that wehave previously utilized during the diacritics-based resource expansion procedure in Sec-tion 3.2.2.
Within this list, 74,262 words(about 6.5% of the list) turn out to have con-secutively repeated characters.2.
Using this sublist as a reference resource, wehave implemented the actual simplistic nor-malization scheme: if a word in a tweet hasconsecutively repeated character sequencesand the word is not included within the afore-mentioned sublist, then all of these charactersequences are contracted to single characterinstances.
For instance, with this procedure,the token zamaanlaaa is correctly replacedwith zamanla (meaning with time) andmirayyy is correctly replaced with miray (aproper person name).The employment of the above normalizationscheme prior to the actual NER procedure hasled to slightly poorer results as some NEs whichshould not be normalized through this scheme arenormalized instead.
For instance, the city nameC?anakkale is changed to C?anakale during thenormalization procedure and it is missed by thesubsequent NER procedure.
Hence, we employa three-phase pipelined NER approach where wefirst run the NER procedure on the input text, thenemploy the normalization scheme on the NER out-put, and finally run the NER procedure again onthe normalization output, in order to avoid that thenormalization step corrupts well-formed NEs thatcan readily be extracted by the system.The performance of this ultimate NER pipeline,with the capitalization feature turned off during75both of the actual NER phases, is evaluated onlyon Tweet Set?1.
Therefore, the performanceevaluations of the first NER phase correspond tothe previously presented results in the rows 4-6 ofTable 2 and Table 3, with strict and partial versionsof the metrics, respectively.Below we summarize our findings regarding theintermediate normalization procedure employed,based on its evaluation results.
Although some ofthese findings are not directly relevant for the pur-poses of the NER procedure, we provide them forthe completeness of the discussion on the normal-ization of Turkish tweets.?
Excluding the normalization cases which in-volve non-alphabetical characters only (likenormalizing >>>>>> to >), those that resultin a normalized form with a single alphabet-ical character (like normalizing oooooo too), and those that involve emotion expres-sions (like normalizing :DDDDD to :D), thenumber of resulting instances considered forperformance evaluation is 494.?
The number of normalization instances inwhich an incorrect token is precisely con-verted into its corresponding valid form is253, so, the precision of the overall normal-ization scheme is 51.21%.?
117 of the incorrect cases are due to the factthat the token that is considered for normal-ization is a valid but foreign token (such asnormalizing Harry to Hary, jennifer tojenifer, full to ful, and tweet to twet).Hence, these cases account for a decrease of23.68% in the precision of the normalizationscheme.?
15 of the incorrect instances are due to thefact that Turkish characters with diacriticsare not correctly used, hence they cannot befound within the reference sublist of validTurkish words, and subsequently consideredby the normalization procedure, althoughthey could instead be subject to a diacritics-based normalization, as pointed out at the endof Section 3.2.2.
For instance, s?iir (mean-ing poem) is incorrectly written as siir ina tweet and since it, in this incorrect form,cannot be found on the reference sublist, it iserroneously changed to sir.
There are alsoother incorrect instances in which superflu-ous characters are correctly removed with thenormalization procedure, yet the resulting to-ken is still not in its correct form as a subse-quent diacritics-based correction is required.Though they are not considerably frequent(as we only consider here tokens with consec-utively repeated characters), these instancesserve to confirm that the restoration of dia-critics should be considered along with otherforms of normalization.?
Some other frequent errors made by the nor-malization scheme are due to incorrect to-kenization as whitespaces to separate to-kens can be missing due to writing errors orthe tendency to write some phrases hashtag-like.
An example case is incorrectly writ-ing the adverb, demek ki (meaning so orthat means), as demekki in a tweet, whichin turn is erroneously changed to demekiduring normalization.
This token, demekki,should not be considered within this type ofnormalization at all, although it needs pro-cessing to be transformed into its correctform, demek ki.To summarize, the normalization scheme canbe enhanced considering the above points, whereproper treatment of non-Turkish tokens and theconsideration of diacritics-based issues stand asthe most promising directions of improvement.Other more elaborate ways of normalizing tweets,as presented in studies such as (Han and Bald-win, 2011), should also be tested together withthe NER procedure, to observe their ultimate con-tribution.
Along the way, a normalization dictio-nary for Turkish can be compiled, following stud-ies like (Han et al., 2012).The evaluation results of the ultimate three-phase NER pipeline are provided in Table 6, withthe systems?s capitalization feature turned off inboth NER phases.
Within the first three rows, theresults with the strict evaluation metrics are dis-played while the last three rows present those re-sults obtained with the partial versions.
When weexamine the individual NER results after the in-corporation of normalization scheme in details, weobserve that there are cases where incorrectly nor-malizing some common names or slang/contractedwords leads to them being extracted as NEs duringthe second NER phase.
In order to prevent such76Table 6: Evaluation Results of the NER Pipeline with Normalization, on Tweet Set?1.Metric Type Metric Person Location Organization Overall for PLOs Overall for 7 TypesStrictP (%) 36.45 71.72 58.99 48.94 55.91R (%) 44.42 62.06 34.02 46.94 51.20F (%) 40.04 66.54 43.16 47.92 53.45PartialP (%) 42.32 78.68 69.35 55.73 62.04R (%) 52.07 67.71 38.43 53.18 56.48F (%) 46.69 72.78 49.45 54.43 59.13false positives, the ways of improving the normal-ization procedure discussed above can be imple-mented and thereby less errors will be propagatedinto the second NER phase.Though the overall results in Table 6 are slightlybetter than their counterparts when normalizationis not employed, we cannot derive sound conclu-sions about the contribution of this normalizationscheme to the overall NER procedure.
The slightimprovement is also an expected result as the sizeof the test data set is quite small and the numberof NEs to be recognized after this type of nor-malization is already limited since only about 1%of all PLOs in Tweet Set?1 have incorrectly re-peated consecutive characters.
Yet, the results arestill promising in that with a more elaborate nor-malization procedure evaluated on larger corpora,more dramatic increases in the NER performancecan be obtained on Turkish tweets.4 Future WorkDirections of future work based on the currentstudy include the following:?
Following the points made throughout Sec-tion 3, several normalization schemes also in-volving case and diacritics restoration can beimplemented and incorporated into the NERprocedure on tweets.?
Since tweet texts are short and informal, theyoften lack contextual clues needed to performan efficient NER procedure.
Additionally,there is a tendency to mention new and pop-ular NEs in tweets which might be missed bya NER system with static lexical resources.Hence, extending the lexical resources ofthe NER system with contemporary up-to-date NEs automatically obtained from Turk-ish news articles can be considered.
For thispurpose, we can readily employ resourceslike JRC-Names (Steinberger et al., 2011), apublicly available continuously-updated NEand name variant dictionary, as a source ofup-to-date NEs in Turkish.5 ConclusionIn this study, we target the problem of named en-tity recognition on Turkish tweets.
We have car-ried out experiments starting with a rule-basedrecognition system and gradually extended it intwo directions: adapting the rules/resources ofthe system and introducing a tweet normalizationscheme into the recognition procedure.
Thereby,we present our findings on named entity recogni-tion on Turkish tweets in addition to those on thenormalization of Turkish tweets.
Based on thesefindings, we outline some desirable features of anamed entity recognition system tailored to Turk-ish tweets.
Future work includes the employmentand testing of more elaborate tweet normalizationprocedures along the way, on larger tweet datasets, in addition to evaluating the system after itsresources are automatically extended with dictio-naries of up-to-date named entities.AcknowledgmentsThis study is supported in part by a postdoctoralresearch grant from T?UB?ITAK.ReferencesFabian Abel, Qi Gao, Geert-Jan Houben, and Ke Tao.2011.
