DESCRIPTION STR.ATEGIE.S FOR NAIVE AND EXPERT USERSC~cile L. ParisDepartment of Computer ScienceColumbia UniversityNew York, NY  10027Abst ractIt is widely recognized that a question-answerlngsystem should be able to tailor its answers to the user.One of the dimensions Mong which thus tailoring canoccur is with respect to the level of knowledge of auser about a domain.
In particular, responses shouldbe different depending on whether they are addressedto ns/ve or expert users.
To understand what thosedifferences should be, we a~alyzed texts from adultand iunior encyclopedias.
We found that two differentstrategies were used in describing complex physicalobiects to juniors and adults.
We show how thesestrategies have been implemented on a test database.INTRODUCTIONWhether the purpose of a natural language programLs to ease man-machine interactions \[Kaplan 82; Hayesand Reddy 79\] or to model human communication~Lehnert 781, it must take into conslder~tion certaincharacteristics of the person engaged in the interaction.\[n an interaction between people, the goals, beliefs,retentions, knowledge and past experience of theparticipants will play a role in how they communicatewith each other \[Cohen and Perrault 791, \[Perrault andAllen 80\[.
Similarly, those characteristics should playa role in the way a computer system interacts with auser.
In particular, a questlon-answering program thatprovides access to a large amount of data to manydifferent users will be most useful if it can tailor itsanswers to each user.We are interested here in how the level ofknowledge (or expertise) of the user a~fects an answer.As an example of this kind of tailoring in a naturallyoccurring conversation, an explanation of how a carengine works a~med a~ ~ child wdl be different thanone ~med ~tt an adult, and an explanation adequatefor a music student is probably not quite sufficient fora student in mechanic~l engineering.
\[n this paper, westudy the strategies used tn natural language todescribe physical objects to two different types ofusers: naive and expert.
By naive ~nd expert, werefer to how familiar a user m about the domain ofthe database as opposed to how experienced the useris with the question/aJnswering system.
When thedatabase ts complex, it becomes important to vary thelevel and the kind of details included in the answer inorder to provide an answer that caa be bestunderstood by the user.We plan to use this distinction in the question-answering program for RESEARCHER,  a system beingdeveloped at Columbia University.
RESEARCHERreads, remembers, and generalizes from patentsabstracts written in English \[Lebowitz 83\].
Theabstracts descrlbe complex physical objects in whichspatial and functional relations are important.
Thus,we are interested in characterizing spatial strategiesthat can be used for experts and novices about certmnphysical obiects.
We give deta41s in the paper of thecurrent implementation of description strategies on atest database of object descriptions.OUR DOMAINOur goal is to characterize some of the strategiesemployed to describe complex physical objects and seewhether these strategles are different for naive andexperts users.
To  investigate thus problem, we havelooked at texts from encyclopedias {botih adult andjunior) and high school physics textbooks ~.
The textswe have studied are about physlc~l objects performinga function (such as telephoues and telescopes), andgenerally do not exceed several paragraphs in length.These texts make the distinction between na4ve andexpert readers ~nd have been widely used for anumber of years for those audiences.
They provideexamples of different descriptive strategies that actuallyoccur in natural language.
Thus, a question-answeringsystem should be able to reproduce them-'.Studying texts from encyclopedias gives us theadvantage of being able to compare descriptions ofidentical objects aimed at two distinct audiences.

Thus a younger audience as a-whole is more naive about ~ domain than an adultaudience.
Hence, these texts give us a good startingpoint for studying the differences between theIWe studied about fifteen examples from eachencyclopedia and textbook.2Our goal however, is not to study, how effectivethese tex~s ~re for different human rea(iers.

To minimize the effects ofstyiistlc differences on our results, we chose texts fromseveral different encyclopedias in each audiencecategory.THE TEXTUAL ANALYS ISWe began by analyzing the different texts usingmethods developed by other researchers ( \[Hobbs 78a),\[Hobbs 80l, \[Mann 84\], \[McKeown 82\]) wedecomposed paragraphs in terms of their pmmitwerhetorical structure ia an attempt to find a consistentstructure tn each group of texts.
The analy.~s showedthe adult encyclopedia descriptions to be mainly mterms of the sub-parts of the object being descrlbedThese texts can be characterized by one of the textualstructures posited tn \ [McKe0wn 82\], the constituencyschema.
This structure is presented m the nextsection.
On  the other hand, no schema or otherorganizing structure consistently accounted for thedescrlptmns m the junior encyclopedia texts Inlooking for other types of organizing srrategles, wediscovered that the ma~n strategy m descrlbmg cblectsto a naive user is to trace through the process thatallows the obiect to perform Lts function.Strategy for the AdultsThe descriptions from the adult encyclopedias tend tofollow the pattern estabhshed by the constltuencyschema, one of the textual structures defined m\[McKeown 82\[.
In her work on natural languagegeneration, McKeown studied the problems of what tosay and how to organize text coherently.
Sheexamined texts and transcripts, classifying _ eachsentence as one of a set of rhetorical predicates 3 andfound that some comblnatmns of predicates were morelikely, to occur than others.
Moreover.
for eachdiscourse sltuation, some combination would be themost appropriate one.
Those standard combinationswere encoded as schemas which axe associated wlth aparticular dLscourse situation.
One of these schemas isthe constltuency schema which is used to descrlbe anobject (or concept) m terms of its subparts and theirproperties.
The constituency schema is shown below ~(For a given entity, Constituency LS the description ofits sub-parts or sub-types, and the attributive predicateglees properties associated with it.
)3Rhetorical predicates characterlze the structuralpurpose of a sentence and have been discussed b~" avamety of linguists \[Grimes 75\] fHobbs 78b| S6meexamples are constituency (describtlon of sub-parts orsub-types), attributive (providing detad about an entityor event) and analafy (-the making of an analogy).4We have altered McKeown's constituency schemaslightly by  making the first predicate optionkl Instead.of mandatory: in the texts studied, the main parts o{the object were not necessarily immediately lis~ed.
We,~,e using McKeown's notation:" {}" mdicatd optlonality,'p  indicates alternatives, "?"

Finally, ";" is used to representclszsificatlon of ambiguous propositions.239=_L l)W~en one speaks Into the transmitter of a modetqt telephone, these sound waves strikea~galnst an aluminium diak or diaphra~n and eause it to vibrate back and forth In Just the~me way the molecules of air m~ vibrating.IT.

In our test dat~ba.se, the problem ofdeclding m what order relations occur does not arise.However, for an arbitrary database, knowmg where tobegs describing a process may be more difficultSimllaxly, the process may not be as sequential ~s theones we examined so fax, and, as a result, we plan onfurther study of how to organize the informaUon.Furthermore, in our test database, we don't need tcconszder how deep into the substeps the processdescription should go, but this Issue exists for anarbitraxy database.
Finally, we have looked at thetwo ends of a spectrum (n~ve and expert), but, forusers not at either of these ends, we must considerhow to combine these strategies.243We have started to address the problem ofgenerating natural language for the descriptions.
Wehave begun the augmentation of an English surfacegenerator \]McKeown 82\] that, using ?
functionalgrammar \[Kay 79\], takes the output of the textualcomponent to translate it into English sentences "'.However, how this program may interface with thestrategies remains to be studied.CONCLUSIONIt is important to tailor a system's response to thelevel of expertme of the user.
By studying texts aimedat two different levels of readers, we have found thattwo different strategies were used in describingphysical objects, depending on whether the descriptionwas for an adult or for a junior.
For an adult, anobject is described with its sub-parts and theirproperties; for a junior, the description traces throughthe mechanical process which renders the objectfunctional.The two strategies presented account for the maredifferences found between the adult and jumor entries.This turns out not to consist of merely glving moredetails for the expert ~ m often thought \[Wallis andShortliffe 82\].
\[n the adult entries, details given aremainly about the sub-parts and thelr properties andless about the mechanical process involved.
When theprocess mechanism is mentioned at all, it is done verybriefly.
In the iumor entries, process mechanism mmore important than sub-parts and given in moredetail.
Parts are introduced either alter or at thesame time as their function is defined, and, as aconsequence, are always defined when presented.Furthermore, since the process mechanism follows everystep of the causal chain, descriptions for the novicetend to include more detail about functionalreformation than descriptions for the expert.
We haveshown how formalization of the strategies allows forthe development of question-answering systems whichcan tailor their responses to the user, given his level ofexpertise about the domaml2ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank Kathy McKeown andMichael Lebowitz for helping in both the research andthe writing of this paper.
