The efficiency of the different fea-tures is tested by building a rule-based anda learning-based chain-starting classifier.Results suggest that the classifier, whichachieves high precision at the cost of re-call, can be incorporated as either a filteror an additional feature within a corefer-ence resolution system to boost its perfor-mance.1 IntroductionAlthough often treated together, anaphoric pro-noun resolution differs from coreference resolu-tion (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).
Whereasthe former attempts to find an antecedent for eachanaphoric pronoun in a discourse, the latter aimsto build full coreference chains, namely linkingall noun phrases (NPs) ?
whether pronominal orwith a nominal head ?
that point to the same en-tity.
The output of anaphora resolution1 are noun-pronoun pairs (or pairs of a discourse segment anda pronoun in some cases), whereas the output ofcoreference resolution are chains containing a va-riety of items: pronouns, full NPs, discourse seg-ments...
Thus, coreference resolution requires awider range of strategies in order to build the fullchains of coreferent mentions.21A different matter is the resolution of anaphoric full NPs,i.e.
those semantically dependent on a previous mention.2We follow the ACE terminology (NIST, 2003) but in-stead of talking of objects in the world we talk of objects inthe discourse model: we use entity for an object or set of ob-jects in the discourse model, and mention for a reference toan entity.One of the problems specific to coreference res-olution is determining, once a mention is encoun-tered by the system, whether it refers to an entitypreviously mentioned or it introduces a new entityinto the text.
Many algorithms (Aone and Ben-nett, 1996; Soon et al, 2001; Yang et al, 2003)do not address this issue specifically, but implic-itly assume all mentions to be potentially corefer-ent and examine all possible combinations; onlyif the system fails to link a mention with an al-ready existing entity, it is considered to be chainstarting.3 However, such an approach is computa-tionally expensive and prone to errors, since nat-ural language is populated with a huge number ofentities that appear just once in the text.
Even def-inite NPs, which are traditionally believed to referto old entities, have been demonstrated to start acoreference chain over 50% of the times (Fraurud,1990; Poesio and Vieira, 1998).An alternative line of research has consideredapplying a filter prior to coreference resolutionthat classifies mentions as either chain starting orcoreferent.
Ng and Cardie (2002) and Poesio et al(2005) have tested the impact of such a detectoron the overall coreference resolution performancewith encouraging results.
Our chain-starting clas-sifier is comparable ?
despite some differences4?
to the detectors suggested by Ng and Cardie(2002), Uryupina (2003), and Poesio et al (2005)for English, but not identical to strictly anaphoricones5 (Bean and Riloff, 1999; Uryupina, 2003),since a non-anaphoric NP can corefer with a pre-vious mention.This paper presents a corpus-based study of def-3By chain starting we refer to those mentions that are thefirst element ?
and might be the only one ?
in a coreferencechain.4Ng and Cardie (2002) and Uryupina (2003) do not limitto definite NPs but deal with all types of NPs.5Notice the confusing use of the term anaphoric in (Ngand Cardie, 2002) for describing their chain-starting filteringmodule.46inite NPs in Spanish that results in a set of eightfeatures that can be used to identify chain-startingdefinite NPs.
The heuristics are tested by buildingtwo different chain-starting classifiers for Spanish,a rule-based and a learning-based one.
The evalu-ation gives priority to precision over recall in viewof the classifier?s efficiency as a filtering module.The paper proceeds as follows.
Section 2 pro-vides a qualitative comparison with related work.The corpus study and the empirically driven set ofheuristics for recognizing chain-starting definitesare described in Section 3.
The chain-starting clas-sifiers are built in Section 4.
Section 5 reports onthe evaluation and discusses its implications.
Fi-nally, Section 6 summarizes the conclusions andoutlines future work.2 Related WorkSome of the corpus-driven features here presentedhave a precedent in earlier classifiers of this kindfor English while others are our own contribution.In any case, they have been adapted and tested forSpanish for the first time.We build a list of storage units, which is in-spired by research in the field of cognitive linguis-tics.
Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003)have already employed a definite probability mea-sure in a similar way, although the way the ratiois computed is slightly different.
The former useit to make a ?definite-only list?
by ranking thosedefinites extracted from a corpus that were ob-served at least five times and never in an indefi-nite construction.
In contrast, the latter computesfour definite probabilities ?
which are includedas features within a machine-learning classifier ?from the Web in an attempt to overcome Bean andRiloff?s (1999) data sparseness problem.
The defi-nite probabilities in our approach are checked withconfidence intervals in order to guarantee the reli-ability of the results, avoiding to draw any gener-alization when the corpus does not contain a largeenough sample.The heuristics concerning named entities andstorage-unit variants find an equivalent in the fea-tures used in Ng and Cardie?s (2002) supervisedclassifier that represent whether the mention is aproper name (determined based on capitalization,whereas our corpus includes both weak and strongnamed entities) and whether a previous NP is analias of the current mention (on the basis of a rule-based alias module that tries out different transfor-mations).
Uryupina (2003) and Vieira and Poesio(2000) also take capital and low case letters intoaccount.All four approaches exploit syntactic structuralcues of pre- and post- modification to detect com-plex NPs, as they are considered to be unlikely tohave been previously mentioned in the discourse.A more fine-grained distinction is made by Beanand Riloff (1999) and Vieira and Poesio (2000)to distinguish restrictive from non-restrictive post-modification by ommitting those modifiers thatoccur between commas, which should not be clas-sified as chain starting.
The latter also list a seriesof ?special predicates?
including nouns like factor result, and adjectives such as first, best, only,etc.
A subset of the feature vectors used by Ngand Cardie (2002) and Uryupina (2003) is meantto code whether the NP is or not modified.
Inthis respect, our contribution lies in adapting theseideas for the way modification occurs in Spanish?
where premodifiers are rare ?
and in introducinga distinction between PP and AP modifiers, whichwe correlate in turn with the heads of simple defi-nites.We borrow the idea of classifying definites oc-curring in the first sentence as chain starting fromBean and Riloff (1999).The precision and recall results obtained bythese classifiers ?
tested on MUC corpora ?
arearound the eighties, and around the seventies inthe case of Vieira and Poesio (2000), who use thePenn Treebank.Luo et al (2004) make use of both a linkingand a starting probability in their Bell tree algo-rithm for coreference resolution, but the startingprobability happens to be the complementary ofthe linking one.
The chain-starting classifier webuild can be used to fine-tune the starting probabil-ity used in the construction of coreference chainsin Luo et al?s (2004) style.3 Corpus-based StudyAs fully documented by Lyons (1999), definite-ness varies cross-linguistically.
In contrast withEnglish, for instance, Spanish adds the article be-fore generic NPs (1), within some fixed phrases(2), and in postmodifiers where English makes useof bare nominal premodification (3).
Altogetherresults in a larger number of definite NPs in Span-ish and, by extension, a larger number of chain-starting definites (Recasens et al, 2009).47(1) Tard?

?Long-held claims that equate the definite arti-cle with a specific category of meaning cannot behold.
The present-day definite article is a cate-gory that, although it did originally have a seman-tic meaning of ?identifiability?, has increased itsrange of contexts so that it is often a grammati-cal rather than a semantic category (Lyons, 1999).Definite NPs cannot be considered anaphoric bydefault, but strategies need to be introduced in or-der to classify a definite as either a chain-startingor a coreferent mention.
Given that the extentof grammaticization6 varies from language to lan-guage, we considered it appropriate to conduct acorpus study oriented to Spanish: (i) to check theextent to which strategies used in previous workcan be extended to Spanish, and (ii) to explore ad-ditional linguistic cues.3.1 The corpusThe empirical data used in our corpus study comefrom AnCora-Es, the Spanish corpus of AnCora?
Annotated Corpora for Spanish and Catalan(Taule et al, 2008), developed at the Universityof Barcelona and freely available from http://clic.ub.edu/ancora.
AnCora-Es is ahalf-million-word multilevel corpus consisting ofnewspaper articles and annotated, among otherlevels of information, with PoS tags, syntacticconstituents and functions, and named entities.
Asubset of 320 000 tokens (72 500 full NPs7) wasused to draw linguistic features about definiteness.3.2 FeaturesAs quantitatively supported by the figures in Ta-ble 1, the split between simple (i.e.
non-modified)and complex NPs seems to be linguistically rele-vant.
We assume that the referential properties of6Grammaticization, or grammaticalization, is a processof linguistic change by which a content word becomes partof the grammar by losing its lexical and phonological load.7By full NPs we mean NPs with a nominal head, thusomitting pronouns, NPs with an elliptical head as well as co-ordinated NPs.simple NPs differ from complex ones, and this dis-tinction is kept when designing the eight heuristicsfor recognizing chain-starting definites that we in-troduce in this section.1.
Head match.
Ruling out those definites thatmatch an earlier noun in the text has provedto be able to filter out a considerable num-ber of coreferent mentions (Ng and Cardie,2002; Poesio et al, 2005).
We consideredboth total and partial head match, but stuckto the first as the second brought much noise.On its own, namely if definite NPs are allclassified as chain starting only if no mentionhas previously appeared with the same lexicalhead, we obtain a precision (P) not less than84.95% together with 89.68% recall (R).
Ourpurpose was to increase P as much as pos-sible with the minimum loss in R: it is pre-ferred not to classify a chain-starting instance?
which can still be detected by the corefer-ence resolution module at a later stage ?
sincea wrong label might result in a missed coref-erence link.2.
Storage units.
A very grammaticized defi-nite article accounts for the large number ofdefinite NPs attested in Spanish (column 2 inTable 1): 46% of the total.
In the light ofBybee and Hopper?s (2001) claim that lan-guage structure dynamically results from fre-quency and repetition, we hypothesized thatspecific simple definite NPs in which the ar-ticle has fully grammaticized constitute whatBybee and Hopper (2001) call storage units:the more a specific chunk is used, the morestored and automatized it becomes.
Thesearticle-noun storage units might well head acoreference chain.With a view to providing the chain-startingclassifier with a list of these article-nounstorage units, we extracted from AnCora-Esall simple NPs preceded by a determiner8(columns 2 and 3 in the second row of Table1) and ranked them by their definite probabil-ity, which we define as the number of simpledefinite NPs with respect to the number ofsimple determined NPs.
Secondly, we set athreshold of 0.7, considering as storage units8Only noun types occurring a minimum of ten times wereincluded in this study.
Singular and plural forms as well asmasculine and feminine were kept as distinct types.48Definite NPs Other det.

In orderto avoid biased probabilities due to a smallnumber of observed examples in the corpus, a95 percent confidence interval was computed.The final list includes 191 storage units, suchas la UE ?the EU?, el euro ?the euro?, los con-sumidores ?the consumers?, etc.3.
Named entities (NEs).
A closer look at thelist of storage units revealed that the higherthe definite probability, the more NE-like anoun is.
This led us to extrapolate that thedefinite article has completely grammaticized(i.e.
lost its semantic load) before simple def-inites which are NEs (e.g.
los setenta ?theseventies?, el Congreso de Estados Unidos?the U.S. Congress?9), and so they are likelyto be chain-starting.4.
Storage-unit variants.
The fact that someof the extracted storage units were variantsof a same entity gave us an additional cue:complementing the plain head_match featureby adding a gazetteer with variants (e.g.
laUnio?n Europea ?the European Union?
and laUE ?the EU?)
stops the storage_unit heuris-tic from classifying a simple definite as chainstarting if a previous equivalent unit has ap-peared.5.
First sentence.
Given that the probabilityfor any definite NP occurring in the first sen-tence of a text to be chain starting is veryhigh, since there has not been time to intro-duce many entities, all definites appearing inthe first sentence can be classified as chainstarting.6.
AP-preference nouns.
Complex definitesrepresent 62% out of all definite NPs (Table1).
In order to assess to what extent the refer-ential properties of a noun on its own dependon its combinatorial potential to occur with9The underscore represents multiword expressions.either a prepositional phrase (PP) or an ad-jectival phrase (AP), complex definites weregrouped into those containing a PP (49%) andthose containing an AP10 (27%).
Next, theprobability for each noun to be modified by aPP or an AP was computed.
The results madeit possible to draw a distinction ?
and two re-spective lists ?
between PP-preference nouns(e.g.
el inicio ?the beginning?)
and nouns thatprefer an AP modifier (e.g.
las autoridades?the authorities?).
Given that APs are not asinformative as PPs, they are more likely tomodify storage units than PPs.
Nouns witha preference for APs turned out to be storageunits or behave similarly.
Thus, simple defi-nites headed by such nouns are unlikely to becoreferent.7.
PP-preference nouns.
Nouns that prefer tocombine with a PP are those that depend onan extra argument to become referential.
Thisargument, however, might not appear as anominal modifier but be recoverable from thediscourse context, either explicitly or implic-itly.
Therefore, a simple definite headed bya PP-preference noun might be anaphoric butnot necessarily a coreferent mention.
Thus,grouping PP-preference nouns offers an em-pirical way for capturing those nouns that arebridging anaphors when they appear in a sim-ple definite.
For instance, it is not rare that,once a specific company has been introducedinto the text, reference is made for the firsttime to its director simply as el director ?thedirector?.8.
Neuter definites.
Unlike English, the Span-ish definite article is marked for grammati-cal gender.
Nouns might be either mascu-line or feminine, but a third type of definitearticle, the neuter one (lo), is used to nomi-nalize adjectives and clauses, namely ?to cre-ate a referential entity?
out of a non-nominal10When a noun was followed by more than one modifier,only the syntactic type of the first one was taken into account.49Given a definite mention m,1.
If m is introduced by a neuter definite article, classifyas chain starting.2.
If m appears in the first sentence of the document, clas-sify as chain starting.3.
If m shares the same lexical head with a previous men-tion or is a storage-unit variant of it, classify as coref-erent.4.
If the head of m is PP-preference, classify as chainstarting.5.
If m is a simple definite,(a) and the head of m appears in the list of storageunits, classify as chain starting.
(b) and the head of m is AP-preference, classify aschain starting.
(c) and m is an NE, classify as chain starting.
(d) Otherwise, classify as coreferent.6.
Otherwise (i.e.
m is a complex definite), classify aschain starting.Figure 1: Rule-based algorithm.item.
Since such neuters have a low corefer-ential capacity, the classification of these NPsas chain starting can favour recall.4 Chain-starting ClassifierIn order to test the linguistic cues outlined above,we build two different chain-starting classifiers: arule-based model and a learning-based one.
Bothaim to detect those definite NPs for which there isno need to look for a previous reference.4.1 Rule-based approachThe first way in which the linguistic findings inSection 3.2 are tested is by building a rule-basedclassifier.
The heuristics are combined and or-dered in the most efficient way, yielding the hand-crafted algorithm shown in Figure 1.
Two mainprinciples underlie the algorithm: (i) simple defi-nites tend to be coreferent mentions, and (ii) com-plex definites tend to be chain starting (if theirhead has not previously appeared).
Accordingly,Step 5 in Figure 1 finishes by classifying simpledefinites as coreferent, and Step 6 complex def-inites as chain starting.
Before these last steps,however, a series of filters are applied correspond-ing to the different heuristics.
The performance ispresented in Table 2.4.2 Machine-learning approachThe second way in which the suggested linguisticcues are tested is by constructing a learning-basedclassifier.
The Weka machine learning toolkit(Witten and Frank, 2005) is used to train a J48decision tree on a 10-fold cross-validation.
A to-tal of eight learning features are considered: (i)head match, (ii) storage-unit variant, (iii) is aneuter definite, (iv) is first sentence, (v) is a PP-preference noun, (vi) is a storage unit, (vii) isan AP-preference noun, (viii) is an NE.
All fea-tures are binary (either ?yes?
or ?no?).
We experi-ment with different feature vectors, incrementallyadding one feature at a time.
The performance ispresented in Table 3.5 EvaluationA subset of AnCora-CO-Es consisting of 60 Span-ish newspaper articles (23 335 tokens, 5 747 fullNPs) is kept apart for the test corpus.
AnCora-CO-Es is the coreferentially annotated AnCora-Escorpus, following the guidelines described in (Re-casens et al, 2007).
Coreference relations wereannotated manually with the aid of the PALinkA(Orasan, 2003) and AnCoraPipe (Bertran et al,2008) tools.
Interestingly enough, the test corpuscontains 2 575 definite NPs, out of which 1 889 arechain-starting (1401 chain-starting definite NPsare actually isolated entities), namely 73% defi-nites head a coreference chain, which implies thata successful classifier has the potential to rule outalmost three quarters of all definite mentions.Given that chain starting is the majority classand following (Ng and Cardie, 2002), we took the?one class?
classification as a naive baseline: allinstances were classified as chain starting, givinga precision of 71.95% (first row in Tables 2 and 3).5.1 PerformanceTables 2 and 3 show the results in terms of preci-sion (P), recall (R), and F0.5-measure (F0.5).
F0.5-measure,11 which weights P twice as much as R,is chosen since this classifier is designed as a filterfor a coreference resolution module and hence wewant to make sure that the discarded cases can bereally discarded.
P matters more than R.Each row incrementally adds a new heuristic tothe previous ones.
The score is cumulative.

Table 3 presents the incre-mental performance of the learning-based classi-fier for the different sets of features.Diacritics ** (p<.01) and * (p<.05) indicatewhether differences in P and R between the re-duced classifier (head_ match) and the extendedones are significant (using a one-way ANOVA fol-lowed by Tukey?s post-hoc test).5.2 DiscussionAlthough the central role played by thehead_match feature has been emphasized byprior work, it is striking that such a simple heuris-tic achieves results over 85%, raising P by 13percentage points.
All in all, these figures can onlybe slightly improved by some of the additionalfeatures.
These features have a different effecton each approach: whereas they improve P (anddecrease R) in the hand-crafted algorithm, theyimprove R (and decrease P) in the decision tree.In the first case, the highest R is achieved withthe first four features, and the last three featuresobtain an increase in P statistically significant yetaccompanied by a decrease in R also statisticallysignificant.
We expected that the second block offeatures would favour P without such a significantdrop in R.The drop in P in the decision tree is not statis-tically significant as it is in the rule-based classi-fier.
Our goal, however, was to increase P as muchas possible, since false positive errors harm theperformance of the subsequent coreference resolu-tion system much more than false negative errors,which can still be detected at a later stage.
Thevery same attributes might prove more efficient ifused as additional learning features within the vec-tor of a coreference resolution system rather thanas an independent pre-classifier.From a linguistic perspective, the fact that thelinguistic heuristics increase P provides supportfor the hypotheses about the grammaticized def-inite article and the existence of storage units.We carried out an error analysis to consider thosecases in which the features are misleading in termsof precision errors.
The first_sentence feature, forinstance, results in an error in (4), where the firstsentence includes a coreferent NP.
(4) La expansio?n de la pirater?
?a en el Sudeste de Asiapuede destruir las econom?
?as de la regio?n.
?The expansion of piracy in South-East Asia can de-stroy the economies of the region.
?Classifying PP-preference nouns as chain startingfails when a noun like el protagonista ?the pro-tagonist?, which could appear as the first mentionin a film critique, happens to be previously men-tioned with a different head.
Likewise, not usingthe same head in cases such as la competicio?n ?thecompetition?
and la Liga ?the League?
accountsfor the failure of the storage_unit or named_entityfeature, which classify the second mention aschain starting.
On the other hand, some recall er-rors are due to head_match, which might link twoNPs that despite sharing the same head point to adifferent entity (e.g.
el grupo Agnelli ?the Agnelligroup?
and el grupo industrial Montedison ?the in-dustrial group Montedison?
).6 Conclusions and Future WorkThe paper presented a corpus-driven chain-starting classifier of definite NPs for Spanish,pointing out and empirically supporting a seriesof linguistic features to be taken into account.Given that definiteness is very much language de-51pendent, the AnCora-Es corpus was mined to in-fer some linguistic hypotheses that could help inthe automatic identification of chain-starting def-inites.
The information from different linguisticlevels (lexical, semantic, morphological, syntac-tic, and pragmatic) in a computationally not ex-pensive way casts light on potential features help-ful for resolving coreference links.
Each resultingheuristic managed to improve precision althoughat the cost of a drop in recall.
The highest improve-ment in precision (89.20%) with the lowest lossin recall (78.22%) translates into an F0.5-measureof 85.21%.
Hence, the incorporation of linguisticknowledge manages to outperform the baseline by17 percentage points in precision.Priority is given to precision, since we want toassure that the filter prior to coreference resolu-tion module does not label as chain starting def-inite NPs that are coreferent.
The classifier wasthus designed to minimize false positives.
No lessthan 73% of definite NPs in the data set are chainstarting, so detecting 78% of these definites withalmost 90% precision could have substantial sav-ings.
From a linguistic perspective, the improve-ment in precision supports the linguistic hypothe-ses, even if at the expense of recall.
However, asthis classifier is not a final but a prior module, ei-ther a filter within a rule-based system or one ad-ditional feature within a larger learning-based sys-tem, the shortage of recall can be compensatedat the coreference resolution stage by consideringother more sophisticated features.The results here presented are not comparablewith other existing classifiers of this type for sev-eral reasons.
Our approach would perform differ-ently for English, which has a lower number ofdefinite NPs.
Secondly, our classifier has beenevaluated on a corpus much larger than prior onessuch as Uryupina?s (2003).
Thirdly, some classi-fiers aim at detecting non-anaphoric NPs, whichare not the same as chain-starting.
Fourthly, wehave empirically explored the contribution of theset of heuristics with respect to the head_matchfeature.
None of the existing approaches com-pares its final performance in relation with thissimple but extremely powerful feature.
Some ofour heuristics do draw on previous work, but wehave tuned them for Spanish and we have also con-tributed with new ideas, such as the use of storageunits and the preference of some nouns for a spe-cific syntactic type of modifier.As future work, we will adapt this chain-startingclassifier for Catalan, fine-tune the set of heuris-tics, and explore to what extent the inclusion ofsuch a classifier improves the overall performanceof a coreference resolution system for Spanish.Alternatively, we will consider using the sug-gested attributes as part of a larger set of learningfeatures for coreference resolution.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the three anonymousreviewers for their suggestions for improve-ment.
