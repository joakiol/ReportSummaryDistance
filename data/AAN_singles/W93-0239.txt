CSNew Mexico State UniversityLas Cruces, NM 88003wiel~e((.0mnsu.eduThis paper addresses discourse structure from the perspective of understanding.It would perhaps help us understand the na,ture of discourse relatiolls il" we better under-stood what units of a text.
can be related to one a.nother.
In Olle ma.jor theory of discoursestructure, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann &: Thompson 1988; Imrea.l'ter simply RS'T), thesmallest possible linguistic units that can lmrtMl)ate in a rhetorical rela.tion a,re called units,and "are essentially clauses, except that clausal subjects a.nd complenlents a.nd restricte(l rel-ative clauses are considered as parts of their host clause units rather than as sepa, rate units"\[p. 248\].
But both Dale and Meteer (in these proceedings) point out that rhetorical relationscan appear wi th in  clausal units.
(DMe's argument will be discussed at the end of" this paper.
)For example, the relation that is expressed in two clauses in (1.2) is expressed in only oneclause in (1.1)(from Meteer, these proceedings):(1) 1.1 My flicking the switch caused the light to turn on.1.2 Because I flicked the switch, the light turned on.Similarly, Hwang & Schubert (1992), in their work on recognizing tenq)ora.l relations amongepisodes in discourse, argue for a "fine structure" of discourse, in which temporal relationscan be established even among episodes of' subordinate clauses.This paper points out another discourse phenomenon tllat calls fbr a "fine structure"of discourse.
In passages contMning attit'udc report.s--reports of agents' beliefs, knowledge,intentions, percel)tions , etc.--rhetorical relations (:an hold such that one or more of the lin-guistic units involved in a relation is only l)a.rt of a sentence.
1 lit solne ca.ses, such a unitmay be smaller than the smallest possible unit in RST.
S1)ecifically, only the complementof an attitude report, rather than the entire sentence, might be involved in some particularrelation.
(An example is (2) below, which will be discussed shortly.)
To make matters moreconcrete, we will consider short 1)assages in which an attitude rel)ort participates in a relationindicated by the cue phrase 'but', where 'hut' is I)eing used to connect clauses.1 Note that  this paper  is meant  to illustr;Lte some COml)lexities that  I believ(~ require ;Ltt~ntion.
I lndoubtedly,similar discourse structures occur that  do not involve a.ttitude reports.148Consider the following pa.ss~ge:(2) 2.1 John knew that Ma.ry had uever beeu introduced U) Sa.m.2.2 But she had been introduced t<) Derek.One reading of this passage is tha.t (2.2), as well as (2.1), preseuts all a.ttitu(le of Johu.hnagine that (2) appears in a narrative in which .John is formiug a pla.ll, a.nd whom Mary hasand has not met is somehow inq~orta.ut t() this pb~.u.
Under this rea.diHg, (2.2) is a,n exampleof a sentence th~tt l)resents the a.ttitude of some a.gent X, even though .?
nor the attitudeare mentioned in the sentence.
(Detecting such s~ntences specilic;dly in third-persoil fictiona.\]narrative text was the focus of previous work; sue Wiel)e 1990.
)Notice that 'But' in (2.2) is being used to connect clauses, a.\]M not in addition to markthe beginning of a new discourse segment (as the term discourse ,~?
:gmcnt is used in Grosz ~Sidner 1986).
The question we are asking is what cla.uses are being connected by 'But' in (2)?Under the reading described above, the ibllowiug are the clauses participa.tiug in the relation:Mary had never l)een introduced to Sam.
\[the complement  of (2.1)\]But she had been introduced to Derek.Contrast (2) with (3):(3) 3.1 John thought that Richard ha(l sta.bl)ed him iu tile ba.ck.3.2 But John was often too suspicious of R,icha.rd.In (3), the entire senteltces (3.1) and (3.2) pa.rticil)ate in the relation iu(|ica.ted I)y 'But'.Deciding which linguistic units are involved ith a. relation is not sulficield, f<)r understan(liughow they are related, of course.
Genera.lly sl)eakiug , knowledge M)ont the world aiM/orwhat the speaker or writer is trying to accomplish iu the discourse (Moore ,~,: Pollack 1992)would presumably be involved in arrivillg at the actual contrasts being \]mule in (2) and (3)(or whatever sorts of relations are being ilMica.ted by 'But').
But to hol)(:~ to arrive at anunderstanding of such texts, an NLU system must entertain the possibility that one or moreof the linguistic units involved in the rela.tiou may I)e oMy a clausM complement.Following is another short passage in which 'but' in(licates a rela.tiotl ilivolving a.n attitu(lereport.
For this passage, R,ST units axe sufficiently fine-grained.
The pa.ssa.ge is of interest ous here because the main clause of the second seHtence, (4.3), is not involved in the relation(what are numbered in this passage a.re RST units):(4) 4.1 The car was finally coming toward him.4.2 He finished his diagnostic tests, 4.3 feeling relief.4.4 But then the car started to turu right.The relation indicated by 'But' is between his relief at the car comiug toward hiln ((4.1) and(4.3) together) and the car then turuiug right (4.4).
Tha.t is, \['or tim I~Urp(~s( ' of understandingthe relation indicated by 'But', (4.1) a.nd (4.3) ~l.re groul)ed together, which axe iu turn groupedwith (4.4).
But there are clearly also narrative relations to be rec(~guized ill this passage (e.g.,(4.2) and (4.4) are in a sequence rela.tiou), which involve other groupings (.
)\[" the clauses.
Many(such as Moore ~ Pollack 1992, and Dale, IIughes ,~,, McCoy, Meteer, aud Moser ~, Moore in149these proceedings) have noted that more tha.u oue type of rela.tiou ca.ll simultaneously holdamong elements of the discourse; we see another example of this here.
In discourses presentingattitudes, because they present states, eveuts, a.ud objects as well a.s attitudes toward them,a linguistic unit can be involved in more than one kind of relatiou, possibly grouped withdifferent units .I used "groupe(l" above for la.ck of a completely a.1)prOlMa.te t(,rm from the litera,ture.
Itwould be good to taJk a.bout these groupiugs a.s discourse segments of th(, liuguistic structureof Grosz & Sidner's theory, to distinguish lil.guistic structure, \['tom the uou-liuguistie I)a.sis t~)rthat structure.
This would I)e misleading, however, because dist'ours(, is strut'tured i~, (h'osz& Sidner's theory ou the basis of iuteutions.
A rhetorica.l relaJ.i<)u holdiug between piecesof a discourse, such as the one indic,~ted by 'But' in (4), does uot uecesm~rily make theminto a discourse segment (see Grosz &: Si(hmr 1986, p. 188, Moore ,D. Pa.ris 1992, p. 46, andDale, these proceedings, for discussiou).
Another possible term is Ma.uu &'.
Thoml)SOU'S textspan, which suggests (;Lt lea.st in pra.ctice) segmeuts tha.t a.re either uuits, or (:Oml)osed only ofa.djacent units (excluding, fiJr examl~le, a. segmeut COml)osed of (4.1) ;rod (4.3) together with(4 .4) ) .The examples given al)ove do not illustrat:e the ra,nge of l~Ossihle discourse structuresin which attitude reports participa,te.
I a,m curreutly auaJyziug text segmeuts (from oll-liuetexts) that contain 1)oth attitude terms a,ud particular cue phrases to try to ideutif~, the variouspossil)ilities.
My goa,1 is to develop a, mecha,nism that uses syuta,?
'tic a.ud lexicaJ knowledgeto identify the segments involved in the relatiou.
Without a,ccess to world a,nd/or intentionalknowledge, such a lnechauism could produce only likely hyl~(~theses; the idea.
is to see ifinformation extracted by the non-discourse (:Oml~oneuts of a,u overa.ll NLU system could I)eused to constrMn processing at deeper levels (Wiebe 1990, Bergler to a.pl~ea.r , PassonneauLitman 1993, and Hirschberg & Litma.u to a.pl)ear ea.ch address usiug one or more of synt;~ctic,lexical, orthographic, and intonatiouM iuforlma.tioll to 1)ert~rm discourse ta.sks).In summary, in discourses with attitude reports, (A) liuguistic uuits smaller than R.STunits may be involved in a. discourse relatiou, a.ud (B) a siugle liuguistic ulfit ma.y 1)e involved inmore than one kind of rela.tiou, possibly t()gether with differeut lil,guisl.i(" uuits.
As mentioneda.bove, others have also noted (A) a.ud (B).
Da.l(, ma.kes the il~l.et'(,st.itlg a.rgt.ment tha.t, a.mongother things, (A) and (B) suggest ha.t we should ba.uish those rhet?M('a.l rela.tions which simplymirror underlying knowledge-ba.se rela.tions, lu ma.uy ca,ses, he poiuts out, rhetoricaJ relationsare simply subject-matter relations--in esta.blishiug such rela.tious, a.ll w(, a.re rea.lly doing isidentifying knowledge-base r la.tions between eutities melltioued if.
the discourse.
With thisin mind, the fa.ct that we find ma.uy insta.m:es ()f (A) a.ud (B) is m)t surprisiug.
Since varioussyntactic constituents evoke various ol)jects, sta.tes, aud events, it is not surprising that onecan find discourse rel~ttions (mirroring knowledge-base r la.tious) tha.t iuvolve va.rious piecesof sentences.I think that Da.le makes some very good points.
As I suggested a.bove, olle finds structuressuch a,s the ones illustrated in this pa.per l)eca.use discourses cau pl'esel,t attitudes towardsthings as well as presenting those things themselves.
Thus, we fiu(I rela.tions a.mong 1)a.rts ofsentences evoking only the objects of attitudes, as well as ;|.l|lOllg those evoking the attitudes150themselves.
Further, I certainly do not disagree with Dale's suggestion that tocusing on thoserhetoricM relations that are clearly not domain relations would be a, way to better understandcommunicative intentions.Given a rich knowledge base, however, out of all of the possil)le knowledge-I)ase r bd, ionsthat can hohl among all the things evoked in a discourse, only some are iutended to be pickedout as the basis for coherence.
(If we allow default inference, the mmd~er of possible relationsis astounding.)
Hobbs (1979), among others, argues this.
As such, certain groupings oflinguistic units, i.e., those evoking the things involved in these relations, axe more importantthan others for establishing coherence.
Perhaps the ideal discourse model is one in which theprocess of arriving at these groupings and associated relations is governed I)y a process ofintention recognition.
But investigating local coherence directly--how it m;mifests itself invarious contexts in naturally-occurring texts, and how non-pragmatic uformation fight beexploited to recognize it--could provide important constraints tbr iHteution-ba,sed models.References\[1\] Bergler, S.
