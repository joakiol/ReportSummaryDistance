This l);qmr ,lescribesa mechanism for dealing with exc,q)tiomd transla-tion examples in our example-hosed tnLnsfer system,Sim~lban, and proposes a method for identifying suchexamples in a translation exampl~base.1 In t roduct ionand that we are given the folh)wing Japanese inputs(,~.tence (sl):(sl) watash i ( l )ha  de,,t~ku(cah'ulator) w,, shiy-OIISH rll .In the almve exami,h~s , (s l) in likely to Im more sim-ilar to (,,1) than (e2), b,~c~use the three Japaneseverbs "kyouyotmuru~" "tsakan," and "shiyousuru"are all w~ry simih~r, ~ and "dent~ku" ("calculator")is more similar to "konl)yuutaa" ("computer") than"kurum~'?'

If this is the case, the English out-put ohtained by using (el) is (tl),'-' whereas it shouldhe 0,2):In recent years~ the example-based approach ha.s beenused in many areas of natural language l)mcessing\[3, 7, 8, 10~ 9, 1\].
We haw~ been tlsing this al)-proach to develop a transfer system called 5'imTra',\[13, 14, 16\].
However, a bottleneck occured in thecollection of large numbers of translathm examplesconsisting of pairs of parsed structures in the sourceand target languages (hereafter we (:all these struc-tures translation patterns)~ because parsing is not aperfi~et process.
We now have some methods for over-coming this problem.
For instance, recent studies\[2, 11, 6, 12\] have proposed mechanisms for collectingpairs of parsed structures automatically from transla-tion examples, and in the previous paper \[15\], 1pro-posed ,~ method for extracting relevant translationpatterns by comparing a wrong translation resttlL andits correct ranslation.
Using these methods, we ca.nnow collect translation patterns reh~tively easily.There is, however, another problem ca.lled e~:ampleinte,?e,~nce, wl,ich means that an ,xceptional (or idiomatie) translation pattern is selected when a gen-eral translation pattern should be selected; this has t~side-effect on the construction of a target structure.Suppose that we have the following two translationexamples from Japanese to English (el) and (e2),(el) watashi(1) ha konpyuuta~(computer) wo kyouy--o l l s l l r l l .I share the use of ~ computer.

This ca.n be considered by using the analogyof cells like those shown in Figure 1.
In the \[igure, adot represents a translation e?aml) le ~ and a cell rep-resents a spac(!
in which an input is determined to besimilar.
According to this analogy, all example-blusedsystem chex:ks the cell in which an input is located,;~nd uses an ex~mple gow~rning the cell.
If a newexa.mt)le is added in this space, it cell for it is cre-ated as if cell division.
If an input happens to fallinto the cell of an exceptional example, it is wronglytr~mslated.

cannot he used unless it matches the input ex-actly.
Thus, an examl~le-based transfer system mustdeal with ,~xctq)tiomd translation patterns t:paratelywhen calcuhtting similarity.This paper describes a mechanism used in Sim~lFanfor dealing with exceptional translation patterns inthe same framework as general translation patterns,and proposes a method for identifying exceptionaltnrnsh~tion patterns in ~ tr~ulsla.tion pattern base.The next section describes a mechanism for dealingwith such translatimL patter.s, and Section 3 de-1 Actual ly ,  they  are in the same c~ttegory (or the same lmff)in the JItpttll~!Se thestmrus  lh  nr i-Go-l\[you \ [5 \ ] .r\['h\[~ Illltill Vftl'll iS /:llltllgl!

For instance, the distance (theinverse of similarity) between two Japanese lexical-forms is expressed by the difference of their values ina Japanese thesaurus called Bunrui-Goi-lIyou \[5\] 3 asfollows:I@hcode(w,) - bgheode(~,,~)\[ +distance(wl, w2) = bghmax + b"where bghcode(w ) is the code vMue in the Bunrui-Goi-Hyou, bghma:c is the maximal difference of thebghcodes, and 6 is a penalty value incurred when wland w2 are not identical.
This equation is used forlexical-forms in general translation patterns.
If oneis a lexicM-form which requires exact-match in an ex-ceptional translation pattern, then the distance is cal-culated as follows:0 wl is identical to w 2 distance(wl, w2) 1 othevwlseaBunrui-Goi-I Iyou is a Japanese thesaurus consisting oflarge trees for nominals, adjectives, and verbs.
Each node is as-signed a unique nmnber.
Similar concept words are locattxl insimilar positions (or assigned similar numbers) in these trees.A lexical-forni has a distinctive fea.tnre that makes itpossible to determine which equation should be usedhi cMculating similarity I if one of two le.xlcal-forms iexpressed by a single-quoted string, then the distancebetween the lexical-forms is calculated by using thesecond equation; on the other hand, if both lexical-forms are expressed by double-quoted strings, thentheir distance is calc:nlated by using the first equation.Thus, an exceptional translation pattern is distin-guished by having nodes whose lexicM-forrns aresingle-quoted strings in its source part, while ageneral translation pattern is distinguished by hav-ing nodes whose lexicM-fi~rms are all double-quotedstrings in its source part.
Not MI nodes in thesource part of an exceptional translation pattern arenecessarily single-quoted strings; single-quoted stringnodes and don bh+-quoted string nodes may be mixeclin a translation pattern, ht Figure 2, (tpl) is an ex-ceptional tr;ulslation pattern and (tp2) is a generaltranslation pattern.
Note tt~tt the root node of theJapanese part is the only single-quoted string in (tpl),and it matches only an input whose root node is 'ky-ouyoLIsHru.
~By using this distinction of lexical-forrns, we e~n inte-grate exceptionality handling into the similarity cal-culation framework without separating this task as apre process or post-process.

magiC'(Ip5)Figure 3: F, xamI)lc ,)f the identilicati(nl3 Method  for ident i fy ing ex-cept iona l  t rans lat ion  pat-ternsFor iriost peol)le , an exceptional translation patternis likely to recall a pattern of translation for an i/l-iomatic or colloquial expression, hi generM, ;in id-iomatic translation pattern is a translation patternwhose target part is markedly different from that oftranslation patterns whose s?
)urce parts am similar tothat of the idiomatic pattern.
Froni the viewpoint ofthe transfer process, what we would like to identi\[yare  translation patterns that may have side-effectswhen they are selected instead of general translationpatterns.
We call such translation patterns excep-tional travsIation pattern.s.
According to this definltlon, exceptional translation patterns are not re-stricted to idiomatic patterns, in fact, more transla-tlon l)atterns other than idiomatic ones fall into thiscategory.
Here: we classify exceptional translationpatterns into the following two categories:t Extra-Exceptional Translation l 'atterns: Thesehave some.
extra elements hi the.
target part inaddition to those in similar traimhttimi patterns.i Intra-Exceptional "\]'rans\[atlon \]>atterns: Theseare  almost same ms similar translation patterns,but several target words are different.of 0?eeptimial triulslatlon patternsWhen exceptional translation patterns are \[olind~ it ishnportant to know whether two translatiml patternsare e(lUivMent or not.
'\]'herefore> equivalent transla-tion plctterns are defined as follows:( l iven two dependency structures dl and d2, thenthey lore called equivalent if and only if ti iey are strlle-rural ly identicM and correspmiding nodes have thesimilar seinantic code.

(~) 'l'he roots of l 1 a.nd 17 are the sallle strhlg.

The extent o whh:h two words are determhw, d toI,c similar is *also a p~ranleter.
It may vary according to thesystem.
In this liltper, two words iu't~ deternllncd to be similarif they have the ~anle senuu~tic c,Me.4"/Step 1 Divide translation patterns into sew~ral groups,each of which consists of equlwdent ranslationpatterns.Step 2 For each pair of distinct translation patterngroups gl and g~, if any pattern of 9t is equiva-lent to any pattern of g2 other than nodes gov-erned by the root of the source l)art, tlmn thetranslation patterns in gl arid 92 are marked gen-er'~LStep 3 ~br each pair of distinct translation patterngroups gx and g2, if" the source part of any pat-tern (pl) of gl is equivalent to the source part ofany pattern of g2, but target parts of them arenot struetnrally identical, because Pl ha.s extraelements~ then the translation patterns of gl aremarked extm-exeeptionaLStep 4 For each non-exceptional translation patterngroup gl, if there is another general translationpattern group g~ such that any pattern (Pl) ofgl is equivMent o any pattern of g2 other thanthe root node in the target part of Pt, thenthe translation patterns of gt are marked itth'a-exceptional.Step 2 identifies possible general translation patternsif they are used in a relatively wide range of'words, be-cause in general an exceptional pattern is restrictedin the usage of words.
This approach, however, isnot perfect rot identif,ying general translation pat-terns, becanse there in ~t c~use such that the exccp-tionality derives from a single special word.
There-fore, in the next step, checking does riot exclude thesepossible general translation patterns.
Step 3 identi-ties extra-exceptional translation patterns by check-ing the structure of the target part.
Step 4 then iden-tifies intra-exceptional ones by comparing the motnode in the target part with the root nodes in the tar-get part of possible general translation patterns.
Thereason why this comparison is restricted to possiblegeneral translation patterns is that intra-excepti(n,dtranslation patterns have si(h~efrects only when theyare similar to general translation patterns.Figure 3 shows an example of the identiflcationof exceptional translation patterns, in which theJapanese verbs "kyouyousuru" and "tsukau" haw.'
thesame bghcode, and the Japanese nouns "kuruma,""denwa~" and "mahou" have different bghcodes, onthe other hand, "kuruma" and "jitensyd' have thesame bg|,eode.
First, step 1 divides tImse transla-tion patterns into four groups: group 1 c.onsists of(tpl), group 2 consists of (tp2) and (tp3), group 3consists of (tp4), and group 4 consists of (tp5).
Step2 identifies group 2 and 3 as general translation pat-terns, because "kuruma" and "denwa" have differentbghcodes.
Subsequently, step 3 identifies (tpl) as anextra-exceptional translation pattern, beci~use (tpl)has extra elements "the use of" for (tp~).
Further,step 4 identifies (tpS) as at, iutra-exceptional transla-tion pattern, because (tp5) is equivalent to the gen-eral translation patterns (tp2), (tp3) and (tp4), otherthan "use" and "practice" in the root nodes of thetarget parts.4 Exper imentsWe have tested the almve-nientioned algorithm withtranslation patterns in a Japanese-to-English trans-fer dictionary that was previously used in our lab-oratory.
For each bghcode, we.

and a.pplied the algorithm to tim transla-tion pattern set of each category.
Table 1 shows theresulting top 10 categories with respect to tt,e totalnumber of occurrences.
In most categorles, more than90% of translation patterns were identified as excep-tional.
The reason for the lopsidedness of, this resultis that tl,e translation patterns described in the pr(~vious transfer dictionary were almost all exceptionaleases that conhl not be.
de.all with by the default pro-cedures coded in the transfer module.
Therefore, thisresult indicates that the ~dgorithm is able to idenitfyexceptional translation patterns correctly.5 DiscussionIn conventhmal tra, nsfl,~r systems \[4\], transfer ules areroughly divhled into general ones and exceptional (oridiomatic) ones.
The transfer system checks the ex-cepth)nal ca.ses first, and if they cannot match theinput then the system applies general rules.
On theother hand, example-based transfer systems deal withtranslation patterns (or examples) uniformly on thebasis of similarity, according to the example-b~sedpri,ciph,.
'rids m~ci,mism causes the exanlple in-terference problem.
A very useful property of thee?ample-I)~u~e(l approach is that it allows a sente.nceto be added as an examph~ if it cannot be dealt withproperly.
This holds if the same input :~s the newlyadded example is given~ but when the resolution ofthe slmilarity calculation is not enough, an input thatis similar to but not exactly the same as the added ex-ample may not be dealt with properly, because theremay be another similar example that is exceptional.
'l'hereh)re, it is very important o identify whether anexample is general or exceptional.After application of the alg<>rithm described in thispaper, translation patterns are classified into the fol-.lowing categories: general, exceptional (extra- andintra-), and neutral.

If m~)re trans-lation patterns are added later, they m~ty be identi-fied as general or exceptional.
By this method, mmcan enable the system to identify exceptional trans-lation patterns automatically hy adding some generaltranslation I>atterns imilar to them.
This is a veryuseful feature for bootstrapping of ~t transh~ti<m pat-tern base.
A weak point of this algorithm, }mwever,is that it requires a large number of translation pat-terns.
If enough translatiml patterns ;~re not given,exceptional translation l)atterns might n(,t be identitie(\[, tlowever, collecting many tr;ulslatinn patternsis no longer a serious l)roblern, since several methodsfor eolleeti,ig them automatically have been pr/q)(Isedin recent studies \[2, 11, 14, 6\].The method proposed in this paper probad)ly doesnot comply with human intuition regarding idiomatictranslation patterns; rather, it detects transh~timtpatterns that are idiomatic for the system, in otherwords, patterns that might have side-effects in thecurrent set of translati(m patte.rns.
It prnl,ahly re-quires deeper scm~mtle pr()cessing to ide.nti fy transht-tion patterns tlu~t are idiomt~tie in the conventionalSellse.6 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have showll a problem of example-based transfer systems, example inlerfl'lv*u:e, and de-scribed a mechanism for dealing with exceptionaltranslation patterns and general translatitm p;ttternsuniformly in similarity calculation withmlt destroy-ins the whole framework of example-bmsed process-ing.
Further, we have proposed a method fi)r disl.in-guishing exceptional translation patterns from gen-eral translation patterns.
In some cases, this met.h<ntgiw~s results that do not match human intuition re-garding idiomatic translation patterns, but it can de-tect, from the viewpoint of example-based processing,tra.nslatiml p~ttterns in the current ranslation patternbase that might have side-effects.References\[1\] Furuse, O. and Iida, 1l., "Cooperation between Trans-fer and Analysis in l"~xampleqb~sed Framewc~rk," Proc.of Coling 92, Vol.
