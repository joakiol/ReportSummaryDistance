Answer Validation by Keyword AssociationMasatsugu Tonoike, Takehito Utsuro and Satoshi SatoGraduate school of Informatics, Kyoto UniversityYoshida-Honmachi, Sakyo-ku 606-8501 Kyoto, JAPAN{tonoike,utsuro,sato}@pine.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jpAbstractAnswer validation is a component of questionanswering system, which selects reliable answerfrom answer candidates extracted by certainmethods.
In this paper, we propose an approachof answer validation based on the strengths oflexical association between the keywords ex-tracted from a question sentence and each an-swer candidate.
The proposed answer valida-tion process is decomposed into two steps: thefirst is to extract appropriate keywords from aquestion sentence using word features and thestrength of lexical association, while the secondis to estimate the strength of the associationbetween the keywords and an answer candidatebased on the hits of search engines.
In the re-sult of experimental evaluation, we show that agood proportion (79%) of a multiple-choice quiz?Who wants to be a millionaire?
can be solvedby the proposed method.1 IntroductionThe technology of searching for the answer ofa question written in natural language is called?Question Answering?
(QA), and has gotten alot of attention recently.
Research activities ofQA have been promoted through competitionssuch as TREC QA Track (Voorhees, 2004) andNTCIR QAC (Fukumoto et al, 2004).
Ques-tion answering systems can be decomposed intotwo steps: first step is to collect answer can-didates, while the second is to validate each ofthose candidates.
The first step of collecting an-swer candidates has been well studied so far.
Itsstandard technology is as follows: first, the an-swer type of a question, such as LOCATION orPERSON, is identified.
Then, the documentswhich may contain answer candidates are re-trieved by querying available document set withqueries generated from the question sentence.Finally, named entities which match the answertype of the question sentence are collected fromthe retrieved documents as answer candidates.In this paper, we focus on the second step ofhow to validate an answer candidate.
Severalanswer validation methods have been proposed.One of the well-known approaches is that basedon deep understanding of text (e.g.
Moldovanet al (2003)).
In the approach of answer valida-tion based on deep understanding, first a ques-tion and the paragraph including an answer can-didate are parsed and transformed into logicalforms.
Second, the validity of the answer candi-date is examined through logical inference.
Onedrawback of this approach is that it requires arich set of lexical knowledge such as WordNetand world knowledge such as the inference ruleset.
Consequently, this approach is computa-tionally expensive.
In contrast, in this paper,we propose another approach of answer vali-dation, which is purely based on the estima-tion of the strengths of lexical association be-tween the keywords extracted from a questionsentence and each answer candidate.
One un-derlying motivation of this paper is to exam-ine the effectiveness of quite low level semanticoperation such as measuring lexical associationagainst knowledge rich NLP tasks such as an-swer validation of question answering.
Surpris-ingly, as we show later, given multiple-choices asanswer candidates of a question, a good propor-tion of a certain set of questions can be solvedby our method based on lexical association.In our framework of answer validation by key-word association (in the remaining of this paper,we call the notion of the lexical association in-troduced above as ?keyword association?
), theanswer validation process is decomposed intotwo steps: the first step is to extract appro-priate keywords from a question sentence, whilethe second step is to estimate the strength ofthe association between the keywords and ananswer candidate.
We propose two methods forthe keyword selection step: one is by a smallnumber of hand-crafted rules for determiningword weights based on word features, while theother is based on search engine hits.
In the sec-ond step of how to validate an answer candidate,the web is used as a knowledge base for estimat-ing the strength of the association between theextracted keywords and an answer candidate.Its basic idea is as follows: the stronger the as-sociation between the keywords and an answercandidate, the more frequently they co-occur onthe web.
In this paper, we introduce severalmeasures for estimating the strength of the as-sociation, and show their effectiveness throughexperimental evaluation.In this paper, in order to concentrate on theissue of answer validation, but not the whole QAprocesses, we use an existing multiple-choicequiz as the material for our study.
The multiple-choice quiz we used is taken from ?Who wants tobe a millionaire?.
?Who wants to be a million-aire?
is a famous TV show, which originated inthe United Kingdom and has been localized inmore than fifty countries.
We used the Japaneseversion, which is produced by Fuji TelevisionNetwork, Inc..
In the experimental evaluation,about 80% of the questions of this quiz can besolved by the proposed method of answer vali-dation by keyword association.Section 2 introduces the idea of question an-swering by keyword association.
Section 3 de-scribes how to select keywords from a questionsentence.
Section 4 describes how to select theanswer of multiple-choice questions.
Section 5describes how to integrate the procedures ofkeyword selection and answer selection.
Sec-tion 6 presents the results of experimental eval-uations.
Section 7 compares our work with sev-eral related works Section 8 presents our con-clusion and future works.2 Answer Validation by KeywordAssociation2.1 Keyword AssociationHere is an example of the multiple-choice quiz.Q1: Who is the director of ?American Graffiti?
?a: George Lucasb: Steven Spielbergc: Francis Ford Coppolad: Akira KurosawaSuppose that you do not know the correct an-swer and try to find it using a search engineon the Web.
The simplest way is to input thequery ?American Graffiti?
to the search engineand skim the retrieved pages.
This strategy as-sumes that the correct answer may appear onthe page that includes the keyword ?AmericanGraffiti?.
A little cleverer way is to consider thenumber of pages that contain both the keywordand a choice.
This number can be estimatedTable 1: Hits of Keywords and the Choices forthe Question Q1 (X:?American Graffiti?
)Y (choice) hits(X and Y )?George Lucas?
15,500?Steven Spielberg?
5,220?Francis Ford Coppola?
4,800?Akira Kurosawa?
836from the hits of a search engine when you in-put a conjunct query ?American Graffiti?
and?George Lucas?.
Based on this assumption, it isreasonable to hypothesize that the choice whichhas the largest hits is the answer.
For the abovequestion Q1, this strategy works.
Table 1 showsthe hits of the conjunct queries for each of thechoices.
We used ?google1?
as a search engine.Here, let X be the set of keywords, Y be thechoice.
Function hits is defined as follows.hits(X) ?
hits(x1AND x2AND ?
?
?AND xn)whereX = {x1, x2, .
.
.
, xn}The conjunct query with ?George Lucas?, whichis the correct answer, returns the largest hits.Here, the question Q1 can be regarded as aquestion on the strength of association betweenkeyword and an choice, and converted into thefollowing form.Q1?
: Select the one that has the strongest asso-ciation with ?American Graffiti?.a: George Lucasb: Steven Spielbergc: Francis Ford Coppolad: Akira KurosawaWe call this association between the keywordand the choice as keyword association.2.2 How to Select KeywordsIt is important to select appropriate keywordsfrom a question sentence.
Consider the follow-ing question.Q2: Who is the original author of the famousmovie ?Lord of the Rings?
?a: Elijah Woodb: JRR Tolkienc: Peter Jacksond: Liv TylerThe numbers of hits are shown in Table 2.
Here,let X be ?Lord of the Rings?, X ?
be ?Lord of the1http://www.google.comTable 2: Hits of Keywords and the Choicesfor the Question Q2 (X:?Lord of the Rings?,X ?
:?Lord of the Rings?
and ?original author?
)Y (choice) hits hits(X and Y ) (X ?
and Y )?Elijah Wood?
682,000 213?JRR Tolkien?
652,000 702?Peter Jackson?
1,140,000 340?Liv Tyler?
545,000 106Rings?
and ?original author?.
When you selectthe title of this movie ?Lord of the Rings?
as akeyword, the choice with the maximum hits is?Peter Jackson?, which is not the correct an-swer ?JRR Tolkien?.
However, if you select?Lord of the Rings?
and ?original author?
askeywords, this question can be solved by select-ing the choice with maximum hits.
Therefore,it is clear from this example that how to selectappropriate keywords is important.2.3 Forward and Backward AssociationFor certain questions, it is not enough to gen-erate a conjunct query consisting of some key-words and a choice, and then to simply selectthe choice with maximum hits.
This section in-troduces more sophisticated measures for select-ing an appropriate answer.
Consider the follow-ing question.Q3: Where is Pyramid?a: Canadab: Egyptc: Japand: ChinaThe numbers of hits are shown in Table 3.
Inthis case, given a conjunct query consisting ofa keyword ?Pyramid?
and a choice, the choicewith the maximum hits, i.e., ?Canada?
is notthe correct answer ?Egypt?.
Why could not thisquestion be solved?
Let us consider the hits ofthe choices alone.
The hits of the atomic query?Canada?
is about seven times larger than thehits of the atomic query ?Egypt?.
With this ob-servation, we can hypothesize that the hits of aconjunct query ?Pyramid?
and a choice are af-fected by the hits of the choice alone.
Thereforesome normalization might be required.Based on the analysis above, we employ themetrics proposed by Sato and Sasaki (2003).Sato and Sasaki (2003) has proposed two met-rics for evaluating the strength of the relationof two terms.
Suppose that X be the set ofkeywords and Y be the choice.
In this paper,we call the hits of a conjunct query consistingof keywords X and a choice Y , which is nor-malized by the hits of X, as forward associationFA(X, Y ).
We also call the hits of a conjunctquery X and Y , which is normalized by the hitsof Y , as backward association BA(X, Y ).FA(X, Y ) = hits(X ?
{Y })/hits(X)BA(X, Y ) = hits(X ?
{Y })/hits({Y })Note that when X is fixed, FA(X, Y ) is propor-tional to hits(X ?
{Y }).Let?s go back to Q3.
In this case, the choicewith the maximum BA is correct.
Some ques-tions may solved by referring to FA, while oth-ers may be solved only by referring to BA.Therefore, it is inevitable to invent a mecha-nism which switches between FA and BA.2.4 SummaryBased on the observation of Sections 2.1 ?
2.3,the following three questions must be addressedby answer validation based on keyword associ-ation.?
How to select appropriate keywords from aquestion sentence.?
How to identify the correct answer consid-ering forward and/or backward association.?
How many questions can be solved by thisstrategy based on keyword association.3 Keyword SelectionThis section describes two methods for selectingappropriate keywords from a question sentence:one is based on the features of each word, theother based on hits of a search engine.First, all the nouns are extracted from thequestion sentence using a Japanese morpholog-ical analyzer JUMAN(Kurohashi and Nagao,1999) and a Japanese parser KNP(Kurohashi,1998).
Here, when the sequence of nouns con-stitute a compound, only the longest compoundis extracted and their constituent nouns are notextracted.
Let N denote the set of those ex-tracted nouns and compounds, from which key-words are selected.
In the following, the searchengine ?goo2?
is used for obtaining the numberof hits.2http://www.goo.ne.jpTable 3: Hits of Keywords and the Choices for the Question Q3X(keyword) hits(X)Pyramid 3,170,000Y(choice) hits(Y ) hits(Y and X) FA(X , Y ) BA(X , Y )Canada 100,000,000 334,000 0.105 0.00334Egypt 14,500,000 325,000 0.103 0.0224Japan 63,100,000 246,000 0.0776 0.00390China 53,600,000 225,000 0.0710 0.004203.1 Keyword Selection Based on WordFeaturesIn this method, keywords are selected by thefollowing procedure:1.
If the question sentence contains n quota-tions with quotation marks ???
and ??
?,those n quoted strings are selected as key-words.2.
Otherwise:2-1.
According to the rules for wordweights in Table 4, weights are as-signed to each element of the keywordcandidate set N .2-2.
Select the keyword candidate with themaximum weight and that with thesecond maximum weight.2-3.
i.
If the hits of AND search of thosetwo keyword candidates are 15 ormore, both are selected as key-words.ii.
Otherwise, select the one with themaximum weight.Let k denote the set of the selected keywords(k ?
N), we examine the correctness of k asfollows.
Let c denote a choice, cF A1(k) thechoice with the maximum FA(k, c), and cBA1(k)the choice with the maximum BA(k, c), respec-tively.cF A1(k) = argmaxcFA(k, c)cBA1(k) = argmaxcBA(k, c)Here, we regard the selected keywords k to becorrect if either cF A1(k) or cBA1(k) is correct.Against the development set which is to be in-troduced in Section 6.1, the correct rate of thekeywords selected by the procedure above is84.5%.Table 4: Rules for Word Weightsrule weightn-th segment (1 +0.01 ?

5 1.23.2 Keyword Selection Based on Hitsof Search Engine3.2.1 Basic MethodsFirst, we introduce several basic methods forselecting keywords based on hits of a search en-gine.
Let 2N denote the power set of N , where aset of keywords k is an element of 2N (k ?
2N ).Let k?
denote the selected set of keywords and c?the selected choice.The first method is to simply select the pairof ?k?, c??
which gives the maximum hits as below:?k?, c??
= argmaxc, k?2Nhits(k ?
{c})Against the development set, the correct rate ofthe choice which is selected by this method is35.7%.In a similar way, another method which se-lects the maximum FA or BA can be given asbelow:?k?, c??
= argmaxc, k?2NFA(k ?
{c})?k?, c??
= argmaxc, k?2NBA(k ?
{c})Their correct rates are 71.3% and 36.1%, respec-tively.3.2.2 Keyword Association RatioNext, we introduce more sophisticated meth-ods which use the ratio of maximum and sec-ond maximum associations such as FA or BA.The underlying assumption of those methodsare that: the greater those ratios are, the morereliable is the selected choice with the maximumFA/BA.
First, we introduce two methods: FAratio and BA ratio.FA ratio This is the ratio of FA of the choicewith second maximum FA over one with maxi-mum FA.
FA ratio is calculated by the follow-ing procedure.1.
Select the choices with maximum FA andsecond maximum FA.2.
Estimate the correctness of the choice withmaximum FA by the ratio of their FAs.The set k?
of keywords and the choice c?
to beselected by FA ratio are expressed as below:k?
= argmink?2NFA(k, cF A2(k))FA(k, cF A1(k))c?
= cF A1(k?
)cF A2(k) = arg-secondmaxcFA(k, c)where arg-secondmaxcis defined as a functionwhich selects c with second maximum value.Similarly, the method based on BA ratio isgiven as below:BA ratiok?
= argmink?2NBA(k, cBA2(k))BA(k, cBA1(k))c?
= cBA1(k?
)cBA2(k) = arg-secondmaxcBA(k, c)Unlike the methods based on FA ratio andBA ratio, the following two methods considerboth FA and BA.
The motivation of those twomethods is to regard the decision by FA andBA to be reliable if FA and BA agree on se-lecting the choice.Table 5: Evaluation of Keyword AssociationRatios (precision/coverage)(%)max and second maxFA BAratioFA 63.1/100 70.6/95.0BA 75.8/93.2 67.6/100BA ratio with maximum and second max-imum FAk?

= cF A1(k?
)FA ratio with maximum and second max-imum BAk?
= argmink?2NFA(k, cBA2(k))FA(k, cBA1(k))c?
= cBA1(k?
)Coverages and precisions of these four methodsagainst the development set are shown in Ta-ble 5.
Coverage is measured as the rate of ques-tions for which the ratio is less than or equal to13.
Precisions are measured as the rate of ques-tions for which the selected choice c?
is the cor-rect answer, over those covered questions.
Themethod having the greatest precision is BA ra-tio with maximum and second maximum FA.In the following sections, we use this ratio asthe keyword association ratio.
Table 6 fartherexamines the correlation of the range of the ra-tio and the coverage/precision.
When the ratiois less than or equal to 0.25, about 60% of thequestions are solved with the precision close to90%.
This threshold of 0.25 is used in the Sec-tion 5 when integrating the keyword associationratio and word weights.4 Answer SelectionIn this section, we explain a method to identifythe correct answer considering forward and/orbackward association.
After selecting keywords,the following numbers are obtained by a searchengine.?
Hits of the keywords X: hits(X)?
Hits of the choice Y : hits({Y })3For the ratios considering both FA and BA, theratio greater than 1 means that FA and BA disagree onselecting the choice.Table 6: Evaluation of Keyword AssociationRatio: BA ratio of FA max and second-maxratio# of questionscoverage precision0 18.9% (163/888) 89.6% (146/163)?

1 93.2% (828/888) 75.8% (628/828)?
Hits of the conjunct query:hits(X ?
{Y })Then for each choice Y , FA and BA are cal-culated.
As introduced in section 3, cF A1(k) de-notes the choice whose FA value is highest, andcBA1(k) the choice whose BA value is highest.What has to done here is to decide which ofcF A1(k) and cBA1(k) is correct.After manually analyzing the search enginehits against the development set, we hand-crafted the following rules for switching betweencF A1(k) and cBA1(k).1. if cF A1(k) = cBA1(k) then cF A1(k)2. else if F A(k,cBA1(k))F A(k,cFA1(k))?

In thetable, in addition to the result of answer selec-tion rules above, the results with baselines ofselecting the choice with maximum FA or BAare also shown.
It is clear from the table thatthe answer selection rules described here signif-icantly outperforms those baselines.For each of the answer selection rules, Ta-ble 8 shows its precision.
In the developmentset4, there are 541 questions (about 60%) where4Four questions are excluded because hits of the con-junct query hits(X ?

This re-sult shows that more than half of the questionscF A1(k) is equal to cBA1(k) and about 90% ofthese questions can be solved.
This result showsthat whether FA and BA agree or not is veryimportant and is crucial for reliably selectingthe answer.5 Total Procedure of KeywordSelection and Answer SelectionFinally, the procedures of keyword selection andanswer selection presented in the previous sec-tions are integrated as given below:1.

Weexclude questions with superlative expressions(e.g., Out of the following four countries, selectthe one with the maximum number of states.
)or negation (e.g., Out of the following four col-ors, which is not used in the national flag ofFrance.)
because they are not suitable for solv-ing by keyword association.
Consequently, thedevelopment set comprises 888 questions, whilethe test set comprises 906 questions.

?Figure 1: Precision classified by prize moneyamounti.e., keyword association ratio presented in Sec-tion 3.2.2, and word weights of Section 3.1 +answer selection of Section 4.
Integration ofkeyword association ratio and word weight out-performs those baselines.
In total, about 79%(for the development set) and 76% (for the testset) of the questions are solved by the proposedanswer validation method based on keyword as-sociation.Comparing the performance of the two datasets, word weights + answer selection has 4%lower precision in the test set.
This result indi-cates that rules for word weights as well as an-swer selection rules overfit to the developmentset.
On the other hand, the difference of the pre-cisions of the keyword association ratio is muchless between the two data sets, indicating thatkeyword association ratio has less overfit to thedevelopment set.Finally, the result of the experiment wherethe development set was solved by the inte-gration method was classified by prize moneyamount.
The result is shown in Figure 1.
Themore the prize money amount is, the lower theprecision seems to be, while their precisions areall above 60%, and their differences are less than20% in most cases.
It can be concluded that oursystem can solve questions of all the levels al-most equally.7 Related WorkKwok et al (2001) proposed the first automatedquestion-answering system which uses the web.First, it collects documents that are related tothe question sentence using google and picks an-swer candidates up from them.
Second, it se-lects an answer based on the frequency of can-didates which appear near the keywords.In the method proposed by Brill et al (2002),answer candidates are picked up from the sum-mary pages returned by a search engine.
Then,each answer candidate is validated by searchingfor relevant documents in the TREC QA docu-ment collection.
Both methods do not considerthe number of hits returned by the search en-gine.Magnini et al (2002) proposed an answer val-idation method which uses the number of searchengine hits.
They formulate search enginequeries using AltaVista?s OR and NEAR oper-ators.
Major difference between the method ofMagnini et al (2002) and ours is in keyword se-lection.
In the method of Magnini et al (2002),the initial keywords are content words extractedfrom a question sentence.
If the hits of keywordsis less than a threshold, the least important key-word is removed.
This procedure is repeated un-til the hits of the keywords is over the threshold.On the other hand, in our method, keywordsare selected so that the strength of the associ-ation between the keyword and an answer can-didate is maximized.
Intuitively, our method ofkeyword selection is more natural than that ofMagnini et al (2002), since it considers boththe question sentence and an answer candidate.As for measures for scoring answer candidates,Magnini et al (2002) proposed three measures,out of which ?Corrected Conditional Probabil-ity?
performs best.
In our implementation, theperformance of ?Corrected Conditional Proba-bility?
is about 5% lower than our best result.8 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we proposed an approach of an-swer validation based on the strengths of lexi-cal association between the keywords extractedfrom a question sentence and each answer can-didate.
The proposed answer validation processis decomposed into two steps: the first is toextract appropriate keywords from a questionsentence using word features and the strengthof lexical association, while the second is to es-timate the strength of the association betweenthe keywords and an answer candidate based onthe hits of search engines.
In the result of exper-imental evaluation, we showed that a good pro-portion (79%) of the multiple-choice quiz ?Whowants to be a millionaire?
can be solved by theproposed method.Future works include the followings: first, weare planning to examine whether the syntacticstructures of the question sentence is useful forselecting appropriate keywords from the ques-tion sentence.
Secondly, it is interesting to seewhether the keyword selection method proposedin this paper is also effective for other applica-tions such as answer candidate collection of thewhole question answering process.ReferencesE.
