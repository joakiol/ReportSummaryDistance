Dialogue Translation vs.
Text Translation-Interpretation Based Approach-Jun-ichi Tsujii, Makoto NagaoDept.
of Electrical Engineering,Kyoto University,Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto, 606, JAPANAbstractThe authors discuss the differences of envi~on-meats whexe dialogue translation and textual trans-lation systems might be used.
The differences aresummarized as clear definition of information andactive participations of speakers and hearers in di-alogue t~anslation.
A new approach to MT, inter-pretation based approach, is proposed to take theadvantages of dialogue translation environments.The approach introduces a layer o/ understand-ing to MT and can produce less structure boundtranslations than conventional pproaches.1 Introduct ionAlthough we had been engaged in developing an MT sys-tem of texts for several years (Mu project \[Nagao85, Na-gao86\]), we were puzzle(| when we examined the data ofdialogue translation gathered by the research group ofATR, which is a newly established research organizationfor translation of telephone dialogues and is now gather-ing dialogue translation data in various hypothetical sit-uations.The sample translations gathered by the ATR researchgroup looked very difficult for machines, but we rarelyfound syntactic structures which make textual translationso difficult, such as long noun phrases or clauses, compli-cated conjuncted phrases, etc.
(\[Tsujii84\] \[Tsnjii88\]).
Onthe other hand, most of the translations of dialogues be-tween Japanese and English, which were produced byprofessional human interpreters, did not preserve syn-tactic structures of their original sentences at all.
Theywere completely paraphrased in the target language andseemed very hard to be produced by conventional tech-niques developed for textual MT systems.Both translations, dialogue and textual translations,are difficult, but their difficulties are very different frqmeach olher.We discuss in this paper the differences of dialoguetranslation systems and textual translation systems.
Bcauselwe do not know the difficulties of recognition of spoken ut-688terances, we will avoid the discussion about the difficultiesof interfacing the speech recognition part and the linguis-tic processing part~ which we will certainly encounter inspoken dialogue translation systems.
The dialogue trmm-lation in this paper is restricted to the translation of dia-logues through keyboards, on which ATR is now concerntrated.The differences of these two translation systems mainlycome from the fact that dialogues of certain types aremore goal-oriented than ordinary texts.
We will arguethat the goal orientedness of dialogues makes dialoguetranslation systems more feasible than textual translationsystems, though they are usually considered much harder.2 Differences o f  Env i ronmentsIn the current states of the art in machine translation,most researchers may agree that we cannot expect an idealFAMT system which can translate any linguistic materi-als in any subject domains.
So, at present, what shouldbe discussed about MT systems have to be engineeringproblems.We should discuss problems from engineering points ofview.
That is, we should discuss, first of all, what typesof systems or system organizations are economically andtechnically feasible in what situations of actual transla-tion, and what sorts of human aids can be expected inreal application environments.The important consideration is how to design feasibleMT systems which can be used in actual, rather specific,translation environments.
Different application environ-ments require different echnologies.
Therefore, the ques-tions we would like to pose in this paper are:?
Which is more feasible in actual application envi~ronments, dialogu e translation systems or textualtranslation systems ?,., ()~m ,ee design a feasible dialogue translation systemiu.~t by extending or modifying current MT tech-~,ologies dew'loped exclusively fur textual transla-tion ?Our an:~wer tothe first question, though it might soundsirs.age, is that diah)gue translation :ffstems of certain~ype.~; are more feasible than textual translation systemswhich are ( urrently developed aud connnereially a,vailable.~i, might b:~' the case that we imagin dialogue translationis ea:;ier, t ecause we have been engaged in developing at( x?1~d ~,ranslatiou system ~md have recognized many, noto~dy diiiicl,lt but ala~ m~ty a~d dirty problems iu textualtra,slatiou systems (\[Nakamura86\]).l~ut ned only because of that, we believe dialogue trans-I~,tioi~ syst:..ms are more feasible, mainly because of theba~sic diffe~eu(:es of environments where these two tyl)e~;of systems will be used.We can summarize the differences of environments inwMch th(',e two types of systeuts might be used as fbllows.~, Clear Deflnifiou of lnfo',malio'n : In certain typesof di~,.logue translations, we can define rather clearlywhat iuformaliou should be transmitted tiom sourcese:atea(:es to target translations, while we generMlycannot in textual translation.By c~:rtain types of diMogues, we mean here the di-alogues uch as dialogues for hotel reservation andcoul:erence registration which are currently pickedup by the ATR research group, dialogues betweenpatients and doctors tried by the CMU group(\['romita86\]),etc.o Actiw~ Pavlicipalious o\] Speakers and Hearers : inmost application environments of textual n~ansla -lion .,~ystems, they are supposed to be used by pTv=\]?ssio',al ~','a~tslalo'rs.
We camtot have the writersof te~.
:ts at the time of translatioxi, the persons whoprel)~.rc texts and really want to comnmnicate ,~x)rn~thing through the texts.
The actual readers of traus-luted texts are not awdlable, either, at the time ofthe translation, who.really want to get messages oriufor, aatiou eucodM in the texts.On tim contrary, in diMogue translation, we havebo~l, ~he speakers (the senders of messages) and thehearers (the receivers of me,  ages) at the time oftranslatiiig m('ssages.These two differences make, we claim, dialogue traits-lation systems more feasible in actual translation envi-ronments, if they are properly designed ibr taking theseadwmtages.Our answer to the s(~ond question is directly derivedti-om the above discussion.
That is, in ordel)to take theadvantages of dialogue translation, the system organiza-tions should be different i'om those for textual transla-tion.
Mere extension of current Mr\[ ` tec|mologies for tex-tual tl:anslation will not result in high quality dialoguetranslation systems by which ordinary people (:a~t com-municate with eact, other.We will discuss what implications the basic differencesof enviroments have in the design of dialogue transla-tion systems and, substantiate he conclusion that i\] theyare properly designed, cerlain types of dialogue IranslationsyMems, are more feasible, tex:hnically at least, than thetext translation systems which are currently available.3 What  should be t rans lated ?Fig.
1 shows a simplified framework of application sys-tems of natural language understanding (NLU) other thanMT systems.
In this framework, understanding of a ~enoleuce is regarded as a process of transformation from aninput sentence, a linear sequence of words, into so-calledthe meaning represeulalion of lhe senleuce.St ructura lI)eser ip t  ion ;of Sentencest\[ s?

I General OrgauizatiolL ofNLII hppl lcat  ion Systet~sMemdng representation i  this framework is tile in-put to certain internal processings such as deductive in:ferences, problem solvings in certain restricted omains,data base accesses, etc., which are actually implementedas computer programs to carry out certain specific inter-nM tasks.Meaning of input sentences are defined in this fi'arnc~work, relative to the internal tasks that the systems are6\[19expected to perfor m. In other words, what kinds of in-formation should be extracted from sentences are pre-defined, depending on the aims of the internal processingsof the systems.
Understanding is regarded as art extrac-tion process of information relevant o specific internaltasks.However, the internal task or the aim of translation isto re-express by using sentences of target lan-guages the information of all aspects conveyedby sentences of source languages, with as leastdistortion as possible(\[Tsujii86\]).The internal task of MT, by itself, does not definewhat information should be extracted from input texts.It is commonly recognized by linguists that all differentsurface linguistic expressions convey different meaning.MT systerns, at least textual translation systems, haveto extract all the factors relevant o the determination ofsurface linguistic expressions.Most of the difficulties peculiar to MT, such as the solection of appropriate target lexical items or expressions,etc.
come from the fact that we cannot define in MTwhat aspects of information in source sentences are rele-vant to the determination of target expressions and shouldbe extracted from source sentences?
In general, we cannotestablish a representational framework which is languageuniversal and by which understanding results are repre-sented.As a consequence, most of the current systems usecertain, linguistic levels of structural descriptions of sourcesentences, uch as deep case structures in the Mu project,in order to calculate appropriate target descriptions.
Be-cause the structures are far from representing understand-tug results and reflect the linguistic strutures of sourcesentences, their translation results are inherently struc-lure bound.On the other hands, in certain types of dialogues, wecan define by the purpose of dialogues what is essential orimportant information conveyed by uttranees and shouldbe transmitted to their translations.
Here, we do not dis-cuss about the systems which are capable of translatingarbitrary dialogues like chatterings among house wiveswithout any purposes, but the systems which translatedialogues of certain restricted omains as already men-tioned, such as dialogues for hotel reservation, conferenceregistration, etc.
In such dialogues, we can define impor-tant information by referring to the aim of the dialogues.Such important information should be extracted kom690the input and properly transmitted to the target.
So,the framework for dialogue translation becomes imilarto that of the other applications of NLU illustrated inFig.
1.
We can introduce a layer of explicit understan&in~ to MT systems, to which important information ofnntterances are related and so, in which results of under-standing can be represented in a language independent(but task dependent) way (\[Tsujii87\]).Some parts of utterances which convey information*mporlant for the purposes of the dialogues are relatedto this layer and interpreted.
Because information is ex-pressed language-independently in this layer, we can ex-pect less structure bound translation results for the partsof utterances.
On the other hand, the other parts whichdo not convey important information eed not be relatedto this explicit understanding layer.
They would be trans-lated by conventional MT technologies.Let me show you a simple example from hotel reserva-tion dialogues, which actually appears in the experimentsconducted at ATR.lax 1\]\[Japanese\] hoteru( holel)-wa, tomodachi(friends)-to Disuko( discotheque)-ni ikitai(t0 waut to go)-node, Roppongi(Roppongi - the name of theplace in Tokyo)-no chikaku(t0 be near )-ga iino(t0be good)-desuga ?\[Structure Bound English Translation\] As forhotel, because \[ I \] would like to go to Dis-cotheque with friends, to be near to Roppongiis good.\[English Translation\] Because I would like togo to discotheque with friends, I prefer to stayat a hotel near to Roppongi.In this example, we can divide the utterance into two.One is the part which contain important information forhotel reservation, and the other is the part which does not.Because the location of the hotel which the client wantsto stay is important for the task of hotel reservation, theunderlined part of the uttrance is important and shouldbe translated as properly as possible.The other part of the utterance, which gives the l:easonwhy the client wants to stay at a hotel in a specific regionof Tokyo (Roppongi), is less important.
Our contentionis that these two parts of the utterance should be treateddifferently in dialogue translation systems.Note that the English translation given above has adeep case structure completely different from that of thesource sentence.
The translation contains the verbs toprefer a~nd to slay whose corresponding Japanese verbsdo not appear in the source sentence.4 Architecture of Dialogue Trans-la.l;ion SystemsFig.

"2 fhe 0rgaaizati0n of a Dialogue Traaslatl0n 3yste~By truing these kinds of knowledge, the system shouldbe able to distinguish the parts which convey importantinformational contents extract them and relate them tothe repres:entations of the explicit understanding layer.It is certainly difficult to capture the important partsof untter~mces and understand them, but if we confineourselves to a certain restricted task domain, it is mucheasier than story understandings in general, which A1 re~searchers have been interested in.Furthermore, it is easier than developing intelligentdialogue systems which make conversations with lmmanusers in restricted task domains, for example, to makeappropriate hotel reservation.
Although those intelligentsystems hould be able to understand fully the u~r's ut-terances, a dialogue translation system needs not.
Thehearer, the receiver of the translated messages may un~derstand tile speaker's intention.
A translation systemis only required to provide information sufficient for hisunderstanding.
It is desirable but not inevitable for a dia-logue tarnslation system to have the ability of recognizingthe speaker's plan.A translation system which extracts intporlaut in/ofmutton from source utterances and re-expresses it in thetarget language can produce less structure bound trans-lations.
It can reduce varieties of surface expressions to asingle meaning representation, if they convey essentiallythe same information, the same from the view point of thepurposes of dialogue.
For example, the tbllowing Japaneseexpressions, which have quite different (deep case) struc-tures, may be reduced to a single representation and re-expressed by English expressions.
The English expres-sions will be chosen independently of Japanese strueture.
'~but only by considering English contexts where the ex--pressions are located.\[Ex 2\]\[Japanese\] Roppngi-no chikaku (to be near) -no hoteru (hotel) -gaii  (to be good) wa.\[Structure bound translation\] A hotel nearto Roppongi s good.\[Japanese\] Ropponi-atari (around) -no hoteru(hotel) -we onegaishimasu (please).---* \[Structure bound translation\] A hotel aroundKoppongi, please.\[Japanese\] hoteru (hotel)-ha roppongi-no chikaku(to be near) -ga iinodesuga (to be good)\[Structure bound translation\] As for hotel,to be near to Roppongi s good.\[Japanese\] tsugou-ga-iino (t0 be convenient)-ha roppongi-ni chikai (to be near) hoteru (ho~tel) desuga.\[Structure bound translation\] What is con-venient is a hotel near to Roppongi.As an extreme, we can imagine a system which pro-duces fluent translations only for important parts of ut-terances but awkward ones for the other parts.691\[~:x a\]\[Because (to Go Discotheque) Friends\] I preferto stay at a hotel near to Roppongi.Note that a dialogue translation system needs not un-derstand utterances completely, and so, it needs not un-derstand why the clause 'tomodachi-to disuko-ni kitai'(Iwould like to go to discotheque with friends) can be thereason tbr staying at a hotel near to Roppougi.
~lb under-stand this, a system has to have a lot of real world knowl--edge which is not so closely related with hotel reservationtasks, such as(1)Roppongi is a special region in ~lbkyo wheremany discothetques xist(2)In order to go to some place, it is preferableto stay at a hotel near to the place(3)If something is preferable, the client tendto  .
.
.
.
.etc.A system which converses intelligently with human tomake hotel reservation should have such knowledge andabilities of using it.
However, a dialogue translation sys-tem has only to provide information to the human partic~ipants who organize conversation i telligently.5 Act ive Part ic ipation of Speak-ers and HearersWhat should be understood from texts is highly depen-dent on the intentions of actual writers and readers oftexts, but r,either of them is available at the time of traus-lation in textual translation.The same texts would be read by different readers withdifferent intentions who would like to get different sortsof information from the translated texts.Readers of translated texts are often irritated becausethey cannot get necessary information for them.
We foundthat translated texts are irritating not only because trans-lations are awkward, but also because original texts tt,em.-selves do not contain in/ormation which actual readerswould like to get.
Furthermore, evaluating translationsproduced by MT systems is difficult, because the evalua-tion highly depends on both what readers want to knowand what source texts really contain.
MT systems cannotproduce good translations from bad source texts.However, the environments of dialogue translation sys-tems, in which both actual writers and readers are avail-able at the time of translation, are much better than tex.tual translation.
The readers can ask questions directly592to the writers in order to get necessary inforn|ation, whenthey cannot get it from the translated messages or whcttthey cannot understand the translations.Furthermore, the translation system can also pose ques-tions to the writers (senders of messages) to clarify theirintentions.
We can expect an intelligent ranslation sys-tem to play a role of a coordinator of conversations bykeeping track of exchanges of important in/srma~ion be-tween dialogue participants (see Fig.a).\[EX 41\[English participant\] In which region do youwant to stay in Tokyo ?\[Japai, ese participant\] disuko~ni ikitai.
(1 wouldlike to go to disdotheqne)\[System's Question to the participant\] shitsumon-.ha anata-no kibou-suru hoteru-no basho desu?
(The question is 'in which resgion do youwant to stay in Tokyo ?'.
Would you specifythe place which you prefer to stay ?
)\[Japanese participant\] disuko-ni ehikai hoteru-desu.
(A hotel near to a discotheque)\[Translated reply to the English participant\] 1prefer to stay a hotel near to a discotheque.Note also that what is important in dialogue transla-tion is the exchange of information through translationbut not translated texts obtained as the result.
Transla..tions are satisfactory when the participants achieve theirgoals, even if they are awkward.
On the contrary, in tex-tual translation, translated texts themselves are impor-tant and they should be natural and cleat' enough in allaspects, because different readers with different intentionwill read them and be interested in different aspects ofinformtional conteflts of same texts.6 ConclusionsWe discussed in this paper the difl'erences of dialoguetranslation systems and textual translation systerns.
Es-pecially, we emphasized the differences of environmentswhere these two types of systems will be used, and dis.cussed what implications the differences have in the &>sign of feasible dialogue transla\[ion systems.
The maindifferences are:Clear Definition of Information in Dialogue 3.?ans-lationActive Participations of Speakers and tlearers in Di-alogue 'lYanslationWe argued that, if they are properly designed to takethese adval,tages ofdialogue translation, dialogue transla.-tion systems can be more feasible than textuM translationsystems.
F,.~p(x~ially, we proposed a new approach to MT,called interpretation based approach, in which an explicitlayer of uude'rslanding is introduced and parts of utter.-~nees conveying importanl information are inte~7)reled bybeing related to this layer.Though the approach produces le~s siructure bou'adtranslations through understanding and paraphrasing, itis different fi:om the conventional pivot or interlingual ap-proach which claims their understanding results can berepresented in the lbrms which are independent on bothindividual hmguages and tasks.
Tim mtderstauding layerin the proposed approach, on the other hand, is languageuniversal but highly dependent on specific tasks of dia-logues.
In the proposed approach, we have to design mlinternM meaning representation specific to the domain ofthe dialogues.The k)llowings are important in order to develop ati~'asible dialogue translation system based on the inter-pretation based approach.o httegration of different layers of descril)tions: Wehave to devise technologies for integrating the d(.
~scriptions of the understanding layer and the con-venti,)nal structural descriptions of source sentencesto produce translations, because single utterancesgenerally consist of the parts which convey impor-tant information and those which do not.
The ideaof sally net should be re-considered in this new con-text.Flexible interaction during translation: 2?aditionalpost- and pre-editings by human are not the bestway lo take the advantage of the availability of speak-ers and hearers in dialogue translation.
We haveto design much flexible interaction modes includingclarificalion dialogues between the system and thedialogue participants.?
Management of dialogue strnctnres: ht order to findimporlant information, a system should have theability of managing the dialogue sturutures.
It shouldbe able to utilize various kinds of knowledge suchas knowledge about surface clue expressions, taskdepeadent knowledge, discourse structures, etc.
torecover the struetnres of omgoing dialogue.
Espe-dally, a translation system as a coordinator of con-vers0.tions has to keep track of importanl informa..lion exchanges through sequences of utterances.AcknowledgementThe authors are grateful to the members of the studygroup on Spoken Dialogue at ATR.
