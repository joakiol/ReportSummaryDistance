As an important Chineselanguage resource, our idiom knowledgebase will play a major role in applicationssuch as linguistic research, teachingChinese as a foreign language and even asa tool for preserving this non-materialChinese cultural and historical heritage.1  IntroductionAn idiom is a multi-word expression that has afigurative meaning that is comprehended inregard to a common use of that expression thatis separate from the literal meaning or definitionof the words of which it is made (McArthur,1992).
From a linguistic perspective, idioms areusually presumed to be figures of speech thatare contradictory to the principle ofcompositionality.
The words that construct anidiom no longer keep their original meaning orpopular sense, while in the process of itsformation it develops a specialized meaning asan entity whose sense is different from theliteral meanings of the constituent elements.Although an idiom is an expression notreadily analyzable from its grammaticalstructure or from the meaning of its componentwords, it is the distinctive form or constructionof a particular language that has a unique formor style characteristic only of that language.
Anidiom is also used, in most cases, with someintention of the writer or to express certainemotion or attitude.
Thus in nature, idioms areexaggerative and descriptive and do not belongto the plain type.Therefore, to classify idioms according toits emotional property or descriptive property isimportant for many practical applications.
Inrecent years, emotion classification has becomea very popular task in the area of NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP), which tries topredict sentiment (opinion, emotion, etc.)
fromtexts.
Most research has focused on subjectivity(subjective/objective) or polarity(positive/neutral/negative) classification.
Theapplications with this respect include human ormachine translation, automatic textclassification or Teaching Chinese as a ForeignLanguage (TCFL).
For example, when a studentlearning Chinese as a foreign languageencounters an idiom in his or her reading orconversation, for better understanding it isimportant for him or her to know whether theidiom is used to indicate an appreciative orderogatory sense which is very crucial tounderstand the attitude of the idiom user.Another example is that long articles aboutpolitics in newspapers often include a lot ofidiom usage to boost their expressiveness andthese idioms may carry emotional information.Obviously by knowing the emotionalinclination we may easily obtain a clue aboutthe general attitude of the particular medium.We may even be able to detect or monitorautomatically the possible hostile attitude fromcertain electronic media which today provide sohuge amount of information that seems hard forhuman processing on a daily basis.The rest of this paper is organized asfollows.
Section 2 describes the construction of11a Chinese Idiom Knowledge Base (CIKB) andintroduces its several applications so far.Section 3 concludes the related work that servesas the basis of the building of CIKB and theemotion classification experiment introduced inthis paper.
Section 4 describes the classificationmethod, feature settings, the process of emotionclassification and the analysis of the result.Section 5 includes conclusions and our futurework.2 Chinese Idioms and Chinese IdiomKnowledge BaseGenerally an idiom is a metaphor ?
a termrequiring some background knowledge,contextual information, or cultural experience,mostly to use only within a particular language,where conversational parties must possesscommon cultural references.
Therefore, idiomsare not considered part of the language, but partof a nation?s history, society or culture.
Asculture typically is localized, idioms often canonly be understood within the same culturalbackground; nevertheless, this is not a definiterule because some idioms can overcomecultural barriers and easily be translated acrosslanguages, and their metaphoric meanings canstill be deduced.
Contrary to commonknowledge that language is a living thing,idioms do not readily change as time passes.Some idioms gain and lose favor in popularliterature or speeches, but they rarely have anyactual shift in their constructs as long as they donot become extinct.
In real life, people alsohave a natural tendency to over exaggerate whatthey mean or over describe what they see orhear sometimes and this gives birth to newidioms by accident.Most Chinese idioms (??
: ch?ng1  y?,literally meaning ?set phrases?)
are derivedfrom ancient literature, especially Chineseclassics, and are widely used in written Chinesetexts.
Some idioms appear in spoken orvernacular Chinese.
The majority of Chineseidioms consist of four characters, but some havefewer or more.
The meaning of an idiomusually surpasses the sum of the meanings1 The marks on the letters in a Pinyin are for the five tonesof Chinese characters.carried by the few characters, as Chinese idiomsare often closely related with the fable, story orhistorical account from which they wereoriginally born.
As their constructs remainstable through history, Chinese idioms do notfollow the usual lexical pattern and syntax ofmodern Chinese language which has beenreformed many a time.
They are instead highlycompact and resemble more ancient Chineselanguage in many linguistic features.Usually a Chinese idiom reflects the moralbehind the story that it is derived.
(Lo, 1997)For example, the idiom ??????
(p?
f?
ch?nzh?u) literally means ?smash the cauldrons andsink the boats.?
It was based on a historicalstory where General Xiang Yu in Qin Dynasty(221 B. C. ?
207 B. C.) ordered his army todestroy all cooking utensils and boats after theycrossed a river into the enemy?s territory.
Heand his men won the battle for their ?life ordeath?
courage and ?no-retreat?
policy.Although there are similar phrases in English,such as ?burning bridges?
or ?crossing theRubicon?, this particular idiom cannot be usedin a losing scenario because the story behind itdoes not indicate a failure.
Another typicalexample is the idiom ??????
(gu?
ti?n l?xi?)
which literally means ?melon field, underthe plum trees?.
Metaphorically it implies asuspicious situation.
Derived from a versecalled ?????
(j?n z?
x?ng, meaning ?AGentleman?s Journey?)
from Eastern HanDynasty (A. D. 25 ?
A. D. 220), the idiom isoriginated from two lines of the poem ?????????????
(gu?
ti?n b?
n?
l?, l?
xi?
b?zh?ng gu?n) which describe a code of conductfor a gentleman that says ?Don't adjust yourshoes in a melon field and don?t tidy your hatunder plum trees?
in order to avoid suspicion ofstealing.
However, most Chinese idioms do notpossess an allusion nature and are just acombination of morphemes that will give thisset phrase phonetic, semantic or formalexpressiveness.
For example, the idiom ??????
(hu?n ti?n x?
d?, metaphorically meaning?be highly delighted?)
literally means ?happyheaven and joyful earth?
; or in the idiom ??????
(l?ng d?ng r?
y?, meaning ?be throwninto the jail?
), the word ????
is just the soundof a prisoner?s fetters.12For the importance of idioms in Chineselanguage and culture, an idiom bank with about6,790 entries were included in the mostinfluential Chinese language knowledge base ?the Grammatical Knowledge base ofContemporary Chinese (GKB) completed bythe Institute of Computational Linguistics atPeking University (ICL), which has beenworking on language resources for over 20years and building many knowledge bases onChinese language.
Based on that, the ChineseIdiom Knowledge Base (CIKB) had beenconstructed from the year 2004 to 2009 andcollects more than 38, 000 idioms with moresemantic and pragmatic properties added.Basically the properties of each entry inCIKB can be classified into four categories:lexical, semantic, syntactic and pragmatic, eachof which also includes several fields in itscontainer -- the SQL database.
Table 1 showsthe details about the fields.Categories PropertiesLexical idiom, Pinyin2, full Pinyin3,bianti4, explanation, originSemantic synonym, antonym, literaltranslation, free translation,English equivalentSyntactic compositionality, syntacticfunctionPragmatic frequency, emotion, event(context), gradeTable 1.
Property categories of CIKB.There are three fields of translation as wecan see in Table 1.
In spite of the fact that a2 Pinyin (?
?, literally ?phonetics?, or more literally,?spelling sound?
or ?spelled sound?
), or more formallyHanyu Pinyin (???
?, Chinese Pinyin), is currently themost commonly used Romanization system for standardMandarin.
The system is now used in mainland China,Hong Kong, Macau, parts of Taiwan, Malaysia andSingapore to teach Mandarin Chinese and internationallyto teach Mandarin as a second language.
It is also oftenused to spell Chinese names in foreign publications andcan be used to enter Chinese characters on computers andcell phones.3 full Pinyin, a form of Pinyin that replaces the tone markswith numbers 1 to 5 to indicate the five tones of Chinesecharacters for the convenience of computer processing.4 bianti, a variant form of the idiom that was caused byrandom misuse, literary malapropism, etc.literal translation of an idiom will not reflect itsmetaphorical meaning generally, it will still beof value to those who expect to get familiarwith the constituent characters and may want toconnect its literal meaning with its metaphoricalmeaning, especially for those learners ofChinese as a foreign language.Figure 1.
The hierarchical structure of CIKB.The idioms are classified into three gradesin terms of appearance in texts and complexityof annotation.
The most commonly used 3,000idioms serve as the core idioms based on thestatistics obtained from the corpus of People?sDaily (the year of 1998), a newspaper that hasthe largest circulation in China.
Another 11,000idioms are selected into a category named asbasic idioms (fully annotated in every field) andthe total 38,117 forms the whole knowledgebase.
Its hierarchical structure can be seen inFigure 1.The syntactic category aims at NLP taskslike automatic identification or machinetranslation.
Compared with English idioms, theidentification of Chinese idioms is not sodifficult for its fossilized structure, i.e.continuity in a text.
To build a lexicon likeCIKB will complete the task successfully.
Asfor machine translation, however, it iscompletely another story because thecompositional complexity of Chinese idiomsenables them to function as different syntacticconstituents with variable part-of-speech (POS).We classify them into nine categories accordingto its compositional relations of the morphemesand into seven categories according to itssyntactic functions that they may serve in asentence, as is shown in Table 2.CIKB 38,117Basic 11,000Core 3,00013No.

Compositionality and syntactic functions of idioms.Upon the completion of CIKB, a fewresearch projects have been conducted toinvestigate possible applications.
Li (2006)investigates the frequency and formation ofidiom usage in People?s Daily and Wang (2010)selects 1,000 popular idioms from CIKB tocompile a book for Chinese learners.
On thebasis of CIKB, we also made a couple ofattempts on the automatic classification ofidioms to identify the token-level characteristicsof an idiom.
This paper will focus on theemotion classification of idioms with machinelearning method and the work will be elaboratedin section 4.
Here we define the emotion typesas ?appreciative (A)?, ?derogatory (D)?
and?neutral (N)?.3 Related Work on Idiom KnowledgeBase and Its ApplicationsThere has not been much work on theconstruction of an idiom corpus or an idiomknowledge base.
With this respect, Birke andSarkar (2006) and Fellbaum (2007) areexceptions.
Birke and Sarkar (2006) constructeda corpus of English idiomatic expressions withautomatic method.
They selected 50 expressionsand collected about 6,600 examples.
They callthe corpus TroFi Example Base, which isavailable on the Web.As far as idiom identification is concerned,the work is classified into two kinds : one is foridiom types and the other is for idiom tokens.With the former, phrases that can be interpretedas idioms are found in text corpora, typically forlexicographers to compile idiom dictionaries.Previous studies have mostly focused on theidiom type identification (Lin, 1999; Baldwin etal., 2003; Shudo et al, 2004).
However, therehas been a growing interest in idiom tokenidentification recently (Katz and Giesbrecht,2006; Hashimoto et al, 2006; Cook et al , 2007).Our work elaborated in section 4 is also anattempt in this regard.Despite the recent enthusiasm formultiword expressions, the idiom tokenidentification is in an early stage of itsdevelopment.
Given that many languageteaching and learning tasks like TCFL have beendeveloped as a result of the availability oflanguage resources, idiom token identificationshould also be developed when adequate idiomresources are provided.
To this end, we haveconstructed the CIKB and hope to findapplications of value, for example, emotionclassification, event classification and textanalysis based on idiom usage and its context.According to the granularity of text,emotion analysis of texts can be divided intothree levels: text (Pang et al, 2002; Cui et al,2006), sentence (Pang et al, 2004), word(Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1997; Wiebe 2000).According to the sources of emotion prediction,classification methods can be divided intoknowledge based methods and machine learningbased methods.
The former uses lexicons orknowledge bases to build a new lexicon thatcontains emotion words.
WordNet is often usedto compute the emotion prediction of words(Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1997; Andrea 2005).Meanwhile, incorporating knowledge into themachine learning architecture as features is apopular trend and untagged copra are often usedto do emotion classification research (Turney etal., 2002; Akkaya et al, 2009).144 An NLP Application of EmotionClassification on CIKBIn this paper, we focus on the emotion predictionof idioms conducted by machine learningmethod.
To do this, we aim to investigate howthe compositional constituents of an idiom affectits emotion orientation from the token level,especially for multi-word expressions with soobvious an exaggerative and descriptive naturelike idioms.
From CIKB, 20,000 idioms areselected as the training corpus and 3,000 idiomsas the test corpus.
The detailed distribution ofidioms in each emotion group is shown in Table3.
We can see that neutral has the largest numberof idioms, accounting for 41.08% and 36.67% inthe training and test corpus respectively, butthere is not a big difference between groups.Training corpus Test corpusnumber percentage number PercentageAppreciative(A) 6967 34.84% 1011 33.70%Neutral(N) 8216 41.08% 1100 36.67%Derogatory(D) 4817 24.08% 889 29.63%Table 3.
The distribution of idioms in each emotion group.Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortesand Vapnik, 1995) is adopted as theclassification method to predict emotions inidioms.
LIBLINEAR (Fan et al, 2008), alibrary for large SVM linear classification, isused for implementation.
The solver is set beL2-loss SVM dual.
Parameter C is set to be 2-5.Three classes of features and their variouscombinations are examined and used, includingChinese characters, words and part-of-speeches.Detailed features and related abbreviations areshown as in Table 4.Because Chinese sentences are written ina consecutive string of characters, we need tosegment a sentence into individual words toobtain the word feature.
ICTCLAS (Zhang etal., 2003), a tool developed by the Institute ofComputing Technology of Chinese Academyof Sciences (ICT), is used for wordsegmentation and part-of-speech tagging.
Weadopt precision, recall and F-score (?=1) as theevaluation parameters.
From Table 5 we cansee that i_cb has a better performance than i_cu,which indicates that a bigram model usuallyperforms better than a unigram model.
Butwhen we segment the idioms and use i_wu, wefind that the performance gets bad.
This maybe because the compositionality of Chineseidioms is quite fossilized and the errors causedby segmentation introduce some noise.Features and their abbreviations Idiom(i) Explanation(e)Chinese characters character unigram(i_cu, e_cu) ?5 ?character bigram(i_cb, e_cb) ?
?Words word unigram(i_wu, e_wu) ?
?word bigram(i_wb, e_wu) ?
?Word/part-of-speech word/pos unigram(i_wpu, e_wpu) ?
?word/pos bigram(i_wpb, e_wpb) ?
?Table 4.
Features selected for emotion prediction.5 ???
indicates  the feature is selected while ???
indicates the feature is not selected.15We want to know whether we will have abetter performance if we add more featuresfrom the other fields of CIKB.
Obviously themost relevant feature will be the explanation ofan idiom.
Therefore we add the texts in theexplanation field as features in the experiment.We find that by adding more features from theexplanation field, the performance doesimprove.
But when the POS feature isintroduced, the performance gets bad.
This maybe because as Chinese idioms keepgrammatical properties of ancient Chineselanguage and its POS is very different from thesetting of the tool designed primarily formodern Chinese, more noise is introduced byusing POS here.
Finally we can see that thecombination i_cu+i_cb+e_wu+e_wb achievesthe best performance in both Chinese characterfeatures and word features.Most importantly, we notice that althoughfor idioms themselves segmentation does notaffect the performance in a positive way,segmentation of the explanations does improvethe performance.
Thus we may conclude thatthe compositionality of an idiom is verydifferent from its explanation which is writtenin modern Chinese while the idiom itself is stillcharacter-based and keeps its originalmorphemes that are inherited from ancientChinese language.Features or featurescombinedResultPrecision Recall F-scorei_cu 63.23% 75.16% 68.68%i_cb 65.78% 78.24% 71.47%i_wu 62.51% 73.42% 68.35%i_wpu 60.03% 71.89% 65.43%i_cu+e_wu 66.40% 80.05% 72.59%i_cu+e_wpu 65.68% 77.95% 71.29%i_cu+e_wb 65.08% 76.14% 70.18%I_cu+i_cb 67.33% 80.82% 73.46%i_cu+i_cb+e_wu 68.55% 81.37% 74.41%i_cu+i_cb+e_wu+e_wb  70.18% 82.71% 75.93%Table 5.

One application ?
theemotion classification of idioms ?
waselaborated to show our effort in exploring thetoken-level characteristics of Chinese idioms.Therefore we select a number of idioms fromCIKB to classify them into three emotiongroups.
SVM is employed for automaticclassification.
Three classes of features areexamined and experiments show that certainfeature combinations achieve goodperformance.
The learning curve indicates thatperformance may be further improved with theincrease of training data size.Now we also hope to classify the idiomsinto categories according to their usage incontext, i.e., under what circumstances they areoften used (event classification).
Variouslinguistic features and real-world knowledgewill be considered to incorporate into themachine learning classifier to improveclassification result.
The work is in progressand we hope the emotion classification and theevent classification will be compared todetermine their underlining relations and hopethat more applications can be found in ourfuture work based on CIKB.AcknowledgementsThe work in this paper is supported by a grantfrom the 973 National Basic Research Programof China (No.
