eduAbstractA large corpus (about 100 MB of text)was selected and examples of 750 fl'e-quently occurring verbs were tagged withtheir compleinent (:lass as defined by alarge computational syntactic dictionary,COMLEX Syntax.
This tagging taskled to the refinement of already exist-ing classes and to the addition of classesthat had previously not been defined.This has resulted in the enrichment andimprovement of the original COMLEXSyntax dictionary.
Tagging also providesstatistical data which will allow users toselect, more common complelnents of aparticular verb and ignore rare usage.We discuss below some of the problemsencountered in tagging and their resolu-tion.1 Introduct ionCOMLEX Syntax is a moderately-broad-coverageEnglish lexicon (with about 38,000 root; forms) de-veloped at New York University under contract othe Linguistic Data Consortium; the first versionof the lexicon was delivered in May 1994.
Thetagged version was delivered in August 1995.
Theh;xicon is available to members of the LinguisticData Consortium for both research and commer-cial applications.
It was developed specifically foruse in processing natural anguage by computer.COMLEX Syntax is particularly detailed inits treatment of subeategorization (cotnplementstructures).
It includes 92 different subcategoriza-tion features for verbs, 14 for adjectives, and 9for nouns.
These distinguish not only the (lifter-ent constituent structures which may appear in acomplement, but also the different control featuresassociated with a constituent structure.In order to make this dictionary useful to theentire Natural Language Processing coinmunity,an effort was made to provide detailed yet the-ory neutral syntactic information.
In part, thisinvolved using categories that are generally recog-nized, i.e.
norms, verbs, adjectives, prepositions,adverbs, and their corresponding phrasal expan-sions np, vp, adjp, pp, advp.
COMLEX citesthe specific: prepositions and adverbs hi preposi-tional anti particle phrases associated with partic-ular verbs.
1As a starting point, the classes for complementsand features developed by the New York Univer-sity Linguistic String Project (LSP) (Fitzpatrick,1981), were selected sin(x, the coverage is verybroad and the classes well defined.
These classeswere augmented and flnther refined by studyingthe coding employed by several other major lexi-cons used for automated language analysis.
TheOxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD)(Hornby, 1980), the Longman Dictionary of Con-temporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor, 1978), theverb (:odes developed for English by Sanfilippo aspart of the ACQUILEX project(Sanfilippo, 1992),and The Brandeis Verb Lexicon 2 were consulted.A Brandeis-like notation was adopted for COM-I,EX complement naines.
The Brandeis nota-tion is compositional, consisting of lists of ele-ments joined by hyphens e.g.
pl-ing-sc (preposi-tion "about" followed by a gerund where tile ma-trix subject is the subject of the gerund e.g.
"helied about going").
In adapting this notation forCOMLEX, the list of complement nmnes becamefixed and a separate xplicit definition of tile syn-tactic structure associated with each complementname was provided.
I,hrther information on theseclasses and definitions can be found in the Refer-ence Manual (Macleod, 1993) and the COMLEXWord Classes Manual (Wolff', 1995).2 Tagging TaskWe tagged 100 exmnples for each of 750 commonverbs which had previously been entered in theCOMLEX lexicon.
These tags, which becmne partof the dictionary entry, contain tile location of theexample and the name of the w~'rbal complementidentified at that location (see figure 1 for a sample1e.g.
pp :pval "to" for he went to the party; part-np:adval "up" for he woke up the child.~Developed by J. Grimshaw and R. Jackendoff.472tagged entry).
The original motivation lot taggingwas l,wofold, (1) to gather stadstil:s on the fix>quency of oc(:urrencc of a parti(:ular complementof a verb and (2) 1,o check on COMI3BX (:overag(;,ascertaining @at l,he most {:(mun(mly occurring(',{}mph~meni;s had no|, be(;n (}verl(/oked in tim (}rig-inal cntries.The (:orI)us us(xl for this t;agging {:(resists (ifBrown (all, i.e.

(13) .. School where their delicatetransformation BEGAN.
\[where\]In all the above cases, except for sentence (13)the complement can be unambiguously recovered.In sentence (9) they bought something, in (10)they would agree on the statement, and in (11)he/she has got somettfing on.
However, eventhough "where" is to be reconstructed in both(12) and (13) only in (12) can it be unambigu-ously interpreted as being part of a pp (they werewalking to somewhere); in (13) "where" could beinterpreted as a pp or an advp (it began there/itbegan at school) so we classify it as having theclass "where" (which is not a COMLEX comple-ment).5 Parenthet ica lshlrther "missing" complements were found in par-entheticals.
(14) For example, to move (as the scoreREQUIRES) from the lowest -F-majorregister up to a barely audible ~Nminor in four seconds, not skipping,at the same time, even one of the407 fingerings, seems a feat tooabsurd to consider, and it is tothe flautist's credit that he remain-ed silent throughout the passage.
(15) The ideal home, they AGREED, wouldbe a small private house or a cityapartment of four to five rooms,just enough for a familyReconstructing a TO- INF ~r  "requires" in (14)would not be correct since "require" needs a NP-TO- INF (*the score requires to move), but it isnot clear what the np could be (perhaps "theflautist"?
the tone?).
We felt these cases to bedifferent from the other cases that we have dis-cussed above not only because of the difficulty oflocating the complement but in the nature of theconstruction.
This construction is more similar, infact, to COMLEX's V-SAY feature which allowsa verb like "say" to occur in sentence adjunct po-sitions without its complement, s(16) He sa id ,  " I  want to  see you.
"(17) " I " ,  he sa id ,  "want to  see you.
"(18) " I  want",  he sa id ,  " to see you.
"(19) " I  want to  see you,"  he sa id .Therefore, we concluded that the fact that theseverbs can occur without their complements i afact about the graminar of parentheticals.
Theseexamples, then, have been tagged as "parenthet-ical" and the new COMLEX feature PAREN-THETICAL has been given to the verbs whichcan occur in parentimtical constructions.6 The " In t rans i t i ve"  Quest ionWe have encountered several types of zeroing inthe corpus which occur with verbs which we wouldnormally consider transitive (~or verbs which canbe intransitive only under special circumstances.For example, in isolation, "agree" may not occurintransitively unless it has a plural subject (COM-LEX intrans-recip class).

The doctorAGREED, but explained that itwould be necessary first to checkFred's blood to ascertain whetheror not it was of the same type...We have estat)lished the.

The new COMLEX comple-ment INTRANS-ELLIPSIS is added to verbs ofthis type and therefore COMLEX differentiatesbetween "true" intransitives 9 and eases like theabove.W~ also found occurrences of "hat)itual" intran-sit;ives in the text.
Even verbs which are alwaysconsidered to be transitive, like "hit" for example,can be used intransitively if the action is consid-ered to be habitual.

(29) She always abbreviates,a very annoying habit.

*He put the stakes the table.

A number of verbs take very particularnoun phrases.
Verbs like "increase", "decrease"and "expand" take complement groups which re-quire a noun with the subclass NUNIT.
~2 Theseverbs occurred t)redoIninately in environments likeThe pr i ce  inc reased  5 to  :tO percent .The price increased 5 dollars a share.We decided not to make this a separate NP coni-plement for several reasons: (1) these verl)s alsotake regular NP complements, though in some in-stances (as in the below example) the meaning ofthe verb changc.s.
As COMLEX does not sensedisambiguate the semantic difference does not af~feet the dictionary entry.
"Those vitamins increased his appetite.
"(2)the NUNITPs are not syntacticly distin-guished; other nouns occur with similar struc-tures.
"He ate 5 to  :tO p ick les  (a day) .
"On the other hand, the increase-type v rbs canappear with a whole range of nunitp comt)lements(cornpleinents which contain an nunitp 1at:The pr i ce  inc reased  (5Z) to  $10 (a share) .The pr i ce  inc reased  (SY,) from $10 (a share) .The pr i ce  inc reased  from $10 (a share)  to$30 (a share) .The price increased to 30 dollars from i0dollars.The price increased by 5Z to end at $i00.whereas verbs like "eat" can not*He ate to / f rom 10 p ick les .
*He ate by 10~ to  20 p ick les  (a day) .Mthough we decided not to add NUNITP asa separate NP complement, we have let theNUNITP tags for verb complements remain, to re-flect the information that in our corpus this typet~These art'.

Wc have added a separate frame group withthe name NUNITP-TO-I{ANGE which includesthe conq)leinents mentioned abow~'.
Although, itis called NUNITP to underline the fact that or-dinarily the nouns that occur are NUNITs or at'('.coerced into being NUNITs in this structure ~4, the.NPs are not formally distinguished as such in thenotation of the fl'ame group.
The fact (hal; thesenoun phrases, and the NADVPs above, behave ina manner distinct Dom other NPs is recognizedand discussed in Ross's paper on Defective NounPhrases (Ross, 1995)9 Tagg ing  Improves  COMLEXAside fl'om presenting these interesting and llil-expected phenomena, tagging has tightened ut)the classification of some coml)lements, leadingin the direction of combining some complementsghat had been separate and re-grouping oth-ers.
COMLGX had a frame-group which classi-fie<l together a number of wh-comt)lements.
Nowthere is a different grouping with the original"whether"/" i f" /"what" (WIt-S comt)lement) and"how" (HOW-S, PI ' -HOW-TO-INF) augmentedby "where"/"when" / "how much" / "how Inany"(WHERE-WHEN-S).
This last; group was estM>lished for verbs like "define" and "forecast" whichdo not take members of the original fi'ame groups.
