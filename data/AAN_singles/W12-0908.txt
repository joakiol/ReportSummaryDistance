It has actually been proposedthat language provides a rich source of information that blind subjects can exploit to acquire aspectsof word meaning that are related to visual experience, such as the color of fruits or animals.
Despitethis, whether and how sensory deprivation affects the structure of semantic representations is still anopen question.
In this talk, we present a new, freely available collection of feature norms produced bycongenital blind subjects and normal sighted people.
Subjects were asked to produce semantic featuresdescribing the meaning of concrete and abstract nouns and verbs.
Data were collected from Italiansubjects, translated into English, and categorized with respect to their semantic type (e.g.
hypernym,meronym, physical property, etc.).
First analyses of the feature norms highlight important differencesbetween blind and sighted subjects, for instance for the role of color and other visual features in theproduced semantic descriptions.
This resource can provide new evidence on the role of perceptualexperience in shaping concepts, as well as on its interplay with information extracted from linguisticdata.
The norms will also be used to carry out computational experiments with distributional semanticmodels to simulate blind and sighted semantic spaces.32
