1A problem to be confronted when trying to de-velop such tools is the lack of universally agreedupon coding schemes for these 'levels'~-i.e., ofspeci-fications of a set of elements and attributes that willcover all of the information about that level that aresearcher may wish to annotate, together with in-structions for how to do so.
What does exist at themoment is coding schemes for particular domainsand/or applications: in the case of dialogue acts,for example, there are several 'specific' schemes forgiven applications, ome of which have been shownto lead to reliable coding (Alexandersson etal., 1997;Carletta et al, 1997).
Recently, attempts to comeup with standards for a few of these levels have beenmade at workshops organized by the Discourse Re-source Initiative (DRI).
The DRI did come up witha proposal concerning the dialogue act level (Dis-course Resource Initiative, 1997; Allen and Core,1997), although there have been serious disagree-ments concerning the usefulness of such a 'standard'for this level, since it's not clear that it's possibleto come up with a domain-independent definition ofdialogue acts.
No official recommendation has beenmade in the DRI for the so-called 'coreference' l vel,although the DRAMA scheme (Passonneau, 1997) hassometimes been discussed for this purpose.In this paper we report on the current proposalconcerning the type of 'coreference' annotation tobe supported by the MATE workbench, motivatingour proposal by relation to previous proposals intThe project's home page is athttp ://mate.

ukl'poesio/MATE/coreference_scheme.html.2 Annotating for 'Coreference'2.1 Problems to be addressedThe difficulties to be addressed in the case of the'coreference' level are of a different nature from thosethat arise in the case of the other annotation task atthe semantic level considered in MATE, the dialogueacts level.A very basic problem arising in the case of coref-erence is deciding what type of information is beingannotated, since the term 'coreference' is used toindicate different things.
The name 'coreference' de-rives from the task of 'coreference resolution', oneof the semantic interpretation tasks adopted in theMessage Understanding Conference (MUC), a US ini-tiative to evaluate systems performing informationextraction.
The coreference annotation scheme usedin MUC-7, MUCCS (Hirschman, 1997) was devisedto evaluate the ability of the systems participat-ing in the competition to identify which elementsin the text referred to the same object; hence theterm 'coreference'.
The scheme adopted for anno-tating references to landmarks in the MapTask cor-pus is also meant to annotate reference in this sense.Both the DRAMA scheme and the schemes proposedby Lancaster University (Fligelstone, 1992), instead,are meant to be use(!
to annotate anaphoric infor-mation in texts; but coreference is not the sameas anaphoricity.
Two NPS can corefer without ei-ther of them being 'anaphoric' in the traditionalsense -e.g., proper names are not generally consid-ered 'anaphoric expressions', yet two proper namescan obviously corefer, as in (la); and conversely, twoNPs can be in an anaphoric relation without eitherof them 'referring' to anything, ms in (lb), where oneof the engines at Elmira doesn't really refer to anyspecific engine yet serves as antecedent of that.
(See65(van Deemter and Kibble, 1999) for further discus-sion.)
Fortunately for our purposes, coreference in-formation can be expressed using the relations usedto express anaphoric information, which makes itpossible to develop schemes in which both typesof information can be encoded, as we will see be-low.
We will keep referring to the markup level withwhich we are concerned as 'coreference' for consis-tency with common use, but the reader should usethe term with care.

So, the main problem the designer of sucha scheme has to confront is the sheer pervasive-ness of the phenomenon: almost every word in acoherent ext-including quantifiers, nouns, (modal)verbs, and adjectives-can be said to be anaphori-cally related in some way to what has already beenintroduced in the text, as shown by the followingexamples.
This means that, in practice, it will al-ways be necessary to restrict somehow the amountof anaphoric information to annotate.
(See also thediscussion in (Hirschman, 1997).

thananyone lse.A second problem is that we do not know yet whatcan be annotated reliably and what cannot.
In theirreliability study, (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) found afair agreement among annotators (K = .76) con-cerning which NPS were anaphoric and which oneswere not, and about 95% agreement on antecedentsfor those definite descriptions that all subjects idea-tiffed as anaphoric; but no agreement on identif.v-ing bridging references (K=.24), and often differentantecedents were indicated for those that all anno-tators classified as bridges.
3 As a result, the onlycoding scheme whose reliability has been extensivelytested is MUCCS.2.2 Existing schemesThe MUCCS scheme (Hirschman, 1997) is the mostwidely used of the existing coreference schemes, andalso the more modest in scope: it concentrates onidentity relations between NPs.
The nlain l>roblemwith MUCCS from our point of view is that it was de-signed for texts, so it does not provide instructionseither for dealing with typical problems in dialoguesuch as disfluencies, or for annotating references tothe visual situation, common e.g., in the MapTaskcorpus and in multimodal applications, and that wehypothesize can be reliably annotated (although thishyppthesis will have to be verified).
Also, it's onlydesigned for English, and therefore does not includeinstructions for anaphoric expressions common inother European languages and whose relation withother discourse ntities could be annotated reliably,such as clitics.The DRAMA scheme (Passonneau, 1997) does in-clude instructions for dealing with some difficultproblems of markable identification i  dialogues, butnot for multilingual annotation.
DRAMA includes in-structions for annotating bridging references (whosereliability, however, still has to be ascertained), butnot for references to the visual situation.
Thescheme proposed by (Bruneseanx and Romary, 1998)provides markup elements (based on the TEI scheme)to annotate both references to the visual situationand discourse deixis, in addition to bridging refer-ences; the reliability of this type of annotatiou was-n't evaluated.
The Lancaster scheme (Fligelstone,1992) was also designed for texts, and in certain waysis more ambitious than any of the schemes discussed3Informal studies conducted in MUC and by the uR1confirm this (Discourse Resource Initiative, 1997).
Theparticipants o these initiatives found reasonable agree-ment on the antecedents of anaphoric expressions, butpoor recall for bridges.
These results led to the elimi-nation of relations other than IDENT from the r,u)C cod-ing scheme for coreference, MUCCS.
Those studies alsosuggest hat one way to improve reliability on bridgesmay be to use better tools suggesting relations.
Also~using a smaller number of relations may help, but theactual number of anaphoric elements annotated was notindicated so it's not clear whether this result is actuall.vsignificant.mmmmm\[\]mmmm\[\]unmmmnmmmmmRm66here in that it also contains instructions for anno-tating elliptical references.
We are not aware of anyresults about the reliability of the scheme.3 The MATE Proposal3.1 Approach:  A Meta  Scheme and TwoInstantiationsIt should be clear from the considerations above thatwe do not believe that there is such a thing as auniversally useful standard for 'coreference' annota-tion in dialogues.
At the same time, because thesemantics of anaphora nd coreference is relativelywell-understood, it is possible to extract from theschemes discussed above a fairly short list of optionsavailable to the designer of a scheme.
(This is unlikethe case of dialogue acts, where different schemesare very difficult to compare.)
These considerationssuggested a 'meta-scheme' approach to the goal ofdeveloping a scheme for the coreference l vel thatcould be useful for different types of applications.What this means is that instead of proposing a sin-gle scheme, we identified a range of possible types ofinformation about 'coreference' one may want to an-notate, on the basis of the coding schemes for coref-erence discussed above; we evaluated how reliableeach type of annotation is likely to be; and we spec-ified the markup language needed to pursue eachoption.
4The meta scheme consists of a CORE SCHEME andthree extensions.
The core scheme can be used todo the type of annotation that can be done withMUCCS (i.e., identity relations between discourse n-tities introduced by NPb).
The three extensions tothe core scheme can be used to annotate (i) refer-ences to the visual situation, as in the Bruneseauxand Romary scheme and in the MapTask scheme forannotating references to landmarks; (ii) a more com-plex set of relations between entities ('bridges'), as inthe DRAMA scheme; and (iii) anaphoric relations in-volving an extended range of anaphoric expressions(such as incorporated clitics) and of antecedents (asin discourse deixis).
The tool will support he wholermlge of elements and attributes of the meta scheme;the task of the designer of a scheme for a particularapplication will be to identify the options of inter-est among those supported by the tool, ignoring therest.
The documentation for the coreference l velincludes, in additions to a discussion of the corescheme and the extensions, an example of how toextract a scheme from the meta scheme (the exam-4The 'meta-scheme' approach was also adopted inEAGLES ht~p ://www.

This is done by in-troducing in the annotation identifiers that standfor the 'actual' referents, and expressing referenceby means of relations between the discourse ntitiesthat 'refer' and these identifiers.3.2 Markup Language and AssumptionsAbout File OrganizationIn the rest of the paper we discuss first the CoreScheme, then each of the extensions.
In this sectionwe introduce the markup language and discuss a fewassumptions underlying annotation using the MATEWorkbench common to several evels, as well as afew assumptions specific to the coreference l vel.The markup language in MATE is XML, a simplifi-cation of SGML meant o make for easier parsing, butthe workbench will make this transparent to annota-tors (not to annotation scheme designers, of course).An assumption common to most levels is the distinc-tion between BASE FILE and ANNOTATION FILE.
Thebase file contains the information ecessary to anno-tate; the results of the annotation for a given level goin a separate file containing pointers to elements ofthe base file.
For the coreference l vel, for example,the base file could be either a file annotated withone XML element per word, as in the British Na-tional Corpus, or possibly a file containing syntacticinformation; in the latter case, the text elements tobe annotated could be identified automatically.We assume here that the base file is encoded ac-cording to the recommendations for the morpho-syntactic level of chunks adopted in MATE (Pirrelliand Soria, 1999), which specify a type of syntac-tic representation that could be produced by ex-isting parsers; such parsers might be integrated inthe workbench.
For example, the representation iterms of chunks of the sentence John likes Bill wouldbe as follows:(3) ~h.~l<ch idffi"ch_O01" type="N"><potgov id="p O01">John</potgov><Ich>67<cA id="ch_002" type="V"><potgov id="p_002">likes </potgov></cA> :<cA id="ch_003" type="N"><potgov id="p_003">Bill </potgov></cA>The result of an annotation at the coreference l velof the file ch.xml (the base file) would be to pro-duce a second file containing elements that point tocA.
xml, as discussed below.4 The  Core  SchememThe Core Scheme has been designed to annotate thesubset of all information about 'coreference' that canbe annotated reliably: that is, information aboutidentity relations between discourse ntities explic-itly introduced by elements of a text.
As in MUCCS,it is assumed that annotation will proceed in twosteps: first agreeing on the markables, then markupof anaphoric relations.
The main difference 'from theMUC scheme is that following the recommendationsof the Text Encoding Initiative and of Bruneseauxand Romary, the distinction between these two stepsof annotation is mirrored in the Core Scheme bya distinction between two elements: <de>,, used tomark the parts of text that may be involved in theserelations, and <link>, used to mark informationabout these relations.4.1 Identifying and Mark ing  Discourse 'EntitiesAs mentioned above, the main problem with design-ing a scheme for anaphora nd coreference is notthat the relevazlt notions are difficult to define, butthat you can't annotate verything.
Of ghe schemeswe examined, the Lancaster University is the mostambitious, including also ways for annotating vP el-lipsis.
DRAMA recommends to annotate all nounphrases, whether or not they introduce discourse'en-tities.
MUCCS recommends to annotate also nounphrases Occurring in prenominal position in othernoun phrases, such as Getty in the Getty museum.For the Core Scheme we adopted a conservativeview close to that of DRAMA, and only recommendto mark the potential antecedents of anaphoric andreferential expressions that are realized in the textas full NPS; in other words, we did not include in-structions for annotating parts of NPS that may en-ter in such relations (as in Muccs) and for annotat-ing verbal constituents hat enter e.g., in ellipsis (asin the Lancaster scheme).
If needed, elements formarking up verbal constituents are included in oneof the extensions of the Core Scheme (see below), sothe MATE Workbench could be used to support histype of annotation, as wellprovided that the userscome up with their own instructions for identifyingthe markables.Each markable NP is annotated with a <de> ele-ment with an ID attribute.
In the underlying XMLrepresentation, the <de> elements include pointersto elements in the base file; e.g., the marl~bles inthe example in (3)'would be represented as follows:(4) .... f. xml<de id="de_O01" href="ch.xml#id(ch_O01)"/><de id="de 002 ' href=" ch.xml#id(ch_O03)"/>However, this aspect of the representation should betransparent to the annotator, who will only be ('on-cerned with marking <de> elements and assigningthem an ID.
SO in what follows, also to make thenotation more readable, we will represent markupusing a simpler notation without HREF pointers, asin the following examples:(5) <de ID="de_Ol">we</de>'re gonna take<de ID="de_OT">the engine E3</de>and shove <de ID="de_08"> it </de> overto <de ID="de_O2">Corning</de>,hook <de ID="de_09"> it </de> up to<de ID="de_O3">the tanker car</de>...(6) .

This suggests that the markables wouldbe mostly identified on purely structural grounds.The instructions for identifying markables do includehowever a discussion of several cases in wlfich the de-signers of a scheme may decide not to mark a textelement as <de> even if syntactically it counts as aNP: examples are NPS in predicative position, such asa policeman in John is a policeman 5, and repeatedNPs in the case of disfluencies, as in the followingexample:(7) 193 F: Doric qu'est ce qui /qu'est ce qui serait commun a5Note that the pronoun he in the contimlation Hcworks for the 27th district would not be con,~ideredambiguous.68<de>ces deux fusees</de>.<de>Ces deux fusees</de> ont /194 D: c'est qu'elles ont /<de>elles</de> ont la meme /elles / elles / routes les /tousles ailerons(in cases like this, DRAMA recommends to mark upall repetitions of ells, although again, they do notcreate ambiguity).
The instructions for the CoreScheme include a fairly extensive discussion of whichtext constituents count as NPS, whichincorporatesexamples from MUCCS and DRAMA as well as from(Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973).An issue not considered either in MUCCS or inDRAMA is what to do when a discourse entity isnot introduced by a single contiguous prase, but byutterances interrupted by disfluencies or comments,as in (8), where the utterance of the diamond mineis interrupted by an acknowledgment from the fol-lower:(8) GIVER: curving, just curving roundthe diamondFOLLOWER: uh-huhGIVER: mine .

uh-huhWe believe this problem should be addressed at theparsing level by providing ways of representing non-contiguous yntactic elements, as done in the repre-sentation for the morpho-syntactic level proposed inMATE.

In the core scheme,this is the only information that can be annotated.Whereas identity relations are represented inMUCCS and DRAMA by means of attributes on el-ements that correspond to the <de> element usedin the MATE scheme, we adopted a notation de-rived from the <link> mechanism used in theTEl for linking any text element and adopted byBruneseaux and Ronmry for representing anaphoricinformation.
6 <link> elements have two attributes:a HREF pointer to the <de> element hat stands in ananaphoric relation with an antecedent, and a TYPEattribute specifying the relation (which in the caseof the Core Scheme can only be IDENT).
<link> ele-ments contain then one or more <anchor> elements,with a single <href> pointer to the antecedent.
Sofor example, the anaphoric relations in (5) and (6)would be annotated as follows:(12).
coref.xml<de ID="de_Ol">we</de>'re gonna take<de ID="de_07"> the engine E3 </de>and shove <de ID="de_08"> it </de> overto <de ID="de_O2">Corning</de>,hook <de ID="de_09"> it </de> up to<de ID="de_O3">the tanker car</de>...<link href=" corer, xml#id (de_07)"type =" ident "><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_08)"/></link><link href="coref, xml#id (de_08)"type =''ident "><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_09)"/></link>(13) coref.xml:197 F: mmh /Donc  qu'est ce que vousallez garder en fair (?)

xJnl#id (de_99)"type="ident"><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de-lO0)"/>6The slightly modified representation f <link>s illour proposal was adopted for technical reasons.69</ l ink>In MUCCS, the annotator is free to choose any of thetwo elements in an identity relation as 'anaphor', be-cause identity is symmetric.
As the intention is touse <link> elements to also annotate non-symmetricrelations such as those found in bridging cases, werecommend to always have the HREF pointer in the<link> element point to the anaphor, and the HREFpointer in the <anchor> to the antecedent.
(In gen-eral, the annotator will still be able to exploit thetransitivity property of identity and choose any an-tecedent, although in particular cases this may notbe a good idea either.
)The reason why <link> elements may have morethan one <anchor> element is to annotate ambigui-ties, which are very common in spoken dialogue.
Incase more than one <de> element appears to be anequally likely antecedent of an anaphoric expression,each of the possibilities hould be marked by meansof a separate <anchor> element.
In (14a), for exam-ple, the pronun it in 15.16 could refer equally wellto engine E3 or the tanker car.
Both antecedentsshould be annotated, as shown in (14b).

The first proposedextension to the Core Scheme consists of a new set ofelements introduced in order to annotate referencesto the visual situation.We adopted for this purpose a variant of the<universe> mechanism used in the Bruneseaux-Romary scheme.
The idea is to assign an ID to eachobject in the visual situation that can be referredto, and then represent references to these objectsby means of the same <link> mechanism used foranaphoric relations in the Core Scheme.
For eachobject in the visual situation, a <ue> element getscreated; the <ue> elements are then grouped in a<universe> element, as follows:(15) ?ore~.,mi:<universe ID="UI"><ue ID="uel"> Diamond mine </ue><ue ID="ue2"> Graveyard </ueY<ue ID="ue3"> Fast rulLning creek </ue><ue ID="ue4"> Feat flowing river </ue><ue ID="ueS"> Canoes </ue></universe>FOLLOWER: Uh-huh.

The<universe> mechanism has been designed to hamdle this type of situations, as well.
hi these cases.it is suggested that three universes be c,'eated: ore,with ID="COMMON" containing all objects shared l)~,-tween the visual situations, and then one univ(,rs(,for each conversational participant containing theelements known only to that participant.
This willensure that the shared elements receive a unique ID.<universe> elements have an optional MODIFIES at-tribute that can be used to encode the informationthat a given universe is an extension of another uni-70verse; e.g., in the case just discussed, tile universeof each participant could be given a value for theMODIFIES= "COMMON".In (161)) we see how the situation in (16a) couldbe encoded.
Three universes are defined; COMMONcontains a gold mine, whereas the GIVER_UNIVERSEalso contains a diamond mine, which isn't in thefollower's universe.
As a result, the follower mistak-euly believes that the gold mine and the dianmndmine are the same.
This example also illustrates howthese misunderstandings could be encoded by ineansof another optional extension to the link mecha-nism specified in the Core Scheme: the attributeWH0-BELIEVES, whose values would be identifiers forthe two participants in the conversation (G and F inthis case).

We are cur-rently doing a test of the reliability of this extensionin two languages (Italian and English) and will re-port, at tile Workshop.6 .
Mark ing  non-nomina l  e lementsEven if we only consider anaphorie relations inwflv-ing nominal elenients, there ark at least two situa-tions in which an aimotator may wish to mark ananaphoric relation that also involves other types ofconstituents.
The first is the case, already men-tioned in Section 4, ill which we have a relation thatwould fall for all purposes under tile Core Scheme,except that the anaphoric elemeut is either iuwx-pressed or incorporated in tile w'rb.
Tile second sit-uation are tile ca.ses of so-called I)ISCOURSE DI,'IXIS(Webber, 1991), when tile anWcedent of n nonfimdexpression is an ahstract Object such as an event orprol)osition introduced in the discourse somewhatindirectly by sentences.
(DJtAMA allows for such r(~-lations to be marked.
)The second extension to the Core ScheIne was de-veloped to give annotators tools to mark these typesof aimphoric relations.
The solution we propose isto use the <seg> element introduced in tile TEl tomark up arbitrary pieces of text; <seg> elements ar('given an ID which can then be used in <link> ,~h,-mcnts just like for other anaphuric relations.
(The<seg> elenmnt couhl also be use(l to extend tile rectas(:heme to cover amq)tmri(: relations betw(:en non-nominal elements, such as vp ellil)sis.
)6.1 Using SEG to mark  up empty  andincorporated  const i tuentsIn Italian, Spanish and Inany other languages, (:at-tain noininal constituents may not be realized; this isespecially conunoil for nominals in subject position.These nonlinals are i)resent in annotations l)ro(lu('(~(l71by hand (e.g., in the Penn Treebank), but the parsersused for parsing spoken dialogues tend not to pro-duce representations containing empty constituentsin this case.
In case these nominals are not rep-resented in the base level, we recommend to markthe verb with a <seg> element, and then code theanaphoric relation as usual by means of <link> ele-ments, as follows:(17) core f .xml :A: Dov'e' <de ID="de_157">Giann i?</de  >\[Where is Gianni?
\ ]B: <seg type="pred"  ID="seg_158 >e'andato a mang iare  </seg>\[.
went to have lunch\]<l ink hre f="core f  .xml#id(seg_158)"type= "ident''><anchor  hre f="core f  .xml#id(de_157)  "/></ l ink>The reader will have noticed that this representationcan only be used without loss of information whenthere is at most one empty elements; this is true forItalian, but not for Japanese or Portuguese.
If moreprecision needed, the annotator should the** definemore specific identity relations also specifying whichempty argument of the verb enters in the anaphoricrelation: SUBJ-IDENT, 0BJ-IDENT~ etc.
These rela-tions could then used instead of IDENT to specify thevalue of the TYPE attribute of the <link> element.A second case in which an argument is not real-ized by means of a nominal is in the case of incor-porated clitics, such as daselo in (11).
In this case,again, we recommend marking the verb by way ofa <seg> element when the parser doesn't producea morphologically decomposed representation, andthen encoding the anaphoric relations in which theclitics are involved by means of either a single IDENTrelation or by means of more fine-grained relationssuch as SUBJ-IDENT or 0BJ-IDENT.

The real question forthis type of annotation is which empty elements toannotate -e.g., in addition to 'small pro' elementssuch as those discussed above, the amlotator mayalso decide to annotate 'big PRO' elements that ac-cording to some syntactic theories occupy the sub-ject position of infinitival clauses.6.2 Using SEG to mark  the antecedents  ofd iscourse deixisAbstract objects such as events, actions and propo-sitions can all serve as antecedents of anaphoric ex-pressions.
We are not aware of any reliability resultsfor this type of annotation, but the <seg> elementcan be used to identify the antecedents in this typeof anaphora.
If desired, the annotator could use asecond attribute TYPE to specify the type of objectintroduced by the <seg> element; TYPE would havevalues EVENT, PROP and ACTION.

The set of relations that may hold betweena bridging reference and its 'antecedent' or 'anchor'is rather wide; an extensive survey of the existingclassifications can be found in (Vieira, 1998).The Extended Relations Scheme is designed forthose who wish to mark up this more generalanaphoric relations.
It uses the same elements asthe Core Scheme, but more values are allowed for theTYPE attribute of the <link> element besides impleIDENT.
The set of relations allowed by the scheme de-rives from the analysis of Vieira and includes mostof the bridging relations in DRAMA (MEMBER, SUBSET,PART, CAUSE, POSS and ARG).
For example, we see in(23) how the elements of the Extended RelationsScheme can be used to encode a subset relation be-tween lee modeles de fusees and lee fusees qui ontbien vole'.

We tried to alleviatethis problem by adopting the TEl technique of spec-ifying 'subtypes' of links: in those cases in whichit may be difficult to identify precisely the type ofrelation that exists between two entities, we intro-duced a more general relation to be used as type ofa link, as well as more specific relations to be usedas values of the SUBTYPE attribute in those cases inwhich this additional specification is possible.
Weused this technique for two types of relations: pos-session relations (which include generic attribution,true possession and part as subtypes) and event re-lations (which include relations such as cause and'role' as subparts).
The following example illustrateshow type and subtype attributes can be used to en-code possession relations at the desired level of pre-cision, as well as why sometimes it may be difficultto decide which relation holds between two discourseentities.

As a preliminary proposal, wesuggest hat annotators try first to identi~" an an-tecedent which is identical with the mmphor; if thatfails, they should try first to find a discourse ntitywith which the anaphor stands in one of the set re-lations, then one with which it stands in one of thegeneralized possession relations.8 S ta te  o f  the  Proposa l ;  Fur therWorkSo far, we have used to scheme to annotate a TRAINSdialogue, a MAPTASK dialogue, and a dialogue fromthe microfusees corpus collected by LOmA.
We arecurrently running a reliability study of the exten-sion dealing with references to the visual situation,while waiting for the preliminary release of the MATEworkbench to study the more complex features ofthe scheme.
This will also involve trying to extracta coding book from the manual by fixing up someparameters.
As the preliminary release of the MATEworkbench is planned for May, we may be able toreport some results already at the ACL meeting.AcknowledgmentsThe MATE project is supported by European Union,Telematics LE4-8370.
