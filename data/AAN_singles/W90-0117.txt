Pars imonious and Profl igate Approaches to theQuest ion of Discourse Structure Relat ionsEduard H.

If so, what interclausal relations are there?How many are required?
A fair amount of controversyexists, ranging from the parsimonious position (thattwo intentional relations uffice) to the profligate posi-tion (that an open-ended set of semantic/rhetorical re-lations is required).
This paper outlines the argumentsand then summarizes a survey of the conclusions ofapproximately 25 researchers - - from linguists to com-putational linguists to philosophers to Artificial Intelli-gence workers.
It classifies the more than 350 relationsthey have proposed into a hierarchy of increasingly se-mantic relations, and argues that though the hierarchyis open-ended in one dimension, it is bounded in theother and therefore does not give rise to anarchy.
Evi-dence for the hierarchy is mentioned, and its relations(which are rhetorical and semantic in nature) are shownto be complementary to the two intentional relationsproposed by the parsimonious position.How Many Interc lausa l  Dis-course Coherence  Re lat ions?This paper proposes an answer to an issue thatkeeps surfacing in the computational study of thenature of multisentential discourse.It has been argued fairly generally that mul-tisentence texts (specifically, short texts such*This work was supported by the Rome Air DevelopmentCenter under RADC contract FQ7619-89-03326-0001.as paragraphs) are coherent by virtue of therhetorical or semantic relationships that holdamong individual clauses or groups of clauses (see,for example, \[Aristotle 54, Hobbs 79, Grimes 75,Mann & Thompson 88\].
In this view, a text is onlycoherent when the speaker aids the heater's infer-ential understanding processes by providing clues,during the discourse, as to how the pieces of thetext interrelate.
Such clues are often cue words andphrases uch as "in order to" (signalling a purposefor an action) or "then" (signalling the next entityin some temporal or spatial sequence); but they canalso be shifts in tense and mode (such as in "Shewas gone.
Had she been there, all would have beenwell"), and even appropriate pronominalizations.Various researchers in various intellectual sub-fields have produced lists of such relations forEnglish.
Typically, their lists contain betweenseven and thirty relations, though the more de-tailed the work (which frequently means the closerthe work is to actual computer implementation),the more relations tend to be named.
I havecollected the lists of over 25 researchers - -  fromphilosophers (e.g., \[Toulmin 58\]) to linguists (e.g.,\[Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85\]) to compu-tational linguists (e.g., \[Mann & Thompson 88,Hobbs 79\]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers(e.g., \[Schank & Abelson 77, Moore & Paris 89,Dahlgren 88\]) - -  amounting to a total of more than350 relations.
The researchers and their lists ap-pear below.In this paper, I will call the assumption of theseresearchers, namely that some tens of interclausalrelations are required to describe the structure ofEnglish discourse, the Profligate Position.128Unfortunately, the matter of interclausal rela-tions is not simple, and not everyone agrees withthis position.
These relations are seldom explicitlysignalled in the text, and even when they are, theyseem to take various forms particular to their usein context.
This fact has led some researchers, no-tably \[Grosz & Sidner 86\], to question the wisdomof identifying a specific set of such relations.
Theyargue that trying to identify the "correct" set is adoomed enterprise, because there is no closed set;the closer you examine interclausal relationships,the more variability you encounter, until you findyourself on the slippery slope toward the full com-plexity of semantics proper.
Thus though they donot disagree with the idea of relationships betweenadjacent clauses and blocks of clauses to providemeaning and to enforce coherence, they object tothe notion that some small set of interclausal rela-tions can describe English discourse adequately.As a counterproposal, Grosz and Sidner sidestepthe issue of the structure of discourse im-posed by semantics and define two very ba-sic relations, DOMINANCE and SATISFACTION-PRECEDENCE, which carry purely intentional (thatis, goal-oriented, plan-based) import.
They usethese relations in their theory of the structure ofdiscourse, according to which some pieces of thetext are either subordinate to or on the same levelas other pieces, with respect to the interlocutors'intentions.
I will call this position, namely that twointerclausal relations uffice to represent discoursestructure, the Parsimonious Position.From the point of view of text analysis, theParsimonious approach seems satisfactory.
Cer-tainly one can analyze discourse using the two in-tentional relations.
However, from the point ofview of text generation, this approach is not suf-ficient.
Practical experience has shown that textplanners cannot get by on intentional considera-tions alone, but need considerably more rhetor-ical and semantic information in order to con-struct coherent text (there are many examples; see\[McKeown 85, Hovy 88a, Moore & Swartout 88,Paris 88, Rankin 89, Cawsey 89\]).
In practicalterms, this means that text planning systems re-quire a rich library of interclausal relations.Questions uch as?
Does one really need semantic and/or rhetori-cal discourse structure relations??
Just how many such relations are there??
What is their nature?
How do they relate tothe two intentional relations?will not go away.
Until it is resolved to the satisfac-tion of the adherents both positions, further workon text planning and discourse analysis is liable tocontinue getting stranded on the rocks of misunder-standing and disagreement.
This paper suggests acompromise that hopefully opens up the way forfurther development.An Unsatisfactory SolutionHow can one reconcile the two sides?
That is tosay, how can one build a library of interclausal re-lations that are simultaneously expressive noughto satisfy the requirements oftext planning systemsbut do not simply form an unbounded ad hoc col-lection of semantic relations with no regard to theintentional ones?One answer is to produce a two-dimensional or-ganization of relations, with one dimension con-strained in the number of relations and the otherunconstrained (and increasingly semantic in na-ture; see Objection 1 below).
Such organization isa hierarchic taxonomy of limited width but of un-bounded depth; the more general a relation is, thehigher it is in the hierarchy and the fewer siblingsit has.An appealing hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.
Itdisplays a number of very desirable features.
Inparticular, the top few levels are strictly bounded:no logical alternatives to ASYMMETRIC and SYM-METRIC exist, and one level lower, under ASYM-METRIC, following Grosz and Sidner there is noneed to use any other relation than DOMINATESand SATISFACTIONPRECEDES at that level.
In-creasingly detailed relations appear at lower lev-els, which (as is discussed below) remain relativelybounded.
Still, the more one specifies a particu-lar relation to distinguish it from others, the moresemantic it necessarily becomes (since increasingspecification invariably introduces additional se-mantic features; that is the nature of the specializa-tion process), and the lower it appears in the hierar-chy.
Though one does eventually approach the fullcomplexity of semantics proper, the approach is notunprincipled; each relation is always constrained byits position in the hierarchy and inherits much ofits structural and other features from its ancestors.In this scheme, one can (and the Parsimo-nious do) perform discourse analysis and study dis-course structure wholly at the level of DOMINATES129Figure 1: An Unsatisfactory Attempt at Hierarchicalizing Interclausal Relations.II IAsymmetric SymmetricI II I I IDominates SatisfactionPrecedes Comparative LoE ica lRe la t ionI I I I. .

- etc.and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES, and never come intoconflict with the structural descriptions found em-pirically by the Profligate.
One is simply not beingas specific about the particular interclausal rela-tions that make up the discourse.However, this taxonomy is unsatisfactory.
It isimpossible in practise to place into the hierarchywith certainty most of the relations found necessaryby the Profligate.
For example, the relation CAusE(of various kinds) is one of the most agreed-upon re-lations.
But is it to be classified as a type of DOM-INATES or of SATISFACTIONPRECEDES?
Though itseems able to function either way, this question isimpossible to answer, since none of the conceptsinvolved are clearly enough defined (certainly no-body has provided a general definition of CAUSE - -how could one?
; it has been the topic of centuriesof philosophical debate.
And even the limited def-inition required for the purposes of ComputationalLinguistics in a particular application domain witha given ontology of terms has not been providedsatisfactorily et).A Bet ter  Solut ionThe answer to the dilemma: It is a mistake to clas-sify rhetorical and semantic relations under the re-lations DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES.This insight does not destroy the hierarchy; mostof its desirable properties are maintained.
It doesmean, however, that a new top-level organizationmust be found and that the role of intentional re-lations vis ?
vis rhetorical/semantic relations mustbe explained.
I address the first point here, andthe role of the intentional relations later on.I have not found any highly compelling top-levelorganization.
Ideally, the top level should parti-tion the relations into a few (say, three or four)major groups that share some rhetorical or se-mantic property.
In the absence of a more com-pelling suggestion (for which I continue to search),I use here the top-level trifurcation of \[Halliday 85\],which is based, roughly speaking, on the "semanticdistance" between the contents of the two clauses.The three relations are ELABORATION, ENHANCE-MENT, and EXTENSION.
ELABORATION relationshold between entities and their immediate con-stituents or properties, and have a definitional fla-vor; ENHANCEMENT relations hold between enti-ties and their circumstances of place, time, manner,etc.
; and EXTENSION relations hold between enti-ties and more distant entities uch as causes, follow-ups, contrasts, etc.
Halliday's classification hasbeen modified and regularized by Matthiessen (per-sonM communication).
For want of compelling ar-guments to the contrary, I use Matthiessen's mod-ification of I-Ialliday's ideas as the basis for the toplevel of the hierarchy.In order to construct he hierarchy, I collectedover 350 relations from 26 researchers in variousfields.
I merged the relations, coming up with aset of 16 on the second tier of the hierarchy, andthen classified more particular subrelations whereappropriate.
The hierarchy of interclausal rela-tions is given in Figure 2.
The number associatedwith each relation indicates the number of differentresearchers who have listed the relation and mayserve as a vote of confidence in it.The following list contains each relation in thehierarchy together with its proposers (identified130Elaboration (101Figure 2: A Hierarchy of InterclausalRelations.iIdentification (10)~ObjectAt t r ibute  (9)ElabObject ObjectFunction (3)~SetMember  (3)E labPar t~ProcessStep  (5)~WholePar t  (8)\ElabGenerality~GeneralSpecific (14)AbstractInstance (13)Interpretation (2)--Evaluation (3)S-mmary (4)Restatement (9)/Conclusion (7)_Location (6).

94-113TNR: Sergei Nirenburg et al \[Tucker et al 86\]Some Evidence for the HierarchyStructureSome nonconclusive vidence supports  parts  of thehierarchy, though further s tudy must  be done toexamine all the relat ions.
This  evidence is based132on sensitivity to generalization evinced by manycue words and phrases.
For example, the cue word"then" is associated with SEQUENCE, and can beused appropriately to indicate its subordinates SE-QTEMPORAL and SEQSPATIAL, as in:SEQTEMPORAL: First you play the longnote, then the short onesSEQSPATIAL: On the wall I have a redpicture, then a blue oneIn contrast, the cue words for the two subrelationsare specific and cannot be interchanged without in-troducing the associated connotation:SEQTEMPORAL: After the 10ng note youplay the short onesSEQSPATIAL: Beside the red picture is theblue oneThus the relation associated with "then" subsumesthe relations associated with "after" and "beside".Similar observations hold for a number of the rela-tions (e.g., SOLUTIONHOOD and RESTATEMENT).Preliminary investigation indicates possible ad-ditional evidence in the syntactic realization ofsome relations: When a relation typically gives riseto a dependent clause, then its subrelations tend todo so as well.
More study must be done by a trainedlinguist.Role of Intent ional  Relat ionsWhat then of the two relations DOMINATES andSATISFACTIONPRECEDES?
They do not appearanywhere in the hierarchy in Figure 2.The answer is that these two relations expressinformation that is independent of the rhetori-cal/semantic meanings of the relations in the tax-onomy and only apply in discourses with inten-tional, plan-like nature.
They derive from earlywork on a highly plan-oriented domain \[Grosz 81\],in which plan steps' preconditions led to underly-ing precedence orderings of plan steps and satis-faction of subgoals which were dominated by su-pergoals.
However, not all discourse is plan-like;a large proportion of everyday close discourse be-tween people achieves goals for which, it can beargued, no plans can be formulated (for some suchgoals see \[Hovy 88b\]): the banter between friendswhich serves to strengthen i terpersonal bonds, thediscussions in supermarket lines, the language andpresentation styles employed in order to be friendlyor attractive, etc.
Such communications also ex-hibit internal structure, and also employ the rhetor-ical/semantic nterclausal relations.However, it is not clear how to generalize DOMI-NATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES to cover suchcases as well.
One possible generalization is to usethe general relations HYPOTAXIS and PARATAXIS(that is, asymmetrical and symmetrical relation-ships:HYPO: Joe left because Sue worked (5Sue worked because Joe left)PARA: He shouted when the horsejumped (= the horse jumped when heshouted)respectively).
But this does not work because bothDOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are bytheir natures asymmetrical.
Another possible gen-eralization is to use the two syntactic relationsMULTIVARIATE and UNIVARIATE (that is, contain-ing an embedded syntactic type recursion (a gram-matical rank shift) ornot ,  as in:MULTI: Sue's working caused \[Joe toleave\] (S embedded in S)UNI: Joe left because Sue worked (twocoequal Ss)respectively).
This does not work either becausesome DOMINATES relations hold between syntacti-cally independent complete sentences, so no syn-tactic embedding occurs.Does this mean that the two intentional relationsshould simply be added into the hierarchy?
No,because they can be realized in the discourse byvarious rhetorical/semantic relations; for example,SATISFACTIONPREcEDEs can be expressed by SE-QUENCE, as in:First boil the water, then add the rice, andthen stiror by CAUSE, as in:The sun heats the desert, which causes theair to rise, which causes a breezeThus, in the absence of other candidate gener-alizations, one can conclude that the relationsDOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are in-dependent of the rhetorical/semantic axonomiza-tion and provide an additional dimension of infor-mation, used for those discourses that exhibit anappropriately intentional plan-like nature.Some Object ions AnsweredA number of objections may be raised to the tax-onomization presented here.
I attempt o respondto some of the more serious ones:133Object ion  1.
Does it make sense at all to or-ganize into a single taxonomy such disparate n-tities?
After all, RESTATEMENT and CONCESSIONare primarily rhetorical while, say, PURPOSE andPROCESSSTEP are  primarily semantic.Why not?
As a result of this study and previ-ous work, I believe that "rhetorical" relations aresimply the crudest or most generalized "semantic"ones; in other words, that no purely rhetorical orpurely semantic relations exist.
Some relations,typically those higher in the hierarchy, certainlyfulfill a more rhetorical function (i.e., provide moreinformation about the argumentational structure ofthe discourse) than a semantic function.
But noteven the topmost relations are entirely devoid of se-mantic meaning.
Since all the relations have somesemantic import (regardless of their structural im-port), this objection to their being arranged into asingle taxonomy for the purposes of discourse struc-ture description is groundless 1.Ob jec t ion  2.
What guarantee xists that therelations given in the taxonomy are indeed the"right" ones?
Or the only ones?
It is not diffi-cult to come up with relations that differ in someway from those in the taxonomy and that do notneatly fall under a single item in it.This is a standard objection to any set of termsproposed to fulfill some function.
The standard re-sponse holds here too: there is no guarantee thatthese are the "right" relations, whatever "right"may mean.
Similarly, there is no guarantee thatthe terms \[VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE ADVERB .
.
.
\]are the "right" and "only" terms for types of words;they have simply been canonized by long use andmuch experience.
There is enough evidence fromactual attempts at constructing working systems(text planners and discourse analyzers) that rela-tions at this level of interclausal representation arerequired to guide inference and planning processes.Without such relations we simply cannot constructan adequate account of the structure of a discourse1This position is in contradistinction with that of Sys-temic Linguistics, which holds that semantic relations are ofthe type Ideational while rhetorical relations are of the typeTextual.
Since both kinds of relations erve the same func-tion, namely to bind together different pieces of knowledge,and certain relations operate both interclausally and intra-clausally, there  seems to me no reason to differentiate heminto two dif ferent types.
I categorize discourse structure re-lations with  those  called Ideational, and group separatelyall those phenomena that reflect the characteristics of thecommunicative s tting: referentially available artifacts andconcepts, the nature of the medium (telephone, paper, con-versation, etc.
), and the physical and social context (back-ground noise, available time, etc.
).nor plan an adequate multisentence paragraph bycomputer.The particular relations proposed here are cer-tainly open to question, and their strongest supportis that they are the amalgamation and synthesis ofthe efforts and proposed terms of over 25 differentinvestigators from different fields, as noted previ-ously.
In addition, there is always the possibilitythat new interclausal relations will be needed thatcannot in fact be subsumed under existing nodesin the taxonomy.
While not impossible, I believethis is unlikely, based on my experience in compil-ing the hierarchy: After the top three levels hadmore or less been established halfway through thisstudy, only one new second-level relation - -  IDEN-TIFICATION - -  had to be added.
I expect hat whennew domains are investigated, the hierarchy willgrow primarily at the bottom, and that the ratioof the number of relations added at one level to thenumber of relations added at the next lower level,averaged across all levels, will be well below 0.2.Ob jec t ion  3.
The taxonomy is unbounded to-ward the bottom: it places one on the slipperyslope toward having to deal with the full complex-ity of semantic meaning.
Simply working on thestructure of discourse is difficult enough withoutbringing in the complexity of semantic knowledge.This is the the Parsimonious Position objection.There is no reason to fear the complexity of anunbounded set of terms, whether semantic or not,as long as the terms are well-behaved and sub-ject to a pattern of organization which makes themmanageable.
A hierarchicalization of the terms inwhich all the pertinent information about discour-sal behavior is captured at the top (which is maxi-mally general, bounded, and well-understood) andnot at the bottom (which permits unboundednessand redundancy) presents no threat to computa-tional processing.
Each discourse relation simplyinherits from its ancestors all necessary process-ing information, such as cue words and realizationconstraints, adding its unique peculiarities, to beused for inferring its discoursal role (in parsing) orfor planning out a discourse (in generation).
In-creasing differentiation of relations, continued un-til the very finest nuances of meaning are sepa-rately represented, need be pursued only to theextent required for any given application.
Thus"unbounded" growth of semantic relations is not aproblem, as long as they can be subsumed underexisting nodes in the taxonomy.Ob jec t ion  4.
The hierarchy contains no explic-itly structural relations, yet explicit signals of dis-134course structure are very common.
Why are theynot included?In fact, the relations people use to signal dis-course structure (such as parallelism, say) are in-cluded in the taxonomy.
The most popular elation(one that appeared as a separate relation in a num-ber of the studies cited) is PARALLEL, which is in-variably signalled using some set of SEQUENCE rela-tions, often after having been explicitly introducedby a separate clause.
The fact that SEQUENCErelations can be used to signal both semantic se-quentiality and rhetorical structure is no reason foralarm; if conditions hould arise in which the twofunctions require different behavior, a more specificrelation subordinated to SEQUENCE, dedicated toexpressing purely rhetorical sequentiality (such as,say, SEQSTRUCTURAL), can be created, though itis likely that in the actual presentation, the rhetor-ical sequence will usually follow some temporal orspatial sequence in any case.ConclusionA rather gratifying result of the synthesis presentedhere is that only 16 core relations, organized into3 principal types, suffice to cover essentially all theinterclausal relations proposed by the sources.
Thissuggests that other relations not yet in the hierar-chy are likely to be subtypes of relations alreadyin it, preserving the boundedness of the number ofrelation types.
The relations are rhetorical in na-ture, becoming increasingly semantic as they be-come more specific; the claim is that the rhetoricalrelations are simply least delicate (i.e., most gen-eral) semantic relations.While some evidence is provided for the struc-ture of the hierarchy, as well as for the claim thatthe relations are independent of the goal-orientedplan-based iscourse structure relations proposedby \[Grosz & Sidner 86\], there is no claim that thishierarchy is complete or correct in all details.
Itis certainly open to elaboration, enhancement, andextension!
The hope is that it will serve the com-munity by proving to be a common starting pointand straw man for future work on discourse struc-ture.AcknowledgmentsThanks to Christian Matthiessen, John Bateman,Robin Cohen, Kathleen McCoy, Kathleen McKe-own, Johanna Moore, Mick O'Donnell, and C4cileParis, and to everyone who sent me their relations.I am still collecting relations and will continue toupdate this hierarchy.References\[Aristotle 54\] Aristotle.
