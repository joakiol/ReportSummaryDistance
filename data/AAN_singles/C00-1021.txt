'.139(b) Na Shetlandsk~jch ostvovech se mluv(ANGLICKY.The conmmnicative function of the sentencecan basically be rendered by understanding itstopic (T) as 'what is the sentence about', andits focus (F) as the information that is assertedabout the topic, i.e., schematically, the interpre-tation of the sentence S can be understood ass - F(T)Thus, (1)(a) asserts, on its preferred reading(with just the locative modification constitutingits focus) about where English is spoken thatit is in the Shetlandt, which hardly can be ac-cepted as true w.r.t, what we know of the actualworld, if no specific context is present.
(1)(b) isunderstood as true, stating about E. that it isspoken in the S.In the TGTSs the order of nodes is such thatall parts of T precede all parts of F. Moreover,the order of nodes corresponds to the scale ofcommunicative dynamism (CD, see Section 3below); a less dynamic node prototypically hasthe broader scope than a more dynamic one (ifthe nodes correspond to operators).
F proper isthen the most dynamic (the rightmost) node.TFA is relevant also tbr the semantics of nega-tion:(2) John(a)(b)didn't come because he was ILL.The reason for Jolm's not-coming washis illness.The reason for John's coming (e.g.
tothe doctor) was not his illness butsomething else (e.g.
he wanted to in-vite the doctor for a party).With the paraphrase (a), the negated verb'come' is included in T, i.e.
the fact that John'sbeing ill is the cause of an event is asserted aboutthe event that he did not come.
With (b), themain verb 'come' alto belongs to T, but what itnegated, is the relation between T and F: Johncame, but what is asserted about his coming isthat the cause of this event was not his illness(he might have been ill, though).Every node in a TGTS is either contextuallybound (CB) or non-bound (NB); this opposi-tion is a linguistic couterpart of the cognitivedichotomy of 'given' vs. hmw', where also anitem, if corresponding to a 'given' referent pre-sented as occupying a newly characterized spe-cific position (often in relation to one or more'given' items), has the feature NB, cf.
:(3) Give th, is to YOUR mother.
(My parentsdon't like s~tch gifts.
)kno',,,s  oth ete," ,lane.)
Ho,.ever, th.is time she only invited IIER.The indexical pronoun 'your' in (3) and theanaphoric pronoun 'her' in (4) can only rethr toitems that in a sense are 'known' in the givensituation.
However, in these examples, both ofthem occur as NB; their stress indicates theirflmction as F proper of the respective sentence.Prototypically, an NB node belongs to F and aCB node is in T; however, a node not dependentimmediately on a finite verb (esp.
an adjunct)need not meet this condition.
Thus, in (5), 'my'as a shifter, directly determined by the condi-tions of the discourse, is CB, although belong-ing to F, since it; depends on a part of F (see(HajiSovi~ et al, 1998) fbr a definition of T andF on the basis of contextual boundness and ofsyntactic dependency, aswell as for other detailsof the given descriptive frmnework).2.2 The  a t t r ibute  TFA in PDTThree values of the attribute TFA are distin-guished with every node in a TGTS:1.
T a non-contrastive CB node, which alwayshas a lower degree of CD than its governor,if any;2.
F an NB node (if different from the mainverb, then following after its head word inthe TGTS)3.

t br every pair of nodes x, y in a TGTS itholds that if x depends on y and x follows (pre-cedes) 37, then every node z following (preceding)y and preceding (following) x is subordinate toy.
Thus, 'not to meet the condition of projec-tivity' concerns tim 'analytic' trees; this means,in other words, that this condition would not bemet if the positions of x and y in the left-to-rightorder of the nodes in the TOTS (in the 'under-lying word order') always corresponded to theirpositions in the surface (morphemic and %na-lytic') word order.Example (with a very simplified linearized no-tation of the TGTS, in which every dependentis closed in its pair of parentheses):(7) K jdsotu(C) neni(F) nejmen.~:f(F)For triumphing is-not the-least&~vod(F).reasoll(r') (neg.F) bTjt.F ((jdsot.C) d,fi, vod.F(neg.F) be.F ((triumlflfing.C) reason.F(least.F))A sentence with a non-prototypic~fi placementof the IC:(8) (Vdtgina m, inistr'gt St@aginovy novd vlddypatti k v&'n~m dr,uh,~irn cjzndmgj,~'\[h,oruskdho intrikdna Berezovskdh, o.

supposed to have been deleted inthe surface form of the sentence), and thus alsoits position in the underlying word order, is de-termined on the basis of its relationship to itsgoverning node.
Since such a node ahnost al-ways is contextually bound (with the exceptionof the specific case of coordinated structures, seethe Note after point 8 in Section 2.2 above), itis placed to the left of its governing word; morespecifically:(a) if the restored node RN depends on a verb,then:(b)(c)(aa) if RN is not the single item dependingon the given verb token, then RN isto be added in the 'Wackernagel posi-tion';(ab) if RN has no sister nodes, then it isplaced at the beginning of the clause;if RN is restored as depending on a noun(or adjective), I{N is placed as the least dy-namic dependent of this governing word;if more than one node are inserted as de-pending on one and the same item, thentheir order should confornl to tile systemic(%anonical') ordering of the valency slots(see the remark on SO in Section 2.2 above,point 4).Point (a) appears to be substantiated by thefact that e.g.
the subject )ronolln appears ill thezero form in Czech under similar conditions asthe weak, clitic pronouns, for which the positionimlnediately to the left of the verb is typical, cf.sentences such as VSera (on) p~'igel pozd5 \]Yes-terday (he) canto here late\], Janu (oni) nevidSli\[lit.
: .Jane-Accus they have-not-seen\], o1"(On)spal \[He was-sleeping\].
This concerns also suchdeletable items as e.g.
the Directional with pfi-jet \[arrive\], cf.
Jan dnes (sere/tam) ncp~'~;jcl \[ it..John to-day (he,'e/there) has-not-arrived\].The appropriateness of these preliminaryrules is being checked uring the tagging proce-dure, the results of which will be of importancefor a more exact (and more complete) formula-tion of the relevant parts of the description ofthe sentence structure of Czech.
This aspect142of the useflflness of the corpus tagging concernsalso many ol;h(;r 1)oinl;s of grammar.2.4 Under ly ing  and  sur face word  orderWithin the tagging procedure, tim differencesbetween the two levels of the left-to-right ordercan be described 1)y movelnent rules, a prelimi-nary tbrm of which can be brietly characterizedas follows:1. if a node 1111 carries C and a node M2 de-l)ending on M1 is 1)laced to the right of anode M3 superordinate o M1 in the surtkceword order, then M1 is placed immediatelyto the left of M2 in the resulting tree; cf.e.g.
&o,'tov~',c (M1) o,, .# (M3) dob,",'j (M2)Ilit.

in sentences exhibiting a secondary place-ment of IC, the bearer of IC occupies therightmost 1)osition in the resulting l:ree; cf.example (\])(b) in Section 2.1 al)ove, inwhi('h 'English' is tile t bt:us prol)er; the as-suinl)gion underlying the.
t)lacemenl; of ICin a written text is that g~ written form of ~sentence may correspond to dit\[erent (silo-ken) sentences, according to the differencesof the 1)lacement of IC in the al)l)ropriateway of 1)renouncing t;he sentence.3 The  spec ia l  case of  focus  sens i t i vepar t ic lesSince the focus sensitive particles are idengified(1)y the flmctor value RHEM for 'rhematizer' or'focalizer'), it is possitfle to use PDT also fora sl)ecitication of their occurrences in differentpositions 1)oth in the det)endency structure ofthe sentence and in its TFA.

'1433.2 Focus sensitive particles in thehierarchy of comnmnicat ivedynamismThe primary position of a focalizer ill a TR is atthe boundary between tile topic and the focusof the verb clause and the tbcus of tile clause isthen identical to tile focus of tile focalizer.
If afbcalizer is included in the topic, then its focuscontains those items which in the TR are placedbetween this focalizer mid the next item ularkedas C to tile right and are nlore dynamic than thetbcalizer).It should be noted that CD is understood hereas a partial ordering defined so that:(i) in every set of a head and its daughternodes, every daughter node placed to theright of its head is more dynamic than ev-cry daughter node placed to the left of itshead;(ii) the relation 'more dynanfic' is deternlinedby the irrettexive trausil;ive closure of (i).~i'hus, e.g.
in the TI{ (10'), 'knows' is more dy-nalnic than 'Paul' and less dynmnic than 'saw'according to tile point (i), and both 'only' and'Mary', being more dynanlic titan 'saw', aremore dynmnie than ~knows' according to thepoint (ii); however, ~Thomas' is neither morenor less dynamic than 'knows'.
If (10) is cut-bedded into a more conlplex sentence as (a partof) its topic, titan 'Mary' is more dynanfic thml%nly' and has the f~atm'e C; thus, e.g.
with'Since Paul knows that Thomas saw only Mary,he is not afraid', 'Mary' constitutes the whole flof 'only', similarly as in (10').Tile underlying word order W (a linear order-ing) is then defined on the basis of CD, with (iii)and (iv) holding tbr every two nodes x and y ina tree:(iii) if node x is nlore dynamic than node y, thenx tbllows y under W;(iv) if node x follows node y under W, node u issubordinated to x and node z is subordinateto y, then u tbllows both y and z, and xfollows z under W.Among tile non-prototyt)ical , secondary posi-tions of tbcalizers, there are also the cases oftheir clustering (e.g.
'not only'), as well as thesentences in which a focalizer itself constitutesthe whole locus of tile sentence ('He DID realizethis').4 SummaryAfter a brief characterization f the Prague De-pendency Treebank and of tile Praguian theoryof Topic-Focus Articulation we have presenteda proposal how the main aspects of tile intbr-nlation structure of the sentence (i.e.
of itstopic-focus articulation) cml be integrated intothe tagging system that captures the underly-ing structures.
The present form of the systemnmkes it possible to check our hypotheses on alarge text corpus, and thus perhaps to achievea higher degree of automation (and reliability)of the proposed procedure.
The last section ex-emplifies how the t)roposed approach makes itpossible to analyze structures with the so-calledfocus sensitive operators.References.Jan Ha.ji(?.
