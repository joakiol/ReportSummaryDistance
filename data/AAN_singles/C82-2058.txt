OPERATION LOGIC - A DATABASE MANAGEMENT OPERATION SYST~OF HUMAN-LIKE INFORMATION PROCESSINGV~clav Pol~k and Nad~da Pol~kov~ ( in  memoriam)Z~vod v~po~etD/ techn iky  ~SAD, Brno, Czechos lovak iaThe paper conta ins  the  descr ip t ion  of  a database mana-gement computer operation system called operat ion logic.
Thissystem is a formal logic with wel l -def lned formulas as se-mantic language clauses and with reasoning by means of modusponens rules.
There are four frames - CLAUSE, QUESTION,I:~O~T.~, SYST~.
Each of  these  frames i s  processed by oneprogram.
By means of  these  programs i t  can be rea l i zed  under -s tand ing  of  any c lause ,  answer ing any reasonab le  quest ion ,so lv ing  az~7 reasonab le  problem and unders tand ing  any organ izat -l one l  s t ruc ture .
Some a lgor i thms of operat ion  log ic  are  de-sc r ibed  and examples of  c lauses  are exh ib i ted .
Our approachi s  the fo l low ing :(1) In fo rmat ion  process in~ of  sub teots~ Mater ia l  ob jec tsare  anorganic  ob jec ts  or  o rgan ic  ones.
They are a l so  non- l i veob jec ts  or l i ve  ones.
L ive ob jec ts  reproduce themse lves  auto -nomously.
L ive ob jec ts  are o rgan ic  ind iv idua ls  or  a r t i f i c ia lones.
Organic ind iv idua ls  are  one-ce l lu la r  or  mu l t i - ce l lu la r .They are a lso  heterot roph ic  ( they  consume organ ic  ob jec ts )  orautot roph ic  ( they  consume anorgan ic  ob jec ts  on ly ) .
Mu l t i - ce l l -u la r  autot roph ic  organ ic  ind iv idua ls  are ca l led  p l~ts .
Mu l t i -ce l lu la r  heterot roph io  o rgan ic  ind iv idua ls  are  ca l led  sub teots .P lants  have no moving organs and no consc iousness .
They donot need them.
Sub jec ts  have moving organs and consc iousness .They need them for  search ing ,  hunt ing  and escape.
Each sub-Jec ts  has genera l  knowledge database .
I t  conta ins  in fo rmat ion- 234 -about types of  scenes (ca l led  image-frames)  in the form thescenes are seen by the sub jec t  by i t s  eyes,  but in  a verys imp l i f i ed  form.
I t  conta ins  a l so  sequences of  scenes (ca l ledscener ies  ) represent ing  ru les  (ca l led  mgdus ponens ru les )accord ing  to  which changes in  the  un iverse  are rea l i zed .
Eachsub jec t  has concrete  knowledge database represent ing  h i s to ryof  l i fe  of  the sub jec t  and image-frame of  ac tua l  scene~ Eachsub jec t  const ruc ts  poss ib le  scenes and rea l i zes  program, edbehav iour  of  i t se l f .
Each sub, sot  has in fo rmat ion  process ingdatabase mans~ament operat ion  system having both above data -bases in  long term memory ~nd process ing  ac tua l  knowledge inshor t  term memory.
A sub jec t  i s  ca l led  human, i f  i t  i s  ab le  todescr ibe  scenes by means of  p rocesses  ( i .e .
to  decode image-- f rames in to  fo rmulu  (ca l led  c lauses)  represent ing  processes)and i f  i t  const ruc ts  ~ew c lauses  from the o ld ones by meansof  modus ponens ru les  (ca l led  reasonS) .
Sub jec ts  wi th consc i -ousness wi thout  above proper t ies  are ca l led  an imals .
Humansoperat ion  system for  in fo rmat ion  process ing  i s  ca l led  o e_~.e~-ion  log ic ,  humans c lauses  form & system ca l led  semanticlanguage.
Humans have the ab i l i ty  to  exchange in fo rmat ionamong themselves  by means of  c lauses  (such ac t iv i ty  i s  ca l ledd i~o~) .
We have thus the fo l low ing  s tages  o f  in fo rmat ionprocess ing :  F i r s t  there  are anorganic  ob jec ts  on ly .
Then organ-i c  ob jec ts  appear by a random.
Then by means of natura l  se lec t -ion one-cellular heterotrophie organic individuals (bacteria)appear.
From bacteria one-cellular autotrophic organic individ-uals are developed (cyanoph?cae).
Prom bacteria more sophlsti-c~ted one-cellular heterotrophic protozoa are developed andby symbiosis from protozoa and cyanop~vcae one-cellular auto-trophic al~ae appear.
From algae plants are developed and fromprotozoa animals.
From animals humans are developed (namelybecause of necessity of exchange information in social product-ion activities).
(2) Semantic la~a~a~e clause.
In each scene there areindividuals (like TREE, JOHN, FEAR) and processes (like TO-GO,- 235 -TO-EXPLAIN).
Names of individuals are called atomic individu-al__.ss (or nouns), names of processes are called verb__._~s.
In eachprocess participating individuals play Certain roles (calledindividual members) like (TO-GO WHO WITH-WHOM), (TO-EXPLAINWHO WHAT TO-WHOM).
Individuals have properties (like BLUE,EMPTY).
Processes have properties (like QUICKLY, DAILY).
Pro-pertiee of individuals are called attributes, properties ofprocesses are called adverbs.
Names of attributes are calledatomic attributes (or adjectives), names of adverbs are call-ed atomic adverbs.
There are several types of adverbs (calledBdverb ia l  .members), each of  them descr ibes  the c i rcumstancesthe  process  i s  rea l i zed .
The process  i s  rea l i zed  in  euc l ideanthree  d imensibnal  space (NHERE-PLACE,WHERE-NEAR, WHERE-FAR,~IERE-INSIDE, %~-/~E-OUTSIDE, ~CdF.~%E-BESIDE, WHERE-LEPT, WHERE--HIGHT, V~RE-BEPORE, WHERE-BEHIND, WHERE-BELOW, WHERE-ABOVE,~-AROUND,  VP~ERE-A~ONG, ~/tEaRET~F~N, FROM, TO, VIA,DISTANCE) in linear time scale (WHEN-ANTERIORITY, WHEN-SIMUL-TANEITY, r~N-POSTERIORITY, BEGI~ING, END, FREQUENCY, DURAT-ION) under validity of several modus ponens rules (CAUSE,RESULT, PURPOSE, CONCESSION) with instruments (BY-MEANS-OF)and acoordinE to algorithm types (BY-~AT-WAY, INTENSITY,RESEMBLING).
Hence we have (ATOMIC-INDIVIDUAL (ATTRIBUTE(K))K) for individuals (such form is called compound individ-ual) and (VERB ( INDIVIDUAL-~3ER(I)) I  (ADVERBIAL-MEM~ER(J))J)for processes i.e.
for clauses.
Modus ponens rules are of theform (IF CLAUSES THEN CLAUSES).
Individual can be atomic indi-vidual, compound individual, process-as-individual clause,meta-level clause.
Adverb can be atomic adverb, individual,adverb-defining clause.
Attribute can be atomic attribute,individual, attribute-defining clause.
To each clause someinformation about the whole clause belongs (called clauseparameters).
Individual members and adverbial members arecalled clause members .
Hence we have (VERB CLAUSE-MEMBERSCLAUSE-PARAMETERS) ?- 236 -(3)  C lause Dar~neters .
(a)  Conte~tuat i t  ~.
Because of  ex is tence  of shor t  te rmmemory one must d i s t ingu ish  in  each c lause  the  o ld  knowledge(ca l led  top ic )  and the  new one (ca l led  focus)  rece iv ing  thuseither (TOPIC-VERB TOPIC-CLAUSE-HEMBERS FOCUS-CLAUSE-M~BERS)or  (POCUS-VERB TOPIC-CLAUSE-MEmBERS POOUS-CLAUSE-~Y~S) .
(b)  Tense- Because ind iv idua ls ,  adverbs  and a t t r ibutescan be c lauses ,  we have fo r  each c lause  a graph  t ree  w i thclauses as vertices and to-be-superior-clause-of as edges.One needs only relative binary time relations (anteriority,simultaneity, posteriority).
We consider time of constructionof the clause and time of clause process realization.
Time ofconstruction of meta-level clause is the time of process real-ization of the superior clause.
Time of construction of clauseof o ther  types  i s  the  t ime of  const ruct ion  of  i t s  super io rc lause  (o r  in  the  case  of  top  c lause  - the  t ime of  send ing  i tby sender ) .

(4) Understandin~ .
Clauses are grouped into role-pairs(WHY-ROLE-CLAUSE HOW-ROLE-CLAUSES), modus ponens rules, scenesand denote-clauses.
Content of clauses is given by means ofsuch grouping.
It enables to operate with vague notions andeven with contradictions.
Each system, say S, is described byinput and output of structures, energy and records, by struct-ures as means and records as database, by scenes and by role--pairs, where wh~-roles are the roles being fulfilled by S andhow-roles are why-roles of subsystems of S. Understanding ofvery large systems and semantic mathematical analysis ofanthropoecoeystems is realized by the binary relation to-be--subsystem-of defined by role-pairs on SYSTEM's.
Example:(ROLE-PAIR(24): (WHY-ROLE: (TO-RECEIVE (WHO: IT) (WHAT:GLUCOSE))) (HOW-ROLE(1): (TO-REALIZE (WHO: IT) (WHAT: PHOTO-sn~sls)  ) ))- 239 -
