BackgroundA speech synthesizer is a machine that inputs a stream of textand outputs a speech signal.
This paper will discuss a smallpiece of how words are converted to phonemes.Text1Intonation Phrases1WORDS!PHONEMES!Lpe Dyads + Prosodics!SpeechTypically words are converted to phonemes in one of two ways:either by looking the words up in a dictionary (with possiblysome limited morphological nalysis), or by sounding the wordsout from their spelling using basic principles.?
Dictionary Lookup?
Letter to SoundBoth appt~oaches have their advantages and disadvantages;dictionary lookup fails for unknown words (e.g., proper nouns)and letter to sound rules fail for irregular words, which are alltoo common in English.
Most speech synthesizers adopt ahybrid strategy, using the dictionary when possible and turningto letter to sound rules for the rest.
I discussed letter to soundrules at the last meeting of the ACL \[Church\]; this paper willreport on some new dictionary lookup approaches, with anemphasis on morphology.Morphological decomposition is used to reduce the size of thedictionary and to increase coverage.
Instead of storing allpossible words, the system can store just a lexicon of morphemesand save a factor of 10 \[Jon Allen (personal communication)\] instorage.
Now when the system is given a word and asked todetermine is pronunciation, the system decomposes the word intoknown morphemes, looks up the pronunciation of each of thepieces and combines the results.2.
MITalk DecompThe best known morphological decomposition system is theDecomp module in the MITalk sysnthesizer \[Allen et.
al.\].
Thissystem attempted to parse an input word such as formally intomorphemes: form, -al and -ly.
It was assumed that morphemesare concatenated together (like "beads on a string") accordingto the finite state grammar shown below:The types of morphemes were:1.2.3.Prefixes (pref): UNtie, PERmit, REduceSuffixesa.
Derivational (derv): laxiTY, existENCE, softNESS,kingDOMb.
Inflectional (infl): boatiNG, toastED, coatS, roanS"Rootsa.
Free (root): stay, squeeze, largeb.
Absolute (absl): the, than, butc.
Left-Bound (lbrt): rePEL, conCEIVEd.
Right-Bound (rbrt): CRIMINal, TOLERancee.
Strong (root): women, rangCosts were placed on the arcs to alleviate overgeneration.
Notethat the grammar produces quite a number of spurious analyses.For example, not only would formally be analyzed as form-al-lybut it would also be analyzed as form-ally and for-mal-ly.
Thecost mechanism blocks these spurious analyses by assigningcompounding a higher cost than suffixation and thereforefavoring the desired analysis.
Although the cost mechanismhandles a large number of cases, it would be better to aimtoward a tighter grammar of morphology which did notovergenerate sobadly.156State Arc Costword-final: cat infl word-final 64cat derv right-sida-a 35cat root left-side-a 101cat lbrt middle 1091cat absl word-initial 1221right-side-a: cat derv right-side-a 35cat infl word-final 35cat rbrt left-side-a 66cat root left-side-a 101cat lbrt middle 1091right-side-b: cat derv right-side-a 963cat lbrt middle 2019cat infl word-final 992cat root left-side-a 1029cat rbrt left-side-a 66middle:left-side-a:word-initial:left-side-b:cat pref left-side-a 34cat root left-side-a 133cat derv right-side-b 67cat hyph word-final 1024cat infl word-final 1056cat lbrt middle 1155cat pref left-side-b 34cat hyph word-final 1024cat pref left-side-b 34cat derv right-side-a 1027cat lbrt middle 2083cat root left-side-a 1093cat hyph word-final 1024cat infl word-final 1056The MITalk Decomp program performed its task quite well; itcould analyze 95% of running text \[Allen (personalcommunication) \].
In order to achieve this level of performance,the authors of Decomp made a conscious decision not to dealwith stress alternations (festive I festivity),  vowel shift andtensing (divine / divinity), and other phonological rulesassociated with latinate morphology.
Basically, there was onlyone rule for combining the pronunciations of morphologicalpieces: simple concatenation with a few simple rules to accountfor spelling alternations at the juncture:?
Silent e deletes before a vocalic suffix: observe + ance "-'*observance?
Consonant doubles before a vocalic suttix: red + est - "reddest?
y -"  i before a suffix: glory + ous ~ glorious?
y deletes before a suffix starting with i: harmony + izeharmonizeAll affixes were assumed to be stress neutral.
Words likefest iv ity and divinity which require a richer understanding of theinteraction of morphology and phonology were entered into thelexicon as exceptions.The decision not to handle more complicated morphological ndphonological rules was based on the belief that it is hard to doan adequate job and that it wasn't necessary to do so becausethe rules are not very productive and hence it is possible (andpractical) to list all of the derived forms in the lexicon.
I'd liketo believe that morphology and phonology have progressedenough over the past ten years that this argument does not haveas much force as it did.
Nevertheless, I have to admit that thepayoff may be marginal, especially if measured in short termsavings in the size of the lexicon and memory costs.
The realvalue in the enterprise is more long term; I am betting thatpushing the theoretical linguistic understanding with ademanding application such as speech synthesis will uncoversome new insights.3.
Types of Morphological CombinationIt has long been recognized that "stress-shifting" morphology(e.g., divin+ity) differs in quite a number of respects from"stress neutral" morphology (e.g., divine#ness).
It is a well-established convention to mark the "stress-shifting" morphemeboundary with a "+"  symbol and to mark the "stress-neutral"boundary with a "#"  symbol.
(Scare quotes are placed around"stress-shifting" and "stress-neutral" because these terms areprobably not quite right.)
This paper will also use the termsLevel 1 and Level 2 to refer to the two types of morphologicalcombination, respectively.
This terminology is taken from theliterature on Level Ordered Morphology and Phonology (e.g.,\[Mohanan\]) which argues that "+"  boundary (level 1)morphology is ordered before "#"  boundary (level 2)morphology and that this ordering dependency has importanttheoretical implications.It is worthwhile to review some of the well-known differencesbetween "+"  boundaries and "#"  boundaries.
Informally "+"morphemes such as in +, ad +, ab +, +al, +ity are (generally)derived from Latin whereas "#"  morphemes such as #ness, #1ycome from Greek and German.
This historical trend is only arough correlation and has numerious counter-examples (e.g., theGerman suffix -ist behaves like "'+").
The program uses thefollowing set of prefixes and suffixes:?
Level 1 "+"  Prefixes: a, ab, ac, ad, af, ag, al, am, an, ap,at, as, at, bi, col, corn, con, cor, de, dif, dis, e, ec, ef, eg, el,em, en, er, es, ex, ira, in, ir, is, ob, oc, of, per, pre, pro, re,suf, sup, sur, sus, trans?
Level 1 "+"  Suffixes: ability, able, aceous, acious, acity,acy, age, al, ality, ament, an, ance, ancy, ant, ar, arity, ary,ate, ation, ational, ative, ator, atorial, atory, ature, bile,bility, ble, bly, e, ea, ean, ear, edge, ee, ence, ency, ent,ential, eous, ia, iac, ial, ian, iance, iant, iary, iate, iative,ibility, ible, ic, ical, ican, icate, ication, icative, icatory,ician, icity, icize, ide, ident, ience, iency, ient, ificate,ification, ificative, i f  y, ion, ional, ionary, ious, isation, ish,ist, istic, itarian, ite, ity, ium, ival, ive, ivity, ization, ize, le,ment, mental, mentary, on, or, ory, osity, ous, ular, ularity,ure, ute, utive, y?
Level 2 "#"  Prefixes: anti, co, de, for, mal, non, pre, sub,supra, tri, ultra, un157?
Level 2 "#"  Suffixes: able, bee, berry, blast, bodies, body,copy, culture, fish, ful, fulling, head, herd, hood, ism, ist,ire, land, less, line, ly, man, ment, mental, mentarian, most,ness, phile, phyte, ship, shire, some, tree, type, ward, way,wiseThere is also a well-known precedence relation between + and#.
With very few exceptions, # morphemes nest outside of +morphemes.
Thus, we have non # \[in + moral\] but not *in +\[non # moral\].
The precedence r lation yields some subtle (butJcorrect) predictions.
Observe that -able can be a level 1 affix insome cases (e.g., cbmparable) and a level 2 affix in others (e.g.,emplbyable).
Notice the contrast between INcomparable and.UNexmployable; the + marked comparable takes the + markedprefix in + whereas, in contrast, the # marked employable takesthe # marked prefix un#.
This same contrast is brought out bythe famous pair: indivisible I undividable.
(This argument is nolonger considered to be as convincining as it once was because ofso-called bracketting paradoxes which will be discussed shortly.
)Word formation rules are also sensitive to the difference between+ and #.
Note that + morphemes can attach to boundmorphemes (e.g., crimin + al), but # morphemes cannot (e.g.,*crimin #ness, *crimin # ly, *crimin # hood).
In addition, #morphemes attach more productively than + morphemes.
"It is clear that #ness attaches more productively to bases ofthe form Xous than does +ity: fabulousness is much"better" than fabulosity, and similarly for other pairs(dubiousness I dubiety, dubiosity).
There are even caseswhere the +ity derivative is not merely worse, butimpossible acrimonious I *acrinoniosity, euphonious I*euphonosity, famous I *famosity.
There is also the simplelist test, which is still a good indicator.
Walker (1936) listsfewer +ity derivatives than #ness derivatives of words of theform Xous."
\[Aronoff, pp.
37-38\].Aronoff continues to point out that the semantics of #boundaries tend to be more predictable and compositional than+ boundaries.
The meaning of callousness, for example, ismore predictable from the meanings of callous and ness thanthe meanings of variety, notoriety and curiosity are from themeanings of their parts.The following list summarizes some of the differences between +and #:?
+ morphemes are (often) historically correlated with Latin;# with German and Greek?
+ morphemes feed certain phonological rules (stressassignment, vowel shift); # do not.?
+ morphemes take precedence over #?
+ morphemes can attach to bound morphemes; # cannot?
+ morphemes are less productive than #?
+ morphemes have less predictable semantics than #The remainder of the paper will be divided into two sections, thefirst will be concerned with level 1 morphology and the secondwith level 2 morphology and compounding.
Level 1 morphologyhas been studied more heavily in the lingusitics literature; level2 is perhaps more important for practical applications, at leastin the short term.4.
Morphological Decomposition of Level I AffixesA number of the differences between + and # ought to berelevant in decomposing level 1 affixes and reducing theposibility of spurious derivations.
Consider how the firstdifference mentioned above, historical correlation, could be usedto improve a decomposition program.
It is very easy, forexample, for a decomposition program to decide erroneously thatacclamation is derived from clam, meaning roughly the result ofhaving been clammed up.
If the program could somehow splitthe Latinate and non-Latinate vocabularies, then the programcould know that -ation cannot be attached to clam because clamis not Latinate.
The program accomplishes this by maintaininga short list of words marked with an ad hoe feature \[-Latinate\].The program might perform even better if the Latinatevocabulary were split still further.
Consider, for example, thesplit between words ending with -ent and those ending with-ant.
The first class are likely to have variants ending with-ence and -ency and the second are likely to have variantsending with -ance and -ancy.
It seems extremely implausiblefor an -ent word such as president to take an -ant suffix:*presidant, *presidance, *presidancy.
Thus, it would bedesirable to partition the Latinate vocabulary into quite anumber of subsets, each with different possibilities forsuffixation.
But how do we do this without assigning ad hocfeatures uch as \[+Latinate\], \[+ent\], \[+ant\], \[+Declension 1\],\[+Declension 2\], etc.
?Not only is the feature approach ad hoc, but it also missing animportant asymmetry.
Note that most words ending with -ency(e.g., presidency) are derived from words ending with -ent (e.g.,president), and crucially not the other way around.
Theintuition that the relation "derived from" is asymmetric hassome distributional support: notice that the percentage of wordsending in -ency which are morphologically related to wordsending in -ent is much larger than the percentage of wordsending in -ent which are related to words ending in -ency.
(Theprogram estimates these percentages to be 73% (36/49) and 5%(36/710), respectively, using a procedure described below.
)This asymmetry is problematic for a concatenation model likeMITalk's Decomp, which would place presidency and presidenton equal footing, deriving both from preside.Aronoff-style \[Aronoff\] truncation rules provide an attractivemechanism for accounting for the asymmetry.
Recall thatAronoff proposed that nominee be derived from nominate bytruncating the -ate suffix and attaching -ee in a single step.These truncation rules were necessary for him so that he couldmaintain his Word Based Hypothesis.
The Word BasedHypothesis claims that words are formed from other words(possibly via truncation) and not from bound morphemes.
Thus,in Aronoff's theory, there is no bound morpheme nomin-; thereare only words (e,g., nominate and nominee).
Thegeneralizations that would be attributed to nomin- in other158theories are captured in Aronoff's system by his truncation rules,The program uses truncation rules to capture the symmetry inthe 'derived from' relation by permitting -ent to be truncatedbefore -ency, but not the other way around.
Thus, presidency isderived from president - -ent + -ency, and president is notderived from presidency because does not truncate -ency before-ent.
Truncation rules are subject to a number of constraints.In particular, truncation is only found at level 1; truncationcannot apply at level 2 because, as mentioned above, level 2affixes attach to words, not bound ( -  truncated) morphemes.How does the program decide which suffixes can be truncatedand when?
Let me introduce the notation -ency > -ent to mean(roughly) that words ending with -ency are likely to be derivedfrom words ending with -ent.
The precise status of the '> 'relation should be to be explored more fully.
In some cases, therelation is a necessary condition; if presidency is derived from anEnglish word then it must be derived from president.
In othercases, the relationship expresses a possibility but not a necessity.For example, words ending in -ation may be related to wordsending in -ate, but not necessarily.
Marchand describes therelation as follows:"The English vocabulary has been greatly enriched byborrowings, chiefly from Latin and French.
In course oftime, many related words which had come in as separateloans developed a derivational relation to each other, givingrise to derivative alternations.
Such derivative alternationsfall into three main groups.Group A is represented by the pairs 1) -acy / 2) -ate (aspiracy ~ pirate), 1) -ancy, -ency / 2) -ant, ent (asmilitancy ~ militant, decency ~ decent), 1) -ization / 2)-ize (as civilization ~ civilize), 1) -ification I 2) -ify (asidentification ~ identify), 1) -ability / 2) -able (asrespectibility ~ respectible), 1) -ibility /2) -ible as(convertibility ~ convertible), 1) -ician / 2) -it(s) (asstatistician ~ statistics), 1) -icity / 2) -ic (as catholicitycatholic), 1) -inity / 2) -ine (salinity ~ saline).If 1) is a derivation from an English word, the only possibleword is 2), ie., if piracy is a derivative from an Englishword, only pirate is possible.
The statement does not implythat for every 1) there must be a 2).
1) may be a loan, orit may be formed on a Latin basis without any regard to theexistence of an English word at all (enormity, for instance,is so coined).
Nor does the derivational principle involvethe existence of a 1) for every 2) (many words in -able or-ine are not matched by words in -ability resp.
-inity).Group B is represented by the pairs 1) -ation / 2) -ate (ascreation ~ create), 1) -(e)ry / 2) -er (as carpentrycarpenter), 1) -cress / 2) -erer (as murderessmurderer), 1) -ious / 2) -ion (as ambitious ~ ambition, 1)-atious / 2) -ation (as vexatious ~ vexation).If 1) is a derivative from another English word, thederivational pattern 1) from 2) is possible, but notnecessary.
A derivative in -ation such as reforestation isconnected with reforest, a derivative such as swannery isconnected with swan, archeress is connected with archer,robustious is extended from robust (but otherwise an adj in-tious derived from a sb points to the sb ending in -tion, i.e.we have really type A).Group C is nothing but a variant of A and concerns adjs in-atious as flirtatious.
Originally deriving from sbs in-ation, the type is now equally connected with theunextended radical, i.e.
flirt (the older derivationostentatious 1658 has not entered this latter derivationalconnection)."
\[Marchand, pp.
165-166\]For pragmatic purposes, the program assumes that there is onlyone '> '  relation, not three as Marchand suggests, and that therelation can be estimated statistically as follows:Probability (suffix I > suffix 2)-number of words ending with both suffiX l and suffix2number of words ending with suffix lThe program estimates, for example, that -ency > -ent with aprobability of 73% (36/49) and that -ent > -ency with aprobability of 5% (36/710).
The 36 words ending in ency whichhave a variant ending in -ent are: incumbency, complacency,indecency, excrescency, residency, presidency ascendency,dependency, independency, superintendency, despondency,exigency contingency, emergency, detergency, insurgency,deficiency, efficiency sufficiency, proficiency, expediency,clemency, permanency, transparency vicegerency, belligerency,currency, competency, prepotency, consistency inconsistency,frequency, delinquency, constituency, solvency and fervency.The estimate should be almost 100%; the program believes thatdecency, cadency, tendency, ambitendency, pudency, agency,regency, urgency, counterinsurgency, valency, patency, potency,and fluency are not derived from -ent.
Most of the errors canbe attributed to a heuristic which excludes short stems (e.g.,ag-) on the grounds that these stems are often spurious.
Theseerrors could be fixed by ammending the heuristic to check a'winners list' of one, two and three letter stems.
Some of theother errors are due to accidental gaps in the dictionary.The results of this statistical estimation are shown in the figurebelow (where -0 denotes the null

Consider the wordpresidency.
The program notices that this word ends in -ency soit looks in the table and discovers that -ency alternates with -ent(73%), -ence (24%), -e (14%) and -0 (12%).
The program triesto replace the -ency with each of these sequentially until it findsa word in the dictionary.
In this case, it will succeed on the firsttry when it replaces -ency with -ent and finds that the resultpresident is a word in the dictionary.Level 1 prefixes are processed through an analogous procedure,so that effect, for example, is derived from defect by truncatingthe ef- prefix and adding the prefix de-.
The truncationmechanism is not generally employed by most authors forprefixing, and it may be a mistake to do so, but I used itanyways, mostly because it was available and filled a practicalneed.The resulting decomposition program has been used to constructa forest of related words as illustrated below:( 38 port( aport )(comport (cosportmtnt))(deport (depoEtatlon) (doporCee)( doper  tment  ) )( disport )(export (exportation) (reexport))(import (important (importance))(importation) (relmport))(portable)(portage)(portal)(por ta t ive)(por tent  (por tentous)  )( portion( apport ion (appor t ionment )(reapportlon (reapportionment)))(proportlon (disproportlon( disproportionate(dlspzoportionation) )(pzoportional)(proportionate) ) )( report ( reportage ) )(transport (transportation)) )(36  in fec t(a f fec t  (a f fec ta t ion)(a?

These results seemsextremely promising; most of the relations appear to agree veryclosely with intuition.Now that we have a fairly accurate method of decomposingwords at level 1, how can this be put to practical use'?.
Forassigning stress, it would be useful to know the weight of thesyllables in the stem.
This is particularly necessary before so-called weak retraction suffixes (e.g., -ent, -ant, -ence, -able,ance, al, ous, ary).
General principles of stress retraction (e.g.,\[Liberman and Prince\]), predict strong retractors (e.g., -ate,-ation) always back the stress up regardless of syllable weight(degrhde I d~gradation), whereas weak retractors do so only ifthe preceding syllable is light (refir / rkferent with a lightsyllable before -ent, as opposed to (cohkre /cohkrent with aheavy syllable before -ent).Given syllable weight, it is relatively well-understood how toassign stress.
A large number of phonological studies (e.g.,\[Chomsky and Halle\], \[Liberman and Prince\], \[Hayes\]) outlinea deterministic procedure for assigning stress from the weightrepresentation a d the number of extrametrical syllables (1 fornouns, 0 for verbs).
A version of this procedure wasimplemented by Richard Sproat last summer, and was discussedat the last ACL meeting \[Church\].It it generally believed that syllable weight is derivable fromunderlying vowel length and the number of consonants, but ifone is trying to assign stress from the spelling, it can be difficultto know the vowel length and the number of consonants.
Thefact that inhence has a heavy penultimate syllable and that~nference has a light penultimate syllable is extremely difficult todetermine from the spelling.
It would be considerably easier ifsyllable weight (or some correlate thereof such as vowel length)were marked in a lexicon of stems, so that the program coulddetermine syllable weight by decomposing a word into its peices,look them up in a morpheme lexicon, and then re-combine theresults appropriately.Not only is it convenient for practical application to assume thatstems are marked in the lexicon for syllable weight, but it maybe necessary for linguistic reasons as well.
Consider the stressalternation confide I confidence.
This alternation is problematicbecause the i in confide seems to be underlyingly long whereasthe i in confidence seems to be underlyingly short, and yet, the161two stems ought to share the same underlying form since thetwo words are morphologically related to one another.
Thesolution to the confidence puzzle, I believe, is to say that thestem -fide is marked in the lexicon as underlyingly light at leastwith respect o stress retraction (and to account for the tensevowel in confide in some other way \[Church (forthcoming)\]).The table below is presented as evidence that the confidencealternation is determined, at least in part, by some sort of lexicalmarking on stems.
Note, for example, that -fer, -cel, -side, and-fide words display the confidence alternation, but -here, -pel,and -pose words do not.alternationno alternationrefer referenceconfer conferenceinfer inferencedefer deferenceexcel excellent excellence excellencyreside resident residencypreside president presidencyconfide confident confidence confidencyadhere adherent adherence adhesivecohere coherent coherence cohesiveinhere inherent inherence inhesionexpel expellent expellantrepel repellentpropel propellent propellantexpose exposal exposure expositorydispose disposal disposure dispositorypropose proposalcompose composureAssume the lexicon divides stems into at least two classes:?

Retraction Class II Stems (heavy): -here, -pel, -pose, -hale,-pale, -grade, -vade, -flame, -suade, -place, -plore, -void,-clude, -prove,-sume, -fuse, -ducewhere class I stems show stress alternations before weakretracting suffixes and class II stems do not.This concludes what I wanted to say about level 1decomposition.
In summary, this section presented Aronoff-styletruncation rules as an alternative to MITalk-style concatenationrules.
Truncation rules hav.e the advantage that they preservethe asymmetry in the 'derived from' relation, and that theycorrectly partition the lexicon into classes such as \[+ent\] and\[+ant\] without introducing unnecessary ad hoc features uch as\[+ent\] and \[+ant\].
Some results of the new decompositionprocedure were presented, and they seem to agree very closelywith intuition.
It was suggested that the decompositionprocedure could be used in stress assignment, by decomposingwords into morphemes, look up the syllable weight of the piecesin a morpheme lexicon, and then recombine the resultsappropriately.
This last suggestion has not yet been fullyimplemented.5.
Level 2 and CompoundingMost of the linguistic literature deals with level 1 where we findextremely interesting stress alternations and vowel shifts and soforth.
Generally speaking, the phonology of level 2 andcompounding is believed to be relatively fairly straightforward.Something like the simple concatenation model in decomp is nota bad first approximation.
In fact, I believe the stress of level 2and compounding is more interesting than has generally beenthought.
In particular, I am beginning to believe that level 2affixes are not stress neutral at all, but rather they stress as ifthey were parts of compounds.
Note that under-, anti- andsuper- follow the general compound pattern where stress isassigned the to the left member in nouns and to the right inverbs and adjectives.Noun Verb Adjectivetlnderdog underg6 under~.ge~.ntifreeze antis6cialstlpermarket superimp6se supers6nic6.
Are Level 2 Affixes Really Stress Neutral?It might be possible to extend this position to its logical extremeand say that all level 2 affixes stress like compounds, and thuscompletely do away with the concept of stress neutral affixes.?
Compound Theory: (All) Level 2 affixes are stressed just likecompounds; they receive main stress on the left in nouns andmain stress on the right in verbs and adjectives.?
Stress Neutral Theory: (At least some) Level 2 affixes arestress neutral; they are simply concatenated onto the stem (a1~.
MITalk's Decomp).The compound theory has much to recommend it.
Indeed mostlevel 2 prefixes are like under-, anti- and super- and show thecompound stress pattern (stress on the left when nominal and onthe right when verbal/adjectival).
These prefixes cannot beaccounted for easily under the stress neutral theory.
The mainsupport for the stress neutral theory seems to come from prefixeslike un- which (almost) never take the main stress.
However,un- can also be accounted for under the compound theory bynoting that un- forms adjectives and verbs, and therefore mainstress would fall on the right.Admittedly, there are a number of nominal compounds likepro-life and anti-abortion which take right stress, presumablybecause the semantics of the left member takes on a semi-adjectival status.
Notice, for example, that the word antimatter162has two stress patterns, one with main stress on the left and onewith main stress on the right, just like well-known compoundblackboard.
With left stress, the compound takes non-compositional semantics and with right stress the compound hasa more compositional meaning.
These facts suggest that thecompound theory can be maintained to acocunt for cases likepro-life, but only if the compound stress rules are refined takethe semantic facts into account.Level 2 suffixes provide additional support for the compoundtheory.
Consider suffixes like ment, hood, ship and ness whichappear to support the the stress neutral theory because theynever receive main stress.
But, they can also be accounted forunder the compound theory because they form nouns, andtherefore the main stress would be expected to fall on the left.Moreover, consider the level 2 adjectival suffixes -istic and-mental.
These suffixes refute the stress neutral theory becausethey take the main stress, but they are no problem for thecompound stress theory which predicts that adjectivialcompounds should receive main stress on the right.7.
The Super-Puzzle and Compound StressIn attempting to include prefixes as a subcase of compoundstress, I did stumble over a very interesting problem in thetheory of compound stress.
Consider the contrast betweensl~perconductor and shperconductlvity.
Although bothcompounds are nominal, the first takes primary stress on the leftmember and the second takes stress on the right member.
Uponfurther investigation, it appears than many compounds endingwith level 1 suffixes.
(e.g., -ity, -ation) take primary stress onthe right member.
For example, here is a breakdown ofcompounds ending with the letters ion.
Note the strongtendency for primary stress to end up on the right member.

Left-Dominant: intersession, outstation, midsection?
Right-Dominant: intercommunion, supervision, anteversion,intercession, supersession, intermission, echolocation, inter-columniation, contravallation, overpopulation, interlunation,intermigration, overcompensation, aftersensation, super-fetation, superelevation, interaction, intersection, contra-distinction, superinduction, superconduction, underproduct-ion, contraposition, superposition, interposition, postposition,interlocution, counterrevolution?
Neither: tourbillion, interrogation, foreordination,redintegration forestation, electrodeposition 3Thus, it appears that compounds ending with a level 1 suffixtake right stress.
If correct, however, the generalization is apuzzle for the level ordering hypothesis, which assumes that thestress rules of level 1 are opaque to the stress rules of level 2and compounding.
In other words, level ordering suggests astructure like super\[conductivity\] where level 1 takes precedenceover level 2 and compounding, but stress assignment requires adifferent structure \[superconductive\]ity where the compoundstress rule applies before the level 1 suffix is analyzed.1.
These suffixes cannot be level 1, because they don't force the secondarystress to fall two syllables before the main stress: *dbpartmbntal (cf..dbgrad\[ttion).In this sense, words like superconductivity are very much likethe well-known bracketing paradox ungrammaticality, wherelevel ordering suggests one structure un\[grammaticality\] (un# isa level 2 prefix which must scope outside of +ity with is a level1 prefix) and syntactic/semantic interpretation (LF) requiresanother \[ungrammatical\]ity (un# attaches to adjectives and notto nouns).
Note that stress assignment seems to side with thesyntactic/semantic arguments in suggesting a left branchingstructure that violates level ordering.A solution to these bracketting paradoxes becomes apparentwhen we consider nominal Greek compounds like psychobiologywith three or more morphemes.

Thus, psycho\[biology\] takes mainstress on the biology because it is branching.Let me suggest further that this same sort of explanation mightcarry over to explain the stress in the bracketting paradoxessuch as superconductivity and ungrammaticality where I claimthat the right piece is 'branching' in order to account for thefact that main stress ends up on the right half.

ConclusionTwo new ideas in machine morphological decomposition werepresented.
The discussion of level 1 proposed the application ofAronoff-style truncation rules as an effective means to capturethe asymmetry in the 'derived from' relation.
Secondly, thediscussion of level 2 proposed ideas from the literature oncompound stress as an alternative to the stress neutral approachtaken in MITalk's Decomp.ReferencesAronoff, M., Word Formation in Generative Grammar, MITPress, Cambridge, MA., 1976.Allen, J., Carlson, R., Granstrom, B., Hunnicutt, S., Klatt, D.,Pisoni, D., Conversion of Unrestricted English Text to Speech,incomplete draft, undergroland press, 1979.Chomsky, N., and Halle, M., The Sound Pattern of English,Harper and Row, 1968.Church, K., Stress Assignment in Letter to Sound Rules forSpeech Synthesis, in Proceedings of the Association forComputational Linguistics, 1985.Church, K., The Confidence Puzzle and Underlying Quantity,forthcoming.Hayes, B., A Metrical Theory of Stress Rules, Ph.D. Thesis,MIT, 1980.Liberman, M., and Prince, A., On Stress and LinguisticRhythm, Linguistic Inquiry 8, pp.

The problem is to define 'branching' so that it gets the right results.
1don't want to say that superconductor is branching, because that wouldincorrectly predict main stress on conductor.
I don't know how to definebranching to achieve the desired results, though 1 believe that thi~approach is extremely promising.164
