In the exper-iments, we basically examined the occur-rence of zero anaphors in a real text and theones generated by the algorithms employingthe rules, assuming the same semantic anddiscourse structures as the text.
The fac-tors of locality, syntactic constraints, dis-course structure and salience of objectswere considered in the rules.
The results ofthe experiment show that 93% of the zeroanaphors in the text can be correctly gener-ated by an algorithm using a rule involvingall the above factors.1 I n t roduct ionAnaphoric expressions in Chinese can be classified aszero, pronominal and nominal forms, as exemplified in(1) by ?~, ta I (tie) and nage ren I (that person), respec-tively.(1)a.

Although there is no clearrule to account for zero anaphora, nevertheless, aspointed out by Li and Thompson, zero anaphora com-inonly occur in the situation of a "topic chain," wherea referent is referred to in the first clause, and then sev-eral more clauses follow talking about the same refer-cut but with it omitted.
In \[Chen 87\], Chen proposedthe notion of "contimfity" of referent in discourse togive a more specific account of zero auaphora.In this paper, we aim at deciding when to generatezcro anaphors from some internal semantic strueturc.Although there are no clear rules stated in previouslinguistic work, we, nevertheless, cau summarize a verysimple rule, R.ule 1 as shown below, for the generationof zero anaphors.Ru le  1: if an entity, c, in the current ut-terance was referred to in the immediatelypreceding utterance, then a zero anaplior isused for c; otherwise a non-zero anaphor isused.We, performed at\] experiment by comparing the zeroanaphors generated by the algorithm employing thisrule and those occurring in real text to see how wellit works.
The initial result showed that zero anaphorswere over-generated to a large extent in the text pro-duced by employing Rule l. Consequently, we con-sidered other well-known factors namely, syntacticconstraints \[Li and Thompson 81\], discourse structure\[Grosz and Sidner 86\] and the salience ofobjecl, s in utteranees \[Sidner 83\], to get better results.2 Exper imentA number of articles written by different authors wereselected as the linguistic sources with which the textproduced by employing the generat, ion algorithms canbe compared.
For the moment, the selected articles arerestricted to the exposition type, namely, ones whichexplain an idea or discuss a problem.
Two sets ofdata were selected; one consists of a nunlber of scien-tiff(: questions and answers for children and the ol~heris a brief introduction to modern Chinese grammar.Basically the experiment was executed in three steps.First, zero anaphors within the selected articles wereidentiffed.
Second, h)r each paragraph in the selected732articles, we examined each utterance sequentially nndrecorded the occurrence of zero anaphors that wouhlbe obtained by applying the algorithm using a rule,like Rule 1.
Third, we noted down the dilfcrenees be-tween the results of stel)s 1 nnd 2.In step 3, we categorized the differences betweea theresults ms: correct, fitlse and missiug types.
If a refer-enee created by the algorithm is the same as tile onein the real text, then it belongs to the correct type.If a zero anat>hor is created by the algorithm, whilethe corresponding position in the real text is non-zeroannphol', then it belongs to the false type.
Conversely,if a zero nnaphor is found in some position in the realtext, while a non-zero anaphor is created by the algo=rithm, then it t>elongs to the missiT~g type.
The taskof step 3 is to eonnt the re,tuber of cases in each type.3 Resu l tsl lnving clone this, we carried oat similar experimentswith enhanced rules.3.1 Etfeet  of  us ing  l~ule 1 and  add ingsyntact i c  const ra in tsIn Sets 1 ;rod 2 of tire testing data, there are 651 and149 anaphors, respectively, liy using the algorithlnof Rule t on the data, the result is shown iu TaMe1.
In tire data, 7 and 1 long distaace zero anaphorsoccur but the algorithm decides to use non-zero ouesfor the corresponding positions.
()onsequently, theybelong to the missing tyl>e.
Frnm the result shown inTable 1, the performance of the algorithm is olwiouslyunpromising.There  are cer ta in  syntact i c  coustrai lH;s oil zeroanaphorn, regardless of discourse factors, as shown in\[Li and Thoml)SOn 79, Li and '\['hompson 81\],.
There-fore, we enhanced R,uh: 1 by adding the above syntactic constraints on zero annphora, which I)ecomes l(,ulcIn as below.
Rule la  can be alternntively I>e repre-sented as a decision tree iu Fig.

l/ence, in this subsection, we em-ploy the idea or (lisCOllrse structure to improw~ ouralgorithm lbr the generation of zero anaphors.In their study \[Li and Thompson 7!/\], IA and'rhompson propose that "the degree of preference forthe occurrence of 1)rononfinal nnaphora in a clause inversely correspon(Is to the degrc'e of connection withthe preceding clause."
They listed the tollowing c(m-ditions of decreasing of commction: switching frombackground to lk)regrotmd information, or vice versa,between two clauses, the second clause headed by a,nadverhial expression and two clauses spokel~ by twodilD.rent participants.In gel ,eral ,  a zero a l lap l |o r  | lsed to l'et'el" to SOil+(':enl,ity in the previous utterance might he i;xpccted toindicate the contimlation of ~ discourse segment, whilea lion-zero nnnphor occurring in the same situation sig-nals n boundary of discourse segment.
From the.
gem~r-.ator's perspe.ctive, when the decision of the anaphoricform tbr a phrase referring to some entity in tile pro-.vious utterance is t,o be made., the factor of discoursesegment boundary l|n|st be taken inl,o consideration.Therefore, based on this idea, we improve the previousruh'.s for generation of zero anaphors, ll,ules land  l a,to make the following rule.

Therefore, we annotated the boundariesbetween discourse segments in the testing data andthe hierarchical discourse structures according to thediscourse segment intentions.
We farther carried outa test by comparing our annotations with other nativespeakers of Chinese.
In the test, four native speakersof Chinese were asked to do the same tasks we havedone for five articles selected from the testing data.Comparing with the speakers' results, on average 76%of the speakers' annotations coincide with ours.
Ac-cording to the ahove comparison the annotations wemade were reliable for the purpose of the experiment.We then performed the experiment by employingthe algorithm of Rule 2.
As shown in Table 2, for the.Set 1 data, 49 and 12 zero anaphors were over- aIMunder-generated by the algorithm, respectively.
Forthe other set of testing data, Rule 2 achieves an evenbetter result.Table 2: The results of the algorithm ofRule 2.I set A!g' \ [ ~ ~$2 R23.3 The  effect of  top icIn this snbsection, we use the feature of topic in Chi-nese to further refine the i)revious rifles.
The basicidea here is to investigate the positions of antecedentand anaphor in their respective utterances.
In the fol-lowing, we divided the position of anapbors in their re-spective utterances into topic and non-topic.
For eachanaphor, its antecedent's position is one of the follow-ing categories: topic, direct object or the NP followinga presentative verb and others.
We thus classify thefollowing types, A to F, of antecedent-anaphor pairs:the antecedents of Types A and C are ill topic position,of B and D are in direct object position or are the NPfollowing a presentative verb, and of E and F are inother positions; the anaphors of Types A, B and E arcin topic position, and of C, D and F are in non-topicpositions.Since in the new rule conditions on topic and non-topic will only be considered after the conditions inRnle 2, in investigating the antecedcnt-anaphor pairs,we have to exclude the ones with either their anaphorsviolating syntactic constraints on zero anaphor or atthe beginning of discourse segments.
In other words,the new condition will be attached under the Z-nodein the decision tree of Fig.
2.
In the Set 1 test, lagdata, there are 239 such pairs, among which anaphorsof 49 pairs are zeroed by the algorithm of Rule 2 butappear in non-zero forms in the text.
In other words,the 49 anaphors were over-generated byonr algoritbm,which in our terms belong to the false type; the other190 cases belong to the correct type.
The number ofeach type of pairs for both correct and over-generatedcases in the testing data are shown in Table 3.Table 3: Occurrence of antecedent-anaphorpairs in th0.

Thus, if we let anaphors of Types A andB be zero and Types C and E non-zero, then therewill be 29 (15+14) over-generated zero anaphors and 5(l-t-4) under-generated ones for the Set 1 testing data.The numhers for Types D and F do not conclusivelysupport eitber usir, g zero or non-zero in this case.
InChen's study \[Chen 87\], he fonnd a higher percentageof zero anaphors occurring in the topic position withtheir antecedent most frequently in the topic or objectpositions of the immediately previous utterance, whichstrongly supports the idea of letting anaphors of TypesA arm B be zero and others non-zero.
We choose togenerate non-zero anaphora for Types D and F. ~?W;thus obtain Rule 3 by adding the.
affect of topic intoRule 2.

The results of using the new algorithm are sllownin Table 4.Ru le  3: if an entity, e, in the current ut,-terance, u, was referred to in the immedi-ately preceding utterance, does not violateany syntactic onstraints on zero anaphora,and u is not at tim beginning of a discom'se734violates syntactic NZconstraints?

Z, N and 1' representzero, pronominal and nominal anaphors, respectively.Indicated in the root node are the total number ofall kinds of anaphors in the data.
The corr'ect matchis calculated by summing up the numbers of non:zero anaphors, pronouns and nominal anaphors, undernon-zero leaf nodes and zero anaphors under zero leafnodes.
Non-zero anaphors under zero leaf nodes arethe false matches.
Conversely, zero anaphors undernon-zero leaf nodes arc the missing matches.4 Future WorkIn this paper, we focus on distinguishing zero and non-zero anaphors.
To have a full account for anaphorsin Chinese, two tasks remain to be done.
The firstis to distinguish pronouns and nominal anaphors fortile non-zero cases, namely, to fm'ther add conditionsunder the non-zero nodes in the decision tree of Fig.3.
'l'he second tmsk is to develop an algorithm \['or thedecision of an appropriate form for nominal amtphors\[Dale 92, Reiter and l)ale 92\].
