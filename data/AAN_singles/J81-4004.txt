Technical CorrespondenceOn the  Need for  Pars ing  I l l - Formed InputKwasny and Sondheimer (1981) present echniquesfor handling several types of il l-formed input withinthe context of augmented transition networks.
Suchapproaches are necessary if natural language under-standing systems are to handle the full range of inputto be expected from users.
We present here somestatistics which illustrate the magnitude of this prob-lem; almost one third of the queries collected in anatural language processing1981) contain problems of theThey consider three classesexperiment (McLean,sort they describe.of il l-formed input: (1)co-occurrence violations, (2) ellipsis and extraneousterms, and (3) conjunction.
A co-occurrence violationresults from a problem such as lack of agreement.Ellipsis is the omission of some of the words requiredfor a complete sentence; this problem is grouped to-gether with the problem of extraneous terms, in whichunnecessary words are used.
The use of conjunction isnot ungrammatical, but it is included in their classifica-tion because similar techniques can be used to handleit.Kwasny and Sondheimer present limited evidencewhich indicates the importance of these problems.However, different studies are cited for each of thethree problem classes, and not all of them are from thecontext of natural language understanding systems.In an experiment designed to test the influence ofexperience level on the types of queries posed to anatural language understanding system, three groups ofstudent subjects were asked to compose simple Englishsentences requesting personnel information from adatabase.
Since many of the 693 queries collectedwere not complete sentences in standard English, thetypes of errors made were analyzed.Co-occurrence violations were found in 12.3% ofthe queries.
The most common such problems wereincorrectly formed possessives and lack of agreementbetween subject and verb.
Extraneous terms and el-lipsis were observed in 14.0% of the queries; the useof ellipsis was far more common than the appearanceof extraneous terms.
Conjunctions were found in11.4% of the queries.
At least one of these problemswas found in 32.8% of the queries.
