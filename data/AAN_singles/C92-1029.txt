jpAbstractParsing a long sentence is very difficult, since longsentences often have conjunctions which result in am-biguities.
If the conjunctive structures existing in along sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguitiescan be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsedin a high successful rate.
Since the prior part andthe posterior part of a conjunctive structure have asimilar structure very often, finding two similar seriesof words is an essential point in solving this problem.Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated andthen the two series of words which have the great-est sum of similarities are found by a technique ofdynamic programming.
We deal with not only con-junctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predica-tive clauses created by "Renyoh chuushi-ho".
We willillustrate the effectiveness of this method by the anal-ysis of 180 long Japanese sentences.1 IntroductionAnalysis of a long Japanese sentence is one of manydifficult problems which cannot be solved by the con-tinuing efforts of many researchers and remain abau-doned.
It is difficult to get a proper analysis of asentence whose length is more than fifty Japanesecharacters, and almost all the analyses fail for sen-tences composed of more than eighty characters.
Toclarify why it is is also very difficult because thereare varieties of reasons for the failures.
People some-times say that there are so many possibilities of modi-fier/modifyee relations between phrases in a long sen-tence.
But no deeper consideration has ever beengiven for the reasons of the analysis failure.
Analysisfailure here means not only that no correct analysisis included in the multiple analysis results which arecaused by the intrinsic ambiguity of a sentence andalso by inaccurate grammatical rules, but also thatthe analysis fails in the middle of the analysis pro-re88,We have been claiming that many (more than two)linguistic omponents are to be seen at the same timein a sentence for proper parsing, and also that tree totree transformation is necessary for reliable analysisof a sentence.
Popular grammar ules which mergetwo linguistic components into one are quite insuf-ficient to describe the delicate relationships amongcomponents ill a long sentence.Language is complex.
There often happens thatcomponents whicb are far apart  in a long sentence co-occur, or have certain relationships.
Such relationsmay be sometimes purely semantic, but often theyare grammatical or structural, although they are notdefinite but very subtle.A long sentence, particularly of Japanese, con-tains parallel structures very often.
They are ei-ther conjunctive noun phrases, or conjunctive pred-icative clauses.
The latter is called "Renyoh chuushi-ho".
They appear in an embedded sentence to mod-ify nouns, and also are used to connect wo or moresentences.
This form is very often used in Japanese,and is a main cause for structural ambiguity.
Manymajor sentential components are omitted in the pos-terior part of Renyoh chuushi expressions and thismakes the analysis more difficult.For tbc successful analysis of a long Japanese sen-tence, these parallel phrases and clauses, includingRenyoh chuushi-ho, must be recognized correctly.This is a key point, and this must be achieved bya completely different method from the ordinary syn-tactic analysis methods, because they generally failin the analysis for a long sentence.We have introduced au assumption that these par-allel phrases/clauses have a certain similarity, andhave developed an algorithm which finds out a mostplausible two series of words which can be consideredparallel by calculating a similarity measure of two ar-bitrary series of words.
This is realized by using thedynamic programming method.
The results was ex-ceedingly good.
We achieved the score of about 80%in the detection of various types of parallel series ofwords in long Japanese sentences.2 Types of Conjunctive Struc-tures and Their AmbiguitiesFirst, we will explain what kind of conjunctivestructures (hereafter abbreviated as 'CS ' )  appear inJapanese\[ l \ ]N.The first type is con junct ive  nomi  phrases .

KB lies lastin the prior part of at CS, but it is difficult to determine which bunsetsu sequences on both side of tileKB constitute a CS.
That  is, it is not easy to deter-mine which Imnsetsu to tile hfft of a KII is tile leftmostelement of the prior part of a CS, and which bunsetsuto the.
right of a Kil is tile r ightmost element of theposterior part of a US.
The bunsetsus betweeu thesetwo extreme elements constitute the scope o f  theCS.
Particularly in detecting this scope of a CS, it isessential to find out the last Imnsetsn in the posteriorpart of the CS, which corresponds to the KB.

Then we calculate similarities of allpairs of ~)unsetsus ill a selltence, and calculate a sumof similarities between a series of bunsetsus on theleft of a KII and a series of bunsetsus on the left ofa CB.
Of all the pairs of the two series of Imnsetsus,the pair which has the greatest sum of similarities isdetermined as the scope of the CS.

Add points for semantic similarities by usingthe thesaurus 'Buurui Goi Ityou' (BGH)\[3\].BGH has the six layer abstraction hierarchyand more than 60,000 words are assigned to theleaves of it.
If the most specific common layerbetween two IWs is the k-th layer and if k isgreater than 2, add (k - 2) ?
2 points.
If ei-ther or both IWs are not contained in BGH, noaddition is made.
Matching of the generic twolayers are ignored to prevent too vague match-ing in broader sense.4.
If some of AWs (accompanying words) matcb,add the number of matchin$ AWs x 3 points.Maximum sum of the similarity values which canbe added by the steps 2 and 3 above is limited to10 points.?
Although the parts of speech oflWs are not equal,give 2_.points if both bunsetsus can be predicate(see footnote 1).For example, the similarity point between " ~~Pi~ (low level language) +," and " ~ l t?
,~ '~ (highlevel language) + ~ (and)" is calculated as 2(match ofparts of speech) + 8(match of four characters: Y~l/t~~)  = 10 points.

Thesetwo aeries of bunsetsus are searched for on a triangu-lar matrix A = (a(i, j)) (Figure 1), whose diagonale lement  a(i,i) is the i-th bunsetsu in a sentence andwhose element a(i , j )  (i < j) is the similarity valuebetween bunsetsu a(i,i) and bunsetsu a(j , j ) .We call the rectangular matrix A' a part ia l  ma-tr ix,  whereA' =(a( i , j ) )  (O< i< n; n+ l < j <1)t,(i, ~3~ .......... i'---~i, j-I )-~i, 9" J  .....

In tilefollowing, 1 indicates the number of bunsetsus anda(n, n) is a KB.
We define a path  as a series of ele-ments from a non-zero element in the lowest row toan element in the leftmost column of a partial matrix(Figure 1).path ::=(a(pl, m), a(p2 .

O, Pi = n,PI>>.PI+I( 1 <i<m-n-  1).The starting element of a path shows the correspon-dence of a KB to a CB.
A path has only one elementfrom eacb column and extends towards the upper left.We calculate the similarity between tbe series ofbunsetsus on the left side of the path (sbl in Figure1) and the series under the path (sb2 in Figure 1) asa path  score by the following four criteria:1.
Basically the score of a path is tile sum of eachelement's points on the path.
But if a part of thepath is horizontal (a( i , j ) ,a( i , j  - 1)) as shown inFigure 2, which leads the bunsetsu correspondenceof one element a(i, i) to two elements a( j -  1, j -  1)and a(j , j ) ,  the element's points a(i, j  - 1) is notadded to the path score.2.
Since a pair of conjunctive phrases/clanses oftenappear ~s a similar structure, it is likely thatboth cmdunctive phrases/clauses contain nearlythe same numbers of bunsetsus.
Therefore, weimpose penalty points on the pair of elementsin the path which causes the one-to-plural bun-setsu correspondence so as to give a priority tothe CS of the same size.

Since each phrase in the CS has a certain cO-herency of meaning, speciM words which separatethe meaning in a sentence often limit the scope ofa CS.
If a path includes such words, we imposepenalty points on the path so that the fmssihil -ity of including those are reduced.
We define five'separating-levels' (SLs) for hunsetsus, which ex-press the strength of separating a sentence mean-ing (Table 3, of.
Tahle 1).
If bunsetsus on the leftside of the path ~md under it include a bunsetsuwhose SL is equal to KB's SI, or higher than it,we reduce the path score by(SL of the hunsetsu - KB's SL + 1) x 7.ltowever, two high SL bunsetsus correspondingto each other ofteu exist in a CS, and those donot limit the scope of the CS.
For example, topic-marking postpositional particles correspond eachother in the following sentential style,h ~.
L 'C  ~ (As  to  A) .
.
.
.
-cab 9 (be),f~ ~ L~c ~ (~s to ~l) .
.
.
.
- c .~  (~e).Therefore, when two high SL bunsetsus corre-spond in a CS, that is, the path includes the ele-ment which indicates the similarity of them, andthose are the 'same-type',  the penalty points onthem arc not axlded to tile path score.
We definethc same-type bunsetsus ~LS two bunsetsus whichsatisfy the following two conditions.?
IWs of them are of the same part of speech, andthey have the identical inflection whcn they arcinflectional words.?
AWs of them arc identical.Table 4: Words for honuses.~ll~t A - tA~ (~Josjultctive noun phrases4.
Some words frequently become tile AW of the lastbunsetsu in a CS or the IW following it.
Thesewords thus signal the end of the CS.
Such wordsare shown in Table 4, Bonus points (6 points) aregiven to the path which indicates the CS endingwith one of the words in Table 4, as that pathshouhl he preferred.3.3  F ind ing  the  Con junct ive  S t ruc -tu re  ScopeAs for each non-zero element in the lowest row ill apartial matr ix A' in Figure l, we search for tile bestpath from it which has the greatest path score by atechnique of the dynamic programming.

60 sentenceswhich are longer aud more complex than the aver-age sentences are collected from each of the followingthree sources; Encyclopedic Dictionary of ComputerScience (EDCS) published by lwanami PublishingCo., Abstracts of papers of Japan Information Cen-ter of Science and Technology (JICST), and popularscience journal, "Science", translated into Japanese(Vol.17,No.12 "Advanced Computing for Science").Each group of 60 sentences consists of 20 sentencesfrom 30 to 50 characters, 20 sentences from 50 to 80characters, and 20 sentences over 80 characters.As described in the preceding sections, many fac-tors have effects on the analysis of CSs, and it is veryimportant o adjust the weights for each factor.
Themethod of calculating the path score was adjustedduring the experiments on 30 sentences out of 60 sen-tences from EDCS.
Then the other 150 sentences areanalyzed by these parameters.
As the analyses weresuccessful as shown in the following, this method canbe regarded as properly representing the balancedweights on each factor.This method defines where the CS ends, that is,which bunsetsu corresponds to the KB.
However, asfor conjunctive noun phrases containing clause mod-ifiers or conjunctive predicative clauses, it is almostimpossible to find out exactly where the CS starts, be-cause mm~y bunsetsus which modify right-hand bun-setsus exist in each part of the CSs and usnally theydo not correspond exactly.
Thus it is necessary to re-vise the start ing position of the CS obtained by thismethod.
We treat the actual prior part of a CS asextending to bunsetsus which modify a bunsetsu inthe prior part of it obtained by this method, unlessthey contain comma or topic-marking postpositionalparticle " #2 "(ha).4 .1  Examples  o f  Cor rect  Ana lys i sExamples of correct analysis are shown in Figure 6-8.

The results of cvaluatlug every sen-tence by each CS type are shown in Table 5.
If tilesame typc CSs exist two or more ill a sentence, theanalysis is regarded as a success only when all of themare analyzed rightly.There arc 144 conjunctive noun phrases ill 180 sen-tences, and l l9  phrases among them are analyzedrightly.
Tbe success ratio is 83%.
There are 118 con-junctive predicative clauses ill 180 sentences, and 94clauses among them are analyzed rightly.
The suc-cess ratio is 80%.
There are 3 pairs of the conjunctiveincomplete structures, and all of them are analyzedrightly.As showu in \] 'able 5, the sucecss rate for tile Sell-tences from J1CST abstracts arc worse than that ofthe sentences from other sources.
The reason for thefailures is that tile sentences are often very ambiguousand confusing even for a lluman because they have toomany contents in a sentence to satisfy the l imitationof tile docnment size.4.3 Examples  o f  Incor rect  Ana lys i sand Solut ions for ThemWc give examples of failure of analysis (Table 6, Fig-urc 9), and indicate st)lutions for them.

It is essential i l this method to define the appro-priate similarity between words.
Thus changingthe sinlilarity points for more detailed groups ofparts of speech (e,g.
nouns call be divided intoilul~lerals~ proper nonns, conlmon nouns, and ac-tion nouns which becomc verbs by the combiua-tion with " ~-~ (do)") can improve the accuracyof the anMysis.
For example, the example(i) in'Fable 6 may bc analyzed rightly if the similar-ity points between action noun "t1~\[~ (extension)"and action noun " t~ ' f  (maintenance)" is greaterthan that between action noun " t1~ (extension)"and common noun " ~1~ (di~cul ly)" .?
Semantic similarities between words are currentlycalculated only by using BOIl which do not con-tain technical terms.
If tile sinfilarity points be-tween technical terms can be given by thesaurus,tile accuracy of tile analysis will be improved.Example(ii) will be analyzed rightly if greaterpoints are given to tile similarity between " T P"T 4 7".
-k 4.-- b ~f~'~ ( Actlve Chart Parsing)"and " l lPSG( Head-drtve, Phrase Structure Gram-i l ly the additional usage of relatively simple syn-tactic conditions, some sentences which are an-alyzed wrongly by this method will be analyzedrightly.
For example, because Japanese modi-fier/modifyee relations, inchnling the relation be-tween a verb and its case frame elements, donot erc~s each other, the modifier/modifyee r -lations in nmm phrases and predicative clauses donot spread beyond each phrase or clause, exceptthe relation concerning the last bunsetsu of them.This condition is not satisfied by the analyzed CSin the example(ill) whose prior noun phrase con-tains no verb related with the case frame element "~,~"  (grammar)".
By this condition it can be~-~-timated that only " 17~1/~\ [0  (natural langlage)MI~ ~ (analysis and)" or  "~ i :~:  (analysis and)"AODdS Dr COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hOt~T 1992 17 $ PROC.

We are plan-ning to do such a correction in the next stage ofthe syntactic analysis, which analyzes all modi-fier/modifyee relations in a sentence using the CSscopes detected by this method.?
in example(iv), the KB in the beginning part ofa sentence corresponds to the last CB.
That  is, ashort part of a sentence corresponds to the follow-ing long part.
It is very difficult to analyze suchan extremely unbalanced CS because this methodgives a priority to similar CSs.
In order to ana-lyze example(iv) the causal relationship between"~1~-9"C (usiug)" and "~tr~'J~z~ (create)" will benecessary.?
Some sentences analyzed incorrectly are too sub-tle even for a human to find the right CSs.
Exam-pie(v) cannot be analyzed rightly without expertknowledge.?
This method cannot handle the CSs in which theprior part contains ome modifiers and the poste-rior part contains nothing corresponding to them(example(vi), Figure 9).
For these structures wemust think the path extending upward in a partialmatrix, but it is impossible by the criteria aboutword similarities alone.The CSs such as example(v) and example(vi) can-not be analyzed correctly without semantic informs-tion.
fIowever such expressions are very few in actualtext.5 Concluding RemarksWe have shown that varieties of parallel structuresin Japanese sentences can be detected by the methodexplained in this paper.
As the result, a long sentencecan be reduced into a short one, and the success rateof syntactic analysis of these long sentences will bc-come very high.There are still some conjunctive xpressions whichcannot be recognized by the proposed method, andwe are tempted to rely on semantic information to getproper analyses for these remaining cases.
Semanticinformation, however, is not so reliable as syntacticinformation, and we have to make further efforts tofind out syntactic rather than semantic relations inthese difficult cases.
We think that it is possible.
Onething which is certain is that we have to see manymore components simultaneously in a wider range ofword strings of a loug sentence.References\[1\] M. Nagao, J. Tsujii, N. Tanaka, M. lshikawa(1983) Conjunctive Phrases in Scientificand Technical Papers and Their Analysis (inJapanese).
