The synthesis com-ponent of current ASL animation generation and scripting systems have limited handling of the many ASL verb signs whose movement path is inflected to indicate 3D locations in the signing space associated with discourse refer-ents.
Using motion-capture data recorded from human signers, we model how the mo-tion-paths of verb signs vary based on the lo-cation of their subject and object.
This model yields a lexicon for ASL verb signs that is pa-rameterized on the 3D locations of the verb?s arguments; such a lexicon enables more real-istic and understandable ASL animations.
A new model presented in this paper, based on identifying the principal movement vector of the hands, shows improvement in modeling ASL verb signs, including when trained on movement data from a different human signer.
1 Introduction American Sign Language (ASL) is a primary means of communication for over 500,000 people in the U.S. (Mitchell et al, 2006).
As a natural language that is not merely an encoding of English, ASL has a distinct syntax, word order, and lexicon.
Someone can be fluent in ASL yet have significant difficulty reading English; in fact, due to various educational factors, the majority of deaf high school graduates (age 18+) in the U.S. have a fourth-grade (age 10) English reading level or low-er (Traxler, 2000).
This leads to accessibility chal-lenges for deaf adults when faced with English text on computers, video captions, or other sources.Technologies for automatically generating com-puter animations of ASL can make information and services accessible to deaf people with lower English literacy.
While videos of sign language are feasible to produce in some contexts, animated avatars are more advantageous than video when the information content is often modified, the con-tent is generated or translated automatically, or signers scripting a message in ASL wish to pre-serve anonymity.
This paper focuses on ASL and producing accessible sign language animations for people who are deaf in the U.S., but many of the linguistic issues, literacy rates, and animation tech-nologies discussed within are also applicable to other sign languages used internationally.
2 Use Of Space, Inflected Verbs ASL signers can associate entities or concepts they are discussing with arbitrary locations in space (Liddle, 2003; Lillo-Martin, 1991; McBurney, 2002; Meier, 1990).
After an entity is first men-tioned, a signer may point to a 3D location in space around his/her body; to refer to this entity again, the signer (or his/her conversational partner) can point to this location.
Many linguists have studied this pronominal use of space (Klima et al 1979; Liddell, 2003; McBurney, 2002; Meier, 1990).
Some argue that signers tend to pick 3D locations on a semi-circular arc floating at chest height in front of their torso (McBurney, 2002; Meier, 1990); others argue that signers pick 3D locations at dif-ferent heights and distances from their body (Lid-dell, 2003).
Regardless, there are an infinite number of locations where entities may be associ-ated for pronominal reference; as discussed below, this also means that there are a potentially infinite number of ways for some verbs to be performed: a finite fixed lexicon for ASL is not sufficient.66While ASL verbs have a standard citation form, many can be inflected to indicate the 3D location in space at which their subject and/or object have been associated (Liddell, 2003; Neidle et al, 2000; Padden, 1988).
Linguists refer to such verbs as ?inflecting?
(Padden, 1988), ?indicating?
(Liddell, 2003), or ?agreeing?
verbs (Cormier, 2002).
We use the term ?inflecting verbs?
in this paper.
When they appear in a sentence, their standard motion path may be modified such that the movement or orientation goes from the 3D location of their sub-ject and toward the 3D location of their object (or more complex effects).
The resulting performance is a synthesis of the verb?s standard lexical motion path and the 3D locations associated with the sub-ject and object.
Because the verb sign indicates its subject and/or object, the names of the subject and object may not be otherwise expressed in the sen-tence.
If the signer chooses to mention them in the sentence, it is legal to use the citation-form (unin-flected) version of the verb, but the resulting sen-tences tend to appear less fluent.
In prior studies, we have found that native ASL signers who view ASL animations report that those that include spa-tially inflected verbs and entities associated with locations in space are easier to understand (than those which lack spatial pronominal reference and lack verb inflection) (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2012).
Fig.
1 shows the ASL verb EMAIL, which in-flects for its subject and object locations.
Some ASL verbs do not inflect or inflect for their ob-ject?s location only (Liddell, 2003; Padden, 1988).
There are other categories of ASL verbs (e.g., ?de-picting,?
?locative,?
or ?classifier?)
whose move-ments convey complex spatial information and other forms of verb inflection (e.g., for temporal aspect); these are not the focus of this paper.Fig.
1.
Two inflected versions of the ASL verb EMAIL: (top) subject associated with location on left and object on right, (bottom) subject on right and object on left.3 Related Work on Sign Animation Given how the association of entities with loca-tions in space affects how signs are performed, it is not possible to pre-store all possible combinations of all the signs the system may need.
For pointing signs, inflecting verbs, and other space-affected signs, successful ASL systems must synthesize a specific instance of the sign as needed.
Few sign language animation researchers have studied spa-tial inflection of verbs.
There are two major types of ASL animation research: scripting software (El-liott et al, 2008; Traxler, 2000) or generation software (e.g., Fotinea et al, 2008; Huenerfauth, 2006; Marshall and Safar, 2005; VCom3D, 2012) as surveyed previously by (Huenerfauth and Han-son, 2009).
Unfortunately, current generation and scripting systems for sign language animations typically do not make extensive use of spatial loca-tions to represent entities under discussion, the output of these systems looks much like the anima-tions without space use and without verb inflection that we evaluated in (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2012).
For instance, Sign Smith Studio (VCom3D, 2012), a commercially available scripting system for ASL, contains a single uninflected version of most ASL verbs in its dictionary.
To produce an inflected form of a verb, a user must use an ac-companying piece of software to precisely pose a character?s hands to produce a verb sign; this sig-nificantly slows down the process of scripting an ASL animation.
One British Sign Language anima-tion generator (Marshall and Safar, 2005) can as-sociate entities under discussion with a finite number of locations in space (approximately 6).
Its repertoire also includes a few verbs whose sub-ject/object are positioned at these locations.
How-ever, most of the verbs handled by their system involved relatively simple motion paths for the hands from subject to object locations, and the sys-tem did not allow for the arrangement of pronomi-nal reference points at arbitrary locations in space.
Toro (Toro, 2004; 2005) focused on ASL in-flected verbs; they analyzed the videos of human signers to note the 2D hand locations in the image for different verbs.
Next, they wrote animation code for planning motion paths for the hands based on their observations.
A limitation of this work is that asking humans to look for hand locations in a video and write down angles and coordinates is67inexact; further, a human looked for patterns in the data ?
machine learning approaches were not used.
There are some sign language animation re-searchers who have used modeling techniques ap-plied to human motion data.
Researchers studying coarticulation for French Sign Language (LSF) animations (Segouat & Braffort, 2009) digitally analyzed the movements of human signers in video and trained mathematical models of the move-ments between signs, which could be used during animation synthesis.
Because collecting data from human via video requires researchers to estimate movements from a 2D image, it is more accurate and efficient to use motion-capture sensors.
Du-arte et al collected data via motion capture in their SignCom project for LSF (Duarte and Gibet, 2011), and they reassembled elements of the recordings to synthesize novel animations.
4 Our Prior Modeling Research The goal of our research is to construct computa-tional models of ASL verbs that can automate the work of human users of scripting software or be used within generation.
Given the name of the verb, the location in space associated with verb?s subject, and the location associated with the object, our software should access its parameterized lexi-con of ASL verb signs to synthesize the specific inflected form needed for a sentence.
Our tech-nique for building these parameterized lexicon en-tries for each verb is data-driven: based on samples of sign language motion from human signers.
Spe-cifically, we record a list of examples of each verb for a variety of arrangements of the verb?s subject and object around the signer?s body.
Fig.
2. shows how we identified 7 locations on an arc around the signer; we then collected examples of each verb for all possible combinations of these seven locations for subject and object.
Table 1 lists the ASL verbs modeled in our prior work (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2010; Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).Fig.
2.

(subject) to the ?person being asked?
(object).
During the movement, the finger bends into a hooked shape.
(ASL ?1?

GIVE Subject & Object In this two-handed version of the sign, the signer moves two hands as a pair from the ?giver?
(subject) toward the ?recipient?
(object).
(Both hands have an ASL ?flat-O?
handshape.)
MEET Subject & Object Signer moves two index fingers towards each other (pointing upward) to ?meet?
at some point in the middle.
(ASL ?1?

SCOLD Object Only The signer ?wags?
(bounces up and down while pointing) an extended index finger at the ?person being scolded?
(object).
(ASL ?1?

TELL Object Only The signer moves an extended index finger from the mouth/chin toward the ?person being told?
(object).
(ASL ?1?

For verbs inflected for both subject and object location (MEET, GIVE), our training data con-tained 42 examples for all non-reflexive combina-tions of the 7 arc positions.
For verbs inflected for object location only (TELL, SCOLD, ASK), 7 ex-amples were collected.
While we focused on these five verbs as examples, we intend for our lexicon building methodology to be generalizable to other verbs and other sign languages.
In our early work (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2010), we collected samples of inflected verbs by asking a native ASL signer with animation experience to produce these verbs using the Gesture Builder sign creation software (VCom3D, 2012).
In later work, we collected more natural/accurate data by using motion-capture equipment to record a human signer per-forming a verb for various arrangements of sub-ject/object in space (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).
Regardless of the data source, we extracted the hand position for each keyframe for each verb.
(A keyframe is an important moment for a movement; a straight-line path can be represented merely by its beginning and end.)
Thus, for a two-handed verb (e.g., GIVE) that is inflected for both subject and object, we collected 504 location values: 42 examples x 2 keyframes x 2 hands x 3 (x, y, z) val-ues.
Next, we fit third-order polynomial models for each dimension (x, y, z) of the hand position at each keyframe ?
parameterized on the arc locations of the verb?s subject and object for that instance in the training data (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2010).
At this point, we could use the model to synthe-size novel ASL verb sign instances (properly in-flected for different locations of subject and object,68including combinations not present in the training data) by predicting the location of the hand for each of the keyframes of a verb, given the location of the verb?s subject and object on the arc.
Our animation software is keyframe based, and it uses inverse kinematics and motion interpolation to syn-thesize a full animation from a list of hand location targets for specific keyframe times during the ani-mation.
Additional details appear in (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2010; Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).
To evaluate our models in prior work, we con-ducted a variety of user-based and distance-metric-based evaluations.
For instance, we showed native ASL signer participants animations of short ASL stories that contained verbs (some versions pro-duced by our model, and some produced by a hu-man animator) to measure whether the stories containing our modeled verbs were easily under-stood, as measured on comprehension questions or side-by-side subjective evaluations (Huenerfauth and Lu, 2010).
No significant differences in com-prehension or evaluation scores were observed in these prior studies, indicating that the ASL anima-tions synthesized from our model had similar qual-ity to verb signs produced by a human animator.
5 Collecting More Verb Examples In prior work, we used motion-capture data from only a single human signer performing many in-flected forms of five ASL verbs.
For this paper, we asked two additional signers to perform exam-ples of each inflected form of the five verbs.
This section summarizes the collection methodology, described in detail in (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).
During a videotaped 90-minute recording session, each native ASL signer wore a set of motion-capture sensors while performing a set of ASL verb signs, for various given arrangements of the subject and object in the signing space.
We use an Intersense IS-900 motion capture system with an overhead ultrasonic speaker array and hand, head, and torso mounted sensors with directional micro-phones and gyroscope to record location (x, y, z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) data for the hands, torso, and head of the signer during the study.
We placed colored targets around the perim-eter of the laboratory at precise angles, relative to where the signer was seated, corresponding to the points on the arc in Fig.
2.
Fig.
4. shows how we set up the laboratory during the data collectionwith 10cm colored paper squares were attached to the walls; the two squares visible in Fig.
4 corre-spond to arc positions 0.9 and 0.6 in Fig.
2.
These squares served as ?targets?
for the signer to use as ?subject?
and ?object?
when performing various inflected verb forms.Fig.
4.
This three-quarter view illustrates the layout of the laboratory during the motion capture data collection; the signer is facing a camera (off-screen to the right).
Sitting behind the camera is another signer conversing with him.
Another native ASL signer sitting behind the video camera prompted the performer to produce each inflected verb form by pointing to the colored squares for the subject and the object for each of the 42 samples we wanted to record for each verb.
At the beginning of the session, the signer was asked to make several large arm movements and hand claps (Fig.
5) to facilitate the later synchroni-zation of the motion capture stream with the video data and scaling the data from the recorded human to match the body size of the VCom3D avatar.Fig.
5.
Arm movements the signer was asked to perform to facilitate calibration of the collected motion capture data.Fig.
6.
The signer signed the number that corresponded to each verb example being performed (left) and a close-up view of the hand-mounted sensor used in the study (right).69Occasionally during the recording session (and whenever the signer made a mistake and needed to repeat a sign), the signer was asked to sign the se-quence number of the verb example being recorded (Fig.
6); this facilitated later analysis of the video.
We needed to identify timecodes in the motion capture data stream that correspond to the begin-ning and ending keyframes of each verb recorded.
We asked a native ASL signer to view the video after the recording session to identify the time in-dex (video frame number) that corresponded to the start and end movement of each verb sign that we recorded.
(If we had modeled signs with more complex motion paths, we might have needed more than two keyframes.)
These time codes were used to extract hand location (x, y, z) data from the motion capture stream for each hand for each keyframe for each verb example that was recorded.
6 Modeling the Verb Path as a Vector Although experimental evaluations of verb models produced in prior work based on motion-capture data from a single human signer were positive (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011), this may not have been a realistic test.
When constructing a large-scale sign language animation system, it may not be possible to gather all of the needed training examples for all of the verbs for a large lexicon from a single signer.
For instance, if you wish to learn performances of a verb from examples of the inflected form of that verb that happen to appear in a corpus, then you would likely need to mix data recorded from mul-tiple signers to produce your training data set for learning the inflected verb animation model.
The challenge of using data from multiple sign-ers is that an ASL verb performance consists of: (1) non-meaningful/idiosyncratic variation in how dif-ferent people perform a verb (or how one person performs a verb on different occasions) and (2) meaningful/essential aspects of how a verb should be performed (that should be rather invariant across different signers or different occasions).
We prefer a model that captures the essential na-ture of the verb but not the signer-specific elements; models attuned too much to the specifics of a sin-gle human?s performance may overfit to that one individual?s version of the verb (or that one occa-sion when the signer performed).
Further, while motion-capture data recorded from humans with different body proportions can be somewhat re-scaled to fit the animated character?s body size to be used by the sign language animation system, no ?retargeting?
algorithm is perfect.
If signer-specific idiosyncrasies are captured in the verb animation model, then the variation in data sources used when building a large-scale sign language anima-tion project may be apparent in its output.
Our prior modeling technique explicitly learned the starting and ending location of the hands for each instance of a verb based on a human signer?s movements.
However, when different signers per-form a verb (e.g., GIVE with subject at arc position -0.6 and object at 0.3), they may not select exactly the same point in 3D space for their hands to start and stop.
What is common across all of the varia-tions in the performance is the overall direction that the hands move through the signing space.
We can find empirical evidence for this intuition if we compare motion-capture data of the three dif-ferent signers we recorded (section 5) performing the same ASL inflecting verbs.
When we calculate Euclidean distance between different signer?s start-ing location and their ending locations of the hands for identical verb examples, we see inter-signer variability (Fig.
7).
If we instead calculate the Eu-clidean distance between the vector (direction and magnitude) of the hand movement from the start to the ending location between signers, we see much smaller inter-signer variability (Fig.
7).
Section 7 explains the scale and formula used for the dis-tance metrics in Fig.
7 and elsewhere in this paper.Fig.
7.
Inter-signer variability in ASL verb signs, re-ported using a ?point?
or ?vector?
distance metric.70Using these results as intuition, we present a new model of ASL inflecting verbs in this paper, based on this ?vector?
approach to modeling the movement of the signer?s hands through space.
We assume that what is essential to a human?s per-formance of an inflected ASL verb is the direction that the hands travel through space, not the specific starting and ending locations in space.
Thus, we model each verb example as a tuple of values: the difference between the x-, the y-, and the z-axis values for the starting and ending location of the hand.
(The model has three parameters for a one-handed sign and six parameters for a two-handed sign.)
Using this model, we followed a similar polynomial fitting technique summarized in sec-tion 4 ?
except that we are now modeling a smaller number of parameters ?
our new ?vector?
model uses only three values per hand (deltax, deltay, deltaz), instead of six per hand in our prior ?point?
model, which represented start and end location of the hand as (xstart, ystart, zstart, xend, yend, zend).
This new model can then be used to synthesize animations of ASL verb signs for given subject and object arc positions around the signer ?
the differ-ence from our prior work is that these new models only represent the movement vector for the hands, not their specific starting and ending locations.
The purpose of building a model of a verb is that we wish to use it as a parameterized lexical entry in a sign language animation synthesis sys-tem; thus, we must explain how the model can be used to synthesize a novel verb example, given its input parameters (the arc position of the subject and the object of the verb).
While our new vector model predicts the motion vector for the hands, this is not enough; we need starting and ending locations for the hands (an infinite number of which are possible for a given vector).
Thus, we need a way to select a starting location for the hands for a specific verb instance (and then based on the vector, we would know the ending location).
We observe that, for a given verb, there are some locations in the signing space that are likely for the signer?s hands to occupy and some regions that are less likely.
Some motion paths through the signing space travel through high-likelihood ?pop-ular?
regions of the signing space, and some, through less likely regions.
Thus, we can build a Gaussian mixture model of the likelihood that a hand might occupy a specific location in the sign-ing space during a particular ASL verb.
For a giv-en motion vector, one possible starting point in the signing space will lead to a path that travels through a maximally likely region of the signing space.
Thus, we can search possible starting points for the hands for a given vector and identify an optimal path for the hands given a Gaussian mix-ture model of hand location likelihood.
Fig.
8 shows a (two-dimensional) illustration of our approach for selecting a starting location for the hand when synthesizing a verb.
The concentric groups of ovals in the image represent the compo-nent Gaussians in the mixture model, which was fit on the data from the locations that one hand occu-pied during a signer?s performances of a verb.
Given the vector (direction and magnitude) for the hand?s motion path for a verb (predicted by our model), we can systematically search the signing space for all possible starting locations for the hand ?
to identify the starting location that yields a path through the signing space with maximum probabil-ity (as predicted by the Gaussian model).
The ar-rows shown in Fig.
8 represent a few possible paths for the hand given several possible starting locations, and one of these arrows travels a path through the model with maximum probability.Fig.
8.
This 2D diagram illustrates how the starting lo-cation for the hand can be selected that yields a path through the mixture model with maximum probability.
Specifically, for each signer, for each hand, for each verb, we used the recorded motion-capture data stream between the start-times and end-times of all of the verb examples as training data, and then we fit a 3D Gaussian mixture model for each, to represent the probability that the hand would occupy each location in the signing space during that verb.
We used a model with 6 component Gaussians for modeling the signing space for each of the verbs SCOLD, GIVE, ASK, and MEET.
Due to the fast movement (and thus short clips of recorded motion-capture data) for the verb TELL, we only had sufficient data to fit a 5-component71Gaussian model for the locations of the hand dur-ing this verb (TELL is a one-handed verb).
When we need to synthesize a verb, then we use our vec-tor model to predict a movement vector for the hands, and then we perform a grid search through the signing space (in the x, y, and z dimensions) to identify an optimal starting location for the hand.
If run-time efficiency is a concern, optimization or estimation methods could be applied to this search.
In summary, the vector direction and magnitude of the hands are based on a model that is parame-terized on: the verb, the location of the subject on an arc around the signer, and the location of the object on this arc.
When a specific instance of a verb must be synthesized, a starting point for the hand is selected that maximizes the probability of the entire trajectory of the hands through space, based on a Gaussian mixture model specific to that verb (but not parameterized on any specific sub-ject/object locations in space).
All instances of the verb in the training data were used to train the mix-ture model, due to data sparseness considerations.
7 Distance Metric Evaluation  Because the premise of this paper is that models of ASL verbs based on a motion vector representation would do a better job of capturing the essential aspects of a verb?s motion path across signers, we conducted an inter-signer cross-validation of our new model.
We built separate models on the data from each of our three signers, and then we com-pared the resulting model?s predictions for all 42 verb instances collected from the other two signers.
For comparison purposes, we also trained three models (one per signer) using the ?point?-based model from our prior work (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).
Fig.
9 presents the results; the values of each bar are the average ?error?
for each synthe-sized verb example for all five ASL verbs in Table 1.
The error score for a verb example is the aver-age of four values: (1) Euclidean distance between the start location of the right hand as predicted by the model and the start location of the right hand of the human signer data being used for evaluation, (2) same for the end location for the right hand, (3) same for the start location for the left hand, and (4) same for end location for the left hand.
Fig.
9 shows that the new ?vector?
model has lower error scores than our older ?point?
model presented in prior work.
To interpret the Euclideandistance value, it is useful to know that the scale of the coordinate space used for the verb model is set such that shoulder width of a signer would be 1.0.
As a baseline for comparison, the average inter-signer variation (based on the values shown in Fig.
7) is also plotted in Fig.
9.Fig.
9.
Evaluation of the ?Point?
and ?Vector?
models for all five ASL verbs listed in Table 1.
Next, we wanted to compare the two models under two assumptions: (1) it may not be possible to gather a large number of examples of a verb from a single signer and (2) it may be necessary to mix data from multiple signers when assembling a training data set for a verb model.
For instance, these conditions would hold if a researcher were using examples of a verb performance extracted from a multi-signer corpus to assemble a training set.
Due to the limited size of most sign language corpora (and the many possible combinations of subject and object position in the signing space), a training set gathered in this manner would likely contain a relatively small number of training ex-amples ?
possibly gathered from multiple signers.
To test the models under these conditions, we assembled three training data sets ?
using the data from our three recorded signers.
Each data set in-cluded 22 examples of the performance of an ASL inflected verb for a subset of the various possible combinations of subject and object locations in the signing space ?
with half of the examples from one signer and half from another.
After training a model on each data set, then the model was evalu-ated against the 42 examples of each verb perfor-mance recorded from the third signer (who was not part of the training data used for that model).
This process was repeated for a total of three times (for all combinations of the data from the three sign-72ers).
For comparison purposes, we also trained three models (one based on each of the three two-signer data sets) using the ?point?-based model from our prior work (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2011).
Fig.
10 shows the results for two of the verbs in Table 1 (ASK and GIVE); the ?vector?
model has lower error scores than our older ?point?
model.Fig.

Evaluation of the ?Point?
and ?Vector?
models trained on a small ?mixed?
data set from two signers.
Examples of animations of the ASL verbs syn-thesized using each of these models are on our lab website: http://latlab.cs.qc.cuny.edu/slpat2012/ 8 Conclusion And Future Work This paper presented and evaluated a new method of constructing a lexicon of ASL verb signs whose motion path depends on the location in the signing space associated with the verb?s subject and object.
We used motion capture data from multiple signers to evaluate whether our new models do a better job of capturing the signer-invariant and occasion-invariant aspect of an ASL inflected verb?s move-ment, compared to our prior modeling approach.
The parameterized models of ASL verb move-ments produced in this paper could be used to syn-thesize a desired verb instance for a potentially infinite number of arrangements of the subject and object of the verb in the signing space ?
based on the collection of a finite number of examples of a verb performance from a human signer.Using this technique, generation software could include flexible lexicons that can be used to syn-thesize an infinite variety of inflecting verb in-stances, and scripting software could more easily enable users to include inflecting verbs in a sen-tence (without requiring the user to create a custom animations of a body movement for a particular inflected verb sign).
While this paper demonstrates our method on five ASL verbs, this technique should be applicable to more ASL verbs, more ASL signs parameterized on spatial locations, and signs in other sign languages used internationally.
In this paper, we studied a set of ASL verbs with relatively simple motion-paths (consisting of straight line movements, which therefore only re-quired two keyframes per verb); in future work, we may analyze verbs with more complex movements of the hands.
Further, our vector models represent the magnitude (length) of the hands?
motion path through space; in future work, we may explore techniques for rescaling these vector lengths.
In future work, we will also use hand orientation data from our motion capture sessions to synthesize hand orientation for sign animations.
We also plan to experiment with modeling how the timing of keyframes varies with subject/object positions.
Finally, we also plan on conducting a user-based evaluation study using animations synthe-sized by the models presented in this paper ?
to determine if native ASL signers who view anima-tions containing such verbs find them to be more grammatical, understandable, and natural.
