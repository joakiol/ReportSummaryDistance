and a two step proce-dure is applied.
In the first step, some lexical information such as proper names, technical terms, numbers and punctuation marks, loca-tion information and length information are used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy some conditions.
In the second step, texts are divided into several segments by using the anchor sentences as boundaries, and then the sentences in each segment are aligned by us-ing a length-based approach.
By applying this segmentation technique, the method avoids complex computation and error spreading.
Experimental results show that the precision of the method is 94.6% on the average for Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment for multi-domain texts.1 IntroductionParallel corpora are very useful for both theory-oriented linguistic research and application-oriented cross-language information processing.
For parallel corpora, the most important annota-tion is alignment, especially sentence alignment, which is a minimal and essential requirement for the annotation of a parallel corpus.
Aligning Chi-nese-Uyghur parallel texts at the sentence level, however, is already very difficult because of the considerable differences in the syntactic struc-tures and writing systems of the two languages.
A number of alignment techniques have been proposed for other language pairs, varying from statistical methods to lexical methods.
There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale andChurch, 1991), the lexical approach (Kay and R?scheisen, 1993), and the combination of the two (Chen, 1993 and Wu, 1994).
The first approach is based on modeling the relationship between the lengths of sentences that are mutual translations.
Similar algorithms based on this idea were developed independently by Brown, et al(1991) and Gale and Church (1993).
However, their main targets are rigid translations that are almost literal translations.
The method is applicable for structurally similar European lan-guages (i.e.
English-French or English-German).
One alternative alignment method is the lexi-con based approach that uses lexical information to obtain higher accuracy.
Kay and R?scheisen (1993) proposed a relaxation method to sentence alignment using the word correspondences ac-quired during the alignment process.
Chen (1993) developed a method based on optimizing word translation probabilities which he showed gave better accuracy than the sentence-length based approach.
Wu (1994) used a version of Gale and Church?s method adapted to Chinese along with lexical cues in the form of a small corpus-specific bilingual lexicon to improve alignment accuracy in text regions containing multiple sentences of similar length.
Melamed (1996) also developed a method based on word correspondences, for which he reported sentence-alignment accuracy slightly better than Gale and Church.
The method does not capture enough word correspondences for structurally different languages such as Chinese and Uyghur, mainly for the following two reasons.
One is the differ-ence in the character types of the two languages.
Chinese uses Chinese characters as its writing system while Uyghur uses alphabetic character.
The other is the grammatical difference of the two languages.
Chinese is an analytic language that has SVO word order.
In contrast, Uyghur is38a suffixing and agglutinative language that has SOV word order.
Thus, it is impossible in gen-eral to apply the simple-feature based methods to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.
This paper, on the basis of other sentence alignment methods, introduces an anchor sen-tence based sentence alignment method, in which some sentences are used as ?anchors?
and two steps are applied.
In the first step, some lexical information such as proper names, technical terms, numbers and punctuation marks, location information and length information are used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy some con-ditions.
In the second step, texts are divided into several segments by using anchor sentences as boundaries, and then the sentences in each seg-ment are aligned by using a length-based ap-proach.2 The Chinese-Uyghur Parallel CorpusUyghur is a Turkic language spoken by Uyghur people in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China and adjoining areas, which has about 9 million speakers.
As one of the official languages in Xinjiang, Uyghur is widely used in many fields such as education, communication, public-ation, etc.
Bilingualism in Xinjiang requires translation from Chinese to Uyghur or in the opposite direction.
Therefore, it is possible and essential to build a Chinese-Uyghur parallel corpus for teaching and research in translation, bilingual lexicography, linguistics, and other NLP applications.
Consequently, we began to build a Chinese-Uyghur parallel corpus for lin-guistic research, translation studies, teaching and applications such as machine translation.
The corpus is a sentence aligned general corpus of medium size.
So far, over 1 million characters of Chinese texts, in total 263 texts, and their corresponding Uyghur texts have been collected from several sources and included into the raw corpus after sampling.
The corpus texts cover a variety of styles, such as fiction, scientific texts, govern-ment documents, law texts, daily conversation and other texts.
Presently, the size of the corpus is smaller than we expected because it is not easy to obtain such digital text data which also needs to be processed before it can be included in the corpus.
The main sources of text data are pub-lished books, news papers, magazines and some web pages.
The proportions of the different gen-res in the corpus are shown in Figure 1.Other, 3%Scientifice,26%Conversation,7%Fiction, 26%Law, 24%Government,13%   Figure 1.
Genres and their percentages counted in tokens3 System OverviewThere is no previous work or approach specific to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.
So we firstly examined many papers related to the sub-ject to find an appropriae  method for Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.
Most approaches share many common properties in the methods they use and suggest only small modifications to the earlier approaches.
The length based method is suitable for aligning a very large bilingual cor-pus.
Since it does not use any lexical information for the alignment task, it can be used between any pair of languages.
However, in distant lan-guages where characters differ, it is not so effi-cient.
One alternative alignment method is the lexicon based approach that uses lexical informa-tion offering the potential for higher accuracy.
However, it is not easy to capture enough word correspondences or cognates for Chinese and Uyghur.
We may use bilingual dictionaries as an external resource to retrieve all possible word translations in such sentence alignment tasks.
However, this is time-consuming and rather complex because word segmentation and lemma-tization have to be done before the process of word matching can be started.
Secondly, we tried some tentative methods to Chinese-Uyghur sen-tence alignment.
According to the preliminary examination, it is generally not possible to apply the simple-feature based methods to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.
Finally, we decided to apply a mixed approach to obtain better and more efficient results by combining the three criteria: length, lexical in-formation and location information.
Below are the detailed descriptions of this approach.39Our algorithm combines techniques adapted from previous work on sentence and word align-ment.
Our method is similar to Wu?s (1994) in that it uses both sentence length and lexical in-formation.
But in our method, some lexical cor-respondences are used to find anchor sentences.
Our method is similar to Simard?s (1992) in that it uses cognates or anchors for sentence align-ment.
But in our method length information and anchors are used at different stages of sentence alignment.
Our method is similar to Melamed?s (1999) in that it uses a bitext mapping technique to locate anchor points, but it uses sentences as anchor points instead of words or characters.
A segmentation technique that splits the text into several sections is also introduced to improve the length-based approach.
As we can see from Fig-ure 2, a two-step approach is applied to Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment.paral l elt extGenerat i onCor rect i onRecogni t i onsegment at i onSent enceal i gnment  i n eachsect i onAl i gnmet nresul t Lastsect i on?TFKey Lexi conAnchor  sent enceext ract i onFigure 2: Flowchart of Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment  In the first step, some (1:1) sentence pairs, called anchor sentences, are extracted by using lexical information, location and length information.
A three-phase method is applied to anchor sentence extraction which will be explained in the follow-ing section.
In the second step, texts are divided into sev-eral segments by using these sentences as an-chors, and then all sentences in each segment are aligned by using a length-based approach.4 Anchor Sentence Extraction Algo-rithm4.1 Anchor SentenceBrown (1991) firstly introduced the concept of alignment anchors when he aligned the Hansard corpus.
In our method, we also introduced this concept, which in our case are anchor sentences.
In a parallel corpus, the anchor sentences are specific (1:1) sentence pairs that are strongly re-lated and that satisfy some conditions.
All suchsentence pairs which were extracted from bilin-gual texts during the first step are seen as anchor sentences.
These anchors divide the whole texts into short aligned segment.
The goal of anchor sentence extraction is to divide the source text and the target text into one-to-one smaller seg-ments.
And using this segmentation, we attempt to improve the sentence alignments produced by the length based alignment.
Sentence alignment tends to be better with shorter segments and, consequently, better sentence alignments are ob-tained.
For anchor sentence extraction, we applied a bitext mapping technique.
A bitext map is a set of pairs (x, y), where x and y refer to precise lo-cations in the first and second texts respectively, with the intention of denoting portions of the texts that correspond to one another (Simard, 1998).
However, we used a bitext map of sen-tence pairs instead of words or characters to point out the correspondences between these an-chor sentences (See Figure 3).01020304050607080901001100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Uyghur Sentence NumberChineseSentence Numbermain diagonalanchor pointsFigure 3.
Bitext map of sentence alignments  The horizontal axis denotes the sentence number in the Uyghur text, and the vertical axis denotes the sentence number in the Chinese text.
The anchor sentences, which are shown as anchor points in the bitext map, can be characterized by three properties: Injectivity: no two anchor points in a bitext map can have the same x or y coordinates.
Linearity: anchor points tend to line up straight.
In other words, all anchor points are to appear around a straight line.40Low variance of slope: The slope of the anchor points is rarely much different from the bitext slope.4.2 Algorithm DescriptionIn our anchor sentence extraction algorithm, a three-step process is applied to extract anchor sentences.
In other words, the search for each anchor sentence pairs alternates between the fol-lowing three steps: generation phase, correction phase and recognition phase.?
Generation phaseIn the generation phase, the algorithm generates candidate anchor sentence points within a search rectangle.
We define a search rectangle as fol-lows: Rectangle(x, y, x+3, y+3) in which x=last anchor point(x) and y=last anchor point(y).
The first search rectangle is anchored at the origin of the bitext map where x=0, y=0.
Subse-quent search rectangles are anchored at the pre-viously found points.
In this step, the search for an anchor sentence begins in a small search rectangle in the bitext map, whose diagonal is parallel to the main di-agonal.
If no candidate points are found, the search rectangle is proportionally expanded by the minimum possible amount, and the genera-tion cycle is repeated.
The rectangle keeps ex-panding until at least one acceptable point is found.
Three kinds of information such as sen-tence length, location information and lexical information are used to generate anchor points.
Sentence pairs that satisfy the following three conditions are added to the candidate anchor sen-tence array.
(1) Sentence length ratio As was shown in the sentence alignment litera-ture (Church, 1993), the sentence length ratio is also a very good indication of the alignment of a sentence pair.
In our method, for sentence pair P(c,u), if Len-Ratio(c,u)?
[MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], sen-tence pair P(c,u) would be candidate anchor sen-tences, in which LenRatio(c,u)= Lc/Lu (Lu is Uy-ghur sentence length, Lc is Chinese sentence length).
MinLenRatio and MaxLenRatio are calculated by using following formula:  MaxLenRatio=C?+A/( Lc+B) MinLenRatio= C?-A (Lc+B) C?=(C+ Len(C)/Len(U))/2  The constant C is the expected number of Chi-nese characters per Uyghur word.
C?
is theweighted value when taking text size into ac-count, the values of the constants are A=10?B=14.
(2) Matching score If the matching score of a sentence pair is above the threshold (we set the threshold = 1.1), it is considered a candidate anchor sentence.
By ap-plying this condition, we reject some sentence pairs with a matching score smaller than the threshold.
The matching score is calculated ac-cording to the matching degree of the key lexi-con and punctuations as described in section 4.3.
(3) Maximum Angle Deviation (MAD)  According to the properties of the anchor sen-tences, the slope of the anchor points should not be much different from the bitext slope.
So some sentence pairs are rejected by setting a maximum angle deviation.
The angle of each anchor point?s least-squares line is compared to the arc tangent of the bitext slope.
The anchor point is rejected if the difference exceeds the maximum angle de-viation threshold (MAD=3).
The angle between the least-squares line and the bitext slope is cal-culated according to the following formula:In this formula, A is the slope of the least-squares line, B is the bitext map slope.
This filtering process generates anchor sen-tences with higher accuracy; however, it causes errors in some cases.
So, we introduced another correction phase in order to reject some wrongly aligned sentence pairs.?
Correction phaseIn this step, some candidate sentences that are no anchor sentences are eliminated according to characteristics of anchor sentences, namely the length ratios of corresponding segments.
First, the algorithm checks if there are any conflicts between anchor points.
The injective property of anchor sentences implies that when-ever two anchor points overlap in the x or y axis, but are not identical in the region of overlap, then one of the points must be wrong.
To resolve such conflicts, we employed a lookup method to eliminate conflicting points.
Secondly, length ratios of corresponding seg-ments divided by candidate anchor sentences are calculated according to a similar formula as used for the sentence length ratio in order to reject wrongly aligned anchor points.
If the length ratio of the segments LenRa-tio(c,u)?
[MinLenRatio, MaxLenRatio], the41candidate anchor sentence must be an anchor sentence, otherwise it should be eliminated.
MinLenRatio and MaxLenRatio are calculated by using the following formulae: MaxLenRatio=C?+A/( Lc+B) MinLenRatio= C?-A (Lc+B)?
Recognition phaseA number of candidate anchor sentences can be obtained in a certain search region during appli-cation of the above two steps.
For anchor sen-tence alignment, accuracy is more important than recall rate.
So it is essential to introduce a recog-nition step in order to achieve higher accuracy by eliminating some unlikely anchor sentences.
In the recognition step, one best anchor sentence pair is selected from candidate anchor sentences according to two parameters: matching score and length similarity score.
The anchor selection al-gorithm gives a score to each proposed sentence pair during the recognition phase, and finds the alignment with the largest sum of scores.
A pa-rameter estimation method is described in the following section.4.3 Parameter EstimationMatching score: As previous work suggests, lexical information is critical for sentence align-ment, especially for finding anchor points.
It is well-known that some proper names and techni-cal terms have rigid translations in many lan-guages; numbers and punctuations appear in the same or similar forms in both source text and translation text.
In a parallel text, for instance, if a sentence contains a question mark, it is likely to be aligned to a sentence that also contains this mark, which can be a strong clue for sentence alignment.
This is also true for Chinese-Uyghur translations.
However, in our method, lexical and non-lexical clues are not used to align all sentences, but to estimate matching scores and to find the best anchor sentences.
We used multiple clues such as proper names, technical terms, punctua-tion marks and numbers.
In most cases, proper names, including person names, location names, organization names, and technical terms have unique translations that will be matched easily.
But, the problem is that per-son names and technical terms are often un-known words.
How to identify them is a difficult problem.
In our case, we first collected some popular proper names and the most frequent technical terms into a small lexicon that we callthe key lexicon.
More than 2000 words are in-cluded in the key lexicon at present.
Then, a very simple searching method is applied to match cor-responding words.
In addition, punctuation marks, including other symbols (e.g.
@#$%&), are the most obvi-ous clues in Chinese and Uyghur translation.
The correlation between Chinese and Uyghur punc-tuations is extremely high as depicted in Table1.

Table 1.
Corresponding punctuation marks in Chinese and Uyghur  For punctuation and numbers, no external re-sources but some rules are applied to estimate the matching degree of these clues.
The matching scores are calculated according to the average number of matched clues.
In other words, the more matched proper names, techni-cal terms, punctuation and numbers, the higher the matching score.
Length Similarity: Length similarity is a score that reflects the similarity between the length ratio of the current sentence pair and the ex-pected length ratio.
The following formula will be applied to calculate the length similarity of a proposed sentence pair (AiC, AiU): LenSimilar(AiC, AiU )=|Len(AiC)/Len(AiU)-C|/C Hereby C is expected number of Chinese charac-ter per Uyghur words.
We obtain C=2.01 ex-perimentally.
Len(AiC) and Len(AiU) are the sentence lengths of AiC, AiU, respectively.
However, the sentence length ratio is not sta-ble when a Chinese sentence is shorter than 10 characters.
So it is necessary to add a weighting factor WF:  LenSimilar(AiC, AiU )=|Len(AiC)/Len(AiU)-C|/C *WF if Len(AiC)<= StableLen, then  WF =a*Len(AiC)/StableLen, else WF =1.
Hereby StableLen=10, a=0.542The length similarity formula is also adjusted as follows: LenSimilar(AiC,AiU)=|Len(AiC)/Len(AiU)-C?|/C?
* WF Hereby C?
is the value weighted by the whole text size.5 Length Based Sentence AlignmentAccording to previous work by Gale and Church, length-based approaches are simple and can achieve good performance for different language pairs.
Because of this simplicity, many later re-searchers integrated this method to their sentence alignment methods.
We also applied the length-based approach to the second step of sentence alignment.5.1 Measuring Length in Words and Charac-tersDifferent length measuring methods can be used in the length-based approach.
Brown (1991) in-troduced the length-based algorithm based on the number of words in sentences, Gail and Church?s algorithm is similar to the Brown?s algorithm except that alignment is based on the number of characters in the sentences.
Uyghur is an alphabetic language while Chi-nese is a non-alphabetic language.
Therefore, it is a difficult problem to select the best length measuring model.
In general, a Chinese sentence does not have word boundary information; so one way to define Chinese sentence length is to count the number of characters in a sentence.
Another way is to count how many words are in a sentence after word segmentation.
For Uyghur sentences, we can similarly define the length in characters or in words.
In our case, we examined three possible length models described in the following Table 2:   L-1 Both Uyghur and Chinese sentences are measured in characters L-2 Both Uyghur and Chinese sentences are measured in words1 L-3 An Uyghur sentence is measured in words and a Chinese sentence is meas-ured in characters Table 2.
Three length models   The mean sentence length ratios, variances and correlation coefficients for each of the length models are calculated from hand aligned Chi-1 Bbibst software is used for Chinese word segmentation.nese-Uyghur texts of 988 sentence pairs.
Statis-tics of the three sentence length models are shown in Table 3.
L-1 L-2 L-3 Mean 3.99 1.07 2.01 Var 0.71 0.23  0.21 Correl 0.976 0.953 0.977 Table 3.
Statistics of different length measuring methods  In general, the smaller the variance, the better the sentence length model should be.
From Table 3, we can see that the character based length ratio model has significantly larger variance (0.71) than the other two models (L-2:0.23, L-3: 0.21).
This means L-1 is not as reliable as L-2 and L-3.
Both L-2 and L-3 have similar variance, but L-3 is better than L-2 with regard to the correlation coefficient, which indicates that sentence lengths have higher correlation if the lengths of Chinese and Uyghur texts are measured in characters and words, respectively.
A regression analysis of the three models also proved this result.
So we ap-plied the L-3 model to the length ratio examina-tion and length based sentence alignment.5.2 Preliminary Statistics for the Length-based MethodA length-based sentence alignment program is based on a very simple statistical model of sen-tence lengths.
The model makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other lan-guage, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
A probabilistic score is assigned to each pair of proposed sen-tence pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences and the variance of this ratio.
This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic pro-gramming framework in order to find the maxi-mum likelihood alignment of sentences.
The parameters C and S2 are used for likeli-hood estimation.
C is the expected number of Chinese characters per Uyghur words.
The pa-rameters C and S2 are determined empirically from a hand aligned parallel corpus of multi-domain texts.
According to our statistical results, we obtained C=2.01 and S2 =3.24.
Brown (1991) assume that every parallel cor-pus can be aligned in terms of a sequence of minimal alignment segments, which they call ?beads?, in which sentences align 1-to-1, 1-to-2, 2-to-1, 2-to-2, 1-to-0, or 0-to-1.
The alignment model is a generative probabilistic model for43predicting the lengths of the sentences compos-ing sequences of such beads.
The model assumes that each bead in the sequence is generated ac-cording to a fixed probability distribution over bead types.
We also calculated the probability of different alignment types.
Type Frequency Percentage?%?
1:1 807 81.3 1:0 or 0:1 5 0.5 1:2 or 2:1 152 15.3 2:2 7 0.7 1:3 or 3:1 20 2.0 other 2 0.2 Total 993 100 Table 4.
Proportion of alignment types  From the above statistical results, it is clear that the correlation between the length of a Chinese sentence in characters and the length of its Uy-ghur translation sentence in words is extremely high.
This high correlation suggests that length might be a strong clue for sentence alignment.
In our cases, we applied the length-based ap-proach suggested by Gale and Church after some parameters had been changed.6 Experimental ResultsIn this section, we report the results of experi-ments on aligning sentences by using two meth-ods.6.1 Test CorpusIn our experiment, we selected ten texts as our testing corpus.
The texts are varied in length and genres as summarized in Table 2.
T1, T2 and T3 are fiction texts; T4 is a law text; T5 and T6 are official documents; T7 and T8 are scientific texts, T9 and T10 are news and other articles.
The total size of the corpus is 72,000 tokens, about 1300 sentence pairs.6.2 ResultsFirstly, we aligned sentences by using two ap-proaches: a length-based algorithm, and an an-chor sentence based algorithm.
Then we manu-ally checked the alignment results for errors and calculated precision and recall scores.
Experi-mental results show that our anchor sentence based approach yields higher accuracy than the purely length based approach.
The precision of the method is 94.6% on the average for Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment on multi-domaintexts.
This is 2% higher than that of a purely length based approach.length-based anchor sentence based  Precision recall precision recall T1 89.9 89.3 94.2 93.6 T2 94.9 94.9 97.5 97.5 T3 83.1 84.5 86.4 87.9 T4 100 100 100 100 T5 100 100 100 100 T6 98.8 98.8 100 100 T7 98.5 98.9 98.5 98.9 T8 65 66.7 72.5 74.4 T9 89.1 86.0 96.4 93.0 T10 96.8 95.8 94.7 93.8 average 92.7 92.8 94.6 94.8 Table 5.
Experimental results  As we can see from Table 5, the error rates of the two methods vary from text to text.
We analyzed all errors during sentence alignment in order to find reasons and solutions.
The following is an error analysis.6.3 Error AnalysisFirstly, the style of a text affects the sentence alignment results.
In law texts and official docu-ments, precision is very high in comparison with the results in texts of other styles; even 100% accuracy has been achieved.
The reason for this may be the language style of source texts and translated texts.
The error rate is comparatively higher in fiction texts because of their free trans-lation style.
Secondly, complex sentence beads that in-clude deletion and insertion during translation affect the alignment accuracy.
According to Ta-ble 7, complex alignment types that the current alignment algorithm did not take into considera-tion account for 2.2% of the errors in Chinese-Uyghur translations.
So errors caused by these "unorthodox" translation patterns are unavoid-able.
There are many such errors in sample T8.
By examination, we found that the number of sentences in the Chinese text (122 sentences) and corresponding Uyghur text (179 sentences) is so unbalanced that many complex alignment types are involved.
This is a direct reason for the high error rate.
Finally, anchor sentences play an important role during alignment.
However, we found that it leads to more mistakes once wrong anchor sen-tence are selected.
For instance, in T9, just one wrong anchor sentence caused up to four errors44during second-step sentence alignment.
So it is crucial to align anchor sentences correctly.7 ConclusionsWe have developed a very effective sentence alignment method based on anchor sentences.
In our method, firstly anchor sentences are ex-tracted from bilingual texts according to key lexical information, location information and length information; secondly, whole texts are divided into small segments by using anchor sen-tence points; finally, sentences in each small segment are aligned by using a length-based ap-proach.
We have implemented the proposed method on the parallel Chinese-Uyghur corpus.
Experimental results show that the precision rate of the method is 2% higher than that of a purely length-base approach.
Differences and advan-tages of our anchor sentence based method are compared to other methods in Table 6.Methods Length based Lexical based Our method Advantages Length in-formation Yes No Yes Quick Lexical information No Yes Yes Higher ac-curacy Language resource No Dictionary Simple lexicon Simple Special character No No Yes Higher ac-curacyMulti level No No Yes Avoids er-ror spread-ingFor multi- domain Good Not good GoodApplicable to different  texts Table 6.
