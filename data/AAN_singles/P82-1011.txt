Problems ?ith Domain-Independent Natural Language Database Access SystemsSteven P. ShvartzCognitive Systems Inc.234 Church StreetNew Haven, Ca.
06510Zn the past decade, a number of natural lang-uage database access systems have been constructed(e.g.
Hendrix 1976; Waltz et e l .
1976; Sac-erdoti 1978; Harris 1979; Lehner~ and Shwartz1982; Shvartz 1982).
The level of performanceachieved by natural language database access sys-tems varies considerably, with the sore robustsystems operating v i thtn  a narrow domain ( i .e .
,content area) and re ly ing heavily on domain-speci-f i c  knowledge to guide the language understandingprocess.
Transporting a system constructed for onedomain into a new domain is extremely resource-in-tensive because a new set of domain-specific know-ledge must be encoded.In order to reduce the cost of transportat ion,a great deal of current research has focussed onbui ld ing natural language access systems that aredomain-independent.
More spec i f i ca l l y ,  these sys-tems attempt to use syntact ic knowledge in con-~unction with knowledge about the structure of thedatabase as a subst i tute for  conceptual knowledgeregarding the database content area.
In th is  paperI examine the issue of whether or not i t  is possi-ble to bui ld a natural language database accesssystee that achieves an acceptable level of per-formance without including domain-specific concep-tual knowledge.6 gerforn=nca ~i~g~ion for oa~u?al language atoms==X=~em=,The pr inc ip le  motivation for bui ld ing naturallanguage systems for database access is ~o free theuser from the need for data processing instruct ion.A natural language front end is a step above the"Engl ish- l ike = query systems that presently domi-nate the commercial database retr ieval  f i e ld .Engl ish- l ike query systems allow the user to phraserequests as English sentences, but permit only arestr ic ted subset of English and impose a r ig idsyntax on user requests.
These Engl ish- l ike querysystems are easy to learn, but a t ra in ing  period iss t i l l  required for the user to learn to phrase re-quests that conform to ~hc~ rest r ic t ions .
Howe-ver, the t ra in ing period is often very br ie f ,  andnatura~ language systems can be considered superioronly i f  no computer-related t ra in ing or knowledgeis required of the user.This c r i te r ion  can only be met i f  no rest r ic -t ions are placed on user queries.
A user who haspreviously re l ied on a programmer-technician tocode formal queries for information retr ievalshould be permitted to phrase inform%ion retr ievalrequests t~ the program in exactly the same way asto the technician.
That is, whatever the techni-cian would understand, the program shouldunderstand.
For example, a natural language f rontend to a stock market database should understandthat(1) Did IBM go up yesterday?refers to PRZCE and not VOLUME.
However, the sys-tem need not understand requests that a program-mer-technician would be unable to process, e.g.
(2) Is GENCO a l i ke ly  takeover target?That is, the programmer-technlcisn uorking for aninvestment firm would not be expected to know howt<) process requests that require "expert" knowledgeand neither should | natural language front end,If, however, = natural language system cannot a-chieve the level of performance of a program-ear-technician it will seem stupid because it doesnot meet = user's expectations for an English un-derstanding system,The mprograemer-technician criterion m cannotpossibly be met by = domain-independent naturallanguage access system because language understan-ding requires domain-specific world knowledge.
Ona theoret ical  level ,  the need for a knowledge basein a natural language processing system has beenwell-documented (e.g.
Schank A Abelson 1977;Lehnert 1978; Dyer 1982).
I t  w i l l  be arguedbelow that in an applied context, a system thatdoes not have a conceptual knowledge base can pro-duce at best only a shallow level of understandingand one that does not meet the c r i te r ion  specif ledabove.
Further, the domain-independent approachcreates a host of problems that are simply non-ex-istent in knowledge-based s~stems.E~oble== far dolai0:i0dg~a0dan~ =~=~?=~ in fer -ence.
ambiguity, sod aoagbora,In ferent ia l  processing is an integral part ofnatural language understanding.
Consider the fo l -lowing requests from PEARL (Lehnert and Shvartz1982; Shwartz 1982) when i t  operates in the domainof geological map generation:60(3) Show ss e l l  o i l  ve i l s  from 1970 to 1980.
(4) Show Is a l l  o i l  ve i l s  f ro !
8000 ~ 7000.
(5) Show se a l l  o i l  wel ls  1 t~a 2000.
(6) Show ee a l l  o i l  wel ls 40 to 41, 80 to 81.A programmer-technician In the petrochemical in-dustry would in fe r  that  (3) re fers  to dr i l l i ngdates, (4) re fers  ~o ve i l  depth, (5) re fers  ~o thesap scale, end (6) re fers  to la t i tude / long i tudespec i f i ca t ions .Correct processing of  these requsst~ requires in-fe rent ia l  processing that  is  based on knowledge ofthe petrochemical industry.
That is ,  these con-ventions =re not in everyone's general workingknowledge of  the English language.
Yet they arestandard usage for  people who communicate with eachother about dr i l l i ng  data, and any systss thatclaims t~o provide a natural language inter face t~ ldata base of  d r i l l i ng  data must have the knowledgeto cor rect ly  process requests such as these.Without such in fe rent ia l  processing, the user isrequired to spel l  out everything in deta i l ,  some-thing that  is s ispty  not necessary in normal Eng-l i sh  discourse.Another probles fo r  any natural language un-derstanding systes is the processing of  ambiguouswords.
In some cases disambiguation can be per-formed syntact i ca l ly .
In other cases, the s t ruc -ture of  the database can provide the informationnecessary fo r  word sense disambiguation (more onth i s  below).
However, in many cases disasbiguat ioncan only be performed i f  domain-specif ic,  worldknowledge is ava i lab le .
For example, consider theprocessing of  the word "sales = in (7),  (8) and (9).
(7) What is the average mark up for  sales of  stereoequipment?
(8) What is the average mark down for  sales ofstereo equipment?
(9) What is the average mark up during sales ofstereo equipment?
(10) What is the average mark down durlng sales ofstereo equipment?These four  requests, which are so ne l r ly  ident icalboth lex ica l ly  and syntact i ca l ly ,  have very d is -t inc t  meanings that  derive from the fac t  that  thecorrect  sense of  ' s l i es t  in (7) ls qui ts  d i f fe rentfrom the sense of  "sales = intended in (8),  (9),  end(10).
Nest people have l i t t le  d i f f i cu l ty  deter -mining which sense of  =sales = is intended in thesesentences, and neither would a knowledge-based un-derstander.
The key to the disambiguation processinvolves world knowledge regarding re ta i l  sales.Problems of  anaphora pose s imi la r  problems.For example, suppose the fo l lowing requests weresubmitted to a personnel data base:(11) L i s t  a l l  salesmen with ret irement plans alongwith the i r  sa la r ies .
(12) L i s t  a l l  o f f i ces  with women managers alongwith the i r  sa la r ies .While these requests are syntact i ca l ly  ident ica l ,the referents  fo r  " the i r "  in (11) end (12) occupyd i f fe rent  syntact ic  pos i t ions.
As human informa-t ion processors, ve have no t rouble understanding61that  sa lar ie~ are associated with people, soret irement p l lns  and o f f i ces  are never consideredas possible referents .
Again, domain-specif icworld knouledge i s  helpful  in understanding theserequests.~Ug~u~al  knQwlldgm i= m =uh=~i~u~m fo~ GQO?ID~ualknowlsdgg,One of  inner|aliens to eaerge  from the con-s t ruc t ion  of  domain-independent systems is t c levermechanism that  ext racts  dosa in-spec l f l c  knowledgef ree the s t ructure  of  the data  base.
For example,the reso lut ion of  the pronoun ' the i r  = in both (11)and (12) above could be accomplished by using onlys t ructura l  ( ra ther  than conceptual) knowledge ofthe domain.
For example, suppose the payro l ldatabase fo r  (11) were structured such that  SALARYand RETIRENENT-PLANS were f ie lds  within a SALESMANf i le .
I t  would then be possible to in fe r  thatl the i r= re fers  to =salesmen = in (11) by noting thatSALARY is a f ie ld  in the SALESMEN f i le ,  but thatSALARY is not an entry in I RETIREMENT-PLANS f i l e .Unfortunately,  th i s  approach has l i l i ted  u-t i l i ty  because i t  re l ies  on a fo r tu i tous  de,abases t ructure .
Consider what would happen i f  the database had a top- leve l  ERPLOYEES f i l e  ( rather  thanindividual  f i l es  fo r  each type of  employee) withf ie lds  fo r  JOB-TYPE, SALARY, COMMISSIONS, and RE-TZRENENT-PLANS, With th i s  database organizat ion,i t  would not he possible to deters ine that(13) L i s t  a l l  salesmen who have secrebaries alongwith the i r  comsissions.l the i r= re fers  ~o meal=amen" and not "secretar ies  =in (13) on the basis of the s t ructure  of  the data-bass.
To the naive user, however, the sein ing ofth i s  sentence is  per fect ly  c lear .
A person whocou ldn ' t  determine the re ferent  of  " the i r  = in (13)would not be perceived as having an adequate cos-sand of  the English language and the same would betrue fo r  a computer system that  did not understandthe request.~i~fall= a==g~il~Id wi~b ~bm dQ?zin:indag~ndln~ i~ -In a knowledge-based systes such as PEARL, =natural language request is parsed into a concep-tual representat ion of  the meaning of  the request.The re t r ieva l  rout ine is then generated f ree th i sconcepbual representat ion.
As a resu l t ,  the parseris independent of  the logical  s t ructure  of  thedatabase.
That is,  the same parser can be used fo rdatabases with d i f fe rent  logical  s t ructures ,  butthe same information content.
Further, the sameparser can be used whether the required informationis located in = s ingle f i l e  or in lu l t ip le  f i l es .In a domaln-independent systes, the parser isent i re ly  dependent on the s t ructure  of  the databasefor  domain-specif ic knowledge.
As a resu l t ,  onemust restructure the parser fo r  databases with i -dentical  content but d i f fe rent  logical  s t ructure .S i s i la r ly ,  the output of  the parser lus t  be veryd l f fe rent  vhen the required information Is con-tained in mulSiple f i l es  rather than a single f i l e .Because of the i r  lack of conceptual knowledgeregarding the database, domain-independent systemsrely heavily on key words or phrases to indicatewhich database f ie ld  iS being referred to.
Forexample,(14) Vhat is B i l l  Smith's ~ob &male?High& be easi ly processed by simply re t r iev ing  thecon&ants of a JOB-TITLE f ie ld .
Di f ferent vlys ofreferr ing ~o job t i t le  can also be handled as syn-onyms.
However, dosiin?independent systems getinto deep trouble vhen the database f ie ld  thatneeds to be accessed is not d i rec t ly  indicated bykey words or phrases in the input request.
Forexample,(15) Is  John Jones the chi ld of an alumnus?is easi ly  processed i f  there ex ists  aCHILD-OF-AN-ALUMNUS f ie ld ,  but the query(16) Is  one of John Jones' paren&s an alumnus?contains no key word or phrase to indicate that theCHILD-OF-AN-ALURNUS f ie ld  should be accessed, In aknowledge-based system, the retr ieval  routine isgenerated from a conceptual representation of themeaning of the user query and therefore key wordsor phrases arm not required.
A related problemoccurs with queries involving a~rept ion  or quan-t i ty .
For example,(17) How many employees are in the sales depart-ment?l ight  require ret r iev ing the value of a part icu larf ie ld  (e.g.
NUHBER-OF-EHPLOYEES), or i t  s ight  re-quire to ta l l ing  the number of records in the EH-PLOYEE f i l e  that have the correct DEPARTNENT f ie ldvalue, or, i f  the departments are broken down intoof f ices,  i t  l i ght  require to ta l l ing  the NUN-BER-OF-ENPLOYEES f ie ld  for each of f ice .
In m do-main-independent system, the correct parse dependsupon the structure of the database and is therefored i f f i cu l t  to handle in a general way.
In a know-ledge-based system such as PEARL, the d i f fe rentdatabase structures would simply require a l te r ingthe mapping between the conceptual representaSionof the parse and the retr ieval  query.F inal ly ,  th is  reliance on database structurecan lead to wrong answers.
A classic example isHarr is '  (1979) 'snowmobile problem =.
Yhen Harr is 'ROBOT system interfaces with a f i l e  containing in-formation about homeowner's insurance, the word'snowmobile" is defined as any number ?
0 in the'snowmobile f ie ld"  of an insurance pol icy record.This means that as far as ROBOT is concerned, thequestion 'How many snowmobiles are there?
= is nod i f fe rent  from "How many po l ic ies  have snowmobilecoverage?"
However, the correct answers to the twoquestions wi l l  often be very d i f ferent .
I f  thef i r s t  question is asked and the second question isanswered, the result  is an incorrect answer.
I fthe f i r s t  question cannot be answered due to thestructure of the database, the system should informthe user the5 th is  is the case.~oogluaioo=.I have argued above that conceptually-baseddomain-specific knowledge is absolutely essentialfor n | tu r l l  language database access systems.Systems that rely on dltabase structure for th i sdomain-specific knowledge v i i i  not achieve an ac-ceptable level of performance - -  i .e .
operate atthe level of understanding of a programmer-techni-cian.Because of the requirement for de l ian-spec i f icknowledge, conceptually-based systems are res t r i c -ted t~o l imited domains and are not readi ly portable~o new content areas.
However, e l iminat ing thedomain-speciflc conceptual knowledge is throwing&he baby out with the ba&h water.
The conceptual-ly-based domain-specific knowledge is the key torobust understanding.The approach of the PEARL project  with regardt~ the &ransportabi l i ty  problem is t~ try  and I-denti fy areas of discourse that are common t~ mostdomains and to bui ld robust modules for  naturallanguage analysis within these domains.
Examplesof such domains are temporal reference, loci&ionreference, and report generation.
These modulesare knowledge-based and can be used by a wide va-r iety  of domains to help extract  ~hm conceptualcontent of a requss5.REFERENCESDyer, N. (1982).
