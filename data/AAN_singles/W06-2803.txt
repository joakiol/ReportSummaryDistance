Linguistic features of Italian blogs: literary languageMirko TavosanisDipartimento di Studi italianisticiVia del Collegio Ricci 10I-56126 Pisa PI Italytavosanis@ital.unipi.itAbstractPreliminary  surveys  show  that  the  lan?guage  of  blogs  is  not  restricted  to  themore  informal  levels  of  expression.
In?stead blogs may include many kinds ofwritten  language:  from  simple  personalnotes to literary prose or poetry.
The pa?per presents a sample of Italian blogs andcomments on the results of the search ofliterary forms in two Web corpora usingsearch engine queries.1 IntroductionClose scrutiny of e-mails has revealed the pres?ence  of  many  different  kinds  of  style  in  thismedium  (Baron  2000:  250-2;  Pistolesi  2003:178-184 for Italian).
The same appears to be truefor  blogs.
It  is  therefore  difficult  to  determinespecific linguistic features of blogs.
Even occa?sional surveys however show that blogs are notlimited to ?a language reminiscent of brief notes,spoken asides, or short letters, rather than of es?says or newsprint?.
Such language plays an im?portant  role  in  blogs,  but  accounts  for  only  asmall part  of them.
Many individual blogs aiminstead at a true ?literary?
status and have a cor?respondingly  high  standard  for  word  selection.Therefore,  the  linguistic  equilibrium  of  thismedium could be higher than expected.
The pa?per will try to describe the general linguistic fea?tures of Italian blogs by contrasting them mainlywith the language of newspapers, giving appro?priate quantitative data.2 Preliminary qualitative analysis: a tex?tual sampleAs a reference sample of blogs we can take tenblogs hosted by the Italian blog publishing siteSplinder.com (arguably the most popular site ofits kind).
The sample was chosen by selecting themost recent blog appearing in the site list of the?Ultimi blog aggiornati?
(?Most recently updatedblogs?
),  and  by  selecting  the  first  page  of  thepostings published by the blog itself in Novem?ber  2005  (if  it  had  at  least  two  postings  inNovember).
The selection was made at differenttimes  on  one  given  day  (29  December  2005)Some features of the selected blogs are describedin Table 1.A post taken from one of the less formal blogsin the sample (di ritorno da...) shows many ofthe linguistic features commonly ascribed to thiskind of writing:giornata pi?

la vitaparallela  che  sto  facendo  a  milano  non  miappartiene..quindi non posso dire che sia mia..che di?scorso complesso per?

il  30  di  dicembre..aspettoquel giorno e intanto mi preparo per quattro esami al?l'universit?..ah...il viaggio al prezzo di 45 euro di volo e 90 diostello..ultra risparmio...The text  describes  the  planning  of  a  holdaytrip in Scotland for New Year's Eve and personalfeeliings.The  post  shows  also  many  unprofes?sional  graphic  choices  (no  capital  letters  forproper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence,no spacing after  punctuation marks,  perch?
in?stead of perch?)
and the frequent use of three (or,11wrongly, two) suspension points.
The latter fea?ture, also illustrated in Table 1, is considered oneof the most common features of blogs and in thiscase it is surely used to give a feeling of ?spokenlanguage?
to the text.The language of the other blogs in the sampleis, instead, very different.
Suspension points areused in the blog SoleLuna in order to create high-pitched literary texts.
This is a kind of lyrical de?scription of a problematic relationship:Cancelli i tuoi passi nell'ombra di te stesso e scom?pari e compari quando e come pi?
ti aggrada... Ed iomi lascio prendere dai pensieri e mi lascio intorpidiredai ricordi... Mi rivesto di te.. di noi.. Ho freddo.. Cer?co di scaldarmi con il  ricordo di un amore...
Non tiamo.
Amo il  ricordo di  quello che eravamo...  E misfuggono via dalla mente le sensazioni e scivolano viagli  odori..  si  sbiadiscono i sapori...  Tutto diventa lasfumatura del  proprio colore..  la  parodia,  la  beffa...Cerco  di  palpare  le  immagini  e  faccio  attenzione  anon sgualcirle.. pi?
di quanto non lo sia io...This kind of lyric language is  heavily basedupon  the  use  of  literary  forms  (?ti  aggrada?
),complex rhetorical  constructions,  ?-d  eufonica?and so on.Midway between these two extremes we canfind blogs like Incontrista.
The posts of this blogare written in a language echoing newspaper edi?torials  and  brilliant  prose.
Significantly,  theymake no use of suspension points, as in this sec?tione  (where  the  author  contrasts  the  averagepsychological differences between female blog?gers and female subscribers of dating sites):E' quindi un fatto ancora che le splinderine sonomediamente  delle  ragazze  migliori  delle  meeticheproprio per questo motivo.
Hanno capacit?, caratteri?stiche e aspetti che a me piacciono, come la voglia diesprimersi, di raccontare, di scrivere, di comunicare,di leggere, di scegliere, di assumere posizioni critiche.Le splinderine fanno parte della fascia pi?
esperta einnovativa degli utenti internet, quelli che ne fanno unutilizzo pi?
consapevole, e che hanno una cultura pi?elevata della  media.
Le splinderine sono donne chehanno qualcosa da dire e vogliono compagni di alto li?vello con cui cercano il confronto serrato e accettanoanche lo scontro.It seems that none of those kinds of languagecould today claim to be the main model for blogwriting.
Free expression, literary prose and news?paper  writing  seem to  co-exist  without  a  cleardominant  position.
Of  course,  however,  thoseimpressions can be given substance only throughextension of the field of search to a large set ofblogs.
This is partly made possible by the use ofmodern search engines.3 Quantitative  analysis  of  large  corporausing search enginesSome  linguistic  features  of  blogs  can  now  beprobed and measured using search engines.
Forinstance,  preliminary  searches  show  that  fromthe orthographical point of view Italian blogs aremuch more correct than the average of the Italianweb and that they are edited at least as well asonline newspapers (Tavosanis in print b).
Otherindicators  related  to  the  use  of  ?neo-standard?Italian forms (Berruto 1987) in the field of per?sonal  pronouns  and  demonstratives  suggest  akinship between blogs and newspapers (Tavosa?nis in print a).According to those searches, the main differ?ences between blog posts and newspaper articlesare not linked to writing accuracy or to differentmorphological choices.
We can therefore assumeas a working hypothesis that the main differencesbetween blogs and newspapers in fact relate tolexicon and syntax.The syntactic status of many blogs is probablywell represented by the textual samples chosenabove (widespread use of suspension points be?ing  the  most  conspicuous  feature).
However,close  survey  of  this  level  can  probably be  ob?tained only through the encoding of a wide cor?pus with syntactic tagging.The lexical  features  of  blogs  can  instead bestudied  through  simple  search  engine  analysis(see again Tavosanis in print a and b for detailsof this method).
Newspaper editing in Italy, en?forced by a strong tradition and dedicated staff,excludes words considered too expressive (apartfrom those acknowledged by the same tradition:Bonomi 2002).
Blogs, on the other hand, can in?clude forms taken from every level of linguisticuse.
We can therefore expect  that  both literaryand low forms are  more used in blogs than innewspapers.Two Web corpora were then selected: the website  of  the  newspaper  La  Repubblica,  indexedand queried through the Google interface (= R),and the whole of the blogs indexed in the betaversion  of  Blogsearch.google.com  (=  B).
Ofcourse, no exact data are available on the consis?tency of the two collections and the number oftokens indexed.
The two corpora seem howeverroughly equal in size:  the search of a commonword like questo gives 427,000 occurrences in R12and 467,000 in B; the search of  quello 209,000(R) and 257,608 occurrences (B); the search oflui 118,000  (R)  and  159,970  occurrences  (B);and so on.
Of course,  since word frequency isstrongly correlated with the style and topic of thetexts (for the Italian situation see Bortolini 1971:XIV-XV; Voghera 1993), this assessment cannotbe considered an exact estimate.
It does howevergive a preliminary quantitative estimate.The highest frequency of vulgar words in theB corpus is of course undisputed, since newspa?per editing is a strong barrier against this kind oflanguage, and it needs no particular demonstra?tion, e.g., we can find 30,310 occurrences of theword cazzo in B against 278 in R, and so on.It is more difficult to demonstrate the highestfrequency of literary language, which in the Ital?ian tradition has a wide and varied lexicon.
Theabundance of synonyms and dispersion of formslead  one  to  focus  searches  on  large  groups  of?weak?
words instead of a limited set of ?strong?words.Next the list of ?literary?
verbs beginning withthe letters b, e and v in the De Mauro (2000) dic?tionary  was  selected  for  analysis.
The  chosenverbs were 31 (b-), 47 (e-) and 49 (v-).
Many ofthem also had non-literary uses and/or coincidedwith  other  Italian  words:  therefore  only  thewords  without  homographs  were  used  for  thesearch, where every meaning recorded in the dic?tionary was marked at least as ?obsolete?
(codeOB),  ?literary?
(LE)  or  ?bureaucratic?
(BU).This left 23 (b-), 28 (e-) and 21 (v-) verbs.
Thetwo corpora were then searched for the infinitiveforms of the verbs.
Many of them did not appearat all: baiare, balbuzzire, ballonzare (1 occurren?ce in a text written in the dialect of Naples), ba?sciare,  benedicere  (2  occurrences  in  two  textswritten in the dialect of Naples), biancicare, bia?stemiare,  blasmare,  bombire,  botare,  botarsi,bravare,  buccinare,  bulicare,  ebere,  ecclissare,educere,  enfiare,  enfiarsi,  escomunicare,  escuo?tere,  escusare,  esinanire,  espedire,  esseguire,esterminare,  estollere,  estollersi,  estorre,  estrue?re, estruare, esturbare, esurire, evellere, evenire,vagheggiarsi,  vanare,  vengiare,  vengiarsi,  ver?berare,  verdicare,  verdire,  vernare,  verzicare,vilificare and vincire.The search also revealed that a verb marked inthe  dictionary  as  ?literary?
was  instead  widelyused in both corpora: vigilare.
While other formsoccurred at most 94 times, in the corpora thereare 644 occurrences of vigilare, evenly balanced(332 in B, 312 in R).
It therefore appears morecorrect  to  consider  this  verb  as  a  ?common?word,  without  literary connotations,  and to  ex?clude it from further analysis.In a second phase, many forms were excludedfrom counts since they resulted simple typos orbroken forms of different words (e.g., many oc?currences of  ventare  are in fact  occurrences ofwidely  used  verbs  like  diventare  or  inventare,with  incorrect  spacing).
Only words  where  thepossibilities  of  misspellings  seemed  low  weretherefore included In the counts.After this sifting, the forms represented in thecorpus occurred as described in Table 2:FormOccurrencesin BlogsOccurrences in La Repubblicabasire 1 0bastarsi 12 1beare 9 2biasmare 0 1biondeggiare 0 2biscazzare 1 0bruire 1 0bruttare 0 1bugiare 1 0elicere 0 1ergere 24 9esondare 6 4esperire 56 21esplicare 79 15estimare 2 0evoluire 2 0vacare 4 0vagolare 7 1vanire 1 0vaticinare 17 6ventare 2 0vigoreggiare 2 0villaneggiare 1 0volvere 2 0volversi 0 1Total 230 65Table 2: occurrences of literary formsIt seems therefore that some Italian blogs havein fact a higher proportion of a random selectionof literary words than Italian newspapers.
Furthersearches should be able to confirm or refute thisfinding.134 ConclusionPreliminary  analyses  of  Italian  blogs  seem  toconfute the simple equivalence ?blogs = informaltext?.
Clearly,  both statistical  tools and specialmonitoring software are needed to give this kindof  search  more  focus  and  more  depth.
Futuresearches must also achieve a better understand?ing of the coverage of search engines and shouldbe based upon different search engines.
It wouldbe useful, moreover, to identify and exploit othersearchable indicators of the linguistic quality of atext.
Anyway in future researches adequate spaceshould be allowed for the assessment of the pres?ence of literary features in many blogs.Reference[Baron 2000] Baron, N. Alphabet to Email.
