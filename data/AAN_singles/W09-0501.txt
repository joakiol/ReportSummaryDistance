Frederickou St., Palouriotisa, Nicosia 1036 Cypruspre.mc@fit.ac.cyAbstractThis article is concerned with Extreme CaseFormulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000;Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous CypriotGreek conversations.1 This study confirmsthe occurrence of ECFs in complaints asidentified by Edwards (2000) Pomerantz(1986), but goes one step further to analysethe sequential and interaction workaccomplished with ECFs in reporting?opposition-type stories?
(Schegloff, 1984)and in complaining about a non-presentparty?s misbehaviour.
Opposition-typestories report the oppositional conversationof the teller with a third non-present party(id.).
Interestingly, in the conversationalextracts examined in this study, theconversation reported is culminated with theopponent?s reported extreme claim (ECF)occupying the last turn.
The occurrence of anECF at that marked place, that is, at thepunchline of the telling, is associated withissues of affiliation and stance since it isplaced exactly before the recipient?s slotupon story completion, which is a regularplace for the occurrence of evaluation(Schegloff, 1984).1 Introduction1Cyprus is an independent island republic in theEastern Mediterranean.
Data from the 2001 census ofpopulation showed that on 1st October 2001 the totalpopulation of the Cyprus Republic was 689,565composed of 89.7% Greek Cypriots, 0.2% Armenian,0.5% Maronites, 0.04% Cypriots of European origincalled ?Latins?
and 0.05% Turkish Cypriots; 0.1%did not declare their ethnic religious group (Census ofPopulation 2001); the remainder being foreignersfrom Europe and Asia.
The Greek speech communityin Cyprus is defined as diglossic.
Diglossia in Cyprusrefers to the simultaneous use of the dialect (CypriotGreek dialect, CD) and the demotic Greek (ModernGreek, MG).This article reports some of the findings of astudy of extreme case formulations (ECFs)(Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) inspontaneous conversations exclusivelyconducted in Cypriot Greek.In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drewattention to the conversational uses of extremecase formulations (ECFs).
Edwards (2000: 347-8) explains that ECFs are ?descriptions orassessments that deploy extreme expressionssuch as every, all, none, best, least, as good as itgets, always, perfectly, brand new, andabsolutely?.
Pomerantz (1986: 219-220)summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainlyused in complaints, in the following way:(1) to assert the strongest case inanticipation of non-sympathetichearings,(2) to propose the cause of a phenomenon,(3) to speak for the rightness (wrongness) ofa practice.Pomerantz?s (1986) three uses of ECFs arebasically oppositional and argumentative,occurring in environments where descriptionsand assessments are being strengthened orresisted.
As Edwards (2000) showed this appliesto his counselling data (1995) too, where wifeand husband produce and defend opposedversions of facts.
In this data a lot of ECFsfollow the same sequential pattern of ?ECF-challenge-softener?.
Although Pomerantz (1986)did not pursue post-ECF talk, she noted thechallenge after an ECF.However, as Edwards notes (2000: 360), ECFscan also occur in affiliative sequences as?upgrades and displays of affiliation being done,of agreement being full and so on?
?as inPomerantz?s (1984) demonstration of how1upgraded ?second assessments?
displayagreement.
ECFs make excellent upgrades (id.
).Added to this role, ECFs might be treated byparticipants as ?indexing the speaker?s stance orattitude?, what Edwards calls ?investments?(op.cit.
: 363-4).
As Edwards explains (id.
)denying or insisting on something in an extremeway can highlight the action of denying orinsisting, as a kind of stance or attitude (cf.Edwards & Potter, 1992; Potter 1996).
Finally,Edwards (2000: 365) draws attention to the?nonliteral or metaphoric uses of ECFs?
used inactions of exaggerating, teasing, ironizing,emphasizing, joking etc.2 Data and MethodologyThe study of ECFs investigated in this work isbased on recordings of informal, spontaneous,face-to-face conversations among close friendsor relatives.
These are exclusively conducted inCypriot Greek.
The conversations transcribed forthe present study are part of a collection ofrecordings that took place between December1998 and April 2003.
They comprisetranscriptions of 35 hours of tape-recordednatural interactions produced by young nativeCypriot Greek speakers during a variety ofgatherings or occasions, e.g.
dinner, gatheringfor coffee in friends?
houses etc.
The extractsincluded in this article comprise transcriptions ofapproximately 3 hour.
The recordings consist ofsame sex conversations among women.2The method that is adopted in the analysis of thedata is Conversation Analysis (CA), which hasits origins in the pioneering work in the sixtiesby the sociologist Harvey Sacks (1992a, 1992b).First and foremost, conversation analysis hasfocused its analytical attention on ?recorded,naturally occurring talk-in-interaction?
(Hutchbyand Wooffitt, 1998: 14).
These recordings ofactual speech are transcribed using a systemwhich is intended to capture in detail thecharacteristics ?of the sequencing of turns,including gaps, pauses and overlaps; and the2ECFs were also identified in a set of data collectedduring 2007 in conversations among young men.
Thetranscription revealed use of ECFs as upgradedassessments and in actions of joking andexaggerating.
Interestingly, no use of ECF incomplaints was found.element of speech delivery such as audiblebreath and laughter, stress, enunciation,intonation and pitch?
(Hutchby and Drew, 1995:182).The transcription symbols used in this study arebased on the transcription conventionsdeveloped by Jefferson for the analysis ofconversational turns in English conversation (seeSacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974) and areadopted in the form presented by Ochs,Schegloff and Thompson (1996) and Clift(1999).
The relevant transcription symbols forthis study are cited in appendix I.The phonetic inventory used for readingtranscription is based on the InternationalPhonetic Association [IPA] which is adjusted tothe Greek language by Nespor (1999) and on thephonetic inventory of Cypriot Greek presentedand described by Newton (1972).3 ECFs in Cypriot GreekMy data of spontaneous Cypriot-Greekconversations confirms Edwards?s (2000) andPomerantz?s claim (1986) of the use of ECFs inmaking complaints.In particular, this study reports a pattern of thesequential and interactional position of ECFsfound in the reporting of ?opposition-typestories?
(Schegloff, 1984) and in complainingabout a non-present party?s misbehaviour.
In theconversations examined here, complaining isexpressed with the narration of two-partyopposition-type stories in which the teller is oneof the two parties involved.
In particular,opposition-type stories are reported using theBCBC format, B being the teller and C his/heropponent.
Thus, that BCBC format tracks notonly the alternation of the turns but also thealternation of positions.
This formula turns out tohave C?s position be the one occupying the lastturn (Schegloff, 1984).
By ?reproducing the?original?
utterance or utterances, speakers canprovide access to the interaction being discussed,enabling the recipient to assess it for himself.Supplying this kind of evidence is importantwhen?..a complaint is made about someonebased on what they said?
(Holt, 1996: 229).It seems that the basic feature attributed toopposition type stories is that they are morethan any other form of storytelling ?recipient2designed?
(Sacks, 1971: 453).
If this is so, itmeans that tellers design the storytelling withan orientation to the specific recipients in orderto elicit their affiliative siding.
In the fragmentsunder study where the teller is one of theopposing parties, it is obviously important forthe teller to transmit to her recipients thecorrectness or appropriateness of her positionand the incorrectness or inappropriateness ofher opponent?s position.
In these extracts theteller invests special effort in constructing thecontrast between herself and her opponent intwo interrelated ways.
Therefore, this isaccomplished by narrating an opposition-typestory based on the conversation she had withthe opponent and by reporting the activities ofthe opponent parties which proposes thesignificance of the upcoming reported speech.Each story culminates in a report of the other?sspeech.
The motivation for the reporting ofspeech and activities is grounded inconsiderations of affiliation and stance.Actually in the conversations examined in thispaper the oppositional story has its punchline inthe reporting of an ECF attributed to the thirdnon-present party.
One thing the recipient can dois to side with one or the other, that is,teller/protagonist or his/her opponent.
Usuallyrecipients side with tellers because this is howtellers choose their story recipients (Schegloff,1984).
In the cases here the reported ECF isresponded to with a challenge taking the form ofrhetorical question, extreme case formulation,idiomatic expression or ironic evaluation.
Storiesinvolve extended single turns at talk (Sacks,1968: 18).
The storytelling sequence iscomposed ?of three serially ordered andadjacently placed types of sequences?
: ?thepreface, the telling, and the response sequences?
(Sacks, 1974: My main interest is in thepunchline and the recipient?s slot upon storycompletion.Due to the limit of space, I present only tworepresentative examples of the use ECF inthe punchline of opposition-type stories asshown in the extract 1 and 2 that follow.

then I?d bette::r,In extract 1 above the complaining proceeds asfollows: the teller is reporting the complainablebehavior of her opponent through reporting hertransgressions (1: 9-10, 12-13, 15-16) and thencontinues with the reporting of the oppositionalexchange (1: 20, 25-33) between her and heropponent which follows the BCBC format.The oppositional exchange culminates in apiece of formulaic-sounding wisdom profferedby the mother (1: 32-33: ?only when youbecome a mother will you understand?)
whichis hearable as an ?extra-ordinary?
claim(Pomerantz, 1986) framed as such based on theuse of the ECF ?only?
followed with theidiomatic expression ?when you become amother will you understand?.
According to3Mamas is a Cypriot journalist.Torode, ?an extreme case is designed to closean argument.
As such it is vulnerable toattempts at refutation?
(1996: 10).
Thus, theplacement of that extraordinary claim at theclimax of the story should be seen in relationto motivations of eliciting affiliation.
In otherwords the teller offers to the recipient anextreme claim in order to elicit a refutation ofthat claim.
The reporting of the opponent?swords effected by intonation, as it is shown inthe stress in voice and the louder tone, servesto detach the teller from commitment withthese words.
In 1: 34 the recipient challengesthe mother?s exaggerative claim with arhetorical question ?oh rea::lly??.
In agreementwith Schegloff?s claim, the suggested responsegets heard as a slot in the oppositionalconversation reported by the teller because itcomes off ?as a proposed piece?
of the teller?sargument (1984: 46-47).
The shift of footing(Goffman, 1979) from the mother?s reportedextreme claim to the rhetorical question frames(Goffman, 1974) the evaluation as irony.The following extract also serves to illustratethe point shown with extract 1 about theoccurrence of ECF at the climax of anoppositional story.

Thisannoys the girls very much.

I feel so tired.In extract (2) the teller announces that thecomplaint is about something the other (Lina)said to her (2: 1-2) and starts reporting theother?s words (2: 5-7), but restarts by reportingthe ?opposition?
type story from an earlierpoint (2: 7-12).This inserted oppositional story is hearable asbackground information essential for therecipients?
appreciation of the punchline.
Thepunchline, that is, the opponent?s words thatshe started reporting in 2: 5-7, but were leftunreported, are repeated and completed in 2:16-18.
In this story the teller presents theoppositional conversation in a BCBC formatwhere B is the teller and C the opponent, thatis, Lina.
The opponent is reported as makingthe questions and the teller as responding tothem.
The reported questions are presented asaggressive and challenging of the responsesgiven by the teller (2: 9-10, ?are you serious?he gets such a salary and he?ll quit??).
With thereported assessment of 2: 19-22, Lina ispresented as expressing her overt disapprovalof Panos?s claims which are also adapted byChristiana.
This is achieved with her reportedexaggerated claim that even if she was asked todo copying she would do it for the money.
Thisbecomes even more extreme because it isaccompanied with an ?extreme caseformulation?
(?all day?).
This is a strongcriticism of the teller and her friend?s beliefs.Christiana is complaining about her makingsuch a strong criticism of their beliefs.
Themimicked exaggeration in reproducing theopponent?s words effected with stretch andemphasis clearly detaches the teller from theirinside meaning.The reported claim is responded to with arhetorical question by one of the recipients (2:24-25).
This question is hearable as a slot inthe oppositional conversation reported by theteller because it comes off as a piece of thecomplainant?s argument.
With that shechallenges the opponent?s claim by bringing itinto question.
The repetition of the extremecase formulation ?all day?
is employed tochallenge the extreme claim of the opponent.This question is framed as an ironic challengebased on the impossibility of what is beingasked ?well >what did she get a master?s for,to make copies all day?<?
reinforced with the?extreme case?
?all day??.
This questionserves as an ironic challenge on another leveltoo, that of the shared knowledge that Lina isvery proud of having a master?s degree so herclaim is not true.
Hence, with this question therecipient claims disbelief of the opponent?sassessment.
In addition, this question serves asan ?impossible description?
(Torode, 1996).5As was mentioned above ECFs do not onlyoccur in reporting and responding toopposition-type stories, but also incomplaining about a non-present party?smisbehavior in general.
Extract 3 that followsis a representative example of that case.
(3)(C = Christiana; M = Maria; A = Angelina; P =Petra; E = Eleana.

C   ?nothI::Ng.6As was mentioned above in complaints it isimportant for the teller to establish his/herrecipients?
affiliation.
In my data, where theteller is complaining about another, this isusually achieved with extreme and hyperbolicdescriptions of the other?s misbehaviour.Thus, in 3: 1-3 the teller introduces acomplaint about a non-present party?smisbehaviour by soliciting a ?reminiscencerecognition?
from E, the knowing recipient(cf.
Lerner, 1992: 255) about the principalcharacter?s (cf.
Goodwin, 1984) behaviour.
Bycharacterizing Andie?s behaviour as a?syndrome?, the teller (3: 3) foreshows anegative telling/criticism of Andie andestablishes her stance towards the upcomingtelling.
In addition, through the reminiscencerecognition solicit she invites the knowingrecipient to confirm what it assesses andexpress a similar stance.
Since the addressedrecipient withholds a response, the tellerthrough an extreme description (3: 5-6)identified as such by the ECF ?every time?employs a second solicit of reminiscencerecognition (3: 5) addressed to E, the knowingrecipient.
E (3: 6) responds negatively to thesolicit and this is in disagreement with theexpectations of the solicit.
The teller initiates athird solicit of reminiscence recognition (3: 8-10) and finally receives recognition by theknowing recipient (3: 14-15).
The ECF ?everytime?
is repeated by the teller (3:18-20) in alast attempt to receive recognition.
Theaddressed recipient with a ?candidateunderstanding?
(Wilkinson and Kitzinger,2006) in the form of a question (3: 21) revealsrecognition of the connection between theinformation given in the preface and the topicof the upcoming telling, that is, what the storyis about and asks about it directly, ?so?
(.)
didshe do that last ni::ght too?
?.The telling (3: 22-23) is designed as a surprisesource as shown by the fact that it responds toa yes/no question (3: 21) with a detaileddescription of the third person?s misconductand the placement of the address form?guy::s?
in turn final position.
The telling isresponded to by the recipient (3: 24) with anassertion of ?ritualized disbelief?
(Heritage,1984: 339) which treats the prior utterance asnews (Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 2006).
Theteller in each of her turns (22-23, 27, 29-31,33, 35, 37) adds another increment whichforms part of the exaggerated description ofthe transgression of the principal character?sbehaviour.
The description of the other?stransgression has its climax in 3: 37.The recipients, that is, M (3: 38), A (3: 39) andP (3: 40-41) make an evaluation upon thestory-completion one after the other.
Thus M(3: 38) and A (3: 39) both display ?assertionsof ritualized disbelief?.
4 P (3: 40-41), producesa rhetorical question, identified as suchbecause it does not expect a response since itbrings into question a common knowledge.
Itis framed as ironic evaluation, based on thefact that is not sequentially linked to theprevious talk.
In addition, the extreme ECF?all her time?
adds to the ironic hearing.
Theironic evaluation conveyed is also recognizedbased on the shared knowledge that Andie isvisiting a priest often and consults with him.Hence, with this assertion P (3: 40-41) offersanother argument for Andie?s behaviour beingreprehensible by ironically evaluating herincompatible actions.
Her behaviour asdescribed by the teller contradicts the fact thatshe is known to spend a great deal of time withthe priest.4 ConclusionIn this paper I investigated one aspect of theinteractional and sequential workaccomplished with ECFs in complainingthrough a description of a non-present party?smisbehavior and in reporting opposition-typestories.
Specifically, the focus was oncomplaints about the behaviour of a third non-present party which develops with thereporting of two-party ?opposition type?exchanges in which the teller is one of the twoparties involved (Schegloff, 1984).
Thecontrasting positions are presented with theBCBC formula with the opponent?s positionoccupying the last turn.In exploring the sequential positioning ofECFs, I discovered that a regular place of their4These items ?treat a prior utterance as news forrecipient?
(Heritage, 1984: 339), but according toWilkinson and Kitzinger these kinds of assertions ?domore than this: they convey the speaker?s amazedincredulity and may also thus constitute a kind ofsurprise response in their own right?
(2006: 34).7occurrence in storytelling sequences is on thepunchline of the story and more specifically onthe culmination of the reporting of ?oppositiontype?
conversation.The occurrence of ECFs at the end of thetelling sequence seems to be associated withissues of affiliation that are sought from therecipients since the ?the story recipient?s slotafter story completion?
is a marked place forthe occurrence of evaluations where therecipient is expected to side either with theteller or her opponent.
(Schegloff, 1984: 44).Thus at this place the teller offers to therecipient something extreme to evaluate andchallenge.In the extracts above recipients respond withevaluations expressed with rhetorical questionswhich consist of repetitions of ?extreme caseformulation(s)?
(Pomerantz, 1986) and?impossible description(s)?
(Torode, 1996) ofa third person?s overbuilt claim or words.To sum up extracts (1 & 2) examined in thispaper revealed the following pattern:1.

This proves Sacks?s (1972: 341)observation that in some sequences certainactivities have regular places of occurrence tosuch an extent that their absence is noticeable.This observation leads ?to a distinctionbetween a ?slot?
