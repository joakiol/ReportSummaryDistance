As amatter of fact, the result will show ?
withone exception ?
the great stability of thesedeep structures.1 Introduction to the issueThrough the comparison of two data sets of  1300and of 1900, the present contribution discusses, ifand in which way the basic geolinguistic structureof Northern France (Domaine d?O?l) changed inthe course of this period.
In this investigation, anumber of different methods of dialectometry(DM) will be applied.
DM is a subdiscipline ofquantitative linguistics which concentrates on theexploration of the actual deep geolinguistic structu-res of a given space, using as data source linguisticatlases or similarly structured data collections(consisting of N inquiry points and p atlas or wor-king maps).
Of course, it has to be assumed thatthese deep structures were generated by a genuinespecific activity of man (i.e of of the homo lo-quens), that is to say: the ?
linguistic (or dialectal)management of space by the homo loquens ?.
Inso-far as man has obviously many other opportunitiesof managing a given natural space besides the lin-guistic management, there result many opportuni-ties for interdisciplinary cooperation with DM.The Salzburg-based DM (Goebl 2006a) pursuesthe genuine principles of traditional (Romance)linguistic geography with quantitative means.
Ittherefore defines its main aim in the empoweringof the diagnostic virtue of traditional linguisticgeography by introducing global or synthetic(quantitative) methods.2 Data basisIt consists of two machine-readable data matrices,the first resuming the period around 1300, theother one resuming the period around 1900.2.1 Corpus 1300 (drawn from Dees 1980)The medieval corpus was borrowed from the scrip-ta-atlas (1980) of the Amsterdam Romance linguistA.
Dees.
This atlas is based on the comprehensiveinterpretation of 3300 original charters of NorthernFrance of the second half of the 13th century,which were analysed in that instance according to alist of ca.
300 written (or scripta-) attributes.
Thesescripta-attributes are mainly of phonetic relevance,most of them referring to vocalism (189 attributes),but also to consonantism (87 attributes), and someof them even to morphology (22 attributes).
As aresult, the data matrix holds 298 attributes and 85?
inquiry points ?.
The latter correspond actually toscripta-centres (scriptoria, chanceries) which aredistributed as evenly as possible all over the Do-maine d?O?l.
For the measuring of the graphic va-riation in the 3300 charters, A. Dees developped aspecific method.
As a result, he was able to deter-mine ?
for each single attribute ?
its relative occur-rence (in percentage) in the charters of the 8575scripta-centres.
The content of the data matrix liestherefore on a metrical scale.In the ninetees, A. Dees and his collaborator Pietvon Reenen handed me over this data matrix, as abasis which allowed me to realize many dialecto-metrical experiments.
Its only disadvantage is thatthe machine-readable matrix holds less attributes(268) than the printed atlas (298).
Nevertheless, byapplying the ?
Average Euclidean Metric ?
(AEM), the ?
Average Manhattan Metric ?
(AMM)and the ?
Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficent ?
[r(BP)], the dialectometrical results are very profi-table (see Goebl 2006b).
The scripta-atlas publis-hed by Dees in 1980 shows quantitative visualisa-tions of the spatial distribution of the 298 attribu-tes, but does not encompass global data interpreta-tion with dialectometrical (or similar) methods.2.1.1 The Dees-data: one illustrative exampleIn his scripta-atlas (1980: carte 87, p. 93), A. Deesalso investigated the regional variation in the spel-ling of the French possessive pronoun: leur, leurs,leurz etc.
which are all derived from the Latin ety-mon ILL?RU.
Most probably they were createdunder the influence of a specific regional dialectpronunciation.
At the end of the 13th century, thegeographic contrast between these eu-spellings andthe older equivalent forms lor, lors, lors etc.
wasquite sharp in the Domaine d?O?l.
Hence, Deeschecked the number of all occurrences of eu-spellings (belonging to the possessive pronoun) inthe 3300 above mentioned charters and listed, foreach of the 85 scripta-centres of his atlas, the per-centages of those charters which show at least oneoccurence of the spelling -eu-.
As a result, 81 outof the 93 charters of the scripta-region 26?
Somme, Pas-de-Calais ?
(located in the medievalArtois: see the top of the figures 1, 3, 5 and 7)showed a considerable amount of eu-spellings, un-like the remaining 12 charters.
In the 105 chartersof the scripta-region 1 ?
Charente, Charente-Maritime ?
(South-western corner of the Domained?O?l), no occurrences of the eu-spellings werefound.
Obviously, the different spellings of thepossessive pronoun in that region were still on -o-.Thus, Dees registered the value 87% (= 81 : 93) forthe scripta-region 26 in the North and the value 0%for the scripta-region 1 in the South-west.As Dees analysed 298 scripta-features in the sameway, he succeeded in covering the whole range ofthe stressed and unstressed vocalism and conso-nantism of Old French.2.2 Corpus 1900 (drawn from ALF)The second corpus, referring to 1900, was drawnfrom the data of the French linguistic atlas ALF,precisely: from a data matrix which had been esta-blished in the process of dialectometrization of thetotal ALF grid.
The dimensions of this data matrixare: N = 641 inquiry points (distributed all overFrance), p = 1687 working maps, 1117 referring tophonetics (612 to vocalism, and 505 to consonan-tism), 417 referring to vocabulary, and 99 to mor-phology.
347 inquiry points (out of the 641 pointson the total ALF grid) are located in NorthernFrance : they represent therefore the Domained?O?l.
Among these 347 inquiry points, 85 pointswere selected in geographic correspondance to the85 scripta-centres of the Dees-atlas, and subse-quently reunited to a new grid (see the right halvesof Maps 1-8).Among the 1687 workings maps mentioned above,we took only into consideration those of phoneticrelevance, thus: 1117 maps.
They derived from247 original maps of the ALF by phonetic typiza-tion, which is a common procedure in Romancelinguistics.
The units of this ALF data matrix areupon the nominal scale.
With the supply of the?
Weighted Identity Value (with the weight 1) ?
[WIV (1)], the dialectometrical interpretation ofthis data matrix proved to be very successful (seeGoebl 1984, I: 83-86, and 2006a: 418-419).2.2.1 The ALF-data : two illustrative examplesAn example for two characteristic phonetic featu-res is given in Map 812 of the ALF le march?
?
themarket ?.
The 85 occurrences in the Domained?O?l all derive from the Latin etymon MERC?-TU.
The different dialectal followers of thestressed ?
which is considered in this instanceshow the following results: a) pronunciation with -i(19 ALF-points), b) with (closed) -?
(60 ALF-points), c) with (open) -?
(1 ALF-point), d) with -?
(4 ALF-points), e) with (neutral) -e (1 ALF-point).From the metrological point of view, these fivephonetic types represent what is called ?
(nominal)76multistate characters ?.
As the corresponding wor-king map contains five different (phonetic) types(or ?
taxates ?
in Salzburg terminology), it is calledas well a ?
5-nymic working map ?.Nevertheless, the data of the same ALF-map canalso be analysed according to consonantal princi-ples, which is realized by listing the dialectal re-sults of the postconsonantal C before stressed ?
inMERC?TU.
The results are as follows: a) ?
(72ALF-points), b) ?y (2), c) ts (1), d) t?y (3), e) k (2),f) t?
(3), g) ky (1), h) ty (1).
On the map, these eightconsonantal types show a geographic distributionwhich is far from being similar to the former oneof the five vocalic types.
Actually, this experienceis also valid for the great majority of our ALF-working maps.The reduced data matrix drawn from the integralALF-grid (with 1687 working maps) consists of914 working maps: it starts with 2-nymic maps andhas up to 23-nymic maps, embracing a total of4263 phonetic types or ?
taxates ?.3 Establishement of the dialectometricalmapsDM is a map-based discipline: It visualises sys-tematically all its results by using previously de-fined cartographic standards and by a very hand-some computer program called VDM (?
VisualDialectoMetry ?
), which supports and resets thesevisualisations perfectly.
With VDM, choroplethmaps and isarithmic maps, as well as trees can begenerated.
The results are always mapped in col-ours that are ranged according to the solar (or rain-bow) spectrum, the warm colours lying above thearithmetic means of the respective frequency dis-tribution, and the cold colours below it.
The treesare all ?
spatialized ?
in principle, which meansthat their structural information is projected di-rectly from the tree on the map.The comparison between the medieval versus themodern data occurs basically in visual form, a me-thodically correct procedure, as the two corre-sponding iconic patterns are established accordingto the same cartographic norms.
Further, the re-spective frequency distributions may also be corre-lated in order to gain a correlation map.
For rea-sons of space, this procedure will not be demon-strated in this paper.All the maps shown in section 4 are taken fromtwo square similarity matrices (N x N) consistingof 85 items (N = 85), calculated by means of spe-cial similarity indexes ?
AEM and WIV(1) ?
onthe basis of two data matrices (N = 85 ; p1300 = 268metrical attributes, p1900 = 1117 nominal attrib-utes).
Hence, this demonstration includes two simi-larity maps, two parameter maps, two interpointmaps and two trees (with the respective spatializa-tions).
These four comparison planes are actuallyof special relevance, by allowing a global compari-son which is also precise to the last detail of themedieval versus the modern data.4 Four comparison planes between 1300and 19004.1 Comparison plane 1 : two similarity mapsThe most important instrument of DM is the simi-larity map.
Each similarity map consists of a refer-ence point and N-1 similarity values distributed inspace, which values decrease proportionally withtheir geographical distance from the referencepoint.
The geographic pattern of the progressivedrop of these measurement values is clearly shownwith the cartographic means of DM.
In Maps 1 and2, the reference point is located in the Poitou(South-west).
The visual comparison of the twochoropleth profiles shows their great similarity.The same effect occurs also from the remaining 84reference points.
This means that the linguisticmanagement of the Domaine d?O?l was very simi-lar in the Middle Ages (through the linguistic ac-tivity of the scribes) and in modern times (throughthe linguistic activity of the dialect speakers).
Itmust be added that, generally speaking, medievalnon-Latin charters of the 13th and the 14th centu-ries (mainly) had a strong dialectal colouring, aphenomenon which was noted not in France only,they showed therefore a great number of localand/or regional written attributes.
In the 19th cen-tury already, it was assumed  that this graph(et)icvariation was generated or at least partly caused bythe oral variation of the different medieval dialects.In Northern France, this regional colouring of thecharters decreases rapidly after ca.
1400, and van-ishes after 1450.774.2 Comparison plane 2 : two parameter-maps : synopsis of the skewness valuesMaps 3 and 4 reveal an entirely different question.The synopsis (or combination) of the N skewnessvalues of a given similarity matrix indicates thedegree of variation between different regions inregard to the so-called ?
linguistic compromise orexchange ?.
This phenomenon is defined as thedegree of the intermixing of geolinguistic attributeswith (respectively) regionally varying extensionand/or intensity.
Our DM-classification distinguis-hes therefore zones of high linguistic compromise(here : clear shadings) and zones of weak linguisticcompromise (here : dark shadings).
Where this lin-guistic exchange is high or great, a strong linguis-tic intermixing is prevailing.
Where it is weak, thelinguistic interaction is also low: these areas wenton keeping a strong linguistic autonomy and werenot yet seized by the general intermixing.In Map 3 (left), the zones of high linguistic com-promise or exchange form a kind of cross: they arelocated in the centre of the Domaine d?O?l, whe-reas on its peripherical boarders the areas of diffe-rent historical provinces (such as: Normandy, Pi-cardy, Lorraine, etc.)
are found.
In Map 4 (right),the clear shaded zone occupies now the main partof the grid of the Domaine d?O?l: in comparisonwith the left map it has virtually ?
exploded ?
(notethe black circle), as a consequence of the conti-nuous expansion of the language type of the Ile-de-France, which had been strongly supported by theFrench kings and after 1789 also by the Republic.Only on the Eastern peripherical boarders, someprovinces (Picardy, the Walloons, Lorraine, etc.
)could elude the general language compromise andthus the general linguistic intermixing.Both maps consist of respectively 85 skewnessvalues which were gained by respectively 85 simi-larity distributions.
Since almost 20 years, it iswell-known that the skewness value is an excellentinstrument for measuring language compromise orexchange; in many instances, evidence of this facthas been given with different data sets (see Goebl1984, I: 150-153, and 2006a: 419-420).4.3 Comparison plane 3 : two interpoint orhoneycomb mapsActually, Maps 5 and 6 represent two honeycombmaps, each of them consisting of 225 polygon si-des which vary according to thickness and dark-ness.
Every one of these polygon sides lies bet-ween (= inter) contiguous inquiry points (hence thename interpoint map), and indicates virtually therelative dialectal differences.
Instead of the linguis-tic similarities (sim), the potential linguistic diffe-rences or distances (dist) were mapped.
In quanti-tative regard, they are interrelated according to theformula: dist + sim = 100.
Thus, the distance re-lated counterpart of the above mentioned similarityindex WIV(1) is the WDV (1) (?
Weighted Dis-tance Value (with the weight 1)) ?.The cartographic message of the two maps largelycorresponds to the evidence of the traditional iso-gloss syntheses which were commonly establishedduring the 20th century in Romance, German andEnglish linguistics.
The thick (and dark) polygonsides represent the so called ?
linguistic bounda-ries?, a linguistic term which is rather colloquialand imprecise.
One clearly recognizes that in Map5 (left) in the North (Picardy) and the South-west(Poitou, Saintonge) there are very prominent anddistinct ?
boundaries ?.
But it also shows veryclearly in Map 6 (right) that in the period between1300 and 1900 these ?
boundaries ?
were moved tothe North (and East) as well as to the utmost bor-ders of the South by an ?
invisible force ?
and thata zone with only very weak interpunctual demarca-tions emerged in the middle of the Domaine d?O?l.Our knowledge of the history of the French lan-guage allows us to identify this ?
invisible force ?
:it is the irradiation of the linguistic type of the Ile-de-France, pushed by the politics.4.4 Comparison plane 4: two dendrographicanalyses (following Ward?s method)Moreover, the two similarity matrices can first beprocessed by dendrographic methods, in a nextstep, the two trees are compared.
In this procedure,one has to pay attention to those bifurcations of thetree which are located near the trunk (or the root).Among the relevant ?
hierarchic agglomerativemethods ?
applied for the generation of trees,Ward?s method has proved to be most appropriate.In Maps 7 and 8, the tree and the map were drawn78and visualised, isolating thereby (respectively)three distinct cartographic clusters.
These clustersare called ?
dendremes ?
in the tree, and their cor-respondences on the map ?
choremes ?.
The heu-ristic comparison of Maps 7 and 8 concentrates onthe position of the dendremes in the tree and simul-taneously on the position of the choremes on themap.
First, the perfect spatial coherence of all cho-remes is striking.
Further, it clearly results that thethree dendremes (No.
1-3) at the top seize the East,the North and the Centre (including the West) ofthe Domaine d?O?l, though in such a way that thecentral dendreme-choreme (No.
1) expanded in thecourse of the six centuries between 1300 and 1900at the expense of the Eastern (No.
3) and the Nor-thern (No.
2) choreme-dendreme.
Again, this is aconsequence of the irradiation of the dialect of theIle-de-France, supported by the French royal dy-nasty and the Republic.5 Final remarksBy the visual comparison of four pairs of mapsestablished with dialectometrical methods, evi-dence was given that the geolinguistic deep struc-tures of the Domaine d?O?l (Northern France) ?
inthe period between 1300 and 1900 ?
maintained alarge stability, that is to say : remained mostlyidentical in regard to their phonetics.
Hence thequestion arises on determining the chronologicaldevelopment and elaboration before 1300 of  thesephonetic deep structures.
Nevertheless, the presentinvestigation revealed the actual expansion of thelinguistic type of the Ile-de-France between 1300and 1900 which represents the typological basis forstandard French.
The dialectometrical techniques,which were again applied in this contribution, haveproven many times their great diagnostic value inthe last three decades.ReferencesALF: Jules Gilli?ron and Edmond Edmont.
