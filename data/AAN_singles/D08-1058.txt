Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 553?561,Honolulu, October 2008. c?2008 Association for Computational LinguisticsUsing Bilingual Knowledge and Ensemble Techniques for UnsupervisedChinese Sentiment AnalysisXiaojun WanInstitute of Compute Science and TechnologyPeking UniversityBeijing 100871, Chinawanxiaojun@icst.pku.edu.cnAbstractIt is a challenging task to identify sentimentpolarity of Chinese reviews because the re-sources for Chinese sentiment analysis arelimited.
Instead of leveraging only monolin-gual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes anovel approach to leverage reliable Englishresources to improve Chinese sentimentanalysis.
Rather than simply projecting Eng-lish resources onto Chinese resources, our ap-proach first translates Chinese reviews intoEnglish reviews by machine translation ser-vices, and then identifies the sentiment polar-ity of English reviews by directly leveragingEnglish resources.
Furthermore, our approachperforms sentiment analysis for both Chinesereviews and English reviews, and then usesensemble methods to combine the individualanalysis results.
Experimental results on adataset of 886 Chinese product reviews dem-onstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-proach.
The individual analysis of thetranslated English reviews outperforms the in-dividual analysis of the original Chinese re-views, and the combination of the individualanalysis results further improves the perform-ance.1 IntroductionIn recent years, sentiment analysis (including sub-jective/objective analysis, polarity identification,opinion extraction, etc.)
has drawn much attentionin the NLP field.
In this study, the objective of sen-timent analysis is to annotate a given text for polar-ity orientation (positive/negative).
Polarityorientation identification has many useful applica-tions, including opinion summarization (Ku et al,2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi andLavrenko, 2006).To date, most of the research focuses on Englishand a variety of reliable English resources for sen-timent analysis are available, including polaritylexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc.
However,the resources for other languages are limited.
Inparticular, few reliable resources are available forChinese sentiment analysis1 and it is not a trivialtask to manually label reliable Chinese sentimentresources.Instead of using only the limited Chinese knowl-edge, this study aims to improve Chinese sentimentanalysis by making full use of bilingual knowledgein an unsupervised way, including both Chineseresources and English resources.
Generally speak-ing, there are two unsupervised scenarios for ?bor-rowing?
English resources for sentiment analysisin other languages: one is to generate resources ina new language by leveraging on the resourcesavailable in English via cross-lingual projections,and then perform sentiment analysis in the Englishlanguage based on the generated resources, whichhas been investigated by Mihalcea et al (2007);the other is to translate the texts in a new languageinto English texts, and then perform sentimentanalysis in the English language, which has not yetbeen investigated.In this study, we first translate Chinese reviewsinto English reviews by using machine translationservices, and then identify the sentiment polarity ofEnglish reviews by directly leveraging Englishresources.
Furthermore, ensemble methods areemployed to combine the individual analysis re-sults in each language (i.e.
Chinese and English) inorder to obtain improved results.
Given machinetranslation services between the selected targetlanguage and English, the proposed approach canbe applied to any other languages as well.Experiments have been performed on a datasetof 886 Chinese product reviews.
Two commercial1 This study focuses on Simplified Chinese.553machine translation services (i.e.
Google Translateand Yahoo Babel Fish) and a baseline dictionary-based system are used for translating Chinese re-views into English reviews.
Experimental resultsshow that the analysis of English reviews trans-lated by the commercial translation services out-performs the analysis of original Chinese reviews.Moreover, the analysis performance can be furtherimproved by combining the individual analysisresults in different languages.
The results alsodemonstrate that our proposed approach is moreeffective than the approach that leverages gener-ated Chinese resources.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 introduces related work.
The proposedapproach is described in detail in Section 3.
Sec-tion 4 shows the experimental results.
Lastly weconclude this paper in Section 5.2 Related WorkPolarity identification can be performed on wordlevel, sentence level or document level.
Relatedwork for word-level polarity identification includes(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kim andHovy.
2004; Takamura et al, 2005; Yao et al2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007), and relatedwork for sentence-level polarity identification in-cludes (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim andHovy.
2004) Word-level or sentence-level senti-ment analysis is not the focus of this paper.Generally speaking, document-level polarityidentification methods can be categorized into un-supervised and supervised.Unsupervised methods involve deriving a senti-ment metric for text without training corpus.
Tur-ney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation ofa review by the average semantic orientation of thephrases in the review that contain adjectives oradverbs, which is denoted as the semantic orientedmethod.
Kim and Hovy (2004) build three modelsto assign a sentiment category to a given sentenceby combining the individual sentiments of senti-ment-bearing words.
Hiroshi et al (2004) use thetechnique of deep language analysis for machinetranslation to extract sentiment units in text docu-ments.
Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) determine thesentiment of a customer review by counting posi-tive and negative terms and taking into accountcontextual valence shifters, such as negations andintensifiers.
Devitt and Ahmad (2007) explore acomputable metric of positive or negative polarityin financial news text.Supervised methods consider the sentimentanalysis task as a classification task and use la-beled corpus to train the classifier.
Since the workof Pang et al (2002), various classification modelsand linguistic features have been proposed to im-prove the classification performance (Pang and Lee,2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al,2005a; Read, 2005).
Most recently, McDonald et al(2007) investigate a structured model for jointlyclassifying the sentiment of text at varying levelsof granularity.
Blitzer et al (2007) investigate do-main adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusingon online reviews for different types of products.Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008) present a newsystem consisting of the ensemble of a corpus-based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier withprecision-based vote weighting.Research work focusing on Chinese sentimentanalysis includes (Tsou et al, 2005; Ye et al, 2006;Li and Sun, 2007; Wang et al, 2007).
Such workrepresents heuristic extensions of the unsupervisedor supervised methods for English sentimentanalysis.To date, the most closely related work is Mihal-cea et al (2007), which explores cross-lingual pro-jections to generate subjectivity analysis resourcesin Romanian by leveraging on the tools and re-sources available in English.
They have investi-gated two approaches: a lexicon-based approachbased on Romanian subjectivity lexicon translatedfrom English lexicon, and a corpus-based approachbased on Romanian subjectivity-annotated corporaobtained via cross-lingual projections.
In this study,we focus on unsupervised sentiment polarity iden-tification and we only investigate the lexicon-basedapproach in the experiments.Other related work includes subjective/objectiveanalysis (Hatzivassiloglon and Wiebe, 2000; Riloffand Wiebe, 2003) and opinion mining and summa-rization (Liu et al, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni.2005; Choi et al, 2006; Ku et al, 2006; Titov andMcDonald, 2008).3 The Proposed Approach3.1 OverviewThe motivation of our approach is to make full useof bilingual knowledge to improve sentimentanalysis in a target language, where the resources554for sentiment analysis are limited or unreliable.This study focuses on unsupervised polarity identi-fication of Chinese product reviews by using boththe rich English knowledge and the limited Chi-nese knowledge.The framework of our approach is illustrated inFigure 1.
A Chinese review is translated into thecorresponding English review using machine trans-lation services, and then the Chinese review andthe English review are analyzed based on Chineseresources and English resources, respectively.
Theanalysis results are then combined to obtain moreaccurate results under the assumption that the indi-vidual sentiment analysis can complement eachother.
Note that in the framework, different ma-chine translation services can be used to obtaindifferent English reviews, and the analysis of Eng-lish reviews translated by a specific machine trans-lation service is conducted separately.
Forsimplicity, we consider the English reviews trans-lated by different machine translation services asreviews in different languages, despite the fact thatin essence, they are still in English.Figure 1.
Framework of our approachFormally, give a review rev0 in the target lan-guage (i.e.
Chinese), the corresponding review reviin the ith language is obtained by using a transla-tion function:  revi =f iTrans(rev0)?
where 1?i?p andp is the total number of machine translation ser-vices.
For each review revk in the kth language(0?k?p), we employ the semantic oriented ap-proach to assign a semantic orientation valuef kSO(revk) to the review, and the polarity orientationof the review can be simply predicated based onthe value by using a threshold.
Given a set of se-mantic orientation values FSO={f kSO(revk) | 0?k?p},the ensemble methods aim to derive a new seman-tic orientation value )( 0revf EnsembleSO based on thevalues in FSO, which can be used to better classifythe review as positive or negative.The steps of review translation, individual se-mantic orientation value computation and ensem-ble combination are described in details in the nextsections, respectively.3.2 Review TranslationTranslation of a Chinese review into an Englishreview is the first step of the proposed approach.Manual translation is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it is not feasible to manually trans-late a large amount of Chinese product reviews inreal applications.
Fortunately, machine translationtechniques have been well developed in the NLPfield, though the translation performance is farfrom satisfactory.
A few commercial machinetranslation services can be publicly accessed.
Inthis study, the following two commercial machinetranslation services and one baseline system areused to translate Chinese reviews into English re-views.Google Translate 2  (GoogleTrans): GoogleTranslate is one of the state-of-the-art commercialmachine translation systems used today.
GoogleTranslate applies statistical learning techniques tobuild a translation model based on both monolin-gual text in the target language and aligned textconsisting of examples of human translations be-tween the languages.Yahoo Babel Fish 3  (YahooTrans): Differentfrom Google Translate, Yaho Babel Fish usesSYSTRAN?s rule-based translation engine.SYSTRAN was one of the earliest developers ofmachine translation software.
SYSTRAN appliescomplex sets of specific rules defined by linguiststo analyze and then transfer the grammatical struc-ture of the source language into the target language.Baseline Translate (DictTrans): We simply de-velop a translation method based only on one-to-one term translation in a large Chinese-to-English2 http://translate.google.com/translate_t3 http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txtChinesereviewChineseResourceEnglishreviewMachinetranslationChinesesentimentanalysisEnsembleEnglishsentimentanalysisEnglishResourcePolarityValuePolarityValuePos\Neg555dictionary.
Each term in a Chinese review is trans-lated by the first corresponding term in the Chi-nese-to-English dictionary, without any otherprocessing steps.
In this study, we use theLDC_CE_DIC2.04 constructed by LDC as the dic-tionary for translation, which contains 128366Chinese terms and their corresponding Englishterms.The Chinese-to-English translation perform-ances of the two commercial systems are deemedmuch better than the weak baseline system.
GoogleTranslate has achieved very good results on theChinese-to-English translation tracks of NIST openmachine translation test (MT)5 and it ranks the firston most tracks.
In the Chinese-to-English task ofMT2005, the BLEU-4 score of Google Translate is0.3531, and the BLEU-4 score of SYSTRAN is0.1471.
We can deduce that Google Translate isbetter than Yahoo Babel Fish, without consideringthe recent improvements of the two systems.Here are two running example of Chinese re-views and the translated English reviews (Human-Trans refers to human translation):Positive Example: ????,?????
?HumanTrans: Many advantages and very good shape.GoogleTrans: Many advantages, the shape is also verygood.YahooTrans: Merit very many, the contour very is alsogood.DictTrans: merit very many figure also very goodNegative example: ?????????
?HumanTrans: The memory is too small to support IR.GoogleTrans: Memory is too small not to support IR.YahooTrans:The memory too is small does not supportinfrared.DictTrans: memory highest small negative not to be infavor of ir.3.3 Individual Semantic Orientation ValueComputationFor any specific language, we employ the semanticorientated approach (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006)to compute the semantic orientation value of a re-view.
The unsupervised approach is quite  straight-forward and it makes use of the followingsentiment lexicons: positive Lexicon (Posi-tive_Dic) including terms expressing positive po-larity, Negative Lexicon (Negative_Dic) includingterms expressing negative polarity, Negation4 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm5 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/Lexicon (Negation_Dic) including terms that areused to reverse the semantic polarity of a particularterm, and Intensifier Lexicon (Intensifier_Dic)including terms that are used to change the degreeto which a term is positive or negative.
In thisstudy, we conduct our experiments within two lan-guages, and we collect and use the following popu-lar and available Chinese and English sentimentlexicons6, without any further filtering and labeling:1) Chinese lexiconsPositive_Diccn: 3730 Chinese positive termswere collected from the Chinese Vocabulary forSentiment Analysis (VSA)7 released by HOWNET.Negative_Diccn: 3116 Chinese negative termswere collected from Chinese Vocabulary for Sen-timent Analysis (VSA) released by HOWNET.Negation_Diccn: 13 negation terms were col-lected from related papers.Intensifier_Diccn: 148 intensifier terms werecollected from Chinese Vocabulary for SentimentAnalysis (VSA) released by HOWNET.2) English lexiconsPositive_Dicen: 2718 English positive termswere collected from the feature file subjclueslen1-HLTEMNLP05.tff 8  containing the subjectivityclues used in the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wil-son et al, 2005b).
The clues in this file were col-lected from a number of sources.
Some were culledfrom manually developed resources, e.g.
generalinquirer9 (Stone et al, 1966).
Others were identi-fied automatically using both annotated and unan-notated data.
A majority of the clues werecollected as part of work reported in Riloff andWiebe (2003).Negative_Dicen: 4910 English negative termswere collected from the same file described above.Negation_Dicen: 88 negation terms were col-lected from the feature file valenceshifters.tff usedin the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wilson et al,2005b).Intensifier_Dicen: 244 intensifier terms werecollected from the feature file intensifiers2.tff usedin the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wilson et al,2005b).6 In this study, we focus on using a few popular resources inboth Chinese and English for comparative study, instead oftrying to collect and use all available resources.7 http://www.keenage.com/html/e_index.html8 http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/9 http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm556The semantic orientation value f kSO(revk) for revkis computed by summing the polarity values of allwords in the review, making use of both the wordpolarity defined in the positive and negative lexi-cons and the contextual valence shifters defined inthe negation and intensifier lexicons.
The algo-rithm is illustrated in Figure 2.Input: a review revk in the kth language.
Four lexi-cons in the kth language: Positive_Dick, Nega-tive_Dick, Negation_Dick, Intensifier_Dick, which areeither Chinese or English lexicons;Output: Polarity Value f kSO(revk);Algorithm Compute_SO:1.
Tokenize review revk into sentence set S and eachsentence s?S  is tokenized into word set Ws;2.
For any word w in a sentence s?S, compute itsSO value SO(w) as follows:1) if w?Positive_Dick , SO(w)=PosValue;2) If w?Negative_Dick, SO(w)=NegValue;3) Otherwise, SO(w)=0;4) Within the window of q words previous tow, if there is a term w?

The algorithm for semantic orientation valuecomputationIn the above algorithm, PosValue and Neg-Value are the polarity values for positive wordsand negative words respectively.
We empiricallyset PosValue=1 and NegValue= ?2 because nega-tive words usually contribute more to the overallsemantic orientation of the review than positivewords, according to our empirical analysis.
?>1aims to intensify the polarity value and we simplyset ?=2.
q is the parameter controlling the windowsize within which the negation terms and intensi-fier terms have influence on the polarity words andhere q is set to 2 words.
Note that the above pa-rameters are tuned only for Chinese sentimentanalysis, and they are used for sentiment analysisin the English language without further tuning.
Thetokenization of Chinese reviews involves Chineseword segmentation.Usually, if the semantic orientation value of areview is less than 0, the review is labeled as nega-tive, otherwise, the review is labeled as positive.3.4 Ensemble CombinationAfter obtaining the set of semantic orientation val-ues FSO={f kSO(revk) | 0?k?p} by using the semanticoriented approach, where p is the number of Eng-lish translations for each Chinese review, we ex-ploit the following ensemble methods for derivinga new semantic orientation value )( 0revf EnsembleSO :1) AverageIt is the most intuitive combination method andthe new value is the average of the values in FSO:1)()( 00+=?=prevfrevfpkkkSOEnsembleSONote that after the new value of a review is ob-tained, the polarity tag of the review is assigned inthe same way as described in Section 3.3.2) Weighted AverageThis combination method improves the averagecombination method by associating each individualvalue with a weight, indicating the relative confi-dence in the value.

[0, 1] is the weight associated withf kSO(revk).
The weights can be set in the followingtwo ways:Weighting Scheme1: The weight of f kSO(revk) isset to the accuracy of the individual analysis in thekth language.Weighting Scheme2: The weight of f kSO(revk) isset to be the maximal correlation coefficient be-tween the analysis results in the kth language andthe analysis results in any other language.
Theunderlying idea is that if the analysis results in onelanguage are highly consistent with the analysisresults in another language, the results are deemedto be more reliable.
Given two lists of semanticvalues for all reviews, we use the Pearson?s corre-lation coefficient to measure the correlation be-tween them.
The weight associated with function fkSO(revk) is then defined as the maximal Pearson?scorrelation coefficient between the reviews?

A review can obtain p+1 polarity tags basedon the individual analysis results in the p+1 lan-guages.
The polarity tag receiving more votes ischosen as the final polarity tag of the review.4 Empirical Evaluation4.1 Dataset and Evaluation MetricsIn order to assess the performance of the proposedapproach, we collected 1000 product reviews froma popular Chinese IT product web site-IT16810 .The reviews were posted by users and they focusedon such products as mp3 players, mobile phones,digital camera and laptop computers.
Users usuallyselected for each review an icon indicating ?pos-tive?
or ?negative?.
The reviews were first catego-rized into positive and negative classes accordingto the associated icon.
The polarity labels for thereviews were then checked by subjects.
Finally, thedataset contained 886 product reviews with accu-rate polarity labels.
All the 886 reviews were usedas test set.We used the standard precision, recall and F-measure to measure the performance of positiveand negative class, respectively, and used the Mac-roF measure and accuracy metric to measure theoverall performance of the system.
The metrics aredefined the same as in general text categorization.4.2 Individual Analysis ResultsIn this section, we investigate the following indi-vidual sentiment analysis results in each specifiedlanguage:CN: This method uses only Chinese lexiconsto analyze Chinese reviews;10 http://www.it168.comGoogleEN: This method uses only English lex-icons to analyze English reviews translated byGoogleTrans;YahooEN: This method uses only English lex-icons to analyze English reviews translated by Ya-hooTrans;DictEN: This method uses only English lexi-cons to analyze English reviews translated byDictTrans;In addition to the above methods for usingEnglish resources, the lexicon-based method inves-tigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use Eng-lish resources by directly projecting Englishlexicons into Chinese lexicons.
We use a largeEnglish-to-Chinese dictionary -LDC_EC_DIC2.011  with 110834 entries for pro-jecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons viaone-to-one translation.
Based on the generatedChinese lexicons, two other individual methods areinvestigated in the experiments:CN2: This method uses only the generatedChinese Resources to analyze Chinese reviews.CN3: This method combines the original Chi-nese lexicons and the generated Chinese lexiconsand uses the extended lexicons to analyze Chinesereviews.Table 1 provides the performance values of allthe above individual methods.
Seen from the table,the performances of GoogleEN and YahooEN aremuch better than the baseline CN method, andeven the DictEN performs as well as CN.
The re-sults demonstrate that the use of English resourcesfor sentiment analysis of translated English re-views is an effective way for Chinese sentimentanalysis.
We can also see that the English senti-ment analysis performance relies positively on thetranslation performance, and GoogleEN performsthe best while DictEN performs the worst, whichis consistent with the fact the GoogleTrans isdeemed the best of the three machine translationsystems, while DictTrans is the weakest one.Furthermore, the CN method outperforms theCN2 and CN3 methods, and the CN2 method per-forms the worst, which shows that the generatedChinese lexicons do not give any contributions tothe performance of Chinese sentiment analysis.
Weexplain the results by the fact that the term-basedone-to-one translation is inaccurate and the gener-ated Chinese lexicons are not reliable.
Overall, the11 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm558approach through cross-lingual lexicon translationdoes not work well for Chinese sentiment analysisin our experiments.4.3 Ensemble ResultsIn this section, we first use the simple average en-semble method to combine different individualanalysis results.
Table 2 provides the performancevalues of the average ensemble results based ondifferent individual methods.Seen from Tables 1 and 2, almost all of the av-erage ensembles outperforms the baseline CNmethod and the corresponding individual methods,which shows that each individual methods havetheir own evidences for sentiment analysis, andthus fusing the evidences together can improveperformance.
For the methods of CN+GoogleEN,CN+YahooEN and CN+DictEN, we can see theensemble performance is not positively relying onthe translation performance: CN+YahooEN per-forms better than CN+GoogleEN, and evenCN+DictEN performs as well as CN+GoogleEN.The results show that the individual methods in theensembles can complement each other, and eventhe combination of two weak individual methodscan achieve good performance.
However, the Dic-tEN method is not effective when the ensemblemethods have already included GoogleEN andYahooEN.
Overall, the performances of the en-semble methods rely on the performances of themost effective constituent individual methods: themethods including both GoogleEN and YahooENperform much better than other methods, andCN+GoogleEN+YahooEN performs the best outof all the methods.We further show the results of four typical av-erage ensembles by varying the combinationweights.
The combination weights are respectivelyspecified as ??CN+(1-?
)?GoogleEN, ??CN+(1-?
)?YahooEN, ??CN+(1-?)?DictEN,?1?CN+?2?GoogleEN+(1-?1-?2)?YahooEN.
The resultsover the MacroF metric are shown in Figures 3 and4 respectively.
We can see from the figures thatGoogleEN and YahooEN are dominant factors inthe ensemble methods.We then investigate to use other ensemble meth-ods introduced in Section 3.4 to combine the CN,GoogleEN and YahooEN methods.
Table 3 givesthe comparison results.
The methods of ?WeightedAverage1?
and ?Weighted Average2?
are twoweighted average ensembles using the two weigh-ing schemes, respectively.
We can see that all theensemble methods outperform the constituent indi-vidual method, while the two weighted averageensembles perform the best.
The results furtherdemonstrate the good effectiveness of the ensem-ble combination of individual analysis results forChinese sentiment analysis.Positive Negative Total Individual Method Precision Recall F-measure Precision Recall F-measure MacroF AccuracyCN 0.681 0.929 0.786 0.882 0.549 0.677 0.732 0.743CN2 0.615 0.772 0.684 0.678 0.499 0.575 0.630 0.638CN3 0.702 0.836 0.763 0.788 0.632 0.702 0.732 0.736GoogleEN 0.764 0.914 0.832 0.888 0.708 0.787 0.810 0.813YahooEN 0.763 0.871 0.814 0.844 0.720 0.777 0.795 0.797DictEN 0.738 0.761 0.749 0.743 0.720 0.731 0.740 0.740Table 1.

Ensemble results for CN & GoogleEN & YahooEN5 Conclusion and Future WorkThis paper proposes a novel approach to use Eng-lish sentiment resources for Chinese sentimentanalysis by employing machine translation andensemble techniques.
Chinese reviews are trans-lated into English reviews and the analysis resultsof both Chinese reviews and English reviews arecombined to improve the overall accuracy.
Ex-perimental results demonstrate the encouragingperformance of the proposed approach.In future work, more additional English re-sources will be used to further improve the results.We will also apply the idea to supervised Chinesesentiment analysis.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National ScienceFoundation of China (No.60703064), the ResearchFund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Educa-tion of China (No.20070001059) and the NationalHigh Technology Research and Development Pro-gram of China (No.2008AA01Z421).
