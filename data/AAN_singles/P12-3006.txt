One of the major challenges formultilingual chat realized through machinetranslation technology is the normalization ofnon-standard, self-created short-forms in thechat message to standard words beforetranslation.
Due to the lack of training data andthe variations of short-forms used amongdifferent social communities, it is hard tonormalize and translate chat messages if useruses vocabularies outside the training data andcreate short-forms freely.
We develop apersonalized chat normalizer for English andintegrate it with a multilingual chat system,allowing user to create and use personalizedshort-forms in multilingual chat.1 IntroductionProcessing user-generated textual content on socialmedia and networking usually encounterschallenges due to the language used by the onlinecommunity.
Though some jargons of the onlinelanguage has made their way into the standarddictionary, a large portion of the abbreviations,slang and context specific terms are stilluncommon and only understood within the usercommunity.
Consequently, content analysis ortranslation techniques developed for a more formalgenre like news or even conversations cannotapply directly and effectively to the social mediacontent.
In recent years, there are many works (Awet al, 2006; Cook et al, 2009; Han et al, 2011) ontext normalization to preprocess user generatedcontent such as tweets and short messages beforefurther processing.
The approaches includesupervised or unsupervised methods based onmorphological and phonetic variations.
However,most of the multilingual chat systems on theInternet have not yet integrated this feature intotheir systems but requesting users to type in properlanguage so as to have good translation.
This isbecause the current techniques are not robustenough to model the different characteristicsfeatured in the social media content.
Most of thetechniques are developed based on observationsand assumptions made on certain datasets.
It is alsodifficult to unify the language uniqueness amongdifferent users into a single model.We propose a practical and effective method,exploiting a personalized dictionary for each user,to support the use of user-defined short-forms in amultilingual chat system - AsiaSpik.
The use of thispersonalized dictionary reduces the reliance on theavailability and dependency of training data andempowers the users with the flexibility andinteractivity to include and manage their ownvocabularies during chat.2 ASIASPIK System OverviewAsiaSpik is a web-based multilingual instantmessaging system that enables online chats writtenin one language to be readable in other languagesby other users.
Figure 1 describes the systemprocess.
It describes the process flow betweenChat Client, Chat Server, Translation Bot andNormalization Bot whenever Chat Client startschat module.When Chat Client starts chat module, the ChatClient checks if the normalization option for thatlanguage used by the user is active and activated.
If31so, any message sent by the user will be routed tothe Normalization Bot for normalization beforereaching the Chat Server.
The Chat Server thendirects the message to the designated recipients.Chat Client at each recipient invokes a translationrequest to the Translation Bot to translate themessage to the language set by the recipient.
Thisallows the same source message to be received bydifferent recipients in different target languages.Figure 1.
AsiaSpik Chat Process FlowIn this system, we use Openfire Chat Server byIgnite Realtime as our Chat Server.
We custombuild a web-based Chat Client to communicatewith the Chat Server based on Jabber/XMPP toreceive presence and messaging information.
Wealso develop a user management plug-in tosynchronize and authenticate user login.
Thetranslation and normalization function used by theTranslation Bot and Normalization Bot areprovided through Web Services.The Translation Web Service uses in-housetranslation engines and supports the translationfrom Chinese, Malay and Indonesian to Englishand vice versa.
Multilingual chat among theselanguages is achieved through pivot translationusing English as the pivot language.
TheNormalization Web Service supports only Englishnormalization.
Both web services are running onApache Tomcat web server with Apache Axis2.3 Personalized NormalizationPersonalized Normalization is the main distinctionof AsiaSpik among other multilingual chat system.It gives the flexibility for user to personalizehis/her short-forms for messages in English.3.1 Related WorkThe traditional text normalization strategy followsthe noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948).

?Recently, Aw et al (2006) model text messagenormalization as translation from the textinglanguage into the standard language.
Choudhury etal.
(2007) model the word-level text generationprocess for SMS messages, by consideringgraphemic/phonetic abbreviations andunintentional typos as hidden Markov model(HMM) state transitions and emissions,respectively.
Cook and Stevenson (2009) expandthe error model by introducing inference fromdifferent erroneous formation processes, accordingto the sample error distribution.
Han and Baldwin(2011) use a classifier to detect ill-formed words,and generate correction candidates based onmorphophonemic similarity.
These models areeffective on their experiments conducted, however,much works remain to be done to handle thediversity and dynamic of content and fast evolutionof words used in social media and networking.As we notice that unlike spelling errors whichare made mostly unintentionally by the writers,abbreviations or slangs found in chat messages areintroduced intentionally by the senders most of thetime.
This leads us to suggest that if facilities aregiven to users to define their abbreviations, thedynamic of the social content and the fast32evolution of words could be well captured andmanaged by the user.
In this way, thenormalization model could be evolved togetherwith the social media language and chat messagecould also be personalized for each userdynamically and interactively.3.2 Personalized Normalization ModelWe employ a simple but effective approach forchat normalization.
We express normalizationusing a probabilistic model as below)|(maxarg csPssbest?and define the probability using a linearcombination of features),(exp)|(1cshcsP kmkk???

, where || ic  is the number ofic entries defined in the dictionary.
We adjust theprobability manually for some entries that are verycommon and occur more than a certain threshold,t , in the NUS SMS corpus (How and Kan, 2005)with a higher weight-age, w .
This model, togetherwith the language model, forms our baselinesystem for chat normalization.??????????????

We use standard state-of-the-art open source tools, Moses (Koehn, 2007), todevelop the system and the SRI language modelingtoolkit (Stolcke,2003) to train a trigram languagemodel on the English portion of the EuroparlCorpus (Koehn, 2005).3.3 ExperimentsWe conducted a small experiment using 134 chatmessages sent by high school students.
Out ofthese messages, 73 short-forms are uncommon andnot found in our default dictionary.
Most of these33short-forms are very irregular and hard to predicttheir standard forms using morphological andphonetic similarity.
It is also hard to train astatistical model if training data is not available.We asked the students to define their personalabbreviations in the system and run through thesystem with and without the user dictionary.
Weasked them to give a score of 1 if the output isacceptable to them as proper English, otherwise a 0will be given.
We compared the results using boththe baseline model and the model implementedusing the same training data as in Aw et al (2006).Table 1 shows the number of accepted outputbetween the two models.
Both models showimprovement with the use of user dictionary.
Italso shows that it is very critical to have similartraining data for the targeted domain to have goodnormalization performance.
A simple model helpsif such training data is unavailable.
Nevertheless,the use of a dictionary driven by the user is analternative to improve the overall performance.One reason for the inability of both models tocapture the variations fully is because manymessages require some degree of rephrasing inaddition to insertion and deletion to make itreadable and acceptable.
For example, the idealoutput for ?haiz, I wanna pontang school?
is ?Sigh,I do not feel like going to school?, which may notbe just a normalization problem.BaselineModelBaseline  +UserDictionaryAw et al(2006)Aw et al(2006) +userDictionary40 72 17 42Table 1.

Conversion between a Malay user & anEnglish user4 ConclusionsAsiaSpik system provides an architecture forperforming chat normalization for each user suchthat user can chat as usual and does not need to payspecial attention to type in proper language wheninvolving translation for multilingual chat.
Thesystem aims to overcome the limitations ofnormalizing social media content universallythrough a personalized normalization model.
Theproposed strategy makes user the active contributorin defining the chat language and enables thesystem to model the user chat languagedynamically.The normalization approach is a simpleprobabilistic model making use of thenormalization probability defined for each short-form and the language model probability.
Themodel can be further improved by fine-tuning thenormalization probability and incorporate otherfeature functions.
The baseline model can also befurther improved with more sophisticated methodwithout changing the architecture of the fullsystem.AsiaSpik is a demonstration system.
We wouldlike to expand the normalization model to includemore features and support other languages such asMalay and Chinese.
We would also like to furtherenhance the system to convert the translatedEnglish chat messages back to the social medialanguage as defined by the user.ReferencesAiTi Aw, Min Zhang, Juan Xiao, and Jian Su.
