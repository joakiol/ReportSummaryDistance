Thesecorpora define the semantic roles of predi-cates for each frame independently.
Thus,it is crucial for the machine-learning ap-proach to generalize semantic roles acrossdifferent frames, and to increase the sizeof training instances.
This paper ex-plores several criteria for generalizing se-mantic roles in FrameNet: role hierar-chy, human-understandable descriptors ofroles, semantic types of filler phrases, andmappings from FrameNet roles to the-matic roles of VerbNet.
We also pro-pose feature functions that naturally com-bine and weight these criteria, based onthe training data.
The experimental resultof the role classification shows 19.16%and 7.42% improvements in error reduc-tion rate and macro-averaged F1 score, re-spectively.
We also provide in-depth anal-yses of the proposed criteria.1 IntroductionSemantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a task of analyz-ing predicate-argument structures in texts.
Morespecifically, SRL identifies predicates and theirarguments with appropriate semantic roles.
Re-solving surface divergence of texts (e.g., voiceof verbs and nominalizations) into unified seman-tic representations, SRL has attracted much at-tention from researchers into various NLP appli-cations including question answering (Narayananand Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007;buy.v PropBank FrameNetFrame buy.01 Commerce buyRoles ARG0: buyer BuyerARG1: thing bought GoodsARG2: seller SellerARG3: paid MoneyARG4: benefactive Recipient...
...Figure 1: A comparison of frames for buy.v de-fined in PropBank and FrameNetMoschitti et al, 2007), and information extrac-tion (Surdeanu et al, 2003).In recent years, with the wide availability of cor-pora such as PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) andFrameNet (Baker et al, 1998), a number of stud-ies have presented statistical approaches to SRL(Ma`rquez et al, 2008).
Figure 1 shows an exam-ple of the frame definitions for a verb buy in Prop-Bank and FrameNet.
These corpora define a largenumber of frames and define the semantic roles foreach frame independently.
This fact is problem-atic in terms of the performance of the machine-learning approach, because these definitions pro-duce many roles that have few training instances.PropBank defines a frame for each sense ofpredicates (e.g., buy.01), and semantic roles aredefined in a frame-specific manner (e.g., buyer andseller for buy.01).
In addition, these roles are asso-ciated with tags such as ARG0-5 and AM-*, whichare commonly used in different frames.
MostSRL studies on PropBank have used these tagsin order to gather a sufficient amount of trainingdata, and to generalize semantic-role classifiersacross different frames.
However, Yi et al (2007)reported that tags ARG2?ARG5 were inconsis-tent and not that suitable as training instances.Some recent studies have addressed alternative ap-proaches to generalizing semantic roles across dif-ferent frames (Gordon and Swanson, 2007; Zapi-19Transfer::RecipientGiving::Recipient Commerce_buy::BuyerCommerce_sell::Buyer Commerce_buy::SellerCommerce_sell::SellerGiving::DonorTransfer::DonorBuyer SellerAgent role-to-role relationhierarchical classthematic rolerole descriptorRecipient DonorFigure 2: An example of role groupings using different criteria.rain et al, 2008).FrameNet designs semantic roles as frame spe-cific, but also defines hierarchical relations of se-mantic roles among frames.
Figure 2 illustratesan excerpt of the role hierarchy in FrameNet; thisfigure indicates that the Buyer role for the Com-merce buy frame (Commerce buy::Buyer here-after) and the Commerce sell::Buyer role are in-herited from the Transfer::Recipient role.
Al-though the role hierarchy was expected to gener-alize semantic roles, no positive results for roleclassification have been reported (Baldewein et al,2004).
Therefore, the generalization of semanticroles across different frames has been brought upas a critical issue for FrameNet (Gildea and Juraf-sky, 2002; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Giuglea andMoschitti, 2006)In this paper, we explore several criteria for gen-eralizing semantic roles in FrameNet.
In addi-tion to the FrameNet hierarchy, we use variouspieces of information: human-understandable de-scriptors of roles, semantic types of filler phrases,and mappings from FrameNet roles to the thematicroles of VerbNet.
We also propose feature func-tions that naturally combines these criteria in amachine-learning framework.
Using the proposedmethod, the experimental result of the role classi-fication shows 19.16% and 7.42% improvementsin error reduction rate and macro-averaged F1, re-spectively.
We provide in-depth analyses with re-spect to these criteria, and state our conclusions.2 Related WorkMoschitti et al (2005) first classified roles by us-ing four coarse-grained classes (Core Roles, Ad-juncts, Continuation Arguments and Co-referringArguments), and built a classifier for each coarse-grained class to tag PropBank ARG tags.
Eventhough the initial classifiers could perform roughestimations of semantic roles, this step was notable to solve the ambiguity problem in PropBankARG2-5.
When training a classifier for a seman-tic role, Baldewein et al (2004) re-used the train-ing instances of other roles that were similar to thetarget role.
As similarity measures, they used theFrameNet hierarchy, peripheral roles of FrameNet,and clusters constructed by a EM-based method.Gordon and Swanson (2007) proposed a general-ization method for the PropBank roles based onsyntactic similarity in frames.Many previous studies assumed that thematicroles bridged semantic roles in different frames.Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) showed that classifica-tion accuracy was improved by manually replac-ing FrameNet roles into 18 thematic roles.
Shiand Mihalcea (2005) and Giuglea and Moschitti(2006) employed VerbNet thematic roles as thetarget of mappings from the roles defined by thedifferent semantic corpora.
Using the thematicroles as alternatives of ARG tags, Loper et al(2007) and Yi et al (2007) demonstrated that theclassification accuracy of PropBank roles was im-proved for ARG2 roles, but that it was diminishedfor ARG1.
Yi et al (2007) also described thatARG2?5 were mapped to a variety of thematicroles.
Zapirain et al (2008) evaluated PropBankARG tags and VerbNet thematic roles in a state-of-the-art SRL system, and concluded that PropBankARG tags achieved a more robust generalization ofthe roles than did VerbNet thematic roles.3 Role ClassificationSRL is a complex task wherein several problemsare intertwined: frame-evoking word identifica-tion, frame disambiguation (selecting a correctframe from candidates for the evoking word), role-phrase identification (identifying phrases that fillsemantic roles), and role classification (assigningcorrect roles to the phrases).
In this paper, we fo-cus on role classification, in which the role gen-eralization is particularly critical to the machinelearning approach.In the role classification task, we are given asentence, a frame evoking word, a frame, and20member rolesCommerce_pay::BuyerIntentionall_act::AgentGiving::DonorGetting::RecipientGiving::RecipientSending::RecipientGiving::TimePlacing::TimeEvent::TimeCommerce_pay::BuyerCommerce_buy::BuyerCommerce_sell::BuyerBuyerRecipient TimeC_pay::BuyerGIVING::DonorIntentionally_ACT::AgentAvoiding::AgentEvading::EvaderEvading::EvaderAvoiding::AgentGetting::RecipientEvading::EvaderSt::Sentient St::Physical_ObjGiving::ThemePlacing::ThemeSt::State_of_affairsGiving::Reason   Evading::ReasonGiving::Means    Evading::PurposeTheme::AgentTheme::ThemeCommerce_buy::GoodsGetting::ThemeEvading:: PursuerCommerce_buy::BuyerCommerce_sell::SellerEvading::EvaderRole-descriptor groupsHierarchical-relation groups Semantic-type groupsThematic-role groupsGroup namelegendFigure 4: Examples for each type of role group.INPUT:frame = Commerce_sellcandidate   roles ={Seller, Buyer, Goods, Reason, Time, ... , Place}sentence = Can't [you] [sell Commerce_sell] [the factory] [to some other company]?OUTPUT:sentence = Can't [you Seller] [sell Commerce_sell] [the factory Goods][to some other company Buyer] ?Figure 3: An example of input and output of roleclassification.phrases that take semantic roles.
We are inter-ested in choosing the correct role from the can-didate roles for each phrase in the frame.
Figure 3shows a concrete example of input and output; thesemantic roles for the phrases are chosen from thecandidate roles: Seller, Buyer, Goods, Reason,... , and Place.4 Design of Role GroupsWe formalize the generalization of semantic rolesas the act of grouping several roles into aclass.
We define a role group as a set ofrole labels grouped by a criterion.
Figure 4shows examples of role groups; a group Giv-ing::Donor (in the hierarchical-relation groups)contains the roles Giving::Donor and Com-merce pay::Buyer.
The remainder of this sectiondescribes the grouping criteria in detail.4.1 Hierarchical relations among rolesFrameNet defines hierarchical relations amongframes (frame-to-frame relations).
Each relationis assigned one of the seven types of directionalrelationships (Inheritance, Using, Perspective on,Causative of, Inchoative of, Subframe, and Pre-cedes).
Some roles in two related frames are alsoconnected with role-to-role relations.
We assumethat this hierarchy is a promising resource for gen-eralizing the semantic roles; the idea is that therole at a node in the hierarchy inherits the char-acteristics of the roles of its ancestor nodes.
Forexample, Commerce sell::Seller in Figure 2 in-herits the property of Giving::Donor.For Inheritance, Using, Perspective on, andSubframe relations, we assume that descendantroles in these relations have the same or special-ized properties of their ancestors.
Hence, for eachrole yi, we define the following two role groups,Hchildyi = {y|y = yi ?
y is a child of yi},Hdescyi = {y|y = yi ?
y is a descendant of yi}.The hierarchical-relation groups in Figure 4 arethe illustrations of Hdescyi .For the relation types Inchoative of andCausative of, we define role groups in the oppo-site direction of the hierarchy,Hparentyi = {y|y = yi ?
y is a parent of yi},Hanceyi = {y|y = yi ?
y is an ancestor of yi}.This is because lower roles of Inchoative ofand Causative of relations represent more neu-tral stances or consequential states; for example,Killing::Victim is a parent of Death::Protagonistin the Causative of relation.Finally, the Precedes relation describes the se-quence of states and events, but does not spec-ify the direction of semantic inclusion relations.Therefore, we simply try Hchildyi , Hdescyi , Hparentyi ,and Hanceyi for this relation type.4.2 Human-understandable role descriptorFrameNet defines each role as frame-specific; inother words, the same identifier does not appearin different frames.
However, in FrameNet,human experts assign a human-understandablename to each role in a rather systematic man-ner.
Some names are shared by the roles indifferent frames, whose identifiers are dif-ferent.
Therefore, we examine the semantic21commonality of these names; we construct anequivalence class of the roles sharing the samename.
We call these human-understandablenames role descriptors.
In Figure 4, the role-descriptor group Buyer collects the roles Com-merce pay::Buyer, Commerce buy::Buyer,and Commerce sell::Buyer.This criterion may be effective in collectingsimilar roles since the descriptors have been anno-tated by intuition of human experts.
As illustratedin Figure 2, the role descriptors group the seman-tic roles which are similar to the roles that theFrameNet hierarchy connects as sister or parent-child relations.
However, role-descriptor groupscannot express the relations between the rolesas inclusions since they are equivalence classes.For example, the roles Commerce sell::Buyerand Commerce buy::Buyer are included in therole descriptor group Buyer in Figure 2; how-ever, it is difficult to merge Giving::Recipientand Commerce sell::Buyer because the Com-merce sell::Buyer has the extra property that onegives something of value in exchange and a hu-man assigns different descriptors to them.
We ex-pect that the most effective weighting of these twocriteria will be determined from the training data.4.3 Semantic type of phrasesWe consider that the selectional restriction is help-ful in detecting the semantic roles.
FrameNet pro-vides information concerning the semantic typesof role phrases (fillers); phrases that play spe-cific roles in a sentence should fulfill the se-mantic constraint from this information.
Forinstance, FrameNet specifies the constraint thatSelf motion::Area should be filled by phraseswhose semantic type is Location.
Since thesetypes suggest a coarse-grained categorization ofsemantic roles, we construct role groups that con-tain roles whose semantic types are identical.4.4 Thematic roles of VerbNetVerbNet thematic roles are 23 frame-independentsemantic categories for arguments of verbs,such as Agent, Patient, Theme and Source.These categories have been used as consis-tent labels across verbs.
We use a partialmapping between FrameNet roles and Verb-Net thematic roles provided by SemLink.
1Each group is constructed as a set Tti =1http://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/{y|SemLink maps y into the thematic role ti}.SemLink currently maps 1,726 FrameNet rolesinto VerbNet thematic roles, which are 37.61% ofroles appearing at least once in the FrameNet cor-pus.
This may diminish the effect of thematic-rolegroups than its potential.5 Role classification method5.1 Traditional approachWe are given a frame-evoking word e, a frame fand a role phrase x detected by a human or someautomatic process in a sentence s. Let Yf be theset of semantic roles that FrameNet defines as be-ing possible role assignments for the frame f , andlet x = {x1, .
.
.
, xn} be observed features for xfrom s, e and f .
The task of semantic role classifi-cation can be formalized as the problem of choos-ing the most suitable role y?
from Yf .
Suppose wehave a model P (y|f,x) which yields the condi-tional probability of the semantic role y for givenf and x.
Then we can choose y?
as follows:y?
= argmaxy?YfP (y|f,x).
(1)A traditional way to incorporate role groupsinto this formalization is to overwrite each roley in the training and test data with its rolegroup m(y) according to the memberships ofthe group.
For example, semantic roles Com-merce sell::Seller and Giving::Donor can be re-placed by their thematic-role group Theme::Agentin this approach.
We determine the most suitablerole group c?
as follows:c?
= argmaxc?{m(y)|y?Yf}Pm(c|f,x).
(2)Here, Pm(c|f,x) presents the probability of therole group c for f and x.
The role y?
is determineduniquely iff a single role y ?
Yf is associatedwith c?.
Some previous studies have employed thisidea to remedy the data sparseness problem in thetraining data (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
How-ever, we cannot apply this approach when multi-ple roles in Yf are contained in the same class.
Forexample, we can construct a semantic-type groupSt::State of affairs in which Giving::Reason andGiving::Means are included, as illustrated in Fig-ure 4.
If c?
= St::State of affairs, we cannot dis-ambiguate which original role is correct.
In ad-dition, it may be more effective to use various22groupings of roles together in the model.
For in-stance, the model could predict the correct roleCommerce sell::Seller for the phrase ?you?
inFigure 3 more confidently, if it could infer itsthematic-role group as Theme::Agent and its par-ent group Giving::Donor correctly.
Although theensemble of various groupings seems promising,we need an additional procedure to prioritize thegroupings for the case where the models for mul-tiple role groupings disagree; for example, it is un-satisfactory if two models assign the groups Giv-ing::Theme and Theme::Agent to the same phrase.5.2 Role groups as feature functionsWe thus propose another approach that incorpo-rates group information as feature functions.
Wemodel the conditional probability P (y|f,x) by us-ing the maximum entropy framework,p(y|f,x) = exp(?i ?igi(x, y))?y?Yf exp(?i ?igi(x, y)).
(3)Here, G = {gi} denotes a set of n feature func-tions, and ?
= {?i} denotes a weight vector forthe feature functions.In general, feature functions for the maximumentropy model are designed as indicator functionsfor possible pairs of xj and y.
For example, theevent where the head word of x is ?you?
(x1 = 1)and x plays the role Commerce sell::Seller in asentence is expressed by the indicator function,grole1 (x, y) =????
?1 (x1 = 1 ?y = Commerce sell::Seller)0 (otherwise).
(4)We call this kind of feature function an x-role.In order to incorporate role groups into themodel, we also include all feature functions forpossible pairs of xj and role groups.
Equation 5is an example of a feature function for instanceswhere the head word of x is ?you?
and y is in therole group Theme::Agent,gtheme2 (x, y) =????
?1 (x1 = 1 ?y ?
Theme::Agent)0 (otherwise).
(5)Thus, this feature function fires for the roles wher-ever the head word ?you?
plays Agent (e.g., Com-merce sell::Seller, Commerce buy::Buyer andGiving::Donor).
We call this kind of feature func-tion an x-group function.In this way, we obtain x-group functions forall grouping methods, e.g., gthemek , ghierarchyk .The role-group features will receive more traininginstances by collecting instances for fine-grainedroles.
Thus, semantic roles with few training in-stances are expected to receive additional cluesfrom other training instances via role-group fea-tures.
Another advantage of this approach is thatthe usefulness of the different role groups is de-termined by the training processes in terms ofweights of feature functions.
Thus, we do not needto assume that we have found the best criterion forgrouping roles; we can allow a training process tochoose the criterion.
We will discuss the contribu-tions of different groupings in the experiments.5.3 Comparison with related workBaldewein et al (2004) suggested an approachthat uses role descriptors and hierarchical rela-tions as criteria for generalizing semantic rolesin FrameNet.
They created a classifier for eachframe, additionally using training instances for therole A to train the classifier for the role B, if theroles A and B were judged as similar by a crite-rion.
This approach performs similarly to the over-writing approach, and it may obscure the differ-ences among roles.
Therefore, they only re-usedthe descriptors as a similarity measure for the roleswhose coreness was peripheral.
2In contrast, we use all kinds of role descriptorsto construct groups.
Since we use the feature func-tions for both the original roles and their groups,appropriate units for classification are determinedautomatically in the training process.6 Experiment and DiscussionWe used the training set of the Semeval-2007Shared task (Baker et al, 2007) in order to ascer-tain the contributions of role groups.
This datasetconsists of the corpus of FrameNet release 1.3(containing roughly 150,000 annotations), and anadditional full-text annotation dataset.
We ran-domly extracted 10% of the dataset for testing, andused the remainder (90%) for training.Performance was measured by micro- andmacro-averaged F1 (Chang and Zheng, 2008) withrespect to a variety of roles.
The micro average bi-ases each F1 score by the frequencies of the roles,2In FrameNet, each role is assigned one of four differenttypes of coreness (core, core-unexpressed, peripheral, extra-thematic) It represents the conceptual necessity of the rolesin the frame to which it belongs.23and the average is equal to the classification accu-racy when we calculate it with all of the roles inthe test set.
In contrast, the macro average doesnot bias the scores, thus the roles having a smallnumber of instances affect the average more thanthe micro average.6.1 Experimental settingsWe constructed a baseline classifier that usesonly the x-role features.
The feature de-sign is similar to that of the previous stud-ies (Ma`rquez et al, 2008).
The characteristicsof x are: frame, frame evoking word, headword, content word (Surdeanu et al, 2003),first/last word, head word of left/right sister,phrase type, position, voice, syntactic path (di-rected/undirected/partial), governing category(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), WordNet super-sense in the phrase, combination features offrame evoking word & headword, combinationfeatures of frame evoking word & phrase type,and combination features of voice & phrase type.We also used PoS tags and stem forms as extrafeatures of any word-features.We employed Charniak and Johnson?s rerank-ing parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) to an-alyze syntactic trees.
As an alternative for thetraditional named-entity features, we used Word-Net supersenses: 41 coarse-grained semantic cate-gories of words such as person, plant, state, event,time, location.
We used Ciaramita and Altun?s Su-per Sense Tagger (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006) totag the supersenses.
The baseline system achieved89.00% with respect to the micro-averaged F1.The x-group features were instantiated similarlyto the x-role features; the x-group features com-bined the characteristics of x with the role groupspresented in this paper.
The total number of fea-tures generated for all x-roles and x-groups was74,873,602.
The optimal weights ?
of the fea-tures were obtained by the maximum a poste-rior (MAP) estimation.
We maximized an L2-regularized log-likelihood of the training set us-ing the Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method(Nocedal, 1980).6.2 Effect of role groupsTable 1 shows the micro and macro averages of F1scores.
Each role group type improved the microaverage by 0.5 to 1.7 points.
The best result wasobtained by using all types of groups together.

Baldewein et al (2004) reportedthat hierarchical relations did not perform well fortheir method and experimental setting; however,we found that significant improvements could alsobe achieved with hierarchical relations.
We alsotried a traditional label-replacing approach withrole descriptors (in the third row of Table 1).
Thecomparison between the second and third rows in-dicates that mixing the original fine-grained rolesand the role groups does result in a more accurateclassification.By using all types of groups together, themodel reduced 19.16 % of the classification errorsfrom the baseline.
Moreover, the macro-averagedF1 scores clearly showed improvements resultingfrom using role groups.
In order to determinethe reason for the improvements, we measuredthe precision, recall, and F1-scores with respectto roles for which the number of training instanceswas at most 10, 20, and 50.
In Table 2, we showthat the micro-averaged F1 score for roles hav-ing 10 instances or less was improved (by 15.46points) when all role groups were used.
This resultsuggests the reason for the effect of role groups; bybridging similar semantic roles, they supply roleshaving a small number of instances with the infor-mation from other roles.6.3 Analyses of role descriptorsIn Table 1, the largest improvement was obtainedby the use of role descriptors.
We analyze the ef-fect of role descriptors in detail in Tables 3 and 4.Table 3 shows the micro-averaged F1 scores of all24Coreness #roles #instances/#role #groups #instances/#group #roles/#groupCore 1902 122.06 655 354.4 2.9Peripheral 1924 25.24 250 194.3 7.7Extra-thematic 763 13.90 171 62.02 4.5Table 4: The analysis of the numbers of roles, instances, and role-descriptor groups, for each type ofcoreness.Coreness MicroBaseline 89.00Core 89.51Peripheral 90.12Extra-thematic 89.09All 90.77Table 3: The effect of employing role-descriptorgroups of each type of coreness.semantic roles when we use role-descriptor groupsconstructed from each type of coreness (core3, pe-ripheral, and extra-thematic) individually.
The pe-ripheral type generated the largest improvements.Table 4 shows the number of roles associatedwith each type of coreness (#roles), the number ofinstances for the original roles (#instances/#role),the number of groups for each type of coreness(#groups), the number of instances for each group(#instances/#group), and the number of roles pereach group (#roles/#group).
In the peripheraltype, the role descriptors subdivided 1,924 distinctroles into 250 groups, each of which contained 7.7roles on average.
The peripheral type includedsemantic roles such as place, time, reason, dura-tion.
These semantic roles appear in many frames,because they have general meanings that can beshared by different frames.
Moreover, the seman-tic roles of peripheral type originally occurred inonly a small number (25.24) of training instanceson average.
Thus, we infer that the peripheraltype generated the largest improvement becausesemantic roles in this type acquired the greatestbenefit from the generalization.6.4 Hierarchical relations and relation typesWe analyzed the contributions of the FrameNet hi-erarchy for each type of role-to-role relations andfor different depths of grouping.

We ob-tained better results by using not only groups forparent roles, but also groups for all ancestors.
Thebest result was obtained by using all relations inthe hierarchy.6.5 Analyses of different grouping criteriaTable 6 reports the precision, recall, and micro-averaged F1 scores of semantic roles with respectto each coreness type.4 In general, semantic rolesof the core coreness were easily identified by allof the grouping criteria; even the baseline systemobtained an F1 score of 91.93.
For identifying se-mantic roles of the peripheral and extra-thematictypes of coreness, the simplest solution, the de-scriptor criterion, outperformed other criteria.In Table 7, we categorize feature functionswhose weights are in the top 1000 in terms ofgreatest absolute value.
The behaviors of the rolegroups can be distinguished by the following twocharacteristics.
Groups of role descriptors and se-mantic types have large weight values for the firstword and supersense features, which capture thecharacteristics of adjunctive phrases.
The originalroles and hierarchical-relation groups have strong4The figures of role descriptors in Tables 4 and 6 differ.In Table 4, we measured the performance when we used oneor all types of coreness for training.
In contrast, in Table 6,we used all types of coreness for training, but computed theperformance of semantic roles for each coreness separately.25Feature Type Pre.

Table 7 suggests that role-descriptorgroups and semantic-type groups are effective forperipheral or adjunctive roles, and hierarchical re-lation groups are effective for core roles.7 ConclusionWe have described different criteria for general-izing semantic roles in FrameNet.
They were:role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptorsof roles, semantic types of filler phrases, andmappings from FrameNet roles to thematic rolesof VerbNet.
We also proposed a feature designthat combines and weights these criteria using thetraining data.
The experimental result of the roleclassification task showed a 19.16% of the errorreduction and a 7.42% improvement in the macro-averaged F1 score.
In particular, the method wehave presented was able to classify roles havingfew instances.
We confirmed that modeling therole generalization at feature level was better thanthe conventional approach that replaces semanticrole labels.Each criterion presented in this paper improvedthe accuracy of classification.
The most success-ful criterion was the use of human-understandablerole descriptors.
Unfortunately, the FrameNet hi-erarchy did not outperform the role descriptors,contrary to our expectations.
A future directionof this study would be to analyze the weakness ofthe FrameNet hierarchy in order to discuss possi-ble improvement of the usage and annotations offeatures of x class typeor hr rl st vnframe 0 4 0 1 0evoking word 3 4 7 3 0ew & hw stem 9 34 20 8 0ew & phrase type 11 7 11 3 1head word 13 19 8 3 1hw stem 11 17 8 8 1content word 7 19 12 3 0cw stem 11 26 13 5 0cw PoS 4 5 14 15 2directed path 19 27 24 6 7undirected path 21 35 17 2 6partial path 15 18 16 13 5last word 15 18 12 3 2first word 11 23 53 26 10supersense 7 7 35 25 4position 4 6 30 9 5others 27 29 33 19 6total 188 298 313 152 50Table 7: The analysis of the top 1000 feature func-tions.
