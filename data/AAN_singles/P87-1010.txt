Constituent-Based Morphological Parsing:A New Approach to the Problem of Word-Recognition.Richard SproatLinguistics DepartmentAT&T Bell Laboratories600 Mountain AveMurray Hill, NJ 07974.Barbara Brunson*AT&T Bell LaboratoriesandDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of TorontoToronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A1.AbstractWe present a model of morphologicalprocessing which directly encodes prosodicconstituency, a notion which is clearly crucialin many widespread morphological processes.The model has been implemented for theAustralian language Warlpiri and has beensuccessfully interfaced with a syntactic parserfor that language (Brunson, 1986).
Wecontrast our approach with approaches tomorphological parsing in the KIMMOframework.1.
IntroductionThe "Two-Level" Model of morphologicalprocessing developed by Kimmo Koskenniemi(1983), henceforth KIMMO, has spawnedmuch subsequent research in the sameframework (Karttunen, 1983; inter alia).Important design features of this modelinclude a set of morpheme lexicons and a setof parallel finite state transducers whichimplement phonological rules mapping surfacestrings to lexical representations.
Not only arephonological rules finite state, but the controlstructure of the model is itself finite state.Two criticisms of this model can be put forth.First, KIMMO is not guaranteed to becomputationally efficient (Barton, 1986).Second, there are many interestingmorphological phenomena that KIMMOcannot cover without significantly redesigningthe model.
In this paper we will address thesecond point.
We will present a model ofword-structure recognition which, unlike theKIMMO model, makes heavy use of prosodicconstituent structure.
Not only is reference toprosodic constituency necessary to provide aprincipled way of dealing with certainmorphological processes, but such an approachto phonological processing is crucial for anyinterface of current parsing systems withspeech recognition systems (Church, 1983).The model has been implemented for theAustralian language Warlpiri.
We willdescribe how the parser works, and how ithandles morphological phenomena that would,at best, require inelegant mechanisms withinthe KIMMO model.
We will also show howwe can handle morphological phenomena thatare not exemplified in Warlpiri but which areof a similar ilk.2.
Two Facts about MorphologyWe will now consider two issues inmorphology, namely prosody and the non-isomorphism of syntactic and phonologicalstructure.
We maintain that these are arecentral to the task of a morphological analyzerand, hence, have incorporated them into ourmodel.2.1 The Relevance of Prosody to MorphologyIt has become increasingly evident fromresearch within Generative Linguistics that65morphology cannot be limited to theconcatenation and subsequent modification ofstrings of segments, but must recognizeprosodic constituents devoid of segmentalcontent (McCarthy, 1979; Levin, 1985).Work on reduplication I by Marantz (1982) andby Levin (1985) has argued convincingly thatreduplication involves the preftxation orsuffixation of a prosodic constituent which isempty of segmental information but whichreceives egmental specification by copying thesegmental melody from the base.Furthermore, it has been suggested thatinfLxation 2 must be viewed as prefixation orsuffixation of an affix to a prescribed prosodicsubconstitucnt of a word rather than to thewhole word.All of this work argues that prosody is a~ucial component of morphology.
It isnecessary, therefore, that morphologicalprocessing systems should have a mechanismfor dealing with prosody in a general way.K IMMO does not provide such a mechanism.Instead, it assumes that the problem ofmorphological recognition is one of matchingsome input string to a set of lexical strings.Prosodic considerations do not even enter thepicture.
The K IMMO model probably couldbe extended in various ways to cover suchphenomena, but such extensions wouldconstitute a significant change in the theory.Reduplication would require a particularlysignificant revision since it both involvesreference to prosodic structure as well as acopy mechanism which is not finite state inany interesting sense.
Note that althoughreduplication is strictly speaking bounded bythe maximal size of some well-definedprosodic unit, and hence is effectively finitestate, finite state recognition for reduplicationwould require the anticipation m i.e.,precompilation m of all possiblereduplicative-affix/stem sequences.Reduplication in natural language involvesrecognition of the language ww, a languagewhich is well known not to be regular.
As weshall see, reduplication is handled in ourmodel by directly encoding prosody, andallowing for a bounded matching mechanism.2.2 The Non.Isomorphism of Morphophonologyand MorphosyntaxAnother fundamental property of morphologyis the fact that the structure required for thephonology is not necessarily isomorphic to thestructure required for the morphosyntax.
Thispoint has been argued extensively in work suchas Marantz (1984) and Sproat (1985).
Forexample, in Warlpiri a number of clitics whichare suffixes as far as the phonology isconcerned (i.e., they undergo VowelHarmony 3 with the word to which they attach)are separate words from the point of view ofthe syntax.
For instance, the auxiliary inWarlpiri tensed clauses generally occurs as thesecond syntactic constituent of the sentence;phonologically, however, it is part of the firstconstituent.
This phenomenon is by no meanslimited to scattered examples in a fewlanguages, but apparently represents a veryimportant generalization about the interactionof phonology and syntax in the morphologythey operate over different, though relatedstructures.
We propose to capture thisobservation by making the syntactic module ofthe parser largely independent of thephonological module, as we shall outlinebelow.3.
A Description of the Warlpiri Parsing SystemThe main reason for choosing Warlpiri for ourtest domain is that Warlpiri provides asufficient number of interesting morphologicaland phonological phenomena m such asVowel Harmony and reduplication - -  withouthaving an overabundance of phonological rules(unlike Finnish which has roughly 20 rules inthe KIMMO description).
It is thus possibleto build a system which has a reasonablecoverage of the morphological andphonological processes evident in thelanguage.
At the same time, in order to coverthe Warlpiri data the system must be designedto handle morphological processes whosedescription crucially depends upon prosodicconstituency.The task of the morphophonological parser isto f'md out where the word boundaries are andthen where the morphemes are.
It receives asinput a stream of segments and a parallelstream of suprasegmental stress information.66The input streams may represent a single wordor they may represent a sequence of words; inany case, no word or morpheme boundariesare provided in the input.
The parser checksto see if a morpheme sequence can correspondto the input stream by verifying that theappropriate phonological rules apply in theappropriate domains.
It then passes a'flattened representation' of the morphologicalstructure, consisting merely of the morphemesin their linear order with word boundaries, offto the syntactic parser.The syntactic parser for Warlpiri which wehave been using is due to Brunson (1986).This parser was designed to take as input asequence of morphemes rather than a sequenceof fully formed words as most syntacticparsers do.
Such a parser embodies our beliefthat the the task of building a syntacticrepresentation for words should be handled bythe syntactic parser and not by a separatemorphosyntactic parser.
In this way clitics canreadily be identified in their syntactic rolesindependent of their phonologicalconstituency.Let us now turn to a concrete example fromWarlpiri and show how we parse themorphemes and pass on the 'flattenedrepresentation' to the syntactic parser.4.
Parsing the MorphophonologyWe will take as an example for discussion theword /pangupangurnu/, which means 'dugrepeatedly' and which is composed of themorphemes Reduplication + pangi + rnu, (pangi= 'dig', rnu --- 'past') (Nash, 1980), whereReduplication is the verbal reduplicationmorpheme.
Of interest in this example areregressive Vowel Harmony 4, and, of course,reduplication.
The input consists of the streamof segments and a stream of stressesS:pangupangu r nu1 2There is a question of course as to whetherone could reliably derive stress informationfrom connected speech input.
Preliminarystudies of Warlpiri intonation suggest thatmain word stress at least is extractable fromacoustic input (see Figure I).
We presume,however, that other phonetic facts may alsohelp determine the prosody; see Church (1983)for a method for determining English prosodicconstituents from observable allophonicvariation.The f'n'st task is to find the prosodicconstituents, i.e.
to find where the syllablesare, where the feet ~ are, and where theprosodic words are.
The particular parsingalgorithm we adopt is that of Church (1983),which is not left-to-right, but nothing hingeson this decision; indeed, as we point outbelow, we will ultimately want a left-to-rightparsing algorithm so that the phonological andsyntactic parsing can be interleaved.
Theprosody of Warlpiri is simple in that syllabletypes are limited and phonological words arereliably left-stressed.
In the particularexample, the parser will tell us that thesyllables are /pa/, /ngu/, /pa/, /ngu/ and /rnu/(the sequences ng and rn represent singlesegments), that the feet are /pangu/ and/pangurnu/ and that there is a single prosodicword, namely/pangupangurnu/.Having done the prosody, we proceed to lookup the morphemes which might plausiblycomprise the word.
Warlpiri quite generallyrequires that morphemes be syllabifiablestrings.
The only exceptions to this aresuffixes which consist of the sequence\[sonorant\] \[stop\] \[vowel\], for example theimperfective auxiliary base Ipa.
We cantherefore find all possible morphologicaldecompositions for a word by checking all\[sonorant\]\[stop\]\[vowel\] sequences and allwell-formed syllable sequences and seeing ifthe strings spanning them correspond to knownmorphemes.Lexical lookup is complicated ue to the factthat the surface string can differ from theunderlying representation of the morpheme inseveral ways.
This can come about by theapplication of phonological rules.
Weimplement lexical access in such cases byhashing on underspccified featurerepresentations.
In Warlpiri the onlycomplication of this sort involves rounding ofhigh vowels: for example, lexical /i/ maysurface as /i/ or /u/ depending upon theharmony context.
In the verb root pangi willtherefore match the input sequences /pangi/and/pangu/.67........................... ~LL\] LL\]L\] _LL~-  _ .

;68Another way in which the surfacerepresentation f a morpheme may differ fromits underlying representation is if it does notcontain any segmental information, but merelyinformation about prosodic shape.
This typeof morphology manifests itself in Warlpiri asreduplication.
Briefly, the verbal reduplicativeprefix is listed as a bimoraic foot: i.e., a footof the form CV(C)(C)V. Whenever we seesuch a constituent, we posit the existence ofverbal reduplication subject to immediateverification if it matches the phonologicalmaterial to its right.
For Warlpiri, "matches"is "string equivalent to".
For other languages,a more sophisticated notion of matching wouldbe necessary.
This would be necessary whenphonological rules apply to only one part ofthe reduplicated pair.
In/pangupangurnu/, thefirst sequence /pangu/ is a bimoraic foot, andfurthermore it matches appropriately with thesequence to its right.
Therefore we can hereposit the existence of a verbal reduplicativeaffix.Having found the possible morphemes, wehave a lattice of morphemes spanning theinput.
In the example case, we have a latticewith a unique path comprising Verbal-Reduplication, pangi, rnu.
We now wish tocheck that, from a phonological point of viewalone, the affixes can be combined in theorder given.
That is, the affix path must bewell-formed according to amorphophonological grammar for Warlpiri.We can state the morphophonologicalgrammar simply as follows (where VHDstands for 'Vowel Harmony Domain'):Word - (Prefix) VHDVHD - \[Root Suffix*\] N Vowel-HarmonyThe first rule indicates that a word consists ofan optional prefix followed by a Vowel-Harmony-Domain; the second claims that aVowel-Harmony-Domain is a string analyzableas a root followed by some number of suffixestaken together with the Vowel Harmonyprocess.
We check the application ofphonological rules, such as Vowel Harmony,by checking to see that the sequence of surfacesegments can be paired with the sequence oflexical segments in the underlying morphemesand that the surface string is well-formedaccording to the statement of the rules.
Thiswe do by a mechanism formally equivalent tothe finite state transducer mechanism of theKIMMO model.
In particular, we implementphonological rules as rejection sets(Koskenniemi, 1983), which are stated asregular expressions over the set of possiblelexical/surface segment correspondences.However, in our model, phonological rules aredefined for particular domains of applicationrather than continuously applying as in theK IMMO parser for Finnish.
For example,Warlpiri Vowel Harmony is defined to applyover the sequence consisting of a root followedby its suffixes, but not over preffLxes.
~Having established the identity of themorphemes of the word, and having furtherestablished that each potential morphologicalanalysis is well-formed from a phonologicalpoint of view m i,e, the morphemes are in theright order and the relevant phonological ruleshave applied correctly over the appropriatedomains n we then pass the morphologicalanalysis off to the syntactic parser.
Morespecifically, we pass off what we call a"flattened representation" which encodes onlythe information as to what order themorphemes occur in and where the wordboundaries are.
Arguably the syntactic parserdoes need to know where the phonologicalwords and phrases are, but the fine details ofthe phonological structure are not needed.The potential non-isomorphism betweenphonological and syntactic structure is derivedfrom the narrow bandwidth of the channelbetween the phonological and syntacticcomponents of the parser.
This non-isomorphism is illustrated when a morphemewhich is phonologically an affix is syntacticallya separate word n this is the case withcliticization.Also exemplary of the division of dutybetween the morphophonological parser andthe syntactic parser is the dual status ofsubcategorization in Warlpiri.
For example,the ergative case suffix has two forms m/rlu/and /ngku/.
Both are subcategorized to occurwith nominals, a fact that is crucial in theprojection and selection of syntacticconstituency.
The choice between /rlu/ and/ngku/, on the other hand, is conditioned bysubcategorization with respect to the prosodic69structure of the stem m/ngku/being restrictedto bimoraic stems.
This subcategorization isonly an issue for the morphophonologicalparser, and is never even visible to thesyntactic parser.In Figure 2 we give an illustration of thebehavior of the morphological and syntacticparsers on a more complicated example:Ngarrka-ngku.ka marlu marna-kurra luwa.rnungarni.nja-kurra (man-ergative-aux kangaroograss-obj shoot-past eat-infmitive-obj) 'Theman is shooting the kangaroo while it is eatinggrass.'
This example illustrates a number ofinstances of phonological and syntacticmismatch.$.
Extensions and Improvements to the CurrentWorkThe model proposed here, although designedand implemented for Warlpiri, is intended tobe a general approach to morphologicalparsing.
A number of extensions can easily bemade and a number of design improvementsare necessary.First, reduplication, as we have noted, is onlyone of the kinds of morphology which are bestdefined in terms of prosodic constituents.
Themorphology of Arabic verbs (McCarthy, 1979)is another example of this, as is infixation.While Warlpiri does not exhibit thesemorphological processes, there would be noproblem extending the parser to coverlanguages which do, since it is alreadydesigned to handle prosodically definedmorphology.Another problem which comes up in thecurrent implementation is that the ordering ofsyntactic parsing after morphological parsingfails to identify syntactically ill-formed wordsas early as possible.
To give a simple examplefrom English, the string analyz-iti-able isarguably well-formed as far as the phonologyis concerned, but is ill-formed syntacticallysince -ity attaches to adjectives, not to verbs,and .able attaches to adjectives, not to wordsending in -ity, which are themselves invariablynouns.
The current parsing system woulddiscover that such a word was well-formedphonologically, only to realize that the wordwas in fact ill-formed when the syntax wasreached.
Needless to say, the solution is tointerleave the phonological and syntacticanalyses.
Sequences like analyz.iti.able wouldthen be detected early as ill-formed.6.
SummaryTo summarize, we have built a morphologicalparsing system for Warlpiri which directlyencodes prosodic notions and which alsoencodes the kind of non-isomorphy betweenphonological and syntactic representationsexhibited in natural languages.
We haveargued that it is necessary for any generaltheory of morphological processing to encodethese notions.
We view the parsing system asa partial but general theory of morphologicalprocessing, and the work we have done onWarlpiri as a particular instantiation of thisgeneral model.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Mary Laughren andKen Hale for their advice on Warlpiri.Notes* This work was partially supported by theSocial Sciences and Humanities ResearchCouncil of Canada.\[1\] Reduplication is a word formation processinvolving the repetition of a word or a part ofa word.
As an example, in Warlpiri there is aprocess of nominal reduplication to form theplural: kurdu 'child' m kurdukurdu 'children'.\[2\] Inf'txation, like prefixation and suffixation,involves the attachment of an affix to a word;but, unlike these other two processes, aninfixed affix occurs within the word ratherthan at the edge of the word.\[3\] Vowel Harmony is a phonological processin which the vowels within a certain domain(usually a word) must agree in some set offeatures.\[4\] The / i /o f  the verb stem is changed due tothe following/u/ of the past tense morpheme.This contrasts with /pangipangirni/ 'dig70Figure 2PH*WORD Pfl-Wl~lOSTRATUM 1 PH-WOI~ PH-WORD STRA~IM 1STRATUM 1 PH-WORD STRATUM 1 STRATUM 1 STRAllJM 1STRATUM t STRATUM 1 SlltA~JM I STRATUM 1 STRATUM 1F~i  5UF7 2-1mOS*AUK NOOT ROOT ~ illoolr-v2 V2-SUFT'R ROOT-V6 ~UFT~o6rkaokukaml  lum~oakur i lOusO ig~o i  n jakura(a)N, BdLN,MWG:J:r4 HG1'17 al8 g~ T{P-J~IR~ MA~.n  a l l  P~ M AJLIf d all ~UA ~ l iB!
