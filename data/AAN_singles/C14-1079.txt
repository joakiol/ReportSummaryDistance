Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,pages 827?836, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Identifying Emotional and Informational Support in Online HealthCommunitiesPrakhar Biyani1Cornelia Caragea2Prasenjit Mitra1John Yen1(1) College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, USA(2) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, USApxb5080@ist.psu.edu, ccaragea@unt.edu, {pmitra,jyen}@ist.psu.eduAbstractA large number of online health communities exist today, helping millions of people with socialsupport during difficult phases of their lives when they suffer from serious diseases.
Interactionsbetween members in these communities contain discussions on practical problems faced by peo-ple during their illness such as depression, side-effects of medications, etc and answers to thoseproblems provided by other members.
Analyzing these interactions can be helpful in gettingcrucial information about the community such as dominant health issues, identifying sentimentaleffects of interactions on individual members and identifying influential members.
In this paper,we analyze user messages of an online cancer support community, Cancer Survivors Network(CSN), to identity the two types of social support present in them: emotional support and infor-mational support.
We model the task as a binary classification problem.
We use several genericand novel domain-specific features.
Experimental results show that we achieve high classifica-tion performance.
We, then, use the classifier to predict the type of support in CSN messagesand analyze the posting behaviors of regular members and influential members in CSN in termsof the type of support they provide in their messages.
We find that influential members generallyprovide more emotional support as compared to regular members in CSN.1 IntroductionIncreasingly more people turn to online health communities (OHCs) to seek social support during theirillnesses (LaCoursiere, 2001; Beaudoin and Tao, 2007).
When people suffering from a serious diseasesuch as cancer or AIDS interact with other people who have experienced similar medical conditions,they feel emotionally supported.
In addition, through these interactions, people can obtain importantinformation about the disease, e.g., about various medications, symptoms, and side-effects.
Althoughauthoritative health-related web sites contain the information they search for, obtaining this informationdirectly from people in OHCs adds substantial value to it.
Previous studies showed that obtaining socialsupport in OHCs can help people feel better (Dunkel-Schetter, 1984; Maloney-Krichmar and Preece,2005; Beaudoin and Tao, 2007; Vilhauer, 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).As a result of online interactions in OHCs, a huge volume of user-generated content exists todayon various issues/problems related to specific diseases.
This content comprises of important informationsuch as people?s experiences with diseases, recommendations and feedbacks about certain medications ormedical procedures, and emotional support in the form of encouragement, sympathy, and success stories.Mining this content can prove to be very useful in obtaining crucial insights into community dynamicssuch as identifying dominant health issues or the effects of social support on community members,identifying influential members, as well as designing smart information retrieval systems for users.In this study, we focus on an online cancer support community, the Cancer Survivors Network1(CSN)of the American Cancer Society.
We analyze user messages of CSN to identify the two most importanttypes of social support present in them: informational and emotional support (Davison et al., 2000).Emotional support comprises of seeking or providing caring/concern, understanding, empathy, sympathy,This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In contrast, informational support comprises of seeking orproviding knowledge such as advice, referrals, and suggestions (Bambina, 2007).
We further explore therelation between the type of support present in messages and users?
influence in the community.Identifying the type of support in user messages in an OHC can potentially be used in many importantapplications including the following:1.
Identify influential members in OHCs: Every community has a set of members who influence(a much larger set of) other members in the community.
These members are called leaders orinfluential members.
The attributes of a leader in a community depends upon the community?snature (QA, Twitter, OHC, forum, blogsite, etc.).
For example, high activity may not be an indicatorof high influence in the blogosphere (Agarwal et al., 2008) and high popularity does not necessarilyimply influence in Twitter (Romero et al., 2011).
In OHCs, bringing positivity in the community andanswering members?
concerns effectively by posting messages that contain certain type of support(informational or emotional) may be an indicator of influence.2.
Improve information search in OHCs: Interactions in OHCs contain valuable information in theform of people?s experiences, advice, referrals, pertaining to diseases, medications, side-effects,etc.
Users embed this information often in messages containing other types of support, of whichemotional support constitutes a major part.
To efficiently search OHCs for this information, it mustbe separated from emotional support.
Hence, identifying the type of support in user messages canhelp improve search and retrieval in OHCs.3.
Understand social relationships in OHCs: Emotional support is one of the dimensions of socialtie strength between members in a social network (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009).
Previous stud-ies have shown that members receiving emotional support in OHCs are more likely to remain inthe community for a longer period of time as compared to members receiving informational sup-port (Wang et al., 2012).
Identifying emotional and informational support can help understand thesocial dynamics of an OHC.
For example, it would be interesting to see if there is a correlationbetween the social tie strength of members and the type of support present in their interactions.Hi X, I had a bilateral with radical on the right and prophylactic on the left.
I think all you can do isgentle exercises to strengthen your back (yoga).
There are also herbal painkillers that work well too.I just tolerate the pain and consider it a signal of my new limit and go down to rest.
You want to talk,anytime!
We are all there with you.Table 1: A user message.
Sentences in grey and black fonts are informational and emotional, respectively.We model the task of identifying the two types of supports as a binary classification problem.
Specifi-cally, we classify each sentence in a user message as containing either emotional or informational sup-port2.
Table 1 shows a user message containing emotional and informational supports.
We use severalfeatures computed from sentences of messages such as unigrams, part-of-speech tags, lexicon-based fea-tures and word patterns for the classification.
After building the classification model, we predict theamounts of the two supports in all CSN messages and explore the following research question:RQ: Do influential members of CSN post one of the two types of supports significantly morecompared to regular members?We analyze messages posted by regular members and messages posted by certain members, identifiedas influential by the CSN community managers and two staff members who monitor the contents of theCSN on a full time basis, for the type of support (informational and emotional) present in them.
Usingthe classification model, we calculate the amounts of the two supports posted by influential members andregular members and compare them across the two populations (For details, see Section 3.1).Previous works on analyzing social support in OHCs have mainly been in the field of social sci-ence (Eriksson and Lauri, 2000; Rodgers and Chen, 2005; H?ybye et al., 2005; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007;Beaudoin and Tao, 2007; Buis, 2008; Han et al., 2011).
These works used manual techniques for iden-tifying the type of support in user messages and hence, are limited to a small number of messages as2Although a sentence may belong to both the classes, we did not find such cases in our data.828compared to the real world data.
In contrast, the current work builds machine learning classifiers thatcan automatically predict the type of support in messages.
Also, to the best of our knowledge, there havebeen no reported works on analyzing the relationship between users?
influence and the type of supportpresent in their messages in OHCs.
Next, we review related works.2 Related WorkMany studies in social science have focused on analyzing social support in user messages of OHCs (Cour-saris and Liu, 2009; Han et al., 2011; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007), finding impacts of social support onusers (Eriksson and Lauri, 2000; Rodgers and Chen, 2005; Buis, 2008; H?ybye et al., 2005), identifyinginformation needs of users in OHCs (Rozmovits and Ziebland, 2004), etc.
Among various types of socialsupports, emotional support and informational support have received major attention.
In this section, wefirst review social science works on analyzing online social support, discuss works on identifying thetype of social support, and, finally, compare the current problem with subjectivity analysis.LaCoursiere (2001) presented an integrated theory conceptualizing online social support.
She definedthree channels through which online social support occurs: 1) perceptual: individual feeling the need ofsocial support arising due to emotional states such as stress, etc, 2) cognitive: individual seeking infor-mation about certain medical entities such as procedures, medication, etc, 3) transactional: individualevaluating the received social support.
In our case, these channels correspond to emotional support andinformational support.
H?ybye et al.
(2005) conducted a qualitative study to analyze the effects of onlinesocial support by interviewing women with breast cancer who used an online support group and foundthat the women were empowered by the exchanges of knowledge and experience within the online sup-port group.
Rodgers et al.
(2005) conducted a longitudinal content analysis of messages of participantsin a breast cancer discussion board to analyze changes in affect/sentiment of the participants towardsbreast cancer and found that a positive shift in sentiment occurred over the period of time.
Pfeil andZaphiris (2007) analyzed messages of SeniorNet forum to extract language patterns used to provide em-pathic support.
Budak and Agrawal (2013) interviewed participants of group chats in Twitter and foundthat informational support is more important than emotional support in educational Twitter chats.All the above works used manual methods of data preparation such as interviews with users of sup-port groups, manual coding of messages to identify emotional and informational support and performedfurther qualitative and/or quantitative analyses based on that data.
Since, manual methods have seri-ous limitations in terms of scalability, the number of messages used for analysis in these studies is toosmall compared to the real world data which contains millions of messages.
To address these limitations,we develop automatic methods for identifying the type of support in user messages in an online cancersupport group using machine learning.
We develop a classifier that learns on a smaller set of manuallylabeled messages and makes predictions on a much larger set of messages with a very high accuracy.A recent work by Wang et al.
(2012) is close to our work.
They used a linear regression model topredict the amount of informational and emotional supports present in messages of a cancer forum.
Fora test message, the trained model predicts the amount of the two supports on a scale of 1 ?
7.
Since amessage may contain both types of support, it is generally difficult for human annotators to assess theamount of each support in an entire message on a particular scale for model training.
In contrast, we labeleach sentence as belonging to either informational or emotional support class and identify the two typesof support at sentence level in messages (using binary classification).
Note that it is much easier and lessambiguous for a human annotator to identify the type of support present in a sentence (of a message)compared to giving a score to an entire message based on the amount of the two supports present in it.Relationship with Subjectivity Analysis: Subjectivity analysis is an active area of research in com-putational linguistics.
It essentially deals with separating subjective parts (e.g., expressing opinion, emo-tion, speculation and other private states of mind) from objective parts (presenting facts, verifiable infor-mation) of a text (Wiebe et al., 1999; Biyani et al., 2012a).
It has been widely used in applications likeopinion mining from product reviews (Liu, 2010), community question-answering (Li et al., 2008a; Stoy-anov et al., 2005a; Somasundaran et al., 2007), summarization (Carenini et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2005),and finding opinionative threads in online forums (Biyani et al., 2014; Biyani et al., 2012b; Biyani et al.,2013a).
Though the current work has some relation with subjectivity analysis in the sense that both are829text classification, there are important differences between the two problems.
The two classes in sub-jectivity analysis (subjective and objective) are different from the two types of support that we identify.While emotional support is subjective in nature, informational support is not necessarily objective as italso contains opinions of users.
Also, social support in OHCs encompasses several types of supportssuch as understanding, caring, concern, sympathy, empathy, knowledge about medications, etc.
whichare generally not provided by users in other sites such as product reviews, question-answering sites, etc.These differences make the two problems different in both the nature and the approaches that can be usedto address them.
For example, we use certain word patterns to identify sympathy and affirmation and usethe presence of terms related to cancer medications, procedures and side-effects for computing featuresfor classification.
These features have not been used in subjectivity classification.3 Problem FormulationOnline health communities provide social support to its members of which emotional and informationalsupports constitute a major part and have received major attention as compared to other supports suchas companionship, community building, network support, etc.
(Bambina, 2007; Meier et al., 2007;Himle et al., 1991; Wang et al., 2012; Pfeil and Zaphiris, 2007).
We focus on the two supports andfollow their definitions as given by Bambina (2007) in their study of social supports expressed in a can-cer support group.
They define emotional messages as the messages that have the following supports:caring/concern, understanding, empathy, sympathy, encouragement, affirmation and validation.
Infor-mational support is defined as providing advice, knowledge and referrals.
Since a user message oftencontains a mixture of these supports, we identify the two supports at sentence level.
Table 1 contains auser message with sentences marked with the type of support in them.
Specifically, given a sentence s,in a user message, we want to classify it into one of the two classes: emotional support or informationalsupport.
We use machine learning methods for classification.
After training the classifier, we use it topredict the type of support in the sentences of user messages in CSN and address our research questionoutlined in Section 1.
We present the details of the features used for classification in Section 3.2.3.1 Research QuestionTo address the research question (RQ), we need to compute the amounts of the two supports in themessages of regular and influential members and then compare the two amounts.
Let u denote a user andM be the set of messages posted by her such that M = {m1,m2, ....mp} where p is the total numberof messages in the set M .
For a message mk?
M , we compute its emotional index, euk= nek/(nk)where nekand nkare the number of sentences containing emotional support and the total number ofsentences in mk.
Since a sentence can belong to either emotional support or informational support class,informational index of mk, iuk= 1 ?
euk.
The overall emotional index of u (eu) is the average of theemotional indices of her messages: eu=1p?pk=1euk.
The informational index of u, iu= 1 ?
eu.Since, the informational index can be derived from emotional index, we compute only emotional indicesfor all regular and influential members and compare them between the two user populations (regularand influential).
We compute the emotional indices of regular members, ER, and emotional indices ofinfluential members, EI.
We compare the means of the two populations of emotional indices (?Reand?Ie) and test the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternate hypothesis (H1) as follows:H0: The two populations have equal means, i.e., ?Re?
?Ie= 0.H1: The two populations have significantly different means , i.e., ?Re?
?Ie6= 0.For one of the population indices to be significantly more than the other, we should have the nullhypothesis rejected.
We use one-sided t-test to conduct hypothesis testing and report the results in Sec-tion 4.5.
Next, we discuss the features used in the classification.3.2 Features for Classification3.2.1 Words and POS tagsWords and their part-of-speech tags capture basic lexical properties of text and have been extensivelyused in text classification problems such as subjectivity classification and sentiment classification (Li etal., 2008b; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Biyani et al., 2013b).
We use frequency of words and theirPOS tags in a sentence as features in our classification model.8303.2.2 Lexicon-based FeaturesEmotional support expresses caring, concern, sympathy, and other kinds of sentimental support whereasinformational support provides knowledge about cancer medications, cancer reports, referrals, and otherkinds of information (Bambina, 2007).
Due to this difference in the nature of these supports, a sentenceexpressing emotional support is likely to contain emotional words which are subjective in nature and asentence containing informational support is likely to have cancer-related keywords such as drug names,names of cancer procedures, etc.
To capture this difference, we use frequencies of subjective words andcancer-related keywords as features.
Specifically, we design five features to code frequencies of weaksubjective words (numWeak), strong subjective words (numStrong), cancer drugs (numDrug), side-effects of cancer medications (numSide), and cancer procedures (numProc) respectively in a sentence.We use the subjectivity lexicon compiled from the MPQA corpus (Stoyanov et al., 2005b) to get weakand strong subjective words.
We compile lexicon of cancer drugs3, and CSN staff members helped geta list of side-effects and cancer procedures.
Some of the side-effects of cancer medications are hair loss,neuropathy, fatigue, fibrosis, etc.3.2.3 Linguistic FeaturesWe analyzed user messages to find patterns that are expressive of emotional and informational support.We found that members, generally, use certain word patterns to express similar feelings.
For example,to provide affirmation and sympathy, people use positive verbs such as know, feel, understand, sense,support, etc.
in patterns <I $posVerb> and <I $aux $posVerb>, where $posVerb is a positive verb and$aux is an auxiliary verb from the set {can, could, do, would, will, may}.
Some people use ?We?
insteadof ?I?
in their messages to provide support such as ?we understand what you are going through?.To take into account such cases, we use the same patterns by replacing ?I ?
with ?We?.
Hence, weget four patterns for emotional support.
For providing informational support, people often use patternssuch as <You $advice>, <I $opinion>, <I $aux $opinion> to provide advice and opinions.
$adviceis an auxilliary verb from the set {should, must, need, might}, $opinion is an opinion verb from theset {recommend, advise, suggest, advocate, request}, and $aux is an auxilliary verb.
People also giveinformation about their experiences using patterns such as <I too>, <I also> and <I $pastVerb> totell their own experiences related to similar problems as that of the support seeker where $pastVerb is apast tense verb such as underwent, undergone, experienced, had, found, etc.
So, we get six patterns forinformational support.
We design two features (IsEmPattern and IsInPattern) to encode presence (1)or absence (0) of the two types of patterns.For a sentence, we also use its number of words (numWords) and its type, question sentence (IsQues)and/or exclamatory sentence (isExclaim), as features.
To identify question sentences, we see if a sen-tence starts with any of the 5W1H words (what, why, who, when, where, how) or words in the set {do,does, did} or ends with a question mark.4 ExperimentsWe now describe our data and the experimental setting, and present our results.4.1 Data PreparationWe use data from a popular online cancer support community, the Cancer Survivors?
Network (CSN),developed and maintained by the American Cancer Society.
CSN is an online community for cancerpatients, cancer survivors, their families and friends.
Its features are similar to many online forumswith dynamic interactive medium such as chat rooms, discussion boards, etc.
Members of CSN postin discussion boards for seeking and sharing information about cancer related issues and for seekingand providing emotional support.
To conduct our experiments, we used user messages in the discussionthreads of the Breast Cancer sub forum of CSN that were posted between June 2000 to June 2012.
Breastcancer is the largest among all the sub-forums of CSN.
A dataset of 250, 868 messages posted by 5516users in 22, 297 discussion threads is used in this study.To prepare the evaluation dataset for classification experiments, we randomly sampled 240 messagesfrom 27 discussion threads.
Since, our focus is on the messages that provide support, we do not consider3http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/alphalist831messages posted by thread starters in discussion threads as they seek support.
We took help of threehuman annotators to tag all the sentences of all the messages in one of the two support classes.
First,two annotators tagged all the sentences.
The percentage agreement between them was 89%.
For theremaining 11% sentences, majority vote was taken with the help of the third annotator.
Following thistagging scheme, we obtained a total of 1066 sentences with 390 sentences in the informational supportclass and 676 sentences in the emotional support class.
In many cases, members only write a few words,e.g., see you, bye, or their names at the end of a message.
To deal with these situations, we filter outsentences that have less than four words.4.2 Experimental ProtocolWe experimented with various machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines,Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting, etc.)
to conduct our classification experiments.
Naive BayesMultinomial gave the best performance with words & POS tags features, logistic regression with lexicon-based features and AdaBoost (with Decision Stump as the weak learner) with linguistic features.
Forcombining the models built on the three types of features, we used the following three methods:1.
Feature combination: Classification model built on the feature set generated by combining thethree types of features.
It is denoted by All.
We use Multinomial Naive Bayes for this model.2.
Average confidence: Ensemble of the three classifiers built on the three types of features respec-tively.
The final confidence of the ensemble is calculated by taking average of the confidencesoutputted by the three classifiers.
It is denoted by AllAvgConf.3.
Highest confidence: Similar to the AllAvgConf model but the final prediction of the ensemble istaken as the prediction of the most confident classifier of the three classifiers.
More precisely, theprediction for an instance is given by the classifier that returns the maximum prediction confidencefor one class or the other.
It is denoted by AllMostConf.Model Precision Recall F-1Emotional support classWords & POS tags 0.855 0.858 0.857Lexicon-based features 0.722 0.836 0.775Linguistic features 0.698 0.837 0.761All 0.862 0.861 0.862AllAvgConf 0.848 0.893 0.87AllMostConf 0.851 0.911 0.88Informational support classWords & POS tags 0.753 0.749 0.751Lexicon-based features 0.608 0.441 0.511Linguistic features 0.569 0.372 0.45All 0.76 0.762 0.761AllAvgConf 0.797 0.723 0.758AllMostConf 0.825 0.723 0.77OverallWords & POS tags 0.818 0.818 0.818Lexicon-based features 0.68 0.691 0.678Linguistic features 0.651 0.667 0.647All 0.825 0.825 0.825AllAvgConf 0.829 0.830 0.83AllMostConf 0.841 0.842 0.84Table 2: Classification results.We used Weka data mining toolkit (Hall et al.,2009) to conduct classification experiments.
Toevaluate the performance of our classifiers, weused macro-averaged precision, recall and F-1score.
We use F-1 score to compare perfor-mances of two classifiers and used 10-fold crossvalidation.
A naive baseline that classifies allthe instances in the majority class will have amacro-averaged precision, recall and F-1 scoreof 0.402, 0.634 and 0.492, respectively.4.3 Classification ResultsTable 2 presents the results of the support clas-sification experiments.
The table reports preci-sion, recall and F-1 score of different classifi-cation models for the individual classes and theoverall result.
Words & POS tags are the bestperforming features followed by lexicon-basedfeatures and linguistic features.
Further, com-bining all the features (model denoted as ?All?
)improves the performance over individual fea-ture types for both classes.
We see that All-MostConf model is the best performing of allthe models, particularly outperforming All andAllAvgConf models.
This observation suggests that the three classifiers built on the three features typeshave different knowledge.
For some instances, a particular classifier is more confident than the rest whilefor other instances, other classifiers are more confident.
Hence, we see that taking prediction of the most832confident classifier gives the best performance.
It is interesting to note that combining the three classi-fiers?
knowledge in this fashion is more effective than simply combining all the three types of featuresand train a single classifier on the combined feature set.
We also note that all the models have betterperformance for the emotional support class than for the informational support class.
This can be causedby the fact that there are significantly more number of instances in the former class and, hence, morepatterns to learn for the class.4.4 Informative FeaturesNext, we study the importance of individual features by measuring their chi-squared statistic with respectto the class variable.
We, first, study the word features and then present rankings of the other types offeatures.
Figure 1 shows a cloud of top 26 most informative words.
The size of a word is proportional toits chi-squared statistic, i.e., bigger a word, more informative it is.
We see that cancer specific keywordssuch as herceptin, tamoxifen, chemo, dose, stage, etc and words conveying emotions such as good, hope,glad, pain, hugs, etc are highly informative for the support classification.
Since, chi-square methodgives feature ranking for the class variable and not for individual classes, we compute word rankings forindividual classes using tf ?
idf scores of words.
Specifically, for a term t and a class c, we computethe term frequency of t by counting its number of occurrences in the instances (sentences) belongingto c and multiply the term frequency with the inverse document frequency of t (calculated from theentire corpus) to get the tf ?
idf score of t for c. Using this method, we calculated tf ?
idf scoresfor all the words and ranked them according to their scores for the two classes.
Figure 2 shows top tentf?
idf ranked keywords for the two classes.
We see that cancer-related keywords and words expressingemotions are among the top ten most informative words for the informational and the emotional supportclasses respectively.
We also note that most of the top ten words for the two classes in Figure 2 are inthe word cloud of the top 26 words computed using chi-squared method except ?keep?
for the emotionalsupport class and ?after?, ?first?, ?because?
and ?cancer?
for the informational class.
These words havesemantic relationships with the classes.
For example, ?keep?
is often used by support providers in phrasessuch as ?keep you in prayers?, ?may god keep you in good health?, etc to provide emotional support and?after?
and ?first?
are used in the context of providing one?s own experience related to cancer procedures,medications, etc such as ?After my first chemo, I did not feel light?.Figure 1: Top 26 words ranked by Chi-squaredtest.Emotional support Informational supportgood chemoknow afterglad radiationnews firsthope herceptinkeep treatmentprayers tamoxifenluck cancerhugs becausebetter painFigure 2: Top ten words for the two classesranked using tf-idf scheme.We, now, discuss the ranking of non-word features: POS tags, lexicon-based and linguistic features.The chi-squared ranking for the lexicon-based and linguistic features is as follows: numStrong > num-Words > isExclaim > numDrug > numSide > numProc > isInPattern > isEmPattern > numWeak >isQues.
The features on the right side of > have higher rank than those on the left side.
We see that thenumber of strong subjective words in a sentence is the most informative feature followed by number ofwords in a sentence.
Among cancer-related terms, drug names are more informative than side-effectsand cancer procedures.
Also, informational support word patterns are more informative than word pat-terns capturing emotional support.
It is interesting to note that isQues is the least informative feature,maybe due to the fact that, while providing support, people generally do not ask questions.
The top 5833most informative POS tags are: cardinal number (CD) followed by singular noun (NN), participle verb(VBN), past tense verb (VBD) and preposition (IN).4.5 Influence versus Support typeFigure 3: Plot showing the change in mean emo-tional indices of influential members (pink) and reg-ular members (blue) with the threshold on the num-ber of messages posted by them.CSN managers provided a list of 62 influentialmembers (IMs) for the breast cancer forum.
IMsposted a total of 340, 147 sentences in 85, 244messages and regular members posted 825, 651sentences in 165, 624 messages in the breastcancer forum.
As described in Section 3, weconduct statistical hypothesis testing on the twopopulations of emotional indices (regular mem-bers and IMs) to understand if there is a sig-nificant difference in their posting behaviors interms of providing one of the two supports moreoften than the other.
To test our hypothesis, weconducted one sided t-test on the two popula-tions.
We found that the mean of emotional in-dices of IMs (0.713) is significantly larger thanthat of the regular members (0.542).
We alsonote that the posting behavior of regular mem-bers in CSN follows a power law distribution with most of the members posting very few messages(mode = 1, median = 2, mean = 30) and only a few members posting very many messages.
To verifythat this behavior does not have impacts on our hypothesis testing, we conducted three more t-tests be-tween the two populations using a threshold on the number of messages that a member has posted.
Weused three threshold values on the number of messages: 1, 2, and 30 (as mode, median and mean values).For all the three t-tests, the null hypothesis was rejected at p-value< 0.001, suggesting that IMs postedsignificantly more emotional support than regular members.
The values of Mean Emotional Indices cor-responding to the three thresholds are 0.715, 0.719 and 0.746 for influential members and 0.564, 0.581and 0.646 for regular members respectively.In our analysis, we observed an interesting behavior.
As we increased the threshold, the mean ofemotional indices also increased.
To further investigate this finding, we plotted the means of emotionalindices of regular members and IMs as the function of the threshold on the number of messages postedby them.
We increased the threshold from 10 to 1000 in steps of 10.
Figure 3 reports the finding.
We seethat the mean of emotional indices of regular members increase with the threshold suggesting that moreactive members post more emotional support as compared to the less active members.
We also see thatthe mean of emotional indices of IMs is higher than that of regular members for all the thresholds.
Theseinteresting observations can be helpful in analyzing behavior of influential members in OHCs.5 AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Iulia Bivolaru for her help with data preparation.

0845487.6 Conclusion and Future WorkWe identified two types of social support, emotional and informational, provided in user messages of anonline cancer support community using machine learning classification models.
We used three types offeatures and got the best results by using ensemble of the three classifiers built on the three individualfeature types.
Our models achieved strong results with over 80% F-1 score.
We also found that influ-ential members provide significantly more emotional support to the community as compared to regularmembers.
The finding can be helpful in identifying properties of influential members in online healthcommunities.
