(1998) for alt;ernative proposals).In this paper, we introduce, a two-layered inter-pretation model.
In a first; pass, dependency graphstructures which result fl'om in(:remental parsing areimmediately submitted to a semantic intcrl)reta-tion process.
Such a process is triggered by gen-eral schemata whenever a semantically interl)retablesubgraph of a syntactic dependency gral)h t)ecomesava.ilable (el.
Section 3).
As a result, lexical itemsand the del)endency relations holding 1)etwe.en themare directly mat)ped to associated concel)tual enti-ties mid relations at; the level of semantic represen-tation (cf.
Sections 4 mtd 5).
In a subsequent steI),the (quasi-inferential) iml)lications of the knowledgerepresentation structures emerging from the seman-tic interpretation stet) are accounted for l)y a pro-eess we here refer to as concepl, 'aal interpretation.The (:orresl)onding ot)erations relate to the (:(mcel)-tua\] representation level only and are triggered bya variety of production rules rooted in ontologicalcategories in order to generate a canonical concep-tual representation f the parsed sentence (el.
Sec-tion 6).
This second level of interpretation is usuallynot taken into consideration by computational mod-els of semantic interpretation, either constituency-based nor (lei)endency-based ones, although it turnsout to crucial for natural anguage ',,ndeTwtandin.q.2 Grammar  and Concept KnowledgeGrammatical knowledge for syntactic analysis ist)ased on a fully texicalized dependency gl'alllltla\](Itahn et al, 1994).

Inher -i tance  of grammar knowledge is based on the ideathat constraints are attached to the most generallexeme classes to which they apply, leaving room formore and more specific (possibly, even idiosyncratic)specifications when one descends this hierarchy.A dependency grammar captures binary con-straints between a syntactic head (e.g., a noun) andone of its possible modifiers (e.g., a determiner oran adjective).

Allen (1993)).
Link-ing lexical items and concet)tual entities proceedsas follows: Upon entering the parsing process, eachlexical itern w that has a (:onceptual correlate C inthe domain knowledge base, w.C E Y (mostly verbs,Ilouns and adjectives), gets immediately instantiatedin the knowledge base, such that for any instance Iw,initially, 2 type(I,,) = w.C holds (e.g., w = :'Fest-platte", I,,, = HAI{D-Dlst,:.2, w.C = type(HaI~.D-DISK.2) = HARD-DISK).

For such a "nfinimal" sut)grat)h, semantic in-tert)retal;ion is made dependent on lexical informa-tion from the, intervening nodes, as well as knowledgeaboul; the conceptual correlates and del)cn(lency i'e-lations.

In Figure 2, e.g.,the tuples ( "Fcstplattc.

Semanticinterpretation implies a search in the knowledge basewhich takes the constraints into account that de-rive fl'om a particular dependency parse tree.
Twosorts of knowledge then lmve to be combined - -  first,a pair of concepts for which a connecting relationpath has to be determined; second, conceptual COl>straints on permitted and excluded conceptual rela-tions when connected relations are being computed.The first constraint ype ineorporates the contentwords linked by the semantically interpretable sub-graph, the latter accounts for the pm'ticular depen-dency relation(s) holding between them.

Dueto potential conceptual ambiguities in interpretingsyntactic relations, more than one such path mayexist (hence, we mat) to the power set of 12~o,~).
Inorder to constrain connectivity, si takes into con-sideration all conceptual relations 12+ C Td a prioripermitted for semantic interpretation, as well as allrelations R_ C 7~ a priori excluded.
Both of them re-flect the constraints set 11 t) by particular (lel)endencyrelations or non-content words figuring as lexical re-lators of content words.
Thus, tel G R~o,, holds, iftel is a connected relation path from Cf,.o,,~ to Cto,obeying the restrictions imposed by 12+ and 12_.If the fllnction si returns the empty set (i.e., novalid interpretation can be comtmted), no depen-dency relation will be estat)lished.
Otherwise, tbrall resulting relation paths RELi E I~con an asser-tional axiom of tile form (h.Cfro,n I~.ELi m.Cto) isadded to the knowledge base, where RELi denotestile i th reading.
If i > 1, conceptual ambiguities oc-cur, resolution strategies for which m'e described illRomaclmr and Hahn (2000a).To match a concept definition C against ile con-straints imposed by 12+ and 12_, we define the func-tion get-roles(C) =: CR, where C12 denotes the setof conceptual roles associated with C, which are thenused as starting points for the path search.
For easeand generality of st)ecification , R+ and li~_ consist ofthe most general conceptual relations only.
Hence,the concrete conceptual roles CR and the generalones in R+ and R_ may not always be compatible.So prior to semantic interpretation, we expand I2+and R_ into their transitive closures, incort)oratingall their subrelations in the relation hierarchy.
Thus,12; :-- { ,.

R*_ iscorrespondingly defined.
12+ restricts the search torelations contained in C12 rq 12"4-, iffR+ is not empty(otherwise, all elements of C12 are allowed), whereas12_ allows only for relations in C12 \ 12"_.5 A Sample  Semant ic  In terpretat ionWhenever a semantically interpretable subgraph iscomplete, selnantic interpretation gets started inl-mediately.
As an example, we will consider a case ofindirect linkage, as illustrated by the occurrence ofauxiliary and modal verbs within a passive clause.When interpreting indirect syntactic relations, in-fl)rmation not only about content word nodes butalso about intervening noncontent word nodes be-comes available.
This way, further static constraintsare imposed on R+ (and 12_) in terms of a list RI~.~.C T~.
of permitted conceptual relations.
This infor-mation is always specified at the lexcme level.
Since12t~:~ relates to closed-class i|;ems only, the requirednmnber of specifications i easy to survey.In our example (ef.
Figure 2), the content words"Festplatte" (h, ard disk) and "flcliefcrt" (dclivered)are linked by a mediating modal verb ("lvann" (can))and a passive auxiliary (%;erden" (bq ..... i,,c)).

consumerproduct test reports and medical finding reports.For evaluation purposes, we concentrated on the in-terpretation of genitives (as an instance of directlinkage) and on the interpreta.tion of t)eriphrasticverbal complexes, i.e., passive, temporal and modalconstructions (as instances of indirect linkage).The underlying ontology consists of an uppergeneric part (containing about 1,500 concepts andrelations) and domain-specific extensions relating toinformation technology (IT) and (parts of) mmtomi-cal medicine (MED).
Each of these two dolnain mod-els adds about 1,400 concepts and relations to theupper model.
Corresponding lexeme entries in thelexicon provide linkages to the entire ontology.We considered a total of 247 genitives in the smn-ple.
Recall was higher for medical texts (57%) thanfor IT documents (31%), though, in general, ratherlow.
However, precision peaked at 97% and 94% fo,"medical and IT texts, respectively.
The mnnt)er ofsyntactic onstructions with modal verbs or auxil-iaries amour to 292 exmnples.
Compared to geni-tives, we obtained a slightly more favorable recallfor both doinains 66% tbr MED, 40% for IT - - ,while precision dropped slightly to 95% and 85% fornmdical and IT documents, respectively.
4As with any such evaluation, idiosyncrasies of the(;overage of the knowledge bases are inevitably tiedwith the results and, thus, put limits on too far-reaching generalizations.
However, our data reflectthe intention to submit a knowledge-intensive textun(lerstmlder to a realistic, i.e., conceptually un-constrained and therefore "unfriendly" test environ-ment.
Judged from tile figures of our recall data,there is no doubt, whatsoever, that conceptual cov-erage of the domain constitutes the bottleneck forany knowledge-based approach to NLP.
s Sublan-guage differences are also mirrored systematically inthese data, since medical texts adhere more closelyto well-established concept axonomies and writingstandards than magazine articles ill the IT domain,whose rhetorical styles vary to a larger degree.8 Re lated  WorkThe standard way of deriving a semantic interpre-tation for constituency-based grammars is to assigneach syntactic rule one or more semantic interpreta-tion rules (e.g., van Eijck and Moore (1992)), and to4A more detailed presentation of this evaluation study isgiven in Romacker and Itahn (20001)).5For the medical domain at least, we are currently activelypursuing research on the semiautomatic creation of large-scaleontologies from weak knowledge sources, viz.
medical termi-nologies; cf.
Schulz and Hahn (2000).determine the meaning of the syntactic head fl'om itsconstituents.
This approach as also been adoptedin the few explicit attempts at incorporating seman-tic interpretation i to a dependency grmninar fi'mne-work (Milward, 1992; Lombardo et al, 1998).
Thereare no constraints on how to design and orgmfize thisrule set despite those that are imI)lied by the choiceof the semantic theory.
In particular, abstractionmechanisms (going beyond the level of sortal tax-onomies for semantic labels, cf., e.g., Creary andPollard (1985)), such as property inheritance, de-faults, are lacking.
Accordingly, the number of rulesincreases rapidly and easily reaches orders of sev-eral lmndreds in a real-world setting (Bean cta l .
,1998).
As an alternative, we provide a small setof gencric semantic interpretation schemata (by theorder of 10) and conceptual interpretation rules (bythe order of 30 for 200 verb concepts) instead ofassigning specific interpretation rules to each gram-mar item (in our case, single lexemes), and incor-porate inheritance-based abstraction in the use ofthese schemata during the intert)retation process inthe knowledge base.
We clearly want to point outthat while this rule system covers a wide varietyof standard syntactic constructions (such as gent-tives, prepositional phrases, various tense and modalforms), it currently does not account fbr quantifica-tional issues (like scope ambiguities) for which en-tirely logic-based approach (Charniak and Goldman,1988; Moore, 1989; Pereira and Pollack, 1991) pro-vide quite sophisticated solutions.Sondheilner et al (1984) and Itirst (1988) treatsemantic interpretation as a direct mapt)ing frontsyntactic to conceptual rel)resentations.
They alsoshm:e with us tim representation f doinain knowl-edge using Kl,-ONE-style terminological languages,and, hence, they nmke heavy use of property inher-itance (or typing) inechanisms.
The main diflbrenceto our approach lies in the status of the semanticrules.
Sondheimer et al (1984) attach single in-terpretatiotl rules to each r'olc (filler) and, hence,have to provide utterly detailed specifications re-flecting the idiosyncrasies of each semantically rele-vant (role) attachment.
Property inheritmme comesonly into play when the selection of alternative se-mantic rules is constrained to the one(s) inheritedfrom the most specific case frame.
In a similar way,Hirst (1988) uses strong typing at the coueeptualobject level only, while we use it simultaneously atthe grmnmar and the domain knowledge level for theprocessing of semantic schemata.9 Conclus ionsWe introduced an al)proach to the design of com-pact, yet highly expressive senmntic interpretationsdmmata.
They derive their power from two sources.First;, the organization of grammar and domain276knowledge, its well as semantic interpretation mcch-alliSllIS: al'e lmsed on inheritance principles.
Soc-ou(1, interpretation schemata l)stract from 1)articu-lar linguistic phenomena (spe('ilic lexical items, lex-eme classes or dependency relations) ill terms of gen-eral contiguration l)atterns in (tepo.nden(-y gral)hs.Underlying these design decisions is a strict sep-aration of linguistic and eouceptual knowledge.
Aclearly defined interface is provided which a.llowsthese st)ecitications to nmke reference to line-grainedhierarchical knowledge, no ma.tter whether it is ofgramnmtical or conceptual origin.
The interface isdivided into two levels.

The other uses theseconstraints in a dynanfic search through a knowl-edge base, that is l/arametrized by few and simI)leschenmta.
Finally, at the level of conceptual in-terprotatiou inferences emerging fl'om senmntic rq)-resentations are COml)uted by a s(.
