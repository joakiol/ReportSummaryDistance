Results show that the models per-form better than the baseline, and theiranalysis confirms previous findings link-ing language and personality, while re-vealing many new linguistic and prosodicmarkers.1 IntroductionIt is well known that utterances convey informationabout the speaker in addition to their semantic con-tent.
One such type of information consists of cuesto the speaker?s personality traits, typically assessedalong five dimensions known as the Big Five (Nor-man, 1963):?
Extraversion (sociability, assertiveness)?
Emotional stability (vs. neuroticism)?
Agreeableness to other people (friendliness)?
Conscientiousness (discipline)?
Intellect (openness to experience)Findings include that extraverts talk more, louder,and faster, with fewer pauses and hesitations, andmore informal language (Scherer, 1979; Furnham,1990; Heylighen and Dewaele, 2002; Gill and Ober-lander, 2002).
Neurotics use more 1st person sin-gular pronouns and negative emotion words, whileconscientious people avoid negations and negativeemotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999).
Theuse of words related to insight and the avoidance ofpast tense indicate intellect, and swearing and neg-ative emotion words mark disagreeableness.
Cor-relations are higher in spoken language, possiblyespecially in informal conversation (Mehl et al, inpress).Previous work has modeled emotion and person-ality in virtual agents, and classified emotions fromactor?s speech (Andre?
et al, 1999; Liscombe et al,2003).
However, to our knowledge no one has testedwhether it is possible to automatically recognize per-sonality from conversation extracts of unseen sub-jects.
Our hypothesis is that automatic analysis ofconversation to detect personality has applicationin a wide range of language processing domains.Identification of leaders using personality dimen-sions could be useful in analyzing meetings and theconversations of suspected terrorists (Hogan et al,1994; Tucker and Whittaker, 2004; Nunn, 2005).Dating websites could analyze text messages to tryto match personalities and increase the chances of asuccessful relationship (Donnellan et al, 2004).
Di-alogue systems could adapt to the user?s personality,like humans do (Reeves and Nass, 1996; Funder andSneed, 1993).
This work is a first step toward indi-vidual adaptation in dialogue systems.We present non-linear statistical models for rank-ing utterances based on the Big Five personalitytraits.
Results show that the models perform sig-nificantly better than a random baseline, and thatprosodic features are good indicators of extraver-sion.
A qualitative analysis confirms previous find-ings linking language and personality, while reveal-ing many new linguistic markers.2 Experimental methodOur approach can be summarized in five steps: (1)collect individual corpora; (2) collect personality85ratings for each participant; (3) extract relevant fea-tures from the texts; (4) build statistical models ofthe personality ratings based on the features; and (5)test the learned models on the linguistic outputs ofunseen individuals.2.1 Spoken language and personality ratingsThe data consists of daily-life conversation extractsof 96 participants wearing an Electronically Acti-vated Recorder (EAR) for two days, collected byMehl et al (in press).
To preserve the participants?privacy, random bits of conversation were recorded,and only the participants?
utterances were tran-scribed, making it impossible to reconstruct wholeconversations.
The corpus contains 97,468 wordsand 15,269 utterances.
Table 1 shows utterances fortwo participants judged as introvert and extravert.Introvert:- Yeah you would do kilograms.
Yeah I see what you?re saying.- On Tuesday I have class.
I don?t know.- I don?t know.
A16.
Yeah, that is kind of cool.- I don?t know.
I just can?t wait to be with you and not haveto do this every night, you know?- Yeah.
You don?t know.
Is there a bed in there?
Well ok just...Extravert:- That?s my first yogurt experience here.
Really watery.
Why?- Damn.
New game.- Oh.- Yeah, but he, they like each other.
He likes her.- They are going to end up breaking up and he?s going to be like.Table 1: Extracts from the corpus, for participantsrated as extremely introvert and extravert.Between 5 and 7 independent observers scoredeach extract using the Big Five Inventory (John andSrivastava, 1999).
Mehl et al (in press) reportstrong inter-observer reliabilities for all dimensions(r = 0.84, p < 0.01).
Average observers?
ratingswere used as the scores for our experiments.2.2 Feature selectionFeatures are automatically extracted from each ex-tract (see Table 2).
We compute the ratio of wordsin each category from the LIWC utility (Pennebakeret al, 2001), as those features are correlated with theBig Five dimensions (Pennebaker and King, 1999).Additional psychological characteristics were com-puted by averaging word feature counts from theMRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981).In an attempt to capture initiative-taking in conversa-tion (Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Furnham, 1990),we introduce utterance type features using heuristicson the parse tree to tag each utterance as a command,prompt, question or assertion.
Overall tagging accu-racy over 100 randomly selected utterances is 88%.As personality influences speech, we also use PraatLIWC FEATURES (Pennebaker et al, 2001):?
STANDARD COUNTS:- Word count (WC), words per sentence (WPS), type/token ratio (Unique),words captured (Dic), words longer than 6 letters (Sixltr), negations(Negate), assents (Assent), articles (Article), prepositions (Preps), num-bers (Number)- Pronouns (Pronoun): 1st person singular (I), 1st person plural (We), total1st person (Self), total 2nd person (You), total 3rd person (Other)?
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES:- Affective or emotional processes (Affect): positive emotions (Posemo),positive feelings (Posfeel), optimism and energy (Optim), negativeemotions (Negemo), anxiety or fear (Anx), anger (Anger), sadness (Sad)- Cognitive Processes (Cogmech): causation (Cause), insight (Insight),discrepancy (Discrep), inhibition (Inhib), tentative (Tentat), certainty(Certain)- Sensory and perceptual processes (Senses): seeing (See), hearing (Hear),feeling (Feel)- Social processes (Social): communication (Comm), other references topeople (Othref), friends (Friends), family (Family), humans (Humans)?
RELATIVITY:- Time (Time), past tense verb (Past), present tense verb (Present),future tense verb (Future)- Space (Space): up (Up), down (Down), inclusive (Incl), exclusive (Excl)- Motion (Motion)?
PERSONAL CONCERNS:- Occupation (Occup): school (School), work and job (Job),achievement (Achieve)- Leisure activity (Leisure): home (Home), sports (Sports), television andmovies (TV), music (Music)- Money and financial issues (Money)- Metaphysical issues (Metaph): religion (Relig), death (Death), physicalstates and functions (Physcal), body states and symptoms (Body),sexuality (Sexual), eating and drinking (Eating), sleeping (Sleep),grooming (Groom)?
OTHER DIMENSIONS:- Punctuation (Allpct): period (Period), comma (Comma), colon(Colon), semi-colon (Semic), question (Qmark), exclamation (Exclam),dash (Dash), quote (Quote), apostrophe (Apostro), parenthesis(Parenth), other (Otherp)- Swear words (Swear), nonfluencies (Nonfl), fillers (Fillers)MRC FEATURES (Coltheart, 1981):Number of letters (Nlet), phonemes (Nphon), syllables (Nsyl), Kucera-Francis written frequency (K-F-freq), Kucera-Francis number of categories(K-F-ncats), Kucera-Francis number of samples (K-F-nsamp), Thorndike-Lorge written frequency (T-L-freql), Brown verbal frequency (Brown-freq), familiarity rating (Fam), concreteness rating (Conc), imageabilityrating (Imag), meaningfulness Colorado Norms (Meanc), meaningfulnessPaivio Norms (Meanp), age of acquisition (AOA)UTTERANCE TYPE FEATURES:Ratio of commands (Command), prompts or back-channels (Prompt),questions (Question), assertions (Assertion)PROSODIC FEATURES:Average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of the voice?s pitchin Hz (Pitch-mean, Pitch-min, Pitch-max, Pitch-stddev) and intensity in dB(Int-mean, Int-min, Int-max, Int-stddev), voiced time (Voiced) and speechrate (Word-per-sec)Table 2: Description of all features, with feature la-bels in brackets.
(Boersma, 2001) to compute prosodic features char-acterizing the voice?s pitch, intensity, and speechrate.2.3 Statistical modelBy definition, personality evaluation assesses rela-tive differences between individuals, e.g.
one per-86son is described as an extravert because the averagepopulation is not.
Thus, we formulate personalityrecognition as a ranking problem: given two indi-viduals?
extracts, which shows more extraversion?Personality models are trained using RankBoost,a boosting algorithm for ranking, for each Big Fivetrait using the observers?
ratings of personality (Fre-und et al, 1998).
RankBoost expresses the learnedmodels as rules, which support the analysis of dif-ferences in the personality models (see section 3).Each rule modifies the conversation extract?s rank-ing score by ?
whenever a feature value exceeds ex-perimentally learned thresholds, e.g.
Rule 1 of theextraversion model in Table 4 increases the score ofan extract by ?
= 1.43 if the speech rate is above0.73 words per second.
Models are evaluated by aranking error function which reports the percentageof misordered pairs of conversation extracts.3 ResultsThe features characterize many aspects of lan-guage production: utterance types, content and syn-tax (LIWC), psycholinguistic statistics (MRC), andprosody.
To evaluate how each feature set con-tributes to the final result, we trained models withthe full feature set and with each set individually.Results are summarized in Table 3.
The baseline is amodel ranking extracts randomly, producing a rank-ing error of 0.5 on average.

statistically significant improvement over the randomordering baseline (two-tailed paired t-test, p < 0.05)Table 3: Ranking errors over a 10 fold cross-validation for different feature sets (Type=utterancetype, Pros=prosody).
Best models are in bold.Paired t-tests show that models of extraversion,agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect usingall features are better than the random ordering base-line (two-tailed, p < 0.05)1.
Emotional stability isthe most difficult trait to model, while agreeableness1We also built models of self-reports of personality, but noneof them significantly outperforms the baseline.and conscientiousness produce the best results, withranking errors of 0.31 and 0.33 respectively.
Table 3shows that LIWC features perform significantly bet-ter than the baseline for all dimensions but emo-tional stability, while emotional stability is best pre-dicted by MRC features.
Interestingly, prosodic fea-tures are very good predictors of extraversion, witha lower ranking error than the full feature set (0.26),while utterance type features on their own never out-perform the baseline.The RankBoost rules indicate the impact of eachfeature on the recognition of a personality trait bythe magnitude of the parameter ?
associated withthat feature.
Table 4 shows the rules with the mostimpact on each best model, with the associated ?values.
The feature labels are in Table 2.
For ex-ample, the model of extraversion confirms previousfindings by associating this trait with a high speechrate (Rules 1 and 4) and longer conversations (Rule5).
But many new markers emerge: extraverts speakwith a high pitch (Rules 2, 6 and 7), while introverts?pitch varies a lot (Rules 15, 18 and 20).
Agreeablepeople use longer words but shorter sentences (Rule1 and 20), while swear words reduce the agreeable-ness score (Rules 12, 18 and 19).
As expected, con-scientious people talk a lot about their job (Rule 1),while unconscientious people swear a lot and speakloudly (Rules 19 and 20).
Our models contain manyadditional personality cues which aren?t identifiedthrough a typical correlational analysis.4 ConclusionWe showed that personality can be recognized auto-matically in conversation.
To our knowledge, this isthe first report of experiments testing trained mod-els on unseen subjects.
There are models for eachdimension that perform significantly better than thebaseline.
Combinations of these models may be use-ful to identify important personality types in dif-ferent NLP applications, e.g.
a combination ofextraversion, emotional stability and intellect indi-cates leadership, while low intellect, extraversionand agreeableness are correlated with perceptions oftrustworthiness.One limitation for applications involving speechrecognition is that recognition errors will introducenoise in all features except prosodic features, andprosodic features on their own are only effective inthe extraversion model.
However, our data set is rel-atively small (96 subjects) so we expect that more87# Extraversion Emotional stability Agreeableness Conscientiousness Intellectwith prosody ?
