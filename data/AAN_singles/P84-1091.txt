AN ALGORITHM FOR IDENTIFYING COGNATES BETWEEN RELATED LANGUAGESJacques B.M.
GuyLinguistics Department (RSPacS)Australian National UniversityGPO Box 4, Canberra 2601 AUSTRALIAABSTRACTThe algorithm takes as only input a llst ofwords, preferably but not necessarily in phonemictranscription, in any two putatively relatedlanguages, and sorts it into decreasing order ofprobable cognatlon.
The processing of a 250-1tembilingual list takes about five seconds of CPU timeon a DEC KLI091, and requires 56 pages of corememory.
The algorithm is given no informationwhatsoever about the phonemic transcription .used,and even though cognate identi f icat ion is carriedout on the basis of a context-free one-for-onematching of indivldual characters, its cognationdecisions are bettered by a trained linguist usingmore information only in cases of wordllsts sharingless than 40% cognates and involving complex,mu\]tlple sound correspondences.I FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURESA.
Identifying Sound CorrespondencesConsider the following wordllst from twohypothetical Austronesian-llke ivnguages:Titla Sese"eye" mats nas"sea" tasi sah"father" tams san"mother" mama nan"tongue" miml nen"shellfish" slsl hehe"bad" satl has"to stand" tl se"to come" me na"with" ml ne"not" sa haTake the first word pair, mata/nas.
We baseno information about the phonetic values of theirconstituent characters, we do not know whether thesame system of transcription was used in bothwordllsts: for all we know "a" might denotes a highback rounded vowel in Tit~a and a uvular trill inSese.
The only assumption allowed is that in eachword llst the same characters represent, more orless, the same sounds.
Under this assumption, thepossibility that any one character of a member of aword pair may correspond to any character of theother member cannot be discarded.
Thus in the pairmata/nas Titia "m" may correspond to Sese "n", "a",or "s", and so may Titia "a", "t", "s", and "s".We summarize the evidence for thesepossible correspondences in an TxS matrix, whereT is the number of different characters found inthe Titla wordllst, S that in the Sese wordllst.Thus the evidence afforded by the first pair,mats/has:Sumsa e h n s of rowsa 2 0 0 2 2 6i 0 0 0 0 0 0m I 0 0 i I 3s 0 0 0 0 0 0t I 0 0 1 I 3Sums ofcolumns4 0 0 4 4 12And by all i i  pa i r s :Sumse e h n s of rowsa I0 0 3 9 6 28i 2 6 6 5 5 22m 5 3 0 12 2 22s 3 2 7 0 2 14t 4 i 2 2 5 14Sums ofcolumns24 12 18 28 18 I00Matrix A (observed frequencies)If character correspondences between tbeTitla and Sese word pairs were random the expectedfrequency e\[i,J\] of recorded possible correspon-448dences between the ith character of the Tltlaalphabet and the jth of the Sese alphabet would be:e\[i ,J\] -sum of ith row x sum of Jth columnsum of cellsgiving a matrix of expected frequencies of possiblesound correspondences:Sumse h n s of rowsa 6.72 3.36 5.04 7.84 5.04 28t 5.28 2.64 3.96 6.16 3.96 22m 5.28 2.64 3.96 6.16 3.96 22S 3.36 1.68 2.52 3.92 2.52 14t 3.36 1.68 2.52 3.92 2.52 14Sums ofcolumns24 12 18 28 18 100Matr ix  B (expected frequencies)Note how the six character correspondenceswlth the greatest d i f fe rences  between observed andexpected frequencies give the simple substitutioncode used for generating Seat words from pseudo-Austroneslan Titla:T i t ta  Sese Observed - Expectedm n 5.84s h 4.48i e 3.36a a 3.28t s 2.48B.
Identifying Null CorrespondencesCall the difference between the observedand the expected frequency of a character corres-pondence i t s  weight (s much l ess  primitivedefinition of weight is used In the actualimplementation).Take the first word palr (mats/has) andenter into a 4x3 matrix W the wel~hts of its 12poss ib le  character  cor respondences :n a sm 5.84 -0.28 -1.96a 1.16 3.28 0.96t -1.92 0.64 2.48a 1.16 3.28 0.96Matr ix  W (weights)Call potential of a character correspon-dence the sum of its weight and of the highestpotential of all possible character correspondencesto its right, i.e.Pot(i,J) = W\[I,J\] + max(Pot(i+l..m,J+l..n))giving the matrix of potentials P for word pairmata/nafl :n a am 11.60 2.28 -1.96a 4.44 5.76 0.96t 1.36 1.60 2.48a 1.16 3.28 0.96Matrix P (petentlals)The character correspondence with  theblghest potential is here m/n (P\[I,I\]-II.6).

A Relative Measure of CognatlonCall index of cognatlon the maximumpotentlal of a word palr divided by its number ofcor respondences ,  including null cor respondences .Thus in  the f i c t i t ious  case o f  T t t ia  and Sese tbeindex  o f  cognat ton  o f  the pa i r  mats/has i s  2 .9  ( i t smaximum potent ia l ,  11.60,  d iv ided  by the number o fcor respondences ,  4 ) .
Word pa i rs  w i th  h igh  cognat ionindices are foun~ to  be more often geneticallyrelated than pairs with  low cognatlon indices.I I  C l~REl~'rr DIPLF24E ~rAT I0NA.
Weights.The difference between observed andexpected frequencies does not provide asatisfactory measurement of the weight of aposslble character correspondence.
Severalalternative measurements were tested, out of whlcbstandardized scores were retained: the weight of acharacter correspondence was redefined as the449probabillty of the discrepancy between its observedand expected frequencies of occurrence not beJngdue to chance, expressed as a z score.
Whereabsolute frequencies of 20 and less are involvedthe exact probabillty is calculated and translatedinto a z score using a polynomial approximation(Abramowitz and Stegun 1970).B.
Vowel/Consonant CorrespondencesDisallowing correspondences between vowelsand consonants vastly improved the performance ofthe algorltbm.
No human intervention is needed toidentify vowels from consonants, an improvedversion of an algorithm described in Suhotln 1962being used to identify characters which representvowel sounds.
Whether consonants should be allowedto correspond to vowels is left as an option in thecurrent implementation.C.
IterationsPerformance is again improved when wordpairs showing individual character matches ascomputed from matrices of potentlals (section IBabove) are reprocessed.
The weights of possiblecharacter correspondences are recomputed.
Thistime, however, only characters in the samepositions in the two words are scored as possiblecorrespondences.
Thus for instance, the first passof the algorithm having matched the "m" of "mata"to the "n" of "nas", Titla "m" is scored in thesecond pass as corresponding possibly only to Sese"n".
Sequences of alternate null correspondencesare collapsed so as not to preclude theidentification of correspondences which might havebeen missed in the first pass, e.g.
a pair mat/motmatched in the first pass asm mzero oa zerot tis relnput in the second pass asm ma ot tWeights of possible character correspon-dences having thus been recomputed, a new matrix ofpotentials and a new cognatlon index is computedfor each word pair.
Further iterations were foundto yield negligible improvements to the resultsobtained.D.
Improved Weights and Cognation IndicesFrequent character correspondences oftenyield very high z scores (up to 1@.2).
The presenceof even one such hl~h score in a word pair ofteninvalidates the character-matchlng procedure.
Anumber of alternative alterations to the definitionof weight were tried, out of which the simplestproved best: weights beyond an arbitrary value areset to that value.
Practice showed a maximum valueof 3.0 to 4.0 to give the best results.
This is notsurprlsing, since there is Do significantdifference in the degrees of certaintycorresponding to z scores of 4 and beyond.The last improvement in the performance ofthe algorithm to date was brought by a redefinitionof the cognatlon index.
Once the individualcharacter  matches of  a word pa i r  have beenidentified from its matrix of potentials theirweights are adjusted as follows:I) Positive weights less tban 1.28 (correspondingto a 90% significance level) are set to zero;negative weights and weights greater than 1.28 areleft unchanged.2) Positive weights of character-to-zero matchesare set to zero; negative weights are leftunchanged.The cognatlon index is then defined as thesum of the adjusted weights divided by the numberof matches, e.g.
(an actual example from twolanguages of Vanuatu):WeightOriglnal Adjustedx zero -0.64a a 3.98h D 1.06a zero 2.12t D 3.12i I 2.86a zero 2.12Cognatlon index: 9.32/8-0.643.980.000.003.122.860.009.32= 1.165III PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHMThe algorithm as described has beenimplemented in Simula 67 on a DEC ELI091 andapplied to a corpus of some 300 words in 75languages and dialects of Vanuatu.
Results areexcellent for languages sharing 40% or morecognates, even when sound correspondences arecomplex.
They deteriorate rapldly when lesserproportions of cognates and complex soundcorrespondences are involved, but remain excellentwhen mainly one-to-one correspondences are present.Thus for instance Sakao and Tolomako (EspirltuSanto, Vanuatu) were given as sharing 38.91~cognates (cut-off cognation index: 1.28), asagainst a human estimate of 41% backed by a fullknowledge of their dlachronlc phonologles andcomparisons with other related languages.
Out ofthe 50 word pairs with the highest cognationindices only two (the 38th and the 45th) weredeflnltely not cognate and one (the 36th) doubtful.Yet, Sakao has undergone extremely complexphonological changes, viz.

This problem has of course been, and isbeing, investigated.
Difficulties arise from thefact that frequencies of possible correspondencesin any given environment become too low to behandled by statlstlcal tests.
Other approaches --inspired from chess-playlng programs -- have beentried, but have proved too expensive in computertlme so far.
A further, much desirable, improvementis the ~dentlfication of rules of metatbesis.
Thesolution to this problem appears to be subordinatedto that of the dlscovery of context-sensitiverules.V PURPOSE OF THE ALGORITHMA billngua\] wordllst is conceptuallyequivalent to a bilingual text: words of a llst tosentences of a text, phonemes of s word tomorphemes of a sentence, cognate pairs to segmentsof the same meaning, non-cognates to segments ofdifferent meanings, and the algorithm described istbe present state of an attempted solution to themuch more general fol\]owlng problem: given twotexts of approximately equal lengths in twodifferent languages, determine whether one is thetranslation of tbe other -- or both translations ofa text in a third language -- wholly or In parts,and If so, establish the rules for translating oneinto the other.VI REFERENCESAbramowitz, Milton and I rene  A.
