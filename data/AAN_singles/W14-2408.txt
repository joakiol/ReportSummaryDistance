2010) rep-resentation of caused motion, thereby al-so providing (a sample of) the computa-tional infrastructure for implementing theinformation that FrameNet has character-ized as Caused_motion1 (Ruppenho-fer et al.
2010).
This work specifies thesemantic structure of caused motion innatural language, using an EmbodiedConstruction Grammar analyzer that in-cludes the semantic parsing of linguisti-cally instantiated constructions.
Resultsfrom this type of analysis can serve as theinput to NLP applications that requirerich semantic representations.1 IntroductionComputational linguistics recognizes the difficul-ty in articulating the nature of complex events,including causation, while understanding thatdoing so is fundamental for creating natural lan-guage processing (NLP) systems (e.g.
Girju2003, Quang et al.
2011), and more generally forother computational techniques (Guyon et al.2007, Friedman et al.
2000).
Also, although in-sightful, linguistic analyses of causation are in-sufficient for systems that require drawing theinferences that humans draw with ease.
Such sys-tems must incorporate information about the pa-rameters that support drawing these inferences.Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG) pro-vides the computational and representational ap-paratus for capturing what language expresses.FrameNet (FN) frames capture event structurein terms of the participants that play a role in thatevent.
ECG provides a means for the automaticidentification of frames and frame roles ex-1 Courier New font indicates a FrameNet frame;and small CAPS indicate a FE in a FN frame.pressed in any given sentence.
Here, we focus ona pair of sentences that illustrate the rich mean-ings and relations characterized in FN frames asrepresented in ECG.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2includes background information on FrameNet(FN) and ECG; Section 3 describes the FNtreatment of Caused_motion, and the ECGrepresentation of the CauseMotion schema,which constitutes the meaning block of theCause_motion construction; Section 4 summa-rizes the ECG analysis of motion and caused mo-tion example sentences; and Section 5 discussesnew directions for future work with ECG repre-sentations of information structured in FrameNetframes (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu).2 BackgroundChang et al.
(2002) constitutes the first effort torepresent the prose description of the informationthat FN has defined in semantic frames in formalterms.
The work provided an ECG representationof FN?s (then) Commerce frame, showing theperspicuity of doing so to account for linguisticperspective, and ultimately useful in translatingFN information into a representation needed forevent simulation (Narayanan 1997).
Building onChang et al.
(2002), this paper focuses on theanalysis and representation of the meanings ofsentences describing different kinds of motionevents, using a set of related semantic frames.Before detailing the examples that illustrate theanalysis and representation, we offer a very briefoverview of FN and ECG.2.1 FrameNetThe FrameNet knowledge base holds uniqueinformation on the mapping of meaning to formvia the theory of Frame Semantics (Fillmore andBaker 2010), at the heart of which is the seman-tic frame, i.e.
an experience-based schematiza-tion of the language user?s world that allows in-ferences about participants and objects in andacross situations, states of affairs, and events.
FN39has characterized nearly 1,200 frames, more than12,740 lexical units (LUs), where a lexical unit isa pairing of a lemma and a frame, and approxi-mately 200,000 manually annotated examplesentences that illustrate usage of each LU.A FN frame definition includes a prose de-scription of a prototypical situation, along with aspecification of the frame elements (FEs), or se-mantic roles, that uniquely characterize that situ-ation.
For example, FN has defined Motion as asituation in which a THEME starts out at aSOURCE, moves along a PATH, and ends up at aGOAL.2  Example (1) illustrates FN?s analysis ofSLIDE, one of many LUs, in the Motionframe, also indicating which constituents in thesentence are the linguistic realizations of the FEsTHEME and GOAL.
(1) [The envelope THEME] SLID [intothe mailbox GOAL].2.2 Embodied Construction GrammarAn ECG grammar (Feldman et al.
2010) consistsof structured lattices of two basic primitives:schemas and constructions.
As with other formsof construction grammar, a key tenet of ECG isthat each construction is a form-meaning pair.Constructional meaning is represented usingschemas, which are analogous to FN frames.Each schema includes several roles (comparableto FN?s FEs), and specifies various types of con-straints on its roles.
Thus, the ECG formalismprovides the means for representing frame struc-ture and relations in a precise and computational-ly tractable manner.Crucially, our computationally implementedsystem (Bryant 2008) uses an ECG grammar forsentence interpretation and produces construc-tion-based semantic parses.
The ConstructionalAnalyzer utilizes form and meaning infor-mation in the constructional analysis of a givensentence.
Thus, constructional analysis is not justa form match; importantly, it is a meaning matchas well.
The output of the analysis is a semanticspecification, a meaning representation in theform of schemas, roles, bindings, and role-fillerinformation.
Constructional analysis is part of alarger model of language understanding, inwhich the semantic specification, in conjunctionwith discourse and situational context, serves asan input for a simulation process, which fleshes2 FN also describes another scenario for Motion, notincluded here for space-saving reasons.out and supports further inferences about the rel-atively schematic meaning specified in the text.Among the potential applications for suchdeep semantic analysis are question-answeringtasks, information extraction, and identifyingdifferent political viewpoints.
Each task has itsown requirements in terms of constructions andsemantic representations.
This paper illustrates acomputationally implemented means for deter-mining the frames and frame roles in a givensentence, as well as the particular entities thatlink to those roles.Figure 1 shows the ECG formalism that repre-sents the semantic structure of FN?s Motionframe, where the MotionPath schema specifiesthe structural relationships among the partici-pants (FEs) in FN?s Motion frame.Figure 1: MotionPath SchemaECG defines MotionPath as a subcase of thevery general Motion schema; as a child of theMotion schema, MotionPath inherits the struc-ture of Motion, the latter including a mover role.Also, MotionPath evokes a Source-Path-Goal(SPG) schema, which includes the roles source,path, and goal, for the initial, medial, and finallocations, respectively, of a trajector.
MotionPathalso includes a constraint that the mover isbound to the trajector role.A construction is a pairing between form andmeanng, the ECG representation of which con-sists of a form block and a meaning block.
Toillustrate, in Figure 2, which shows the simplelexical construction Slid_Past, the form blockindicates the orthographic form associated withthe lexical construction.
The form constraint in-dicates that the constraint applies to the form ofthe construction (self.f.orth <-- ?slid?
), where.orth indicates that the form is a text string, inthis case ?slid?.
ECG represents constructionalmeaning using schemas; in the Slid_Past con-struction, (Figure 2), the meaning is identifiedwith the MotionPath schema (as shown in Figure1).
Constructions also define relations to other40constructions in the grammar.
For instance,Slid_Past is a subcase of a more generalPastTense construction.
The PastTense construc-tion is one of several general verb conjugationconstructions in the grammar, each of which cap-tures general facts about tense and aspect associ-ated with different verb conjugation forms.
Forexample, all past tense verbs, including slid (aninstantiation of Slid_Past), use PastTense.Figure 2: Slid_Past Construction3 Caused_motionThis section describes FN?s characterization ofCaused_motion and provides the ECG rep-resentation of the CausedMotion schema, i.e., themeaning of the Cause_motion construction.3.1 FrameNetFrameNet characterizes Caused_motion asa situation in which an AGENT causes a THEMEto undergo translation motion, where the motionalso may always be described with respect to aSOURCE, PATH, and GOAL.3   Example (2) showsthe FN analysis with SLIDE as the target verb inCaused_motion, marking the constituentsthat fill the AGENT, THEME, and GOAL roles.
(2) [Smedlap AGENT] SLID [the envelopeTHEME] into the mailbox GOAL].Note that whereas FN?s Caused_motionframe has an AGENT FE, Motion does not.Table 1: FN?s Motion and Caused_motion3 As with Motion, FN also defines another scenariofor Caused_motion, specifically one with a CAUSEFE, excluded here because of space limitations.3.2 Embodied Construction GrammarThe ECG representation of CauseMotion, givenin Figure 3, is a complex schema that combinesthe structure of causation with that of transla-tional motion.
The causal structure is supplied bydefining CauseMotion as a subcase of a moregeneral CauseEffect schema, which includesroles for a causal agent and an affected entity.Also, CauseMotion specifies that the effect istranslational motion, indicated with the additionof a type constraint that identifies the effect withthe MotionPath schema.Figure 3: CauseMotion SchemaAdditional constraints bind the mover role ofMotionPath (Figure 1) to the affected role ofCauseMotion.
Thus, the ECG mover (i.e.
the FETHEME) is bound to the affected role; and themotion itself is bound to the effect.
ECG uses theCauseMotion schema to analyze sentences suchas Example (2), an instance of the Cause_motionconstruction, a summary of which follows belowin Section 4.4 ECG for Linguistic AnalysisHere, we provide an overview of the ECG analy-sis process for the examples discussed above.A basic tenet of construction grammar is thateach sentence instantiates multiple constructions.Bryant?s (2008) computationally implementedConstructional Analyzer uses an ECG grammarto determine the set of constructions that best-fita given sentence.4  The assessment of ?best-fit?takes both syntactic and semantic informationinto account.
Constructional unification requirescompatibility between unifying elements.
Unifi-cation tests the compatibility of the constraintsthat these constructions specify, and leads to var-ious bindings.
The analyzer produces a SemSpec,i.e.
a semantic specification of the sentence, thatis, a meaning representation in the form of anetwork of schemas, with bindings betweenschema roles and fillers of these roles.4 ECG Workbench provides an interface to the ana-lyzer, and allows the viewing of analysis results.41To illustrate the analysis process, we revisitExample (1) The envelope slid into the mailbox,which instantiates some of the following lexicaland grammatical constructions:?
Lexical constructions for slid,  nouns (enve-lope, mailbox), and determiners (the)?
NP constructions (the envelope, the mailbox)?
Declarative construction, a clause-level con-struction spanning the sentence as a whole.In what follows, we define and explain theconstructions in Example (1) that are crucial forthe present analysis of Motion and CausedMo-tion.
Specifically, the Active_Motion_Path con-struction (Figure 4) is a sub-case of a more gen-eral Argument Structure construction (Goldberg1995, Dodge 2010).
Argument Structure (A-S)constructions specify general patterns of role ex-pression associated with the description of basicexperiences, such as those involving motion,perception, object transfer, actions and/or causa-tion.
Schemas represent each type of experienceand include roles for the relevant participant(s).A-S constructions include one or more constitu-ent constructions, specified within their con-structional block.
All A-S constructions includea verb constituent (V: Verb); here, note that theActive_Motion_Path construction also contains aprepositional phrase constituent (PP), con-strained to be of type Path-PP, a general con-struction that identifies its meaning with the SPGschema.
The form block specifies ordering con-straints: the V constituent comes before the PPconstituent.
The meaning block specifies that theconstruction?s meaning is identified with the Mo-tionPath schema, indicating that the constructiondescribes translational motion events.
Con-straints within the meaning block specify howthe meaning of the construction as a whole com-poses with the meanings of its constituents.
As isusually the case, the ?V?
constituent shares thesame schematic meaning as the A-S construc-tion.
These constraints indicate that the A-S con-struction will unify with verbs that identify theirmeaning with the MotionPath schema, as in themotion verbs roll, slip, bounce, etc, along withslide.
Thus, this A-S construction captures a par-ticular valence pattern associated with severalsemantically similar verbs.A further meaning constraint indicates that themeaning of the PP constituent serves to elaboratethe SPG schema that forms part of the meaningof the MotionPath schema.
That is, whicheverspecific PP serves as a constituent in a given ex-ample will supply more information about theparticular path of motion the mover is following.Additionally, the mover role of MotionPath isbound to the profiledParticipant role (i.e., thesemantic correlate of the role expressed in thesentence?s subject slot), and the meaning of theconstruction as a whole binds to an eventProcessrole, which indicates the type of event that thisA-S construction describes.Figure 4: Active_Motion_Path ConstructionConstraint-based unification of the instantiatedconstruction produces a SemSpec that includesthe following information: (1) a MotionPathschema is co-indexed with the ?eventProcess?role, indicating that the sentence describes anevent of translational motion; (2) the meaning ofthe envelope is co-indexed with the profiledPar-ticipant role, the mover of MotionPath, and thetrajector of SPG, indicating that this object is thesemantic subject of the sentence, and that it is theentity that moves and changes location with re-spect to a landmark; and (3) the meaning of themailbox is co-indexed with the landmark of SPG,and the boundedObject role of a BoundedObjectschema.
The source of SPG is bound to the exte-rior role of boundedObject.
The goal of SPG isbound to the interior of boundedObject.
Togeth-er, these bindings indicate that the mailbox isconceptualized as a bounded object or container,the envelope?s initial location (source) is outsideof the mailbox, and its final location is inside.Having analyzed a sentence about motion, wereturn to our example of caused motion: (2)Smedlap slid the envelope into the mailbox.
Thissentence instantiates many of the same construc-tions as does Example (1).
The key differencebetween the two is the A-S construction, here the42Active_Transitive_Caused_Motion construction,shown below in Figure 5.Figure 5:Active_Transitive_Caused_MotionThis is similar to the Active_Motion_Path con-struction in that it has both a V and a PP constit-uent.
However, as with other A-S constructionsthat characterize transitives, this A-S construc-tion also includes an NP constituent, whose formfollows that of the verb.
Crucially, this A-S con-struction identifies its meaning with CauseMo-tion, indicating that it is used to describe sceneswhich a causal agent causes the translational mo-tion of some other entity.
Meaning constraintsspecify that the affected role of CauseMotion isbound to the meaning of the NP constituent, andthe causer role is bound to the profiled partici-pant role.
This latter constraint indicates that thisactive voice construction describes caused mo-tion events from the causer?s perspective.Using these constructions, the analysis of Ex-ample (2) produces a SemSpec that is similar tothat produced for Example (1), with the follow-ing key differences:?
the eventProcess is CausedMotion (ra-ther than MotionPath);?
the profiledParticipant role is bound tothe causer role of CauseMotion, and toSmedlap;?
the envelope is bound to the affectedrole of CauseMotion, as well as to themover role of MotionPath, and the tra-jector role of SPG.This SemSpec for Example (2) indicates that:?
the sentence describes an event of causedmotion, represented by the CauseMotionschema;?
the caused effect is motion, representedby the MotionPath schema;?
the subject (Smedlap) is the causer of themotion;?
the direct object (the envelope) is thecausally affected entity that moves.?
the path of motion is one where with thegoal location inside the entity that theprepositional phrase object (the mailbox)specifies, just  as in Example (1).To summarize, the semantic representationoutput of the ECG analysis process for each ofExamples (1) and (2) identifies that they evokethe MotionPath and CauseMotion schemas, re-spectively (analogous to FN?s Motion andCause_Motion, respectively).
Also, the out-put specifies the different roles (FEs) that thedifferent constituents of each sentence realize.Thus, the information provided by such outputidentifies the frames and frame roles expressedin each sentence.5 ExtensionsGiven the compositional nature of the ECGgrammar, it will also support the analysis of oth-er sentences describing translational motion andcaused motion events that differ in terms of thelexical items that are realized.
Consider the fol-lowing new examples.?
His hat is slipping off his head.?
Did the dog roll the ball under the table??
Which leaf fell off the tree?Moreover, the approach outlined here clearlyalso would apply to the analysis of all FrameNetframes that characterize, for instance, cognition,perception, communication or other causalevents or transitive actions.Research has begun to extend the present workto support the analysis of metaphorical uses ofmotion and caused motion frame structure, as in:The young family slid into poverty or Their hugedebts dragged the young family into poverty.This research requires the specification of appro-priate constraints on the fillers of the roles thatwill facilitate distinguishing between the literaland the metaphorical.ReferencesJ.
