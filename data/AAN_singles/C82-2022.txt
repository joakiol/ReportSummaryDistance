REVISING AN ATN PARSERGiacomo Ferrari, Irina ProdanofIstituto dl Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, Pisa, Italy1.
An ATN parser  fo r  I ta l ian  has  been deve loped andtes ted  in  a ser ies  o f  exper iments  on complex  sentences  takenf rom nar ra t ive  texts  (1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ) .
The const ruct ion  o f  a complexgraemmz as  we l l  as  the  resu l t s  o f  our  exper iments  showed somel imi ts  and inadequac ies  o f  Woods" ATN as i t  s tands  (11) ,espec ia l l y  when used  to  parse  I ta l ian ,  a re la t ive ly  f ree -o rder  language w i th  a we l l  deve loped morpho log ica l  sys tem.1 .1 .
"Parameter -pass ing"  ac t ions  such  as  SENDR andLIFTR have  been o f ten  Judged "d i r ty"  operat ions  under  a fo rm-a l  v iew-po in t .
Moreover  i t  i s  a lmost  imposs ib le  to  keep  thecont ro l  o f  the  c ross - leve l  pa~sed in fo rmat ion ,  un less  the~umber o f  reg is ters  i s  inc reased .
Such an  increase  i s  o ther -w ise  unmot ivated .
Th is  d i f f i cu l ty  i s  more ev ident  in  I ta l ianrelative clauses such as:L" uomo la  cu i  c rude l ta"  tu t t i  conose iamoThe man ( the)  whose c rue l ty  everyone  knowsL" uomo la  c rude l ta"  de l  qua le  tu t t i  conosc ismoThe man the  c rue l ty  o f  whom everyone  knowsL ?
uomo de l  des ider io  d i  vendet ta  de l  qua le  t i  he par la toThe man about  the  des i re  fo r  revenge o f  whom I spoke to  youin  wh ich  a very  heavy  use  o f  such  act ions ,  as  we l l  as  o ff lags ,  i s  requ i red .
These  phenomena,  together  w i th  the  r i ch -ness  o f  morpho log ica l  in f lex ion ,  inc rease  the  necess i ty  fo rmorpho log ica l  and morpho-syntact i c  shor t ,  l ong-d is tance  andcross-level tests.- I01  -1.2 ,  Another problem i s  proposed by the s t ruc tura l  ambi-8~i ty  of  sequences of  PP 's ,  fo r  which both the "embedding" andthe "same- leve l "  hypotheses are presented!
a sentence  wi th  )PP's has 5 parses accordlng to the schema(PPI (PP2 (PP3))), (PPI (PF2)(PP3)), (PFI (PI~) PP3),(PP1P~ (PP3)), (PP1 P~ PP3)An attempt to limit th~s explosion was made by adding oertaln.functional labels depending upon the verb frame.
This experim-ent showed that  a t tent ion  should be focussed on deve lop ing  anadequate system of  funct iona l  tes ts .1 .3 .
A s ta t i s t i ca l l y  based,  dynsmic heur i s t i c  mechanismhas been put to  work in  the t raversa l  of  the network.
Thosepaths which have been more f requent ly  t raversed  in  prev iousparsed f rasments  of  a g iven text  are at tempted f i r s t ,  dur ingthe ana lys i s  of  the CUZTent sentence  (6 ) .In  th i s  way, the concept of  performance based syntact i cexpectat ion  has been in t roduced  and tes ted .
I t  appeared thatATN i s  very  su i ted  to the  in t roduct ion  of  heur i s t i c  techn iquesand a lso  that  these  techn iques  should inc lude  a schedu l ingprocedure based on arc  types  (10) .2.
A rev is ion  of  the l ingu is t i c  formal ism as we l l  as ofthe  pars ing  a lSor i thm i s  now in  p rogress ,  and should take a l lthese  cons iderat ions  in to  account .
Furthermore,  those  l insu is t -i o  phenomena re la ted  to conversat ion  such as anaphora and theana lys i s  o f  par t ia l  and par t ia l l y  cor rec t  input  must be takenin to  account in  the  des i s~ ing  of  the formal ism and the ATNact ions  and forms,  not only fo r  app l i ca t ive  purposes ,  butabove a l l  in  o rder  to en la rge  the  range of  phenomena to beinc luded  in  a ~ammar .2 .1 .

Access to p rec i se  locat ion  of th i s  s t ruc tureis guaranteed by the functional labels.
Traditional ATNregisters can be locally used for special purposes.
A detail-ed description of our whole mechanism including examples willbe given?Already assigned functional labels cannot be chanEed!left concatenation of them has been preferred (8).
A mechanismhas also been provided to move pointers from constituents togape or anaphorical pronouns (inside the sentence borders) (5).This is an attempt to treat by a uniform action or sequenceof actions equ/-NP deletion, gapplng, coordination.2.3.
Some local procedures connected with the lexiconhave been added to these mechanisms.
These procedures includethe transmission of feature's to higher level nodes in thestructure, the proceduralisation of idiosyncrasies of singleleKical entries and "paraphrase'.
The latter is expected toreduce nominalizatlon to the corresponding verb with itsframe components and to account for linguistic units whichhave identical distribution and syntactic behavlour.2.4?
The present list of "linguistically* motivatedprocesses is open-ended, as we are now trying to identifyothers, which can be considered to be linguistic (procedural)?um/versals "?- 103  -(1) A.Oappelll, G.
