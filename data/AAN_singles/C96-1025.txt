The methods described have1)een imi)lemente<l and applie(l on Frenchtexts in the medical domain.1 In t roduct ion\[\]ii(ter the eomt)ositional assulnption, senmntieanalysis relies on the combination of the mean-ing representations of parts to build the meaningrepresentations of a whole.
However, this con>position often needs to call on implicit knowledgewhi(:h helps to link the two meaning representa-tions.
This is the (:as(*,, for institute, in metonymi("expressions, where a word is used to express anotion closely related to its central meaning.
Awell-known stream of work addressing this t)he-nomellon is the Generative Lexicon theory (Puste-jovsky, 1991).
At the heart of this theory is a lex-ical semantic representation called "qualia struc~lure", Met(mymies are considered to correspondto changes in the semantic types of the words in-*This work has been imrtly supporte, d by the Eu-tel)earn project MENELAS (AIM 2023).volved, and the qualia structure provides the basisfor performing type coercion in a generative, way.We address here, the treatment of metonymieexpressions from a knowledge representation per-spe(:tive, in the context of the MENF, I,AS medi-cal text understanding syste, m (Zweigenbaum etal., 1995).
One of the goals of the overall systemis to assign stan(tar(lised, medi(:al nomenclaturecodes to the input texts (patient discharge sum-maries).
Semantic analysis st~rts from a syntac-tic representation f each sentence and produces aconceptual representation.
It is then used by sev-e, ral language-independent, k owledge-based com-ponents to perform inferences (pragmatic enrich-nlellt) and then code assignment (Delamarre tal., 1!)95).
Therefore,, the, conceptual represen-tation outtmt by the semantic analyser nmst benormalised: it must ('onform to a knowledge repre-sentation canon in which the target nomenclature(:odes can lie nlal)ped.
'l'he si)eciiication of thiscanon relies on the description of a rich model ofthe domain in a knowledge representation formal-ism, here Conceptual Graphs (CG) (Sowa, 1984).We focus in this patter on the part of the se-mantic analyser that deals with semantic ('ore-position.
The conceptual reI)resentation builtmust be abstracted from initial linguistic varia-tion, metonymy being a typical problem to be ad-dressed.
We ext)lain how we use the domain mo(lelto handle metonymy, and more generally, to un-derlie semantic omposition, using the knowledgedescriptions attached to each concept of our ontol-ogy as a kind of concept-level, multiple-role qualiastructure.
The methods described have been im-plemented and applied to French texts.We first recall the problem addressed (sec-tion 2).
Then, the pr()posed method is described(section 3) and illustrated on an example.
We givesome information on the imt)lementation a d theresults of the analyser (section 4), and discuss tit(,'relatiw', merits of the method (section 5).2 Metonymy and type coercionA (:lassical exainple of metonynly (Pustejovsky,1.991, It.
428ff) is137(1) John began a novel.where predicate 'began' expects an event as itssecond argument, so that some way must be foundto relate the object 'novel' to an event such as 'toread a novel' or 'to write a novel'.
In our do-main (coronary diseases), one often finds expres-sions such as(2) une angioplastie du segment II (an angio-plasty of segment II)(3) une angioplastie d'une artbre coronaire (anangioplasty of a coronary artery)(4) l'angioplastie de Monsieur X (the angioplastyof Mr X)(5) une angioplastie de la st6nose (an angioplastyof the stenosis)where 'angioplasty' is an action performed on asegment of an artery to enlarge its diameter, while'stenosis' is the state of an artery which has a re-duced diameter.
These four phrases involve theobject (or "theme") of action 'angioplasty', i.e.,what the angioplasty operates upon.
If one con-siders that this theme must be a physical ob-ject, then examples (2)-(4) conform to the selec-tional restrictions of 'angioplasty', while (5) vi-olates them.
The mechanism of type coercion(Pustejovsky, 1991) consists in converting a wordtype into another so that semantic ompositioncan work properly.
(5) is then handled as ametonymy, where the stenosis and the stenosedobject enter a state/thing alternation: 'stenosis'is turned into an 'object'.However, it appears that this phenomenon is de-pendent on the underlying types (or "sorts") un-der consideration.
For instance in our ontology,'segment', 'artery', 'stenosis' and 'human' havefour different ypes, and are not comparable bythe IS-A relation, e.g.
nothing can be both a seg-ment and an artery} This is a voluntary, method-ological choice (Bouaud et al, 1995), motivated bythe fact that these objects give rise to different in-ferences and must not be confused by the reason-ing component.
Additionally, in the target nor-malised conceptual representation, what consti-tutes the specific theme (in our conceptual model,the purported_oh j) of action 'angioplasty' mustbe precisely defined.
In the context of our appli-cation, 'angioplasty' acts on an artery_segment,a physical object corresponding to a part of anartery, which happens not to be comparable toany of the four preceding themes of 'angioplasty'.
2Therefore, all four examples (2)-(5) must be con-sidered as metonymies.1Segment, inour ontology, corresponds toa portionof space, not of matter.2Notice, though, that these types are stronglylinked (by relations other than IS-A) through theknowledge base models.
The semantic analyser pre-cisely recovers these links thanks to the mechanismpresented in this paper.To handle metonymy, Fass (1988) proposes amethod based on a list of alternations imple-mented as specific metonymy rules: Part_for-_Whole, Container-for_Contents, etc.
Sowa (1992)considers metonymies around the term "Prix Gon-court", originally introduced by Kayser (1988):this term undergoes different meaning shifts ineach of seven example sentences, ranging from theauthor who won the prize to the amount of moneyreceived.
Sowa discusses how background knowl-edge could help to process these metonymies,based on a knowledge description of what "PrixGoncourt" involves.In our system, the target conceptual representa-tion is defined by a domain model expressed withCGs.
This same model constitutes the resourcewhich enables the analyser to handle metonymies.We explain below how results similar to Puste-jovsky's type coercion may be obtained with amethod based on this domain model instead ofa qualia structure.3 Method3.1 RationaleThe input to the semantic analyser is the syntacticrepresentation f a sentence produced by a pre-vious large coverage syntactic analyser (B~rard-Dugourd et al, 1989).
This representation con-nects words, or predicates, with grammatical rela-tions such as subject, object, oblique object, mod-ifier, etc.
The output of the semantic analyser isa conceptual graph on which pragmatic inferencesare performed to enrich the representation.In the semantic lexicon, each word points to oneor more conceptual representations.
The gram-matical ink between two words in a sentence x-presses a conceptual link between their two associ-ated conceptual counterparts.
The task of the se-mantic analyser is to identify this conceptual link.Rather than including the knowledge needed forthis task in the semantic lexicon, or in a specificrule base, the program will examine the domainknowledge to resolve the link.
The method relieson a heuristic path search algorithm that exploitsthe graphic aspects of the conceptual graphs for-malism.3.2 Domain  knowledgeThe main domain knowledge lements consist ofthe domain ontology (Fig.
1) which is a subsump-tion hierarchy of concept ypes (henceforth simply'types') and of relation types, and of a set of ref-erence models attached to the main types.The reference model of a type represents knowl-edge about this type as a conceptual graph(Fig.
2).
Basically, a conceptual graph is a bi-partite graph with concept nodes (or concepts)labeled with a type plus an optional referent, andrelation nodes labeled with relation types (Cheinand Mugnier, 1992).

Predicates map to conceptualgraphs; most of them are reduced to one concept,since most of the words in the lexicon are techni-cal terms for which a type exists.
Figure 3 reportssome lexical entries.It is difficult to map grammatical relationsto static, predefined conceptual representations,since their meaning in the domain depends ontheir context of use, and mostly on the predi-cates they link.
Besides, one cannot think ofenvisioning all the possible uses of such a rela-tion, partly because of the use of metonymy.
Theconceptual representation f an actual grammat-ical link will therefore be computed ynamicallyby the semantic analyser using its context: thelinked predicates and domain knowledge.
How-ever, each grammatical relation may have concep-tual preferences for types or for conceptual rela-tions.
These preferences are associated with thegrammatical relation.
Our grammatical relationsinclude oblique complements, sothat prepositionsin our semantic lexicon are expressed under thissecond paradigm (Fig.
3).Ent ry  angioplastie-f is \[Angiopiasty: *x\].Ent ry  stenose_f is \[Stenosis: *x\].Entry  segment-iI_f is\[SegmentAh*x\]-(relative_to)-+\[Artery\](spatial.l"ole) +- \[Spatial_Object\]-+ (zone_of)-+ \[Artery ~egment\].Gram~natieal-rel  de- ?

It then en-deavours to link them, that is, to find a concept-level relation between their two head concepts C1and C2 that, first, is compatible with the semanticpreferences of grammaticM relation Gr, and, sec-ond, conforms to the representational c non madeof the reference models.3.4.1 Design principle.The basic idea is to project he two head con-cepts onto the domain knowledge and find aplausible concept-level relation between the two.We implement his by heuristic graph traversalthrough the reference models and the type hierar-chy, looking for a chain made of concepts and con-ceptual relations (i.e.
a linear conceptual graph),which could link concepts of the same types as C1and C2 and at the same time would satisfy theconceptual preferences of Gr.
Semantic analysisthen consists in solving recursively every gram-matical link starting from the sentence head pred-icate and then joining the obtained conceptualchains to build the conceptual representation fthe whole sentence.
We focus here only on thelink resolution algorithm.3.4.2 Chain product ion  methods.We consider that each predicate Pi is associatedwith the head concept Ci of a model Mi.
Let Tibe the type of Ci.
We also assume a partial order139on types.
We focus here only on the strategy fori)roducing the set of all possible chains between Cland C2.
Wc can use three methods of increasingcomplexity to find chains to link C1 and C2:1.
Concept fllsion: the two concepts may be re-dundant.If T1 < T2 or Tl > T2, then C, and 6'2 couldbe merged, and an empty chain is returned.2.
Concept inclusion: a concept may be "in-cluded" in the other's model.
(a) For every concept C' of type T' ill M1such that T' > T2, every path betweenCl and C' in Mt is a returned chain.
(b) For every concept C' of type T' in 3/&such that T' >_ Tt, (;very path in Mu be-tween C' and C9 is a returned chain.3.
Model join: two arbitrary concepts in the twocould be joined.For every pair of concepts (C\[, C~) where C~of type T" is in Mi, and such that T\[ < T.~or T\[ > T.~, all the paths Pathsl between C1and C~ in M, and Paths.2 between C~ and6'2 in \]1/\[2 are produced.
Then, for every pair(Pt,P'2) in Paths1 x Paths2, the chain madeof the two paths where last(p,) is joined tofirst(p.e) is returned.At this point, we are provided with all chains ex-tracted from the pair of models (MI, Me).3.4.3 Model identification.The models that associate knowledge to a givenpredicate P can be ranked according to their levelof generality.
The most specific model is the pred-icate definition in the semantic lexicon.
The nextone is the reference model associated with the typeT of the head concept of the definition.
Then, thefollowing models are the reference models inher-ited along the ontology through supertypes of T.As the type hierarchy is, in our system, a tree(Bouaud et al, 1995), the models for a predicateare strictly ordered.
Considering two grammati-cally linked predicates, the product of their mod-els constitutes as many model pairs that can bepotentially used to look for possible chains.
Suchpairs are structured by a partial order based onthe generality rank of their members, a3.4.4 Heuristic chain selection.At this stage, we are provided with all the pos-sibles chains between P1 and P2 extracted fromtheir models.
The remaining problem ix to choosetile most appropriate chain to substitute for Gr.After some experimentation, we chose the follow-ing scheme.
The best chain ix selected accord-ing to five heuristic criteria: (1) satisfiability ofaA model pair (To.
1, rn2) is more spe-cific than (rn\[, rn~) if max_rank(ml, m.~) is less thanmax_rank(m~, rn~), or if equal, rain_rank(m1, re.e) isless than min_rank(m~, m'2).Gr preferences; (2) most specific ,nodel pair, i.e.,the use of most specific knowledge associated withwords is prefered; (3) simplest chain productionmethod (see 3.4.2); (4) most specific or high-est priority of Gr preferences; (5) shorter chainlength.
When inultiple chains remain in competi-tion, one is selected randomly.To reduce search, tile link resolntion strategydoes not consider all possible chains, and imple-ments the first; two criteria directly in the chainproduction step.
Chains that violate Gr prefer-ences are discarded, and model pairs are exploredstarting fi'om the most specific pair.3.5 An exampleLet us illustrate the, resolution on example (2)(an angioplasty of segment II).
Tile inimt tripleis (angioplastie_f;de_f;segment_iI_f).
The corre-sponding types, Angioplasty and Segment_II,are not compatible and tile "fusion" inethod fails.The "inclusion" method also fails since no modelfor angioplastie_f includes a concept compatiblewith Segment_II, and no model for segment_ii_fincludes a concept compatible with Angioplasty.However, with the "join" method, the algorithmidentifies 6063 possible chains that satisfy thepreferences attached to preposition des  (Fig.
3).The selected chain uses the reference model ofAngioplasty  (Fig.
2) and tile definition graph forsegment/I_f (Fig.
3) which are connected on con-cept trtery~qegment.
The resulting conceptualrepresentation .joins the two corresponding paths:\[Angioplasty\]-* (purported-obj)-+\[A rt cry_Segment\].\[artery_Segment} ~--(zone_of)~--\[Spatial_O bjcct\]~ (spatial_role)-*\[Segment AI\],into\[Angioplasty\]-~ (purported-obj)-~\[Art cry_Segment 1~- (zone_of) ~- \[Spatial_Object\]-+ (spatial_role)--~\[Segment_I I\].This representation reflects the fact that in thecontext of an 'angioplasty', 'segment II' is consid-ered from the point of view of the physical arterysegment the angioplasty is to act upon (instead ofthe spatial notion Segment_II expresses).4 Implementat ion  and resu l tsThis analyser has been implemented on top of aconceptual graph processing package mbedded inCommon Lisp.
In the current state, the ontol-ogy contains about 1,800 types and 300 relationtypes; over 500 types have their own referencemodel; the lexicon defines over 1,000 predicatesand about 150 grammatical relations and prepo-sitions.
The analyser correctly handles typicalexpressions found in our texts, including exam-ples (2)-(5) (see table 1).
The complete process-ing chain has been tested on a set of 37 dischargesummaries (393 sentences, 5,715 words) (Zweigen-baum et ~1., 1995).

The semanticdefinition of ~t word is here the reference model ofits head concept ype; each relation path startingfi'om the head eon(:ept of this reference model issimilar to a qualia role, in that; it; describes one ofthe semantic facets or 1)ossible uses of the word.In the context of a predicate, one of the conceptsin the reference model is selected as the incoln-ing point of a link from the predicate's inealfingrepresentatk) n,The coneel)t-oriente, d domMmnlodel apl)roaehadvocated here hyI)othesizes that the behaviour ofwords is driven by their conceptuM ro|es in the do-main.
This has the advantage of factoring knowl-edge at the conceptual level, rather than havingto distribute it at the level of words.
This knowl-edge can then be shared by severM words.
Sharingeven o(:(:urs across languages (e. 9.
Dutch (Spynsand Willems, 1995)).Moreover, the type hierarchy Mlows concepts,hence words, to inherit reference models frommore M)stract (:olmepts, thus enabling more sitar-ing mM modularity.
The distinction between lo-cal information aim information inherited throughthe hierarchy in filrthermore xploited when rank-ing different chains between two concept ypes.Another differelme resi(tes in the way flexibilityis obtained, in \]hlstejovsky's coercion ine(:hanism(Pustejovsky, 1991), the argument's semantic typechanges for a semantic type found in one of itsqualia.
In a variant approach (Mineur and Buite-laar, 1995), a word has no a priori semantic type;it in selected at composition time among the typesfound in the qualia.
In our approach, the headconcept type associated with an argument doesnot change.
The chain found between this con-cept and the predicate's head concept only bringsforward internmdiate concepts and relations whichare aetualised in th(; presence of the I)re(ticate, andlead to a particular epresentation of their lnt?an-ing.
As a side-effect, his approach ix able to han-dle sentences like (6) (7):(6) dotm bought a h)ng nOV6`-I (Godard and ,layez,:\[993)(7) an aIlg'ioI)lasty of a sovere stenosisSince the modifier (long, sew',re) and the action(verb 'bought', noun 'angioplasty') require incom-patible types of the same noun (novel: event vsot)ject, stenosis: state vs object), tyl)e changingvia coercion cannot work on such sentences.
Thisprol)lein does not occur in our approach.Type coercion assumes that the t)redi(:ate drivessemantic eompositioll, and that the semantic rep-resentation of the argument inllst adapt to it.
In241our method, both predicate and argument canmake a step towards finding their semantic link.The resulting conceptual chain, as a whole, repre-sents both the specific facet of the argument whichis involved in the sentence and the conceptual roleit plays in the predicate.The preferences that grammatical relations as-sign to conceptual relations drive path selection,taking into account he specific syntactic ontextin which a semantic omposition is to occur.
Thisis crucial to let, e.g., prepositions, influence thechoice of the conceptual link and the resolution ofthe metonymy.6 ConclusionThe overall goal of the MENELAS text understand-ing system was to build a normalised conceptualrepresentation of the input text.
The  aim of se-mantic analysis, in this context, is to build a repre-sentation which conforms to a domain model.
Wetherefore xperimented how this domain modelcould help semantic analysis to go from the flex-ibility of natural anguage to a constrained con-ceptual representation, a typical problem encoun-tered being metonymy.
The approach presentedhere shows how this can be performed.
It hasbeen fully implemented, and used with a reason-able size knowledge base as a part of the MENELAStext understanding system.Metonymy processing is based on the domainmodel.
Provided a new domain and task, withthe corresponding domain model, this enables thegeneric method to adapt directly to this new do-main and give results that are specific to it.
Build-ing such a domain model is generally feasible insufficiently limited domains, typically, technicaldomains.
Much of the strength of the methodthen hinges on the quality of the domain model:the concept ype hierarchy and the attached ref-erence models must be built in a principled way(Bouand et al, 1995).ReferencesA.
