WurfelUniversity of WashingtonSeattle, WA 98195mwurfel@uw.eduAbstractIdentification of complex clinical phenotypesamong critically ill patients is a major chal-lenge in clinical research.
The overall researchgoal of our work is to develop automated ap-proaches that accurately identify critical illnessphenotypes to prevent the resource intensivemanual abstraction approach.
In this paper, wedescribe a text processing method that usesNatural Language Processing (NLP) and su-pervised text classification methods to identifypatients who are positive for Acute Lung Inju-ry (ALI) based on the information available infree-text chest x-ray reports.
To increase theclassification performance we enhanced thebaseline unigram representation with bigramand trigram features, enriched the n-gram fea-tures with assertion analysis, and applied sta-tistical feature selection.
We used 10-foldcross validation for evaluation and our bestperforming classifier achieved 81.70% preci-sion (positive predictive value), 75.59% recall(sensitivity), 78.53% f-score, 74.61% negativepredictive value, 76.80% specificity in identi-fying patients with ALI.1 IntroductionAcute lung injury (ALI) is a critical illness con-sisting of acute hypoxemic respiratory failurewith bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that is associ-ated with pulmonary and non-pulmonary riskfactors.
ALI and its more severe form, acute res-piratory distress syndrome (ARDS), represent amajor health problem with an estimated preva-lence of 7% of intensive care unit admissions(Rubenfeld et al 2005) for which the appropri-ate treatment is often instituted too late or not atall (Ferguson et al 2005; Rubenfeld et al2004).
Early detection of ALI syndrome is essen-tial for appropriate application of the only thera-peutic intervention demonstrated to improvemortality in ALI, lung protective ventilation(LPV).The identification of ALI requires recognitionof a precipitating cause, either due to direct lunginjury from trauma or pneumonia or secondary toanother insult such as sepsis, transfusion, or pan-creatitis.
The consensus criteria for ALI includethe presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates onchest radiograph, representing non-cardiac pul-monary edema as evidenced by the absence ofleft atrial hypertension (Pulmonary CapillaryWedge Pressure < 18 mmHg (2.4 kPa)) or ab-sence of clinical evidence of congestive heartfailure, and oxygenation impairment as definedby an arterial vs. inspired oxygen level ratio(PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg (40 kPa))  (Argitas etal., 1998; Dushianthan et al 2011; Ranieri et al2012).In this paper, we describe a text processingapproach to identify patients who are positive forALI based only on the free-text chest x-ray re-ports.2 Related WorkSeveral studies demonstrated the value of Natu-ral Language Processing (NLP) in a variety ofhealth care applications including phenotype ex-traction from electronic medical records (EMR)(Demner-Dushman et al 2009).
Within this do-main, chest x-ray reports have been widely stud-ied to extract different types of pneumonia (Tep-per et al 2013; Elkin et al 2008; Aronsky et al2001; Fiszman et al 2000).
Chest x-ray reportshave also been studied for ALI surveillance byother researchers.
Two of the prior studies reliedon rule-based keyword search approaches.
He-rasevich et al(2009) included a free text Boole-an query containing trigger words bilateral, infil-trate, and edema.
Azzam et al(2009) used amore extensive list of trigger words and phrasesto identify the presence of bilateral infiltrates and10ALI.
In another study, Solti et al(2009) repre-sented the content of chest x-ray reports usingcharacter n-grams and applied supervised classi-fication to identify chest x-ray reports consistentwith ALI.
In our work, different from prior re-search, we proposed a fully statistical approachwhere (1) the content of chest x-ray reports wasrepresented by token n-grams, (2) statistical fea-ture selection was applied to select the most in-formative features, and (3) assertion analysis wasused to enrich the n-gram features.
We also im-plemented Azzam et als approach based on theinformation available in their paper and used it asa baseline to compare performance results of ourapproach to theirs.3 MethodsThe overall architecture of our text processingapproach for ALI identification is illustrated inFigure 1.
In the following sections, we will de-scribe the main steps of the text processing ap-proach as well as the annotated chest x-ray cor-pus used in training and test.3.1 Chest X-ray CorporaTo develop the ALI extractor, we created a cor-pus composed of 1748 chest x-ray reports gener-ated for 629 patients (avg number of re-ports=2.78, min=1, max=3).
Subjects for thiscorpus were derived from a cohort of intensivecare unit (ICU) patients at Harborview MedicalCenter that has been described previously (Gla-van et al 2011).
We selected 629 subjects whomet the oxygenation criteria for ALI(PaO2/FiO2<300 mmHg) and then three con-secutive chest radiographs were pulled from theradiology database.
Three Critical Care Medicinespecialists reviewed the chest radiograph imagesfor each patient and annotated the radiographs asconsistent (positive) or not-consistent (negative)with ALI.
We assigned ALI status for each sub-ject based on the number of physician raters call-ing the chest radiographs consistent or not con-sistent with ALI.
Table 1 shows the number ofphysicians with agreement on the radiograph in-terpretation.
There were 254 patients in the posi-tive set (2 or more physicians agreeing on ALIpositive) and 375 patients in the negative set (2or more physicians agreeing on ALI negative).Table 1 includes the distribution of patients overthe positive and negative classes at differentagreement levels.
We will refer to this annotatedcorpus as the development set in the remainingof the paper.For validation, we used a second dataset gen-erated in a similar fashion to the developmentset.
We obtained chest radiographs for 55 sub-jects that were admitted to ICU and who met ox-ygenation criteria for ALI (1 radiograph and re-port per patient).
A specialized chest radiologistannotated each report for the presence of ALI.There were 21 patients in the positive set and 34in the negative set.
We will refer to this corpus asthe validation set in the remaining of the paper.The retrospective review of the reports in bothcorpora was approved by the University ofWashington Human Subjects Committee of Insti-tutional Review Board who waived the need forinformed consent.3.2 Pre-processing ?
Section and SentenceSegmentationAlthough radiology reports are in free text for-mat, they are somewhat structured in terms ofsections.
We used a statistical section segmenta-tion approach we previously built to identify theboundaries of the sections and their types in ourcorpus of chest x-ray reports (Tepper et al2012).
The section segmenter was trained andtested with a corpus of 100 annotated radiologyreports and produced 93% precision, 91% recalland 92% f-score (5-fold cross validation).R diologyReportsData ProcessorSections,SentencesRankedn-gramsALI Learner ALI PredictorTraininginstancesTestinstancesYes NoAssertion Cl ssifierFeature ExtractorAs ertioncl ssesTop n-gramsFigure 1 Overall system architecture of ALI ex-tractor.Annotation Agreement Patient CountALI positivepatients3 1472 107ALI negativepatients3 2052 170Table 1 Agreement levels11After identifying the report sections, we used theOpenNLP 1  sentence chunker to identify theboundaries of sentences in the section bodies.This pre-processing step identified 8,659 sec-tions and 15,890 sentences in 1,748 reports of thedevelopment set and 206 sections and 414 sen-tences in 55 reports of the validation set.
Weused the section information to filter out the sec-tions with clinician signatures (e.g., InterpretedBy, Contributing Physicians, Signed By).
Weused the sentences to extract the assertion valuesassociated with n-gram features as will be ex-plained in a later section.3.3 Feature SelectionRepresenting the information available in thefree-text chest x-ray reports as features is criticalin identifying patients with ALI.
In our represen-tation, we created one feature vector for eachpatient.
We used unigrams as the baseline repre-sentation.
In addition, we used bigrams and tri-grams as features.
We observed that the chest x-ray reports in our corpus are short and not rich interms of medical vocabulary usage.
Based on thisobservation, we decided not to include any medi-cal knowledge-based features such as UMLSconcepts or semantic types.
Table 2 summarizesthe number of distinct features for each featuretype used to represent the 1,748 radiology reportsfor 629 patients.As can be seen from the table, for bigrams andtrigrams, the feature set sizes is quite high.
Fea-ture selection algorithms have been successfullyapplied in text classification in order to improvethe classification accuracy (Wenqian et al2007).
In previous work, we applied statisticalfeature selection to the problem of pneumoniadetection from ICU reports (Bejan et al 2012).By significantly reducing the dimensionality ofthe feature space, they improved the efficiency ofthe pneumonia classifiers and provided a betterunderstanding of the data.We used statistical hypothesis testing to de-termine whether there is an association betweena given feature and the two categories of ourproblem (i.e, positive and negative ALI).
Specif-ically, we computed the ?2 statistics (Manning1 OpenNLP.
Available at: http://opennlp.apache.org/and Schutze, 1999) which generated an orderingof features in the training set.
We used 10-foldcross validation (development set) in our overallperformance evaluation.
Table 3 lists the top 15unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams ranked by ?2statistics in one of ten training sets we used inevaluation.
As can be observed from the table,many of the features are closely linked to ALI.Once the features were ranked and their corre-sponding threshold values (N) were established,we built a feature vector for each patient.
Specif-ically, given the subset of N relevant featuresextracted from the ranked list of features, weconsidered in the representation of a given pa-tient?s feature vector only the features from thesubset of relevant features that were also foundin the chest x-ray reports of the patient.
There-fore, the size of the feature space is equal to thesize of relevant features subset (N) whereas thelength of each feature vector will be at most thisvalue.3.4 Assertion AnalysisWe extended our n-gram representation with as-sertion analysis.
We built an assertion classifier(Bejan et al 2013) based on the annotated cor-pus of 2010 Integrating Biology and the Beside(i2b2) / Veteran?s Affairs (VA) NLP challenge(Uzuner et al 2011).
The 2010 i2b2/VA chal-lenge introduced assertion classification as aUnigram Bigram TrigramDiffuse diffuse lung opacities con-sistent withAtelectasis lung opacities diffuse lung opaci-tiesPulmonary pulmonary edema change in diffuseConsistent consistent with lung opacitiesconsistentEdema opacities consistent in diffuse lungAlveolar in diffuse with pulmonaryedemaOpacities diffuse bilateral consistent withpulmonaryDamage with pulmonary low lung volumesWorsening alveolar damage or alveolar damageDisease edema or pulmonary edemapneumoniaBilateral low lung diffuse lung dis-easeClear edema pneumonia edema pneumonianoSevere or alveolar diffuse bilateralopacitiesInjury lung disease lungs are clearBibasilar pulmonary opacities lung volumes withTable 3 Top 15 most informative unigrams, bigrams,and trigrams for ALI classification according to ?2statistics.Feature Type # of Distinct FeaturesUnigram (baseline) 1,926Bigram 10,190Trigram 17,798Table 2 Feature set sizes of the development set.12shared task, formulated such that each medicalconcept mentioned in a clinical report (e.g.,asthma) is associated with a specific assertioncategory (present, absent, conditional, hypothet-ical, possible, and not associated with the pa-tient).
We defined a set of novel features thatuses the syntactic information encoded in de-pendency trees in relation to special cue wordsfor these categories.
We also defined features tocapture the semantics of the assertion keywordsfound in the corpus and trained an SVM multi-class classifier with default parameter settings.Our assertion classifier outperformed the state-of-the-art results and achieved 79.96% macro-averaged F-measure and 94.23% micro-averagedF-measure on the i2b2/VA challenge test data.For each n-gram feature (e.g., pneumonia), weused the assertion classifier to determine whetherit is present or absent based on contextual infor-mation available in the sentence the feature ap-peared in (e.g., Feature: pneumonia, Sentence:There is no evidence of pneumonia, congestiveheart failure, or other acute process., Assertion:absent).
We added the identified assertion valueto the feature (e.g., pneumonia_absent).
The fre-quencies of each assertion type in our corpus arepresented in Table 4.
Because chest x-rays do notinclude family history, there were no instances ofnot associated with the patient.
We treated thethree assertion categories that express hedging(conditional, hypothetical, possible) as the pre-sent category.3.5 ClassificationFor our task of classifying ALI patients, wepicked the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algo-rithm due to its good performance in text classi-fication tasks (Berger et al 1996).
In our exper-iments, we used the MaxEnt implementation in amachine learning package called Mallet2.4 Results4.1 MetricsWe evaluated the performance by using precision(positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity),negative predictive value, specificity, f-score,and accuracy.
We used 10-fold cross validationto measure the performance of our classifiers onthe development set.
We evaluated the best per-forming classifier on the validation set.4.2 Experiments with Development SetWe designed three groups of experiments to ex-plore the effects of (1) different n-gram features,(2) feature selection, (3) assertion analysis offeatures on the classification of ALI patients.
Wedefined two baselines to compare the perfor-mance of our approaches.
In the first baseline,we implemented the Azzam et.
al.
?s rule-basedapproach (2009).
In the second baseline, we onlyrepresented the content of chest x-ray reportswith unigrams.4.3 N-gram ExperimentsTable 5 summarizes the performance of n-gramfeatures.
When compared to the baseline uni-gram representation, gradually adding bigrams(uni+bigram) and trigrams (uni+bi+trigram) tothe baseline increased the precision and specifici-ty by 4%.
Recall and NPV remained the same.Azzam et.
al.
?s rule-based baseline generatedhigher recall but lower precision when comparedto n-gram features.
The best f-score (64.45%)was achieved with the uni+bi+trigram represen-tation.4.4 Feature Selection ExperimentsTo understand the effect of large feature space onclassification performance, we studied how theperformance of our system evolves for variousthreshold values (N) on the different combina-tions of ?2 ranked unigram, bigram, and trigramfeatures.
Table 6 includes a subset of the resultswe collected for different values of N. As listed2 Mallet.

We applied assertion analysis to all800 features as well as only a small set of topranked 10?k (1?k?5) features which were ob-served to be closely related to ALI (e.g., diffuse,opacities, pulmonary edema).
We hypothesizedapplying assertion analysis would inform theclassifier on the presence and absence of thoseterms which would potentially decrease the falsepositive and negative counts.Table 7 summarizes the results of our experi-ments.
When we applied assertion analysis to all800 features, the performance slightly droppedwhen compared to the performance with no as-sertion analysis.
When assertion analysis appliedto only top ranked features, the best f-score per-formance was achieved with assertion analysiswith top 30 features; however, it was still slightlylower than the f-score with no assertion analysis.The differences are not statistically significant.4.6 Experiments with Validation SetWe used the validation set to explore the general-izability of the proposed approach.
To accom-plish this we run the best performing classifier(uni+bi+trigram at N=800) and two definedbaselines on the validation set.
We re-trained theuni+bi+trigram at N=800 classifier and unigrambaseline on the complete development set.Table 8 includes the performance results.
Thesecond baseline with unigrams performed thebest and Azzam et.
al.
?s baseline performed theworst in identifying the patients with ALI in thevalidation set.5 DiscussionOur best system achieved an f-score of 78.53(precision=81.70, recall=75.59) on the develop-ment set.
While the result is encouraging andsignificantly better than the f-score of a previous-ly published system (f-score=62.23, preci-sion=51.27, recall=79.13), there is still room forimprovement.There are several important limitations to ourcurrent development dataset.
First, the annotatorswho are pulmonary care specialists used only thex-ray images to annotate the patients.
However,the classifiers were trained based on the featuresextracted from the radiologists?
free-text inter-pretation of the x-ray images.
In one false posi-tive case, the radiologist has written ?Bilateraldiffuse opacities, consistent with pulmonaryedema.
Bibasilar atelectasis.?
in the chest x-rayreport, however all three pulmonary care special-ists annotated the case as negative based on theirinterpretation of images.
Because the report con-sisted of many very strong features indicative ofALI, our classifier falsely identified the patientas positive with a very high prediction probabil-ity 0.96.
Second, although three annotators anno-tated the development set, there was full agree-ment on 42.12% (107/254) of the positive pa-tients and 45.33% (170/375) of the negative pa-tients.
Table 9 includes the false positive andnegative statistics of the best performing classifi-er (uni+bi+trigrams at N=800).
As can be seenfrom the table, the classifier made more mistakeson patients where the annotator agreement wasnot perfect.
The classifier predicted 13 of the 28false positives and 23 of the 39 false negativeswith probabilities higher than 0.75.
When weinvestigated the reports of those 13 false posi-tives, we observed that the radiologists usedmany very strong ALI indicative features (e.g.,diffuse lung opacities, low lung volumes) to de-scribe the images.
On the contrary, radiologistsdid not use as many ALI indicative features inthe reports of 23 false negative cases.In our experiments on the development set, wedemonstrated the positive impact of statisticalfeature selection on the overall classification per-formance.
We achieved the best f-score, whenwe used only 2.67% (800/29,914) of the com-plete n-gram feature space.
We enriched thehighly ranked features with assertion analysis.However, unlike feature selection, assertionanalysis did not improve the overall perfor-mance.
To explore the reasons, we analyzed re-ports from our corpus and found out that the cur-rent six assertion classes (present, absent, condi-tional, hypothetical, possible) were not sufficientto capture true meaning in many cases.
For ex-ample, our assertion classifier assigned the classpresent to the bigram bibasilar opacities basedon the sentence ?There are bibasilar opacitiesthat are unchanged?.
Although present was thecorrect assignment for bibasilar opacities, themore important piece of information was thechange of state in bibasilar opacities for ALIdiagnosis.

In this way, the sequence of x-ray reportsis used not only to assess a patient?s health at amoment in time but also to monitor the change.We recently defined a schema to annotate changeof state for clinical events in chest x-ray reports(Vanderwende et al 2013).
We will use this an-notation schema to create an annotated corpusfor training models to enrich the assertion fea-tures for ALI classification.The results on the validation set revealed thatthe classification performance degraded signifi-cantly when training and test data do not comefrom the same dataset.
There are multiple rea-sons to this effect.
First, the two datasets had dif-ferent language characteristics.
Although bothdevelopment and validation sets included chestx-ray reports, only 2,488 of the 3,305 (75.28%)n-gram features extracted from the validation setoverlapped with the 29,914 n-gram features ex-tracted from the development set.
We suspectthat this is the main reason why our best per-forming classifier with feature selection trainedon the development set did not perform as wellas the unigram baseline on the validation set.Second, the validation set included only 55 pa-tients and each patient had only one chest x-rayreport unlike the development set where eachpatient had 2.78 reports on the average.
In otherwords, the classifiers trained on the developmentset with richer content made poor predictions onthe validation set with more restricted content.Third, because the number of patients in the val-idation set was too small, each false positive andnegative case had a huge impact on the overallperformance.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we described a text processing ap-proach to identify patients with ALI from theinformation available in their corresponding free-text chest x-ray reports.
To increase the classifi-cation performance, we (1) enhanced the base-line unigram representation with bigram and tri-gram features, (2) enriched the n-gram featureswith assertion analysis, and (3) applied statisticalfeature selection.
Our proposed methodology ofranking all the features using statistical hypothe-sis testing and selecting only the most relevantones for classification resulted in significantlyimproving the performance of a previous systemfor ALI identification.
The best performing clas-sifier achieved 81.70% precision (positive pre-dictive value), 75.59% recall (sensitivity),78.53% f-score, 74.61% negative predictive val-ue, 76.80% specificity in identifying patientswith ALI when using the uni+bi+trigram repre-sentation at N=800.
Our experiments showedthat assertion values did not improve the overallperformance.
For future work, we will work ondefining new semantic features that will enhancethe current assertion definition and capture thechange of important events in radiology reports.AcknowledgementsThe work is partly supported by the Institute ofTranslational Health Sciences (UL1TR000423),and Microsoft Research Connections.
