INTRODUCTIONSRA, although not a research contractor underTipster Phase II, nonetheless actively participated inthe program in a variety of ways.
Some of theactivities include:Preparation and distribution of the NamedEntity Tagging and Discourse TaggingTools for theSixth Message UnderstandingConference (MUC6) and Multilingual EntityTask (MET)Implementation / Award of two Tipsterapplication prototype systems: Bluesky andUSACOMSole contractor on two Tipster-affiliatedsystems, the Intelligence Analysts Associate(IAA) under funding from RomeLaboratories for NAIC, and the Overtureprogram for OIR.Participation in the Contractor ArchitectureWorking Group (CAWG)Participation in the Common PatternSpecification Language subgroupOur current activities include support for the dataextraction components ofthe ISX-led ISLE/InfoTechTipster application.II.
RESEARCH PROGRAMHIGHLIGHTSThe application of machine learningtechniques to reduce the customization timefor data extraction systemsThe use of multilingual data extraction fortargeted machine translation or gistingFusion of data extraction technology withother media (speech; video) for multimediafusion applicationslII.
EVALUATIONSSRA participated in the Sixth MessageUnderstanding Conference inthree of the four areas(Named Entity, Template Element, and ScenarioTemplate).
SRA participated in the MultilingualEntity Task (MET) in both Japanese and Spanish.IV.
PHASE III PLANSOn the research front, as a Tipster Phase IIIcontractor, SRA intends to make significant advancesin the customizability of extraction technology,primarily by bringing together our expertise inmachine learning and natural anguage processing.A second focus of our Phase III research plansinvolve the intelligent summarization of texts.Finally, we intend to continue to contribute to theContractor Architecture Working Group and othercommon efforts, and complete the Tipster applicationsystems.SRA engages in an active program of research andoperational support in both multilingual dataextraction, natural language processing moregenerally, and text retrieval integration.
