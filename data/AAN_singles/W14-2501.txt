Computational Explorations in How We SayWhat We Say, and Why It MattersLillian LeeCornell UniversityAbstractLouis Armstrong (is said to have) said, ?I don?t need words ?
it?s all in the phrasing?.
Assomeone who does natural-language processing for a living, I?m a big fan of words; but lately, mycollaborators and I have been studying aspects of phrasing (in the linguistic, rather than musicalsense) that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over another.
I?ll describe some ofthese projects in this talk.
The issues we?ll consider include: Does the way in which somethingis worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it is remembered or attracts attention, beyondits content or context?
Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their arguments,in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g., ?pro-choice?
vs.
?pro-life?)?
The settingswe?ll explore range from movie quotes that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on Facebook,Wikipedia, Twitter, and the arXiv; to framing in public discourse on the inclusion of genetically-modified organisms in food.Joint work with Lars Backstrom, Justin Cheng, Eunsol Choi, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,Jon Kleinberg, Bo Pang, Jennifer Spindel, and Chenhao Tan.ReferencesLars Backstrom, Jon Kleinberg, Lillian Lee, and Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil.
