The ProblemPhonological theory has undergone a number cfmore or less radical changes in recent years.
Mo-dels of non-linear epresentation f features, con-straints on the abstractness of rules, and theoriesof underspecification (imposing conditions on pos-sible underlying features and their values, avoidingredundancy) are all part of current phonologicalthinking.Considerations of the formalisms involved in thesetheories have not been pursued to a large extent.!',.
has become increasingly clear, however, thatdifferent representational formats lead to differen-ces in the formalisms required for phonologicalrules.
Recently, there have also been attempts toclarify the formal status of associations betweenelements cn different iers (Sagey 1988, Hammond19~8, Bird & Klein 1989).
This paper is an attemptto clarify some of the properties cf phonologicalrules and representations by applying the conceptsof unification formalisms to phonological theory.A crucial part of any unification-based phonologi-cal theory is the elimination of feature-changingrules from the list of possible rules in the frame-work.
Feature-changing rules stand in clear oppe-sitbn to the incremental, monotonic nature of uni-fication grammars.
In the following, it wilt beshown how a cLange of feature-values can beavoided for a rule which, first, is a regular phone--logical rule within any phonological theory thatallows for phonological rules at all, and which, se-cond, has always been formulated as a feature-changing rule (see literature from Kiparsky 1968to Rubach 1990).
t2 A standard analysis of German Final DevoieingThe rule in question is one of the classical exam-ples of a neutralization rule, namely the rule ofFinal Devoicing (Auslautverh~'rtung, FD for short)in the phonology of Standard German.
It neutrali-zes the phonemic ontrast between voiced and un-voiced obstruents in a particular position (namelysyllable-finally).
The standard view of this rule isthat it changes voiced obstruents in syllable-finalposition into their unvoiced counterparts.
Exam-ples are provided in (1), and a feature-changingversion of this rule is given in (2).
It is clear nowthat the relevant domain for the rule is the sylla-ble (see Vennemann 1978, Wiese 1988); dependingon the model of syllabic structure, the preciseformulation of the context description can vary,referring to the syllable edge as in (2) or to thefinal constituent of the syllablefl(i)Lo \ [p \ ]  - Lo \ [b \ ]esRaft\] - Ra\[d\]esSat\[k\] - S ir \ [g\]eakti\[f\] - akti\[v\]e'praise (nora.)'

Note that the rule changes the value of a fea-ture.
In the framework assumed, this is necessarilyso, since in the \[- sonorant\]-class, voicing is dis-tinctive, so that both /b /  and /p /  are assigned thisfeature.
(4) demonstrates that a different syllabifi-cation (due to suffixation) correctly prevents FDfrom applying.

Thefollowing considerations rely on some (fairly un-controversial) assumptions about phonological re-presentation.
First, in accordance with underspeci-fieation theory, it will be assumed that redundantfeature values are not present in underlying repre-sentations (lexical entries).
For the relevant seg-ments this means that the voiced obstruents aremarked as r+ voiced\], whereas unvoiced obstruentsare not marked for this feature.
General consider-ations of markedness upport this choice: Voice-less obstruents are more common, have a widerdistribution, are acquired earlier in language ac-quisition, etc.Secondly, all features, including those representinga segment, are represented in a non-linear, associ-ative way.
In particular, a hierarchical model ofthe segment in the version of McCarthy (1988: 105)is adopted.
In this particular version of a featurehierarchy, all nodes are characterized by the pre-sence of particular features that constitute thenode.
(5) is not quite complete, but allows the re-presentation of most natural classes of segments.
4(Conceivably, as argued by Goldsmith (1990: oh.6.2), under assumptions of underspecification ,thefeature hierarchy in (5) and in comparable propo-sals is too elaborate.
For the present purposes, theonly important assumption is that features andtheir values are organized hierarchically.
)We will interpret the feature hierarchy in (5) asan admissibility tree.
Features are only allowed ifthey enter the relations expressed in this tree.
Fur-thermore, the relations ("associations" in the termi-nology of non-linear phonology) are interpreted asbeing transitive.
The values of features are propa-gated (as instructions to the artiaulatory appara-tus) along the paths specified by the relations tothe root.
In (6), the feature tree (5) is receded intoa complex feature structure.
Every feature takesas a vMue either one of the terminals ("+" or "-")or another feature structure.
Associations are ex--pressed by a feature A with the interpretation fortile associations as just given.
(Different instancesreceive numerical indices.)
As a template for pos-sible segments, this structure does not contain theterminal values, i.e.
+ and -.
These values are de-noted by "\[\]% the empty feature structure, if unspe-cified.

We allow only the folio-wing types of formal operations:- insertion of associationsfi- deletion of associations ("delinking").The first operation generally occurs through unifi-cation.
Unification here is the combination of lexi-cal entries and regularities that are independentlymotivated and expressed as feature structures.
Theinformation in the feature structures is combined,leading to statements that particular relationshold.
In particular, the assignment of default va-lues for features is achieved through unifying thefeature structures that express the default valuewith representations for lexical entries that do notcontain a specified value for the respective fea-ture.
Dclinking, on the other hand, is not so readi-ly modeled with unificational means (as presentedby Shieber 1986 or Carlson & Linden 1987); it canbe seen, however, as the introduction of generaliz-,~tion ("the dual of unification", Shieber (1986: 64))into the theory.
Under generalization of two fea-ture strucures, only information contained in bothis kept; all other information is lost.
We will nowshow that using generalization alongside unificationallows us to state FD widmut the bvocation of afeature-changing rule.The typology of rules proposed here does not allowfeature values to be changed.
The treatment of FDin German, then, is the following.
Taking /d /  and/ t /as  examples, marking for \[voiced\] is expressedunderlyingly as in (7).
6 There exists a default rule(8) that in general (i. e., in the absence of otherprovisions) allows values for \[voiced\] to be identi-cal to the value for the feature \[sonorant\].
Thisrule uses feature reentrancy.
(Possibly, sonorancyitself is also underspecified, but this is left out ofconsideration here.)
Furthermore, there is no ruleof FD but a well-formedncss condition (9) whichexplicitly requires obstruents to be \[- voiced\] syl-lable-finally.
(8) and (9) are short-hand notationsfor the more complex formulations within the lea-ture structure.
The crucial step in the derivationof, say, R,~lt\], with an underly ing/d/ ,  is the gener-alization of the two feature structures (7a) and (9),with different values for \[voiced\].
As a result,\[voiced\] is unspecified.
(10) illustrates the steps inthe application of the various mechanisms leadingto the devoicing of /d / .
The apparent change inthe value vet \[voiced\] is possible because of gene-ralization, which removes a value, and the exis-tence of the default rule, which provides a value.(7)a.

L voiced:VS?n?rant:\[\]- m\] syllabification,- - sy l lab le  generalization with (9)c. Vsonorant:-  \ ] \ ]  default-rule,Lvoiced: - syllable unification with (8)It nmst be stressed that this proposal for the treat-ment of FD has one major advantage over the tra-ditional analysis: While it is clear that neutralizat-ion processes uch as FD always disallow the moremarked member of the pair in question, there isnothing in the formalism for the FD rule (2) thatwould formally disallow a rule that leads to themarked member of the pair.
This, however, is im-possible in the framework introduced here.
If awellformedness condition analogous to (9) wouldrequire a voiced obstruent syllable-finally, therewould not be a rule which could provide the value\[+ voiced\].
There simply is no rule comparable todefault rule (8).
In other words, neutralization for\[voiced\] can only lead to \[- voiced\] because thereis a well-motivated efault rule providing this va-lue.
In this sense, the solution in the frameworkgiven has a higher explanatory level than the onesoperating with a feature-changing rule, where bothtypes of change, from marked to unmarked andfrom unmarked to marked, are equally complex.4 ConclusionsThe relationship between phonology and computa-tional linguistics has various aspects.
On one le-vel, one might want to argue for a better treat-ment Of phonological knowledge in language-pro-cessing systems (see remarks in Wiese 1986).
Onanother level, it is instructive to observe howphonological theory can be shaped by explicitlycomputational considerations.Rules in non-linear phonology are to a large ex-tent not feature-changing, especially if underspeci-285fication theory is utilized as well.
This observationconstitutes additional motivation for the line ofreasoning in this paper.
We hope to have shown,first, that an analysis of FD without the invocationof a feature-changing rule is actually the preferredsolution.
Secondly, a large number of wel l -estab-lished rules, namely the members of the class ofneutralization rules, can be analysed as particularinstances of unification.However, the concept of generalization (as a form-al interpretation of delinking as this concept isstandardly used in non-linear phonology) cannot beavoided in an adequate treatment of these cases.It is in the very nature of neutralization that someinformation (here on the voicing of a consonant) isnot retained under specific circumstances.
In thatsense, phonological rule applications cannot con-stitute a strictly monotonic system, unless we arewilling to give up well-motivated linguistic gener-alizations.
Finally, we take side with Hammond(1988) on the question of how association lines areto be interpreted: transitivity is a crucial propertyof these relations, since the feature structures arehighly hierarchical.Future work in this area must also answer the ques-tion what principles determine and restrict the ap-plicability of generalization.
Generalization shouldnot be applicable whenever unification fails.
Butit seems to be in the nature of phonology that lin-guistic items can be realized even if they violatesome valid wellformedness conditions: Lexical en-tries in German end up being realized as wordsdespite the fact that they contain an underlyingvoiced obstruent which violates FD.
In numerousother cases, whole segments are deleted becausethey do not conform to phonotactic patterns or si-milar constraints.
It is in this area that unificationmust be supplemented with generalization.Footnotesi) Theories with only one level of description,especially in the work of Vennemann, provide themajor exception to this statement.2) Application of FD to recent Ioan words such asorange in (i) shows first that this rule is totallyproductive, and, secondly, that it is indeed appli-cable to all segments marked as \[- sonorant\].
Thenative stock of German words does not display aphoneme /3 / ,  but in orange this sound is readilydevoiced to / f / .3) Details of syllable structure are omitted, be-cause they are irrelevant for present purposes.4) The feature \[voiced\] used here in the descript-ion of FD is probably a short-hand notation fc~r aparticular configuration of the laryngeal states.
In(5) it is expressed as a particular configuration ofglottal states.5) This comes in two sub-eases: the spreading of afeature value to several nodes, as in the variousharmony and assimilation rules, and the linking ofa "floating" feature to a node.6) The markings in (7) hold for all occurrences of/d /and/ t / .
Here lies the difference to the clas-sical archiphonemie treatment of neutralization(Jakobson 1929, Trubetzkoy 1939), where an archi-phoneme /D/  is postulated only in the context ofneutralization.Referent'elBird, S. & E. Klein (1989) Phonological Events.
