(2013): An im-proved rest cost estimation together withan optimized strategy for obtaining the or-der in which the symbols of the cipher aredeciphered reduces the beam size neededto successfully decipher the Zodiac-408cipher from several million down to lessthan one hundred: The search effort is re-duced from several hours of computationtime to just a few seconds on a single CPU.These improvements allow us to success-fully decipher the second part of the fa-mous Beale cipher (see (Ward et al., 1885)and e.g.
(King, 1993)): Having 182 differ-ent cipher symbols while having a lengthof just 762 symbols, the decipherment isway more challenging than the decipher-ment of the previously deciphered Zodiac-408 cipher (length 408, 54 different sym-bols).
To the best of our knowledge, thiscipher has not been deciphered automati-cally before.1 IntroductionState-of-the-art statistical machine translation sys-tems use large amounts of parallel data to estimatetranslation models.
However, parallel corpora areexpensive and not available for every domain.Decipherment uses only monolingual data totrain a translation model: Improving the core deci-pherment algorithms is an important step for mak-ing decipherment techniques useful for trainingpractical machine translation systems.In this paper we present improvements to thebeam search algorithm for deciphering homo-phonic substitution ciphers as presented in Nuhnet al.
(2013).
We show significant improvementsin computation time on the Zodiac-408 cipher andshow the first decipherment of part two of theBeale ciphers.2 Related WorkRegarding the decipherment of 1:1 substitution ci-phers, various works have been published: Mostolder papers do not use a statistical approach andinstead define some heuristic measures for scoringcandidate decipherments.
Approaches like Hart(1994) and Olson (2007) use a dictionary to checkif a decipherment is useful.
Clark (1998) definesother suitability measures based on n-gram countsand presents a variety of optimization techniqueslike simulated annealing, genetic algorithms andtabu search.
On the other hand, statistical ap-proaches for 1:1 substitution ciphers are publishedin the natural language processing community:Ravi and Knight (2008) solve 1:1 substitution ci-phers optimally by formulating the deciphermentproblem as an integer linear program (ILP) whileCorlett and Penn (2010) solve the problem usingA?search.
Ravi and Knight (2011) report thefirst automatic decipherment of the Zodiac-408 ci-pher.
They use a combination of a 3-gram lan-guage model and a word dictionary.
As stated inthe previous section, this work can be seen as anextension of Nuhn et al.
(2013).
We will there-fore make heavy use of their definitions and ap-proaches, which we will summarize in Section 3.3 General FrameworkIn this Section we recap the beam search frame-work introduced in Nuhn et al.

Ve.3.2 Beam SearchThe main idea of (Nuhn et al., 2013) is to struc-ture all partial ?
?s into a search tree: If a ciphercontainsN unique symbols, then the search tree isof height N .
At each level a decision about the n-th symbol is made.
The leaves of the tree form fullhypotheses.
Instead of traversing the whole searchtree, beam search descents the tree top to bottomand only keeps the most promising candidates ateach level.
Practically, this is done by keepingtrack of all partial hypotheses in two arraysHsandHt.
During search all allowed extensions of thepartial hypotheses in Hsare generated, scored andput into Ht.
Here, the function EXT ORDER (seeSection 5) chooses which cipher symbol is usednext for extension, EXT LIMITS decides which ex-tensions are allowed, and SCORE (see Section 4)scores the new partial hypotheses.
PRUNE thenselects a subset of these hypotheses.
Afterwardsthe array Htis copied to Hsand the search pro-cess continues with the updated arrayHs.
Figure 1shows the general algorithm.4 Score EstimationThe score estimation function is crucial to thesearch procedure: It predicts how good or bad apartial cipher function ?might become, and there-fore, whether it?s worth to keep it or not.To illustrate how we can calculate these scores,we will use the following example with vocabular-ies Vf= {A,B,C,D}, Ve= {a, b, c, d}, exten-sion order (B,C,A,D), and cipher text1?

This paper im-proves the functions SCORE and EXT ORDER.and partial hypothesis ?
= {(A, a), (B, b)}.
Thisyields the following partial decipherment?
(fN1) = $ ab.. .ab.
.a.. ab.. $The score estimation function can only use thispartial decipherment to calculate the hypothesis?score, since there are not yet any decisions madeabout the other positions.4.1 BaselineNuhn et al.
(2013) present a very simple restcost estimator, which calculates the hypothesis?score based only on fully deciphered n-grams, i.e.those parts of the partial decipherment that form acontiguous chunk of n deciphered symbols.
Forall other n-grams containing not yet decipheredsymbols, a trivial estimate of probability 1 is as-sumed, making it an admissible heuristic.
For theabove example, this baseline yields the probabilityp(a|$) ?

p(b|a) ?

Themore symbols are fixed, the more contiguous n-grams become available.
While being easy and ef-ficient to compute, it can be seen that for examplethe single ?a?
is not involved in the computation of1765the score at all.
In practical decipherment, like e.g.the Zodiac-408 cipher, this forms a real problem:While making the first decisions?i.e.
traversingthe first levels of the search tree?only very fewterms actually contribute to the score estimation,and thus only give a very coarse score.
This makesthe beam search ?blind?
when not many symbolsare deciphered yet.
This is the reason, why Nuhnet al.
(2013) need a large beam size of several mil-lion hypotheses in order to not lose the right hy-pothesis during the first steps of the search.4.2 Improved Rest Cost EstimationThe rest cost estimator we present in this papersolves the problem mentioned in the previous sec-tion by also including lower order n-grams: In theexample mentioned before, we would also includeunigram scores into the rest cost estimate, yieldinga score of p(a|$)?p(b|a)?13?p(a)?p(b|a)?12?p(a)12?p(a) ?
p(b|a) ?

Note that this is not a simple lin-ear interpolation of different n-gram trivial scores:Each symbol is scored only using the maximumamount of context available.
This heuristic is non-admissible, since an increased amount of contextcan always lower the probabilty of some symbols.However, experiments show that this score estima-tion function works great.5 Extension OrderBesides having a generally good scoring function,also the order in which decisions about the ciphersymbols are made is important for obtaining reli-able cost estimates.
Generally speaking we wantan extension order that produces partial decipher-ments that contain useful information to decidewhether a hypothesis is worth being kept or notas early as possible.It is also clear that the choice of a good ex-tension order is dependent on the score estima-tion function SCORE.
After presenting the previ-ous state of the art, we introduce a new extensionorder optimized to work together with our previ-ously introduced rest cost estimator.5.1 BaselineIn (Nuhn et al., 2013), two strategies are pre-sented: One which at each step chooses the mostfrequent remaining cipher symbol, and another,which greedily chooses the next symbol to max-imize the number of contiguously fixed n-gramsin the ciphertext.LM orderPerplexityZodiac-408 Beale Pt.

The language model was trained onthe English Gigaword corpus.5.2 Improved Extension OrderEach partial mapping ?
defines a partial decipher-ment.
We want to choose an extension order suchthat all possible partial decipherments followingthis extension order are as informative as possible:Due to that, we can only use information aboutwhich symbols will be deciphered, not their actualdecipherment.
Since our heuristic is based on n-grams of different orders, it seems natural to evalu-ate an extension order by counting how many con-tiguously deciphered n-grams are available: Ournew strategy tries to find an extension order op-timizing the weighted sum of contiguously deci-phered n-gram counts2N?n=1wn?#n.Here n is the n-gram order, wnthe weight for or-der n, and #nthe number of positions whose max-imum context is of size n.We perform a beam search over all possibleenumerations of the cipher vocabulary: We startwith fixing only the first symbol to decipher.
Wethen continue with the second symbol and evalu-ate all resulting extension orders of length 2.
Inour experiments, we prune these candidates to the100 best ones and continue with length 3, and soon.Suitable values for the weights wnhave to bechosen.
We try different weights for the different2If two partial extension orders have the same score afterfixing n symbols, we fall back to comparing the scores ofthe partial extension orders after fixing only the first n ?

Here we show a relabeled version of the ci-pher, which encodes knowledge of the gold decipherment to assign reasonable names to all homophones.The original cipher just consists of numbers.orders on the Zodiac-408 cipher with just a beamsize of 26.
With such a small beam size, the exten-sion order plays a crucial role for a successful de-cipherment: Depending on the choice of the differ-ent weights wnwe can observe decipherment runswith 3 out of 54 correct mappings, up to 52 outof 54 mappings correct.
Even though the choiceof weights is somewhat arbitrary, we can see thatgenerally giving higher weights to higher n-gramorders yields better results.We use the weights w81=(0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) for thefollowing experiments.
It is interesting to com-pare these weights to the perplexities of thecorrect decipherment measured using differentn-gram orders (Table 5).
However, at this pointwe do not see any obvious connection betweenperplexities and weights wn, and leave this as afurther research direction.6 Experimental Evaluation6.1 Zodiac CipherUsing our new algorithm we are able to decipherthe Zodiac-408 with just a beam size of 26 and alanguage model order of size 8.
By keeping trackof the gold hypothesis while performing the beamsearch, we can see that the gold decipherment in-deed always remains within the top 26 scoring hy-potheses.
Our new algorithm is able to decipherthe Zodiac-408 cipher in less than 10s on a sin-gle CPU, as compared to 48h of CPU time usingthe previously published heuristic, which requireda beam size of several million.
Solving a cipherwith such a small beam size can be seen as ?read-ing off the solution?.6.2 Beale CipherWe apply our algorithm to the second part of theBeale ciphers with a 8-gram language model.Compared to the Zodiac-408, which has length408 while having 54 different symbols (7.55 ob-servations per symbol), part two of the Beale ci-phers has length 762 while having 182 differentsymbols (4.18 observations per symbol).
Com-pared to the Zodiac-408, this is both, in terms ofredundancy, as well as in size of search space, away more difficult cipher to break.Here we run our algorithm with a beam size of10M and achieve a decipherment accuracy of 157out of 185 symbols correct yielding a symbol errorrate of less than 5.4%.
The gold decipherment ispruned out of the beam after 35 symbols have beenfixed.We also ran our algorithm on the other partsof the Beale ciphers: The first part has a length520 and contains 299 different cipher symbols(1.74 observations per symbol), while part threehas length 618 and has 264 symbols which is2.34 observations per mapping.
However, our al-gorithm does not yield any reasonable decipher-ments.
Since length and number of symbols indi-cate that deciphering these ciphers is again moredifficult than for part two, it is not clear whetherthe other parts are not a homophonic substitutioncipher at all, or whether our algorithm is still notgood enough to find the correct decipherment.7 ConclusionWe presented two extensions to the beam searchmethod presented in (Nuhn et al., 2012), that re-duce the search effort to decipher the Zodiac-408enormously.
These improvements allow us to au-tomatically decipher part two of the Beale ciphers.To the best of our knowledge, this has not been1767done before.
This algorithm might prove usefulwhen applied to word substitution ciphers and tolearning translations from monolingual data.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Mark Kozek from the Depart-ment of Mathematics at Whittier College for chal-lenging us with a homophonic cipher he created.Working on his cipher led to developing the meth-ods presented in this paper.ReferencesAndrew J.
