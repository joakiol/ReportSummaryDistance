Proceedings of SIGDIAL 2010: the 11th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, page 17,The University of Tokyo, September 24-25, 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsInvited TalkDynamic Adaptation in Dialog SystemsMarilyn WalkerUniversity of California, Santa CruzA hallmark of human robust intelligence is the ability to flexibly and dynami-cally adapt behavior to the current situation.
For dialog behavior, this entails adap-tation to features of both the dialog partner (e.g., relationship, age, personality) andthe dialog situation (e.g., task context, asynchronous interaction, limited modalitiessuch as voice-only communication).
We don?t completely understand how humansdo this, nor do we have the ability to produce such dynamically adaptable behaviorin human computer dialog interaction.
In this talk I will discuss our recent work ondynamic adaptation to the user, and present some experimental results showing thatit is possible to automatically generate both verbal and nonverbal system behaviorsthat are perceived by the user as reliably expressing particular system personalities.I will describe two of my current projects at UCSC that are integrating these ca-pabilities into mobile dialogue systems: SpyFeet, a role playing augmented realitygame for encouraging girls to exercise, and Skipper, a dialogue system that givespedestrians directions in both urban and campus environments.17
