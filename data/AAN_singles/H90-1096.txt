A Real-Time Spoken-Language SystemInteractive Problem-SolvingPatt i  Price and Robert  C. MooreSRI Internat ionalforObjective:SRI is developing a system to improve complex problem-solving through tile use of interactive spoken language inconjunction with other media.
This requires real-timeperformance, large vocabulary, high semantic accuracyand habitability, as well as robustness to expected andunexpected variability.
SRI's spoken-language system isbeing developed in the air travel planning domain alongtwo overlapping research and development lines, one fo-cussed on an SLS kernel for database query, and tileother on the full interactive system.Recent  Accompl i shments?
Improved natural language understanding in the airtravel planning domain (about 90% of a test-set of319 sentences collected at T1 now parse, 64% re-ceive a semantic interpretation, over 25% retrievethe correct answer from the database.?
Implemented corrective training to improve recogni-tion performance; on the standard training set thisimproves peaker-independent perplexity 60 perfor-mance from 6.7% error to 5.1% error, and for alarger training set (about 11,000 sentences), im-proves speaker-independent recognition from 5.3%error to 4.1% error.?
Evaluated the effects on performance oflarger train-ing sets: using about 11,000 training sentences com-pared to about 4000 training sentences improvesfrom 6.7% error to 5.3% error.?
Started initial experiments in consistency modeling:showed significant improvement for separate model-ing of male and female speech for both the standardand the large training sets (performance improvesfrom 6.7e~ error to 5.7% error on the standard train-ing and from 5.3% error to 4.3% error on the largetraining set).
Speaker- independent perplexity 60performance can be expected to improve still fur-ther when gender-specific modeling with correctivetraining on large data sets is implemented.?
Started implementing procedures for porting to newvocabularies, including the ATIS vocabulary, in-cluding the automatic generation of baseforms, ap-plications of rules and the creation of word-modelsbased on existing training data from other domains(currently about 9000 verified words are i, the dic-tionary and another 20,000 from tile Brown corpusmost frequent words in process).Incorporated in the SRI Speech Understanding Sys-tem techniques (developed under all NSF contract)that use statistical information about ile speech sig-nal to improve recognition accuracy in noisy envi-ronments; started the real-time implementation fthese algorithms.Started port of phonology software from LISP toC, and demonstrated performance improvementthrough the use of more detailed, statisticallytrained phonological models.With help from TI, implemented a functional equiv-alent of the TI data-collection mechanism; collectedand transcribed ata from 10 subjects using theTI protocols.
Designed experiments for variationson this mechanism and started data collection andanalysis.P lans.
Continue ATIS development.
* Expand effort in consistency modeling and trainingon larger data sets.
* Continue development of software for easy portingto new vocabularies.?
Begin effort to detect out-of-vocabulary items anddesign and evaluate an appropriate interface.?
Collect and analyze more human-machine data un-der various conditions in order to guide the designand evaluation of the SRI SLS.424
