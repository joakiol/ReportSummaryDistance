upenn,  edu1 IntroductionScrambling, both local and long-distance, has recentlyattracted considerable attention among linguists andcomputational linguists.
In this paper, we will ex-plore the adequacy of the Tree Adjoining Gram-mar (TAG) formalism for dealing with long-distancescrambling I in German.
We will show that TAGscannot capture the full range of constructions derivedby scrambling.
I\[owever, Multi-Component TAGs(MC-TAG), an extension of TAGs introduced earlier\[Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988\] and utilized for linguistic pur-poses (e.g.
for extraposition \[Kroch and Joshi 1986\]),can indeed capture the full range of constructions de-rived by scrambling.
We will also present an ID/LPvariant of TAG to capture the same constructions, andthen comment on the relationship between the two sys-tems.2 Some Linguistic DataA striking feature of scrambling is its freedom: thereappear to be no systematic syntactic restrictions onthe number of verbal arguments hat undergo "move-ment," nor on the distances over which they maymove 3.
Thus, any ordering of the arguments from allclauses is possible.
To illustrate this freedom we willpresent wo additional examples in which scramblingof a more complex nature occurs.1.
More than one constituent may undergo movementinto higher clauses.
The scrambled constituents neednot retain their original relative order to each other af-ter scrambling.
In sentence (2b), two NPs are scram-bled out of the embedded clause into the top-levelc lause.2.
Constituents may be moved over an unboundednumber of clauses.
In sentence (3b), NP die Witwenhas been moved into its immediately dominatingclause, while NP der Opfer has been moved from themost deeply embedded clause into the top-level clause,beyond the intermediate clause.In German (and in many other SOV languages, uchas Korean, Ilindi and Japanese), a constituent of anembedded clause may be moved from that clause intothe matrix clause.
Consider, for example, sentences (1)in Figure 1.
In German, the object of the embeddedclause can be "moved "2 to any position in the matrixclause, as in sentences (lb) and (lc).

Infact, analyses have been proposed (going back to \[Evers 1975J}bMid on a proctms of "ver\[~ cluster formatlon , which avoidinter-clausal movement altogether.
However, since embeddingis recursive, the verb clusters ca,mot all be listed in the lexicon.Ilence, from a formal point of view, a lexical or morphologicalanalysis of verb cluster formation poses exactly the same prob-lems as scrambling interpreted as syntactic movement.3 A TAG AnalysisThe TAG formalism (for a recent introduction, see\[Joshi 1987a\]) is well suited for linguistic descriptionbecause (1) it provides alarger domain of locality thana CFG or other augmented CFG-based formalismssuch as tlPSG or LFG, and (2) it allows factoring ofrecursion from the domain of dependencies.
This ex-tended omain of locality, provided by the elementarytrees of TAG, allows us to "lexicalize" a TAG gram-mar: we can associate ach tree in a grammar with alexical item \[Schabes t al 1988, Schabes 1990\] 4.
Thetree will contain the lexical item, and all of its syntac-3Some verbs allow scrambling out of their Complementsmore freely than others.
It appears that all subject-controlverbs and most object-control verbs governing the dative al-low scrambling fairly f~ely, while scrambling with object-control verbs governing the accusative is more restr icted (cir.\[Bayer and Kornfilt 1989\]).
FYom a formal point of view, theserestrictions are not relevant for the present argument.4 The associated lexical item is called the anchort and is eitherthe head or the functional head of the tree.-21  -(la) ...daft ichl dem Kunden \[PROi den Kiihlsehrank.

As has been shown previously, certainlong-distance phenomena such as topicalization andwh-movement can be handled naturally within TAG\[Kroch and Joshi 1985\].
Ilere, "naturally" means thatdependencies are stated within the larger domain of lo-cality (the elementary tree), i.e., each clausal tree stillcontains a verb and all of its arguments.
Thus, in alexicalized TAG, the effects of long-distance movementare achieved by adjunction.
The word order freedompossible in the context of unconstrained scrambling,however, eludes the scope of TAGs.
In this section, wewill informally argue this formal result.By an argument very similar to Shieber's argumentfor Swiss German \[Shieber 1985\], it can b'e shown thatthe string language of scrambled High German is nota context-free language.
However, the linguistic factsof German do not allow an extension of the argu-ment: we cannot show that the string language is nota Tree Adjoining Language.
From a linguistic perspec-tive, the existence of some grammar that generates thestring language of German scrambling is not in itselfof much interest.
For examl)le ~if we define a TAGgrammar that generates the strings of scrambled Ger-man in which, however, some trees pair a verb withtile arguments of some other verb, then we have notadequately described the linguistic facts.
We are reallyonly interested in linguistically motivated grammars,namely those that exploit the extended omain of lo-cality and whose trees obey tile constraint of contain-ing a lexical item and all of its syntactic dependents(and nothing else).
We will refer to such restrictionsas "co-occurrence onstraints".
We can show that noTAG meeting the co-occurrence onstraints can gener-ate the sentences ofGerman scrambling.
We will arguethis point in two complementary ways.
First, we willconsider the ease of clauses with two overt nominal ar-guments.
Then, we will consider the case of clauseswith one overt nominal argument.In the first case, the verb of the embedded clausesubcategorizes for three NPs, one of which is anempty subject (PRO).
There is no verb in Ger-man that subcategorizes for three NPs and anS,  so in this case a recursively embedded struc-ture is impossible, and we have only one levelof embedding.
We show that the language{a(NP~, NP~,NP~,NP~)V~VI \[ a a permutation}- 22  -cannot be generated by a TAG that contains only ele-mentary trees obeying the co-occurrence r straints.
Alinguistically plausible set of two such trees is shown inFigure 2.
Consider the string NP~NP~ NP~NP~V~VI,which corresponds to the ordering in sentence (2b).
Itcan easily be seen that this string cannot be generatedby a TAG of the specified sort: after an adjunct,on theyield of the adjoined tree is segmented into at most twosections, while the yield of both trees would need to besegmented into three sections in order to be composedinto the desired string.~: SNPI $NP I veNP~ S V tSNP~ SNP / 8NP VPI /b ,,.o i,; i.; v,Figure 2: Initial trees with two verbal argumentsIn the second case, the verbs of the embedded clausessubcategorize for two NPs, one of which is again anempty subject (PH.O), and an S. We will argue thatthe language {a(NPt,..., gPk)Vk... I/1 I k E N and cra permutation} cannot be generated by a TAG whichobeys the co-occurrence constraints, i.e., whose ele-mentary trees have only two (non-vacuous) terminalleaves, NPi and ~5.
The idea in selecting this lan-guage is as follows: we keep the verbs at the end inthe inverted order required by embedding, and thenconsider all possible permutations of the NPs.
Fork _< 4 TAGs that generate the possible permuta-tions can be constructed; for k = 4 the construc-tion is not obvious, but we will not give the detailshere.
However, for k = 5 it is impossible.
Con-sider the string w = NP3NP1NP~ NP2 NP4 V5 V4 Va V2 I/i.For this string, it can be shown that it is impossibleto construct a TAG which meets the co-occurrenceconstraints discussed above and that generates thestring.
The proof is fairly involved; for details, see\[Becker and Itambow 1990\].In deciding whether scrambling as a linguistic phe-nomenon can adequately be described by a TAG ora TAG-equivalent formalism, it is crucial to decide5Note that the indices are not actua| ly part  of the alpha-bet over wliich we have deft,led the langoage, wlfich is simply{NP, V}.
The indlces oldy serve the pt*rpo~e of indicating wlllchterminals axe supposed to be col,tributcd by which tree, exploit-ing the co-occurrence constraints.whether or not sentences corresponding to the stringsgiven above are indeed grammatical.
In the case of theembedded two-argument clauses, examples are readilyavailable, as in sentences (2a) and (2b).
In the case ofthe embedded one-argument sentences, it is more diffi-cult (but not impossible) to construct an adequate x-ample because of the great depth of embedding.
How-ever, one might argue that there is a limit on the num-ber of clauses over which a scrambled NP may move.If this were true, the number of resulting structureswould be finite, so that they could be handled triv-ially by simple formalisms.
Sentences (3a) and (3b)show scrambled NPs can move over two clauses, andwe know of no evidence that convincingly establishessuch a limit for higher numbers.
The reluctance thatsome native speakers how to accept the more com-plex sentences i due mainly to processing difficulties,rather than to tim ungrammaticality of the sentences.A similar phenomenon occurs when native speakers re-ject multiply center-embedded sentences as "ungram-matical".In summary, long-distance scrambling provides lin-guistic evidence that shows that scrambling is beyondthe formal generative capacity of TAGs.
In the nexttwo sections, we will investigate two ways of extendingthe TAG formalism in order to achieve the necessarypower.
In the first approach, we will relax the imme-diate dominance relation of the elementary trees.
Inthe second approach, we will relax the linear prece-dence relations of the elementary trees.
In both cases,our concern will be to preserve the key properties of'FAGs, namely their extended omain of locality, andthe factoring of recurs,on from dependencies.4 A Mult i-Component TAG(MC-TAG) Approach: Re-laxed IDOne approach is to relax the ID (Immediate Domi-nance) relation within one elementary tree.
Even ina standard TAG, the ID relation between a motherand a daughter node is not necessarily an immediatedominance relation because of the possibility of ad-joining another tree at the daughter node.
We pro-pose to relax some of the ID relations of the auxiliarytree when it is adjoined.
This can be seen as splittingup tile auxiliary tree into parts, while still keeping adominance constraint between the parts.
As we willshow, such a splitting of the elementary trees, interest-ingly, leads to a previously defined extension of TAGs:namely, that of Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAG)- 23  -\[Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988\].
6As shown in Section 3, a TAG meeting theco-occurrence constraints cannot derive the stringNP~NpINP~NP21V2VI.
It is obvious that in orderto get this variation from the trees in Figure 2, theyield of the adjoined tree/~ has to be broken up intothree segments, which means that/~ has to be brokenup into two parts that are then adjoined to differentnodes of a.
This is exactly what relaxation of the IDrelation can achieve.
If the tree/~ in Figure 2 is splitat the interior S node, i.e.
by relaxing the ID relationbetween the two S nodes, we can construct a pair ofauxiliary trees as shown in Figure 3, where the dashedline indicates a dominance relation.e Ne I S V~Figure 3: Splitting an elementary tree into two parts.$.... ..../ \NP VPPROFigure 4: Adjunction of an MC-TAG tree setSets of trees are exactly what the MC-TAG formal-ism introduces.
In an MC-TAG, instead of auxiliarytrees being single trees we have auxiliary sets, a setcontaining more than one (but still a fixed number)oMC-TAGs have already beenused by Kroch and Joshi\[Kroch and Joshi 1986\] for the analysis of extraposition.
It isinteresting to note that  the additional requirement that  the footnode of one of the components ofan auxiliary set dominate theroot node of tile other component i. tile same auxiliva'y set wasalso used by them.of auxiliary trees.
For details of tile definition of MC-TAG see \[Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988\].
In an MC-TAG,adjunction is defined as the simultaneous adjunctionof all trees in a set to different nodes.
It is not possi-ble to adjoin trees from the same set into each other.Thus, we can interpret TAGs with relaxed dominanceas MC-TAGs, by identifying subtrees containing onlyID relations with trees in an MC-TAG tree set.
How-ever, we need to introduce an additional constraint:the foot node of the first tree (~1) in the tree set ofFigure 3 has to dominate the root node of the secondtree (~z) after adjoining the tree set.
This is indicatedby the dashed link between the foot node of ~1 andthe root node of/~2.
For example, Figure 4 shows theeffect of adjoining the tree set of Figure 3 into tree(~ of Figure 2, which yields the ordering of scrambledsentence (2b), NP~ZNpINP~NP2tV2VI.7In defining adjunction for MC-TAGs, an issue arisestha?
is irrelevant in the case of simple TAGs: dowe restrict adjunction in such a way that membersof a tree set must be adjoined into the trees of anelementary tree set, or do we allow adjunction intoderived tree sets as well?
With the restricted efini-tion of adjunction (called "local MC-TAG"), MC-TAGhas been shown to have a slightly greater generativepower than TAG; however, local MC-TAGs still be-long to the class of Mildly Context Sensitive Gram-mar formalisms (MCSG).
Weir \[Weir 1988\] has alsoshown that MC-TAGs are equivalent o the LinearContext Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), which arethe best known characterization f the MCSG formal-ism (though they are not an exhaustive characteriza-tion of MCSG).
In particular, we know that local MC-TAGs are polynomially parsabie.
However, it can beshown that local MC-TAGs are not adequate for de-riving all possible scrambled sentences in German (fora detailed discussion, see \[Becker and Rainbow 1990\]).In fact, no LCFILS is powerful enough to capturescrambling.
It is obvious that MC-TAG with the moreliberal definition of adjunction (called "nonlocal MC-TAG") can produce all the possible versions of scram-bled embedded sentences for any level of embedding.However, nonlocal MC-TAG has not yet been stud-ied in detail, and it is currently not known whethernonlocal MC-TAGs are polynomially parsable.7This part icular  example can be derived wi th  a weaker for-msdism; the point of  tile examp..ie is merely to illustrate theproposed formalism.
It can easdy be seen how it can handlescrambling from arbitrary levels of embedding.- 24  -$ A Free-Order  Approach:  t te -laxed  LPAn alternative formalism, which we will call FO-TAG(Free Order TAG), is closely based on the LD/LP-TAG framework presented in \[Joshi 1987b\].
As doesan LD/LP-TAG grammar, a FO-TAG grammar con-sists of a set of elementary structures.
Each elemen-tary structure is a pair consisting of one linear dom-inance (LD) structure (i.e., an unordered tree) andcorresponding LP rules.
The LD structure (which will,imprecisely, be referred to as a "tree" in this paper) iseither an initial or an auxiliary structure.
The LP rulesmay relate any two nodes of the tree unless one linearlydominates the other, ttowever, these precedence rulescan only be stated with respect to the nodes of anelementary tree; it is impossible to relate nodes in dif-ferent trees.
When an auxiliary tree fl is adjoined intoan initial tree et, the nodes of fl are not ordered withrespect o the nodes of a.
However, even in languageswith relatively free word order there are restrictions onmovement.
In order to capture these, we introduce twolinguistically motivated constraints, the integrity con-straint and the inheritance constraint.
The integrityconstraint, written A, allows us to express the factthat German does not allow scrambling into or outof certain constituents, uch as NPs and CPs (tensedclauses).
If we have AX for some node X,  then anynode which is not in the subtree rooted at X and whichdoes not dominate X must either precede or follow ev-ery node in the subtree rooted in X.
The inheritanceconstraint, written $, forces inheritance and allows usto capture the clause-final position of the verb in Ger-man.
If we have $X for a node X, then when the treeof which X is a node is adjoined into another tree atnode A, X inherits all LP rules specified for A.As an example, consider sentences (2a) and (2b) givenin Section 2.
The initial trees along with the LP rulesand constraints are shown in Figure 5.
Adjunctionyields the structure shown in Figure 6.
Note that onlyone of the possible orderings of the nodes, correspond-ing to sentence (2b), is shown.S b < V~NP~ < V, NP~ < V 2sb t vj P .o  ANt I ANP 1 S V 2Figure 5: The initial trees in the FO-TAG formalism.It is easy to sce that FO-TAG can generate all scram-bled configurations, while obeying' the co-occurrence5 NP~ < S 2NP~ <S 2S 2 <V~<v dll : < v dNP~ < V !NPI <v,<A PIFigure 6: Sentence (2b) in FO-TAGconstraint.
As in the case of nonlocai MC-TAGs, it isimmediately obvious that FO-TAG is not an LCFRS;the question of polynomial parsability remains open,as does the question of the generative power of FO-TAG.
We are currently investigating these issues.From a linguistic point of view, it is interesting thatthe same linguistic phenomenon can be handled bytwo very different formalisms.
Scrambling is currentlyattracting much attention from syntacticians workingin the GB framework.
One question as yet unresolvedis whether clause-internal scrambling is the same typeof syntactic movement as long-distance scrambling.
InFO-TAG, both types of movement are created by thesame formal device, namely the underspecification fLP rules.
In the case of MC-TAG, only long-distancescrambling can be simulated by multicomponent ad-junction; clause-internal scrambling must be handledby some other means (such as metarules, which func-tion as an abbreviatory device for listing a finite set ofelementary trees), since it is impossible to adjoin onetree into another tree of the same tree set.
There areseveral other syntactic issues which are currently beingdebated in tile linguistic literature, and for which thetwo formalisms make different predictions.
For details,see  \[Rambow and Becker 1990\].- 25  -6 Compar ison with OtherWorkKroch, Santorini and Joshi's analy-sis \[Kroch et al1990\] of sentences like (2a) and (2b)is similar to the approach proposed in section 4.
Theyalso make use of a splitting of the auxiliary tree flof figure 2, though they split the elementary tree intodifferent ree sets.
In particular, the verb and its argu-ments are no longer contained within the same domainof locality, a key requirement of the TAG formalism.Their approach is essentially motivated by linguisticconsiderations; however, it is easy to show that theiranalysis can be expressed in our proposed variant ofMC-TAG, thus supporting our purely formal analy-sis, and also showing that the locality of TAGs can bepreserved.The proposed FO-TAG formalism is close in spirit toGPSG, in that ID and LP relations are stated sepa-rately.
IIowever, none of the work done on free word-order languages in the GPSG framework that we areaware of \[Uszkoreit 1987, Lee 1985\] deals with long-distance scrambling.7 ConclusionWe have shown that long-distance scrambling, a syn-tactic phenomenon exhibited by German and someother languages, cannot be adequately described witha TAG.
We have proposed two more powerful exten-sions of TAG: a variant of the well-studied MC-TAG,and a TAG formalism with free node order, FO-TAG.We have shown that both are descriptively adequate.The linguistic descriptions that these formalisms giverise to, however, are quite different, and they makedifferent predictions about the nature of long-distancescrambling.Some key formal properties of the two formalisms arestill under investigation, in particular the issues ofpolynomial parsability and generative power.
We con-jecture that FO-TAG and MC-TAG with dominancelinks (or some slight definitional variants of the twosystems) are weakly equivalent to each other.References\[Bayer and Kornfllt 1989\] Bayer, Josef and Kornfilt, Jak-lin, 1989.
