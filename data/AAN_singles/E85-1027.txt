A Computat iona l  Theory  of Prose Stylefor  Natura l  Language Generat ionDavid D. McDonald and James D. PnstejovskyDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceUniversity of M~,=.~chnsetts a  Amherst1.
Abst ractIn this paper we report on initial research we haveconducted on a computational theory of prose style.
Ourtheory speaks to the following major points:1.
Where in the generation process style is taken intoaccount.2.
How a particular prose style is represented; what"stylistic rules" look like;3.
What modifications to a generation algorithm areneeded; what the deci~'on is that evaluates tylisticalternatives;4.
What elaborations to the normal description ofsurface structure are necessary to make it usable asa plan for the text and a referenco for thesedecicions;5.
What kinds of information decisions about stylehave access to.Our theory emerged out of design experiments we havemade over the past year with our natural languagegeneration system, the Zetalisp program MUMBLE.
In theprocess we have extended MUMBLE through the additionof an additional process that now mediates between contentplanning and linguistic realization.
This new process, whichwe call "attachment", provides the further si~,nificant benefitthat text structure is no longer dictated by the structure ofthe message: the sequential order and dominancerelationships of concepts in the memage no longer force oneform onto the words and ph~ in the text.
Instead,rhetorical and intentional directives can be interpretedflexibly in the context of the ongoing discour~ and stylisticpreferences.
The text is built up through compos/tion underthe direction of Linguistic organly/nS principles, rather thanhaving to follow conceptual principles in Iockstep.We will begin by describing what we mean by prosestyle and then introducing the generation task that lead usto this theory, the reproduction of short encyclopediaarticles on African tribes.
We will then use that task tooutline the parts of our theory and the operations of theattachment process.
Finally we will compare our techniquesto the related work of Davey, McKeown and Derr, andGabriel, and consider some of the possible psychollnguistichypotheses that it may lead to.2.
Prose StyleStyle is an intuitive notion involving the manner inwhich something is said.
It has been more often theprofessional domain of literary critics and English teachersthan linguists, which is entirely reasonable given that itinvolves optional, often conscious decb/ons and preferencesrather than the unconscious, inviolable rules that linguiststerm Universal Grammar.To illustrate what we mean by style, cons/der the threeparagraphs in Figure 1.
As we see it, the first two ofthese have the same style, and the third has a differentone.The Ibibio are a group of six related peoples rivingin southeastern Nigeria.
They have a populationestimated at 1,500,1300, and speak a language in theBenue-Niger subfamily of the Niger-Congolanguages.
Most Ibibio are subsistence farmers, buttwo subgroups are fishermen.The Ashanti are an AKAN-speaking people ofcentral Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo andIvory Coast, numbering more than 900,000.
Theysubsist primarily by farming cacao, a major cashcrop.The Ashanti are an African people.
They live incentral Ghana and neighboring regions of Togo andIvory Coast.
Their population is more than 9(}0,000.They speak the language Akan.
They subsistprimarily by farming cacao.
Thb is a major cashcrop.1 ~ paragraphs, two styles187The first two of these paragraphs are extracted fromthe Academic American Encyclopedia; they are the leadparagraphs from the two articles on those respective tribes.The third paragraph was written by taking the sameinformation that we have posited underlies the Ashantiparagraph and regenerating from it with an impoverishedset of stylistic rules.We began looking at texts like these during thesummer of 1983, as part of the work on the "KnoesphereProject" at Atari Research (Borning et al\[1983\]).
Our goalin that project was to develop a representation for the kindof information appearing in encyclopedias which would notbe tied to the way in which it would be presented.
Thesame knowledge base objects were to be used whether oneWaS recreating an article llke the or/giuaJ, or wakin~g asimpler version to give to children, or answering isolatedquestions about the material, or giving an interactivemulti-media presentation coordinated with maps and icons,and so on.With the demise of Atari Research, this ambitious goalhas had to be put on the shelf; we have, however,continued to work with the articles on our own.
Researchon these articles lead us to begin work on p~o.~ style.
Thisremains an interesting domain in which to explore stylesince we are working with a body of texts whoseorganization is not totally dictated by its internal form.These paragraphs are representative of all the Africantribe articles in the Academic American, which is notsurprising since all of the articles were written by the sameperson and under tight editorial control.
What was moststriking to us when we first looked at these articles wastheir similarity to each other, both in the information theycontained and the way they were muctured as a text.
Wewill assume that for such texts, ~encyclopedia style" involvesat least the following two generalizations: (1) be consistentia the reformation that you provide about each tribe; and(2) adopt a complex, "information loaded" sentence structurein your presentation.
This sentence t~ructure is typified bya rich set of syntactic constructions, including the use ofconjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, coordination,secondary adjunction, and prenominal modification wheneverpossible.A contrasting style might be, for example, one that wasaimed at children; we have rewritten the information onthe Ashanti tribe as it might look in such a style.
Wehave not yet tried implementing this ~'71e qince it will callfor doing lexicalization under stylistic control, which wehave not yet designed.
"The Ashanti are an African people.
They live inWest Africa in a country called Ghana and in partsof Togo and the Ivory Coast.
There are about900DO0 people in this tribe, and they speak alanguage named AKAN.
Most of the Ashanti arecacao farmers.
"Figure 2The style of the Academic American paragraphs, on theother hand, is much tighter, with more compact sentencestructure, and a more sophisticated choice of phrasing.Such differences are the son of thing that rules of prosestyle must capture.3.
Our  Theory  of Generat ionLooking at the generation process as a whole, we havealways presumed that it involved three different stages, withour own research concentrating on the last.
(1) Deter,-,,,i,.e what goals to (attempt to) accomplish withthe utteraaes.
This initiates the other activities and posts aset of criteria they are to meet, typically information to beconveyed (e.g.
pointers to frames in the knowledge base)and speech acts to be carried out.
(2) Deriding which qx.dfle propositions to express andwhich to leave for the audlcnge to Infer on their own.This cannot be separated from working out what rhetoricalconstructions to employ in expressing the specified speechace; or from selecting the key lexical items forcommunicating the propositions.
The result of this activityis a teat plan, which has a principally conceptual vocabularywith rhetorical and lexical annotations.
The text plan isseen by the next stage as an executable %-pecification" thatis to be incrementally converted into a text.
Thespecification is given in layers, Le.
not all of the details areplanned at once.
Later, once the linguistic context of theuni~ within the s\]~t'ication has been determined, thisplanner will be recunively invoked, unit by unit, until theplanning has been done in enough detail that only linguisticproblems remain.

r t ~ u  of the ~ ~t l "u~or the uttermuz, traverdng und interpreting thts structureto preduce tim words of tim text and constrain furtherdee/stun~ This stage is responsible for the grammaticality ofthe text and its fluency as a discourse (e.g.
insuring thatthe correct terms are pronominalized, the conect focusmaintained, etc.).
The central representation is an explicitmodel of the suryace structure of the text being produced,which is used both to determine control flow and toconstrain the activities of the other ~ (see discussionin McDonald \[1984\]).
The surface structure is defined interms of a stream of phrasal nodes, constituent positions,words, and embedded information units (which willeventually have to Le sent back to the planner and thenrealized linguistically, extending the surface structure in theprocess).
The entities in the stream and their relative orderis indelible (i.e.
once selected it cannot be changed);however more material can be spficed into the stream atspecified points.3.1 WHERE IS STYLE CONSIDERED?According to our theory, prose style Is a consequenceof what decisions are made darhllg the U'ans/t/ou from theceueeptmd representationsl level to the linguistic level.
Theconceptual representation of what is to be mid--the text188plan--is modeled as a stream of information units selectedby the content planning component.
The a:tachmera processtakes units from this stream and positions them in thesurface structure somewhere ahead of the point of speech.The prose style one adopts dictates what choice theattachment process makes when faced with alternatives inwhere to position a unit: should one extend a sentence witha nonrestrictive relative clause or start a new one; expressmodification with an prenominal adjective or a postnominalprepositional phrase.
The collective pattern of suchdecisions is the compotational manifestation of one's style.3.2 EXTENSIONS TO THE SURFACE STRUCTUREREPRESENTATIONThe information units from the text plan are pos/tionedat one or another of the predefmed "attachment points" inthe surface structure.
These points are defined onstructural grounds by a grammar, and annotated accordingto the rhetorical uses they can be put to (see later examplein Figure 8).
They define the grammatically legitimateways that the surface structure might be extended: anotheradjective added to a certain noun phrase, a temporaladjunct added to a clause, another sentence add,~cl tO aparagraph, and so on.Which attachment points exist at any moment is afunction of the surface structure's configuration at thatmoment and where the point of speech is.
Since theconfiguration changes as units are added to the surfacestructure or already positioned units are realized, the set ofavailable attachment points changes as well  This isaccomplished by including the points in the definitions ofthe phrasal elements from which the mrface structure isbuilt.
We have since argued that this addition ofattachment point specifications to elementary trees is verysimilar to the grammatical formalism used in TreeAdjoining Grammars \[Joshi 1983\] and are actively exploringthe relationships between the two theories (cf.
McDonald &Pustejovsky \[1985a\].
)3.3 A DECISION PROCEDUREThe job of the attachment process is to decide whichof the available attachment points it should use inpositioning a text plan unit in the s~'face structure.
Thisdecision is a function of three kinds of things:1.
The different ways that the unit can be realized inEnglish, e.g.
most adjectives can also be couched asrelative clauses, not all full clauses can be reducedto participial adjectives.2.
The characteristics of the available attachmentpoints, especiafly the grammatical constraints thatthey would impose on the realization of any unitusing them.
The "new sentence" attachment willrequire that the unit be expressible as a clause andrule out one that could only be re.afized as a aouaphrase; attachment as the head of a noun phrasewould impose just the opposite constraint.3.
What stylistic rules have been def'med and thepredicates they apply to determine theirapplicability.The algorithm goes as follows.
The units in the streamfrom the text plan are considered one at a time in theorder that they appear.
There is no buffeting ofunpce/tioned units and no Iookahead down the stream tolook for patterns among the units; any patterns that mightbe ~gnificant are supposed to already have been seen bythe text planner and indicated by passing down compositeunits, t Each unit is thus considered on its own, on thebasis of how it can be realized.The total set of alternative phrasings for an informationunit are prccomputed and stored within the linguisticcomponent (i.e the third stage of the process) as a"real/z~tion class ~.
Different choices of syntacticarrangement, optional arguments, idiomatic wordings, etc.are anticipated before hand (by the linguist, not theprogram) and grouped together along with characteri~icsthat describe the uses to which the different choices can beput: which choice focuses which argument; which onepresumes that the audience will already understand acertain relationship, which one not.
(Realization classes arediscussed at greater length in McDonald & Pustejovsky\[19ssbV.The t int step in the attachment algorithm is tocompote all legitimate pairings of attachment points andchoices in the unit's realization dam, e,g.
a unit might beattached at a NP premodifier point using its adjectiverealization; or as postmodifier using its participialrealization; or as the next sentence in the paragraph usingany of its several realizations as a root clause.
Thisparticular case is the one in our example in Section 4.The characteristics on each of the active attachmentpoints will be compared with the characteristics on each ofthe choices in the unit's realization class.
Any choice thatis compatible with a given attachment point is grouped withit in a set; if that attachment point is selected, a laterdecision will be made among the choices in that set.Once the attachment point/choice set pairs have beencomputed, the next step is to order them according towhich is most consistent with the present prose style.
Thisis where the stylistic rules are employed.
Once the pairsare ordered, we select the pair judged to be the best anduse it.
The unit is spliced into the surface structure at theselected attachment point, and the choices consistent with1 Assumi~ that the critcrial division between conccptuaVrhctoricalplsaaias sad fin~,~c realization is that only the linguistic ~dct / / \ ]~a  '4.

unkm there is a specificallypbnncd rhetorical motive for doing ~ dictated by the planner.189that point set up for later seloction (realization of the unit)once that point it reached by the linguistic component inits traversal.3.4 STYLISTIC RULESAs we have just said, the computational job of astylistic rule it to identify preferences among attachmentpoints.
2 This means that the rides themselves can have avery simple structure.
Each rule has the following threeparts:I.
A name.
This symbol is for the conven/ence ofthe human designer; it does not take part in thecomputation.2.
An ordered list of attachment points.3.
A predicate that can be evaluated in theenvironment accesdble within the attachmentprocess.
If the predicate i t  satisfied, the rule i tapplicable.Each stylistic rule states a preference between specificattachment points, as given by the ordering it defines.
Toperform the sorting then, one performs a fairly simplecalculation (n.b.
it it simple but lengthy; see footnote).
(1) For each candidate attachment point, collect all ofthe stylistic rules that mention it in their orderedlists; discard any rules that do not mention at leastone of the other candidate points as well.
(2) Evaluate the applicability predicates of the collectedrules and discard any that fail.
(3) Using the rule, that remain, sort the list ofcandidate attachment point, so that its order matchesthe partial orders defined by the individual stylisticrule,..'~:.
have now looked at our treatment of four of thefive points which we said at the onset of this paper had tob,~ considered by any theory of prose style.
The fifthpoint, the kinds of information stylistic rules are allowed tohave accem to, requires some background illustration beforeit can be addressed; we will take it tip at the end of our4.
An Example4.1 Underlybtg representationAt the present time we are repr~ndug theinformation about a tribe in a frame language ~,-,owa asARLO \[I-Iaase 1984\], which it a CommonLitpimplementation of RLL.
We have no stock in thisrepresentation per se, aor, for that matter, in the spec/ficdetaiLs of the frames we have built ( though we are fairlypleased with both); our system has worked from otherrepresentations in the past and we expect to work with stillothers in the future.
Rather, this choice provide, us withan expeditious, non-linguistic source for the articles, whichhas the characteristic, we expect of modern representations.Figure 2 shows the toplevel ARLO frame for the Ashantiand one of its subframes.

We simply list the slots thatcontain the desired information.

Furthermore these ndm naturally fall intogroups by specialization and features held in common, sugges~ag thatthe "sort" operation co~,.'

and value.190If any of these slots are empty or "not interesting" for thetribe, it is simply left out.
The interface between plannerand realization can be this simple uecause the type of textwe axe generating is fairly programmatic and predictahle.With a more compficated task comes a more mphisticatedplanner.
The point here, however, is to examine a simpleplanning domain in order to isolate those decisions that axepurely stylistic in nature.4.2 AttaehmellgTO illustrate what attachment adds, let us t int lookwhat the usual alternative procedure, direct trandat/on, 4would do with the information plan we use for theseparagraphs.
It would realize the items in the script one byone, maintaining the given order, and the resulting textwould look like this (assuming the system had a reasonablecommand of pronominalization):The Ashanti are an African people.
They live in centralGhana and neighboring regions of Togo and Ivory Coast.
Thisis in West Africa.
Their population is more than 900~00.They ~eak the language Akan.
They ~ub~ pr/mar/ly byfarming cacao.
ThL~ is a major cash crop.Figure 5 Paragraph II by Direct ReplacementAlthough true to th?
information in the script, thismethod does not refiet.t the complex stylistic variations andenrichments that make up the original paragraph.
Theremust be something above the level of a single informationunit to coordinate the flow of text, while not altering theintentions or goals of the planner.
With this in mind, wehave built a stylistic controller which has the followingproperties:o It allows information to be "folded in" to alreadyplanned text.
Items in the script do not necessarilyappear in the same order in the text.o The decision about when to fold things in is madeon the barn of style; i.e.
if the style had beendifferent, the text would have been different as well.o The points where new material may be added toplanned text are defined on structural grounds.For example, notice that in paragraph 1I from Figure Ithe language-field is realized as as a compound adjectivalphrase, modifying the prototype; viz.
"Akan-speaking."
Forthe first article, however, the language-field is realizeddifferently.
The attachment-point that allows this "fold-in"(i.e.
attach-as-adjective) is introduced by the realizationclass for the prototype field.
The decision to select thisphrase over the sentential form in Figure 5 is made by astyllst/e rule.
This rule (cf.
Figure 6) states that theadjectival form is preferred if the language name has itsown encyclopedia entry.
5 We see that this stylistic rule isno* satisfied in Paragraph I, hence another avenue must betaken (namely, clausal).
The other attachment points usedby the stylistic rules determine whether to use a reducedrelative clause, a new sentence, or perhaps an ellipsedphrase.
The stylistic rule allowing this structure is givenbelow in Figure 6.

RulesCondder now the derivation of the first sentence ofParagraph I, and how the stylistic rules constrain theattachment process.
The first unit to be planned as surfacestructure is the prototype field--the essential attribute of theobject.
This introduces, as mentioned above, an attachmentpoint on the NP aoo:~, allowing additional information tobe added to me surface structure.

Derr and McKeown \[1984\]produce paragraph length texts by combining individualinformation units of comparable complexity to our own,into a series of compound sentences interspers~ withrhetorical connectives.
Their system is an improvement overthat of Davey \[1978\] (which it otherwise closely resembles)because of its sensitivity to dLseours~level influences uch asfocus.The standard technique for combining a sequence ofconceptual units into a text has been "direct replacement"(see discussion in Mann et al \[1982\]), in which thesequential organization of the ~ex~ is identical to that ofthe message because the mesmge is used directly as atemplate.
Our use of attachment dramatically improves onthis technique by relieving the message planner of any needto know how to organize a surface structure, letting it relyinstead on explicitly stated stylistic criteria operating afterthe planning is completed.Derr and McKeown \[1984\] also improve on directreplacement's one-proposition-for-one-sentence for d style bypermitting the combination of individual information units(of comparable compiexity to our own) into compoundsentences interspersed with rhetorical connectives.
Theywere, however, limited to extending sentences only at theirends, while our attachment procem can add units at anygrammatically licit position ahead of the po'mt of speech.Furthermore they do not yet express combination criteria asexplicit, separable rules.Dick Gabriel's program Yh \[1984\] produced polishedwritten texts through the use of critics and repeated editing.It maintained a very similar model to our own of how atext's structure can be elaborated, and produced texts ofquite high fluency.
We differ from Gabriel in trying toachieve fluency in a single online pass in the manner of aperson talking off the top of his head; this requires us toput much more of the responsibility for fluency in thewe-linguistic text planner, which is undoubtedly subject tolimitations.It is our belief that, for script-like domains, online textgeneration suffices.
This method, in fact, provides us withan interesting diagnostic to test our theory of style: namely,that stylistic rules are meaning-pre~rving, and do notchange the goals or intentions of the speaker.
Stylisticrules are to be distinguished from those syntactic rules ofgrammar which affect the semantic interpretation of asyntactic expression.
A non-restrictive r lative, for example,is a partictdar stylistic construction that adds nomeaning-delimiting predication to the denotation of the NP.Use of a restrictive relative, on the other hand, is not amatter of style, but of interpretation; "the man who owns adonkey" is not a stylistic variant of the proposition "Theman owns a donkey."
In other words, the stylLqiccomponent has no reference to intentions, goals, focus, etc.192These are the concerns of the planner, and are expressed inits choices of information units and their description (cf.Mann and Moore \[1983\] for a discussion of similarconcerns).6.
Status  and  Future  Work :  Computat iona lMode ls  o f  Text  p lann ingAt the time this is being written, the core datastructures and interpreters of the program have beenimplemented and debugged, along with the set ofattachment-points and stylistic rule,, which ate necessary toreproduce the paragraphs.
The ~ylistic planner iscompletely integrated with the language generation programand has produced texts for scene descriptions (McDonaldand Conklin (forthcoming)), narrative summaries (Cook,Lehnert, McDonald, \[1984D, and two of the threeparagraphs shown in Figure 1.Currently we are shifting domains to generatenewspaper articles, in the style of the New York Tunes.We have only a single style worked out in detail, but wewould like to handle styles involving alternative lexicalchoices, as well.Ultimately what is most exciting to us is theopportunity that we now have to use this framework todevelop precise hypotheses about the nature of the"planning unit" in human language generatinn.
This hasbeen an important question in psycholinguistic research aswell (Garrett \[19S2D.
This continum our ongoing line ofresearch on the psychological consequences of ourcomputational nalysis of generation.
The following are afew of the questions that mutt be addressed in the _r~e__archon planning:o What is the size of the planning units at variousstages; .o What is the vocabula.w that the units are stated in,e.g.
are conceptual and linguistic objects mixedtogether or are there distinct unit-types at differentlevels, with some means of cascading between levels;o Should units be modelled as "streams" withconceptual components passing in at one end andtext passing out at the other, or are they "quanta"that must be processed in their entirety one afterthe other; and finallyo Can the comnonents of a planning Unit be revisedafter they are selected, or may they only berefined.
This appears to relate to similar questionsin psycholinguistic research (see Oarrett \[1982\] forreview).7.
