In the annotation schema ofBioCaster, a text mining system for pub-lic health protection, important concepts thatreflect information about infectious diseaseswere conceptually analyzed with a formalontological methodology.
Concepts wereclassified as Types, while others were iden-tified as being Roles.
Types are specifiedas NE classes and Roles are integrated intoNEs as attributes.
We focus on the Rolesof NEs by extracting and using them indifferent ways as features in the classifier.Experimental results show that: 1) Rolesfor each NE greatly helped improve perfor-mance of the system, 2) combining informa-tion about NE classes with their Roles con-tribute significantly to the improvement ofperformance.
We discuss in detail the effectof each Role on the accuracy of text classifi-cation.1 IntroductionToday, the Internet is a powerful tool for discov-ering novel information via news feed providers.This is becoming increasingly important for thepublic health domain because it can help to de-tect emerging and re-emerging diseases.
In infec-tious disease surveillance systems such as the GlobalPublic Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) sys-tem (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004) andProMed-Mail (International Society for InfectiousDiseases, 2001), the detection and tracking of out-breaks using the Internet has been proven to be akey source of information for public health work-ers, clinicians, and researchers interested in com-municable diseases.
The basis for such systems isthe monitoring of a large number of news articlessimultaneously.
The classification of news articlesinto disease-related or none disease-related classesis the first stage in any automated approach to thistask.
In practice though there are a large number ofnews articles whose main subject is related to dis-eases but which should not necessarily be notifiedto users together with a relatively small number ofhigh priority articles that experts should be activelyalerted to.
Alerting criteria broadly include news re-lated to newly emerging diseases, the spread of dis-eases across international borders, the deliberate re-lease of a human or engineered pathogen, etc.
Theuse of only raw text in the classification process in-evitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, forexample semantic class ambiguities in polysemouswords like ?virus?, ?fever?, ?outbreak?, and ?con-trol?
which all exhibit a variety of senses dependingon context.
These different senses appear with rela-tively high frequency in the news especially in head-lines.
A further challenge is that diseases can be de-noted by many variant forms.
Therefore we considerthat the use of advanced natural language process-ing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition(NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in orderto achieve high classification accuracy.Text classification is defined as the task of as-signing documents into one or more predefined cat-17egories.
As shown by (Cohen and Hersh, 2005),an accurate text classification system can be espe-cially valuable to database curators.
A document inthe biomedical domain can be annotated using NERtechniques with enriched semantic information inthe form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, loca-tion, and time.
NER and term identification in gen-eral have been recognized as an important researchtopic both in the NLP and biomedical communities(Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004).
However, an in-vestigation into the contribution of NEs on the per-formance of annotated biomedical text classificationhas remained an open question until now.
There aretwo main reasons for this: Firstly there are a smallnumber of open annotation schema for biomedicaltext, and secondly there is no benchmark annotateddata for testing.The BioCaster project (Collier, 2006) is workingtowards the detection and tracking of disease out-breaks from Internet news articles.
Although thereare several schema for biomedical text (Wilbur et al,2006), little work has been done on developing onespecifically for public health related text.
BioCastertherefore provides an annotation schema that can fillthis gap.
Our schema, which is based on discussionswith biologists, computational linguists and publichealth experts, helps identify entities related to in-fectious diseases which are then used to build up adetailed picture of events in later stages of text min-ing.
One significant aspect of the schema is that itis based on conceptual analysis with a formal on-tological methodology.
As discussed in (Kawazoeet al, 2006), by applying meta-properties (Guarinoand Welty, 2000a; Guarino and Welty, 2000b), our?markable?
concepts are classified into ?Type?
and?Role?.
Information about Role concepts is inte-grated into the schema as attributes on NEs.
Thiswork takes the investigation one step forward byshowing empirical evidence for the usefulness ofRole concepts in a practical application.In this paper, we focus on the task of text classifi-cation, proceeding under the simplifying assumptionthat given enough annotated training data for NEsand their Roles both can be automatically taggedwith high accuracy.
In recent years there have beenmany studies on text classification using generalmethods (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999)semi-structured texts (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004),and XML classification (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2003).Other research has investigated the contribution ofsemantic information in the form of synonyms, syn-tax, etc.
in text representation (Bloehdorn andHotho, 2004; Hotho et al, 2003; Fru?rnkranz et al,1998).
Feature selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999)has also been studied.
The contribution of this paperis to provide an analysis and evaluation on the Rolesof NEs in annotated text classification.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: inSection 2, we outline the BioCaster schema for theannotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3presents a description of the BioCaster gold standardcorpus; Section 4 provides details of the methodand experimental results of classification on the goldstandard corpus.
Finally we draw some conclusionsin Section 5.2 BioCaster Schema for Annotation ofTerms in Biomedical TextThe BioCaster annotation schema is a component ofthe BioCaster text mining project.
We have iden-tified several important concepts that reflect infor-mation about infectious diseases, and created guide-lines for annotating them as target entity classesin texts.
Based on the conceptual analysis usingmeta-properties (rigidity, identity, and dependency)developed by Guarino and Welty (2000a; 2000b),categories of important concepts were classified asTypes, i.e., properties which are rigid1 and supplyidentity conditions, while others were identified asbeing Roles, properties which are anti-rigid2 anddependent.
The 18 categories of Type conceptsare specified as NE classes which we denote herein upper case.
These include PERSON, LOCA-TION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, DISEASE, CON-DITION (status of patient such as ?hospitalized?or ?in stable condition?
), OUTBREAK (event ofgroup infection), VIRUS, ANATOMY (body part),PRODUCT (biological product such as ?vaccine?
),NONHUMAN (animals), DNA, RNA, PROTEIN,CONTROL (control measures to contain the dis-ease), BACTERIA, CHEMICAL and SYMPTOM.The three Role concepts we explore are case (dis-1A property is rigid if every instance of that property neces-sarily has the property, i.e.
in every possible world.2A property is anti-rigid if no instance of that property nec-essarily has the property.18eased person), transmission (source of infection)and therapeutic (therapeutic agent).
These are inte-grated into the annotation schema as XML attributeswhich are associated with some XML elements de-noting Type concepts.
PERSON takes a case at-tribute, NONHUMAN and ANATOMY take trans-mission, PRODUCT takes transmission and thera-peutic and CHEMICAL takes therapeutic.
For PER-SON we added another attribute number (numberof people).
Each attribute has only one value, thevalue of number is one or many, and the value ofcase, transmission, therapeutic is true or false.
Thisis summarized in Table 1.
In the rest of this paper,we call case, transmission, and therapeutic ?Role at-tributes?
(or ?Role?
for short) and number a ?Qual-ity attributes?
(or ?Quality?
for short).A NE in a biomedical text is annotated followingthe BioCaster annotation schema in XML format asfollows,<NAME cl="Named Entity"attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"... </NAME>,where "Named Entity" is one of the names for the18 BioCaster NEs and attribute1, attribute2,... are the names of the NE?s Role/Quality at-tributes, "value1", "value2", ... are values cor-responding to Role/Quality attributes.
Further de-tails of the annotation guidelines are discussed in(Kawazoe et al, 2006).3 BioCaster Gold Standard Data CorpusThe BioCaster gold standard corpus was collectedfrom Internet news and manually annotated by twodoctoral students.
The annotation of a news articleproceeded as follows.
Firstly, NEs are annotated fol-lowing the BioCaster schema and guidelines.
Sec-ondly, each annotated article is manually assignedinto one of four relevancy categories: alert, publish,check, and reject.
The assignment is based on guide-lines that we made following discussions with epi-demiologists and a survey of World Health Organi-zation (WHO) reports (World Health Organization,2004).
These categories are currently being used op-erationally by the GPHIN system which is used bythe WHO and other public health agencies.
Wherethere were major differences of opinion in NE anno-tation or relevancy assignment between the two an-notators, we consulted a public health expert in orderto decide the most appropriate assignment.
Finallywe had a total of 500 articles that were fully anno-tated.
While this is small compared to other datasets in text classification, we consider that it is largeenough to obtain a preliminary indication about theusefulness of Role attributes.The following is an example of an annotated arti-cle in the BioCaster gold standard corpus.Example.<DOC id="000125" language="en-us"source="WHO" domain="health"subdomain="disease"date published="2005-03-17"relevancy="alert"> <NAME cl="DISEASE">Acute fever </NAME> and <NAMEcl="DISEASE"> rash syndrome </NAME> in<NAME cl="LOCATION">Nigeria</NAME> <NAMEcl="TIME"> 17 March 2005 </NAME><NAMEcl="ORGANIZATION"> WHO</NAME> has receivedreports of <NAME cl="PERSON" case="true"number="many"> 1118 cases </NAME>including <NAME cl="PERSON" case="true"number="many">76 deaths</NAME>casefatality rate, 6.8% reported in 12Local Government Areas (LGAs) of <NAMEcl="LOCATION">damawa </NAME> state, <NAMEcl="LOCATION"> Nigeria</NAME> as of <NAMEcl="TIME">28 February 2005</NAME>.
Thecases have been clinically diagnosedas <NAME cl="DISEASE"> measles </NAME>but no laboratory diagnosis has beenmade to date.
Other states, including<NAME cl="LOCATION">Gombe</NAME>,<NAME cl="LOCATION">Jigawa</NAME>,<NAMEcl="LOCATION">Kaduna</NAME>, <NAMEcl="LOCATION">Kano</NAME>, and <NAMEcl="LOCATION">Kebbi</NAME> have allreported <NAME cl="OUTBREAK"> outbreaks</NAME> of <NAME cl="DISEASE"> measles</NAME>... </DOC>We grouped the 500 articles into 2 categories: re-ject and relevant.
The reject category correspondssimply to articles with label reject while the relevantcategory includes articles with labels alert, pub-lish, and check.
We conflated the alert, publish andcheck categories because we hypothesized that dis-tinguishing between non-reject (relevant) categories19Named entity Role/Quality attributes Named entity Role/Quality attributesPERSON case, number ANATOMY transmissionORGANIZATION none SYMPTOM noneLOCATION none CONTROL noneTIME none CHEMICAL therapeuticDISEASE none BACTERIA noneCONDITION none PRODUCT transmission, therapeuticNONHUMAN transmission DNA noneVIRUS none RNA noneOUTBREAK none PROTEIN noneTable 1: Lists of Named entity classes and their Role/Quality attributes in BioCaster annotation schema.would require higher level semantic knowledge suchas pathogen infectivity and previous occurrence his-tory which is the job of the text mining system andthe end user.
Finally we had a total of 269 newsarticles belong to the reject category and 231 newsarticles belong to the relevant category.
The statis-tical information about NEs is shown in Table 2.
Inthe table, ?+?
stands for the frequency of NEs in therelevant category and ?-?
stands for the frequency ofNEs in the reject category.4 Experiments4.1 MethodWe used the BioCaster gold standard corpus to in-vestigate the effect of NE classes and their Role at-tributes on performance of classification.
In orderto avoid unnecessary data, we removed the first linecontaining DOC tag of all article in the corpus.
Thevalidation is as follows.
We randomly divided thedata set into 10 parts.
Each of the first 9 parts has 23articles belonging to the relevant category and 27 ar-ticles belonging to the reject category; the 10th parthas 24 articles belonging to the relevant and 26 arti-cles belonging to the reject categories.
Then, we im-plemented 10-fold cross validation: 9 parts for train-ing and 1 part for testing sets.
For the training set weextracted NEs classes and their Roles as features tobuild a classifier.
The remaining part was used fortesting.The classifier we use in this paper is the standardNa?ive Bayes classifier (Mitchell, 1997).
In the pre-processing we did not use a stop list and no wordstemming.
The experiments were implemented inLinux OS, using the Bow toolkit (McCallum, 1996).The details of extracting NEs and their Rolesfrom annotated texts are the followings.
For thesake of convenience, we divided features into 3groups: Features for each NE, features for NEs withRole/Quality, and features for combined NEs withRole/Quality.1.
Features for each NE: Each NE is extracted andused with raw text as features.
We denoted NE1as features extracted from named entity NE1.For example, DISEASE1 means features areraw text and DISEASE class, VIRUS1 meansfeatures are raw text and VIRUS class.
An ex-ample of features for PERSON1 is shown inTable 3.2.
Features for NEs with Role/Quality: We inves-tigated the effect of NEs with Roles/Qualities,i.e., case, number, therapeutic, and transmis-sion.
Features are chosen as follows.- PERSON+case+number: Raw text andPERSON class with both Role case andQuality number are used as features.- PERSON+case: Raw text and PERSONclass with Role case are used as features.- PERSON+number: Raw text and PER-SON class and Quality number are usedas features.- NONHUMAN+trans: Raw text andNONHUMAN class and Role transmis-sion are used as features.- ANATOMY+trans: Raw text andANATOMY class and Role transmissionare used as features.20NE class Frequency Total NE class Frequency TotalPERSON +3291/-4978 8269 ANATOMY +263/-224 487ORGANIZATION +1405/-3460 4865 SYMPTOM +293/-105 398LOCATION +2432/-2409 4841 CONTROL +282/-87 369TIME +1159/-1518 2677 CHEMICAL +108/-185 293DISEASE +1164/-456 1620 BACTERIA +136/-103 239CONDITION +689/-206 895 PRODUCT +124/-74 198NONHUMAN +393/-344 737 DNA +8/-55 63VIRUS +428/-127 555 RNA +0/-55 55OUTBREAK +460/-75 535 PROTEIN +5/-32 37Table 2: The frequency of NE classes in the BioCaster gold standard corpus, ?+?

Features for combined NEs with Roles.
Weinvestigate features for disease-related NEswhich include DISEASE, VIRUS, BACTE-RIA, SYMPTOM, CONDITION, CONTROL,DNA, PROTEIN, RNA, OUTBREAK, PROD-UCT, ANATOMY, NONHUMAN, CHEMI-CAL and features for all NEs with their Roles,i.e., therapeutic and transmission.
We investi-gated 5 different features as follows:- Text only: Only raw text is used as fea-tures.- Text+DiseaseNEs: Raw text and all 14NEs disease-related classes are used asfeatures.- Text+DiseaseNEs+Roles: Raw text andall 14 NEs disease-related classes withRoles are used as features.
We note thatthere are two Roles therapeutic and trans-mission in this case.- Text+AllNEs: Raw text and all NE classesare used as features.- Text+AllNEs+Roles: Raw text and all NEclasses with Roles are used as features.
Inthis case we have all 3 Roles case, thera-peutic and transmission.An example of using different features for PER-21YES is correct NO is correctAssigned YES a bAssigned NO c dTable 4: A contingency table.SON class is shown in Table 3.4.2 Results and DiscussionsThe details of experimental results are shown in thefollowing sections.
We use two performance mea-sures, standard Precision/Recall and accuracy.
Theyare calculated based on the two-way contingency ta-ble in Table 4.
In the table, a counts the assignedand correct cases, b counts the assigned and incor-rect cases, c counts the not assigned but incorrectcases, and d counts the not assigned and correctcases (Yang, 1999).
Then,Precision = aa + b , and Recall =aa + c .Accuracy is defined as accuracy=(a + d)/(a + b +c + d).4.2.1 Effectiveness of Each NE ClassIn order to investigate the effect of NEs on per-formance, we consider the baseline as the methodusing text only.
In experiment the baseline achieveda performance of 74.40% accuracy and 64.35% Pre-cision, 100% Recall.
We can see that Recall alwaysachieves 100% in all cases.
This may be due to thesmall size of data.
However it is interesting that wecan observe the change of Precision measure - animportant measure in our case.
Hereafter we discussaccuracy and Precision only.The effectiveness of each NE class is shown in Ta-ble 5.
The results show that each NE does not havethe same effect.
Compared to the baseline, nearlyhalf the total NEs (7/18) help improve performancewhile the others do not have a significant affect.Looking at the distribution of NE frequency in Ta-ble 2, it seems that the higher the frequency of theNE class, the better the performance it provides.
Forexample, PERSON achieved the best of all (76.80%accuracy, 66.57% Precision compared to 74.40% ac-curacy and 64.35% Precision when using raw text).However this trend is not always followed, for ex-ample, the TIME class tends to reduce performancewhen compared to raw text.
This is natural as thereis no obvious correlation between time and rele-vancy.
From the result tables we can conclude thatthe effectiveness of each NE on the performance ofclassification in our corpus is decreased in the fol-lowing order.PERSON > LOCATION > ORGANIZATION >DISEASE > CONDITION = VIRUS = OUT-BREAK > NONHUMAN = ANATOMY = SYMP-TOM = CONTROL = BACTERIA = PRODUCT =PROTEIN > CHEMICAL = DNA = RNA > TIMEIn particular, 7 NEs, i.e., PERSON, LO-CATION, ORGANIZATION, DISEASE, CONDI-TION, VIRUS, OUTBREAK improve performance,while TIME significantly reduces it.
Two NEs DNAand RNA that have low frequency weakly reduceperformance.4.2.2 Effectiveness of Roles on ClassificationIn this Section we investigate the effect of eachRole on performance.
The experimental results areshown in Table 6.
We can easily observe that Rolesin NEs improved both the accuracy and Precisionsignificantly.We first consider the Role case.
This Role is as-sociated to PERSON which has highest frequencyin the corpus.
Role case helped improve the ac-curacy from 76.8% to 80.60%, and Precision from66.57% to 74.43% for PERSON.
This is significantwhen we compare to the baseline with 74.4% ac-curacy and 64.35% Precision.
We note that PER-SON has another attribute, the Quality number.
Rolecase helps PERSON with Quality number improvethe accuracy from 78.00% to 81.80% and Precisionfrom 67.74% to 71.74%.
Moreover, we can obvi-ously draw the relative comparison about effective-ness between Role case and Quality number fromthese results, it yields that case > number.We proceed to investigate the effect of Roles ther-apeutic and transmission.
Obviously we see thattheir effects on performance are positive.
Specifi-cally, transmission help NONHUMAN improve theaccuracy from 74.40% to 74.60%, therapeutic helpsCHEMICAL improve the accuracy from 74.20% to74.40%.
They both have not effects on some mi-nor NE classes like ANATOMY and PRODUCT.
Ifwe had more training data with more of these mi-nor NE classes we hope to see a positive effect from22Named entity Accuracy Pre/Rec Named entity Accuracy Pre/RecPERSON1 76.80 66.57/100 ANATOMY1 74.40 64.35/100ORGANIZATION1 75.40 65.25/100 SYMPTOM1 74.40 64.35/100LOCATION1 75.60 65.44/100 CONTROL1 74.40 64.35/100TIME1 73.00 63.11/100 CHEMICAL1 74.20 64.17/100DISEASE1 75.00 64.89/100 BACTERIA1 74.40 64.35/100CONDITION1 74.60 64.53/100 PRODUCT1 74.40 64.35/100NONHUMAN1 74.40 64.35/100 DNA1 74.20 64.17/100VIRUS1 74.60 64.53/100 RNA1 74.20 64.17/100OUTBREAK1 74.60 64.53/100 PROTEIN1 74.40 64.35/100Table 5: Performance of each NE class in which features of NEs in bold text have Role attributes.FEATURES Accuracy Pre/RecBaseline 74.40 64.35/100PERSON1 76.80 66.57/100PERSON+number 78.00 67.74/100PERSON+case 80.60 74.43/100PERSON+case+number 81.80 71.74/100NONHUMAN1 74.40 64.35/100NONHUMAN+trans 74.60 64.53/100ANATOMY1 74.40 64.35/100ANATOMY+trans 74.40 64.35/100PRODUCT1 74.40 64.35/100PRODUCT+trans 74.40 64.35/100PRODUCT+therapeutic 74.40 64.35/100PRODUCT+trans+thera 74.40 64.35/100CHEMICAL1 74.20 64.17/100CHEMICAL+therapeutic 74.40 64.35/100Table 6: Performance of Role attributes with theirNEs.Roles on them.
Interestingly, while NEs associatedto Roles do not improve the accuracy like NONHU-MAN and CHEMICAL, their Roles helped improvethe accuracy.
Based on the improvements of trans-mission and therapeutic in Table 6, we can drawtheir effectiveness are the same on their NEs, thatis therapeutic = transmission.When we compare the effect of all Roles on per-formance, we can see that the improvements of Rolecase and also Quality number are much higher thanthe improvements of Roles therapeutic and trans-mission.
We think this is because the frequency ofPERSON (NE associated to Role case and Qualitynumber) is higher than the frequency of NEs whichFEATURES Accuracy Pre/RecBaseline 74.40 64.35/100Text+DiseaseNEs 75.80 65.63/100Text+DiseaseNEs+Roles 76.20 66.00/100Text+AllNEs 79.40 69.16/100Text+AllNEs+Roles 84.40 74.76/100Table 7: The performance of combined NEs withtheir Roles.are associated to Roles therapeutic and transmis-sion in the corpus.
Then, we can have the effectof Roles/Qualities is in the order case > number >therapeutic = transmission.4.2.3 Effectiveness of Combined NEs withRolesWe continue to investigate the effectiveness ofRoles for combined NEs.
The experimental re-sults are given in Table 7.
We note that there aretwo Roles therapeutic and transmission in disease-related NE classes, and all 3 Roles case, therapeuticand transmission in all NE classes.We can easily see that Roles improved perfor-mance of text classification significantly.
In de-tails, for disease-related NE classes, Roles thera-peutic and transmission helped to improve the ac-curacy from 74.40% to 76.20%, and Precision from64.35% to 66.% compared to the baseline.
For allNE classes, all 3 Roles case, therapeutic, and trans-mission help to improve the accuracy from 74.40%to 84.40% and Precision from 64.35% to 74.76%.We conclude that all 3 Roles achieved the best re-sults in performance.235 ConclusionThis paper has focused on the contribution of Rolesin biomedical annotated text classification.
The ex-perimental results indicated that:1.
Roles of each NE greatly help improve perfor-mance of the system.2.
The effect of Role/Quality attributes on classi-fication was decreased in the order as follows:case > number > therapeutic = transmission.3.
Combined NE classes with Roles contributesignificantly to the improvement of perfor-mance.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank Mika Shigematsu andKiyosu Taniguchi at the National Institute of Infec-tious Diseases for useful discussions.
