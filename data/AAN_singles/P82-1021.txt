A SOCIETY IN TRANSITIONDonald E. WalkerArtificial Intelligence CenterSRI InternationalMenlo Park, California 94025, USAI was President in 1968, the year duringwhich the Association for Machine Translation andComputational Linguistics became the Associationfor Computational Linguistics.
Names alwayscreate controversy, and the founding name,selected in 1962, was chosen in competition withothers, not the least of which was the one thatsubsequently replaced it.
In fact, a change ofname to the Association for ComputationalLinguistics was actually approved in 1963, at whathas been described as an "unofficial meeting.
"However, that action was subsequently ruled out oforder, since it did not result from aconstitutional amendment.
Five years later,proper procedure having been followed, the changewas made officially.The organizational impetus for theestablishment of the Association did cameprimarily from a group of people who had beenworking on machine translation.
However, as inmost scientific societies, there has always been--and probably always will be--a tension betweenresearch and applicatlons.
The primary motivationfor the name change in 1968 was the recognition,shared but by no means universal, that we neededto address more basic issues first.
The report onLanguage and Machines: Computers in TranslationLinguistics by the Automatic LanguageProcessing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) in 1966became a focal point for this controversy.
It wasviewed by translation specialists as an attack ontheir work, and it certainly resulted in dramaticreductions in funding for machine translation.However, its authors claim it was intended as anargument for increased support of research.Certainly, the lead article in the October-November 1966 issue of The Finite String, whichwas titled "Potential Bright for Language-Analysisby Computer; NRC Report Urges Support," presentedthat view.
In any case, the argument thatcomputational linguistics "should be supported asa science and should not be Judged by anyimmediate or foreseeable contributions topractical translation" seemed to frighten ratherthan challenge the funding agencies in theimmediately following years.Another factor motivating the change of namein 1968 was the appreciation of the potential forthe use of computational linguistics ininformation retrieval and in stylistic analysis.~.~nanical translation was only one of a number ofexciting application areas.
During that year, Ispent a substantial amount of time coordinatingwith the Special Interest Group on InformationRetrieval (SIGIR) and the Special InterestCommittee on Language Analysis and Studies in theHumanities (SICLASH), both of the Association forComputing Machinery, and with the Special InterestGroup on Automated Language Processing (SlGALP) ofthe American Society for Information Science.There were also meetings with the LinguisticSociety of America, the Modern LanguageAssociation, and the Center for AppliedLinguistics.
In addition, during the year, ACLbecame a constituent society of the AmericanFederation of Information Processing Societies(AFIPS), of which it had been first an unofficialand then an official "observer" since 1964.
I wasthe first ACL member of the Board of Directors,and I became actively involved in a number of itscommittees, most particularly the one onInformation Systems.
I also became the ACLrepresentative to the newly formed InternationalJoint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and,subsequently, Program Chairman of its firstmeeting in 1969.These organizational relationships, coupledwith my own tendency toward global perspectives,led me to view the ACL as a central point aroundwhich everything else revolved.
In computationallinguistics, there are aspects of science,engineering, the humanities, the social andbehavioral sciences, education, andcommunications.
I contemplated the time when, inaddition to being members of AFIPS, ourAssociation would be equally implicated in theAmerican Association for the Advancement ofScience, the American Council of LearnedSocieties, and the Social Science ResearchCouncil.
And I only regretted that at that timethere were no aggregate groups for education, andcommunications to round out the picture.This "message" was the substance of myPresidential address.
I tried to leaven it with alittle humor to make it more palatable, but Iremember the banquet which preceded it (preparedby the University of lllinois 1111ni Union) as themost horrible meal the ACL has ever had toconfront.
I am sure that the failure of themembers attendant to rally to my cause and carrymy message to the multitudes (or even to Garcia)was due in no small measure to the poor quality ofthe food.But let me return briefly to name changes andto the tension between research and applications.During our discussions about the forthcomingConference on Applied Natural Language Processing,which the ACL will be cosponsoring with the NavalResearch Laboratory, 1-3 February 1983, in Santa98Monlca, we considered calling it "Conference onApplied Computational Linguistics."
However, itbecame clear that we could not expect to have asbroadly based a meeting as we wanted with thatname.
It is important now to reach out to thelarger community.
Once we have them listening tous, it will be all right for them to find out thatthey have been "practicing computationallinguistics all their (professional) lives!
"Fascinated as I am about the applicability ofcomputational linguistics for its own sake, what Ifind most exciting is the value that the use ofour systems will have for deepening our insightsinto the basic research issues that still face us.I believe that studying people "organizing andusing information" on the kinds of systems we arenow beginning to develop can revolutlonlze ourunderstanding of what we do and do not know aboutcomputational linguistics, as well as guide theimprovement of our systems more effectively(Walker, 1971, 1972, in press).Walker, DE.
