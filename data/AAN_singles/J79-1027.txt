SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTSON SENTENCE COMPREHENSION MODELSIn t h i s  paper I consider t h e  question of how an automat icsentence recognizer would have to look in order to be compatiblewLth present psycholinguistic knowledge about speech c o m p r e h m hThe basic premise is that psycholinguistic considerations are ofpotential interest to computational theories (see ,  e .

,~chank(1972)Let me begin by summarizing some characteristics of speeckprocessing which we know either from experiments, or which arei n t u i t i v e l y  clear.First, there i s  some evidence t h a t  the clause i s  a u n i t  ofprocessing.
For instance, ~aplan(1972) showed that aftera clause boundary is passed, the cons-bitaent words bf thecompleted clause are relatively inaccesai'ble, as measured byw m d  recognition la tency.
The ef fect  was independent of theserial position of the word for which recognition time wastested.
This  suggests that sentences are processed clause byclause, w i t h  on ly  the semantic content regularly retained afterthe clause boundary is passed.
The surface words (and g fortiorithe syntactic s tructure)  of the clause would tend t o  be erasedafter each clause boundary.

I wish to thank Thomas G .

These a u t h o r s  found t h a t  r eac t ion  t imeto s h o r t  bursts of noise "cl icks")  superimposed on sentenceswas longer for clause-final clicks than for clause-initialones.
This would point to the clause as unit of perception,under the assumption t h a t  processing is more intensive towardsthe end of a perce~tua l  unit, and that reaction time to e x t e r n a lstimuli is a valid ineicator of t h e  intensity of internalprocesging.
or a review of other studies in support of theclausal processing theory, the reader i s  referred toPodor, Bever & ~arre%t(1974), where arguments a r e  a l s o  givenf o r  the clause as a decision point across which ambiguitiisare ,normally at least ,  not carried-.
)Secondly, it seems t h a t  as we l i s t e n  to speech, wesimultaneously have access to both the syntactic and semanticpropertiee of what we hear.
That is, there appears to be ~ a r a l l e lorocessing of the  syntax and the semantics of a clause.
Onefinding explained by this assumption i s  that  so-called"irreversible" passive sentences like (1) are perceptually nomore complex thnn their active counterparts (the air1 ~ i c k e dthe rlower,in this case) .
By cont ras t ,  'reversiblew passivesl i k e  ( 2 )  take longer to verify vis-a-vis p i c t u r e s  than the~orre~pondin$ active sentences (~lobin(1.966) ) .presumably contain8 surface wards as terminal nodes.
Hence ifthe eyntax were regularly preserved the surface words shouldremain easily accessible, too.

.3 ~ y  view of the r o l e  of syntax is related to t h a t  expressed in~chank(1972), who believes that the function of syntax is""as a pointer to semantic information rather than as a f irs tstep to aemantic analysis?'
( ~ ~ 5 5 5 )  Similarly, winograd (1971)a l l o w s  parallel operation of syntactic and semantic analysis.However, m e  syntactic and semantic processor in Winograd'ssystehr have f u l l  power, in minciple ,  to question each otherabout their respective success before proceeding with theirpart pf the  analysis* This powerful device has been aeverelyrestricted in the  theory described here (for details, seeReimold (f o r t h c  oming) ) The main reasons f o r  th ie  are thegreater re l iance ,  in my theory, on "syntax-free" semanticinterpretation, and the generally shorter life-apan ofsyntactic structure (see t h e  d iscuss ion  of "peripheralclauses" b e l o w ) .
Woods (1973) also discussee  a system w i t hcer ta in  facilities f o r  parallel processing, for instance,the "Selnctlve Modifier Placement" facility (sMP)~ Thefunction of SMP is to ~ e l s c t  from the list o f  syn%acticallyadrnissibLe alternatives the one which is semantically mostappropriate, and return only that alternative to the  parserbefore golng an *o analyze the r e s t  o f  the sentence.
The mostimportant difference between Woods' proposal and the onepresented here is that his semantic processor o n l y  chooaesamong t a c t  tructQrsd alternatives (and, in t h a t  sense,% a fu%$%$tax-sensltve method),  whereas my t h e o r ypartdates rn gyntactfclm m e n  w h  modif iers  and t h e i r  heads .Let me return now to the principle of clause-by-clauseprocessing, If we assume that "imqediate processing" takesplace in short term memory, then we must automaticallyrequkre that t h e  unit of processing m u s t  not exceed the knownLimits of s h o r t  term memory.
Now since t h a t  limit is generallytaken to be about 5 wordsp the clause-by-clause princ ip lecannot  be literally true.
For instance.

That is, f draw a distinction between t h e  "nucLearHclause and "peripheralw clauses.
The non-underlined 'portionsin (3)  are nuclear clauses.
Peripheral clauses include:Prep-clauses ( " w i t h  t h e  c o l l a r " ) ,  Comparison-clauses ("thanthe old c o l o n e l w ) .
Post-clauses ("yesterday, 'I "around ten o t c l o ~'in a l i t t l e  cafe") ,  and Coordinate-clauses ("and Bill," "andhugged")This treatment of ce r t a in  phrases as peripheral clausesseems plaus ib le  t o o ,  if w e  consider t h a t  "adnominal" Prep-phrases, f o r  instance, are semantically l i k e  r e l a t i v e  clauses,as shown in (4), and that  adverbs are para l le l  to c e r t a i n"adverbialU clauses, as indicated in (5).

Fnr inetance, linguistic theorywould claim that sentence (10) has the syntactic structwe in(11)~ which then undergoes various syntactic transformationsuntil it is finally mapped onto i t s  appropriate semantics true ture .The rrentence recognizers moat directly meetfng this descriptiorare robabl those developed by Stanley Petr ick  (see P e t r i c k  ( ~ 9 6 9 ,  197)y) .
Wlth some modlf icatione, however, t h i sdeecription also  f i t s  the theories preeerited in Winograd (1971)and Woode (1973).
Whkle these syetema are feature-manipulatingrather than transformational, they nonetheless assume t h a t  thelife-span of syntax extends over an entire sentence, and theymake crucial use of integrated syntactic structures f o rcorn l a x  sentences  or instan~e, winograd (1971) presentsan f ntegrated syntactic structure for the sentence "Pick  upanything green, at l eas t  three of the blocker and eithera box or a sphere which is bigger than any brick on the table.Recagnlzere ueing an inverse "Geherative Se'lllantics" grammarwould a ldo  f a l l  under t h i s  deecriptioh.

The trees m (-12) above are exarpples.For the remainder, let me concentrate on t h e  semantic box.I suggest t h a t  there are three stapes in the semantic analysis.as shown in FigS, namely a preliminary, intermediate, andf.inal semantic representatton (PSR, ISR, and FSR).Preliminary SR f - $ ~ ~ t e r r n e d i a t e w  Fina l  SR Ic onc at enati on Meaning Rules & (Rules1 '-Encyclopedic Rules 'Fig.24 +Stage Model of Semantic AnalysisThe PSIi corresponds to a simple comblnat ip~~ of t h e  l ex ica lmeaninsrs of the words.

Backgrounded propositions are the expressions tothe rl&t of the  colon w i t h i n  the prefixes.
For instance, thefirst prefix in (13) contains the  quantifier THE, t h e  variable&@ and a backgrounded pl?oposition BO'lhc, and the entire  prefixis readt "The entity x such mat x is &.boy.

B u tin order to describe what the l ig tener  actually understand$when hearing %he bov l a u d e d ,  we must o f  course specifywhich r o l e  the boy plays in t h i s  event.Now, looking at the final SH in (13).

It shows three differentblocks of rules which are responsible for deriving the threestages of the semantic analysis, namely, Concatenation Rules,Meaning Rules and Encyclopedic Rules (collectively ~ e f  erredto as Semantic Knowledge ~ules), and finally Semantic LinkingStrategies.
They will occupy ue fn this orderThe Concatenation Rules take the semantic def in i t ion  o fthe most recent input word and add it to the c u r r e n tpreliminary semantic structure.

Such "active" information w o u l d  be addedcontinuously t o  the "situational chapter" of the $ncyclopedia,where this chapter is thought of a3 containing The linguisticand non-linguistic context  of the current  utterance.Concerning the retrieval problem, it is clear t h a t  theinformation in the  encyclopedia must be extracted s e l e c t i v e l y .The solution chosen here i s  the one characteristik ~f networksEach Knowledge Rule is given an address, and each l ex ica lentry, as well as each Knowledga Rule, includes pointers tot h e  address of some o the r  relevant Knowledge Rules; Only tnosegules are ca l l ed  up which are associated with the sentenceconstituents through some pointer.In the case of Meaning 2ules t h i s  res tr i c t ion  seemssu f f i c i en t ,  because there are only  f e w  for each lexi-cal entry.N o t  so in t h e  case of Encyclopedic R u l e s .
For instance, thebeare all kinds  of things I know about bakers --say, t h a t  theytend t o  wear white c l o t h e s  for work--, but most of which areirrelevant for understanding and verifying the  sentence1(18) T h e  bay was sold a n i c e  cake b y - t h e  baker.u s e d  features whereas I use meaning postulates@ For practicalpurposes, the m o s t  important aspect 'af the  d i s t i n c t i o n  ist ha t  M-rlxles are applied obligatorily, while E-rules areapplied &electively, according to the intersection technique*( s e e  the  discussion below.)
Fot: a discussion and cr i t ique  ofthe ''featurelln approach, see Weinreich(l966).For instance,  the sentence is perfect ly  t r u e  even if thebaker happened to be wearing a f lremanB s uniform whi l eselling the  cake to the boy.A good way of restricting t h e  number of Knowledge Rulescalled up for a given sentence seems t h e  IntersectionStrategy (cf.

(19) Intersection StratemcIf a clause contains  two  d i f fe ren t  constituents A and 3both pointing to the same encJIclopedic rule E, then c a l l  B eT h i s  r u l e  says to c a l l  up only  those  Encyclopedic i iuleswhich are associated w k t h  a% least two constituents of t h esentence.

"Alternative Linking"Types 1, 2, and 3 are  syntax-fre8.
Type 4, the "CxnanicalOrder"  stratecy (cf.

Type 5 is nensi-f;ive to "functional" featllresoccur r ing  in t h e  syntactic sur face  t r ee .
The 6th type,"Alternative Linking Strategies," will be explained l a t e r  on;t h e y ,  too, are p i ~ r e l y  semantic, Lh-gugh t hey  apply o n l y  a f tert h e  syntax-sensitive ru le8  have appl i ed  (and failed).Nbw, w i t h i n  th i s  system of linking strategies, there see3to be different l eve l s  of detail.
A t  the shallowest level wehave Linking by Variable  Type.
Pattern icatching requiresmore semantic de ta i l  1 and Contradfc~t ion  Elimination is sti 11more thorough.
Furthermore,  thp syntax-free strategies rnaybe assumed to be simpler than the  syntax-sensitive ones,because t h e  lat ter  must keep track of t w o  separate structuresnamely the semantic and the syntactic structure.
I assumet h a t  t h e  strategies are ordered according to their re la t i vesimplicity, which would give us t h e  order as l i s t e d  in (22)Furthermore, I assume that once an acceptable readinghas been derived f o r  a clause ,  application o f  f u r t h e rstrategies in the hierarchy becomes o~ t ion t&.
This  of courseis subject to empirical t e s t s .
For instance, Pattern Katchingwould interpret the  sentence:(23) The baker was sold some stale bread by the butcher.incorrectly as "the baker s o l d  the  butcher some s t a l e  bread.
''If application of further strategies is indeed optional, suchsentences should sometimee be misinterpreted.There is in fact  some intuitive support for suck a positionI 'think most of u% have experienced situations where a Slip ofthe Yongue like put the freezer in the turkev passed unnoticedatfirst.
This ie moat naturally explained by assuming t h a t  thesyntax never got a chance to apply to the sentence, due to thefact  t h a t  Pattern Matching resulted in an acceptable reading.Let me now di scuss  these  Linking Strategies in more d e t a i l .The first type was Linking by Variable Type, which is s t a t e din (24).
(24)  Linking by Variable T n e :(1) Link the head-variable of each SR-prefix to theINB-argument of t h e  a~oronriate t e  providedthere is only  one eugn appropriate MVB-argument,and is not  already linked to some o t h e r  variahl Ain the SR-matrix;(2) if Y is an Bvent-variable .I e then add - e=X,  where Xis MVB plus i t s  modi f i er s  and arguments;( 3 )  if n is a predicate variable then substitute f o rF MVB and its arguments.LThis rule says to link t h e  "head-variable" ( L e a ,  theleft-moet variable) of each pref ix  to the  PNB argument whichmatches its type.
Opt ion  (2) spec i f i e s  t h a t  event-variablesare linked to the event descr ibed  by t h e  main predicate1 andoption ( 3 )  deals with certain adverbs l i k e  slbwlw or softlv.The rule will be explained usine the  example (25) .
(25) (a) #Yesterday t h e  f a t h 5 r  of t h e  boy sang + #horribly# in the bath 4.
(b) PSR: (THE~~:YSSTE&~~)[THEXI(TH~~:BOY~)(FATHERX~)J(E t2aPAST tZ) (E x*)(E P)(E e )  (TIIEZ: BATH%)E ~ I N c ~ ~ x ~ ~ ~  & HORRIBLY(?)
& INez 1Looking at (25b), the  PSR f o r  sentence (25a), it can beseen that t h e  variables in t h e  prefixes a r e  of severaldifferent ty~es; there a r e  t h e  time-variables 4 and t2,individual-variables IC, y, 2, e t c  .
, a predicate-variable ',and an event-variable The main verb (M3) is SING, and i t sarguments are a and Kow, time-variables can o n l y  be linkedto other  tkxhe-variables, and these links have the s p e c i f i cform ~ E Y B  ("time-of-tne-YXB is included in tirne-of -the-prefix" ) , in our  cabe t~ c Cl.
Next there  ie anindividual-variable JC, which matches o n l y  t h e  ma-argumenthence the link is x=x,m Then there is t h e  predicate-variableF which, according to option ( 3 )  of t h e  strategy, is rep laced-by iWB p l u s  i ts  arguments, yielding the combined reading -H-(SIN G%nally,  the  event-variable p $s linkedto t h e  entire event d e s c r i b e d  by the main predicate, namelyt h a t  x2 sari(: horribly at t i m e  t21 p=tlO8RIBLY ( S I N G X ~ ~ )  T h i sexgands the matrix of (25b) i n t o  (26) , giving us, aftersimplification, the final 3R (27) f o r  (25a).The entire procedure is eyntax-free, with one qualificationtthe constituent correepond1ng to the pain verb is marked inthe semantic repreeentation by a oonresponding featureThat is.
SING in (25b) is marked as WVlulVB T h i s  syntacticfeature is immediately copied f r o m  the syntactic structurei n t o  the semantic one$ where it is preserved until t h eentire sentence has been processed.For many constituent types, Linking by Variable Type isthe o n l y  Linking Strategy that is needed.
This is truep a r t i c l ~ l a r l y  for adverbs, temporal phrases like last Octbber ,PrepP l i k e  into the garden, and auxiliary verbs l i k e  w i l l .
-In addition, if a, clause has only one nuclear noun phrase,as 2s the case in sentence (25a), then the entire interpretationfs normal ly  taken care  of by t h i s  strategy#The next strategy was Pattern M*tching, which is statedin (28).
It says t h a t  if c e r t a i n  clause constituents matcha pattern, then they are linked as in the pattern.

Hence they a r e  linked as in (34 ) ,  yielding,after simplification, the  f i n d  SR (35).Finally, 3 describes the svntax-sensitive rule.

Some aspectsof the thapry I have j u s t  sketched may n o t  be optimal for a~omputational model, even though they seem appropriate fora psychological model .
For instance, to a pefson engaged innormal conversation accuracy of understanding is not  verycrucial  most of t h e  t i m e "  Often, the  goal may only be to'-get the essentials," and if some mistake & s  made, it issimply corrected l a t e r  on.This "normal mode of processingw is what the psychologicalmodel sets out to describe.
Now, in the case of an artificiali n t e l l i ~ r t n c e  system, one would probably demand h i g h e r  accuracy,so as to minimize the need f o r  correctionsm T h i s  is, in someways* similar to t h e  s i t u a t i o n  where you p u t  subjects in apsychulinguistic experiment.
They usual ly  abandon the "normalmode of processingw very soon and instead employ the strategiesthat guarantee best performance for the s p e c i f i c  experimentaltask they are faced w i t h  .
To give an example, consider thecommon type of experiment where a subject has to verifysentences l i k e  those in 138).
(38a) 5 precedes 13.
(38b) 5 is preceded by 13.
( 3 8 4  13 is preceded by 5 .In o r d e r  to i n t e r p r e t  such sentences c o r r e c t l y ,  h i sknowledge t ha t  5 in f a c t  precedes 13 is of no help whatsoeverto the listener, because true sentences occuf toge ther  w i t hfalse ones in this game.
Therefore, he will soon drop allsemantic short cuts --which he normally eaploys--  andinterpret the sentences purely on the basis of their syntax.In a way, therefore, such experiments do n o t  rea l ly  t e l l  usanything about normal speech processing.Still, such conditions o'f heightened aecuracy may be justthe onee we want to apply to the artificial i n t e l l i gencesystem.
Let us therefore consider how such a non-normal modeof processing could be s inulated in our t heory .Now, looking back at the Linking Strategies in (22) above(~lnking by Variable Type, Pattern latching, C o n t r a d i c t i n n -Xlimination, Canonical Order, ana Syntax-sensitive M V B - ~ u l e ) ,there is indeed ar.
obvious way of simulating the "high accuracyprocedure," namely by dropping type 2, 3 ,  and 4 strategies.
'Phese c o f l s t i t u t e  the " s h o r e  cuts" which work 90% of the t i m e ,but sometimes l ead  to misinterpretations.
Notice that theresult is still not a syntax-governed model, because mostof the linking would s t i l l  be handled by the syntax-freene'chod of Linking4by Variable Type, and syntactic btruc tare~ o u l d  s t i l l  be erased in clause-intervals, As a matter offact, in this last respect I th ink  it is possible to g o  evenfurther than I have done here, and erase syntactic s t r u c t u r ea f t e r  each major clause constituent (i.e., after each NP,adverb, or main verb), retaining only its functional feature,which is then simply integrated into the semantic representatbn.I have already done t h i s  here for the  constituent ~ a i n ~ e r ~ ,s o  in a way t h i s  woula o n l y  be a l og i ca l  extension of myproposal Looking at t h e  syntax-sensitive MVB-Rule ( 3 6 )  ,it is evident that it rerers exactly to those functionalfeatures, namely SBJ, O B J 1 ,  O B J 2 ,  MVB, and AGT.It would seem, then, that even for purposes of artific ' ialin%ll igence ,  it  may be preferable to operate w i t h  a p a r a l l e lprocessing model ,  thereby minimizing t h e  size of the  syntacticgltructl~re and the amount o f  syn tac t i c  operat ions .Apart from this, I would like to argue t h a t  t h e  essentialingredients.
of Pattern Matching and Contradiction-Eliminationare still required for any adequaze t J l e o ~ .
W s - b r i ~ gback to the  sixth type of Semantic Linking Strategies,namely Alternative Linking Strategies.I X s W A L T E R N A T N E  LINKING STRATEGIES"Alternative Linking Strategies apply if t h e  normalstrategies (types 1-51 have failed to produce a semanticallyacceptable reading.
These strategies r e l y  heavily on theSemantic Knowledge Rules.The most important a n d  m o s t  general (and the only one tobe discussed in the present paper) is the Obvious ConnectionStrategy in ( 3 9 ) .
It says, roughly, that  if a variable gcannot be linked to the R n B  then if the  encyclopedia containsa rule conne~ting q to same o the r  entity 11' then try and linkt h i s  n e w  entity yo to the MVB.

"SchankDs theory is baqed on wconceptual casesw and lexicaldecomposition rather than meaning postulates.
For instance,he claims that "John would be pleased by Il:ary8s going" isa proper part of the  meanhg of John wants Marv to come home,while  in my terms "John would be pleased by !daryw s going"is merely an allowable inference which may or may n o t  bedrawn.
Failure to Eraw an allowable inference explains t h epossibility of holding contradictory b e l i e f s  .
For instance,somebody m i g h t  judge John's uncle left to be true ,  w h i l e  atthe same t i m e  believing t h a t  t h e  brother o f  John's mother orfather left was false, because he failed to apply t h emean%% rule relating uncle and brother of mother or f a t h e r .It is difficult to see how a theory b a s e d o n  l ex ica ldecomposition would explain such f&c ts Certa inly  , it w o u l dbe unreasonable to claim that a person has not understoodthe sentence John's uncleJaft unless he a l s o  is aware ofthe synonymy relation between t h i s  sentence and the b r o t h e rof John's mother or father  Leftbe recal led,  is t h a t  s y n t a c t i c  structure is erased clause-by-clause.

The exception i st h e  feature MVB, and it was suggested earlier that thissyntactic feature i s  integrated into the semantic representationNotice a l s o  that certain aspects of syntactic structure arereboverable from our semantic representations.
For instance,the order of the  prefixes in the SR r e f l ec t s  the surfaceorder of the NP'a of a clause.
Hence, if certain constructionsrequire access to such syntactic aspects, this i8 s t i l l  n o tincompatible with erasure of  syntactic structure in clauseintervals.

)X - I  r THE "TEMPORAL SEQUENCE STEIATEGY "The last strategy discussed here concerns t h e  tense ofconsecutive clauses.
When we interpret sentences S1, 52 ina t e x t  or sentence conjunct, where S3, and S2 have the sametense, we of ten  assign a relative chrondlogy to the eventsdescribed by these sentences.
I will refer to the principleassigning such a chronology as the  Temporal Sequence Strategy.For example, consider (46) (Agatha Chris t ie ,  Thev came toBaghdad, pmlOO)t( 4 6 )  Then h i s  head jerkedtl back a little and he l a y  s t i l l .t2Assigning  PAST(^^) t o  the f irst  clause and  PAST(^^) t o  theconjoined clause in (46) does not account for actualcomprehension: the listener knows that t2 is later than tl,even though there is no overt sequewe marker ( e  s g * ,  before,after, then)A s  a first approximation, the strategy might be sta ted  asf 011 ows t(47 ) Tem~oral Sequence stratem (preliminary) IGiven t w o  main or conjoined clauses C1, C2 such t h a tC1 precedes C2 and t h e  t i m e  tl of C 1  has t h e  same"tense predicatew ( e .

F i r s t ,  the ruleholds f o r  certain nan-tensed clauses as well, as illustratedby (48) (~hesr came- to Baghdad p 044) 8(48) Then he was o u t ,  across the Khan, back into the Suq.
.The f u l l  interpretation of (48) must specify that t h e  t i m e  ofo u t  precedes that  of acrcws, which in t u r n  precedes that of-bacq.
Since across and back had no overt tense predicate in7i48), the strategy must somehow be Liberalized to includeS U C ~  C ~ S ~ S .In t h i s  connection, consider a l s o  (49)(~hey came to Baghdad.pa711 1(49) Never.

-DIRPREC t2 & _t3 DIRPREC t3).Next, t h e  Temporal Sequence Strategy seems blocked ifsome general semantic principles \in ~ a r t i c u l a r ,  PatternMatching) suggest a chronology caR#licting with that imposedby the Temporal Sequence Strategy.
For instance, considera dialogue like (50):(50a) What's the matter with John?
(50b\ Oh, he broketl h i s  a r m .
H e  f e l l t Z  off his bike.Here the second sentence in (sob) is interpreted aspreceding the first sentence in (50b) temporally, counter t owhat the Temporal Sequence Strategy would prediict.
The reasonis obviousr there is a perceived causal connection betweenthe sentences, such that the second sentence describes thecause of the first.
Since a cause must precede its e f f e c t ,t2 must precede tl in (50b).To formalize t h i s ,  we can make use of  Pattern ittcbing.For  instance, the encyclopedia would contain a pat tern  like(51), and there  would furthermore be a meaning ru l e  like (52).

43 IMPL tl CIRPREC t2 3We need only make sure t h a t  the pattern (51) is activatedby the two sentences he broke his a r m  and he f e l l  o f f  h i s  bikein ( ~ o B ) ,  which can be- done by cal l ing up all patterns whicha r e  in the intersection of the  main verbs of the two sentences.pa or instance, break and f e l l  both point t o  (51).)
In e f f e c t ,we have to add t h e  fo l lowing  principle to t h e  Temporal SequenceStrategyr(53) Causal Connection Constraint:If C1, C 2  a r e  not conjoined by p d ,  c a l l  up a l lEncyclopedic Rules in the intersection of t h e  MVBVsof C1 and C2.
If 4 DIRPREC tl is heuristically derivablefrom a pattern, then add t h i s  link tu C2 and do notapply t h e  Temporal Sequence Strategy.
11Another restriction seems to be that the  Temporal SequenceStrategy is inapplicable to proaess ive  tense.
For instance,while tl must precede t, in ( 5 4 ) ,  they seem to be roughly-simi~ltaneous in (59, even though l i a t i n a  a c i ~ m e t t e  andleaving a room normally count as "instantaneous" events (see11 The condition against conjunction by and is necessary sincepnd can never mean "and before tha t .

Hence no temporalsequence is imoosed on stood and looked.
By contrast, in (57)( ~ h e u  came to Baghdad, p.76)  wen3 and stood must be interpretedas seqyenced, since one .cannot at the s a m e  t i m e  a somewhereand stand somewhere elser(57) She wenttl out from the bar onto the terrace outsideand stood% by the railing... 2Note that it will not do to d e f i n e .

Unless tl t2 is derivable(s t r icr t ly  or heuristically) the Temporal SequenceStra tegy  is inapplicableThere a r e  some cases, however, where two events arenocmally ihterpreted as sequenced, even though they could,stric-tly speaking, be sirnultaneous~ For instance, it istheoretically possible to l i g h t  a cigarette while g&tting up,and one certainly would not  want to add a rule  to t heencyclopedia stating t h a t  two such events are unlikely to be'sinnaltaneo~s~ Nonetheless, (61) is normally interpreteda8 sequences I(61) John got up and lit a cigarette.Aather than adding some ad hoc principle whlch somehowcodes  the  intuition t h a t  it i s  awkward to s t r i k e  a match andhold it to the cigarette while geteing up, we can exnlaint h i s  as a consequence of a much more general heuristicprinciple.
N o t i d e  t h a t  both clauses of ( 61 ) describeinstantaneous events.
Now, the shorter t d o  events, t h e  lowerthe probability t h a t  they coincidel For instance, theprobability that the radio plays at t h e  same t i m e  when thereis a- s ho t  is duch higher than the probability of t h e r e  beinga s h o t  at the same time w i ~ h  a hiccough.
