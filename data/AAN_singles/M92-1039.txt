Prior to MUC-4, LINK hadbeen used to extract information from free-form texts in two narrow application domains .
Oneapplication corpus contained terse descriptions of symptoms displayed by malfunctioning auto-mobiles, and the repairs which fixed them .
The other corpus described sequences of activitiesto be performed on an assembly line .
In empirical testing in these two domains, LINK correctlyprocessed 70% of previously unseen descriptions .
A template was counted as correct only if allof the fillers in the template were filled correctly .
In addition, LINK generated incomplete (butnot incorrect) templates for another 15% of the descriptions .These previous domains were much narrower than the MUC-4 terrorism domain .
As a com-parison, the lexicons for the previous domains contained only 300-500 words, compared wit h6700 words in our MUC-4 test configuration .
Previous grammar size ranged from 75-100 rules ,compared with over 500 rules in the MUC-4 knowledge base .
In addition, the previous applica-tion domains consisted only of single-sentence inputs .
Thus, the integration of information frommultiple sentences was not an issue in our previous work .Flow of controlThe MUC-4 LINK system consists of the modules shown in figure 1 .
One sentence at atime passes through the modules in the order shown in the figure .
Each module's function i sdescribed below .
To help explain the role of each module, its performance on various parts o fmessage TST2-MUC4-0048 is shown .The tokenizerThe tokenizer produces LISP-readable files from a 100-article source file .
It also performs afew simple editing tasks, such as separating the text into sentences, and removing text that i sin brackets .The filterThe filter determines which sentences in an article should be passed to the remainder of th esystem for processing .
While we originally had in mind more sophisticated filtering techniques ,the filter in the test configuration simply passed on any sentences containing one or more word s289Targe tTemplate sFigure 1 : Modules of the MUC-4 LINK systemwhose definitions were deemed interesting.
Interesting definitions included any word meanin gany of the template actions (BOMBING, ATTACK, .
.
.)
as well as a few other concepts likely t oappear as template fillers, such as EXPLOSIVE and HOSTAGE .
Any sentence which did notcontain any words whose definitions were deemed interesting were discarded and not processe dfurther .The preprocessorThe preprocessor is responsible for initializing the environment in which the LINK parse roperates .
Since LINK is a bottom-up chart parser, this means that the preprocessor mustinitialize the chart .
The initialization is constructed by looking up each word in the sentence ,and adding a link into the chart corresponding to each possible sense of a word .
In addition ,likely noun phrases are identified and grouped together, and NP links are entered into the char tfor these groups of words .Noun phrases are preidentified for two reasons .
First, undefined words often appear as partsof noun phrases.
The grouping of these unidentified words eliminates the need to deal with themin the parser itself .
Second, preprocessing noun phrases enabled us to encode parsing heuristic sin the preprocessor which could not easily be encoded in the parser itself, such as preferring th elongest possible noun phrase .
This improves the efficiency of the system.Each link in the initial chart contains both syntactic and semantic information about aword or noun phrase .
For a single word, this semantic information is simply copied from th edefinition of the word .
For noun phrases, semantic information on a link is the result of unifying,or merging together, semantic information from all of the defined words in the noun phrase .Adjacent nouns whose definitions cannot unify are not grouped together into a single nounphrase by the preprocessor .
For example, "government headquarters" is not initially grouped as290a single NP, since the meanings of "government" and "headquarters" cannot be unified .
Thus,it might be more accurate to say that the preprocessor identifies "noun clusters " rather thannoun phrases .If all of the words of an NP are undefined, then a default semantic definition is assigned .For the test configuration of the system, the default definition was HUMAN-OR-PLACE, adefinition which could be refined during processing to be any of the set fills for the HUM TGT ,PHYS TGT, or LOCATION fields .The preprocessor is also responsible for identifying names of people .
A list of names thatappeared in the HUM TGT : NAME fields of the MUC-3 development answer keys is used toidentify names, along with a few simple heuristics for identifying likely additional names .
Forexample, any undefined word ending in a `z ' is considered a potential name .Here are the results produced by the preprocessor for the first sentence in article TST2 -MUC4-0048 .
The initial chart is displayed, with potential noun phrases already grouped to-gether :Next sentence (1) : SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNE DTHE TERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO ANDACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF THE CRIMEPreprocessor results :Node 0 : (SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI )Node 1 : CONDEMNEDNode 2 : (THE TERRORIST)Node 3 : (KILLING) KILLIN GNode 4 : OFNode 5 : ((ATTORNEY GENERAL) ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO )Node 6 : ANDNode 7 : ACCUSE DNode 8 : (THE (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) )Node 9 : OFNode 10 : (THE CRIME )Node 11 :The LINK parserLINK is a bottom-up, unification-based chart parser .
Its grammar rules are quite similar inform to those used in PATR-II (Shieber, 1986) .
We have incorporated semantic information int oLINK's grammar, along the lines of HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987) .
The integration of syntacti cand semantic knowledge into the same grammar formalism is crucial to our system's ability t oprocess large texts in a reasonable length of time, and to producing the semantic analysis use dto generate templates .Here is a simplified example of a constraint rule :291(define-class S(1) = NP <1>(2) = VP <2>(head) = (2 head) <3>(head agr) = (1 head agr) <4>(head rep actor) = (1 head rep)) <5>Each equation in this rule specifies a property which .
any node labeled S must have .
Aproperty consists of a path, or a sequence of arcs with the appropriate labels starting fromthe node in question ; and a value, which is another node to be found at the end of the path.Equations specify the values of properties in one of two ways .
They may specify the label of th enode to be found at the end of the path, as in equations 1 and 2 (i .e ., the arc from an S nodelabeled 1 leads to a node labeled NP) .
We will call these labeling equations.
Or, they may specifythat two paths must lead to the identical node, as in equations 3-5 .
Identity here is defined bythe unification operation ; i .e, if two paths must lead to the identical node, then the nodes a tthe end of the two paths must unify.
Unification merges the properties of two nodes ; thus, twopaths can unify if their values have no properties which explicitly contradict each other .
Theseequations will be called unifying equations.Links are placed in the chart to represent potential constituents that the parser identifies .These links contain both syntactic and semantic information, represented in the form of adirected acyclic graph (DAG) .
The DAGs correspond to the information in the set of gramma rrules used to build a constituent .The core of the grammar is a set of domain-independent rules that handle all regular ver btenses, and many of the simple english constructions .
The rules encode both syntactic an dsemantic constraints, which allows much of the work of finding the actor, object, location, etc .to be done during the parse .The core is augmented by a set of rules that handle common constructions from the 130 0MUC-3 development articles .
Typical examples of this are "Meanwhile, [sentence] ."
or " .
.
.anattack on [place] .
.
.
", and are handled in as general a rule as possible provided the correctsemantics may be given the parent based on the semantics of the children .
An example of agrammar rule for a specific type of construction is shown below .
(define-class S((1) = PRON(2) = VP2-PASS(3) = THAT(4) = S(1 1) = it(2 head rep) = strans(head) = (2 head)(head rep object) = (4 head rep)) )This rule handles all constructions of the form "It has been said that [sentence]" or "It wa sreported by the government today that [sentence]," etc .Although the preprocessor is responsible for finding simple noun phrases, the correct inter-pretation of complex NPs relies on semantics and is handled by a set of grammar rules for NPs .292INJUREDESTROYSHOOTAMBUSHATTACK(ACTOR) = HUMAN-OR-ORG(OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-PLACETERRORIST-ACTKIDNAPPING(OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-OFFICIALROBBERYHIJACKINGMURDER(OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-OFFICIALARSONFigure 2 : The ATTACK subtree of the concept hierarchy of actions for the terrorism domai nThese include past particples used as adjectives (e .g., "the kidnapped priests"); noun phrasecomplements (e .g ., "Noriega, the president of Panama") and some noun-noun constructions(e .g ., "government headquarters" or "FMLN terrorists") .If a sentence fails to parse completely, the chart can be inspected to see what constituent shave been constructed, and what their semantic content is .
Thus, after a failed parse, thesystem examined the chart, identifying those links which contained information relevant tothe construction of templates .
Links which contained the most relevant information (i .e ., thegreatest number of slots filled which could map to template fields) were selected and passed t othe postprocessor for incorporation into templates .An example parse of sentence 1 from article TST2-MUC4-0048 is shown below .
((SENTENCE 1) "actionl "((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF MURDER) )(ACTOR (SEM-REF TERRORIST) (ACT-WORD (TERRORIST)) )(OBJECT (SEM-REF GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL) (ACT-WORD (ATTORNEY GENERAL) )(NAME (ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO)))) )The Inheritance HierarchyThe LINK parser utilizes semantic/domain knowledge during processing .
This informationis organized in an inheritance hierarchy.
Figure 2 presents the actions from the hierarchy used i nthe MUC-4 domain, along with constraints on fillers of slots for actions .
Slot-filling constraintson a concept may either be defined for that concept or inherited from the concept's ancestor sin the tree .
For example, since ATTACK requires an OBJECT that is a HUMAN-OR-PLACE ,this restriction also implicitly holds for actions like SHOOT and ROBBERY .
KIDNAPPIN Gis an example of a concept which makes a further restriction on a previously constrained slot .HUMAN-OR-OFFICIAL, the OBJECT of this action, must be a descendant of HUMAN-OR-PLACE.293The PostprocessorThe postprocessor receives semantic representations from the LINK parser for each sentenc ein an article, and is responsible for producing response templates .
It first checks to see ifthe representation of a sentence can be added to an existing template, or if it requires a ne wtemplate .
This decision is based on the compatibility of several template fields : the DATE ,LOCATION, INCIDENT CATEGORY, and INDIVIDUAL ID fields .
If all of these fields ar ecompatible, then additional information is added to an existing template ; otherwise, a newtemplate is constructed .To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the postprocessor, we will examine the pro-cessing of article TST2-MUC4-0048.
Several sentences in this article generated templates .
Hereare the results produced by the LINK parser for sentences 1 and 2 :Sentence 1 : SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNED TH ETERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AND ACCUSE DTHE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF THE CRIME((SENTENCE 1) actions((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF MURDER) )(ACTOR (SEM-REF TERRORIST) (ACT-WORD (TERRORIST)) )(OBJECT (SEM-REF GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL) (ACT-WORD (ATTORNEY GENERAL) )(NAME (ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO)))) )Sentence 2 : LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VIC EPRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO ALSO DECLARED THAT THE DEATH OF TH EATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CAUSED BY WHAT VALDIVIESO TERMED THE GUERRILLAS 'IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE((SENTENCE 2) actions((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF DIE) )(RESULT action2 ((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF NIL))) )(LOCATION (SEM-REF NIL) )(OBJECT (SEM-REF GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL) (ACT-WORD (ATTORNEY GENERAL)))) )The templates for these sentences are merged, since the OBJECT of both actions appear t obe the same person .Later in the article, the following sentence appears :Sentence 11 : GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AG OWITH EXPLOSIVES294((SENTENCE 11) action!
((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF ATTACK) )(ACTOR (SEM-REF TERRORIST) (ACT-WORD (GUERRILLAS)) (NUM PLURAL) )(INSTRUMENT (SEM-REF EXPLOSIVE) (ACT-WORD (EXPLOSIVES)) )(TIME (NUM 14) (MONTH APR) (SEM-REF DATE) )(OBJECT (SEM-REF CIVILIAN-RESIDENCE) (ACT-WORD (MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR) )(LOCATION (SEM-REF CITY) (ACT-WORD (SAN SALVADOR) )(COUNTRY EL-SALVADOR) (NAME (SAN-SALVADOR))))) )This information is not merged with the template generated from sentence 1 because of th emismatch between the OBJECTs of the two representations .Sentence 22 illustrates the inability of our system to perform reference resolution :Sentence 22 : ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED((SENTENCE 22) action!
((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF DIE))) )Because the referent of `them' cannot be resolved, it is dropped from the representation of th esentence, and the result is that no information is added to the response templates for this article .ReferencesPollard, C., and Sag., I .
