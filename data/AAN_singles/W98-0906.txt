Loanword formation: a neural network approachAlan D. Blairblair@cs.uq.edu.auJohn Ingramjingram@lingua.cltr.uq.edu.auDepartment of Computer Scienceand Electrical EngineeringDepartment of EnglishUniversity of Queensland, 4072, AustraliaAbstractLoanword phonology seeks to model theprocess by which foreign words are 'nativised'or incorporated into the phonological systemof the 'borrowing' language.
We can conceiveof this as a parsing of the phonetic inputprovided by the foreign word forms, inaccordance with phonological outputconstraints of the borrowing language.Following Silverman (1992) we conceiveloanword formation as fundamentally a two-stage process: the first of which yields aparsing of the phonetic input into segmentallyorganised phonetic feature bundles,interpretable as segmental targets in theborrowing language.
In the second stage ofprocessing, these segmental targets are parsedinto phonological structures ( yllables, mora,feet...etc) compatible with the word-prosodyof the borrowing language.Japanese borrowings from English provide agood test-bed for models of loanwordformation, because examples are abundantand, while the segmental mapping fromEnglish to Japanese is relativelystraightforward, their respective word-levelprosodies are strikingly different, providingample opportunity to observe prosodic re-structuring in loanword formation.to construct 'symbolic' or 'analytical' parsingalgorithms for this task, either with or withoutreference to a framework of learnabilitytheory.
This approach came under strongchallenge from 'empirical' Connectionistmodels of language processing in the 1980's.The debate between these competingparadigms, or the search for some suitable'hybrid', continues.
It may be argued thatloanword formation provides a morerestrictive, and hence better controlled,environment for studying parsing mechanismsthan other natural language processing tasks,which involve a host of lexical,morphological, syntactic or pragmaticinfluences.In this paper, we report he results obtainedfrom a feed-forward neural network, trainedon an 1100 word corpus of American Englishloanwords "borrowed' into Japanese, post-WWII.
We make preliminary comparisonswith an analytical constraint-based approachto modeling loanword formation.An intended application for the NN parser,was to devise an English-Japanese proper orplace-name translator, which would map anEnglish phoneme sequence into Katakana(e.g.
: Brisbane/brIzbOn/=> 7" ,J z" ~," :, ).The theoretical aim of this study is toinvestigate he learning mechanisms requiredfor phonological parsing in loanwordformation.
Phonologists have typically soughtIntroductionThe Japanese language has borrowedthousands of words from English, particularlysince World War II, under the overwhelming45economic and cultural influence of the UnitedStates.
This massive borrowing over acomparatively short period of time provides aunique window on processes of loanwordformation.
Borrowed words may reflectvarying degrees of nativisation to thephonological patterns of the borrowinglanguage.While the segments and phonetic features ofEnglish words tend to be remarkably wellpreserved by the process of loanwordformation, the resulting Japanese word formsare so completely transformed in terms oftheir prosodic structure that English listenersalmost invariably fail to recognize theirEnglish sources, when loanwords arepresented to them as isolated words carefullyspoken by a native speaker of Japanese(Ingram, 1998).
The main factor underlyingpoor recognition of the English source wordsappears to lie in the extensiveresyllabification, involving vowel epenthesis,which is required to parse the segmental inputinto Japanese prosodic frames.
Someexamples are given below:orthographic phonemic JapaneseOlympic olimpik oriNpikkutruck trak torakkucut kat kattocud kad kadocart kart kaatocat kmt kJattoJapanese syllable structure is predominantlyCV, lacking complex onsets and codas.
Tomaintain faithful representation of thesegment structure of the English source words,extensive use is made of the epenthetic vowels(chiefly, ha/, /o/ and /I/).
The temporalstructure of the English source word isconverted to Japanese moraic timing.
Englishtense (long) vowels and diphthongs areusually treated as two-mora units, whereas lax(short) vowels are assigned to a single mora.
(Stress pattern in the English source wordplays a moderating role.
Tense vowels ordiphthongs in unstressed syllables mayemerge as one-mora vowels, as in Olympic\[ollmptk\].
)English voiceless obstruents following a laxvowel are almost always treated as geminate(two mora) stops.
But voiced obstruentsusually do not geminate in this environment inloanword formation.
Also, if the precedingvowel is tense (long) in the English sourceword, gemination of voiceless obstruents doesnot occur in the loanword.
The reasons forthese timing changes need not concern ushere.The segmental mapping from the Englishsource word to segments in the Japanese loansis basically one-for-one, without any featureexchange between adjacent segments.
Thereare some palatalized consonants in Japaneseborrowings which appear to 'pick up' thepalatalization feature from the followingvowel (see, cat above).
However, this feature-swapping between adjacent segments occursonly under quite restrictive conditions.
Notethat Japanese has no sound which correspondsto the low front English/~e/.
We hypothesisethat Japanese listeners respond to the 'palatal'quality of English /m/, by relocating thisfeature onto the preceding consonant, herebyregularizing the foreign phonetic contrast oJapanese phonemics.The examples given above illustrate the majorphonological transformations required to parseEnglish source words into English loanwordsin Japanese, within the limits of a phonemictranscription.
Implicit in these46transformations, though they are not explicitlycaptured by the phonemic representation, arethe contrasting prosodic structures, such assyllable structure constraints, which motivatethe transformations.Modeling loanword formationIn an 'analytic' account of loanwordformation, these prosodic onstraints would beexplicitly represented in the form of re-writerules, filters or constraints on well-formednessfor particular aspects of prosodic structure.The output of parsing would take the form ofassignment of an explicit prosodic phrasemarker.
By contrast, in a NN based account ofloanword formation, the details of prosodicfeature assignment are not explicitlyrepresented, but are typically regarded asemergent features, contained in the weight-states of the trained network.
The NNdemonstrates acquisition of the prosodicconstraints on word formation by being able totransform phonetic segments and features ofinput source words into well-formedphonemic sequences in the borrowinglanguage.
(The further step of transformingJapanese phonemic representations intoKatakana script is trivial.
)In a complete model of loanword formation, itwould of course be necessary to specify moreprecisely how the stage I extraction ofphonetic segments and features from thespeech signal is achieved and what perceptualfiltering takes place on the segmental phoneticproperties of foreign words as processedthrough the ear of the native listener.
Theseinitial auditory representations are not, strictlyspeaking, sequences of phonemic segments orfeatures.
Rather, they are likely to beevanescent and somewhat fragmentary, madeup of phoneme-like segments and 'foreign'phonetic features of sufficient auditorysaliency that they cannot be ignored by theperceptual mechanism.However, for purposes of modeling stage IIprocesses of loanword formation, whether ananalytical or a statistical NN model is adopted,an initial segmental parsing of the input wordinto sequences of phoneme-like featurebundles was assumed (see Appendix I for thesegments and features used).The DatabaseWe compiled a database of 1100 words froma dictionary of neologisms borrowed mainlyfrom American usage in the post-war era(Bailey, 1962).The English phonemic transcriptions of thesewords were obtained from the CarnegieMellon Pronouncing Dictionary( ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/project/fgdata/dict/)which generally reflects American rather thanBritish pronunciation.Network architectureWe use a two-layer feed-forward neuralnetwork with 65 inputs, 20 hidden units and53 outputs.
A featural representation isemployed for the (English) input and aphonemic representation for the (Japanese)output.
This architecture was inspired byNETtalk (Sejnowski & Rosenberg, 1987)although the task performed is, in a sense, thereverse of that performed by NETtalk, sincethe latter used an orthographic representationfor its input and a featural representation forits output.If the aim of the exercise were to model theway humans leam the task of loanwordformation, it would be more appropriate totrain the network on some task involving onlythe target language, prior to testing it on inputfrom the source language.
In that scenario, thetraining task would presumably involvederiving the correct surface form from somehypothesised underlying structure.
However,many choices and assumptions would need tobe made in order to devise an appropriate47framework and representation for theseunderlying structures.
By avoiding suchchoices, our approach as the advantage ofallowing phonological constraints to bestudied in a more canonical context.
But itmeans that the network is really performing acomposite task, since it can make use of theconstraints and statistics of the sourcelanguage as well as those of the borrowinglanguage.The 65 inputs are divided into 5 groups of 13,which encode the phonological features of thecurrent phoneme, the two preceding phonemesand the two following phonemes (13 featuresx 5 phonemes =65 inputs in all).The featural input representation has severaladvantages over a phonemic one:(1)(2)(3)it reduces the number of inputs,features often influence the form ofloanwords in a systematic way,the same word is often rendereddifferently in different dialects (forexample, British vs. AmericanEnglish) and the featuralrepresentation is less sensitive to thisthan a phonemic one would be.Input and output phonemes do not alwayscorrespond on a 1-to-1 basis.
In some cases aphoneme may be deleted, or it may have aconsonant and/or a vowel appended to it.
Inorder to allow for these possibilities, wedivide the outputs of our network into threegroups.
The first group has one output foreach possible phoneme (consonant or vowel);the second group has one output for eachpossible consonant; he third group has oneoutput for each possible vowel.
Each grouphas one additional output representing the"empty' phoneme "_".
Since there are 20consonants and 5 vowels in Japanese, the totalnumber of outputs is 26+21 +6=53.For example, consider the English word catwhich has the phonemic representation/k~et/and becomes/kjatto/in Japanese.
The networkviews this as three separate training items:__k~et  => k j _k~et => ak~et => t toThis means that the network, when presentedwith the features encoding the input/__k~et/,should be trained to produce an activation of1.0 for the/k/output of the first group, the/j/output of the second group and the/_/(empty)output of the third group (and an activation of0.0 for the other 50 outputs).When it comes to the testing phase, withineach group the output with the largestactivation is selected, and this determines thethree-phoneme sequence chosen by thenetwork to correspond with the salient inputphoneme.The networks were trained byback-propagation (Rumelhart et al, 1986) for100 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.01 and amomentum of 0.9.
The cross-entropyminimization criterion was used.ResultsEach of 11 networks was trained on 1000words from the database, and tested on theother lO0 words.
Each word occurred in thetest set of exactly one network.The 1100 words in the database had anaverage of 8.8 phonemes per word, making atotal of 9658 input phonemes.

In our data set, the headphoneme was nonempty 97% of the time,while the added consonant and added vowelwere nonempty only 4% and 17% of the time,respectively, so the network error is muchsmaller for the latter two groups.
After 30epochs the training and test errors,respectively, reach a level of 7.4% (resp.9.9%) for the head phoneme, 1.1% (resp.

After this, thetraining error continues to fall while the testerror levels off.
(Note: the test error wascomputed at the end of each epoch, while thetraining error was computed uring the epoch.Therefore the training error may exceed thetest error in the first few epochs.
)Error  Ana lys i sAn analysis was undertaken of all 'errors':cases where there was a discrepancy betweenthe romanji (Japanese Romanized)representation of a loan word and thephonemic representation assigned by the fullytrained network, when the item in questionwas not included in the training set.
These aresummarised inTable 1.

English tensevowels and diphthongs should be perceived aslong (two mora) vowels in Japanese.However, stress and position in the word mayact as moderating influences.
In primarystressed position English vowels arelengthened, while reduced vowels inunstressed syllables may be very short.Therefore, tense English vowels in unstressedposition may not be perceived as long(bimoraic) by Japanese listeners.An analysis o f  discrepancies between thenetwork predictions and the romanji assignedvowel durations (Table 2) revealed that only13% o f  cases (example \[1\]) could beaccounted for by shortening of  a tense vowelin an unstressed syllable.Table 2.

We arepresently unable to account for this behaviourof the network.
In 13% of cases (2\[5.\]) vowellength discrepancies could be sourced toirregular romanization on the part of thecompilers of the Japanese dictionary, or toerrors of vowel length phonemicization in thethe American dictionary (7%, 2\[6\]).
Theinfluence of English spelling could be clearlyseen in the romanji forms in 3% of cases: e.g.,advantage => adobaNteeJi because age =>eeJI, though the pronunciation \[edv~entI~\]indicates the vowel is short/lax.
In a smallproportion of cases (3%, 2\[7\]) the vowellength discrepancy appeared to be attributableto the network's allowance of three-moravowel sequences within a single syllable(super-heavy syllables), not sanctioned byJapanese syllable structure.Gemination of obstruents:The basic rule of gemination for Englishloanwords is that voiceless obstruentsgeminate following short vowels in stressedsyllables.
Voiced stops also geminateirregularly in this environment.
The mostcommon error of gemination involved thenetwork failing to geminate a voicelessobstruent in the expected environment (Table3, example \[1\]).
But the network alsoinappropriately produced geminates followingan unstressed vowel (312\]), though notconsistently.
We observed that gemination didnot occur in romanji forms derived from aconsonant cluster in the English word (e.g.
:the/k/ in vector does not geminate, becomingRomanji/bekutoru/).
However, this constraintwas not respected by the network (3\[3\]).
Thenetwork occasionally produced geminateconsonants linked to its propensity to shortenvowels (3\[4\]).
Gemination of voicedobstruents was irregular in the Romanizedforms (3\[5,7\]) and consequently in thenetwork output as well (3\[4,5\]).
Nor was thegemination of voiceless obstruents entirelyregular in the romanji forms (3\[9\]).Table 3 Errors of Consonant Gemination*_desired_output_ English-orthography Incidence_actual output_ English-phonemes1.

However,only 39 discrepancies of vowel epenthesiswere observed (an error rate of 3%).51Furthermore, the largest sub-category ofepenthesis errors were related to wordboundaries incompound forms, (see Table 4).Table 4.

Inapproximately 40% of cases, English/el/wasrendered as Romanji 'ei' and in 32% of casesEnglish/ou/converted o the short vowel 'o'in Romanji.
These irregularities inthe romanjirepresentation f the diphthongs/ei/and/ou/are the probable cause of the occasionaldiscrepancies with the network predictions.In summary, the network's performance inpredicting the phonological forms of loanwords in Japanese, was on the whole, verygood, except for the features of vowel qualityin reduced syllables of English words, and inthe prediction of vowel length and consonantgemination i  romanji forms.
Except in thecase of English vowels in reduced syllables,spelling was found to play a subordinate roleto the phonological features of words in thesource language.
Some improvement in theprediction of vowel length, and substantialimprovement in the prediction of consonantgemination may be expected by providing thenetwork access to the locus of primary stressin English words.
We are currentlyinvestigating this.Discuss ionWe confine discussion to observations on themain practical and theortical objectives of thison-going study.
With respect o the goal ofdevising an English-Japanese proper orplace-name translator, which will convertEnglish phonemic representations to romanjior kana forms, we find the resultsencouraging.
With the inclusion of primarystress, and access to orthographicrepresentations for the prediction of vowelquality in reduced syllables, it should bepossible to obtain near optimal performancefor the prediction of romanji or kana forms,given a degree of indeterminism that is presentin loan word dictionary entries.
Precisely howEnglish orthographic information can beincorporated asrequired is a problem that wehave not yet addressed.
For the data set of ourstudy (post-war borrowings of general lexicalitems), it is clear that English spelling plays astrictly subordinate role to the phonetic form,as perceived by the Japanese listener.
There istypically much disagreement amongstJapanese lexicographers on the romanji orkana representations of English place names.This is probably because lack of exposure tothe spoken form promotes greater reliance onthe (highly irregular) English orthographic52representation.With respect to the theoretical goal of thestudy, an anonymous reviewer made thefollowing astute observation: "If the intent isto 'investigate the learning mechanismsrequired for phonological parsing in loanwordformation,' then training on a corpus ofloanwords is a surprising choice, since it isusually assumed that loanword phonology isnot learned separately but is a side effect ofhaving trained on the internal phonology ofthe target language".
In other words, perhapsthere is an irreconcilable conflict between theengineering and scientific goals of the study.The most direct approach to the problem fi'oman engineering perspective is to train theneural network to perform the mappingbetween English phonemic and Japaneseromanji representations.
But this seems clearlythe wrong approach from the perspective ofpsycholinguistic modeling of loan wordfomaation, where we postulate an initial stageof segmental phonetic mapping, subsequentlyconstrained by the word prosody of theborrowing la.nguage.It is certainly true that our NN modeling has atleast simplified some of the processing whichwe hypothesise takes place, firstly in acceptingas input (American) English phonemicrepresentations, where our model postulatesquasi-phonemic segmental representations ithe borrowing language.
We have, in otherwords, fudged on a level of phonetic tophonemic segmental mapping.
This has had ademonstrable, but minor impact on theaccuracy of the network performance.However, the more serious objection that thenetwork should have been trained on nativeJapanese words may be addressed in thefollowing way.
From the perspective ofconstraint satisfaction, we require an inputthat highly over-generates with respect o thetarget forms, but which nevertheless containsall the segmental features to which the outputshould strive to be faithful.
We have notattempted to directly simulate the generativecapacity of GEN, but rather, provided amechanism which ensures that segmentalfaithfulness i met, within the over-generativecapacities of the three segment window of theNN architecture.
In other words, we argue thatby training on the English-Japanese mapping,we have indirectly or approximately simulatedthe over-generative capacity of GEN, whileproviding the network with all (and only) thesegmental phonetic input to which it isrequired to be faithful.
It is not clear to us howthis could be accomplished by trainingexclusively within the target language.However, even if this argument carriesweight, the second theoretical leg of thisstudy remains to be undertaken: theconstruction of an analytical (rule-based)competitor to the NN model, and thesystematic testing of both against thebehaviour of native Japanese speakers'intuitions.
We are grateful for the assistance ofChiharu Tsuratani in providing native speakerassessments of the NN responses.
This testingneeds to be more systematically pursued infurther investigations.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially funded by aUniversity of Queensland Postdoctoralfellowship.ReferencesBailey, D.C., 1962.
