INTRODUCTIONOne of the goals of studies in Distributional Semanticsis the establishment of word classes on the basis of theobserved behavior of words in written texts.
A convenientand significant way of discussing "behavior" of words isin terms of syntactic relationship.
At the outset, infact, it is necessary that we treat a word in terms of itsSyntactically Related Words (SRW).
In a given text, eachword bears a given syntactic relationship to a finite num-ber of other words; e.g., a finite number of words (nounsand pronouns) appear as "subject" for each active verb;another group of nouns and pronouns are used as "directobject" of each transitive verb; other words of the class,"adverb," appear as modifiers of a given verb.
In eachinstance we may speak of the related words as SRW of a givenverb, so that in our example three different ~ of SRWemerge; a given SRW is then defined in terms both of wordclass and specific relationship to the verb.
(A given nounmay of course belong to two different types of SRW, e.g.,as both subject and object of the same verb.
)Distributionally, we may compare two verbs in termsof their SRN.
The objective of the present study is totest the premise that "similar" words tend to have the sameSRW.
This premise is tested, not with verbs, as in thel , a rperabove  example ,  but  w i th  nouns .
Our procedure  i s  ( i )  to  f indin  a g iven  text  th ree  types  of  SRW for  a smal l  g roup  o fnouns ,  (2) to  f ind  the  number o f  Sill; T shared  by each  pa i rof  nouns  fo rmed f rom the  group ,  and (3) to  express  the"s imi la r i ty"  between ind iv idua l  nouns)  and groups  of  nouns ,as a funct ion  o f  the i r  shared  SRI~.
Another  example :  i tmight  tu rn  out  that  in  a g iven  text  the  nouns  "a"  and "b"( "avocado"  and "cher ry" )  share  such  ad jec t ive  mod i f ie rs  as" r ipe , "  whereas  nouns "c )' and "d"  ( "cha i r "  and " fu rn i tu re" )have in  common the  ad jec t ive  mod i f ie r  "modern . "
Thesefac ts  would lead  us to  conc lude  that  "a"  and "b"  a re  s imi -la r ,  that  "c"  and "d"  a re  s imi la r )  that  "a"  and "c"  a reless  s imi la r ,  e tc .A number of  quest ions  a r i se :  What i s  "s imi la r i ty"anyway?
Do words that  a re  s imi la r  in  mean ing  rea l ly  sharea s ign i f i cant  number o f  SRW in  a g iven  text?
What i s  "as ign i f i cant  number"?
Do not  d i ss imi la r  words a l so  have  manycommon SRW?
flow much text  i s  necessary  in  o rder  to  es tab-l i sh  pat terns  o f  word behav ior?
What i s  the  e f fec t  o fmu l t ip le=mean ing  in  words ,  and of  us ing,  texts  f rom d i f fe r  =ent  sub jec t  a reas?

PROCIiDIIRI'\]Tile p resent  s tudy  was based on a ser ies  of  a r t i c lesfrom Russ ian  phys ics  journa ls ,  compr is ing  approx imate ly120)000 runn ing  words (some 500 pages) .
The process inp ,  ofth i s  te.xt has been descr ibed  e l sewhere ,  (1 '2 )  l te re ,  wenote  on ly  that  each sentence  of th i s  text  i s  recordedon magnet ic  tape ,  together  wi th  the fo l low ing  in fo rmat ionfo r  each occur rence  in  the  sentence :  i t s  par t  o f  speech ,i t s  "word number" (an ident i f i ca t ion  number in the machineg lossary} ,  and i t s  syntact i c  "governor"  or  "dependent"( i?

A re t r ieva l  program app l ied  toth i s  text  tape  then  y ie lded  in fo rmat ion  about  the SRI'i fo rwords in which we were in teres ted .
For  conven ience  andeconomy, a l l  words in the  machine pr in tout  fo r  th i s  s tudyare  ident i f ied  by word number, ra ther  than  in  the i r  "natura l -l anguage"  ?o rv).In our s tudy  we chose to dea l  wit\]~ the SRI~ of fo r tyRuss ian  nouns ,  here in  ca l led  Test  ~ords {TW).
The numberl ta rper  4is  complete ly  a rb i t ra ry ;  t i le par t i cu la r  nouns chosen  (seeTable 1) a'ere presumed to form d i f fe rent  semant ic  g roup ings .Table 1 g ives  one poss ib le  group ing  of  these  words;  thec r i te r ia  fo r  g roup ing  are more or less  obv ious ,  a l thoughthe reader  may eas i ly  form d i f fe rent  g roups ,  by expand ingor cont ract ing  the groups that  we have des ignated .
Theon ly  purpose  of  g roup ing  is  to prov ide  a weak measure ofcont ro l  in the  exper iment :  i f  two nouns are found to bes imi la r  in terms of  the i r  SRN, we shou ld  l i ke  to  compareth i s  f ind ing  w i th  some in tu i t i ve  unders tand ing  of the i rs imi la r i ty .
(For  conven ience ,  we sha l l  re fe r  to the  'rWsby the i r  Eng l i sh  equ iva lents .
)Two nouns may be compared wi th  re ference  to severa l  d i f -fe rent  types  of SRW.

Through automatic scanning of the text, eachoccurrence of tile 40 TWs was located, and in each instancethe identity (word number) of relevant SR~V was recorded.A listing is produced for each of the TWs (see Table 2,"SRW Detail," for an example of the TW, VYCISLENIE = calcu-lation 1), showing tile different words used as adjectivedependents (List i), noun dependents (List 2), and noungovernors (List 3).
Tile number of words on each of theselists is also shown in Table i, together with the totalnumber of SRW for each TW (List 4).
We stress the fact thatthese numbers refer to different words used as SRW; therepetition of a given SRW (for a given SRW type) was notrecorded.2.
Each Tl~ was automatically compared with every otherTW, with respect to their shared SRW, i.e., in terms ofthe words i~ Lists I, 2, and 3 of the "SRW Detail Listing.
"A new listing, "Similarity Ranking by T%~'," is then produced(see Table 3 for the T~, VYCISLENIE = calculationl).
Thislisting shows for each TW the number of shared SRW of eachof the three types (NI, N2, and N3, Table 3), the totalnumber of shared SR%~ (NA), and a measure of similarity forthe pairs, herein designated as the Similarity Coefficient(SC).
The SC is a decimal fraction obtained by dividingthe sum of shared SRW for each pair of TWs by the productof the frequencies of the two TWs.

The pairings for each TW are ordered onthe value of the SC.
It should be noted that the similaritybetween TWs is measured in terms of the total number ofshared SRW (Column NA of Table 3); it is also possible toexpress this measurement in terms of shared SRW of anysingle type.A third listing was also produced: a listing of the7,~I) TI~'-pairs, ordered oll the value of the SC.
This listing,not reproduced here because of its length, will be referredto as "Ranking of TW-Pairs by SC~."
'Fable 4 shows the dis-tribution of the SC as compared with tile number of TW pairs.The following discussion is based on the three list-ings described above.
A few additional remarks may bemade about the procedure itself, which may be likened todeep-sea fishing with a tea strainer full of holes.
Thelimitations of size are obvious: we have limited ourselvesto three of the numerous ways of comparing nouns in termsof their SRW.
Other types of SRW that suggest themselvesare :  verbsj where TW is subject; verbs, where TW is directobject; prepositional phrases as dependents, or governors,of TW; nouns joined to TW through coordinate conjunctions(i.e., "apples" and "grapes" are said to be more similar if"apples and oranges" and "grapes and oranges" occur intext).
Some of the holes in our tea strainer are: theneglect of the case of the noun dependent of TW, or the'Liarpor i0--- ' tq'.~.II.

In view of these  de f i c ienc ies  (notto ment ion  the prob lem of  s ta t i s t i cs ) ,  the  success  of  ourf i sh ing  exped i t ion  i s  open to doubt .
Let us then  proceedto examine the  catch .3.

We can scarce lyexamine and d iscuss  the  degrees  of s i r .~ i la r i ty  of 780 noun-pa i rs .
The prob lem of in terpretat ion  is  a l so  compl ica ted :how complete ly  and accurate ly  shou ld  the resu l t s  cor res -pond with our  expectat ions ,  as represented  in the  tentat ivesemant ic  g roup ings  (Table  1)?
Our approach i s  to dea l  ina summary manner with the  noun-pa i rs  character i zed  byhighest Similarity Coefficients, especially with respect totheir intra- and inter-group relationships.
Before proceedingto this discussion, a few preliminary remarks should bemade about the data in the various machine listings.The summary of SRW counts for each TW, contained inTable I, suggests all TWs do not have the same opportunityfor comparison.
In the case of "correspondence" (Group 3),t la rper  12a total of only three SRW is noted in (Column 14); as aresult, this TW should be eliminated from furtJler consider-ation.
In addition, unless at least two, and preferablyall three, types of SRW are well represented for a givenTW, the SC for that noun will tend to be skewed.
Asexamples ,  we note  a l l  nouns in Croup 6 ( fo r  which the 1,3column predominates ) ,  and the nouns in  Group lO ( fo r  whichthe  L2 column predominates ) .
In e f fec t ,  these  nouns are"de f i c ient"  in cer ta in  types  of  SRI;', and requ i re  spec ia lhand l ing ., t  On the pr in tout ,  "Rank ing of  T l~-Pairs  by SC, anumber of noun pa i rs  appear  at  the  top end of  the sca lea l though the  to ta l  number of shared  SRW is  smal l  ( i .e .

"The SC may be h igh ,  because  the product  of  the f requenc iesi s  re la t ive ly  low.
Our po l i cy  has been to  d i scount  thesepa i rs  on the  grounds that  the  va lue  of  "NA" i s  s ign i f i cantin  determin ing  the  s imi la r i ty  between two TWs.
The minimumva lue  fo r  NA was arb i t ra r i l y  se t  a t  four .Keeping in mind these  anmndat ions  to  the data  in  mind,We proceed to the d i scuss ion  of the  noun-pa i rs  character -i zed by h ighest  S(:.
Table  3 shows the  d i s t r ibut ion  o f5(2 by noun-pa i rs .
By any s tandard ,  the  data  shows nega-t i ve  or ext remely  weak s imi la r i ty  fo r  most of the 780 pa i rs .iAAn abst rac t  of  a paper  on ti le p roc l iv i ty  of  nouns toenter  in to  cer ta in  combinat ions  i s  c i ted  in Reference  3.~,arper 13At which point on the curve shall we draw a line, sayingthat an SC above this value indicates similarity, a~dthat an SC below this value indicates dissimilarity orweak similarity (all this of course: in terms of rcliability)?For purposes of discussion, we propose to set the t\]~resholdat .00100--a rigorously high figure.
After eliminatingpairs whose NA value is less than 4, we find 38 p,~irs whoseSC lies in the range .00100 to .01~337 (Table 5).
(Z\],e firsttwo zeroes are dropped.
)The reader may draw his own conclusions about thedegree of similarity between the nouns in any given pair-ing.
For purposes of discussion, we will refer to thepairings in terms of our preliminary groupings (Table I).The following intra- and inter-Group pairings are observedin Tab le 5 :Nouns of Group 1 pair with nouns of Group I, 22 I, 2, i034 55 4, 5, 6, 76 5, 6,7 5, 789 9i0 2, I0ii 5, IiWe note that no pairings appear for nouns of Groups 3and 8.
All other groups except Group 4 are represented byintra-group pairings; to this degree, our expectationsare fulfilled, i.e., the data supports our a priori feel-ings for the similarity between words.

This tendency is more markedif we lower the SC threshold from .00100 to .00070,thereby adding a total of 28 pairs to the number listed inTable 5.
For example, nouns of Group 1 are found to pairwith those of Group 10, and nouns of Group 4 pair withthose of Groups 6 and 7.The data is not statistically conclusive, but stronglysuggests the emergence of the two major groups mentionedabove.
The amalgamation of Groups 1 and 2 can easily bedefended on semantic grounds; since Group 10, as notedabove, is subject to aberrant behavior (because of the veryhigh number of noun dependents), its inter-relation withGroups 1 and 2 may not be taken seriously.
Groups 4, 5,6, and 7, which include the names of chemical mixtures,classes of elements, individual elements, and components ofelements, may be taken together semantically as a singlesub-class of "object nouns."
The physicist tends to say thesame things about all nouns in this group.One of tile 38 pairs listed in Table 5 appears to con-tradict expectation: "l iquid"/"problem"(Groups 5 and Ii).I t  shou ld  a l so  be noted  that  the  noun dependents  o fGroup i0 nouns serve a "subjective" rather than "objective"function.
If we had distinguished between the syntacticfunction of the noun dependent, TWs of Group I0 would be onlyweakly similar to TWs of Groups 1 and 2.l l a rper  16Tile four  SRW shared  by those  two nouns inc lude  the  ad jec t ive"cer ta in"  and the noun governor  "number . "
The non-d isc r im-inatory  ( "promiscuous" )  nature  of  these  two SRW is  perhapsobv ious ,  and one o f  the  re f ine laents  that  shou ld  be in t ro -duced in fu ture  s tud ies  is  the  neg lec t  o f  such words as"s ign i f i cant"  SRI~.
(Tile s tudy  of "promiscu i ty"  in ad jec -t i ves  is  re fe r red  to in Re ference  4. )
At the  present ,exper ience  suggests  that  d i s to r t ions  in t roduced  by suchwords a re  min imal  i f  the  number of  SRW is  su f f i c ient ly  la rge .Our genera l  conc lus ion  is  that ,  w i th  a few anomal ies ,the 66 pairings for which the SC Is .00700 or highermeet with our expcctations.Another aspect of the question remains: many nounswith presumed similarity arc not represented on the highend of the SC distribution curve.
(If we lower the thresh-old to include such pairs we shall also encounter manynon-similar pairs.)
One way of dealing with this problemis to consider the most highly correlated pairs that nounsin each Group form, whether or not the SC is "signifi-cantly" high.
In lieu of presenting this information infull detail, we show in Table 6 the most closely correlatedpairs for a representative noun from each of the Groups(excepting Groups 3, 4, and 8).The most striking aspect of Table 6 is the repetitionof intra- and inter-Group pairings noted in Table S forhigh-SC pairings.

lee have notyet attempted to apply clumping procedures; a betterunderstanding of the data is perhaps a prerequisite to thisrigorous treatment.
For the present, we shall point outa phenomenon that strongly suggests the existence ofclumps: the recurrence of the same SRI~ ~ among several TWswith high mutual correlation.

I t  would seem that  the" togetherness"  of  these  three  TWs is  s t rengthened by th i sfeature ,  which we term " recur rence  of  SR;V." We have noready fo rmula  fo r  determin ing  that  recur rence  is  or is  notsignificant in a given situation.
In general, the nature andbehavior of individual SRIV remain to be studied, so far astheir relevance to our problem is concerned.4.
CONCLUS IONSWe conclude that there is considerable agreementbetween the results of our experiment and an a priori feel-ing for the similarity of words.
Words that are similarin meaning tend to have the same SRI',' t to a far greaterdegree than chance would determine.
If this conclusion isvalid, a large-scale experiment is suggested, using alarger number of Test Words, more SRW types, and a largert la rper  2 0amount of  text .
