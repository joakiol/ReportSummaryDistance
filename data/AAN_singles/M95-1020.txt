STERLING SOFTWARE :AN NLTOOLSET-BASED SYSTEM FOR MUC-6Richard LeeSterling Software, ITD1650 Tysons Blvd, #800, McLean VA 22102Email: rlee@mclean.sterling .comINTRODUCTIONFor a little over two years, Sterling Software ITD has been developing the Automatic Templatin gSystem (ATS) [1] for automatically extracting entity and event data in the counter-narcotics domain frommilitary messages.
This system, part of the Counter Drug Intelligence System (CDIS), was built aroundthe NLToolset [2], which was originally developed by GE and is now being developed and supported b yLockheed-Martin .
Early results showed that the system was performing better than the human analyst sin all aspects .ATS was in its final delivery phase at the same time as our MUC-6 development .
We elected toparticipate despite this conflict, but it did limit us to 4 person-weeks on MUC-6, forcing us to scale bac kfrom our original plans and only participate in the NE and TE tasks .
The results were more thangratifying.SYSTEM DESIGNNE Postprocessing articlearticleartic, Lexica lAnalysistokersequence:ReductionI	 STEReductioTE postprocessing entitytemp ate sMerging ex ectST postprocessinc al l` temp atesFigure 1: System DesignOur MUC-6 system (Figure 1) consists of 5 major components, applied in sequence : Lexical Analysis,Reduction, Extraction, Merging, Postprocessing.
It was designed to share as much of the processin gsequence between tasks as possible .
The processing for NE followed the identical sequence of step s(Lexical Analysis, and Reduction) as was followed for the TE and ST tasks, then diverged to its ow nPostprocessing component to write the NE file .
The Reduction steps taken to identify portions of text formarking in NE also filled the slots with the appropriate text for the TE task.
The processing specific to STdiverged after all the phrase-level Reductions for NE and TE had been performed .TE expectations expectation sExtraction MergingtokerReduction ~ sequen1 	 Extraction IST expect249The heart of the system is a sophisticated pattern-matcher, which is used repeatedly in the course o fprocessing to identify text for Reduction or Extraction.
While the NLToolset alo provides a parser, afte rsome initial development we abandoned it on ATS, and did not use it on MUC-6 .Lexical AnalysisThe Lexical Analysis component has several subcomponents .
First, a tokenizer converts the inputstring for the entire article into a sequence of tokens .
We modified the NLToolset-supplied tokenizer totry to prevent it from reordering or dropping text in ways that made it difficult to map back to theoriginal text when writing the NE output file; we also modified it to preserve upper- vs lower-cas einformation.The second step in Lexical Analysis is the actual lexicon lookup, which attaches information from th elexicon to the tokens .
This includes morphological analysis, which was useful primarily for determinin gthe root form of nationalities, such as "Canadian" -> CANADA.
It also includes finding multi-tokenlexicon entries, such as "New York" and "Coca-Cola" .
Since we weren't using the parser, the part-of-speech obtained by a lexical lookup was of interest mainly if it was something like city-name or org-name; we did also try to prevent the inappropriate inclusion of verbs, prepositions, etc in names, wit hmixed results .The third step in Lexical Analysis is the insertion of special marker tokens to indicate capitalize dwords .
This was needed to be able to usethat information in name recognition, since there did not appea rto be any good way to get the pattern matcher to use the capitalization information contained in th eoriginal tokens .Finally, Lexical Analysis splits the token sequence into sentences, including one each for headline ,dateline, and date.ReductionThe Reduction components each consist of one or more stages of applying the NLToolset's patternmatcher to phrases .
Any phrase matched is "reduced", usually but not always to a single multi-token, o r"mtoken" .
In each stage, all the patterns appropriate to that stage are tried on each sentence in turn .The very first reduction stage is a "junk" reduction to delete tables so they are not seen by subsequentreduction stages.Each subsequent reduction has two useful side-effects : 1) identifying which tokens form the heart ofthe reduction and therefore should be marked for the NE task, and 2) filling the slots of the mtokens wit happropriate pieces of the text that was reduced, for the TE task .
Note that these two purposes oftenconflict -- for example, city, state references and date ranges were supposed to have pieces marke dseparately, but were reduced to single mtokens with one set of slot fillers .
This called for some carefu lengineering.The applications of reduction patterns are done in sequence rather than all at once for a number o freasons: First, some references to a person, organization, or location may not be recognizable b ythemselves, but other references to the same thing may be easier to spot .
Therefore, every new thingreduced is added to a temporary lexicon, and another reduction step is applied to look for othe rreferences (with certain allowed variations) to those same things ; for example, relatively easy-to-recognize references to "Mr. Jones" or "Robert L .
James" would enable later recognition of the moreproblematic "Barnaby Jones" and "James" .
And when adding to this lexicon, appropriate variations in a n(organization) name are included so that they would be recognized if they occured ; for example:250NamePossible variations"Paramount Pictures Corp .
""Paramount" "Paramount Pictures ""New York Post""Post""Kidder , Peabody & Co.""Kidder" "Kidder Peabody ""National Labor Relations Board""NLRB "When such a "secondary" organization reference is reduced, the text is put in the org_alias slot; the fullform is pulled from the lexicon and put in the org_name slot to ensure proper merging (see below) of thetwo referents .Second, the results of reductions can be used to provide additional context for later reductions; forexample, person reduction is done after organization, so a reduced organization can help the patter nmatcher recognize a person, as in the token sequence [ARTIE MCDONALD , *ORG* 'S PRESIDENT] ,where *ORG* is the mtoken produced by the earlier reduction .
A reduction can also involve multiplepreviously-reduced mtokens, filling the slots of one with information from another ; for example, thereduction of the token sequence [*ORG* , A *LOC* - BASED MANUFACTURER] includes filling th eorg_descriptor, org_locale, and org_country slots of *ORG* with the descriptive phrase and th einformation from *LOC* .ExtractionAn Extraction component uses the results of a pattern match to generate an "expectation" and fill itsslots with pieces of the text matched .
For ST, a typical expectation represents an event, with the person,organization, date, etc mtokens in the clause that was matched being used to fill its slots .
For TE, eachexpectation is a trivial one containing one person or organization .MergingThe NLToolset provides a merging tool, which merges expectations of the same type (person,organization, etc) as long as the fillers of their corresponding slots do not conflict; a conflict occurs if bothhave a filler, the fillers are different, and the slot is not allowed to have multiple fillers .
Obviously, theorg_alias and org_descriptor slots were allowed to have multiple fillers and org_name was not .During reduction, our system actually splits a person's name across slots called given_name ,family_name, and suffix_name, so that the expectations for, say, "Harry L .
James, Jr ."
and "Mr. James "would be merged.
It also carefully fills slots such as org_type and a few others added just for thispurpose so as to prevent improper merges; for example, it reduces the token sequence [THE *ORG *UNIT] to two *ORG* mtokens, one old and one new, with slots filled so that they could not merge wit heach other .Initially, we relied on this merging tool to bring together separated org names and descriptors, such as"NEC Corp .
.
.
.
the giant Japanese computer manufacturer".
We soon found, however, that even withcareful use of slot fillers to prevent descriptors for commercial organizations from merging with, say, th ename of a government organization or a library, too many merges were incorrect .
We therefore devised aseparate stack mechanism which keeps track of the org mtokens for each sentence; when an or gdescriptor is reduced in the final TE reduction stage, the stack is searched starting at the current sentence ,to find the closest suitable referent that precedes the descriptor, and to add the descriptor text to th emtoken for that referent.
This approach worked quite well.251PostprocessingFor the NE task, the postprocessing step consists of traversing the token sequences in parallel with theoriginal text, writing the original text and inserting markers as the reduction results attached to eac htoken indicated .
We had to go back to original text to include those portions of the article header whic hwere not processed, and to recover from cases where the tokenizer had dropped characters despite ourmodifications .For the TE task, the postprocessing step consists of traversing the list of expectations and writing atemplate for each, performing final clean-ups like removing duplicate aliases, combining theperson_name pieces, skipping slots used only to control merging, etc .KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERINGThe bulk of the time spent in knowledge engineering was spent developing the patterns for all th eReduction and Extraction stages .
These patterns were devised to take advantage of all the loca lcontextual clues we could come up with, including upper- vs lower-case information and descriptiveappositives .
Our results show that this approach works well ; and the modularity of the patterns makes i teasy to add coverage as we discover additional clues (such as those we discuss in the walkthrough withrespect to organizations) .The reliance on case information meant that headlines were a bit of a problem ; despite giving themsomewhat special treatment, our error rate was higher there than elsewhere:* * * DOCUMENT SECTION SCORES * * *SLOT POS ACT COR PAR INC SPU MIS NON REC PRE UND OVG ERR SU BI-IL 136 142 119 0 7 16 10 0 88 84 7 11 22 6DD 60 60 60 0 0 0 0 0 100 100 0 0 0 0DL 52 52 52 0 0 0 0 0 100 100 0 0 0 0TXT 2046 2024 1889 0 47 88 110 0 92 93 5 4 11 2There was some lexicon work, as well.
This included entries for all the countries, with alternat ephrases (such as "West Germany" for "Federal Republic of Germany") and irregular derivations (such a s"Dutch" for "Netherlands"), and entries for major cities and geographical regions, with their countr yinformation included .
For organizations, we limited it to a few dozen major ones that have no reliabl einternal clues and often occur without any contextual clues (such as "White House", "Fannie Mae", "Bi gBoard", "Coca-Cola" and "Coke", "Macy's", "Exxon", etc) .252WALKTHROUGHNE: 9402240133 key: 9402240133-1 response: 9402240133- 1SLOT POS ACT COR PAR INC SPU PRE SUBMISNON REC UND OVG ERR<enamex> 69 68 63 0 0 5 60 91 93 9 7 15 0type 69 68 53 0 10 5 60 77 78 9 7 28 16text 69 68 60 0 3 5 60 87 88 9 7 19 5<timex> 6 9 6 0 0 3 00 100 67 0 33 33 0type 6 9 6 0 0 3 00 100 67 0 33 33 0text 6 9 6 0 0 3 00 100 67 0 33 33 0<numex> 6 7 6 0 0 1 00 100 86 0 14 14 0type 6 7 6 0 0 1 00 100 86 0 14 14 0text 6 7 6 0 0 1 00 100 86 0 14 14 0TOTAL 162 168 137 0 13 18 120 84 82 7 11 24 9TE: 9402240133key: 9402240133 response : 9402240133SLOT POS ACT COR PAR INC MIS SPU NON REC PRE UND OVG ERR SUBorganization 10 9 8 0 1 1 0 0 80 89 10 0 20 11name 10 8 7 0 1 2 0 0 70 88 20 0 30 13alias 3 1 1 0 0 2 0 6 33 100 67 0 67 0descriptor 3 2 1 0 1 1 0 6 33 50 33 0 67 50type 10 8 8 0 0 2 0 0 80 100 20 0 20 0locale 2 1 1 0 0 1 0 7 50 100 50 0 50 0country 2 1 1 0 0 1 0 7 50 100 50 0 50 0person 6 10 6 0 0 0 4 0 100 60 0 40 40 0name 6 10 6 0 0 0 4 0 100 60 0 40 40 0alias 3 4 2 0 0 1 2 4 67 50 33 50 60 0title 2 3 2 0 0 0 1 4 100 67 0 33 33 0TOTAL 41 38 29 0 2 10 7 34 71 76 24 18 40 6Table 1 : Results on the walkthrough articl eThe results on the walkthrough article (see Table 1) compared to our overall results show that this wa sindeed a relatively difficult article.
They show three issues worth discussing.First, we had low precision on timex .
Two out of the three "spurious" dates are due to our apparentl ymistaken belief that "yesterday" and "tomorrow" were supposed to be marked .
This knowledgeengineering error led to the worst recall or precision number on our overall NE results, a precision o ntimex of 84; avoiding that error would have raised it to 94 .Second, recall and precision on organizations was a bit low .
The system missed both "FallonMcElligott" and "McCann-Erickson" .
On the former, a phrase like "ad agency Fallon McElligott" woul dhave caused it to be found, but the actual phrase "other ad agencies, such as Fallon McElligott" did not .On the latter, not having a pattern to cover things like "chief executive officer of McCann-Erickson" wa san omission on our part.25 3Other organization errors were : getting "New York Times", which in this article is incorrect ; missing thetwo descriptors for "Ammirati & Puris" and the locale for "Coca-Cola" .
The locale error points ou tanother major cause of poor results -- a next-to-last-minute change in the final TE pattern for picking u pcombination of organization name plus location and/or descriptor, inadequately tested, led t oinadvertantly dropping coverage of the most basic of combinations : [*ORG* $lprep *LOC*], where $lprepis a macro for: "one of ',' 'in"of".
This unfortunate error had the following effect on total locale slot scor eon TE :POS ACT COR REC PREactual110 5942387 1corrected 110 7659547 1Third, problems with persons .
The system decided "McCann" was a person, based on "the McCan nfamily"; since it did not recognize "McCann-Erickson" as a company, every reference to "McCann" wa stherefore marked as a person.
Due to inadequate restrictions on our use of capitalization, the system als odecided "While McCann" and "One McCann" were distinct persons .
It decided that "John J .
Dooner, Jr."and "John Dooner" were distinct persons ; the "Jr ."
would not have caused it to make that decision, but th e"J ."
did .Now, the walkthrough .

The only things worth noting here are the "yesterday" errors already discussed ,that the system decided "60 pounds" was a reference to money, and that the information in the lexica lentry for "Atlanta" was used to fill the slots of the *LOC* mtoken .The next Reduction stages take care of "primary" then "secondary" references to organizations .The primary stage picks up "Interpublic Group", "PaineWebber", "Coca-Cola", "Coke", "Creative Artist sAgency", 'WPP Group", "Ammirati & Puris", "New York Yacht Club" and "New York Times" .
It misses"Fallon McBride" and "McCann-Erickson" for reasons already noted .
The only reason it gets"PaineWebber", "Coca-Cola", and "Coke" is because they are in the lexicon ; the others are all picked up bymatch various patterns.In this article, the only secondary reference is "CAA" as a reference to "Creative Artists Agency" .
Whilethe system does manufacture acronyms as potential secondary references when certainpattems match ,the pattern which enabled it to determine that "Creative Artists Agency" was a commercial organizatio nwas unfortunately not one of them .255The next Reduction stages take care of "primary" then "secondary" references to persons .The primary stage picks up "James", "John Dooner", "Kevin Goldman", "Robert L .
James", "John J .Dooner, Jr .
", "Mr .
James", "Mr. Dooner", "Alan Gottesman", "Peter Kim", "Walter Thompson", "Marti nPuris", and (alas) "McCann" .
These are found on the strength of titles like "Mr ."
and "Sen.", known firstnames, and contextual clues such as known occupations like "president", "analyst", etc .
"James" in th eheadline is found because it follows "succeed"; "McCann" is found because of "McCann family" .The secondary stage picks up all remaining references to "McCann" .
Since "McCann-Erickson" was notrecognized as an organization, all those occurrences are picked up, too .
And since we failed to makeadverbs off-limits as new first names in this stage, it decides that "While McCann" and "One McCann"(note the capitalization) are distinct persons .<DOC><DOCID> wsj94_026.0231 </DOCID><DOCNO> 940224-0133.

For NE, the system uses the original text of the article to write acopy.
It traverses the token sequences in parallel with the original text, using the fact that each tokencontains information on all the reductions it was involved in to determine where to insert begin and en dbrackets .
It only pays attention to the final reduction except in the case of locations inside money, wher ebrackets are inserted for both.BeforePerson :Family_Name: "James"Per_Alias : "James"Person :Given_Name: "Robert L."Family_Name: "James"Person :Per_Title: "Mr."Family_Name: "James"Per_Alias : "James "Person:Given_Name: "While"Family_Name: "McCann"Person:Given_Name: "One"Family_Name: "McCann"Person:Family_Name: "McCann"Per_Alias : "McCann"Organization :Org_Name : "Coca-Cola"Org_Alias: "Coca-Cola "Known: "Yes "Organization:Org_Name : "Coca-Cola "Org_Alias: "Coke"Known: "Yes"Figure 5: MergingFor TE, there is one final Reduction stage to take care of organization descriptors and locations .
Here,the system finds descriptors "the big Hollywood talent agency" and "a hot agency", but not "a qualit yoperation" and "the agency with billings of $400 million" .
The former omission was deliberate, due to toomany spurious matches when it was included; the latter was a construct we did not think to include .

In either case, the descriptor and locale information (if any) is inserted into slots o fthe organization mtoken .
In retrospect, including indefinite references that are not appositives appears tohave been the wrong thing to do .Then there is the trivial Extraction step which turns the organization and person mtokens int o"expectations".
This is followed by the Merging step which merges expectations together whereverpossible.

These results show that our semantic-pattern-basedapproach to entity detection and templating is a very good one, and one which can be brought to bear o na new application quickly .As we have noted, dramatic improvements in the worst numbers (timex in NE, org locale and countryin TE) would have been obtained with very minor changes in the patterns -- literally, a couple hour sworth of work .
The org locale fix would actually have given us the highest f-measure on that category :61 .3.
Despite that "couple hours" estimate, we would have to say that our greatest limiting factor wa s260time -- time to test more thoroughly and isolate the causes of the biggest problems .
Slowness of thesystem was a problem but not a major one, as it took only a minute or two per article .After those two improvements, we turn to the problem of org descriptors -- although we had th ehighest f-measure, it was only 43.6, which shows that there is still room for improvement .
Here, thesolutions are less obvious .
One step to take is to add to the patterns to allow modifier phrases after thehead noun in a descriptor noun phrase, such as "the agency with billings of $400 million" .
Moreexploration is needed on this, especially in light of the fact that both the recall and precision rates werelow.Another area where we would like to make changes is in the order of reduction stages .
For example,the system currently does all person reductions after organization reductions .
This meant we had toprevent the secondary organization reduction from matching what are clearly person names (eg: primary"Schecter Group" -/-> secondary "Mr. Schecter") .
The solution, clearly, is to apply some of the perso npatterns before the organization patterns .Since all the processing occurs without any regard to the types of events discussed in the articles, thesystem we have developed here is easily portable across domains.
If a domain required a different set o ftemplate slots than used for MUC-6, the patterns would be unchanged but the reduction code that fill sthe slots, and the postprocessing code that reports them, would have to be modified slightly .We have demonstrated, on MUC-6 and on CDIS, that we have an excellent approach to both entity an devent extraction on a range of document types .
We hope to have the opportunity to continue this work ,as funding permits .REFERENCES[1]Osterholtz, L. and Lee, R .
