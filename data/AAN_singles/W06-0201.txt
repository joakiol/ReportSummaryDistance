To enable this,we used data sets provided by a workshopon multimodal summarization for trend in-formation (the MuST Workshop) to con-struct an automatic trend exploration sys-tem.
This system first extracts units, tem-porals, and item expressions from news-paper articles, then it extracts sets of ex-pressions as trend information, and finallyit arranges the sets and displays them ingraphs.
For example, when documentsconcerning the politics are given, the sys-tem extracts ?%?
and ?Cabinet approvalrating?
as a unit and an item expression in-cluding temporal expressions.
It next ex-tracts values related to ?%?.
Finally, itmakes a graph where temporal expressionsare used for the horizontal axis and thevalue of percentage is shown on the ver-tical axis.
This graph indicates the trendof Cabinet approval rating and is usefulfor investigating Cabinet approval rating.Graphs are obviously easy to recognizeand useful for understanding informationdescribed in documents.
In experiments,when we judged the extraction of a correctgraph as the top output to be correct, thesystem accuracy was 0.2500 in evaluationA and 0.3334 in evaluation B.
(In evalua-tion A, a graph where 75% or more of thepoints were correct was judged to be cor-rect; in evaluation B, a graph where 50%or more of the points were correct wasjudged to be correct.)
When we judgedthe extraction of a correct graph in the topfive outputs to be correct, accuracy rose to0.4167 in evaluation A and 0.6250 in eval-uation B.
Our system is convenient and ef-fective because it can output a graph thatincludes trend information at these levelsof accuracy when given only a set of doc-uments as input.1 IntroductionWe have studied ways to automatically extracttrend information from text documents, such asnewspaper articles, because such a capability willbe useful for exploring and examining trends.
Inthis work, we used data sets provided by a work-shop on multimodal summarization for trend in-formation (the MuST Workshop) to construct anautomatic trend exploration system.
This systemfirsts extract units, temporals, and item expres-sions from newspaper articles, then it extract setsof expressions as trend information, and finally itarranges the sets and displays them in graphs.
Forexample, when documents concerning the politics1are given, the system extracts ?%?
and ?Cabinetapproval rating?
as a unit and an item expressionincluding temporal expressions.
It next extractsvalues related to ?%?.
Finally, it makes a graphwhere temporal expressions are used for the hor-izontal axis and the value of percentage is shownon the vertical axis.
This graph indicates the trendof Cabinet approval rating and is useful for inves-tigating Cabinet approval rating.
Graphs are obvi-ously easy to recognize and useful for understand-ing information described in documents.2 The MuST WorkshopKato et al organized the workshop on multimodalsummarization for trend information (the MuSTWorkshop) (Kato et al, 2005).
In this work-shop, participants were given data sets consistingof newspaper documents (editions of the Mainichinewspaper from 1998 and 1999 (Japanese docu-ments)) that included trend information for vari-ous domains.
In the data, tags for important ex-pressions (e.g.
temporals, numerical expressions,and item expressions) were tagged manually.1 The20 topics of the data sets (e.g., the 1998 home-runrace to break the all-time Major League record,the approval rating for the Japanese Cabinet, andnews on typhoons) were provided.
Trend infor-mation was defined as information regarding thechange in a value for a certain item.
A change inthe number of home runs hit by a certain player ora change in the approval rating for the Cabinet areexamples of trend information.
In the workshop,participants could freely use the data sets for anystudy they chose to do.3 System3.1 Structure of the systemOur automatic trend exploration system consistsof the following components.1.
Component to extract important expressionsFirst, documents related to a certain topic aregiven to the system, which then extracts im-portant expressions that will be used to ex-tract and merge trend information.
The sys-tem extracts item units, temporal units, anditem expressions as important expressions.1We do not use manually provided tags for important ex-pressions because our system automatically extracts impor-tant expressions.Here, important expressions are defined asexpressions that play important roles in agiven document set.
Item expressions are de-fined as expressions that are strongly relatedto the content of a given document set.1a.
Component to extract important itemunitsThe system extracts item units that willbe used to extract and merge trend infor-mation.For example, when documents concern-ing the home-run race are given, ?hon?or ?gou?
(the Japanese item units for thenumber of home runs) such as in ?54hon?
(54th home run) are extracted.1b.
Component to extract important tempo-ral unitsThe system extracts temporal units thatwill also be used to extract and mergetrend information.For example, the system extracts tempo-ral units such as ?nichi?
(day), ?gatsu?
(month), and ?nen?
(year).
In Japanese,temporal units are used to express dates,such as in ?2006 nen, 3 gatsu, 27 nichi?for March 27th, 2006.1c.
Component to extract important itemexpressionsThe system extracts item expressionsthat will also be used to extract andmerge trend information.For example, the system extracts expres-sions that are objects for trend explo-ration, such as ?McGwire?
and ?Sosa?as item expressions in the case of docu-ments concerning the home-run race.2.
Component to extract trend information setsThe system identifies the locations in sen-tences where a temporal unit, an item unit,and an item expression that was extracted bythe component to extract important expres-sions appear in similar sentences and extractssets of important expressions described bythe sentences as a trend information set.
Thesystem also extracts numerical values appear-ing with item units or temporal units, anduses the connection of the numerical valuesand the item units or temporal units as nu-merical expressions or temporal expressions.2For example, in the case of documents con-cerning the home-run race, the system ex-tracts a set consisting of ?item expression:McGwire?, ?temporal expression: 11 day?
(the 11th), and ?numerical expression: 47gou?
(47th home run) as a trend informationset.3.
Component to extract and display importanttrend information setsThe system gathers the extracted trend infor-mation sets and displays them as graphs or byhighlighting text displays.For example, for documents concerningthe home-run race, the system displays asgraphs the extracted trend information setsfor ?McGwire?
.
In these graphs, temporalexpressions are used for the horizontal axisand the number of home runs is shown on thevertical axis.3.2 Component to extract importantexpressionsThe system extracts important expressions thatwill be used to extract trend information sets.
Im-portant expressions belong to one of the followingcategories.?
item units?
temporal units?
item expressionsWe use ChaSen (Matsumoto et al, 1999), aJapanese morphological analyzer, to extract ex-pressions.
Specifically, we use the parts ofspeeches in the ChaSen outputs to extract the ex-pressions.The system extracts item units, temporal units,and item expressions by using manually con-structed rules using the parts of speeches.
Thesystem extracts a sequence of nouns adjacent tonumerical values as item units.
It then extractsexpressions from among the item units which in-clude an expression regarding time or date (e.g.,?year?, ?month?, ?day?, ?hour?, or ?second?)
astemporal units.
The system extracts a sequence ofnouns as item expressions.The system next extracts important item units,temporal units, and item expressions that play im-portant roles in the target documents.The following three methods can be used to ex-tract important expressions.
The system uses oneof them.
The system judges that an expressionproducing a high value from the following equa-tions is an important expression.?
Equation for the TF numerical term in Okapi(Robertson et al, 1994)Score =?i?DocsTFiTFi+li?(1)?
Use of total word frequencyScore =?i?DocsTFi(2)?
Use of total frequency of documents where aword appearsScore =?i?Docs1 (3)In these equations, i is the ID (identificationnumber) of a document, Docs is a set of documentIDs, TFiis the occurrence number of an expres-sion in document i, l is the length of document i,and ?
is the average length of documents inDocs.To extract item expressions, we also applied amethod that uses the product of the occurrencenumber of an expression in document i and thelength of the expression as TFi, so that we couldextract longer expressions.3.3 Component to extract trend informationsetsThe system identifies the locations in sentenceswhere a temporal unit, an item unit, and an itemexpression extracted by the component to extractimportant expressions appears in similar sentencesand extracts sets of important expressions de-scribed by the sentences as a trend informationset.
When more than one trend information setappears in a document, the system extracts the onethat appears first.
This is because important andnew things are often described in the beginning ofa document in the case of newspaper articles.3.4 Component to extract and displayimportant trend information setsThe system gathers the extracted trend informa-tion sets and displays them in graphs or as high-lighted text.
In the graphs, temporal expressions3are used for the horizontal axis and numerical ex-pressions are used for the vertical axis.
The systemalso displays sentences used to extract trend infor-mation sets and highlights important expressionsin the sentences.The system extracts multiple item units, tempo-ral units, and item expressions (through the com-ponent to extract important expressions) and usesthese to make all possible combinations of thethree kinds of expression.
The system extractstrend information sets for each combination andcalculates the value of one of the following equa-tions for each combination.
The system judgesthat the combination producing a higher value rep-resents more useful trend information.
The fol-lowing four equations can be used for this purpose,and the system uses one of them.?
Method 1 ?
Use both the frequency of trendinformation sets and the scores of importantexpressionsM = Freq ?

S2?
S3(4)?
Method 2 ?
Use both the frequency of trendinformation sets and the scores of importantexpressionsM = Freq ?
(S1?
S2?
S3)13 (5)?
Method 3 ?
Use the frequency of trend in-formation setsM = Freq (6)?
Method 4 ?
Use the scores of important ex-pressionsM = S1?
S2?
S3(7)In these equations, Freq is the number of trendinformation sets extracted as described in Section3.3, and S1, S2, and S3 are the values of Score ascalculated by the corresponding equation in Sec-tion 3.2.The system extracts the top five item units, thetop five item expressions, and the top three tem-poral units through the component to extract im-portant expressions and forms all possible combi-nations of these (75 combinations).
The systemthen calculates the value of the above equations forthese 75 combinations and judges that a combina-tion having a larger value represents more usefultrend information.4 Experiments and DiscussionWe describe some examples of the output of oursystem in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, and the re-sults from our system evaluation in Section 4.4.We made experiments using Japanese newspaperarticles.4.1 Extracting important expressionsTo extract important expressions we applied theequation for the TF numerical term in Okapi andthe method using the product of the occurrencenumber for an expression and the length of theexpression as TFifor item expressions.
We didexperiments using the three document sets for ty-phoons, the Major Leagues, and political trends.The results are shown in Table 1.We found that appropriate important expres-sions were extracted for each domain.
For ex-ample, in the data set for typhoons, ?typhoon?was extracted as an important item expression andan item unit ?gou?
(No.
), indicating the ID num-ber of each typhoon, was extracted as an im-portant item unit.
In the data set for the MajorLeagues, the MuST data included documents de-scribing the home-run race between Mark McG-wire and Sammy Sosa in 1998.
?McGwire?
and?Sosa?
were properly extracted among the higherranks.
?gou?
(No.)
and ?hon?
(home run(s)), im-portant item units for the home-run race, wereproperly extracted.
In the data set for politicaltrends, ?naikaku shiji ritsu?
(cabinet approval rat-ing) was properly extracted as an item expressionand ?%?
was extracted as an item unit.4.2 Graphs representing trend informationWe next tested how well our system graphed thetrend information obtained from the MuST datasets.
We used the same three document sets as inthe previous section.
As important expressions inthe experiments, we used the item unit, the tempo-ral unit, and the item expression with the highestscores (the top ranked ones) which were extractedby the component to extract important expressionsusing the method described in the previous sec-tion.
The system made the graphs using the com-ponent to extract trend information sets and thecomponent to extract and display important trendinformation sets.
The graphs thus produced areshown in Figs.
1, 2, and 3.
(We used Excel to drawthese graphs.)
Here, we made a temporal axis foreach temporal expression.
However, we can also4Table 1: Examples of extracting important expressionsTyphoonitem units temporal units item expressionsgou nichi taihuu(No.)

), nichi (day),and taihuu (typhoon) were respectively extractedas the top ranked item unit, temporal unit, anditem expression.
The system extracted trend in-formation sets using these, and then made a graphwhere the temporal expression (day) was used forthe horizontal axis and the ID numbers of the ty-phoons were shown on the vertical axis.
TheMuST data included data for September and Octo-ber of 1998 and 1999.
Figure 1 is useful for seeingwhen each typhoon hit Japan during the typhoonseason each year.
Comparing the 1998 data withthat of 1999 reveals that the number of typhoonsincreased in 1999.For the Major Leagues data set, gou (No.
), nichi(day), and Maguwaia (McGwire) were extractedwith the top rank.
The system used these to makea graph where the temporal expression (day) wasused for the horizontal axis and the cumulativenumber of home runs hit by McGwire was shownon the vertical axis (Fig.
2).
The MuST dataincluded data beginning in August, 1998.
Thegraph shows some points where the cumulativenumber of home runs decreased (e.g., SeptemberFigure 3: Trend graph for the political trends dataset4th), which was obviously incorrect.
This was be-cause our system wrongly extracted the number ofhome runs hit by Sosa when this was given closeto McGwire?s total.In the political trends data set, %, gatsu(month), and naikaku shiji ritsu (cabinet approvalrating) were extracted with the top rankings.
Thesystem used these to make a graph where thetemporal expression (month) was used for thehorizontal axis and the Cabinet approval rating(Japanese Cabinet) was shown as a percentage onthe vertical axis.
The MuST data covered 1998and 1999.
Figure 2 shows the cabinet approvalrating of the Obuchi Cabinet.
We found that theoverall approval rating trend was upwards.
Again,there were some errors in the extracted trend infor-mation sets.
For example, although June was han-dled correctly, the system wrongly extracted Mayas a temporal expression from the sentence ?incomparison to the previous investigation in May?.4.3 Sentence extraction and highlightingdisplayWe then tested the sentence extraction and high-lighting display with respect to trend informationusing the MuST data set; in this case, we usedthe typhoon data set.
As important expressions,we used the item unit, the temporal unit, and theitem expression extracted with the highest scores(the top ranked ones) by the component to extractimportant expressions using the method describedin the previous section.
Gou (No.
), nichi (day),and taihuu (typhoon) were respectively extractedas an item unit, a temporal unit, and an item ex-pression.
The system extracted sentences includ-ing the three expressions and highlighted these ex-pressions in the sentences.
The results are shownin Figure 4.

(In the actual system, color isused to make this distinction.)
The extracted tem-poral expressions and numerical expressions arepresented in the upper part of the extracted sen-tence.
The graphs shown in the previous sectionwere made by using these temporal expressionsand numerical expressions.The extracted sentences plainly described thestate of affairs regarding the typhoons and wereimportant sentences.
For the research being doneon summarization techniques, this can be consid-ered a useful means of extracting important sen-tences.
The extracted sentences typically describethe places affected by each typhoon and whetherthere was any damage.
They contain importantdescriptions about each typhoon.
This confirmedthat a simple method of extracting sentences con-taining an item unit, a temporal unit, and an itemexpression can be used to extract important sen-tences.The fourth sentence in the figure includes infor-mation on both typhoon no.7 and typhoon no.8.We can see that there is a trend information setother than the extracted trend information set (un-derlined twice) from the expressions that are un-derlined once.
Since the system sometimes ex-tracts incorrect trend information sets, the high-lighting is useful for identifying such sets.4.4 EvaluationWe used a closed data set and an open data setto evaluate our system.
The closed data set wasthe data set provided by the MuST workshop or-ganizer and contained 20 domain document sets.The data sets were separated for each domain.We made the open data set based on the MuSTdata set using newspaper articles (editions of theMainichi newspaper from 2000 and 2001).
Wemade 24 document sets using information retrievalby term query.
We used documents retrieved byterm query as the document set of the domain foreach query term.We used the closed data set to adjust our systemand used the open data set to calculate the evalua-tion scores of our system for evaluation.We judged whether a document set included theinformation needed to make trend graphs by con-sulting the top 30 combinations of three kinds ofimportant expression having the 30 highest valuesas in the method of Section 3.4.
There were 19documents including such information in the opendata.
We used these 19 documents for the follow-ing evaluation.In the evaluation, we examined how accuratelytrend graphs could be output when using the topranked expressions.
The results are shown in Table2.
The best scores are described using bold fontsfor each evaluation score.We used five evaluation scores.
MRR is the av-erage of the score where 1/r is given as the scorewhen the rank of the first correct output is r (Mu-rata et al, 2005b).
TP1 is the average of the pre-cision in the first output.
TP5 is the average ofthe precision where the system includes a correctoutput in the first five outputs.
RP is the averageof the r-precision and AP is the average of the av-erage precision.
(Here, the average means that theevaluation score is calculated for each domain dataset and the summation of these scores divided bythe number of the domain data sets is the average.
)R-precision is the precision of the r outputs wherer is the number of correct answers.
Average pre-cision is the average of the precision when eachcorrect answer is output (Murata et al, 2000).
Ther-precision indicates the precision where the recalland the precision have the same value.
The preci-sion is the ratio of correct answers in the systemoutput.
The recall is the ratio of correct answersin the system output to the total number of correctanswers.Methods 1 to 4 in Table 2 are the methods usedto extract useful trend information described inSection 3.4.
Use of the expression length meansthe product of the occurrence number for an ex-pression and the length of the expression was usedto calculate the score for an important item ex-pression.
No use of the expression length meansthis product was not used and only the occurrencenumber was used.To calculate the r-precision and average preci-sion, we needed correct answer sets.
We made thecorrect answer sets by manually examining the top30 outputs for the 24 (= 4?
6) methods (the com-binations of methods 1 to 4 and the use of Equa-tions 1 to 3 with or without the expression length)and defining the useful trend information amongthem as the correct answer sets.In evaluation A, a graph where 75% or more ofthe points were correct was judged to be correct.In evaluation B, a graph where 50% or more of thepoints were correct was judged to be correct.8Table 2: Experimental results for the open dataEvaluation A Evaluation BMRR TP1 TP5 RP AP MRR TP1 TP5 RP APUse of Equation 1 and the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3855 0.3158 0.4737 0.1360 0.1162 0.5522 0.4211 0.7368 0.1968 0.1565Method 2 0.3847 0.3158 0.4211 0.1360 0.1150 0.5343 0.4211 0.6316 0.1880 0.1559Method 3 0.3557 0.2632 0.4211 0.1360 0.1131 0.5053 0.3684 0.6316 0.1805 0.1541Method 4 0.3189 0.2632 0.4211 0.1125 0.0973 0.4492 0.3158 0.6316 0.1645 0.1247Use of Equation 2 and the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3904 0.3158 0.4737 0.1422 0.1154 0.5746 0.4211 0.7368 0.2127 0.1674Method 2 0.3877 0.3158 0.4737 0.1422 0.1196 0.5544 0.4211 0.7368 0.2127 0.1723Method 3 0.3895 0.3158 0.5263 0.1422 0.1202 0.5491 0.4211 0.7895 0.2127 0.1705Method 4 0.2216 0.1053 0.3684 0.0846 0.0738 0.3765 0.2105 0.5789 0.1328 0.1043Use of Equation 3 and the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3855 0.3158 0.4737 0.1335 0.1155 0.5452 0.4211 0.7368 0.1943 0.1577Method 2 0.3847 0.3158 0.4211 0.1335 0.1141 0.5256 0.4211 0.6316 0.1855 0.1555Method 3 0.3570 0.2632 0.4737 0.1335 0.1124 0.4979 0.3684 0.6842 0.1780 0.1524Method 4 0.3173 0.2632 0.4737 0.1256 0.0962 0.4652 0.3684 0.6316 0.1777 0.1293Use of Equation 1 and no use of the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3789 0.3158 0.4737 0.1294 0.1152 0.5456 0.4211 0.7368 0.2002 0.1627Method 2 0.3750 0.3158 0.4211 0.1294 0.1137 0.5215 0.4211 0.6842 0.2002 0.1621Method 3 0.3333 0.2632 0.4211 0.1119 0.1072 0.4798 0.3684 0.6842 0.1763 0.1552Method 4 0.2588 0.1053 0.4737 0.1269 0.0872 0.3882 0.1579 0.6842 0.1833 0.1189Use of Equation 2 and no use of the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3277 0.2105 0.4737 0.1134 0.0952 0.4900 0.2632 0.7895 0.1779 0.1410Method 2 0.3662 0.2632 0.4737 0.1187 0.1104 0.5417 0.3684 0.7368 0.1831 0.1594Method 3 0.3504 0.2632 0.4737 0.1187 0.1116 0.5167 0.3684 0.7368 0.1884 0.1647Method 4 0.1877 0.0526 0.3684 0.0775 0.0510 0.3131 0.1053 0.5263 0.1300 0.0879Use of Equation 3 and no use of the expression lengthMethod 1 0.3855 0.3158 0.4737 0.1335 0.1155 0.5452 0.4211 0.7368 0.1943 0.1577Method 2 0.3847 0.3158 0.4211 0.1335 0.1141 0.5256 0.4211 0.6316 0.1855 0.1555Method 3 0.3570 0.2632 0.4737 0.1335 0.1124 0.4979 0.3684 0.6842 0.1780 0.1524Method 4 0.3173 0.2632 0.4737 0.1256 0.0962 0.4652 0.3684 0.6316 0.1777 0.12939From the experimental results, we found thatthe method using the total frequency for a word(Equation 2) and the length of an expression wasbest for calculating the scores of important expres-sions.Using the length of an expression was impor-tant.
(The way of using the length of an expres-sion was described in the last part of Section 3.2.
)For example, when ?Cabinet approval rating?
ap-pears in documents, a method without expressionlengths extracts ?rating?.
When the system ex-tracts trend information sets using ?rating?, it ex-tracts wrong information related to types of ?rat-ing?
other than ?Cabinet approval rating?.
Thishinders the extraction of coherent trend informa-tion.
Thus, it is beneficial to use the length of anexpression when extracting important item expres-sions.We also found that method 1 (using both the fre-quency of the trend information sets and the scoresof important expressions) was generally the best.When we judged the extraction of a correctgraph as the top output in the experiments to becorrect, our best system accuracy was 0.3158 inevaluation A and 0.4211 in evaluation B.When wejudged the extraction of a correct graph in the topfive outputs to be correct, the best accuracy rose to0.5263 in evaluation A and 0.7895 in evaluation B.In terms of the evaluation scores for the 24 originaldata sets (these evaluation scores were multipliedby 19/24), when we judged the extraction of a cor-rect graph as the top output in the experiments tobe correct, our best system accuracy was 0.3158 inevaluation A and 0.4211 in evaluation B.When wejudged the extraction of a correct graph in the topfive outputs to be correct, the best accuracy rose to0.5263 in evaluation A and 0.7895 in evaluation B.Our system is convenient and effective because itcan output a graph that includes trend informationat these levels of accuracy when given only a setof documents as input.As shown in Table 2, the best values for RP(which indicates the precision where the recall andthe precision have the same value) and AP were0.2127 and 0.1705, respectively, in evaluation B.This RP value indicates that our system couldextract about one out of five graphs among the cor-rect answers when the recall and the precision hadthe same value.5 Related studiesFujihata et al (Fujihata et al, 2001) developed asystem to extract numerical expressions and theirrelated item expressions by using syntactic infor-mation and patterns.
However, they did not dealwith the extraction of important expressions orgather trend information sets.
In addition, they didnot make a graph from the extracted expressions.Nanba et al (Nanba et al, 2005) took anapproach of judging whether the sentence rela-tionship indicates transition (trend information)or renovation (revision of information) and usedthe judgment results to extract trend information.They also constructed a system to extract nu-merical information from input numerical unitsand make a graph that includes trend information.However, they did not consider ways to extractitem numerical units and item expressions auto-matically.In contrast to these systems, our system auto-matically extracts item numerical units and itemexpressions that each play an important role in agiven document set.
When a document set fora certain domain is given, our system automati-cally extracts item numerical units and item ex-pressions, then extracts numerical expressions re-lated to these, and finally makes a graph basedon the extracted numerical expressions.
When adocument set is given, the system automaticallymakes a graph that includes trend information.Our system also uses an original method of pro-ducing more than one graphs and selecting an ap-propriate graph among them using Methods 1 to 4,which Fujihata et al and Namba et al did not use.6 ConclusionWe have studied the automatic extraction of trendinformation from text documents such as newspa-per articles.
Such extraction will be useful for ex-ploring and examining trends.
We used data setsprovided by a workshop on multimodal summa-rization for trend information (the MuST Work-shop) to construct our automatic trend explorationsystem.
This system first extracts units, tempo-rals, and item expressions from newspaper arti-cles, then it extracts sets of expressions as trendinformation, and finally it arranges the sets anddisplays them in graphs.In our experiments, when we judged the extrac-tion of a correct graph as the top output to be cor-rect, the system accuracy was 0.2500 in evaluation10A and 0.3334 in evaluation B.
(In evaluation A, agraph where 75% or more of the points were cor-rect was judged to be correct; in evaluation B, agraph where 50% or more of the points were cor-rect was judged to be correct.)
When we judgedthe extraction of a correct graph in the top five out-puts to be correct, we obtained accuracy of 0.4167in evaluation A and 0.6250 in evaluation B. Oursystem is convenient and effective because it canoutput a graph that includes trend information atthese levels of accuracy when only a set of docu-ments is provided as input.In the future, we plan to continue this line ofstudy and improve our system.
We also hope toapply the method of using term frequency in doc-uments to extract trend information as reported byMurata et al (Murata et al, 2005a).ReferencesKatsuyuki Fujihata, Masahiro Shiga, and TatsunoriMori.
