Part  of the answer lies i n  the profound role of fashion in ArtificialIntel l igence i n  its present pre-scientific phase.
A cyni ta l  American pro-fessor remarked recently that Artificial ~ntelligencd (AX) had an affair w i t hsomeonels work every year or two, and that,  just as there were no reasons forgalling i n  love, so ,  l a t e r ,  there were no reasons for f a l l i n g  out  again.

If what follows seems unduly philosophical, it shouldbe remetsabered that  Uttle - is agreed, and almost no achievements are beyondquestion.
To pretend otherwise, by concentrating only tm the d e t a i b o festablished programs, ~ u l d  be meretricious and misleading.To euntey an enewetic field like thie one is inevitably to laavo agreat deal of excel lent  work unextiminad, a t  least if one i a  going to domore than give a paragraph to each research project.
I have left out ofcotasideration at least seven groups of projects:(1) Early work in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Languagethat has been sumeyed by Wfnograd (1973) and Simmons (1970a)among others.
(2) Work by graduate students of, or intellectually dependent upsnthat of,  people discussed in same detail  here.
( 3 )  Wxk that derives essentially from projects described i n  detailhere.
This embraces several groups interested i n  testingpsychological hypotheses, as re11  as others constructing large-scale systems for speech recognition.
I have devoted no spaceto speech recognition as such here, for it seems to me to dependupon the quality of semantic and inferential understanding asmuch as anything, and so I have concentrated upon this morefundamental task.
(4) Work on language generators, as opposed to analysers and under-standers.
They are essential for obtaining any testable output,but are thearetically secondary.

Winograd's Understanding SystemWinograd's systea runs as  a dialogue, i n  r e a l  time, between a humanoperator who types i n  m e S q e s ,  and t h e  system proper, called SHRDLU, whichdisplays on a screen pictures of a closed world of coloured blocks andp y r a i d a ,  a b o x  in- which they can be put, and an arm or crane khat canmove che objects about.
SHRDLU displays its replies to the operator bywriting on the samq screen.
The fo l lowing  is a discontinuous sample ofthe dialogue Winograd giws in his book.

Firstly "pick-up", u n l i k e  "red", isPLACEPROPERTY -- -:defined in terms of other concepts i n  the system: i n  particular, i n  terms ofGR?SP and RAISEHAND, which axe two of the three basic actiQns in the system.Secondly, there are two r r p e s  of verb definition, semant ic  and inferentialWinograd does not give the semantic definition for "pick-up", but here isthe  one for  "grasp" which is a closelb- related verb.

More of the real content of such actionsis found in their inferential definition.
Here is the one fox '"pick-up":(CONSE TC - PICKUPI X )(PJCKUP xr( r n ( W S P  ?X)  T i i E o r n )(C.XXAL (RAISEHAND THEOREMS)TSlis definition allows the program to actually carry out the "pick-up"caamand if it is possible to do so in the simulated world, as it would notbe, for example, if -re were already a block dn top of the red one..PICKUP is being def i led in edzrms of a number of more p r i m i t i v e  s&-actions,such as GRASP and RAISEHAND each of which must be carried out in order thatsameming may indeed be p i c k e d  up.
There s u b - a c t i o ~  themselves have in-fesential  definitions: the one given for GRASP, for example, i s  somewhatdifferant from i t s  "C1(&EANS1' definition g i v e n  above, although the inferentialiPefini,tiona are aim, i n  sane se-e, definitions of meaning as wall as pro-gra~as  for actually carrying out the associated conmands.One reason for the enormous impdct of this work was that, prior to itsappearance, A1 work was not very l i n g u i s t i c a l l y  interesting, while theeystems of tho linguists had no place far the use of inference and realworld knowledge.
Thus a very limited union between the two  techniqueswas able to breed considerable results.
Before Winograd &ere were fewpmgrams i n  A 1  that could take a reasonable complex English s e n t a c e  andascribe any structure whatever to it.
In early classics of 'ngtura llanguage understanding' in AX, such as Bobrow's STUDENT (1968) problemsolver for simple algebra,  input sentences had to be short and of stereo-typed form, such as "what is the sum of ....

"Conversely, in linguistics, there was, unti l  very recently, l i t t l especulation on how we understand the reference of.
pronouns in such eleqent-ary sentences as "The s o l d i e r s  fired at the woslen.and I saw several f a l l " ,where it is c l e a r  that the answer is both definite, and that fhding i trequires some inferential manipulation of genaralirrtiens dwut  the world.3ha reader should ask himself at this j m i n t  h o w  he kwwe the nsrxact-refemnt of the pmnaun in that sentanca.3.

Of course, Ninograd 4s free to  concentrateon any micro-world he wishes, and all I am drawing attention to  here is thddanger of assuming that natural language is nomaiky about real world pro-cedures and, worse st i l l ,  the implicit making bf the assumption that we can-not understand discourse about a procedure unless we can do it ourselves.
Iaa not saying that Winograd i s  making this evidently false assumption, onlythat the rhetoric surrounding the application 05  the !meanings are procedures1sloglsln tx~ h i s  system m y  cause the  unwary t o  do so.There is quite a different and low-level problem about the equivalenceof Woods' and Winograd's systems, i f  w e  consider what we might call thereceived co-n-sense view of their  work, Consider the following threeassertions:(1) s system is an implementation of a transformational grammar(2) Winograd's work has shown the irrelevance of transformationalgrammar for language analysis - a'view widely held by reviewersof his work.
* a view modified in Hayes (1975) where it now seems that programs/pro-cdures  would serve as a 'semantics' instead (a quite different, andmore reasonable, position, of course).
(3) Woods' and Winograd's systems are formally equivalent - a viewheld by both of them.There is clearly swathing of an inconsistent triad anronyst thosrthree widely held breliaFs.

Scwe More General Uckgraund IasurfLWinograd's hvrk is a central rrxcmplr?
of the 'Artificial fn l~ l l i gr?nc*cparadigm of h.ngu&ge', using '~aradicp'  in Kuhn's (10701 sense of a 1arqescale revision in systematic thinking, where the,pa.radigru r e v i s e  is ,the'generati- paradigm1 of the  Chmskyan linguists fChomsky 1 9 5 7 ) .
F r athe A 1  pintof view, the generative linguistic tmrk of the last fifteenyears has three principal defects.
Firstly, the generation of sentences,with whatever attached structures, is not in anv interesting sense a dem-onstration of human understanding, nor is the separation of khe well-formedfrom the ill-fomed, by such methods- for understanding requires, at thevery least, b t h  the generation & sentences as parts of coherent discourseand some attampt to interpret, rather than qer5ly zeject, what seen to beill-farmed utterances.
Neither the transformational grammarians followingChomsky, nor their successors the generative semanticists (Lak-off  1971),have ever-eSplicitAy rknounced thd generative paradigm.Secondly, Chmsky's  distinction between pexfomance and competencemodels, and his advocacy of the latter, have isolated modern generativelinguistics from any effecti- - test of the systems of ruhes it proposes.Whether or not me distinction was intended to hdve this  effect, it hasmeant that a y  test sxtuation necessarily involves performance, which iswnaLdered vutsfde the province of serious linguistic stugy.
And anyembdiment of a svstein of rules in a computer, and assessment of its output, would be perf~rmance.
AI, too, is much concerned with the structureof linguistic processes, independent of any particular implementation,**** Vide: "Artificial Intellige~ce is the s.tudy of intellectual mechanismsapart from applications and apart f r a  how such mechanisms are realisedin the human or in animals. ''
(McCarthy 1974)but implementation i s  never excluded, as it is from competence models, butrather encouraged.Thirdly, as f mentioned before, there was 'mtil recently rio place inthe generative paradigm for inferences from fac ts  and inductive generalis-atlona, even though vex;y simple examples demonstrate the need for it.This l a s t  point, a b ~ u t  the shortcomings of conventional linguisticsis not  at all new, and i n  A 1  is at least  as old as Minsky's (1968,p.22)obawvat ion that in 'He put the box on the table.
Because it wasn' t  level,it s l i d  o f f ' ,  the l a s t  ' itt can only be referred correctly to the box,rqther than the t&le, on the basis of some knowledge quite oth#r thanthat i n  a conventional, and implausible, linguistic so lut ion  s m h  as thecreation of a class of 'level nouns' sb that a box would not be consideredas being or n o t  being level.These points would be generally conceded by those who believe thereisam AX paradigm of language understanding, but there wdlrld be Ear lessagreement over the p s f k i v e  content of the paradigm, The txouble beginswith the def in i t ion  of 'understanding' as applied t o  a computer.
A t  oneextreme are those who say the word can o n l y  rqfer t o  the performance of amachine: to its ability to, say, sustaih dome farm of dialogue long enougharad s e n s b l y  enough for a h w n  interrogator to be unsure whether what heis conversing w i t h  i s  a machine or not.
On the other hand, there are=my, a h s t  certainly  a majority, who argue that more is required, in thatthe msthde and representations of knowledge by which the pexformance i sachieved must be of the r ight  formal sort, and that mere performance based-on ad hoc methods does no t  demonstrate understanding.This issue is closely related to that of  the role  of dqduction i nnatural language understanding, simply because deduction is often thestructure mant when 'right methods' are mentioned.
The dispute betweenthose who argue for, or, like Winograd, use deductive methods, and thosewho dvocate othex inferential systms closer to cammon sense reasoning,is i n  m y  ways a pseudo-issue because it is so d i f f i c u l t  t~ define cltarlyw h a t  a mn-deductive system is, (if by that is  meant a system that cannoti n  principle be lnodellea oy a deductive system) since almost any set offorrpal'procedures, including 'invalid inferences1, can be s o  displayed.The heart of the matter concdrns the  most appropriate kom on an infsrsncesystem, rather #an how t h s s ~  infercncas may be &xim~tisFd, and i t  maywell t u r n  out that the most appmpriatc fom for plausLbla r r a o ~ n i n g  inorder to understand is indocd non-deductive.

I shall r e t u r n  to this last pifit la te r .5.
Second Generation SvstemsTo und'ewstand what was meant when Winograd contrasted h i s  own w i t hwhat he called second generation systems, we have to remember, as alwaysin this s u j e c t ,  that the generations are of fashion, n o t  chronology orinheritance uf i3eas.
He dedcribed the work of Simmons, Schank and myselfamong others in h i s  s-ey of new approaches, even though t h e  foundationsand terminology of those approaches were set out i n  p r i n t  i n  1966, 1968 and1967 respectiyely, What those approaches, and others  have in mmon isthe b e l i e .
t h a k  understanding systems must be able to manipulate verycomplex linguistic ohjects, or semantic structures ,  and t h a t  no simplisticapproaches to understanding language w i t h  computers will wrk.In a very inf luential  recent paper, Minsky (1974) has drawn togetherstrands in the work of Charniak (1972) and the authors above using ateminolagy of 'frames':tvA frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotype situation,like a certain kind of l iv ing  room, or going to a children's birthdayparty, Attached tea each frasne are several kinds of information.
Sbmeof thia is information about how to use the frame, Somc is about whatcne can e x p c t  to happen next, Some is about what to do if those ax-pectatione are not confimed.We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations.
Thetop levels of a frame are fixed and represent things that  are always trueabout the supposed situation.
The lower levels have many terminals ---'slots1 that must be filled by specif ic  instarices or data.
Each terminalcan specify conditions its assignments must meet ....
Simple conditionsa r e  specif ia by markers that might require a terminal assignment to be aperson, an object of sufficient value, e t c .
.
, ,  I IThe key point about, such stxuotures is that they attempt to specifyin advance what is going to be said,  and how the world encountered isgoihg to be structured.
The structures, and the inference r u l e s  thatapply to them, ate also expressions of 'partial information '  (in MKarthytsphrase) that  are not present in f irs t  generation systems.
As I showedaarliar, with the 'women and soldiers' example, such loose inductive inform-ation, seeking confirmation E r o m  the surrounding context, is required forvery s h p l e  sentences.
In psychological and v i sua l  terms, frame approaches~nv isage  cnn undezstander as at ieast as much a looker a?
a seer.Thus, w e  might, very tentatively, begin by i d e n t i f y i q  what Winogradcalled 'second generation' approaches with those making use 05 verygeneral notions akin to what Minsky called 'frames'.
But this is no morethan a temporary device, for convenient initial classification of the field,because later we shall have reason to question the  first-second generationdistinction, and, as noted earlier, Minsky's notion of 'frame' is itself ahighly f h i d  one in the process of definition and refinemgnt.L e t  us now turn briefly to five approaches that might be calledsewnd generation.CharniakThe new work which owes most to Mirrsky I s  advocac,y is Ckarnink s .Hea studied what: sorts uf in forez i t i i z l  infomation Charnlak 7 ' 7 3 ,  ''741would be needed to rrasulm pronoun W i y u i  ties i n  ciai3dren l a s torjCr::,and AJ% that sehso tu understirrail t.htxu.

Charniakts analysisbegins by p i r a t i n g  out that a great deal cf what is required to understandthat story is implicit: Iun~ilrledge aLwut the giving of p~esents, knoililedgethat if one possesses one of a certain s o r t  of thing then one may well notwant another, and *so on,Charniak's system does n o t  actually run as a preyram, but is a theoset-i ca l  s t r u c t u r e  of rules called 'demcnsl khat correspond roughly to whatMinsky later called frames.
A demon for this exanple would be,  If we sopthat a person might not like a present S ,  then lock Pclr S being r e t u r n e d  t othe store where it was bought.

"I'his approach, of using partial { n o t  necessar i ly  true)inferences,  i n  order  to assex t  a definite answer, is highly c h a r a c t e r i s t i cof 'second generat ion'  systems.The demons are,  as with Winoyraa's work, expressed i n  a procedurallanguage which, on running, will seek for a succession of inter-related'goals'.Here, for example, is a demon concerned w i t h  another story ,  about achild's piggy bank (PB) and a child shaking it, looking fcr money b u t  hear-ing no sound.
The demon, PB-OUT-OF, is fomalised as:[DEMM PB-CUT-QF(Horn PB PERsW M N){?N Ollfi-OUM 7PB)EWAL ( 7  IS ?PB PIGGY-BANK))(GOAL (3 IS 324 K N E Y )  qDEDWE)(GOIIL (?NOID S W  ?PERSON 3PB) $TRUE)(ASSERT (?
HAVE: ?PERSON ?M)(ASSERT ('3 RESULT ?N WOLD) ) )Again, it i s  not necessary to explain the notation i n  detail.
to seethat conditions are being stated for the contents of a piggy bank havingk e n  emptied.
The pattern being sought by the demon i n  operation is tirethird l i n e .
TE a c h i n  of demons can 'reacht one of the passiblo xafer-ente i n  a story then there is a suct+ass registered and the ambiguity ofthe corresponding pronoun is resolved.It can be seen that the information encoded in the system is of ahighly specific sort - in the present case it is not about containers assuch, and how to g e t  their contents out, but about Piggy B a n k s  in particular,and everything relies on that partfcular knowledge having been put i n .
N o ta l l  the knowledge is of this general sort: in a recent paper (Charniak '74)whws tha ' k i t e '  stary is reconsidered there are rules ~f considerable gan-rrrsuty snd interest.
One such is that Charniak calis a R+SSA rule:'XE the  .tory give8 information which would make it plausible to infermt PERSON is favourably inclined towards action A, and PERSON does S I  asignif i c m t  subaction (SSA) of A, then f nfer that PERSON is doing AAn important azsumption of Charniakls is what I shal l  call  his'decoupling assunaption', namely that this work on the knowledge-baseddetemahation of reference can be effectively decoupled from any partichlarsyntactic or semantic representation, or of its apgdication, arid can beexplored Fn isolation.
Thus, the apparently English words in the PB-OUT-OFd-n above do not have any particular status ower than that of Englishwords that happen ta occur in the stories being examined.
I shall r e tu rnto this assumption later.Corny has (Colby et a1 '71), (Enea and Colby ' 73 ) ,  (Colby and Parkison,'74) developed over a pezfod of several years an on-line dialogue systemthatsimilatss a paranoid patient called PARRY.

This is analysed into a network of nodes C1, C2, C3, Cd corres-ponding to the appropriate senses of 'John1, 'Bread', 'Windcv' and 'Hammer'respectively.
The linkages between the nodes are labelled by one of thefol lowing 'deep case relations ' : CAUSAL-ACWUtT (a. , CA2) , 'EENS, =US,S03JRC6 and GOAL.
Case relations-are specifications oT thd way dependentparts of a sentencer or concepts corrtesponding to parts o f  a sentence,depend on the main action.
SO, i h  this example, John is the first causalactant (CAI) of the breaking, the hammer is consideted the second causalactant (mi?)
of that breaking, and the window is the theme of the breaking.Thuss the heaxt o f  the analysis could ba repzesented by a diagram as followd:' John C2OF by a s e t  of relational triples:(Cl CAS C2) (Cl CAZ C4I C C ~  l?HE&E.

There i s ,  in the last diag~am, a cextain re-dundancy of expression, but as w e  shall see tn the next section this oftenhappens w i t h  deeper semantic notations.More recently, Schank, together with Rieger, has developed a new classof causal inferences which deepen the diagrams still  further.
So, in theanalysis of 'John's cold improvPQ1 because I gave him an vp le l  (Lrt Scfrank'74a) the extended diagram contains at I h ~ t  four yet lower levels ofcausal =rowing, including one corresponding L.ht the notion of J u h  can-s+Ncting the idea (WBUTLD) that he wants to ea% an apple.
So we can seethat the undexlying explication of mean* here is not only i n  the serlso ofIinpulistlc prLmltLws, but i n  tern of a theory of mental acts as w e l l .N o w  Ulsra ate  a number of genuine ~pos i t i6na] .
difficulties here forthe euml&tator faced w i t h  a epstm of this complexity, One aspect oft h i ~  is the atages of d e v e l o p n t  pf the ~ y s t a m  i tself ,  which can bc seenae a consimtcntpmcesa of produrlng what was argued for i n  advance.
Forekampla, Schank claimed early on to be a constructing system of semanticmtructures undatlyirrp the 'surface of natural language', alehaugh initiallythem were no primitives at all, and qa late as (Schank et a1 '70) therewas only a single primitive TRANS, and most of the entries in the dictionaryconmisted of the Bnylish wards coded, together with subscripts.
Since thanthe primitive system has b&ossomed and &ere are now twelve primitives torhCTS including three Ebr the original TRANS itself .
Each axposition of thesystem recounts its preceding phrases, from the original primitive-free one,throuqh to the present causal inference  form; rather as each human foetusis said to relive in the womb a l l  the evolutionqy stages of the  human race.The only trouble w i t h  this, f x m  an outsider's point  of view, is khat ateach stage the representation has been claimed, to be the correct one, whileat the same ti- S c h d  admits, in moments of candor (Schank '731,  thatthere is no a d  to the conceptual diagrrVbraing oE a sentence.
This d i f f i -culty m y  well reflect genuine problems in language itself, and, in itsacuteat form concerns a three-way confusion between an attractive notat ionfor displaying the 'meanings of wordsv, the course of events i n  the realworld, a d ,  f i n a l l y ,  iibtual procedures for analysis to be based on thediagrams,This raises the ,  to me, inrportant question of the  application of asemantkc system, that I shall touch on again later.
Schank, for example,dues mention i n  passing the questions of wd-sense ambiguity, and the  awfulambiguity of English prepositions, but there are in no way central for him,and he assumes that w i t h  the availability of 'the correct repxesentationWth i s  s y s h  when UnpleIm?nted must inev i tab ly  soive th- traditional and vex-ing questions.
M procedures are hinted at along w i t h  the graphs as tohow tnrs is to be done.
A d i s t i n c t i o n  cof importance may be becoming ap-parent here batween Schank s work and Riegerls: in Riagar's thesis ( R L q e r'74) the rules of inference appear to craatg clclparata and new rubprrphrwnicn may s w d  in an lnfersntial celatlon to each other so as tsl producecloncluaiona &but: ~~~~~a of, gayt  pronoun rabr~ence, etc.

I n  it Schank considsrs the application of h i s  approach to therepraqentation of text ,  and concl :des, correct ly  i n  my tP4etq ,  that the rep-resentations of pa r t s  of the t e x t  must be interconnected.
by causal arrows,and that, i n l o r d m  to present@ 1rv.cidity, the conceptual diagrams for indi-vidoal sentences and their partvi must be abbreviatedr as by triples such asPOEPLE P p l W S  PEOPLE.
her^ indeed, the surface simply has to su rv iw  i n-the representation un1esF one is prepared t o  camit oneself to the axemeview that the ordering OF sentences i n  a text is a purely superf ic ia l  andarbitrary matter.
The F e n s e i n  wnich this is a welcome reversal of a trendshould be clear, because i n  the 'causation inference' development, mentionedearlier, all the consequences and ef fec t s  oE a conceptualization had t o  be-drawn within i t s e l f .
Thus, i n  the extreme case, each sentence of a t e x t7should have been represented by a diagram containing most or  a l l  of Wet e x t  of which it was a part.
Thus- the representation of a t e x t  would hayebeen impossible on such prihciples.Pay own system constructs a semantic representation f o r  small naturallanguage texts: the basic representation is applied d i r ec t l y  t o  the textand can then be 'massaged' by various forms of inference t o  became as deepas is necessary for well defined tasks demonstrating understanding.
Itis a uniform representation, in that information that might convenionall~be considerea as syntactic, s-ntic, factual ox rnrerencial LS weu ax-pressed within a single type o f  struwra.
The fundamental un i t  i n  themnatructioe of th2s beaning representation is the template, which isintmded to correspond to an intuitive notion of a basic message ofagent-action-object fom.
Templates are rigid format networks of morebasic butldlnp blocks called fomulas, which correspond t o  senscln ofindividual worde.
In order to cohskruet a cctnplete t e x t  representationtemplates ate  bound byethat by t w o  kinds of higher level structurescalled p a p l a t e s  and inference rules.
The templates themselves arebuilt up as the construction of  the representation proceeds, but the.formulas, paraplates and jlnference rules are all present in the system,atthe outset and each of these three types of pre-stored structure is ult-irpately constructed frm an inventory of eighty semantic primitive elements,and from functions and predicates ranging over those elements.The system runs on-line as a package of LXSP, k&ISP and MLISP2 pro-gram, W i n g  as input small paragraphs of English, that can -be made up bythe uber from a vocabulary of about 6QO word senses, and p r d u z f n g  a goodFrench t:ransL&tion as output.
This environment provides a pretty cleartea t  of lmguage undarstding, bcauaa E'rench translations for everyday.pmse are either right or wmng, and can be seen' t o  be 910, while a t  the sametitPe, the mfot difficulttee of understanding ptogtams - word sense ambig-ratty, case anbigufty, difficult pronoun reference, etc.
- can a l l  be rep-resented within a machine translation environment by, for example, choosingthe words of Lhe input sentence containing a pronoun reference difficultyso t h & E  the potsible alternative references have different genders in French.In that way the French output mdkes quite clear whether or not the programhas made the correct inferences in order to understand what it is trans-la_ting.
The program is reasonably robust in agtual prformance, and w i l leven tolerate a certain amount ob bad grammar in the input, since it doesnot pzfbm a syrkax a ~ L y s I ; s  &=%he sense, hut snnkn messageforms representable &XI the semantic s m c t u r e s  employed.v p i c a l  input would ble a sentence such as 'John l i v e s  out: QE tQtm hi&inks his wine out of a bottle, Mo than throws the h t t l a s  out uf Uaefor each of tke thraa occurrences of 'out o f t ,  since i t  raslisarrs that theydiffexenco must be reflected in the Fwonch, A sentonce such as, * G i v e  Usemonkeys b;mands although they are not ripe because they a y ~  very I~wQry'produces a translation w i t h  dif ferent  equivalontd fur t)ra tm eccurrmwrof lUaey1, bocause the s y s l m  oorr@ctlp realiasst iraQlSI wlrat 4 s h a l l  describebelow a t  preference considerations, that tlae most sensible intc t~retat icnis one in which the f i r s t  they' refers to the bananas and the second tcthe monkeys, +and bananas and monkeys~have different genders in French.These two e x m p h  are dealt w i t h  i n :  t h e  'basic d e '  of the system.
(Wilks 73a) Inmany cases itcmotxesolve pronoun ambiguities by thesort of straightforward 'preference considerations1 used in t h e  last exaaple,where, roughly speaking, 'ripeness' prefers to &-predicated of plant-likethings, and hunger of animate things, Even in a sentence as s b p l e  as'John drank the wine on the table and it was g d t t  such considerationsaye inadequate to resolve the anbigtlity of 'it' between wine and table,since both m y  be good things.
In such cases, 02 i n a b i l i t y  to ras~lvewith in  its basic moder the program deepens the xepresentatio~ of the t e x tso as to t q  and s e t  up chains of inference that will reach, and su prefer,only one of the possible referents.
I w i l l  return to these pzocesses ina nment ,  but first I s h a l l  give sane brief description of the basic repre-sentat ion s e t  up for English.For each sense of a word in its dictionqxy the program sees a fohula .This is a tree structure of semantic primitives, and is to be interpretedformally using dependency relations.
The main element i n  any fonnula isthe rightmost, called its head, and that is  the fundamental category towhich the fonnula belongs, In the formulas for actions, for example,the head will always be one of the primitives PICK, CAUSE, CHANGE, FEEL,HAVE, PIXME, PAIRl SENSE, USE, ,WANT, TELL, BE, 5X), FQRCE, W,-THINk, FLOW, W, DROP, STRZK, FUNC or HAPN.Here 18 t n t s  eLee stxuctufe for the.
action of drinking:( m u  PART)Qace again, it is n ~ t  necessary to explain the formalism in any deta i l ,to see that this sense of Idrink* is being expressed as a causing to mvea liqyid object (F'WH m) by an animate agent, into that saine agent (con-tainment case indicated by IN, and formula syntax identifies SELF w i t h  thB+gent) and via (direction case) an aperture (TLIRU PART) of the agent.Template structures, which actually represent sentences and theirparts are built up as netwcrks of formulas like the one above.
Templatesalways cons ia t  o f  an agent nude, and action node and an object node, andother: nodes ttat laay depend on these.
Sot in building a template for'John drinks,wine', the whole of the above tree-formula for 'drinks'  wouldbe piaced at the central action node, another tree structure for 'John' atthe agent node and so on.
The complexity of the system comes from the wayi n  which the formulas, considered as active entities, dictate how otherplaces hn the same template should be filled.Thus, the 'drink1 formula above can be thought of as an entity thatfits at a template action node, and seeks a liquid object, that is ~ saya f~rmula w i t h  (FLOW STUFF) as its right-most bzanch, to put at the objectnoda of the same template.
This seeking is preferential, in that formulasnot satisfying that requirement will be accepted.

There are special 'less preferred1 oaliersto deal w i t h  fragments not in agent-acti~n-object order, and so on.men the local inferences have been done that s e t  up the agest-actionobject templates for fragments of input text,  Shd system attempts tm t i ethese templates together so as to provide an overall initial structure foxthe input.
One form of this is the anaph,oxa t i e ,  o-f the sort discussed f o gthe monkeys and bananas example above, but the =re general ?om is the  casetie.
Assignment of these would result in the template far the last clauseof 'He ran the mile in a paper bag' being tid to the action &e of t h etemplate for the first clause ('He ran t h e  mile'), and the tie k i n g  l ~ ~ ~ e dCONTaiment.
These case ties are made with the aid of-another class ofordered stxuctues,  essentially equivalen* to FMlrPore s case f ruses, calledprap la te s  and which are a t t a h e a  t~ the formulas for English prepositions8.SO, for 'outof', for =aaple ,  there h-ould be at Least six ordered paraplates,each of which Is a string of functions that seek inside templates for inform-ation.
In general, paraplates range across t w o ,  nat necessarily contiguous,templates.
So, in analysing 'He put the n u h r  he thought of i n  the table ' ,the successfully matching paxaplatz would p i n  down the  dependence OP thetemplate for the last of the three clauses a s  DIREctior., by W i n g  as  amp-ment only that particular template for the l a s t  clause that contained theformula for 'a numerical table' ,  (and - not  a template repxesenting a kitchentable) and a t  would do that because of a function i n  that paraplate seekinga similarity, of head (SIGN in this case) between the t t~m appropriate objecr,ConqularJ for ~numbarl and 'tabla'.

In this&a, new template-like forms are extracted fran existing ones, and thenadded to M e  template pool ftom which further inferences can be made.
So,i n  Ula t m ~ l a t a  derived earlier for 'John drinks wine ' ,  the system entersthe Loarula for 'drinks', and draws inferences corresponding to coach casesub-Eorrmula.
In this t~xtmple it will derive template-like forms equivalentto, in omJf~ry English, 'The wine is in J o b t ,  'The wine entered John viaan aperture' and so on.
The extracted templates express information a l -ready implicitly preser.t i n  the text, wen though many of them are partialinferences: anes that may not necessaxily, be true.-n-sense inference rules are then brought down, which attempt, bya s-fe strertegy, ta construct the shortest possible chain of rule-linkedtmmplate fo-8 from one containing an ambiguous pronoun, say, 50 one c2n-t a i n h g  one of its ~ s s i b l e  referents.
Such a chain then constitutes asolution ta the ambiguity problem, and the preference approach assumes thatthe shartest chain is always [the right one.
So, Yn the case of 'Jahn dranktha wine /on the table/ and it was good', (in three temprate-matching frag-menb as shewn) the camact chain t~ 'wine' uses the two rules* Wibo '73b, and @n preera).

**In a recent paper (1974), Charniak gives much more general-rules, suchas his 'rule of significant sub-action', mentioned earliw.If I were a reasanably Eluent spaker of, say, G8man, 1 might we13not understand a G e m  conversation about birthday presents unless Z hadtietailed 8factuaS.

It seems to me not afuolish question to ask whether much of what appears to be about naturallanguage in A.I.
research is in fact about language a t  all, Even if itis nbt that may in no way detract fran its value.
Newell (blolore, Newollq 7 3 )  has argued that A .

work is in fact 'theoretical psychology', inwhich case it ceul8 hardly be research - on natural language, When describ-ing Winograd's work earlier in the paper, Z raised this question in a weakfarm by asking whether his definition o f  Ipickup1 had anything to da withthe natural language use of  the word, or whether it was rather a descriptionof how his system picked samething up, a quite different matter.Suppose we generalize this query samewhat, by asking the apparentkyabsurd question of what would be wrong w i t h  cal l ing,  say, Charniakls workan essay on the 'Socio-Economic Behaviour of American Children Under Stress?I n  the case of Charniak's work this i s  a facetious question, asked only inorder to make a point, but with an increasing number of systems in A .
I .being designed not essentially to do research on natural language, but i norder to have a natural language ' f ron t  end' to a s y s t m  that is essentiallyintended to  predict chemical spectra, or play snakes and ladders or whateverthe question becomes a serious one.
It seems to me a good time to askwhether we ahould expect advance in understanding natural language fromthose tackling the problems head on, or those coroncerned to build a 'fr8ntandv.
It i~ cLtt,xly the case that - a n p i e c e  coulLbp esrcntial to the understanding of sane story.
The question is, doesit follow that the epehifict.tion, organieation and formalization of thatknowldge l a  &a studf oP l : .
a g a ,  because i f  it is then all human enquiryftm physics and history to medicine is a linguistic enterprise.
And, ofcowrr,  that poaskbil i ty has actually been entertained within certain strainsof d a r n  philosophy.itowaver, I am not w i n g  hefa, to breathe fresh life into a philosophicaldistinction,  batween being aLuut lmpunge and - not being about language, buttather introducing a practical distinction, (which is also a considerationin favour of optiqg, a3 I have, to work on very general and central areasof howledge) between specific knowledge, and central knowledge withoutwhich a syartem could not be said to unilexsttind the language at a l l .
For1example, I might know nothing of the arrangement of American birthdayparties, but could not be accused of not understanding English even though Ifailed understand sme pazticular 'children's story.
Yet, if I did nothave available acme very general partial inference such as the ane peoplebainq hurt an8 fallingr or one about people e*avouring to possess thingsthat they w a n t ,  then it quite possible that my lack of understanding ofquits airtple aentencee would cause observers to think that I did not under-r W  Englbsh.
An interesting and difficult question that then arises i swhether those who concentrate on central and less central areas of discousecould, i n  principle, weld their bodies of inferences together in such a :gayas to create a wider system: whether, to put the matter another way,natural language is a whole that can be built up fxm parts?Pken-noloqica levelAnother distinction that can be confused w i t h  the central-specificone is that of the lphencmenological levels1 of inferences in an under-standing system.
I mean nothing daunting by the phrase: consider theaction eating which is, as smatter of matmica1 fact, quite often anact of bringing the bones of my ulna and radius (in my arm) close to thato f  my lower mandible (my jaw).
Yet clearly, any syatQIP OP CCEPgeK).n senseinferences that considered such a truth when reasoning about eating wouldbe making a mistake.

system that wade everydayinferences about physical objects by mnsiQaring their quantum structure.Schank's analysis of eating rontaias the  inf'matian &st it  la  doneby uovirsg the hands to the mukh, and it might be argued that yven ulis isgoisrg too far ftom the '@aaningl of eating, whataver that m y  bar towsrdsgenerally true information about ma act which, if always inferred &uta U  acts of qating, w i l l  carry the systesrs nruamageably fax.Therq is no denying that t h i s  sort of infomatioar might be useEul tohave around somewhere; Wt, in Minsky's terms, the 'default1 value of theinstrument for eating i s  the  hand brought to the mouth, so that,  if we haveno contrary infomation, then that is the way to a s s u e  that any g f v m  a c tof eating was performed.
Nonetheless, there c l e a r l y  is a danger, and t h a tis a l l  X am drawing at tent ion to here, of taking inferences to a phenolnencwldgical level beyond that of uammn sense.
A clearer case, in my view,would be Schank's analysis (1974a) of mental.

This is clearly a level of ana lys i s  untrue toc a u m n  sense, and which can have only harmful effects in a systea intendedto mimic corxlaPon sense reasoning and understanding.DemuplingAnother general issue in dispute concerns what I shall c a l l  demupling,which i s  whethex ox not  the actual parsing of t e x t  or dialogue into an 'under-standing system.'
is essential.
Charniak and Minsky b e l i e v e  that t h i s  in-itial 'parsing1 can be effectively decoupled from the in teres t ing  i n f e r e n t i a lwork and simply Qssumed.
But, in my view, that is n o t  so, because many ofthe later inferences would actually have to be done already, i n  order to haveachieved the initial parsing.
For example, i n  analysing 'He shot her with acolt', we cannot ascribe any structure at all until we'can make the infexencesthat guns rather than horses are instruments fo r  shooting, and so such asentence cannot be represented by an 'inference-but-no-parsing' structure,without aremi- that language doas not have one of its esgential char-aeteristlca, namely ayptemrrtie ambiguity.
The essence of decoupling isallowing roprersntational etructures to have significance quite  indtlpend-ant of theirapplication, and that may lead one to a eituatMh lotessentially ditfstont frm that of the logician who simply asserts thatouch-and-much ie the 'right structuxel of sme sentence.The inferences required t o  resolve word aense ambiguities, and thosead tb reaolva pronoun reference pxobletast are not of different typos1oftan the two pmblaas occur i n  a eingle sentence and must be resolved to-gether.
But Chatniak's decoupling has the effect of completely separatingthese two closely related liniguistic phenomena i n  what seems to me an un-raallstic aanner.
H i s  system does inferencing to resolve pronoun ambig2uttfes ,  while sense ambiguity is presumably to be done in the future bysapre other, ulti.mately remupled, syste'~.
*Wodulari tyMadularity concerns the deccwposability af a firogran or system i n t o(interacting) parts, and fhe nature of the relationship between t+e parts.Winograd's program, as we saw, contains syntactic, semantic and deductiveBegmentJ which interact in a way he describes as 'heterarchicl (as oppo$edto 'hierarchic8) which means that different w e n t s  can be in controlaatd i f  foreht tiswc .Qn the other hand, S c W  and W i l k s  have argued that it is n o t  nec-esaaty ta absarve efther the syntactic-semantic, or the semantic-deductive,dlatfnctlon i n  an understanding program.
On that view there 0 no par-t;icular,virtue i n  integrating syntax and semantic rbutlnes, since +here wasno need tm separate them.Charniak, h ~ ~ v e r r  w b l d  argue tha t ,  in same sensg, one should makqa syntax-setplantics distinction here if one c+n.
This would be consisteritwith his view on decoupling, and for him it wuld  be convenient to de-couple at a module, as it were, such as syntactic analysis.

Schank clearly believes theanswer to this question is yes, but that cannot be considered establishedby the scale of cmputat ions yet described in print.A suitable envir-ent in which to consider tke question is that  oftranslation from one language to another: suppose we are analyging asentence containing the word 'nail1 meaning a physical object.

Xn the case of Colby's patterns, for example, the form of theirapplication to the input English is clear, even theugh the @a&hing in-volved could be achieved by many different implementation algorithms.
Xnthe case of my awn system, I hold the same tio Be true of the templatestzructurres, even though the time the input has reached the canonicaltemplate form it is considerably different from the input surface structure.The system a t  We extxeme end of any scale of perspicuity of application isWincgradls wheke the procedural notation, by its nature, tries to make clearthe way FR which the structures are applied.

* This i s  not meant to be j u s t  bland assertion.
I have written at samelength on the relations between application and the theoretical statusof linguistic theories in (Wilks ' 74 ) .
**The differences between Minsky's (19741 notion of 'default value' andwhat I have called 'prefexence' can be pointed up in terms of application.M h s Q  suggests 'gunt as the default value of the instrument of %he actionof shooting, but I would claim that, in an example like the earlier 'Heshot her w i t h  a colt ' ,  we heed to be able to see in the structure assignedwhether or not  what is offered as the apparent instrument is in fact aninstrument and whether it 'is the default or riot.
In other words, we needsufficient structure of application to see not only that 'shcotlng1 pre-fers an instrument &at is a gun, but also why it will chaose the senseof 'colt1 thatcis a gun rather than the one which is a horse.ATtlx>ugh Schank sametinee writes of a system making 'all possible1inferences a8 it p10ceBd8 though a textt this i e  not in fact the hearto t  tho dispute, since no one would want ta defend my atmng definittioroL the tom 'all poesibla infetences'.

This i s r  in very crude summary, Charniak's caseagainst a purely ptoblw-driven inferencer in a natural language under-stander ,A ditficulty w i t h  this.argument is the location of an axample of textthat c~nffrms the pofnt in a ncn-contentious manner.
Chatniak has foundan excerpt ftcm a book describing the l i f e  of apes in which it is indeedhard to locate the reference of a particular pronoun in a given passagQ.Chamiak's case is that it is only possible to do so i f  one has made eert-aln inon-prublm occasioned) inferances earliez in the story.
But anuabet QE readers find it quite hard tb refer that particuXe pronoun any-wayl which might s w e e t  that, the t ex t  was simply badly written.Another d i f f i cu l ty  16 that it is not always clear whether the argumentis about what p p l e  are thought to do when they understand, or about howone should mnstruct an wdexstandLng system.
This  is a d i f f i c u l t  matterabout which to be precise: it would be possible, for example, to agree withCharniakts argurnentmd still construct a 3urely problem-driven inferenceron the ground that, at the mment, t h i s  is the onlv way one can cope with t h evast majority of inferences for understanding, since any system of inferencesmade Fn response to no particular problem in me text  is too hard to controlin practice.
Indeed, it i s  noticeable t h a t  the mst recent papers of Schank(1974a and 1974b) and Charniak (1974) have been considerably less forward-inference oriented than earlier ones.This Bispute fs prhaps m l y  one of degree;&nb about tha posalbil-i t y  of befining a degree af forward inf~rlene~e that alds the a d u t i s n  o flater semantic problem without going Lntta w w e ~ s r r y  depth.
