Anaphorie Reference to Events and Actions:A Representation and its AdvantagesEthel SCHUSTERDepartment of Computer and Information ScienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6389AbstractTiffs paper focuses on anaphora interpreted as referring t'o en-tities of type event and action.
It considers two issues: (i) whataspects of the discourse give evidence of the events and the actionsthe speaker is talking about, and (ii) how actions and events arerepresented in the discourse in order to be able to refer to themanaphorically.1 IntroductionWhen people speak or Write, they refer to things, objects, events,actions, facts or states that they (or other people) referred to be-fore.
They use certain words to "refer" or "point" to those things:previously mentioned.
Such context-dependent reference is called,anaphora, and the words used to "refer" are called anaphors.Some examples of anaphors include pronouns uch as he, she, it'and noun phrases that contain this; that, these and those.
Considerfor example the following pair of sentences:(1) U: I want to move a 0lock of text as a unit.
How do I do it?The it in the second sentence is the anaphor which points backto the action that the user wants to perform, described in the firstsentence.In our communications, we benefit from the use of anaphoricforms which make our interactions more coherent and intelligible.If we were forced to describe verything explicitly, our discoursewould become very complex, long and time-consuming.
Moreoverit could become confusing and lead to potential misunderstand-ings.
Such is the case in the following example which is similarto example (1) but in which a pronoun is not used in the secondsentence:(2) U: I want to move a block of text as a unit.
How do I movea block of  text as a unit?We as listeners may find these-sentences v ry odd and lackingcoherence.
We may wonder about he need to repeat the descriptionwhich has already been introduced.
If the speaker fails to use thepronoun, 'the listener may believe that he is meant to concludesomething special from this unnatural usage.
This conclusion maybe unwarranted.The work we present here describes the process of dealing withanaphoric language when the reference is to events and actions.It considers two issues: (i) what aspects of the discourse giveevidence of the events and the a~tions the speaker is talking about,and (ii) how actions and events are represented in the discourse inorder to be able to refer to them anaphoricaUy.
The overall goal isto make natural-language communication between human beingsand machines more robust and coherent.
This can be done byproviding computer systems with the ability to adequately generate602and interpret text which includes anaphoric references toevents andactions in a similar way to how human beings do it.
To illustratethe problem that we are dealing with, we use some examples takenfrom a set of natural anguage transcripts about the EMACS texteditor.
The users were given a task to perform using EMACS andat the same time they were able to ask an expert about he variousthings they could do in EMACS.
The goal of the interaction wasfor the users to learn how to use the EMACS editting system.In the next section we will describe how we view discoursemodels along with the representation f entities which form partof them.
In section 3 we describe a representation f those entitiesbased on the language used.
We propose a generalization f thatrepresentation which allows us to have access to the different enti-ties characterized by the text.
In section 4 we relate the proposedrepresentation with the particular pronouns used to refer to events,based on some data analysis.
We conclude by giving a brief sum-mary of what the advantages of the proposed representation are.2 Discourse ModelsAn overall concern of this work is to describe how communicationis done via discourse.
A piece of discourse is a set of sentencesor pieces of text that are spoken by one or more speakers.
Whenwe talk about discourse, we usually indicate the fact that thosesentences in the discourse are connected in some way that makesthem comprehensible and coherent.
Speakers do so by attemptingto get their listeners to construct an appropriate model: a discoursemodel.
A discourse model is viewed as containing representationsof entities, along with their properties and relations they partici-pate in \[Webber 1982, Helm 1982, Kamp 1984\].
The key, then, insuccessful communication is for the speaker to transmit as muchinformation about hose representations of the entities, their prop-erties and relations to the listener.
Usually, this cannot be done in asingle utterance, so it requires reference back to things mentionedpreviously.
The speaker refers to a particular representation f aperson, object, action or event in his or her discourse model andhe or she can do so by using a pronoun, a definite noun phrase,or a form such as do it, do that.
The speaker expects the listenerto (i) have in his or her discourse model a representation for thoseobjects, actions or events (or to be able to create one with mini-mal effort), and (ii) make the link between the referent 1 and therepresentation f the entity.Discourse ntities can represent objects, sets, actions, events,and facts which are viewed as individuals.
The referent of a def-inite pronoun is then an entity in the speaker's discourse modelwhich, given the goal of the communication, is expected to existXReseareh in linguistics has defined the problem of anaphom asthat of findingthe antecedent of an anaphoric expression, that is, finding the word or phrase towhich the anaphor is linked.
In this work, the problem of anaphom is definednot solely as that of identifying the antedecent but how the referent is found.We consider the antecedent tobe the linguistic text which gives rise to an entity,as compared toa referent which is a non-linguistic entity.also in the listener's model, hi the next section, we describe howdiscourse ntities describing events or actions can be representedin a discourse model in order to indicate what they make availablefor future reference.3 Formalizing the Representation3.1 CharacterizationFirst, let us consider what characterizes actions or events.
In gen-eral, each sentence gives rise to an event.
Similarly, an action isconsidered to be part of that event.
As a way to establish the differ-ences linguistically, we describe actions as being characterized bythe predicate of the sentence (the verb phrase) and events as beingcharacterized hy the whole sentence.
Therefore, we consider ac-tions to be part of events.
This notion is similar to Jackendoff's whonotes that "sentences that express \[ACTIONS\] are a subset of thosethat express \[EVENTS\]" \[Jaekendoff 1983\] (p. 179).
He proposesintroducing "what happened was" as a diagnostic for \[EVENTS\]and "what x did" as a diagnostic for \[ACTIONS\].
So we have(3) What happened was that the pig ran away.
~ EVENTand(4) What Fled did was run away.
~ ACTIONWithiu this view, "an \[EVENT\] that is also an \[ACTION\] involvesa character with a special role- the one who is performing the\[ACTION\]," called the \[ACTOR\] (p. 180).Consider for example:(5) Mary deleted the region.Here, the action of deleting, which occurred in some past time,was performed by Mary and it was done on the region.
2 The'delete' action relates Mary and the region.Events correspond to the conjunction of the action predicatewith other predicates described in the sentence such as time, place,along with the agent performing the action.
Tense and aspect usu-ally indicate the sense of time in an event.
The tense indicatespresent, past, or future and the aspect indicates the perfect (com-pletion) and progressive (continuous) forms.
In general, they areindicated syntactically by certain verbs and/or the auxiliaries.
Forinstance, the auxiliary verb gives us a sense of whether the eventis occurring (presen0, occurred (past), will occur (future) or is justhypothesized-as well as whether an event is continuous or it hasbeen completed.
3 Events and actions usually have associated withthem a time interval.
This time interval can have a well definedbeginning and/or end.
There may also exist events which occur aspoints, that is, their beginning and end times are the same as wellas those in which there is no end or no beginning.
These are amongthe issues that provide us with information about the event or theaction.
There is a vast literature of these subjects including worksby \[Vendler 1967, Mourelatos 1978, Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1986,Moens et al 1987, Passonneau 1987\] to mention some.2In EMACS, a region is a block of text defined by the mark at one end andthe cursor at the other end.
More precisely, it is the area of the buffer betweenthe dot and the mark.aEnglish as two divisions for aspect: (i) Progressive (verb to be and theverbal form -ing) and non-Progressive, and (it) Perfect (verb to have and PastParticiple) and mm-PerfecL English also has a separate Habitual (which occursonly in the past tense), using the auxiliary form used to.
The habitual can bereplaced by its non-habitual equivalent, i.e.
the non-habitual does not excludehabitual meaning \[Comrie 1976\].To summarize, our characterization f events is based on indi-vidual sentences.
Each event includes an action predicate which,along with other predicates describing tense, aspect, and the agentperforming the action constitutes the particular event.3.2 Representation f EventsGiven our characterization f events and actions as described be-fore, and assuming a syntactic representation foreach sentence, thenext step is to describe the kind of (semantic) representation weuse to characterize those events.
Many representations for eventshave been proposed to handle similar issues as we describe here\[Davidson 1967, Moore 1981, Neale 1987\].
The representation wehave chosen is AProlog, a fortnaI logical representation describedby \[Miller et al 1986\].
This approach allows us to represent enti-ties describing events and actions in a logical and complex way.
Inthis representation, the logical form describes the events that char-acterize the sentence (as compared to a proposition or individual),therefore allowing subsequent references to any one of the eventsdescribed by the sentence.
For example,(6) Mary types control-W.which is usually represented astype(Mary, control-W),will get mapped onto the following semantic representation:3v\[type( Mary,  control-W, v)\],which posits an individual typing event following \[Davidson 1967\].From this semantic representation, we obtain the action describedby the sentence which corresponds to its predicate (e.g.
'typecontrol-W' in this example).
This action can be represented interms of )~ predicates as in,Ax.\[tvpe( x, control-W, e)\].The sentence characterizes an event description which is rep-resented asE : Ae.\[type(Mary, control-W, e) A present(e)\],meaning that E is an entity describable as 'the event in whichMary types control-W'.
This is the entity associated with the eventdescription characterized by the sentence.
Present(e) means thatthe event occurs now.
4 As a way of illustrating the representation,consider an example:(7) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.which can be represented asfollows:during(daylight_hours, e) Ain(Philadelphia, e) A past(e)\].4\[Hobbs 1985\] describes a similar approach by introducing what he calls a"nominalization" operator ' : p ~ p':Corresponding to every n-ary predicate p there will be an (n+ 1)-ary predicate p' whose first argument can be thought of as thecondition that holds when p is true of the subsequent arguments.Thus if run(1) means that John runs, run'(E,l) means that E isa running event by John, or John's running ......
The effect ofthis notational maneuver is to provide handles by which variouspredications can be grasped by higher predications (p. 62).603Here, E(r)-~ can be described as 'the event in which John wasshot in broad.daylight in Philadelphia') E(r)4 corresponds to thereal world event description in which John was shot which tookplace at a time during the daylight_hours, in Philadelphia.
z is theperson who did the shooting, who is not explicitly mentioned inthe sentence.
Here, past(e) is defined aspast(e ) --?, time(e) < now.So E(r)-~ makes a predication about the event in which John wasshot and the details that form part of that predication.Given this representation f the event, the next issue is how togenerate references to that event.
That is, we want to be able togenerate references to (7) as in:(8) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.
It happenedat 10 am.it = the event in which John was shot in broad daylight inPhiladelphia.
(9) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.
It shockedme very much.it = the event in which John was shot in broad daylight inPhiladelphia.
(10) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.
It has neverhappened before.it = an event in which someone was shot in broad daylightin Philadelphia.
(11) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.
AI Pacinohad done it last year in a warm summer evening in New YorkCity.it = shoot someone/John.
(12) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.
That wouldnever happen in BogotLthat = an event in which someone was shot in broad daylight.As seen in these examples, the referents of the pronouns mayhave been introduced explicitly.
That is, the anaphoric expressionin the second sentence can refer to the specific event as charac-terized by the sentence or to a less specific event than the onedescribed by the sentence.
Therefore, what we need is to haveaccess to the specific event description along with more generalevent descriptions of the one characterized by the sentence.
Thisrepresentation allows us to do so by being able to perform a gen-eralization on the specific event description as we show in the nextsection.3.3 Generalization of Event DescriptionsIn general, each event represented as described in the previoussection denotes a set of events.
Given that there are entities cor-responding to events represented in the discourse model, each ofwhich can have one or more descriptions, we can generalize toobtain the various descriptions.
Generalization is defined as fol-lows: Given an event description E1 and an event description E2,5As pointed out by \[Sidner 1982\], referring expressions specify discourse n-tities; referring expressions may co-specO~y the same discourse entity; discourseentities represent objects or events in the world and people refer to objects andevents in the world when they use referring expressions.we say that E1 generalizes E2 if every event description denotedby E2 is a member of the set of event descriptions denoted by El.6As we generalize tile representation f the event that we haveobtained for each sentence, we incrementally obtain event descrip-tions of that event.
These event descriptions are available in thediscourse model for future reference.
The generalization of theevents fits in an ordered structure in which the most specific repre-sentation (corresponding to the description of the event character-ized by the original sentence) is at the bottom and the most generalat the top.
So if we consider (7) again(7) John was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.along with its representationE(7)-1 : Ae.\[3x\[shoot(z, John, e)\] Aduring(daylight_hours, e) Ain(Philadelphia, e) A past(e)\].We can generalize it to 'any person y'  (being shot) as follows:E(r)-2 : ~e.\[3x3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\] Aduring(daylight_hours, e) Ain(Philadelphia, e) A past(e)\].We can further generalize to 'any place p' and obtain:Eft)-3: Ae.\[~x3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\] Aduring(daylight_hours, e) h3p\[in(p, e)\] A past(e)\].And we can continue to generalize this last representation a dobtain the following:E(7)-4 : Ae.\[3x3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\] Aduring(daylight_hours, e) Apast(e)\].E(,)-5 : Ae.\[3z3y\[shoot(z, y, e)\] ^  3p\[in(p, e)\] A past(e)\].E(,).~ : Ae.\[3~3y\[shoot(x, y, e)\] ^  past(e)\].Eft)-,:  Ae.\[3x3y\[shoot( x, y, e)\]\].As specified by the generalization, every member of E(r)-~ is amember of E(r)-r. This set of generalizations can be ordered in agraph-like structure as shown in Fig.
1.In this structure, which provides a partial ordering of the events,some events are more specific than others.
The structure is partiallyordered, with the < relation.
7 We have not generalized to 'anytime t' in the !during' predicate because all events occur duringsome time.
Note that at the very bottom of our graph we couldgeneralize on the predicate 'shoot' so as to have an event describing"somebody doing something" which is common to all events.
Wehave chosen not to do so in order to have access to the initialreferent of the pronoun, characterized by the predicate of the event.The generalization structure provides the potential referents forthe pronoun s as they appear in examples (8), (9), (10), (12), and(11).
Consider for instance, the pair of sentences in (10), wherethe referent of the pronoun it in the second sentence is "an event in6This definition is based on Millet and Nadathur's definition of subsumption(= generalization).
They define it in terms of concepts as follows: "a conceptCa subsumes another concept (?2 if every element of the set denoted by C~ isa member of the set denoted by C1" lMitlet et al1986\] (13.
6).7A relation ~ is called a partial order if it is reflexive (p ~ p), anti-symmetric(p "< q A q ~_ p ==~ p = q), and transitive (p ~_ q A q ~ r ~ p "< r).604most specificEO)-I :Ae.\[3x \[shoot(x, John, e)\].during(daylight_hours, e)in(Philadelphia, e)pa~t(e)\],LE(1)-2 :during(daylight_hours, e)in(Philadelphia, e)past(e)\]Eo)-a :he.\[3x3y\[shoot(x, y, e)\]during(daylight_hours, e)3p\[in(p,e)\]past(e)\]/E0)-5 :~e.\[3x3y\[shoot(x, y, e)\] ^3p\[in(p, e)\] Apast(e)\]\E0)-~ :Ae.\[3x3y\[shoot(x,y,e)\] Apast(e)\]1E(x)-7 ::~e.\[~z y\[st,.oot(x, y, e)\]\]most generalE(1)-4 :he.\[3x3y\[shoot(x, y, e)\]during(daylight_hours , e)past(e)\]/Figure 1: Generalization of 'John was shot in broad daylight inPhiladelphia'which someone was shot in broad daylight in Philadelphia.,".
Thisevent description is E(7)-4 which is available in the generalizationgraph.
The same is true for the pair of sentences in (11) wherethe referent of the pronoun it is E(7).7, and the pair (12) where thereferent of the pronoun that in the second sentence is E(r)-s, bothof which are available thru the generalization graph.Bauerle has proposed an alternative method for dealing withevent reference within the framework of Disconrse RepresentationTheory (DRT) \[Kamp 1984\].
As he points out, the problem is notthat simple because by introducing an event-argument, thepossiblereferents for event-anaphora are only linked to the event-token (thespecific event description) and not to the type (the generalizeddescriptions) \[Bauerle 1988\] (p. 21).
The representation utlinedin this paper does provide us with access to the event-token andits generalization allows us to obtain the types.4 Relationship between Pronouns and theirReferentsIn addition to relating a particular pronoun and its referent, eitheras a specific event-token or as an event-type obtained from thegeneralization f the event-token, there are cases in which the pro-noun is also linked to not just an'individual event but to either asequence of events or even a particular event within a sequence(usually the last event in the sequence).As described in \[Schuster 1988\], we have studied the relation-ship between the pronouns and their referents, within a given textdescribing a sequence of events.
We focused on the use and inter-pretation of tim pronouns it and that when referring those eventsand/or actions, given the representation described in tbe previoussection.
Initially, we were interested in identifying tile relationshipbetween a specific pronoun such as that or it and an event as itsreferent.
We found out that a particular pronoun could act as areferent of one of the following:1.
One event.2.
A sequence of events, the pronoun referring to the entiresequence as one.3.
The last event in a sequence."4.
A pair of events related by two possible relations: genera.tion and enablement, as proposed by \[Goldman 1970\] anddeveloped by \[Pollack 1986a\].We will describe ach one of'these cases, along with some examplesand relate them to the representation we introduced in section 3.1.
One event Consider the following text:(13) E: Write a simple macro that does three forward char-aeters.
Try that.We can represent the first sentence in the pair as describedbefore:E(13)-I : Ae.\[\[write(U, 3fe_macro, e)\] A present(e)\].Here, E03}-x can be described as 'the event in which U writesa simple macro that does three forward-characters, and takesplace at the present time'.
U in this case is the user interact-ing with the expert.
Then, the referent of the pronoun thatin the second sentence is the event represented asE03)-l.6052.
A sequence of events Consider:(14) E:.To kill a region, the whole tiring at one time youshould set the mark- (esc)-M-at he top of the region,then move the cursor down to the bottom of the regionand type (esc)control-K.
This will kill the region.The pronoun this refers to the entire sequence of events.As in the previous case, if we represent each sentence as aAexpression, we have access to the various descriptions ofthe event corresponding to each sentence and we can referto them via the pronoun.3.
Last event Consider the following example, where the pronounit refers to the last event in the sequence:(15) E: To kill a word, you have to move tbe cursor to thebeginning of that word and type control-D. Go ahead,do it.4.
Generation and Enablement In analyzing the data we'foundthe need for two important relationships: generation andenablement \[Pollack 1986b\].
Generation is defined as fol-lows: If an agent performs one action and thereby, withoutany effort on his/her part, does another, then we can saythat his/her performance of the former action "generated"the performance of the latter.
For example,(16) E: Do this: set a "mark" at some point (any 01d point)by typing (esc)-M. It will say "mark set", try it.
(17) E: (esc)-M will give set-mark.
Do it.In both cases, the referent(s) of the pronoun it can be either"setting the mark" or "typing (esc)-M" or even both: "settingthe mark by typing (esc)-M".
By viewing the referent interms of the generation relationship, we can claim that "Utyping (esc)-M at a given time generates U setting the markat that given time".
This relationship allows us to refer toboth or either of the referents without having to make adistinction between the two of them.
Note that generation isa relationship between the specific events, the event-tokensand not the types.Enablement, as opposed tO generation, has been describedas follows: if an agent performs an action and thereby putsthe world in a state in which a second action will generatea third action, then we can say that the agent's performanceof the first action enables the generation of the third by thesecond.
For example,(18) U: I want to move the cursor 20 characters tothe right.How can I do it?E: Like all other commands in EMACS, these com-mands can be given arguments which cause them to beexecuted repeatedly.
The way you give a command arepeat count is by typing control-U and then the digitsbefore you type the command.
For instance, control-U20 (RIGHT-ARROW} moves forward 20 characters.Go ahead, try that.In .this example, the pronoun that refers to the entire en-ablement relationship: "U typing control-U enables a givennumber (20) and the RIGHT-ARROW key to be typed whichin term generates the cursor to move 20 characters forward".U typing control-U is viewed as an enablement relationship:if U does not type control-U and only types 20 followed bythe RIGHT-ARROW, U's desired goal of making the cursormove 20 characters forward will not be accomplished.To summarize, for each representation f the individual eventscharacterized by each sentence, we can relate the pronoun to theevent, to a sequence of events, or to events related by either thegeneration or enablement relationships.5 SummaryWe have defined an approach for representing actions and events indiscourse in order to refer to them anaphorically.
The main concernhas been to describe what aspects of the discourse give evidence of?
events and actions and how these vents and actions are representedin order to refer to them appropriately.
This representation has'the advantage that it allows us to create appropriate descriptionsof actions and events which are available for future reference inthe discourse model.
We have shown how to generalize vent?
descriptions, o that the general event descriptions can in turn beassociated with additional event entities required by the use ofparticular anaphoric expressions.
We have also related the eventrepresentation described here to anaphoric pronouns, given that thepronouns can refer to more than one event.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by ARO grant DAAG29-84-K-0061,DARPA grant N00014-85-K-0018, and NSF-CER grant MCS82-19196 to the University of Pennsylvania.
