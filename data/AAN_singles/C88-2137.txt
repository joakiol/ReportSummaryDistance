h this paradigm, natural anguage understandingis viewed a; an effort to recognize input sentences by usingp~c-cxisting knowledge in memory, which is often experien.-tial aud cpi:;odic.
It is contrasted with traditional models ofparsing in which syntactic and semantic representations itrebuilt as the result of parsing and are normally lost after eachparse.
In the DMA model, input sentences are identified withthe memory sU'ucture which represents he input, and are in-stantiatcd to represent flint specific input.
Since understandingis performed as recognition through the memoly network, theresult of understanding is ~aot lost after each sentence is pro-cessed.
Also, since parsing and memory-based inferences areintegrated, ~arious memory~based activities emt be triggereddirectly through natural language understanding without sep-arate inferential processes.As on~' application of DMA, at the Center for Machine"l?anslatioil (CMT) at Carnegie Mellon University, we havedeveloped a natucal anguage interface for our large-scaleknowledge-based machine translation system t called DM-(~OMMAND.
This application of DMA demonstrates the powerof this m(~lcl, since direct access to memory during parsing al-lows dyna,~dc evaluation of input commands and question an~~we~ing without running separate inferential processes, whiledynanfic~d~y utilizing the MT system's already existing do-,~lahl 13~owlcdge sonrces~ The implementation f the DMAaTtte CM!3-MT systcin which is the target system fo~ tic DMoCOiV~r?~AND sy:~tem described in this paper is described in detail in Tomita-&Cmbtmell\[1987\] and Mitamufa, et a/t1988\].natural anguage system has been completed and is used fordevelopment of actual grammars, domain knowledge-bases,and syntax/semantic mapping rules by the researchers atCMT.This system has been demonstrated to be highly effective asa MT developmental support system, since researchers whodevelop these individual knowledge sources are otherwise un-knowledgeable about the internal implementation f the MTsystem.
The DMA natural anguage interface can provideaccess (currently English and Japanese) to the system's inter-nal functions through natural anguage command and queryinputs.
This use of the DMA model for natural language iwterfaces demonstrates that it is an effective alternative toothernatural language interface schemes.II.
A background of DMAThe Direct Memoly Access method of parsing originated inQuillian~s\[1968\] notion of semantic memory, which was nsedin his TLC (Quillian\[1969\]) which led to further esearch insemantic network-based processing 2.
TLC used breadth-firstspreading marker-passing as an intersection search of two lex-ically pointed nodes in a semantic memory, leaving interpreta-tion of text as an intersection of the paths.
Thus, interpretationof input text was directly performed on semantic memory.
Al-though TLC was the first DMA system, DMA had not beenexplored as a model of parsing until the DMAP0 system ofRiesbeek&Martin, except as a scheme for disambiguations.I)MAP0 used a guided marker-passing algorithm to avoid theproblem of an explosion of search paths, from which a dumb 3(not guided) marker passing mechanism inherently suffers.DMAP0 used P~markers (Prediction markers) and A-markers(Activation markers) as markers passed around in memory,adopting the notion of concept sequence to represent linearordering of concepts as linguistic knowledge, which guideslinear predictions of concepts ending P-markers in memory.ZSueh as Fahhnan\[1979\], Hirst&Charniak\[1982\].

Independent of the se-mantic network of domain knowledge used by the MT sys..tern, the DM-COMMAND has separate memory network reporesenting concepts involved in performing various actions inthe MT system.

Likewise, the direct memory access recognitionof a question means that the concept which is identified by theinput is directly connected to the concept hat represents heanswer, as long as the system knows (or potentially knows)the answer.
In oilier words, in the DMA model, recognition ofa request for action is a triggering of the action requested andrecognition of a question is knowing the answer (i.e., as soonas we understand the question, either we know the answer, orwe know the inferences to be performed (or functions to beevaluated) to get the answer) as long as memory contains theaction and the answer.
'lb reiterate the literature on the DMAparadigm, in this model, memory is organized in the hierarchi-cal network of concepts which are related by links that definethe concepts.
Thus, as soon as we identify the input with acertain concept in the memory, we can trigger the action (ifthis is a concept that represents some action (or request for ac-tion)), or answer the question (if the concept represents someknowledge (or request for some knowledge)).
Thus, parsingand inference are integrated in the memory search process,and no separate inferential modules are necessary.
It shouldbe understood; however, that it is not our claim that we caneliminate inference altogether.
Our claim is that 1) the mem-ory search through concept refinement itself is an inferencewhich is normally performed by separate inference modules-(such as eontexual inference and discourse analyses modules)in other parsing paradigm; and 2) whenever further inferenceis necessary, such inference can be directly triggered afterconcept refinement from the result of parse (for example, as adaemon stored in the abstraction of the refined concept) andtherefore, the inference is integrated in the memory activity.C.
Ellispsis and anaphoraIn a practical natural language interface, the capacity to han-dle elliptic and anaphorie xpressions i important.
DM-COMMAND is capable of handling these phenomena, be-cause under the DMA paradigm (which is typically called"recognize-and-record paradigm"), the result of each parse isnot lost after each sentence, but instead remains as part of thecontexual knowledge in the memory network.
On the otherhand, in the traditional parsing paradigm (we call it "build-and~store" paradigm), since the result of the parse is lost af-ter each sentence, the parsers can at best handle indexicalitywithin a sentence.
Specifically, 1) ellipses are handled byDM-CoMMAND; since ellipses are characterized asthe lack ofelements in a concept sequence, and these are recoverable aslong as the elements or their descendants had been activatedin previous parsesl4; 2) anaphoric and pronoun references are~4For example, with the input "jgt92.gra o uchidase, sem.tst mo."
(Printjgr92.gra.
Sem.tst also).
Second senteuce has the object droped; however,resolved by utilization of both semantic knowledge (repre-.sented as restrictions on possible types of resolutions) andalso by the context left from the previous parses in memorysimilar to the way,that he elliptic expressions am handled.Finding a contexually salient NP corresponding to sotr~e NPmeans, in DMA, searching for a concept in memory whichis previously activated and can be contexually substit~te fox'currently active concept sequencetS oDo DMA and syntaxOne weakness of current implementations of th~ If)MAparadigm is that the concept sequence is the sole syntacticknowledge for parsing 16.
Therefore, a DMA system needsdeliberate preparation of concept sequences tohandle syntac-tically complex sentences ( uch as deeply embedded clauses~small cauls ,  many types of sentential djuncts, etc.).
Thisdoes not mean that it is incapable of handling syntacticallycomplex sentences, instead it means that concept sequencesat some level of abstraction (at syntactic template l vel downto phrasal lexicon (Becker\[1975\]) level) must be prepared foreach type of complex sentence.
In other words, althoughsuch sentences can be handled by the combination of con-cept sequences, designing such sequences can be complex andless general than using external syntactic knowledge 17.
Thus,current reliance upon a linear sequence of concepts causeslimitations on the types of sentences that can be realisticallyhandled in DM-COMMAND.
Of course, there is nothing to pre-vent DMA paradigm to integrate syntactic knowledge othea'than a linear sequence of concepts.
Actually, we have alreadyimplemented two alternative schemes for integrating phrase-structure rules into DMA.
One method we used was havingsyntactic nodes as part of the memory and writing phrase-structure rules as concept sequences 18.
Another method wasto integrate the DMA memory activity into an augnrnentedcontext-free grammar unification i  a generalized LR parsing.Second method used in a continuous speech understandingis described in Tomabeetti&Tomita\[ms\].
We will not discussthese schemes in this paper.While handling syntactically complex sentences i  ratherexpensive for DM-COMMAND, since it relies solely on linearconcept sequences, natural language interfaces are one appli-tiffs can be supplied since the memory activity after the first sentence is ~otlost and the memory can supply the missing object.15Fur example in"Pretty-print dm.lisp.
Send it to mt@.nr'~ "it" can beidentified with the concept inmemory that represents din.lisp which wasactivated inmemory during the understanding of the first sentence.t~Although eneration is normally helped by external syntactic katowl-edge snch as in file case of DM'I'RANS.17Also, pronoun and anaphora resolution is based upon contexual knowl-edge alone; however, use of syntactic knowledge (such as rite governingcategory of an anaphora) would help such efforts.18Due to recursive nature of phrase-strncture r l s, we did not find tiffsmethod appealing, urtiess we obtain atruly parallel machine.664cation area where the capacity to handle phenomena such asellipsis, auaphora, pronoun resolution, and contexual disam-bignation is more valuable than handling syntactically com-plex sentences.
It seems that DMA is one ideal paradigm inthis axeao This is evident if we consider the fact that inputto a natui'al language interface is normally in a form of di-alog and users tend to input short, elliptic, ambiguous audeven ungrammatical sentences to the interface.
Our experi-ence shows that an increase in the size and complexity ofthe system ~n order to integrate full syntaciic processing, en-hancing the DMA's capacity to handle syntactically complexsentences, has so far outweighed the need for such capacity 19.Eo 1V~fip~e ~e~anti~: etworks  and  por tab i l i ty\])M-COMt,.~AND utilizes two types of semantic networks.

The otheras the network of memoxy which is unique to DM-COMMAND.This memory represents a hierarchy of concepts involved incommanding and question-answering necessary for the devel-opment of machine translation systems.
This memory networkis written with generic concepts for development of MT sys-tems, so that this memory we have developed at CMT shouldbe portable to other systems 2?.The control mechanism (i.e., spreading activation guidedmarker-passing algorithm) and the actual functions for per-forming actions are separate (actu',d functions ale integratediuto the \]D~/~-COMMAND memory network).
This separationmakes the system highly portable, first because virtually nochange is necessary in the control mecharfism for iranspoltingto other systems, and second because the size of the wholesystem can be trimmed or expanded according to the ma-chine's aw61able virtual memory space simply by changingthe size of the DM-COMMAND memory network 21.Thus, ~mder DMA, a natural anguage interface can 1)directly spr,~ad markers on the target system's already ex-isting semautic network 22, utilizing the existing knowledge19Although, we have seen that it is effective in parsing noisy continuoussl)eech input (Tomabechi&Tomita\[ms\]).~Of conrse~ we will need to change the specific functions that are storedin some of the nodes and perhaps some of the specific (lower in the hier-archy) concepls need to be modified for each specific system.21if only a l)asic command natural language interface is required, thenwe can trim |h,~ pints of memory used for adwmced interface and question-answering.
(h~ the other hand, if machine's memory is of no concern, wecan write memory-net and concept-sequences fbr all the system functions ofltie tin'get MT .,;ystem.
Also, note thai due to the spreading activation guidedmal'ker..passing algorifllm of the DM-CoMMAND recognizer, the speed ofthe system isndnimally affected by an increase inthe size of the memory forcommanding and qnestion-mlswering.
It is because spreading activation islocal to each concept and its packaged nodes under guided marker-passingthat even if the size of the whole memory network increased, the amountof computation for each concept should not inerea~ accordingly.~-:'~As long ~L~ semantic nets are implemented in a general frame languageor object oriented systems.for understanding input texts!
2) utilize a command andquery conceptual network developed elsewhere (such as DM-COMMAND), with minimum ~todifications in the functionsstored in the root nodes that ~h-igger the actions; 3) be portedto different systems with virtually no change in the controlmechanism since it is a guided spreading activation marker-passing mechanism and no system specific functions are in-eluded (those functions are included in the comand/query se-mantic net).V.
ConclusionDM-.COMMAND is the first practical application of the DMAparadigm of natural anguage understanding, in which pars-ing and memory-based inference is integrated.
This systemhas been proven to be highly effective in knowledge-basedMT development.
It is due to the complexity of system im-plementations in a large scale MT project that grammar andknowledge base writers axe not expected to have expertise outhe internals of the translation system, whereas it is necessaryfor such a group of project members to access the system in-ternal functions.
DM-COMMAND makes this access possiblethrough a natural language command and question answeringinterface.
Since DM-COMMAND uses the spreading activa-tion guided marker-passing algorithm, in a memory accessparser which directly accesses the MT system's already exist~ing network of concepts, inference is integrated into memoryactivity.
Since there is a separate memory network for con-cepts representing commanding and question-answering thatare generic to MT system development, the system is highlyportable.
The DM-COMMAND system demonstrates the powerof a direct memory access paradigm as a model for a natu-ral language interface, since understanding in this model is al'ecognition of the input sentence with the existing knowledgein memory, and as soon as such understanding is done, thedesired command can be directly triggered (or the questiondirectly answered).With DMA's ability to handle xtra-sentential phenomena(including ellipsis, anaphora, pronoun reference, and word-sense ambiguity), which are typical in a practical natural lan-guage commaud/query inputs, DMA is one ideal paradigm fornatural anguage interfaces as shown in our DM-COMMANDsystem.
Also, DMA's integration of parsing and inference intoan unified semantic memory search has proven to be highlyeffective in this application.Appendix: Implementationql~e DM-COMMAND system has been implemented on theIBM-RT ~3 and HP9000 AI workstations, both running23Due to the space limitation, the actual sample output of the system isnot included in this proceedings paper.
