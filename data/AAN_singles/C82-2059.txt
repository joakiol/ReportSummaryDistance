,  Shanghai,  ChinaThere are.
already a variety of Chinese Language ProcessingSystems commercially available around the world, of which themain d ivergence  i s  probably  in  the input  approaches of  Chinesecharacters .
But due to  the fo l low ing  two fac ts  none of thecur rent  approaches could be taken fo r  an un iversa l ly  acknowledg-ed scheme, the f i r s t  fac t  i s  that  the to ta l  number of  Chinesecharacters  i s  immense and the second and perhaps more c r i t i ca lfac t  i s  the topo log ica l  s t ruc tures  of  Chinese characters  arera ther  soph is t i ca ted .Cons ider ing  that  Chinese Phonet ic  Alphabet (CPA) i s  ga in -ing on Chinese pup i l s  and s tudents  ( inc lud ing  fo re ign  s tudentss tudy ing  in  Chins)e Cons ider ing  a l so  that  CPA i s  supposed to beused as an in ternat iona l  t ranscr ip t ion  fo r  Chinese characters ,the author  has proposed a new input  approach to input  Chineselanguage to a computer in  the l ight  of AI theory  and pract i cewith i t s  p ro to type  Jus t  be ing implement on a microcomputersystem in our laboratories.
This new Chinese Input System willsex~e as one of the subsystems of a comprehensive ChineseLanguage Computer-Aided Instruction System for teaching foreigns tudents  oh ot~ campus - the HUAHAN system.Working with our Chinese Input  System people can inputChinese text  by typ ing  the cor respond ing  phonet ic  symbols ofeach Chinese word through an ord inary  keyboard.
Eventua l ly  theoriginal Chlnes% text will be obtained on the Chinese ORT screenor on the harcopy through Chinese pr in ter .- 240 -The bot t leneck  of th i s  kind of approaches i s  genera l lya t t r ibuted  to the la rge  and in reasonab le  amount of homophonesin Chinese language.
As a matter of fact, a siDgle Chineseword may consist of more than one characters.
In CPA a multi--character word i s  o f ten  represented  as one un i t .
For ins tance ,in phonetic system the string "xingshi" is a word which ksformed out of two Chinese characters ,  i .
e .
the character"zing" and the character  "shi".
Some individual Chinese charact -e rs ,  such as "xing" and "shi", may also be a word, hence theymay have one or more homophones.
Furthermore,  mu l t i - characterword i8 s t i l l  sub jec t  to homophone, i .e .
phonet ic  symbol"x ingsh i "  represents  both the Chinese words "s i tuat ion"  and" form",  among others ,  though the number of homophones i s  muchreduced.The key to the quest ion  ks the sof tware  of th i s  ChineseInput System which must be developed as to ident i fy  d i f fe rentChinese words proper ly  on the bas is  of the same phonet ics~mbol, i .
e .
,  d i f fe rent  s t r ing  of Chinese oharacters  must begenerated  from the same phonet ic  symbol occur ing  in  d i f fe rentcontexts .We argue that  the d i f fe rent ia t ion  of  the homophones couldbe rea l i zed  in  the s imi la r  as in  the d i ssmblguat ion  of  the sameword occur ing in  d i f fe rent  contexts  in  Natura l  Language Under-standing (NLU) which is making rapid progress.When considered as without any connection with other wordsa Chinese word with one or more homophones sharing the samephonet ic  symbol i s  rea l ly  a t roub le ,  but when we t ry  to  graspthe proper  word not mere ly  by i t se l f  but in  connect ion  w i thi t s  context  wi th the background knowledgy and/or  wi th  the verytop ics  of  the whole text  or cor respond ing  paragraph,  we f ind ,as a ru le ,  the phonet ic  ambigui ty  ( i .e .
the d i f fe rent  homophoneswhich cause language ambigu i t ies )  would d i sso lve .
So the mostimportant i s  to  ext rac t  the above-mentioned l ingu is t i c  concept -uat ions  as Chinese text  input  i s  going on.- 241  -To th i s  end our  sys tem i s  d iv ided  in to  four  subsystemsincluding the following=Lex ica l  ana lyzerContext  ana lyzerIn fe rence  mechan ismKnowledge/concept / top ic  baseThe lex ica l  ana lyzer  separates  the  words  wh ich  have  oneor  more mohophones  f rom those  w i thout  homophones .The context  ana lyzer  t r ies  to  ext rac t  the  contextua lmean ing  and/or  the  top ic  o f  the  text  o r  the  paragraph where inthe  word occurs  by ana lyz ing  the  context .The in ference  mechan ism draws ,  when necessary ,  in fe rencesf rom the  contextua l  mean ing  in  o rder  to  obta in  proper  concepto f  the  t roub lesome phonet ic  symbo ls  so as  to  get  the  properChinese words  consequent ly .The knowledge/coD~ept / top ie  base  per fo rms as  a dr iver  fo rthe  who le  sys tem,  by communicat ing  w i th  each  o f  the  o therthree subsystems in gathering processed results from one sub-sys tem as  input  data  to  the  o ther  and prov id ing  them wi thadditional material necessary for further pocessing.Thus people can easily see that what our system reallydoes is essentially a Chinese Language Understandin E Systemtries to do.
But what our system features as compared withother  NLU sys tems i s  that  we t r ied  hard  to  deve lop  i t  to  makesure  that  the  knowledge/concept / top ic  base  and the  three  o thersubsystems operate  concur rent ly ,  re f lec t ing  our  not ion  o f  theactual process of human language understanding.Conventionally Chinese Language Processing is involved inthe area of Computer Science.
In working up our system wehave benefited a lot from theories and practices in Computat-ional Linguistics and advanced researches in AI, especiallythose research activities at University of Pennsylvania (underdirection of Prof. A.K.Joshi) and at Yale University (underdirection of Prof. R.C.Schank), all of which bear a stronglinguistic flavor.- 242 -As a resu l t ,  the author  i s  inc l ined  to s~est  a newin terd isc ip l inary  research  f ie ld  be put forward which i stentat ive ly  termed as L ingu is t i c  Eng ineer ing .
O-ur work i staken as a humble s ta r t  of  i t s  p rac t i ce .Now the implementat ion  of  the system i s  Jumt going onw i th  a pro to type .
To our spec ia l  purpose the BASIC d ia lec tsof  our CROW~I~CO and CBSEC microcomputers are  extended by theauthor  in  o rder  to  invo lve  some LISP features  which wouldmeet the needs to implement such a heavy l ingu is t i c  systemon a microcomputer .- 243  -
