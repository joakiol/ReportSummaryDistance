Signition Inc.A Preprocessor for Speech Recognition Systems Operating in NoisyEnvironmentsPrincipal Investigator: Dr. George Zweig;Objectives:The recognition of speech in noisy environments is critical to certain DoDsystems now under development.
Current preprocessors for speechrecognition systems, such as those based on "linear predictive coding," arelinear and therefore not effective in noisy environments.
The objective of thisproject is to develop a nonlinear preprocessor for speech recognition systemsthat significantly improves the signal to noise ratio of the speech signal to berecognized.
The nonlinear transmission line will be realized in software,although realization in hardware in FY91 should be possible.
More specificallywe will:1) Develop a nonlinear transmission line preprocessor that accuratelysimulates the mechanics of the inner ear at all sound pressure levels.2) Preprocess peech with the nonlinear transmission line and show that thereis a substantial improvement in the signal to noise ratio.3) Assess the desirability and feasibility of creating either a digital oranalogue transmission line on a chip and using it as a preprocessor in theCMU, BBN, or MIT DARPA funded speech recognition systems.Principles of nonlinear signal processing found in hearing may also beabstracted from their biological context and applied to the analysis of oceanacoustic and seismic signals.Recent accomplishments:A linear transmission line model of the inner ear was developed and used to"preprocess" speech recorded in a quiet environment.
The output of this linemakes the resonant modes of the vocal tract and the temporal waveform of itsglottal excitation function apparent.Work planned for FY89:Nonlinear mechanisms found in the mechanics of hearing will be investigatedand incorporated into the transmission line preprocessor.229
