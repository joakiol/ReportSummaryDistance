We discuss theseconcepts and the way they areimplemented in the architecturalframework of the ADAM corpus,which is a corpus of 450 Italian spon-taneous dialogues.
The design ofADAM architecture is compatiblewith as many practices of dialogueannotation as possible, as well as ap-proaches to annotation at differentlevels.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper we describe the methodologicalassumptions and general architectural frame-work underlying the ADAM Corpus, whichis currently being developed as part of theItalian national project SI-TAL (Autori vari,2000) 1.
Annotated ialogue corpora are ofcrucial importance for the development of vo-cal applications.
Because of their cost, how-ever, it is essential that their acquisition andannotation be designed in order to maximizetheir reusability as much as possible.
Themain assumption behind the design of theADAM corpus is that actual reusability ofcorpora cruciMly depends on the strategicchoices concerning the architectural design ofthe corpus, i.e.
the way in which annotationtThe final version of the ADAM Corpus will bereleased by the end of 2001.
A pilot set, consisting of30 dialogues, i  currently available.is organized and structured, and the way inwhich this is represented in a given physicalformat 2.
Corpus reusability is traditionallyseen as mainly a by-product of either corpusrepresentativeness anddegree of standardiza-tion of annotation schemes.
We claim thattwo other requirements should be taken intoaccount when designing and building an anno-tated corpus that aims at reusability, namelymodularity of annotation, and use of annota-tion meta-schemes.
The meaning of these no-tions, as well as the way in which they arerealized by the ADAM Corpus will be de-scribed in detail throughout the paper.
Sec-tion 2 introduces the corpus; section 3 focuseson ADAM: the motivations underlying its ar-chitecture are presented and the adoption ofXML as mark-up language is discussed.
Fi-nally, the various annotation schemes are il-lustrated in section 4.2 Corpus  Descr ip t ionThe ADAM Corpus, which is currently be-ing developed, will consist of 450 Italiandialogues, both human-human and human-machine, belonging to the tourist domain.The human-machine component of the corpusis represented by human-machine dialoguesover the phone, which are recordings of ac-tual interactions occurring between customersand the Italian national railway informationsystem (FS-Informa, (Bahia et al, 2000)).The human-human component is representedby task-oriented dialogues between a personplaying the role of a travel agent and anotherplaying the role of a customer.
Each dia-logue in the corpus is represented by an or-2For a similar view see (Ide and Brew, 2000).9thographic transcription, recording the wordsuttered by the speakers plus any other nonlinguistic sound.
The transcription is linkedto an audio file in PCM format.
In addi-tion, each dialogue is annotated according tofive annotation levels, namely prosody, mor-phosyntax, syntax, semantics and pragmatics(see below).3 ADAM:  Arch i tec tura l  P r inc ip les3.1 Reusabi l i ty  Requ i rementsThe ADAM approach is mainly driven by theneed of meeting the requirements of poten-tial users of annotated corpora, with a par-ticular emphasis on corpora reusability.
Anannotated corpus is reusable as far as it com-plies with several requirements, such as cor-pus representativeness and use of standard-ized annotation schemes (see some widelyrenoWned standardization efforts uch as EA-GLES, MATE, DRI, ATLAS, etc.).
Thephysical format or mark-up language for cor-pus encoding is another crucial issue, as itwill be argued in section 3.4.
In addition tothis, we claim that an annotated corpus isuseful beyond the immediate particular ap-plication aims only to the extent o which itis designed so as to meet two other importantneeds.
A fundamental requirement appearsto revolve around the way annotation is orga-nized, structured and represented in a corpus.In short, it is essential that the annotation,i.e.
the linguistic information added to thedata, should be easily and quickly modifiableat a moderately ow cost by subsequent usersof the corpus.
We can think of at least twopossible scenarios, referring to two orthogo-nal dimensions of customization operations.First, it might be the case that a user wishesto reuse a corpus which is annotated for sev-eral types of linguistic information, but lacksof a particular annotation type; the poten-tial user could nevertheless be interested inthe existing annotations, and would like tosupplement them with a new one.
On theother hand, it might be the case that a useris interested in some annotation only (e.g.,pos-tagging or syntactic structure) and s/hemight want to leave aside other annotationtypes.
Reusability of an annotated corpuscan thus be thought of as a function of theextent o which new levels of linguistic infor-mation can be added, or uninteresting onescan be removed.
This is what we call the ver-tical dimension of customization i annotatedcorpora.
Second, for each level of linguisticanalysis, an annotated corpus is likely to bereused depending on the extent o which ex-isting annotation can be changed, so as to ac-commodate different annotation practices.
Itis often the case that a corpus which is anno-tated with a given annotation scheme "hard-wires" the annotation so as it is impossibleto replace the annotation without revertingto the raw text and rebuilding the annotationfrom scratch, which is enormously expensive.This is what we call the horizontal dimensionoff customization of an annoted corpus.The extent to which an annotated corpuscan be compliant with these two requirementsclearly depends on the architectural choicesmade at the design level: if, for instance, alltypes of annotation are flattened onto a singlerepresentation level, it is clear that the cus-tomizing operations above become hardly fea-sible.
We claim that the vertical and horizon-tal customization requirements can be easilyachieved on the one hand by appealing to thetwo related notions of modularity of annota-tion and use of annotation meta-schemes, andon the other by exploiting a physical formatof encoding that fully supports them.
In thenext three sections we illustrate the two con-cepts as well as the way they are implementedin the ADAM Corpus.3.2 Annotation ModularityIn an annotated corpus, several differenttypes of annotation or linguistic informationmay be present in relation to the same in-put data.
These types of information can bethought of as independent, yet related, levelsor dimensions of linguistic description .
Wethus can think of a level of prosodic analy-sis, another of pos-tagging, another of seman-tic analysis, etc.
By annotat ion  modular -i ty  we mean that the different layers of an-10notation are to be kept independent one ofanother.
In the ADAM Corpus we providefive layers of annotation: prosodic, morpho-syntactic (pos tagging), syntactic, conceptual-semantic, and pragmatic.
Each dialogue inthe corpus is annotated at the above five lev-els of analysis; synchronization among the dif-ferent analyses and between these and thespeech signal is ensured by the different anno-tations (stored as separate files) making ref-erence to the same input file.
This file, con-taining the transcription ofthe dialogue, is inturn linked to the audio file in PCM (a-lowor u-low) format.
As it will be argued in sec-tion 3.3, support for this structure isprovidedby the use of XML as mark-up language.
Byadopting this structure, annotation layers arelinguistically heterogeneous and mutually or-thogonal, so that changing one of them af-fects others only to a limited extent; layersare nevertheless indirectly related through a)their hinging on a common reference file (the"raw" text represented by the transcriptionfile); b) the indirect correlation of the lin-guistic information they convey.
This verti-cal modularity of the ADAM approach hasinteresting consequences for the purposes ofreusability.
A potential user of the ADAMCorpus is left free to select, among the pro-posed levels of annotation, those which bestreflect his/her theoretical nd practical inter-ests.
(S)he can also feel the need for addinga new layer of information, ot contemplatedin today's ADAM realization.
By the way,level modularity is also of theoretical inter-est, since most annotation schemes we knowdiffer mainly in the way pieces of linguistic in-formation categorized, rather than in the in-trinsic nature of these levels.
Moreover, levelmodularity seems to have a useful impact onour theoretical understanding of the linguisticphenomena at stake, since it is capable of ex-pressing correlations between layers, and ulti-mately between dimensions of linguistic anal-ysis.3.3 Annotat ion meta-schemesHorizontal customization i annotated cor-pora can be enhanced by implementing theconcept of annotation meta-schemes.
Thedifferent layers of linguistic description ira-pried by the concept of annotation modular-ity presuppose as many annotation schemes.As it will be made clear in section 4, foreach of the five annotation layers envisagedfor the ADAM Corpus, a particular annota-tion scheme has been designed and applied.However, it should be emphasized how theADAM specifications do not merely amountto another set of ready-made, off-the-shelf an-notation schemes.
Rather, we would like tofocus the attention on what we call an an-notation meta-scheme, and on the implica-tions of this choice.
According to our view,an annotation meta-scheme is a general de-scriptive framework in which different annota-tion schemes can be accommodated.
In manycases the same unit of linguistic informationcan be annotated in different, arguably mutu-ally incompatible ways, which are nonethelessall compatible with the recommended verticalmodularity described above: so it is betterto provide the potential user with the pos-sibility of adopting any arbitrary annotationscheme without being forced to re-build theannotation from scratch or to forcefully com-ply with some other annotation scheme, nomatter how standardized.
To do so, it is nec-essary to have a representation format for theannotation that is general enough for com-peting schemes to be mutually substitutable.In ADAM we achieve this aim by buildinga general scheme where those features thatare common to several competing schemes be-come slots or descriptive lement ags to beassociated with linguistic elements; the val-ues of these attributes can be any arbitraryset of tags.
Let's consider, for instance, thecase of pragmatic annotation.
The main dif-ference between annotation schemes for thislevel of analysis lies in the particular types ofdialogue act chosen rather than in the notionof dialogue act itself, which appears to be un-controversial.
If, however, we adopt a schemewhere the basic descriptive element of any ar-bitrarily long set of words is the general tag<dialogue act>, further described by an at-tribute type, different schemes can be applied11to the same corpus without totally discardingthe existing annotation: a substitution i  theset of values will be enough.
It is our beliefthat enforcing this practice in the design ofannotation schemes will bring us to more ef-fective corpora exchange and reuse 33.4 XML-based  Annotat ionIn fact, actual corpus reusability also cru-cially depends on the physical \]ormat or mark-up language used for corpus encoding.
Themark-up language used for the ,encoding of theADAM Corpus is XML.
XML proved to bethe ideal candidate for a number of reasons,all related to corpus reusability.
First, it isan emerging and widespread standard, whichensures a good degree of corpus reusabilityin the times to come.
Second, because ofits platform-independence it enhances the po-tential for wide circulation of the annotatedmaterial, together with a considerable flexi-bility of use.
More crucially, however, XMLproved essential for implementation f the ar-chitectural choices described above.
Anno-tation modularity is supported via extensiveuse of Xlink elements (DeRose et al, 2000).Each XML element in the annotation files isactually an hypertextual link which refers toan element (or set of elements) in the tran-scription file.
All annotations for each di-alogue are thus connected to the same in-put reference source (the transcription), thusensuring synchronization of the different an-notations and still preserving their indepen-dence.
On the other hand, the concept ofannotation meta-scheme is implemented bymaking the XML translation of the differentannotation schemes content-independent.
Inother words, a general preference was giventowards representing the different ~nnotationtags as values of generic, scheme-independentattributes of XML elements.
In this way thedifferent annotation schemes (represented asdifferent DTDs) are represented in a genericenough way, so that a future user of the cor-pus will only need to change the values ofSin addition, the meta-scheme can be seen as atool for effective compariso n of alternative annotationschemes.the different attributes for the entire annota-tion scheme to be changed.
We believe thatthis approach represents a further value of theADAM Corpus.3.5 Prev ious  and re lated workOur work builds on some important standard-ization efforts which were going on during thepast few years in the field of dialogue an-notation (DRI, EAGLES, and MATE).
Weare also indebted to the experience gainedin other projects using stand-off XML an-notation, and in particular to the MATEproject.
The multi-level markup frameworkadopted in ADAM closely reflects the MATEapproach (Dybkjaer et al, 1998).
In addi-tion, in our project we are using the MATEworkbench (Dybkjaer and Bernsen, 2000) forvisualization and information extraction pur-poses.
However, at the best of our knowl-edge ADAM is the first corpus being archi-tecturally designed by explicitly adopting theconcept of annotation modularity and meta-scheme at different levels.
A recent standard-ization project in the annotation field is con-stituted by the ATLAS (Bird et al, 2000) con-sortium, including NIST, LDC and MITRE.The ATLAS architecture is based on a formalmodel for annotating linguistic data (Birdand Liberman, 1999).
ATLAS offers a three-layers solution to the problem of integratingdifferent data storage formats by providinga logical level which consists of the languageformalism and the API.
The architecture weare proposing for the ADAM corpus is nota software architecture such as the one im-plemented by ATLAS.
While the latter onemeets the requirement of flexible and dynamicextension of the sofware modules, the ADAMarchitecture mainly refers to functional orga-nization of the different annotation layers.
InADAM the flexibility requirement is aboutthe possible xtensions of those layers.
In ad-dition, the ATLAS architecture covers a largevariety of possibly annotated ata (not onlylinguistic data, but visual data of differentkinds too), while ADAM is only focused onlinguistic and speech annotations.124 Leve ls  o f  Annotat ionThe ADAM's five levels of annotation weremainly chosen in consideration of their inter-est for practical applications of the annotatedmaterial.
In spite of the number of levels con-sidered, and their sometimes conflicting re-quirements, we tried to develop a coherent,unitary approach to design and applicationof annotation schemes.
In particular, in de-veloping the different annotation schemes forthe five levels envisaged, attention was paidto be consistent with criteria of robustness,wide coverage and compliance with existingstandards.4.1 The prosodic  levelFor the annotation of the prosodic phenomenaof dialogue we are adopting the meta-schemefor prosody annotation developed by Quazzaand Garrido (Klein et al, 1998) within theMATE project.
This meta-scheme allows toannotate the prosodic phenomena of naturaldialogue by distinguishing the following foursub-levels of prosodic annotation:?
phonetic transcription?
phonetic representation f intonation?
phonological representation f intonation?
prosodic phrasingThe four levels do not represent a fixed hi-erarchy.
The two phonetic levels are directlyaligned with the speech signal and in thissense may be considered as base levels.
Thetwo phonological levels keep a natural rela-tionship both with the base prosodic levelsand with other linguistic units.
In the actualuse of the scheme, the levels and their linkscan be fully or partially specified.
In a lin-guistic text-oriented analysis, prosody couldbe considered in its function, leaving out thedetails of its realization.
In this case, the solephonological levels may be filled and linkedto the orthographic level of words.
Com-plex schemes like ToBI could be used in thisway, or simpler schemes providing labels todistinguish types of accents, associated withwords, and types of intonation boundaries.
Ina speech technology context, a more signal-oriented approach could be adopted.
In or-der to recognize or synthesize prosodic pat-terns, detailed phonetic descriptions are nec-essary, requiring both phonetic segmentationand phonetic representation f intonation - interms of pitch movements or target f0 levels.The ADAM prosodic annotation is done atthe level of the prosodic phrasing.
The thirdsection of Appendix B reports an excerptof the prosodic annotation file of a human-human dialogue of the corpus.
These are fourdialogue turns whose text is translated in thefirst section of the Appendix.
The elementbreakindex allows to encode the ToBI labelswhich constitute the values of the attributetype.
For example, the brkndx_O07 is an-notated with type label 3p to mark-up anhesitation pause.4.2 The Morpho~Syntact ic  andSyntact ic  LevelsThe ADAM proposal for the morphosyntac-tic level is a two-layer annotation structure,containing respectively information on wordcategory and morphosyntactic features (postagging), and non recursive phrasal nuclei(called chunks).
Robustness and coveragewere a crucial aspect in the development ofthe two schemes, in particular for what con-cerns i) syntactic onstructions specific of spo-ken dialogues (ellipses, anacolutha, non ver-bal predicative sentences etc.
), and ii) dis-fluencies (repetitions, false starts, trailing offetc.).
The morphosyntactic annotation levelencodes the following information: a) iden-tification of morphological words and linkingto their corresponding orthographic ounter-parts; b) annotation of their pos-category; c)annotation of morphosyntactic features (suchas number, gender, person, tense, etc.
); d) an-notation of their corresponding lemma.
Thepartic~ar tag set, though adapted to repre-sentation of Italian, is compliant with EA-GLES recommendations (Gibbon, 1999).
Inaddition, the tag set is structured into a corescheme, supplying basic means for annotatingmorphological information, and a peripherytag set, which serves the purpose of making13provision for further linguistic annotation tobe added to obligatory information.
The syn-tactic annotation level is built on top of theprevious one and consists in identification ofnon-recursive phrasal nuclei (called chunks)and annotation of their category (Mengel etal., 1999).
The preference given to shallowparsing over, e.g., phrase structure trees ischiefly motivated by the locality of the anal-ysis offered by this approach, a useful featureif one wants to prevent a local parsing failurefrom backfiring and causing the entire parseof an utterance to fail.
This is particularlydesirable when dealing with particularly noisyand fragmented input such as spoken dialoguetranscripts.
For an illustration of morphosyn-tactic and syntactic annotation, see examples4 and 5 in Appendix B.4.3 The Conceptua l  LevelThe annotation scheme for the conceptuallevel has been designed on the following re-quirements and assumptions:?
portabi l i ty :  although most of conceptsencode strictly domain-dependent i for-mation, the annotation scheme should bedomain-independent as much as possible;?
expressiveness:  the scheme should al-low the representation of the content ofcomplex dialogues;?
minimal i ty:  a turn should be annotatedin a unique way;?
simplicity: the syntactical complexityof the concept is to be minlmized;?
locality: the annotation should not takein account he history of the dialogue.The proposed annotation scheme takes inspi-ration from the so called "Frame-based De-scription Languages" (Cattoni and Franconi,1990), a well established framework in thefield of the Knowledge Representation.
Inour annotation scheme a concept is encodedlike a "frame", a typed structure with "slots".Slots represent the properties of the conceptand its relations with Other concepts.
Slotsare encoded with the couple <slot-name, slot-value>: the former contains the name of aproperty, the latter either a simple value ora reference to another concept.
This recur-sion allows the encoding of complex and struc-tured semantics information.
Concepts aretyped: different ypes of concepts (e.g.
"trip","room") encode different contents to be rep-resented.For example given the sentence to be an-notated "the train leaves from rome at eigtho'clock of monday fifteen", its conceptual an-notation is:<concept id="c_O01" ctype="trip"><slot shame= "transport at ion-t ype"svalue =" train"/><slot sname="origin" svalue="rome"/><slot sname="departure-time" svalue="*c_O02"/></concept><concept id="c_O02" ctype="time"><slot sname="hour" svalue="8:00"/><slot sname="week-day" svalue="monday"/><slot sname="month-day " svalue="md15"/></concept>where the concept c_001 of type triphas tre slots; the slot representing thedeparture- t ime encodes a reference (intro-duced by the character '*') to the other con-cept c_002 of type time.The annotation scheme is domain indepen-den/: the tag set does not change when thedomain changes ince the domain-dependentinformation is encoded in the values of theattributes.
The user is free to adopt the pre-ferred ontology, although a good reference arethe symbols adopted by the C-STAR consor-tium (Waibel, 1996) for the inter-lingua: theyhave been developed on the basis of the ex-perience on six different (Asiatic and Euro-pean) languages and this appears to guaran-tee a good portability inter-lingua.4.4 The Pragmat ic  LevelFor annotating the pragmatic level of dia-logue, we base our work on the concept ofdialogue act.
Informally speaking, a dia-logue act tag is a label belonging to a tagset which refers to a given iUocutionary di-mension that may be performed by utteringa sentence.
A dialogue utterance may be an-notated with a dialogue act label for repre-senting the discourse function it plays in the14dialogue.
The annotation scheme used for thepragmatic level of the ADAM corpus is anextension of both DAMSL (Core and Allen,1997) and SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL (Juraf-sky et al, 1997).
The extension was not mo-tivated by domain, rather by the dependencyon the dialogue type.
Actually, most of dia-logue acts encode information that is strictlydependent on whether the communication istask-oriented, familiar, formal, and so on.
Sothe inventory of dialogue acts labei should besufficiently wide to cover different types of di-alogues, and sufficiently open to add new dia-logue act labels for different annotation tasks.For the design of the extended tag set we haveidentified the following requirements and as-sumptious:?
m in ima l i ty :  an utterance should betagged with an unique dialogue act label;?
context-sensit iveness: each turn ismanaged by considering the previousturns, that is the annotation should takeinto account he history of the dialogue.The tag set used in the corpus is reported inTable 1 (see the Appendix).
In Appendix B,Section 7 the four dialogue turns translated atthe beginning of the Appendix are annotatedby using the ADAM pragmatic tag set.
Eachdialogue turn is annotated as a whole by tag-ging the communicative level of the turn itself(if it is about the task or about managing thetask, for example).
Within the turn the differ-ent communicative intentions are labeled onthe basis of the dialogue act tag set.5 Conc lus ionsIn this paper we have identified two ba-sic requirements for achieving actual cor-pora reusability, namely annotation modu-larity and use of annotation meta-schemes ,and described how they are addressed in theADAM Corpus.
We claim that, for effectivecirculation and re-use of corpora, it is essen-tial to make provision for as many practicesof dialogue annotation as possible, as well asapproaches to annotation at different levels,instead of providing fixed levels and schemesof analysis, no matter how standardized.
Cor-pora will have a chance to be reused as far asit will be easy and relatively inexpensive toadapt hem to different needs and applicationpurposes.
Use of XML as mark-up languageis a further step toward this end.Re ferencesAutori Vari 2000.
