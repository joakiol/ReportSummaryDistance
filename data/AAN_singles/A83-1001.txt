BRIEF SUMMARIES\[CIN\]:A robust ~ data base interface hasbeen described.
The system consists of twoparts:a natural Language processor forbuilding a formal representation and anapplication program for building a query in anaugmented relational algebra.
Portability isachieved by providing (i) definitions of newconcepts for the NL processor and ( i l )  theconnection between the relations in the database and ~ processor concepts.\[GHF\]:A robust  por tab le  NL in ter face  isdaecr ibad ,  the  por tab i l i ty  eva luced  withrespect  to two app l i ca t ion  domains .

TB conclude that robust ~ systemsdo not exist and provide some guidelines forthe des ign  of such systems.\ [TT\] :The NL in ter face(ASK)  i s  meant for  auser  who wants to c reate ,  tes t  change,augment, and, of course, use her /h i s  knowledgebase.
The user interface is a limited subsetof English.
Fast response time is a majorgoal.
Transportability is achieved via adialogue in ASK which drives the Bulk DataInput Capability.

SOME QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\[.
Al l  authors  have dea l t  w i th  the i ssueof domain independence, an impor tant  aspect  ofpor tab i l i ty  and robustness .
The main s t ra tegyfo r  ach iev ing  th i s  behavtour  i s  to fac tor  thesystem in to  two par ts ,  one based on domainindependent  knowledge and the ocher  on thedomain dependent knowledge.
At leas t  twosystems\[GRO and I'T\] talk about Interactivelyacquiring the \[nformaCion needed foradaptation.
GRO and TT should discuss thes imi la r i t ies  and d i f fe rences  in  the i rapproaches  to acqu is i t ion .2.
GIN uses  the pre ference  in fo rmat ionin the data  base connect ion  par t  of h i s  systemto induce coerc ions(e .g .
,  "a doctor  w i th in  200miles" meaning "a ship wlth a doctor on itwithin 200 miles).
GRO in TEAM achieves the~ame effect by inference rules.
~t is nocclear Just what the difference is betweenGRO's approach and GEN"s approach, i.e.,between inducing coercions and making theinferences.
GRO nad GiN should discuss therealtive merits of their approaches.3.
The domain information schema of GHFspecify the correspondence between informationstructures as chef appear in the text and thevarious internal representaclons ofi n fo rmat ion  in the system.
The systemdescribed by GHF is the only one in thissession which derives ice domain dependentknowledge from the texts Instead of domainexpects.
GHJ should discuss how successful~he 7 are with thls approach.
Also perhapsthe 7 should discuss how their repreeenCatlonscompare with those In TEAM\[GROI.4.
T~ have reviewed the hlecory of EUFZDand ended up on a negative note.
They feelrobust systems do not really exlsC yet.
Sincea\[l the other authors have described "robust"systems, perhaps TB should discuss theirconclusions in some de,all and comment on ChLclaims of these authors.5.
TT have empahsized the speed ofresponse  as a major  feature  of the i r  sys tem.What are  the t rade-o i l s  between speed and themodu lar i ty  of the des ign  ?
TT shou ld  commenton th i s  aspect  as wa l l  as ocher  re la tedaspects  due co the i r  concern  fo r  b r ing ing  upthe system on a desktop  computer .6.
Most of the i ssues  d i scussed  by GT inthe f i r s t  four  sect ions  of the i r  paper  per ta inco making formal  query language(FL) iucer facesa l so  por tab le .
~n fac t ,  many of the i ssuesabout  por tab i l i ty  chat  the o ther  authors  haveaddressed  co are  a l so  re la ted  co FLinterfaces.
It would be very useful ifsoma(or all) of the authors discuss somespec i f i c  problems about  por tab i l i ty  chat  arespecial to NL interfaces in contrast to PLinterfaces.Does the need for having flexible and9ortable interfaces for data bases necessarilyforce us towards NL interfaces ?
Ne hope so !Perhaps, some of the authors will comment onChls issue.
Their specific experience withchelr own systems would be very relevant here.7.
A quesClon chaC is worth discussing byall the authors is whether portability androbustness can be helped if the design of thedata base itself is decemined by theconsideration chat an NL Interface will behooked to IC ?
