The strings havebounded but refinable granularity, suit-able for analyzing (im)perfectivity, dura-tivity, telicity, and various relations includ-ing branching.1 IntroductionA sentence in the simple past, such as (1a), ut-tered at (speech) time S can be pictured as a time-line (1b), describing an event E (Ernest explain-ing) prior to S.(1) a. Ernest explained.b.

S. By contrast, inthe timeline (2a) for the progressive (2b), E splitsinto three boxes, the middle of which contains alsoa reference time R (Reichenbach, 1947).1(2) a. E E,R E (depicting R @ E)b. Ernest explainingThe relation of R inside E, R @ E, breaks Eapart, moving us away from conceptualizing E asa point.
Indeed, it has become common practicein linguistic semantics since (Bennett and Partee,1972) to evaluate temporal formulas at intervals,rather than simply points.
Interval temporal logicsare, however, notoriously more complex than or-dinary (pointwise) temporal logics (Halpern andShoham, 1991; Marcinkowski and Michaliszyn,1Boxes are drawn instead of the usual curly braces {, }around the elements of a set to reinforce a reading of (1b) and(2a) as comic strips, with time standing still within a box, butbetween boxes, progressing from left to right.2013).
That said, for linguistic applications totense and aspect, the present paper derives stringssuch as (1b) and (2a) from timelines for intervaltemporal logic, in effect reducing these timelinesto finite models of ordinary temporal logic.
Thisreduction rests on certain assumptions that requireexplanation and defense.We begin with temporal formulas, which for thesake of brevity, we hereafter call fluents.
A fluentsuch as E, R or S can occur as a whole, as E andS do in (1b), or as segmented, as E does in (2a).We formulate the notions of whole and segmentedmodel-theoretically in section 2, defining a map?

(Bach, 1986a).
The aspectual classification towhich the whole/segmented contrast pertains isthat of perfectives and imperfectiveswholesegmented?perfectiveimperfectiveas opposed to Aktionsart.
A variant of theAristotle-Ryle-Kenny-Vendler aspectual classes(Dowty, 1979) which can be reduced to durativ-ity and telicity (Comrie, 1976; Moens and Steed-man, 1988; Pulman, 1997) is analyzed in section3 through strings that arise naturally in the investi-gation of grinding in section 2.Some restraint on grinding is called for, as thesimplest strings are the most coarse-grained.
Sec-tion 4 enshrines this restraint as a principle, whilst30accommodating refinements as required.
The ideais that strings can be refined by enlarging somecontextually supplied set X of (interesting) flu-ents: the larger X is, the finer the grain becomes.An inverse system of string functions piX indexedby different finite sets X of fluents is constructed,and applied for an account of relations betweenstrings as well as branching time.
The relationshere go beyond the familiar order ?
for tense,stretching to the progressive and the perfect, froma variety of perspectives.2 Segmented versus whole fluentsFix a set ?
of fluents.
Fluents in ?

Gen-eralizing A-singular fluents, we call a fluent ?
A-whole if for all intervals I and I ?
such that I ?
I ?is an interval,I |= ?
and I ?

implies I = I ?.That is, any number of intervals may satisfy a A-whole fluent so long as no two form an interval.A A-whole fluent ?
defines a quantized predicate(Krifka, 1998) insofar as no two distinct intervalscan satisfy ?
if one is a subset of the other.
But the2Not much would be lost were we to take an interval I ,as in (Halpern and Shoham, 1991), to be a pair of points t, t?with t  t?, or, as in (Allen, 1983), t ?
t?.3For finite T , A-segmented is the same as A-pointed.ban on pairs of intervals satisfying ?
is wider un-der A-wholeness.
For example, over T = {1, 2}, afluent holding at exactly {1} and {2} is not whole,even though {{1}, {2}} is quantized.A-wholeness shares half of A-segmentedness: afluent ?
is A-summable if for all intervals I and I ?in A such that I ?
I ?
is an interval,I |= ?
and I ?

implies I ?
I ?

I ?
is an interval,A-summability coincides with additivity in (Bach,1981), illustrated in (4).

V?holds in only one out of a possible multitude ofsegs of I with length 3.
The choice of a seg canbe a delicate matter.
A string of sets of fluents ex-presses such a choice.
The present section linksthat choice to aspect, stepping from a fluent ?
toa set L of strings of finite sets of fluents, withoutrequiring that L hold at every seg of every intervalsatisfying ?.
That is, the account of aspect givenbelow makes essential use of the string represen-tations over and above the fluents from which thestrings are formed.
Fluents/intervals describe ob-jective matters of fact; strings/segmentations em-body, in addition, particular perspectives on thesematters.A concrete linguistic illustration is provided bythe notion that some events are punctual ?
i.e.,lacking in internal structure.
(Comrie, 1976) dis-cusses the example of cough, noting that ?theinherent punctuality of cough would restrict therange of interpretations that can be given to im-perfective forms of this verb?
to an iterative read-ing (of a series of coughs), as opposed to a singlecough, which he refers to as semelfactive.
Comrieconcedes, however, that, in fact, one can imaginea situation where someone is comment-ing on a slowed down film which incor-porates someone?s single cough, as forinstance in an anatomy lecture: here, itwould be quite appropriate for the lec-turer to comment on the relevant part ofthe film and now the subject is cough-ing, even in referring to a single cough,since the single act of coughing has nowbeen extended, and is clearly durative, inthat the relevant film sequence lasts fora certain period of time.
(page 43)The earlier contention that coughing can only beread iteratively suggests that the intervals spannedby single coughs are too small for our ?normal?segmentations.
These segmentations consist ofintervals too big for ?punctual?
events, leadingto a representation of a ?-semelfactive as ?A?
?rather than say, (8), with a middle box ??
of in-ternal structure supporting the progressive.
(8) ??,??mi???
??
??,??m??
?33The special context provided above by an anatomylecture overturns this restriction, making (8) avail-able after all.
The punctual-durative distinction isevidently not cast in stone.
But just what is du-rative?
The simple proposal this section exploresis that what is durative is a string ?1?2 ?
?
?
?n ofsets ?i of fluents with n ?
3.
Between the firstbox ?1 and the last box ?n is a string ?2 ?
?
?
?n?1representing internal structure that, for n ?
3, isnon-empty.4Apart from the length n of a string ?1 ?
?
?
?n,there is also the matter of what fluents to box ina string, describing the interior as well as the im-mediate exterior of the situation the string repre-sents.
(The string in (8) is just an example to fleshout or otherwise revise.)
Of particular relevanceto temporal extent are any fluents chosen to markthe boundaries of the situation.
An example in (9)is the fluent ?
which makes the string ?telic?
byappearing in all its boxes negated, except for therightmost box, which it marks.
(9) ??,??
??,??
?Whether or not the intervals described by ?1 and?n count as part of the situation represented by thestring is independent of (10).
(10) a.
?1 ?
?
?
?n is durative if it has length n ?
3b.
?1 ?
?
?
?n is telic if the negation of some?
in ?n appears in ?i for 1 ?
i < n.While (10a) says ?1 ?
?
?
?n has internal structure,(10b) says ?1 ?
?
?
?n culminates in some fluent?
?
?n.
(10b) is even more representational than(10a) in that it depends not only on segmenting aninterval but on the choice of fluents we put intoa string describing that segmentation.
As Krifkanotes, the telic-atelic distinction lies not ?in the na-ture of the object described, but in the descriptionapplied to the object?
asone and the same event of running canbe described by running (i.e.
by an atelic4Segmentations of the full linear order T into 2 or 3 inter-vals are central to the interpretation of event radicals in (Gal-ton, 1987).
A formal occurrence is defined there to be a pairB,A of intervals such that either AB ?

(A ?

The intuition isthat B is before, and A after the situation with temporal ex-tent T ?
(A ?

The first box ?1 and last box ?n of astring ?1 ?

Segs generalize formal occurrences,elaborating on internal as well as external structure.predicate) or by running a mile (i.e.
atelic, or delimited, predicate)(Krifka, 1998, page 207).5 Krifka goes on to lo-cate telicity not in objects but in sets P of objectsmeeting the condition in (11a), based on a properpart relation < on objects induced by a sum oper-ation ?
according to (11b).
(11) a. P is quantized if there are no x, y ?
Psuch that x < yb.
x < y ??
x 6= y and x?
y = yUnder (11), the predicate run a mile is quantized,whereas the predicate run is not, even though oneand the same run may belong to both predicates.But what about run to the post office?
Surely, thesecond half of any run to the post office is also arun to the post office.
A telic string may fail tobe quantized because its left boundary (inception)has not been specified.3.1 Subsumption and superpositionSome notation from (Fernando, 2004) will comein handy in what follows.

are (Fer-nando, 2004)).
Notice that{s}&{s?}

if length(s)= length(s?
)and the durative strings in L can be obtained bysuperposing L with +L& + = {s ?
L | s +}.3.2 Application to AktionsartSemelfactives, activities (= processes), achieve-ments (= culminations) and accomplishments (=culminated processes) are commonly differenti-ated on the basis of durativity and telicity (Moensand Steedman, 1988; Pulman, 1997).

An activity is durative but atelicc.

An accomplishment is telic and durativeUnder the present approach based on strings, (12)can be sharpened to (13).

(presupposing ?
is A-segmented)(Bach, 1986a) argues that processes are massand events are count, raising the question: howdoes the A-segmented/whole opposition sit withour account (13) of semelfactives, activities,achievements and accomplishments?
Bach?s pro-cesses are the activities in (13b), represented bythe durative strings in the language ?
+ that a A-segmented fluent ?
is A-segmentable as.
WhereA-whole fluents fit in (13) is, however, not im-mediately obvious.
But as pointed out by (Com-rie, 1976) for coughs and by (Krifka, 1998) for(mile-long) runs, there is an element of perspective(over and above pure, objective facts) that makesAktionsart pliable.
An achievement may, for in-stance, be coerced into an accomplishment to in-terpret the progressive in (14).
(14) The train was arriving when Anna went to or-der a drink.A seg II ?

, for some A-segmented?.As representations, strings are slippery in away that fixed pairs A, I are not; a shorter stringmight describe a larger interval than a longer stringdoes.
Strings are not so much finished objectsas makeshift representations subject to refinement.So should A-whole fluents go into these strings?The simplest examples of A-whole-fluents areA-singular fluents (harking back to Davidson?sevents as particulars).
Conceptualizing event timeat some level of abstraction as an interval is rea-son enough to form a fluent picking out that inter-val.
And with an A-singular fluent ?
comes the A-segmented fluent ?
?, and the fluents ??mi???
and??m???
from which to form the language L(?
)which ?
is A-segmentable as (Proposition 3).
(Dowty, 1979) explores the hypothesis thatthe different aspectual properties of thevarious kinds of verbs can be explainedby postulating a single homogeneousclass of predicates ?
stative predicates?
plus three or four sentential operatorsand connectives(page 71).
A simplified event-based reformulation(15) of the Vendler classes in terms of Dowty?soperators DO, BECOME and CAUSE is given in(Rothstein, 2004), page 35.35(15) states ?e.P (e)activities ?e.

(DO(P ))(e1) ?
Cul(e) = e2]Dowty?s CAUSE operator is reworked in (15) witha sum operation ?S producing singular entities,and a culmination function Cul.
The resulting ac-complishment e is the sum e1?S e2 of its prepara-tory process (activity) e1 and culmination e2.
Tobring (13) in line with (15), we putDO(P ) ?

.Left out of (13) are the states in (15), which canbe compared to A-segmented fluents in the presentframework.
As noted in (Dowty, 1986), one mightalso require that stative fluents be inertial, forwhich see (Fernando, 2008).4 Desegmenting and branching timeWhy segment an interval?
The two reasons givenabove are (1) to get a handle on durativity andtelicity, and (2) to unwind an interval fluent suchas E?
?A?R to a string E?
E?,R E?
interpretedagainst segmentations (i.e.
finite timelines).
Nei-ther reason justifies grinding indefinitely.
Thethrust of the present section is to leave segs ascoarse as possible, segmenting only if necessary,leading to a notion of time that may branch.4.1 Desegmenting via piQuantifying the model A out of the notion of A-segmentability and weakening the connection be-tween intervals and segs, let us agree that a lan-guage L depicts ?

.In general, a description sX of granularity X canbe refined to one sX?
of granularity X ?
?
X pro-vided piX maps sX?
to sX .
More precisely, givensome large set ?
of fluents, let Fin(?)
be the setof finite subsets of ?.
A function f with domainFin(?)
mapping X ?
Fin(?)
to a string f(X)over the alphabet 2X is said to be pi-consistent ifwhenever X ?
X ?
?
Fin(?
),f(X) = piX(f(X?
)).Let us write ILpi(?)
for the set of all pi-consistentfunctions.
?IL?
here stands not for intensionallogic but for inverse limit ?
to be precise, the in-verse limit of the restrictions of piX to (2X?)?
forX ?
X ?
?
Fin(?)
(all computable by finite-state transducers).
That said, ILpi(?)
is inten-sional: time branches under the relation ??
be-tween f, f ?

ILpi(?)

f?
??
f 6= f ?
and (?X ?
Fin(?
))f(X) is a prefix of f ?
(X)(where s is a prefix of s?
if s?
= ss?
for somepossibly empty string s?).
The intuition is that atemporal moment comes with its past, and thatan f ?
ILpi(?)
encodes the moment that is X-approximated, for each X ?
Fin(?
), by the last37box in f(X), with past given by the remainder off(X) (leading to that box).
More precisely, ??
istree-like in the sense of (Dowty, 1979).Proposition 5.
??
is transitive and left linear: forevery f ?
IL(?

f) f1 ??
f2 orf2 ??
f1 or f1 = f2.Moreover, no element of ILpi(?)
is ?
?-maximal.Maximal chains, called histories in (Dowty, 1979),figure prominently in possible worlds semantics.While we can pick one out in ILpi(?)
to representan actual history, it is far from obvious what sig-nificance maximal ?
?-chains have in the presentframework, which is closer in spirit to situationsemantics (Bawise and Perry, 1983), updated in(Cooper, 2005; Ginzburg, 2005).Tha handbook chapter (Thomason, 1984) openswith the declarationPhysics should have helped us to re-alise that a temporal theory of a phe-nomenon X is, in general, more than asimple combination of two components:the statics of X and the ordered set oftemporal instants.
The case in whichall functions from times to world-statesare allowed is uninteresting; there aretoo many such functions, and the the-ory has not begun until we have begunto restrict them.
And often the princi-ples that emerge from the interaction oftime with the phenomena seem new andsurprising.For a non-empty set W of worlds, and a linearlyordered set T of time instants, Thomason com-pares T ?
W -frames, not unlike that in (Mon-tague, 1973), unfavorably to tree-like frames, ofwhich ??
above is an example, when paired witha ?-maximal ??-chain.
The crudeness of thecartesian product ?
aside, one may ask where Tcomes from, as Bach pointedly does in page 69 of(Bach, 1981), to say nothing of W .
The answerfrom ILpi(?)
involves strings formed from flu-ents.
The projective system (piX)X?Fin(?)
givesfor every finite subset X of ?, a choice of X-approximations in (2X)?, including for X ={e, e?}
with e 6= e?, 13 strings sr correspondingto the Allen interval relations r between intervalse and e?

Under the projections piX , these stringsare most naturally viewed as indices for evalu-ating an expression ?
as an extension or deno-tation, as prescribed by Carnap-Montague inten-sions (Fernando, 2011).
In (Bach, 1986b), anevent type such as KISSING induces a functionEXT(KISSING) that maps histories to subpartsthat are temporal manifestations of KISSING,treating input histories as indices and output mani-festations as extensions.
Under the current frame-work, EXT(KISSING) can for any X ?
Fin(?
),be given as a binary relation between strings in(2X)?
thatX-approximate indices and extensions.5 ConclusionSegmentations arise naturally in the view from(Klein, 2009) thatThe expression of time in natural lan-guages relates a clause-internal tempo-ral structure to a clause-external tem-poral structure.
The latter may shrinkto a single interval, for example, thetime at which the sentence is uttered; butthis is just a special case.
The clause-internal temporal structure may also bevery simple ?
it may be reduced to a sin-gle interval without any further differen-tiation, the ?time of the situation?
; but ifthis ever happens, it is only a borderlinecase.
As a rule, the clause-internal struc-38ture is much more complex.
(page 75)The simplest case described by the passage is il-lustrated by the picture (16) of the clause-internalevent (or situation) time E preceding the clause-external speech (utterance) time S.(16) E S + E S depicting E???
?SSlightly more complicated is the picture (3) ofevent time E with R inside it.

(segmented E?, whole R)Whereas E in (16) is unbroken and whole, the?differentiation?
in (3) puts E through a universalgrinder ??
described in section 2, alongside notionsof A-whole and A-segmented fluents, the contrastbetween which surfaces in pairs such as (17) and(18).

Ernest explained(18) Ernest was laughing |?
Ernest laughedThe non-entailment (17) is clear from (19).
(19) Ernest was explaining when he was made tostop.To extract a rigorous account of (17) versus (18)from the assumption that explaining is whole andlaughing is segmented (as fluents) would requirestepping beyond lexical/internal aspect (consid-ered in sections 2 and 3 above) to grammati-cal/external aspect, hinted at in (3), as well astense.
Some details compatible with the presentapproach can be found in (Fernando, 2008).6 Suf-fice it to say that additional temporal parametersfrom tense and aspect enlarge the set X of fluentsthat, under the inverse limit ILpi(?)
in section 4,refines granularity.
While we have taken pains toshow how to interpret a string of subsets of ?
in6An alternative would be to follow along (Galton, 1984;Galton, 1987).
There are likely to be many ways to fill inthe details.
In the case of the perfect, for instance, the basicapproach outlined here is, as far as I can tell, neutral betweenextended now accounts (Pancheva, 2003) augmented with (7)(7) a. V?

(depicting V @ E)and consequent-state approaches (Moens and Steedman,1988; Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Pulman, 1997) that might beaugmented with inertia (Dowty, 1986) and forces (Fernando,2008).a segmentation (essentially, a finite, ordered par-tition of an interval from a ?-timeline), no ?-timeline is used to define ILpi(?
), resulting in anotion of time that branches (away from any singlesegmentation or timeline).
There is sure to be junkin ILpi(?)
to throw out; but what use tense andaspect might have for timelines not represented inILpi(?
), I fail to see (apart from linking tempo-rality up with other linguistic mechanisms such asquantification).
Work on tense and aspect has ledto extensions of ordinary temporal logic in threedirections.
