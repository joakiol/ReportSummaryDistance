In this pa-per, we demonstrate how the frame-to-framerelations described in the FrameNet ontologycan be used to improve the performance ofa FrameNet-based semantic role classifier forSwedish, a low-resource language.
In orderto make use of the FrameNet relations, wecast the semantic role classification task asa non-atomic label prediction task.
The ex-periments show that the cross-frame general-ization methods lead to a 27% reduction inthe number of errors made by the classifier.For previously unseen frames, the reduction iseven more significant: 50%.1 IntroductionThe FrameNet lexical database and annotated cor-pora, based on the theory of semantic frames (Fill-more et al, 2003), have allowed the implementa-tion of automatic systems to extract semantic roles(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Johansson and Nugues,2007; Ma`rquez et al, 2008; Das et al, 2010).Since the original FrameNet is developed for theEnglish language, most research on semantic roleextraction has focused exclusively on English.
How-ever, the English FrameNet has inspired similar ef-forts for other languages.
For instance, the ongo-ing development of a Swedish FrameNet (Borin etal., 2010) allows us to investigate the feasibilityof using this resource in constructing an automaticrole-semantic analyzer for Swedish.
However, dueto the fact that the Swedish FrameNet annotationprocess is in a fairly early stage, not much anno-tated material is available, and this limits the perfor-mance attainable by automatic classifiers trained onthese data.
In particular, the scarce amount of datamakes it very hard for the machine learning meth-ods to discern general linguistic facts concerning thesyntactic?semantic linking patterns, such as the rela-tion between the voice of a verb, the syntactic func-tions of its arguments, and the semantic roles of thearguments (Dowty, 1991).In this paper, we show that the inter-frame rela-tions described in the FrameNet ontology allow usto generalize across frames.
This allows the clas-sifier to learn general linguistic facts, and it alsoleads to more efficient use of the annotated data.To allow this kind of generalization, we formulatethe semantic role selection problem as a classifica-tion task with non-atomic labels.
This cross-framegeneralization method reduces the number of errorsmade by the classifier by 27%, improving the accu-racy from 54.4 to 66.5.
When evaluating on framesfor which the classifier has not been trained, the ac-curacy improves from 7.2 (random performance) to53.4, a 50% error reduction.2 The Swedish FrameNetThe Swedish FrameNet, SweFN, is a lexical re-source under development (Friberg Heppin andToporowska Gronostaj, 2012), based on the Englishversion of FrameNet constructed by the Berkeley re-search group (Baker et al, 1998).
It is found on theSweFN website1, and is available as a free resource.The SweFN frames and frame names correspondto the English ones, with some exceptions, as dothe selection of frame elements including defini-tions and internal relations.
The meta-informationabout the frames, such as semantic relations be-tween frames, is also transferred from the BerkleyFrameNet.
Compared to the Berkeley FrameNet,SweFN is expanded with information about the do-main of the frames, at present: general language, themedical and the art domain.1http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/swefn95At the time of writing this paper, SweFN cov-ered 519 frames with around 18,000 lexical units.The lexical units are gathered from SALDO, a freeSwedish electronic association lexicon (Borin andForsberg, 2009).
A lexical unit from SALDO can-not populate more than one frame.
At present thereare 31 frames in SweFNwhich do not match a framein the Berkeley FrameNet.
Of these, there are eightcompletely new frames while the others have beenmodified in some way.Crucially for the work presented in this paper,each frame is exemplified with at least one sentence.The number of sentences is currently 2,974.
Themost well-annotated frames are EXPERIENCER OBJwith 38 sentences, CAUSE MOTION with 21, andCAUSE HARM with 19.
These sentences form thetraining material used in the following sections.3 System ImplementationIn this section, we describe the implementation ofour semantic role labeling system.
In order to beuseful on its own, such a system needs to solve sev-eral tasks: (1) identification of predicate words; (2)assignment of frames to predicate words; (3) iden-tification of role fillers; (4) assignment of semanticrole labels to role fillers.
In this paper, we focus ex-clusively on the semantic role classification task.3.1 Baseline: A Classifier for SwedishSemantic RolesFollowing most previous implementations, we useda syntactic parse tree as the basis of the semanticrole extraction; we assumed that every semantic rolespan coincides with the projection of a subtree inthe syntactic tree.
The tasks of segmentation andlabeling then reduce to a classification problem onsyntactic tree nodes.
Each sentence was parsed bythe LTH dependency parser (Johansson and Nugues,2008a), which we trained on a Swedish treebank(Nilsson et al, 2005).
Figure 1 shows a sentence an-notated with a dependency tree and semantic roles.The semantic role labeling classifier was imple-mented as a linear multiclass classifier with a flexi-ble output space depending on the frame of the givenpredicate; we trained this classifier using an onlinelearning algorithm (Crammer et al, 2006).
In ad-dition, we imposed a uniqueness constraint on thelabels output by the classifier, so that every role mayappear only once for a given predicate.We considered a large number of features for theclassifier (Table 1).
Most of these are commonlyused features taken from the standard literature onsemantic role labeling.
We then applied a standardgreedy forward feature selection procedure to deter-mine which of them to use.
The features contain-ing SALDO ID refer to the entry identifiers in theSALDO lexicon.
Note that the POS tags have coarseand fine variants, such as VERB and VERB-FINITE-PRESENT-ACTIVE respectively, and we used both ofthem.Semantic role classifiers rely heavily on lexicalfeatures (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b), and thismay lead to brittleness; in order to increase robust-ness, we added features based on hierarchical clus-ters constructed using the Brown algorithm (Brownet al, 1992).
The Brown algorithm clusters wordinto hierarchies represented as bit strings.
Based ontuning on a development set, we found that it wasbest not to use the full bit string, but only a prefix ifthe string was longer than 12 bits.FRAMEDEPENDENCY RELATION PATHFRAME ELEMENTSPOSITIONVOICEARGUMENT HEAD SALDO IDARGUMENT HEAD LEMMAARGUMENT HEAD POS (FINE)PREDICATE POS (FINE)ARGUMENT POS (COARSE)ARGUMENT RIGHT CHILD POS (COARSE)ARGUMENT WORDPREDICATE WORD CLUSTERARGUMENT WORD CLUSTERTable 1: List of classifier features.3.2 A Classifier Using Non-atomic SemanticRole LabelsThe classifier described above is a quite typical ex-ample of how semantic role classifiers are normallyimplemented: each frame is independent of all otherframes.
However, in our case, when the amount oftraining data is quite small, the limitations of thisstandard approach become apparent:?
Since there are many frames, the amount oftraining data for each frame is very limited.96Vi promenerar so?derut fra?n Lindholmen la?ngs Norra ?Alvstrandens brokiga kontur .SSRARA PARADT DTATPAIPSELF MOVER DIRECTIONSOURCEPATHSELF MOTIONFigure 1: A sentence with dependency syntax (above) and semantic role structure (below).?
Basic linguistic facts, such as which roles arelikely to appear in subject position, have to berelearned for each frame.To remedy these problems, we developed a classi-fier using non-atomic labels: instead of just a simplelabel INGESTION:INGESTOR, the classifier can pre-dict several labels, using some sort of decompositioninto meaningful parts.
In ?3.3, we will describe sev-eral such decompositions.As described above, our baseline classifier is astandard linear classifier.

is a feature function describing features ofthe argument a taking the semantic role r, and w is aweight vector produced by some training algorithm.This classifier model can easily be generalized tothe non-atomic case.
We then assume that each roler can be decomposed using a decomposition func-tion D, which returns a set of labels.
We now applythe feature function to each sub-label l instead of themain label r.r?

(a, l)Non-atomic classification has been described in anumber of publications.
It is fairly common in textcategorization, where hierarchical classification isprobably the most common type.
One of the mostsimilar to ours is the action classifier by Roth andTu (2009), which handled a large label set by de-composing the labels into meaningful parts.3.3 Generalization MethodsWe investigated several ways of analyzing the labels,and most of them were based on the properties ofthe frames, defined in the FrameNet ontology.
TheSwedish FrameNet currently does not define suchproperties, but since the frames and frame elementsare for the most part based on their English coun-terparts, we used the English ontology.
In case ofmismatch, we just left the label in its original state.The first method we tried was based on frame-to-frame relations.
We used the following relations:INHERITANCE: specific to general, e.g.
COMMU-NICATION NOISE to COMMUNICATION.SUBFRAME: from component to complex, e.g.SETTING OUT to TRAVEL.CAUSATIVE-OF: causative to inchoative,e.g.
CAUSE TEMPERATURE CHANGE toINCH.
CHANGE OF TEMP..INCHOATIVE-OF: inchoative to stative, e.g.INCH.
CHANGE OF TEMP.
to TEMPERATURE.USING: child to parent, e.g.
COMMUNICA-TION NOISE to MAKE NOISE.PERSPECTIVE-ON: perspectivized to neutral, e.g.RIDE VEHICLE to USE VEHICLE.To analyze a label in terms of frame-to-framerelations, we applied the transitive closure ofeach relation and returned the resulting set.
Forinstance, when applying the Inheritance rela-tion to the INGESTION:INGESTOR label, we getthe following set: { INGESTION:INGESTOR,INGEST SUBSTANCE:INGESTOR, MANIPU-LATION:AGENT, INTENT.
AFFECT:AGENT,INTENT.
ACT:AGENT, TRANS.
ACTION:AGENT }.The second method was based on the semantictype of the semantic role.
For instance, the INGES-TION:INGESTOR role needs to be filled by an en-tity of the semantic type SENTIENT.
The decom-position of this role then simply becomes { INGES-TION:INGESTOR, SENTIENT }.The third method was based on the simple no-tion label generalization: if two semantic roles97in two different frames have the same name,then we use the same label.
For instance,we change the INGESTION:INGESTOR and IN-GEST SUBSTANCE:INGESTOR to INGESTOR.
Wenormalized the spelling, punctuation, and capitaliza-tion of the labels before generalizing.4 ExperimentsWe evaluated the classifier on the example sentencesin the Swedish FrameNet.
The frame and the ar-gument were given to the classifier, which then hadto predict the semantic role.
We evaluated in twodifferent ways: In-frame evaluation, where a 5-foldcross-validation was carried out over the set of sen-tences, and Out-frame evaluation, where the cross-validation was done over the set of frames.
The out-frame setting simulates the situation where a newframe has been defined, but no training data havebeen annotated.
Without any sort of cross-framegeneralization, the classification in the out-framesetting becomes a random baseline.Table 2 shows the results of using the frame-to-frame relations for analyzing the semantic role la-bels.
We see that decomposition based on Inheri-tance is by far the most effective of these, althoughthe highest performance is obtained when combin-ing all types of relation-based decompositions.Classifier In-frame Out-frameBaseline 54.4 7.2Inheritance 58.7 28.1Using 55.8 20.5Subframe 54.8 11.5Causative-of 54.5 9.7Perspective-on 54.5 8.1Inchoative-of 54.4 8.0All except Inheritance 56.0 24.0All relations 59.6 36.9Table 2: Classification results with generalization basedon frame-to-frame relations.The effect of analyzing labels in terms of semantictype is similar.
The in-frame performance is higherthan that of relation-based decomposition, while theout-frame performance is a bit lower.
The two gen-eralization methods seem to complement each other,since we get a higher performance by combiningthem.
Table 3 shows the results.Classifier In-frame Out-frameSemantic type 61.7 31.7Semantic type + relations 63.5 42.6Table 3: Adding semantic type generalization.Finally, Table 4 shows the effect of using labelgeneralization.
This is by far the most effectivemethod.
However, we get even higher performanceby combining it with the other two methods.Classifier In-frame Out-frameLabel generalization 65.9 51.5LG + ST + relations 66.5 53.4Table 4: Results with label generalization.5 DiscussionWhen developing NLP systems for a low-resourcelanguage, it is crucial to make effective use of theavailable data.
In the case of FrameNet semanticrole classification, one way to improve the use of thedata is to generalize the roles across the frames.
Thisalso makes sense from a theoretical point of view,since predicting multiple labels allows the machinelearner to learn general facts as well as specifics.This work builds on previous work in multi-labelclassification.
For the task of FrameNet semanticrole classification, the work most closely related toours is that by Matsubayashi et al (2009), which de-fined a classifier making use of role groups; the ef-fect of the role groups turns out to be similar to ournon-atomic classification approach.Our experiments showed very significant error re-ductions.
This was especially notable in the case ofout-frame evaluation, which is to be expected sincethe baseline in this case was a random selection.
Thebest classifier used all three types of label decom-position, and achieved a 26% in-frame and a 50%out-frame error reduction.AcknowledgementsThe research presented here was supported by theSwedish Research Council (the project SwedishFramenet++, VR dnr 2010-6013) and by the Uni-versity of Gothenburg through its support of theCentre for Language Technology and Spra?kbanken(the Swedish Language Bank).98ReferencesCollin F.
