Comparing corpora with WordSmith Tools:How large must the reference corpus be?Tony BERBER-SARDINHALAEL, Catholic University of Sao PauloRua Monte Alegre 98405014-001 Sao Paulo SP, Braziltony4@uol.com.brAbstractWordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers aprogram for comparing corpora, known asKeyWords.
KeyWords compares a word listextracted from what has been called 'thestudy corpus' (the corpus which theresearcher is interested in describing) with aword list made from a reference corpus.
Theonly requirement for a word list to beaccepted as reference corpus by the softwareis that must be larger than the study corpus.one of the most pressing questions withrespect to using KeyWords eems to be whatwould be the ideal size of a referencecorpus.
The aim of this paper is thus topropose answers to this question.
FiveEnglish corpora were compared to referencecorpora of various sizes (varying from twoto 100 times larger than the study corpus).The results indicate that a reference corpusthat is five times as large as the study corpusyielded a larger number of keywords than asmaller reference corpus.
Corpora largerthan five times the size of the study corpusyielded similar amounts of keywords.
Theimplication is that a larger eference corpusis not always better than a smaller one, forWordSmith Tools Keywords analysis, whilea reference corpus that is less than five timesthe size of the study corpus may not bereliable.
There seems to be no need for usingextremely arge reference corpora, given thatthe number of keywords yielded do notseem to change by using corpora larger thanfive times the size of the study corpus.IntroductionWordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers aprogram for comparing corpora, known asKeyWords.
This tool has been used in severalstudies as a means for describing various lexico-grammatical characteristics of different genres(Barbara nd Scott, 1999; Batista, 1998; BerberSardinha, 1995, 1999a, b; Berber Sardinha ndShimazumi, 1998; Bonamin, 1999; Collins andScott, 1996; Conde, 1999; Dutra, 1999; Freitas,1997; Fuzetti, 1999; Granger and Tnbble, 1998;Lima-Lopes, 1999; Lopes, 2000; Ramos, 1997;Santos, 1999; Scott, 1997; Silva, 1999; Tribble,1998).
The keywords identified by the programare not necessarily the 'most important words' inthe corpus (Scott, 1997), or those thatcorrespond to readers' intuitions as to what thetopics of the texts are.
It is generally thought thata set of WordSmith Tools keywords indicate'aboutness' (Phillips, 1989).KeyWords compares a word list extractedfrom what has been called 'the study corpus'(the corpus which the researcher is interested indescribing) with a word list made from areference corpus.
The result is a list ofkeywords, or words whose frequencies arestatistically higher in the study corpus than inthe reference corpus.
The software alsoidentifies words whose frequencies arestatistically ower in the study corpus, which arecalled 'negative keywords', in contrast topositive keywords, which have higherfrequencies in the study corpus.
Negativekeywords, though, will not be discussed in thepresent paper.
Hence, whenever keyword ismentioned in this paper, it will mean 'positivekeyword'.The only requirement for a word list to beaccepted as reference corpus by the software isthat must be larger than the study corpus.
Thus,the composition and length of KeyWord lists canvary according to at least six parameters:?
The composition of the study corpus.?
The composition of the referencecorpus.?
The size of the study corpus;.?
The size of the reference corpus.?
The statistical test used in thecomparison of frequencies (log-likelihood and chi-square are available).?
The level of significance (p) used as the'keyness' benchmark (the cut-off point).Since WordSmith Tools is Windows software,it has appealed to a large audience of appliedlinguists willing to do corpus-based research, towhom this platform is generally the only onethat they know how to use.
To them, one of themost pressing questions with respect o usingKeyWords seems to be what would be the idealsize of a reference corpus.
The aim of this paperis thus to propose answers to this question.1 Using KeyWordsA KeyWord list is a portion of the studycorpus word list.
KeyWords compares thefrequencies for each type in the study andreference corpora.
The program calculates thelog-likelihood (G2) 1 or Chi-Square (X 2) of eachword form based on its distribution in bothcorpora, an example of which is given in thetable below.StudycorpusReferencecorpusWordform x10(10%)10(1%)Remainingword formsTotal90 (90%) 100(100%)1000 (99%) 1010(100%)For a distribution such as the above, both thelog-likelihood and chi-square statistics wouldprobably flag the word form in question as akeyword, since its frequencies in the twocorpora are so different (10% versus 1%).
Theway KeyWords processes word lists is notunique, and has been applied by researchersusing other software (De Cock, Granger, Leech,and McEnery, 1998; Granger and Rayson, 1998;Milton, 1998).After processing the word lists, the keywordlists appear in WordSmith Tools as illustratedbelow.1 See Dunning (1992) for the formulae.From left to right, the columns in the windowrefer to:LI'P'~ l\[\] ,1- ~_1.~1i 192 0,905 97.787 0.11 495.7 0.000000JOB 91 0,4,5 19.454 0.02 3,80.4 0.000000LOVE 93 0,46 21.296 0.02 376.6 0.000000RITA 33 O, 16 305 338.9 0.000000NOWADAYS 38 0,19 1.365 290.4 0.000000Is 45,,5 2,25 889.648 0,98 244.8 0.00000014 0,07 0 235.4 0.000000UNIVERSITY 51 0,25 15.333 0.02 180.3 0.000000PERSON 54 0,27 21.747 0.02 161.9 0.000000MONEY 60 0,30 31.442 0.03 151.6 0.0O0000LIVE 45 0,22 15.551 0.02 147.5 0.000000?

Corpus of newspaper reviews, from theBrown Corpus ('C' subcorpus).?
Corpus of mystery fiction, from theBrown Corpus ('L" subcorpus).?

The reasonfor choosing it is that newspaper text is the mosttypical kind of reference corpus used by appliedlinguists, mainly because it is easy to get.Therefore, the results obtained here would berelevant to the typical user of KeyWords.
Thereason for specifically choosing the Guardian isthat Mike Scott, the author of WordSmith Tools,makes it available on his website a word list of95 million tokens of The Guardian text on hiswebsite.
This has become a popular choice forseveral WordSmith Tools users investigatingEnglish keywords.
Once again, it was hoped thatby using The Guardian, the investigation wouldmirror a typical choice of WordSmith users.
Forthe present study, a portion of the Guardianword list was used, namely from texts publishedin 1994, taken randomly.The size of the reference corpora variedaccording to the size of the study corpora.
Foreach study corpus, 18 reference corpora werecreated.
Each one was n times larger than thestudy corpus, with n being 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100.
Forinstance, the letters corpus had 11,761 tokens,and so for n=2 the size of the reference corpuswas 23,552 tokens (11,761 * 2); for n=3, thereference corpus size was 35,283 (11,761 x 3),for n=4 47,044, and so on, up to n=100, whosesize was 1,176,100 words.The KeyWords settings used for thecomparisons were as follows:SettingProcedureMax p. valueMax wantedMin frequency* most allowedValueloglikelyhood0.01160(0*Table 1: KeyWords ettingsThe table below shows the size of all of thereference corpora used in the study:Size of reference corporaN=2 n=3x n=4 n=5 N=6 N=7Letters Tokens 23,522 35,283 47,044 58,805 70,566 82,327EditorialsReviewsMysterySci-FiTypes 5,543 10,161 11,16371,48212,249Tokens 109,252 163,878 218,504 273,130 327,756 382,382Types 14,973 18,378 21,746 24,118 26,537 28,382Tokens 178,70511,0007,409 8,863107,223 142,96414,331 17,758148,324i7,550 9,032214,446Types250,18719,490 21,559 23,402Tokens 96,596 144,894 193,192 241,490 289,788 338,086Types 13,880 17,636 ~20,285 22,861 24,925 26,928Tokens 24,162 36,243 60,405 72,486 84,5675,644 Types 11,318Size of reference corpora10,325 12,422n=8 n=9 n=10 n=20 n=30 n=40Letters Tokens 94,088 105,849 117,610 235,220 352,830 470,44013,095Editorialsi!iReviewsMysterySci-FiTypes 13,896 14,87914,209 15,15622,650 27,763 31A71Tokens 437,008 !491,634 546,260 1092,520 1,638,780 12,185,040Types 30,292 31,825 33,672 47,305 57,325 65,237Tokens 285,928 321,669 357,410 714,820 1,072,230 1,429,640Types 24,940 26,524 27,812 38,610 47,081 53,695Tokens 386,384 434,682 482,980 1965,960 1,448,940 1,931,920Types 28,563 30,084 31,669 i44,755 53,867 61,531Tokens 96,648 108,729 120,810 i241,620 362,430 483,240113,305 28,144Size of reference corpora22,918 Types 32,010n=50 n=60 n=70 In=80 n=90 n=100Letters Tokens 588,050 705,660 823,270 940,880 1,058,490 1,176,100Types 35,083 38,560EditorialsReviewsMysterySci-Fi42,421 44,607 47,061 48,902Tokens 2,731,300 3,277,560 3,823,820 4,370,080 4,916,340 5,462,600Types 71,680 77,397 82,743 87,902 92,884 97,121Tokens 1,787,050 2,144,460 12,501,870 2,859,280 3,216,690 3,574,100Types 59,690 64,753 !69,242 73,167 76,945 80,574Tokens 2,414,900 2,897,880 3,380,860 3,863,840 4,346,820 14,829,800Types 68,117 73,623 78,508 83,076 87,578 \[92,157Tokens 604,050 724,860 845,670 966,480 1,087,290 \[1,208,10042,822 Types 45,101 38,959 47,474Table 2: Size of reference corpora135,460 49,6173 ResultsThe results for the total number of keywordsobtained are shown in the following table.

of the total number of types in the study corpus).The results indicate that he number of keywordsincreases as the size of the reference corpusincreases, but this increase is not linear.
Forinstance, the keywords for n=2 in the letterscorpus was 279, for n=3 it was 347, and for n=100 the total keywords was 475.
Had the growthbeen linear, for n=3 there would be 418keywords, and for n=100 13,950.
Obviously, atotal of 13,950 keywords could never have beenobtained since die maximum possible number of10keywords in the letters corpus is 2,415, which isthe total number of types.
The same is true of allthe other corpora.This suggests that there must be a point atwhich the growth in number of keywordsdiminishes.
This can be shown by plotting thenumber of keywords for each size of n across allthe study corpora, as in the graph below.2520151050size of reference corpus (n)* Letters?

EditorialsPlot 1: Distribution of keywordsThe plot shows that for all study corpora thekeyword totals rose from n=2 to n=3, then fell orstabilized at n=4, rose again at n=5 and fromthen on basically reached aplateau.
For instance,for the letters corpus, the keyword totals for n=2,n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6 were respectively 11.6,14.4, 14.7, 19.9, and 19.9.
Hence, there wasindeed a considerable rise from n=2 to n=3 (11.6to 14.4), followed by a slight rise at n=4 (14.7),then a major increase at n=5 (19.9), and therewas no change from n=5 to n=6 (19.9 to 19.9).In order to check where the major changesoccurred, an ANOVA was run on the keywordtotals across the various n sizes.
The results areshown in the table below.Source df I SSSize ofn 21 \] 1540.8087Error 68i18.6184Total 18911559.4271F Ip267.98 \[ < 0.0001Table 4: Results of ANOVA for keyword totalsacross reference corporaThe value of F(21,68)=267.98 is significant atp<0.0001, which indicates that size of thereference corpora had a significant effect on thekeyword totals.
This does not show us thedifferences in keyword totals among n sizes.In order to know at which n sizes the keywordtotals are statistically different, the REGWF(Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch) Multiple F Testwas run in SAS.
The results appear in the tablebelow, in decreasing order of the averagepercentage of keyword totals across the fivestudy corpora.AAAAAAAAAAAGroupings Avg.

Keywordtotals in the same grouping are not statisticallydifferent.
Hence, sizes of n equal to 40, 60, 20,100, 80, 90, 30, 70, 50, 5, and 6 formedgrouping A, which has on average 14.066% to14.884% keyword totals.
Likewise, n sizes equalto 70, 50, 5, 6, and 8 were in grouping B, withaverages ranging from 13.686% to 14.694%.Note that this is overlap among groupings, andso groupings A, B, C and D are in fact joined.This grouping comprises n sizes ranging from 5to 100.
The remaining groupings are non-overlapping: grouping E was formed by n sizes3 and 4, and grouping F by n=2.Therefore, there are two basic divisions in theprevious table, namely at n sizes equal to 2, 3,11and 5.
These correspond tothe major peaks andplateaus visible in the plot.The results uggest, hen, that he critical valuefor a reference corpus eems to be five.
In otherwords, the answer to the question 'what is theideal size of a reference corpus' is five.
Areference corpus that is five times as large as thestudy corpus yields a larger number of keywordsthan a smaller eference corpus.
This means thatthe results of a keyword analysis based on areference corpus that is less than five times thesize of the study corpus could be very differentfrom a study done on a corpus, say, just threetimes larger than the study corpus, in so far asthe number ofkeywords go.
Several potentiallyrevealing keywords could be left out of theanalysis iftbe reference corpus is not as large asfive times or more.CondusionThe aim of this study was to estimate the idealsize of a reference corpus to be used inWordSmith Tools KeyWords procedure.KeyWords provides facilities for comparing astudy corpus to a reference corpus, which, bydefault, must be larger than study corpus.The results indicated that a reference corpusthat is five times larger than the study corpusyields a similar amount of keywords thanreference corpora that are up to 100 times largerthan the study corpus.
This was taken to meanthat a reference corpus does not need to be morethan five times larger than the study corpus.In sum, a larger eference corpus is not alwaysbetter than a smaller one, for WordSmith ToolsKeywords analysis.
There seems to be no needfor using extremely large reference corpora,given that the number of keywords yielded donot seem to change by using corpora larger thanfive times the size of the study corpus.
This maybe important for WordSmith Tools users, whomay be short of disk space and memory on theirPCs to process large reference corpora.
Asuggestion that might come out of this finding isthat researchers should not spend time andresources building, collecting or searching forlarger and larger eference corpora.
Resourceswould be better spent in the compilation ofreference corpora that are more suitable in termsof their contents viz ~ viz the study corpus.This study did not tackle several importantquestions.
One of them is whether the keywordsthat were identified represent the main conceptsor topics found the texts.
Aqualitative studywould be needed to answer this, as anindependent test of validity of the status of thekeywords.
Another question is the effect of thesize of the study corpus.
It is not known howstudy corpora of the same size behave in termsof the total keywords that they yield whencompared to reference corpora of the same size.Another question is the composition of thekeyword lists obtained.
This study restricteditself to quantitative aspects of keyword listvariation, but it would be important that changesbe assessed qualitatively as well.
In particular, itwould be pertinent to know which keywordswere added or dropped as the levels of nchanged ~.Finally, the fact that Brown corpustexts are short fragments and not whole textsmay have upset he results, since the number ofkeywords seems to vary considerably as afunction of the size of the texts (Mike Scott,personal communication).
Shorter texts provideless room for repetition, which in turn influencesword frequencies.AcknowledgementsMy thanks go to Mike Scott and the threeanonymous reviewers for their comments.ReferencesLeila Barbara nd Mike Scott (1999).
