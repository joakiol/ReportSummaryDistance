THE CONSORTIUM FOR LEX ICAL  RESEARCHY.
Wilks, Principal InvestigatorComputing Research LaboratoryNew Mexico State UniversityLas Cruces, New Mexico 88003PROJECT GOALSWork in computational linguistics has reached the pointwhere the performance of many natural anguage pro-cessing systems i limited by a "lexical bottleneck".
Thatis, such systems could handle much more text and pro-duce much more impressive application results were itnot for the fact that their lexicons are too small.The Association for Computational Linguistics has es-tablished the Consortium for Lexical Research (CLR),with DARPA funding at the Computing Research Lab-oratory.
The Consortium is advised by an ACL steer-ing committee consisting of Roy Byrd, Ralph Grishman,Mark Liberman and Don Walker.The task of the CLR is to facilitate research, makingavailable to the whole natural language processing com-munity certain resources now held only by a few groupsthat have special relationships with companies or dic-tionary publishers.
The CLR intends that agreementsare set up with "providers" on reassuring and advan-tageous terms to both suppliers and researchers.
TheCLR will as far as is practically possible accept contri-butions from any source, regardless of theoretical orien-tation, and make them available as widely as possible forresearch.RECENT RESULTSThe Consortium project officially started in January1991.
Since then, an infrastructure for distribution andreceipt of materials has been set up and contacts withresearchers and major publishers have been established.We have now reached a stage where memberships arebeing accepted and resources are being acquired and dis-tributed.Our current status can be summarized as follows:Distr ibut ion Secure ftp procedures have been set upfor three kinds of materiMs: free, members only, andrestricted (by a fee or additional contract or both)Collection A group of public domain resources havebeen obtained and cataloged and acquisitions ofsoftwareand data from publishers and researchers is ongoing.Contracts Together with our university lawyers, wehave developed contracts for members and providers.These are now undergoing final revision incorporatingchanges uggested by several publishers.Membership We have had inquiries from over 500 sites.The first membership agreements have now been re-ceived.Documentat ion We have prepared several types of in-formation related to the CLR holdings: A catalog ofshort (paragraph) descriptions of each holding, a catalogof where to find the holding (via ftp), and an individualdetailed descriptions of the software and data for eachholding.Publ ic i ty The Consortium has been announced throughemail network news, in the ACL journal, and at variousconferences in the U.S., Europe and Japan.In January 1992, the Consortium hosted a workshopwhere publishers, researchers from academia, govern-ment and industry, and lexicographers gathered to dis-cuss their needs and plans.
The feeback from the work-shop was positive and is now shaping the developmentof the CLR in its second year of existence.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARProvisional agreements have been established with Long-man and Harper-Collins for allowing us to act as a brokerfor their electronic materials.
These agreements will befinalized in the first part of this year.
This will be amajor milestone for the Consortium.
The form of theagreements hat they will sign with the members tillremains to be settled.
Once this is finalized, we hopethis will provide a model which will allow us to completeagreements more easily with other publishers.We plan to expand membership and holdings steadilyover the year, and progress toward our long term goal ofestablishing the Consortium as a self-supporting entity.?
