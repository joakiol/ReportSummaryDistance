INTRODUCTIONA pract ica l  s ized semantic dict ionary (thesaurus as widesence) is necessary for advanced natural  language process-ing.
We have been studying how to obtain semantic informa-tion for such semantic dictionary from a Japanese languagedictionary(Shinmeikai Kokugojiten,published by Sanseido,inmachine readable form)(1) containing about 60,000 entries.A dictionary contains meanings and usages of practicalsize of general words.
Espec ia l ly ,def in i t ion  sentences{DS:a brief notation} are important sources of information formeanings of general words.
Generally, DS of an entr~word{EW:a brief notation} is defined by qualifying its super ~.ordinate word or synonyms or hyponyms.
We call these wordsdefinition M~rds{DW:a brief notation}.We have been developing a system for extracting automat-ically DW related to EW from its DS, and for deciding theDW-EW relation (e) .
By this system,(hierarchical) relationsamong entry words in the dictionary are to be established.We constructed a sub-system for extract ing DSs corre-sponding to parts of speech, infrected form and meaning(def in i t ion)  number of each entry word(v) .In th is  paper, the features of DSs in the Japanese dic-t ionary,  an out l ine of the pi lot  system and the resu l t s  ofexperiment will be discussed.L_ ~EATURES_~RY JAPANE~~DICT IOBANY2 .~S~TUR~DSThe typical examples of DSs are as follows:(i) \ [~(z igzag  rule)\] : .

The word" - -N"  is the FW.In (4), DW is jus t  before the FE " t :~b~?~J~# '' andthe synonymous relation(DW~EW) holds between the DW andthe EW.
The FW " ~ "  denotes a usage of the EW.In (5), two DW<EWs hal(t, that is ,  the DW "NZ '~/~/"  <the EW "$~"  and the DW " ~ "  < the Ew "$~"  .

The FW is ident i -cal with the FE.
(Notes: "~ ' "  is  a sub-postpos i t ives ign i fy ing exempl i f icat ion.
)The features of DSs in the dict ionary are as follows:(a) Honorary, the f ina l  ~mrd in DS is DW.
(b) In some cases, the f ina l  expression in DS is YEass igning semantic re lat ion between DW and EW,and DW is just before the PE.
(c) Genraly, DW is modified by another phrase(modifier).
(d) In some cases, DS contains more than one DW.The following general s t ructure  is  obtained according tothese features.'

( I )  TYPEI: ... (\[MODIFIER\] .DN)*o(I1) TYPEII: .,.
(\[MODI~\]:ER\] .DW)*.
PEa445In TYPE I, the final word is DW.
In TYPEII, the finalexpression is FE, and BW is just before the FE.2.2 DW-EW RELATION IN DSWe will propose the following assumptions according toabove-mentioned features in order to extruct the DW-EWrelat ions from DOs of the general structure.
(~) When DS is in TYPE I , DS~EW.
Because DS is a phrase(or a compound word) as wide senoe.
(~) When DS is in TYPEll, SS pFE EW.Where pFE is binary relation assigned by FE, and SSis the shortened DS corresponding to (\[MODIFIER\], DW)*.?
\[MODIFIER\] ?
W ~ W(~) (\[MODIFIERi\] .We) * ~ \[MODIFIERa\] .WaWhere i,j : l~n, W is arbitrary word.The following general algorithm for deciding the DN-EWrelations is obtained by means of these assumptions.
(I) DS is in TYPE I (DS dosn't include FE),(A) DW is modified,(~) The number of DW is only one, then DW>EW(B) The number of DW are more than one, then CD(B) DW isn't modified ,(~) The number of DW is only one, then DW--EW(~) The number of DN are more than one, then DN<EW(II) DS is in TYPEII(DS includes FE),(A) DW is modified ,(a) The number of DW is only one,PFE is '> '  or '---' ,then BW>EW otherwise CO.(B) The number of DW are more than one, then CD(B) DW isn't modified ,(a) The number of DW is only one, then DW pFE EW(B) The number of DW are more than one,pFE is '< '  , then DW<EW otherwise CD.CD denotes that ON-EW relat ion i sn ' t  extracted mechani-cally from DS.
In this case, the extraction of DW-BW rela-tion needs human support at this stage.2,3 FEATURES OF FEFE prescribes hierarchical relations(e.g.
DW>EW, DW<EN,DW=EW, or DWmEW) or whole-part relation(DW~ EW).
(e.g.
On" \ [~( interbra in) \ ]  :.... ~(bra in)OD--~9 (a part Of)o" ,  the FE "6D- -~"  prescribes DW~ EW explicitly.
)Besides these re lat ions,  another relat ion between DW andBW are prescribed by special FEe(e.g.
"~T(under)"  ),which is called associative relation(R).There are so many FEs that they are mainly divided intofour patterns called functional patterns{FP: a brief nota-tion}.
FP is expressed by means of regular expression.
FPis necessary for extracting FE and DW-EW relation informa-t_j~_n_(i.e, information eccessary for deciding the DW-EWrelations) assigned by the FE.
FP also designates a placeof DW in DS,Main features of FP are as follows:(1) Type100 : \[,..DWj ?

P FW(4) Type400 : .,.DW ?
e~"446Motes) ~*  is arbitrary character string,(...)* is repitation of (,..),P is special phrase(e.g.
I c~ '~)  ,is concatination symbol.We got about one hundred seventy FWs.
These are classi-fied into two groups.
In one group(contained 64 FWs), theFNs contain explicitly DW-EN relation information.
In theother group(contained 105 FWs), some of the FWs containusages of the EWe, which are also important to thesaurus.We have constructed a FN dictionary which includes FPand DW-EW relation information corresponding to the FP.3.
SYSTEM FOR EXTRACTING DW-EW (HIERARCHICAL) RELATIONThe system consists of the following four steps.RE~t ion  of EW and DS(a) Extraction of EW, its DS, the part of speech of theEW, the definition number of the DS from the dictionary.
(b) Transformation of the extracted DS to the ordinaryJapanese sentence's form(called the normalized DS).Because several contents(meanings) are thrown into one DSby means of parentheses or dot ' ' in the dictionary.~D Extraction of FE and DW-EW re l~ informationThe FW Dictionary is used.
(a) When DS dosen't include FW, DS is in TYPEI.
(b) When DS includes FW and conforms FP, DS is in TYPEII.
(c) When DS includes FW but doesn't conform FP or when DSincludes more than one FW, the DS is picked out as checkdata.Because it is d i f f i cu l t  to dist inguish between DW andFW or to extract DW-EW relat ion information mechanically.
(3) Extraction of DW and DW-HW relation informatio~A general word dictionary (containing about 75,000 nounwords)(S)is used, in which the character str ings of entrywords were arranged in inverse order (from right to le f t ) .DWs are basical ly extracted by means of longest matchingmethod, because there is ordinari ly no space between twoadjacent words in the Japanese sentence.
In addition tothis .
there are the following problems.
(a) The 'hiragana' notation is often used(e.g.
~O)~b\ [~b\ ]  ).
(b) The names of animals and plants are described by'katakana' (e.g.
~)P  \ [~\ ]  ).
(c) The unknown(compound) words are often used.
(d) In some cases, the DS containes more than one ON.The oxtructing procedure has to be constructed withregard to these ploblems.The relation information are also extracted, that is, 'DWisn't modified' and 'The number of DN are more than one' .When DN isn't extracted (that is,DR is neither 'katakana'string nor 'kanji' string nor any entry word in the worddictionary) from DS, the DS is picked out as check data.
(4) Decision of DW-EW relationAccording to the conditions above-mentioned, DW-EW rela-tions are decided.When extracted relation information is ambiguous, DS ispicked out as check data.PE T R SU TA pi lot  system has been implemented on FACOM M-360(Naga-saki University Computer Center) and FACON N-382(KyushuUniversity Computer Center) mostly by PL/I.The experimental input data(2,824 DSs) in the first step,arc the normalized DSs.Table 1 shows the number of input, output and check datain each step and the number of correct and incorrect  datain output data.Table 2 shows the extracted DW-EW re lat ions  and the num-ber of output data corresponding to the re la t ions .The experimental resu l t s  are as follows:(1) The rat io  of TYPEI (2,374) to output data(2 ,?
l l )  isabout 87.6%.
(2) The rat io  of TYPEI1(337) to output data(2,711) isabout 12.4%.
(3) The rat io  of output data(2,434) to input data(2,824)is about 85%.
(a) The rat io (ca l led  system precis ion) of correct outputdata(2,311) to output data(2,434) is  about 95 %.
(b) The rat io (ca l led  error rat io)  of incorrect outputdata(123) to output data(2,434) is about 5%.
(4) The rat io of check data(390) to input data(2,824) isabout 14%.Table 1(1) Extractionof FE(2) Extractionof DW(3) Decisionof RelationResult ofExperimentThe Number of Input Data, Output Dataand Check Data in Each StepINPUT OUTPUT DATADATA (correct:incorrect2,824 2,374(TYPE I )337(TYPE \[I )2,711 2,502(2,386: 116)2,386 2,318(2,311: 7)2,824 2,434(2,311: 123)CHECKDATA11320968390Table 2 DW-EW Relations and the Number of Output Datacorresponding to Each RelationRelatio\[DW: EWSubtotaTotalJ orrect Dubious IncorrectType Type Typei II I i II I i II1963 I 71 31 0o i io3 o i o4i II Oi Ioi 9 oi ioi io oi o2 1 0 ~!3.

(2) We have extracted automaticlly,DW<EW, DW~EW, DW~ EWin addition to DW>EW as the DW-EW relations.
(3) Input data not su i table for condit ions are picked outas check data in each step.
(4) There are a shortage of semantic information (e.g.lack of the adequate DW) in the dict ionary because ofassuming the human usage of the dictionary.We have been invest igat ing  the fol lowings.I .Development of a system for u t i l i z ing  the dict ionary (v) .II.Development of a system for h ierarch ica l ly  s t ructur ingamong entry words in the dictionary(~=).Ill.Development of a man-assisted system for construct inga pract ica l  s ized semantic d ict ionary (4).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTWe will l ike to thank the member of Turumaru's laborato-ry in Nagasaki University,  and in pat icular ,  Mr. A.Uchidaand Mr. K.Mizuno for the i r  e f fo r ts  of implementation.RE FEflENCES(1) S.Yokoyama: Preparation for the Data Management of aJapanese Dictionary, Bul.
