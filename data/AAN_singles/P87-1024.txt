On the Acquisition of Lexical Entries:The Perceptual Origin of Thematic RelationsJ ames  Puste jovskyDepartment of Computer ScienceBrandeis UniversityWaltham, MA 02254617-736-2709jamesp~br andeis.csnet-relayAbst rac tThis paper describes a computational model of conceptacquisition for natural language.
We develop a theoryof lexical semantics, the Eztended Aspect Calculus, whichtogether with a ~maxkedness theory" for thematic rela-tions, constrains what a possible word meaning can be.This is based on the supposition that predicates from theperceptual domain axe the primitives for more abstractrelations.
We then describe an implementation of thismodel, TULLY, which mirrors the stages of lexical acqui-sition for children.I.
In t roduct ionIn this paper we describe a computational model of con-cept acquisition for natural language making use of po-sitive-only data, modelled on a theory of lexical seman-tics.
This theory, the Eztende~t Aspect Calculus acts to-gether with a maxkedness theory for thematic roles toconstrain what a possible word type is, just as a gram-mar defines what a well-formed tree structure is in syntax.We argue that linguistic specific knowledge and learningprinciples are needed for concept acquisition from positiveevidence alone: Furthermore, this model posits a close in-teraction between the predicates of visual perception andthe early semantic interpretation f thematic roles as usedin linguistic expressions.
In fact, we claim that these re-lations act as constraints to the development of predicatehierachies in language acquisition.
Finally, we describeTULLY, an implementation f this model in ZETALXSPand discuss its design in the context of machine learningresearch.There has been little work on the acquisition ofthematic relation and case roles, due to the absence ofany consensus on their formal properties.
In this researchwe begin to address what a theory of thematic relationsmight look like, using learnabUity theory as a metric forevaluating the model.
We claim that there is an impor-tant relationship between visual or imagistic perceptionand the development of thematic relations in linguistic us-age for a child.
This has been argued recently by Jackend-off (1983, 1985) and was an assumption in the pioneeringwork of Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976).
Here we arguethat the conceptual abstraction of thematic informationdoes not develop arbitrarily but along a given, predictablepath; namely, a developmental path that starts with tan-gible perceptual predicates (e.g.
spatial, causative) tolater form the more abstract mental and cognitive predi-cates.
In this view thematic relations are actually sets ofthematic properties, related by a partial ordering.
Thiseffectively establishes a maxkedness theory for thematicroles that a learning system must adhere to in the acqui-sition of lexical entries for a larlguage.We will discuss two computational methods forconcept development in natural language:(1) F~ature Relaxation of particular features of the ar-guments to a verb.
This is performed by a con-straint propagation method.
(2) Thematic Decoupling of semantically incorporatedinformation from the verb.When these two learning techniques are combined withthe model of lexical semantics adopted here, the stagesof development for verb acquisition are similar to thoseacknowledged for child language acquisition.2.
Learnab i l l ty  Theory  and  Concept  De-ve lopmentWork in machine learning has shown the useful-ness to an inductive concept-learning system of inducing"bias" in the learning process (cf.
\[Mitchell 1977, 1978\],\[Michalski 1983\]).
An even more promising developmentis the move to base the bias on domain-intensive models,as seen in \[Mitchell et al 1985\], \[Utgoff 1985\], and \[Win-ston et al 1983 I.
This is an important direction for thoseconcerned with natural language acquisition, as it con-verges with a long-held belief of many psychologists andlinguists that domain-specific information is necessary forlearning (cf.
\[Slobin 1982\], \[Pinker 1984\], {Bowerman1974\], \[Chomsky 1980\]).
Indeed, Berwick (1984) moves inexactly this direction.
Berwick describes a model for theacquisition of syntactic knowledge based on a restrictedX-syntactic parser, a modification of the Marcus parser(\[Marcus 1980\]).
The domain knowledge specified to thesystem in this case is a parametric parser and learningsystem that adapts to a particular linguistic environment,given only positive data.
This is just the sort of biasingnecessary to account for data on syntactic acquisition.172One area of language acquisition that has not beensufficiently addressed within computational models is theacquisition of conceptual structure.
For language acquisi-tion, the problem can be stated as follows: How does thechild identify a particular thematic role with a specificgrammatical function in the sentence?
This is the prob-lem of mapping the semantic functions of a propositioninto specified syntactic positions in a sentence.Pinker (1984) makes an interesting suggestion (dueoriginally to D. Lebeaux) in answer to this question.
Heproposes that one of the strategies available to the lan-guage learner involves a sort of ~template matching" ofargument to syntactic position.
There are canonical con-j~gurat{orts that are the default mappings and non-cano-nicoJ mappings for the exceptions.
For example, the tem-plate consists of two rows, one of thematic roles, and theother of syntactic positions.
A canonical mapping existsif no lines joining the two rows cross.
Figure 1 shows acanonical mapping representing the sentence in (1), whileFigure 2 illustrates a noncanonical mapping representingsentence (2).0-roles: ~~LSyntactic roles: SUBJ OBJ OBLF igure  1e-roles: A Th G/S/LSyntactic r o ~ O  BLF igure  2(1) Mary hit Bill.
(2) Bill was hit by Mary.With this principle we can represent the productivity ofverb forms that are used but not heard by the child.
Wewill adopt a modified version of the canonical mappingstrategy for our system, and embed it within a theory ofhow perceptual primitives help derive linguistic concepts.As mentioned, one of the motivations for adopt-ing the canonical mapping principle is the power it givesa learning system in the face of positive-only data.
Interms of learnability theory, Berwick (1985) (following\[Angluin 1978\]) notes that to ensure successful acquisi-tion of the language after a finite number of positive ex-amples, something llke the Subset Principle is necessary.We can compare this principle to a Version Space modelof inductive learning( \[Mitchell 1977, 1978\]), with no neg-ative instances.
Generalization proceeds in a conservativefashion, taking only the narrowest concept that covers thedata.How does this principle relate to lexical seman-tics and the way thematic relations are mapped to syn-tactic positions?
We claim that the connection is verydirect.
Concept learning begins with spatial, temporal,and causal predicates being the most salient.
This followsfrom our supposition that these are innate structures, orare learned very early.
Following Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976), \[Miller 1985\], and most psychologists, weassume the prelinguistic child is already able to discernspatial orientations, causation, and temporal dependen-cies.
We take this as a point of departure for our theoryof markedness, which is developed in the next section.3.0 Theoretical Assumptions3.1 The  Extended Aspect Calcu lusIn this section we outline the semantic frameworkwhich defines our domain for lexical acquisition.
In thecurrent linguistic literature on case roles or thematic re-lations, there is little discussion on what logical connec-tion exists between one e-role and another.
Besides beingthe workhorse for motivating several principles of syn-tax (cf.
\[Chomsky 1981\], \[Willi~ms 1980\]) the most thatis claimed is that Universal Grammar  specifies a reper-toire of thematic relations (or case roles), Agent, Theme,Patient, Goal, Source, Instrument, and that every NPmust carry one and only one role.
It should be remem-bered, however, that thematic relations were originallyconceived in terms of the argument positions of seman-tic predicates uch as CAUSE and DO.
* That is a verbdidn't simply have a list of labelled arguments 2 such asAgent and Patient, but had an interpretation in terms ofmore primitive predicates where the notions Agent andPatient were defined.
The causer of an event (followingJackendoff (1976)) is defined as an Agent, for example,c ,4u s E(=, ,) - .
Ag,.~(=).Similarly, the first argument position of the pred-icate GO is interpreted as Theme, as in GO(=,y,z).
Thesecond argument here is the SOURCE and the third iscalled the GOAL.The model we have in mind acts to constrain thespace of possible word meanings.
In this sense it is similarto Dowty's aspect calculus but goes beyond it in embed-ding his model within a markedness theory for thematictypes.
Our model is a first-order logic that employs sym-bols acting as special operators over the standard logicalvocabulary.
These are taken from three distinct semanticfields.
They are: causal, spatial, and aspectual.The predicates associated with the causal field areCau~e, (C,), C~se~ (C2), and l.stru,ne.t (I).
The spatialfield has only one predicate, Locatiue, which is predicatedof an object we term the Th~me.
Finally, the aspectuali CfiJackendoff (1972, 1976) for a detailed elaboration ofthis theory.2 This is now roughly the common assumption in GB,GPSG, and LFG.173field has three predicates, representing the three temporalintervals t~, beginning, t2, middle, and t3, end.
From theinteraction of these predicates all thematic types can bederived.
We call the lexical specification for this aspectualand thematic information the Thematic Mapping Indez.As an example of how these components work to-gether to define a thematic type, consider first the dis-tinction between a state, an activity (or process), and anaccomplishment.
A state can be thought of as referenceto an unbounded interval, which we will simply call t2;that is, the state spans this interval.
3 An  activity or pro-tess can be thought of as referring to a designated initialpoint and the ensuing process; in other words, the situa-tion spans the two intervals tt and t2.
Finally, an eventcan be viewed as referring to both an activity and a des-ignated terminating interval; that is, the event spans allthree intervals, it, t2, and is,Now consider how these bindings interact with theother semantic fields for the verb run in sentence (8) andgive in sentence (9).
(8) John ran yesterday.
(9) John gave the book to Mary.We associate with the verb run an argument structure ofsimply rim(=}.
For give we associate the argument struc-ture ~v,(=, v, =).
The Thematic Mapping Index for each isgiven below in (10) and (11).00)L/!,(11)Tht ,!
)tt t 2The sentence in (8) represents a process with no logicalculmination, and the one argument is linked to the namedcase role, Theme.
The entire process is associated withboth the initial interval t~ and the middle interval t2.
Theargument = is linked to C~ as well, indicating that it isan Actor as well as a moving object (i.e.
Theme).
Thisrepresents one TMI  for an activity verb.The structure in (9) specifies that the meaning ofgive carries with it the supposition that there is a logicalThis is a simplication of our model, but for ourpurposes the difference is moot.
A state is actually inter-preted as a primitive homogeneous event-sequence, withdownward closure.

\[Pustejovsky, 1987\],4 \[Jacl~endoff tOSS\] develops a similar idea, but vide in/rafor discussion.culmination to the process of giving.
This is captured byreference to the final subinterval, is.
The linking between= and the L associated with tt is interpreted as Source,while the other linked arguments, y and z are Theme (thebook) and Goa/, respectively.
Furthermore, = is specifiedas a Causer and the object which is marked Theme is alsoan affected object (i.e.
Patient).
This will be one of theTMIs  for an accomplishment.In these examples the three subsystems are shownas rows, and the configuration given is lexically specified.43.2 A Markedness  Theory  for Themat ic  RolesAs mentioned above, the theory we are outlininghere is grounded on the supposition that all relations inthe language are suffiently described in terms of causal,spatial and aspectual predicates.
A thematic role in thisview is seen as a set of primitive properties relating to thepredicates mentioned above.
The relationship betweenthese thematic roles is a partial ordering over the sets ofproperties defining them.
It is this partial ordering thatallows us to define a markedness theory for thematic roles.Why is this important?If thematic roles are assigned randomly to a verb,then one would expect that there exist verbs that haveonly Patient or Instrument, or two Agents or Themes, forexample.
Yet this is not what we find.
What appears tobe the case is that thematic roles are not assigned to averb independently of one another, but rather that somethematic roles are fixed only after other roles have beenestablished.
For example, a verb will not be assigned aGOAL if there is not a THEME assigned first.
Similarly,a LOCATIVE is dependent on there being a THEMEpresent.
This dependency an be viewed as an acquisitionstrategy for learning the thematic relations of a verb.Now let us outline the theory.
We begin by estab-lishing the most unmarked relation that an argument canbear to its predicate.
Let us call this role Them,~.
Theonly semantic information this carries is that of an exis-tential quantifier.
It is the only named role outside of thethree interpretive systems defined above.
Normally, wethink of Them, as an object in motion.
This is only halfcorrect, however, since statives carry a Theme readings aswell.
It is in fact the feature \[?motion\] that distinguishesthe role of Mary in (1) and (2) below.
(1) Stative: l-motion I Mary sleeps.
(2) Active: \[+motion\] Mary fell.This gives us our first markedness convention:(3) Therr=ee--Theme.~/\[+motion\](3) Themery-..Themes/\[-motior=\]174where ThemeA is an "activity" Theme, and Themes is astative.Within the spatial subsystem, there is one variabletype, Location, and a finite set of them L1, L~... L~.
Themost unmarked location is that carrying no specific aspec-tual binding.
That is, the named variables are Ls and Lzand are commonly referred to as Source and Goal.
Thus,Lu is the unmarked role.
The limitations on named loca-tive variables i perhaps constrained only by the aspectualsystem of the language (rich aspectual distinction, thenmore named locative variables).
The markedness conven-tions here are:(4) Lu -* S/B(s) L~ -- C/EWithin the causal subsystem there are three pred-icates, Cl, C2, and I.
We call C2, (the traditional Patientrole) is less marked than c~, but is more marked than I.These conventions give us the core of the primitivesemantic relations.
To be able to perform predicate gen-eralization over each relation, however, we define a set offeatures that applies to each argument within the seman-tic subsystems.
These are the abstraction operators thatallow a perceptual-based semantics to generalize to non-perceptual relations.
These features also have markedand unmarked values, as we will show below.
There arefour features that contribute to the generalization processin concept acquisition:(a) l?~b,tra,t\] (b) \[+d~r,~t\](c) \[?,o,.pl,t,\] (d) \ [?.~i~t,\]The first feature, abttract, distinguishes tangibleobjects from intangible ones.
Direct will allow a gradi-ence in the notion of causation and motion.
The thirdfeature, cornplete, picks out the extension of an argumentas either an entire object or only part of it.
Ani~v~ac~l hasthe standard semantics of labeling an object as alive ornot.Let us illustrate how these operators abstract overprimitive thematic roles.
By changing the value of a fea-ture, we can alter the description, and hence, the set ofobjects in its extension.
Assume, for example, that thepredicate C1 has as its unmarked value, \[+Direct\].
(6) C,\[UDir,,tl --\[+Vir,ctlBy changing the value of this feature we allow CI, thedirect agent of an event, to refer to an indirect causer.
(7) Ae,.t\[+D~rect I <@ Aee,~tl-Dir,ct \]Similarly, we can change the value of the default settingfor the feature I+Complet~\] to refer to a subcausation (orcausation by part).
(8) Agent{+CompleU\] <~Agent\[-CompleteJThese changes define a new concept, "effector', which isa superset of the previous concepts given in the system.The same can be done with C'~ to arrive at the concept ofan "effected object."
We see the difference in interpreta-tion in the sentences below.a.
John intentionally broke the chair.
(Agent-direct)b. John accidentally broke that chair when he satdown.
(Agent-indirect)c. John broke the chair when he fell.
(Effector)Given the manner in which the features of primi-tive thematic roles are able to change their values, we aredefining a predictable generalization path that relationsincorporating these roles will take.
In other words, twoconcepts may be related thematically, but may have verydifferent extensional properties.
For example, give andtake are clearly definable perceptual transfer relations.But given the abstractions available from our marked-ness theory, they are thematically related to somethingas distant as "experiencer verbs", e.g.
please, as in "Thebook pleased John."
This relation is a transfer verb withan incorporated Theme; namely, the "pleasure."
sIf we apply these features in the spatial subsystem,we can arrive at generalized notions of location, as wellas abstracted interpretations for Theme, Goal and Source.For example, given the thematic role Th - A with the fea-ture \[-Abstract\] in the default setting, we can generalizeto allow for abstract relations such as like, where the ob-ject is not affected, but is an abstract Theme.
Similarly,the Theme in a sentence such as (a) can be concrete anddirect, or abstract, as in (b).
(a) have(L, rh) Mary has a book.
(b) have(L, Yh) Mary  has a problem with Bill.In conclusion, we can give the following dependencies be-tween thematic roles:{r~eme}{~} {s, c}{c,}s Cf.
Pustejovsky (1987) for an explanation of this termand a full discussion of the extended aspect calculus.175The generaliztion features apply to this structure to buildhierarchical structures (Cf.
{Keil 1979\], \[Kodratoff 1986\]).This partial ordering allows us to define a notion of cov-crs'ng, as with a semi-lattice, from which a strong princi-ple of functional uniqueness is derivable (of.
\[Jackendoff1985\]).
The mapping of a thematic role to an argumentfollows the following principle:(9) Max imal  Ass ignment Principle An  argumentwill receive the maximal interpretation consistentwith the data.This says two things.
First, it says that an Agent, forexample, will always have a location and theme role as-sociated with it.
Furthermore, an Agent may be affectedby its action, and hence be a Patient as well.
Secondly,this principle says that although an argument may bearmany thematic roles, the grammar picks out that functionwhich is mazimall!
; specific in its interpretation, accord-ing to the markedness theory.
Thus, the two argumentsmight be Themes in "John chased Mary", but the the-matic roles which maximally characterize their functionsin the sentence are A and P, respectively.4.
The  Learn ing  Component4.1 The  Form of the InputThe input is a data structure pair; an event se-quence expression and a sentence describing the event.The event-sequence is a simulated output from a middle-level vision system where motion detection from the low-level input has already been associated with particularobject types.
6The event-sequence consists of three instantaneousdescriptions (IDa) of a situation represented as intervals.These correspond to the intervals t~, t2, and ts in theaspect calculus.
The predicates are perceptual primi-tives, such as those described in Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) and Maddox and Pustejovsky (1987), suchas \[Ar(t~, ~) ~ ~ = \[O,V(,,, d t ,  ,4,,,,, .~t,(,,) ~, Mo,,,~(~,) ~, .

a sen-tence), parsed by a simple finite state transducer.
~s For a detailed discussion of how the visual processingand linguistic systems interact, cf.
Maddox and Pustejovsky(1987).We are not addressing any complex interaction betweensyntactic and semantic acquisition in this system.
Ideally, wewould like to integrate the concept acquisition mechanisms herewith a parser such as Berwick's, Cf.
Berwick 1985.4.2 The Acquisition ProcedureWe now turn to the design of the learning programitself.
TULLY  can be characterized as a domain-intensiveinductive learning system, where the generalizations pos-sible in the system are restricted by the architecture im-posed by the semantic model.
We can separate clearlywhat is given from what is learned in the system, as shownin Figure 1.GIVENExtended Aspect Calculus0-Markedness TheoryCanonical MappingRule Execution LoopACQUIREDVerbal Lexical semanticsArgument-function mappingPredication HierarchyFigure 1In order to better understand the learning mecha-nism, we will step through an example run of the system.First, however, we will give the rule execution loop whichthe system follows.Rule Execut ion  Loop1.

If this failsthen go to (4).4.
Invoke Noncanonical Mapping Principle.If (3) fails to build a mapping for the lexical item inthe input, then the rule INTERSECT is invoked.This allows the lines to cross from any of the in-terpretive levels to the argument tier.5.
Generalization Step.This is where the markedness theory is invoked.Induction follows the restrictions in the theory,where generalization is limited to one of the statedtypes.176Assume that the first input to the system is thesentence ~Mary hit the cat," with its accompanying eventsequence expression, represented as a situation calculusexpression.
INSTANTIATE attempts to map an exist-ing Thematic Mapping \[ndez onto the input, but fails.Stage (2) is entered by the failure of (1), and credit as-signment indicates where it failed.
Heuristics will indicatewhich thematic properties are associated with each argu-ment, and stage (3) links the arguments with the properroles, according to Canonical Mapping.
This links Maryto Agent and the cat to Patient.One important point to make here is that anyinformation from the perceptual expression that is notgrammatically expressed will automatically be assumedto be part of the verb meaning itself.
In this case, theinstrument of the hitting (e.g.
Mary's arm) is covered bythe lexical semantics of hit.There are two forms of generalization performedby the system in step (5): constraint propagation andthematic decoupling.
In a propagation procedure (Cf.\[Waltz, 1975\]), the computation is described as operat-ing locall!/, since the change has local consistency.
Toillustrate, consider the verb entry for have, as in (1),(I) John has a book.
have(z =/;, y = Th)where the object carries the feature \[-abstract\].
Now, con-sider how the sense of the verb changes with a featurechange to \[~abetract\], as in (2).
(2) John has an idea.In other words, there is a propagation of this feature tothe subject, where the sense of locative becomes moreabstract, e.g.
menta/.
These types of extensions give riseto other verbs with the same thematic mapping, but with~relaxed" interpretations.
*The other strategy employed here is that of the-matic decoupling, where thematic information becomesdisassociated from the lexical semantics for a verb.
'The narrower interpretation of a verb's meaning will bearrived at after enough training instances are given; forexample, from cut as meaning a particular action with aknife, to cut as an action that results in a certain state.It is interesting to speculate on how these strate-gies facilitate the development from perceptual relationsto more abstract ones.
The verb tell, for example, can beviewed as a transfer verb with a \[+abstract\] Theme, and theaccompanying contraint propagation (Cf.
\[Pinker, 1984\]and \[Jackendoff, 1983\]).
Similarly, experiencer verbs suchas please, upset, and anger can be seen as combining bothstrategies: they are similar to transfer verbs, but with lea-s For further discussion of constraint propagation asa learning strategy, cf.

Specifi-cally, we argue that perceptual predicates form the foun-dation for later conceptual development in language, andpropose a specific algorithm for learning employing a the-ory of markedness for thematic types and the two strate-gies of thematic decoupling and constraint relazation andpropagation.
The approach sketched above will doubtlessneed revision and refinement on particular points, but isclaimed to offer a new perspective which can contribute tothe solution of some long-standing puzzles in acquisition.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Sabine Bergler who did thefirst implementation of the algorithm, as well as AnthonyMaddox, John Brolio, Ken Wexler, Mellissa Bowermxn,and Edwin Williams for useful discussion.
