LAW VIII - The 8th Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 29?37,Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24 2014.Aligning Chinese-English Parallel Parse Trees: Is it Feasible?Dun Deng and Nianwen XueComputer Science Department, Brandeis University415 South Street, Waltham MA, USAddeng@brandeis.edu, xuen@brandeis.eduAbstractWe investigate the feasibility of aligning Chinese and English parse trees by examining cases ofincompatibility between Chinese-English parallel parse trees.
This work is done in the context ofan annotation project wherewe construct a parallel treebank by doingword and phrase alignmentssimultaneously.
We discuss the most common incompatibility patterns identified within VPs andNPs and show that most cases of incompatibility are caused by divergent syntactic annotationstandards rather than inherent cross-linguistic differences in language itself.
This suggests that inprinciple it is feasible to align the parallel parse trees with somemodification of existing syntacticannotation guidelines.
We believe this has implications for the use of parallel parse trees as animportant resource for Machine Translation models.1 IntroductionParallel treebanks have been proved to be a valuable resource inMachine Translation research (Gildea,2003; Liu et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Chiang, 2010; Xiao and Zhu, 2013), but one issue that hamperstheir utility is the incompatibility between the syntactic parse trees for a sentence pair (Chiang, 2010), asthe trees are annotated based on independently developed monolingual syntactic annotation standards.For example, even though the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and English TreeBank (Marcuset al., 1993) are often referred to collectively as the Penn series of treebanks and are both annotatedwith phrase structure trees in very similar annotation frameworks, different annotation decisions haveled to divergent tree structures (Chiang, 2010).
The purpose of this study is to investigate to what extentthe divergences between Chinese-English parallel parse trees are caused by different annotation styles(and therefore can be avoided by revising the annotation guidelines), and to what extent they are causedby cross-linguistic differences inherent in language.
The answer to this question would shed light onwhether it is possible to align the parse trees in parallel treebanks, and on the feasibility of buildingMachine Translation systems based on these aligned parallel treebanks.The question above cannot be answered without first having a concrete alignment specification andknowing what types of alignments are attempted.
No incompatibility issue would arise for sentence-levelalignment when sentences are aligned as a whole.
By contrast, both word-level alignment (or the align-ment of terminal nodes) and phrase-level alignment (or the alignment of non-terminal nodes) interactwith syntactic structures, which could potentially cause incompatibility between the alignments and thetree structures.
In the next section, we outline an alignment approach where we perform word alignmentsand phrase alignments simultaneously in a parallel Chinese-English treebank to prevent incompatibili-ties between word alignments and syntactic structures.
The alignment approach alone, however, doesnot prevent incompatibilities between the two parse trees of a sentence pair, which are either due to in-herent cross-linguistic divergences or differences in treebank annotation styles.

We analyze two of them and show how they make certain phrase alignmentsimpossible.
In Section 4, we discuss the third and also the most common type of incompatibility, whichis caused by different annotation decisions as specified in the Penn Chinese and English Treebank syn-tactic bracketing guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000; Bies et al., 1995).
We propose modifications to thetree structures for the purpose of aligning the parse trees, which means that proper phrase alignment ispossible if certain common patterns of incompatibility in syntactic parse trees are fixed.
We concludeour paper in Section 5 and touch on the workshop theme.
We argue that the quality and level of linguisticsophistication of an linguistic annotation project is tied to the purpose of the resource, and how it is goingto be used.2 Overview of the HACEPT ProjectThe purpose of the HACEPT (Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel TreeBank) Project isto perform word-level and phrase-level alignments between parallel parse trees to develop a linguistic re-source for Machine Translation models.
We are currently in the process of aligning about 9,000 sentencepairs where syntactic parses already exist for sentences on both the Chinese and English side.In our project, the annotator is presented with a pair of parallel Chinese-English sentences which haveparse trees.
The task of the annotator is to do both word and phrase alignments between the two parsetrees.
The reason for doing word alignments and phrase alignments simultaneously is to make sure wordalignments and syntactic structures are harmonized to avoid both redundancies and incompatibilities.Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the point.A big challenge to word alignment comes from language-particular function words that do not havecounterparts in the translation language.
Take the sentences in Figure 1 for instance, the Chinese pre-nominal modification marker?
has no English counterpart.
Similarly, the English infinitive marker tohas no Chinese counterpart.
Word alignments done without taking syntactic structures into considera-tion generally glue a function word such as?
and to here to a neighboring content word which has acounterpart and align the two words together to the counterpart of the content word (Li et al., 2009).Under this practice, the first?
will be glued to?
?/country, and the two words??/country?
as awhole will be aligned to countries.
Similarly, to will be glued to weigh in and the whole string to weighin will be aligned to ?
?/weigh in.
In our project, we take a different approach to word alignments:we leave all the words without a counterpart unaligned on the word level and mark them as "extra".
Foreach unaligned word, we locate the appropriate phrase which contains the unaligned word and has aphrasal counterpart on the other side.
By aligning the two phrases, the unaligned word is captured in itsappropriate context.
Under this new strategy, the Chinese?
and the English to are both left unalignedon the word level.
For?, we align the NP??/all??/country??
?/people with the NP peoplein all countries, because the Chinese NP is the relevant context where?
appears (?
is used in the NPto indicate that??/all?
?/country is the modifier of the noun?
?/people) and matches in meaningwith the English NP.
For to, we align the VP use their own methods of expression to weigh in on thiswiththe VP??/use??/own???/expression??/method?
?/weigh in?/this?/thing, because tois used in the English VP to connect use their own methods of expression and weigh in on this and alsobecause the English VP and the Chinese one matches in meaning.Under our approach, word alignments and syntactic structures are harmonized, and both redundanciesand incompatibilities between the two are avoided.
For example, the phrase alignment between thetwo NPs??/all??/country??
?/people and people in all countries specifies the context for theoccurrence of the function word ?.
There is no need to glue ?
to the previous noun ?
?/countryon the word level.
As a matter of fact, the host of ?
(namely the modifier signaled by it) is not thenoun ?
?/country but the NP ?
?/all ??/country.
Similarly, the phrase alignment between usetheir own methods of expression to weigh in on this and ?
?/use ?
?/own ?
?
?/expression ??/method?
?/weigh in?/this?/thing captures the syntactic environment in which to appears.
Thephrase alignment also avoids an incompatibility issue caused by attaching to to weigh in and aligning the30.IP..VP..VP..VP..VP..NP..NN.?..DP.DT.?..VV.??..VP..NP..NP..NN.??..NN.??..DNP..DEG.?.NP.PN.??.VV.??..VV.??..ADVP.AD.?..NP..NP.NN.??.DNP..DEG.?.NP..NN.??.DT.?

For a morecomprehensive and detailed description of the HACEPT project, see (Deng and Xue, 2014).A natural question arises for our approach: cross-linguistic divergences between languages may causeparse tree incompatibilities to arise, which calls into question the possibility of doing phrase alignmentsto a useful extent.
The fact is that we did find incompatibilities between parse trees in our annotation.
Inthe next section, we report three types of parse tree incompatibilities we have encountered.3 Three types of parse tree incompatibilitiesDuring the annotation process, we encountered three types of parse tree incompatibilities that makesome phrase alignments impossible.
The three types are distinguished by the sources of their occurrenceand are listed below:Three types of incompatibilities between parallel parse trees:a. Incompatibilities caused by lexical-semantic differences between the two languagesb.
Incompatibilities caused by translation-related reasonsc.
Incompatibilities caused by different annotation standardsLet us look at the first type.
On the lexical level, languages differ in terms of whether or not a pieceof semantic information is encoded in a lexical item.
For instance, Chinese does not have a verb that ex-presses the meaning of the English verb prioritize, which needs to be translated using a phrase.
This doesnot necessarily cause problems for phrase alignments.
Taking prioritize for instance, the English phraseprioritize transportation projects is translated as ?
?/arrange ?
?/transportation ?
?/project ?
?
?/priority ?
?/order (literally arrange transportation projects' priority order, i.e., prioritize trans-portation projects).
Note that a phrase alignment can be made between the two VPs and also the twoNPs transportation projects and ?
?/transportation ?
?/project despite the fact that the meaning ofprioritize is expressed by a discontinuous phrase in Chinese (?
?/arrange ????/priority?
?/or-der, i.e., arrange the priority order of ...).
The most extreme case in this category which usually causesincompatibilities and makes phrase-level alignment impossible is idiomatic expressions.
An idiom isa single lexical item just like a word and its meaning generally has to be expressed literally in anotherlanguage.
For instance, the idiomatic part in Markets function best so long as no one has a finger onthe scale is translated as (?
?/so long as)??/everyone??/justly?
?/act (??/market?
?/func-tion?/most?/good), which literally is everyone justly acts.
The parse tree for both the English idiomand its Chinese translation is given in Figure 2.
No phrase alignment is possible between the idiom andits translation except that between the two root nodes that dominate each string.
Phrase alignments arereduced to a minimal extent in cases like this.Now let us discuss the second type.
Consider this example, where the Chinese sentence?/he??/not?
?/mention?/this?/one?/point (He did't mention this point) is translated as There was no mentionmade of this by him.
Given this particular translation, it is impossible to make a phrase alignment betweenthe Chinese VP??/not?
?/mention?/this?/one?/point and no mention made of this althoughthe two strings match in meaning.
This is because, as shown in Figure 3, the NP node that dominatesthe English string also dominates the PP by him.
Note that him in the PP corresponds to?/he, whichis outside the Chinese VP.
The issue here is caused by the translation.
Note that the Chinese sentence isin active voice, but the given translation is in passive voice, which is why the PP by him appears at theend of the sentence and causes the problem.
If the more literal translation He didn't mention this pointwere provided,??/not?
?/mention?/this?/one?/point could be aligned with didn't mention thispoint, and?
?/mention?/this?/one?/point could be aligned with mention this point, which is alsoimpossible with the given translation.
Phrase alignments are reduced by some extent in cases like this.For the first two types of incompatibilities already discussed, the negative impact of them on phrasealignments can be reduced by the enlargement of the corpus, which currently has 8, 932 sentence pairs.32.CP..IP..VP..VP.VV.??/act..ADVP.AD.??/justly..NP.PN.??/everyone..ADVP.CS.?

XP = {PP, ADVP, S}Idioms which make phrase-level alignment impossible are rare in our corpus.
On average, there are about5 cases in a file of 500 sentence pairs.
As for the incompatibilities caused by translation, it is possiblefor the phrase alignments missed in those cases to be made up if the phrases involved reappear in a moreliteral translation.
These two issues do not pose a real threat to our approach.
As annotators, we cannotdo much about these two issues, especially the latter one, since our data is got as is.
Due to these tworeasons, we will not discuss them further in this paper.Next let us turn to the last type of incompatibility.
Use the sentence pair in Figure 1 for instance.
Notethat the Chinese VP ?
?/use ?
?/own ?
?
?/expression ?
?/method matches the English stringuse their own methods of expression in terms of both grammaticality and meaning.
However, the Englishparse tree has no phrasal node for the string that could form an alignment to the Chinese VP.
Similarly,the Chinese NP??/expression?
?/method corresponds to the English string methods of expression,but again, no phrasal node is present in the English parse tree that could be aligned with the Chinese NP.Our statistics shows that, in a file with 500 sentence pairs, there are approximately 50 instances of theincompatibility in VPs illustrated here and 20 in NPs (an instance is a case where a legitimate phrasealignment cannot be made).
These are both quite high frequency.
In the next section, we discuss thereason for the incompatibility and give a solution to fix the issue.4 A common incompatibility pattern and its solutionThere is a pattern for the incompatibility illustrated at the end of Section 3.
The cause for the incom-patibility is the bracketing annotation of the complement-adjunct distinction made by the Penn Treebank(PTB) bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995).
The pattern is found in both VPs and NPs.Let us discuss VPs first.
To see the pattern, we need some background information about the internalcomposition of both English and Chinese VPs and how VPs are parsed according to PTB and CTBannotation standards.
Let us start with the English VP.
Besides the verb, there can be both preverbal andpostverbal constituents in an English VP.
Preverbal constituents are much more restricted than postverbalconstituents in terms of both phrase types and the number of constituents allowed.
Most commonlyseen in our corpus, an ADVP is present before the verb if there is a preverbal constituent at all.
Bycontrast, various kinds of constituents (NP, PP, ADVP, S) can appear post-verbally and more than oneof these phrases can co-occur.
When there is more than one post-verbal constituent, quite often one ofthem is the complement of the verb and the others are adjuncts.
Due to engineering considerations, thePTB bracketing guidelines decided on a flat structure for the English VP, where preverbal and postverbalconstituents and the verb are treated as sisters that are directly attached to the VP-node (Bies et al., 1995).A general structure for the English VP is given in Figure 4a, where it can be seen that the complement-adjunct distinction is not made.Now let us turn to the Chinese VP.
In a Chinese VP, there can also be both preverbal and postver-bal constituents, but the situation is quite different from that in English.
Unlike in English VPs wherepostverbal constituents are freer, postverbal constituents in Chinese VPs are restricted and can only be34the complement of the verb or one particular kind of phrase, namely QP, which includes counting phrasessuch as three times as in went there three times, and duration phrases such as for three years as in livedthere for three years.
Adjuncts including ADVP, PP, and different kinds of adverbial clauses come be-fore the verb.
The second difference is that Chinese strongly favors no more than one constituent afterthe verb.
In theory, a complement phrase and a QP can co-occur after the verb, but in reality, if the twoco-occur in a sentence, the complement will most likely be preposed to the left of the verb by eithertopicalization or the introduction of the function word?, leaving QP the only post-verbal element.
Thestructure of a Chinese VP stipulated by the CTB bracketing standards (Xue and Xia, 2000) is providedin Figure 4b.Now let us compare the two structures in Figure 4.
Note that in the English VP there is no phrasal nodethat dominates the verb and its immediate sister on the right, which, in many cases, is the complement ofthe verb.
By contrast, there is a node in the Chinese VP (the boxed VP) that groups together the verb anda post-verbal constituent, which could be either the complement or a QP (some QPs are complements andsome others are adjuncts, an issue that does not need to bother us here).
This is where the incompatibilityarises: the boxed VP-node in the Chinese tree has no node-counterpart to align with in the English tree,but the string dominated by that boxed VP has a match in the English sentence.
The example in Figure 1illustrates the issue, where the Chinese VP dominating the string??/use??/own???/expression?
?/method has no possible phrase alignment although the string corresponds in meaning to the Englishstring use their own methods of expression.To eliminate the incompatibility, an extra layer of projection is needed in the English tree.
To bespecific, we need to combine the verb and its complement to create a VP node, which then can be alignedto the boxed VP in the Chinese tree.
Still using the example in Figure 1 for instance, we need to create aVP node by combining the English verb use and its object NP their own methods of expression, so thatthe Chinese VP??/use??/own???/expression?
?/method can be aligned with the resultantVP.
This can be done through binarization.Now let us turn to the pattern in NPs.
We will look at the English NP first.
There can be constituentsboth before and after the head in an English NP.
Post-nominal constituents can be either a PP or an Swhereas pre-nominal constituents can be one or more than one of the following kinds of elements: deter-miners (the/a/an), demonstratives (this/that etc.
), quantifiers (some, many etc.
), numerals and adjectives.The PTB bracketing guidelines make the decision that all pre-nominal elements and the head be groupedtogether using a flat structure to form a NP, which then is treated as a sister of a post-nominal constituent,be it a complement or an adjunct.
As for the Chinese NP, the major difference between a Chinese NPand an English one is that there can only be pre-nominal constituents in Chinese NPs.
In other words,the head noun is the rightmost element in a Chinese NP and nothing comes after it.The incompatibility has to do with the complement-adjunct distinction.
The complement of an Englishnoun can be either a PP or an S, which always comes after the noun.
Due to space limit, we only discussPP below.
An English noun and its PP complement, because of the close semantic relationship betweenthe two, are usually translated as a compound noun in Chinese.
For instance, student of linguistics istranslated as the N-N compound???/linguistics??/student.
A compound is treated by the CTBbracketing standard as an NP dominating all its components.
Unfortunately, the English head noun andits complement do not form a constituent, which, if present, can be aligned with the node for the Chinesecompound.
This causes incompatibility to arise.
Take Figure 1 for instance, the English string methodsof expression is translated as the Chinese compound noun??/expression??/method.
As shown bythe structure, the noun method and its PP complement do not form a constituent.
As a result, the Chinesecompound noun has no alignment.To remove the incompatibility, we need to change the existing structure of the English NP.
Still usingthe example in Figure 1 for instance, if the English noun phrase has the structure in Figure 5, then we canalign the English NP methods of expression with the Chinese NP ?
?/expression ??/method.
Thestructure in Figure 5 is different from what is given by the PTB standards in that the head noun (such as35.NP..PP..NP.NN.expression..IN.of..NP..NN.method.JJ.own.DT.their(a) Current structure.NP..NP..PP..NP.NN.expression..IN.of..NN.method..JJ.own.DT.their(b) Proposed new structureFigure 5: A proposed revision for the existing structure of English NPsmethod) is combined with its complement (such as the PP of expression) first to create an NP, which thenis modified by, say, an adjective (such as own) and a determiner (such as their).
From the semantic pointof view, a pre-nominal adjective is an adjunct to the head noun that is not as closely related to the headnoun as its complement.
The new structure given in Figure 5b reflects this semantic fact by combiningthe complement with the head before the adjective.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we argue that it is feasible to align Chinese-English parallel parse trees despite incompat-ibility issues.
We show that the most common incompatibility is caused by bracketing guideline design,which can be fixed by changing the existing structures stipulated by the current annotation standards.The revised structures we proposed to avoid the incompatibility are deeper than the existing PTB struc-tures and respect the complement-adjunct distinction, which is a well-established notion in linguisticsthat has been shown to manifest itself in different kinds of phenomena cross-linguistically.
In syntax, thedistinction is made by combining the head and its complement first to form a constituent, which then iscombined with an adjunct.
This way of representing the distinction is standard and gives arise to a struc-ture that is binary-branching and deep.
In syntactic annotation, linguistic sophistication which requiresthe parse tree to reflect well-established linguistic notions such as the complement-adjunct distinction isan important consideration and generally gives arise to deeper structures.
In addition to linguistic sophis-tication, another important consideration in syntactic annotation is engineering economy, which requiresthe annotation to be economical in the sense that it can be carried out in a convenient and efficient mannerto save annotation effort and time.
This means that the parse tree needs to be as flat as possible since shal-low structures are much easier to annotate than deep ones.
These two competing considerations interactto influence the establishment of bracketing standards.Due to engineering pressure caused by the fact that it is not easy to make a consistent distinctionbetween complements and adjuncts in annotation, the PTB bracketing guidelines chose a shallow struc-ture for both VPs and NPs as shown above.
The decision is understandable since no incompatibilityever arises in the construction of a monolingual treebank like PTB.
With the advent of new use cases ofmonolingual treebanks such as hierarchically aligned parallel treebanks, new issues like incompatibilityemerge and call for adjustments to some decisions that have been made without such issues.
As shownin Section 4, some decisions made in existing bracketing annotation cause incompatibilities and makelegitimate phrase alignments impossible.
For the purpose of aligning parallel parse trees, deeper and lin-guistically motivated structures are needed.
This raises the interesting question whether we should havea deeper and linguistically motivated structure to start with when constructing a monolingual treebank.Based on what we have seen in this paper, a positive answer to the question seems reasonable at leastin some cases such as VPs and NPs for the sake of better serving uses cases like constructing parallel36treebanks with hierarchical alignments.AcknowledgementsThe HACEPT project, under which the work presented in this paper is done, is supported by the IBMsubcontract No.
