It was built on the remains of Med-stract, a previously created resource that in-cluded a bio-relation server and an acronymdatabase.
MedstractPlus uses simple and scal-able natural language processing modules tostructure text and is designed with reusabilityand extendibility in mind.1 IntroductionIn the late 1990s, the Medstract project (Pustejovskyet al, 2002) set out to use common Natural Lan-guage Processing techniques and employ them toaccess relational information in Medline abstracts.Medstract used a set of pipelined Python scriptswhere all scripts operated on in-memory objects.The output of this pipeline was a set of relations,indexed by the PubMed identifier of the abstract inwhich they appeared.
A Perl script proposed poten-tial acronyms using a set of regular expressions onnamed entities in Medline abstracts.
Both relationsand acronyms were fed into an Oracle database,where access to these datasources was enabled bya set of Perl CGI scripts.
The code, however, wasnot made public and was not maintained in any se-rious fashion after 2004.
Developers of the systemdispersed over the world and the Medstract serverfatally crashed in 2007.Here, we describe the resurrection of Medstract.One goal was that code should be open source andthat installation should not depend on idiosyncra-cies of the developer?s machine, which was a prob-lem with the inherited code base.
Reusability andextendability are ensured by following the princi-ples embodied in the Linguistic Annotation Format(LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2006).
In LAF, source dataare untouched, annotations are grouped in layers thatcan refer to each other and to the source, and eachlayer is required to be mappable to a graph-like pivotformat.
For MedstractPlus, each component is setup to be independent from other layers, although ofcourse each layer may need access to certain typesof information in order to create non-trivial output.This allows us to swap in alternative modules, mak-ing it easier to experiment with different versions ofthe tagger and chunker for example.
We now pro-ceed to describe the system in section 2 and finishwith the current status and future work in section 3.2 System Design and ImplementationThe general design of MedstractPlus is presented inFigure 1.
The Lemmatizer creates what LAF callsthe base-segmentation, a first layer of tokenized textthat is the input to processing modules associatedwith other layers.
The Lemmatizer incorporates aPython version of the Brill Tagger, extended withentries from the UMLS Thesaurus.The Semantic Tagger is a group of componentsusing (i) regular expressions for finding simple typeslike URLs, (ii) dictionary lookup in the UMLS typeand concept lists as well as other typed word lists,(iii) off-the-shelf components like the Abner genetagger (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/ bsettles/abner/) and(iv) a statistical disambiguation model for genestrained on the GENIA corpus.184Medline Abstracts LemmatizerGENIA CorpusAcronymsUMLSRelationsSemantic TypesSemantic Tagger- regular expressions- dictionary lookup- Abner tagger- disambiguationRelation Extraction- shallow parserthree-level YACC parser- argument linkerWeb InterfacePubMedFigure 1: Overview of the MedstractPlus ArchitectureThe Relation Extraction component now containsa three-level 59-rule YACC parser that, starting withsimple low-level chunking of noun and verb groups,proceeds to add more complex noun phrases andsubordinated phrases.
The argument linker producesbinary relations, using a finite-state machine thatruns on the data created by the shallow parser.An advantage of this data-driven approach is thatprocessing can be split up.
A complete run of Med-stractPlus on all Medline abstracts would take ap-proximately 30 days on a entry-level desktop.
Butsome relatively stable components like the Lemma-tizer and the shallow parser (the latter being the mosttime-consuming component) can be run just onceand subsequent runs can be restricted to those com-ponents that were changed.The Web Interface gives access to the types andrelations in a fairly standard way.
In its current pro-totype form, it allows a user to type in a gene andthen view all relations that the gene participates in.Alternatively, a pair of genes can be given.3 Current Status and Future WorkThe basic architecture depicted in Figure 1 is inplace, but some components like the type disam-biguator are in embryonic form.
The web inter-face and the source code are or will be available athttp://medstractplus.org.Extensive additions to the basic typing and re-lation extraction component groups are in progressand the Relation Extraction component can be ex-tended with specialized rule sets for specific rela-tions like inhibit or phosphorylate.
The interactionwith the PubMed server is now limited to providinglinks.
But the plan is that the MedstractPlus serverwill also query PubMed for relation pairs in case itsown database provides little information.
This ap-proach can be extended to other relation servers likeChilibot (http://www.chilibot.net/), thereby movingtowards a system than presents merged relationsfrom the MedstractPlus database as well as relationsfrom other servers.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Institutesof Health, under grant number 5R01NS057484-04.ReferencesNancy Ide and Laurent Romary.
