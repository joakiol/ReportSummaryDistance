28040 Madrid - Spain{felisa,julio,anselmo} @ ieec.uned.esAbstractA computer-based course addressing thetopic of" applying Natural Languageresources and techniques to InformationRetrieval is presented.
The courseprovides several Internet on-lineresources to support a learning by doingapproach in a real world context.Rationale for the design of the course ispresented and a detailed description ofthe course structure and content is given.1 IntroductionThere are two traditional distinctions in highereducation that are currently on a period of bigdebate.
The first one concerns industrial trainingvs higher education objectives, the second one isrelated to the role of emerging technologies fordistance learning, potentially blurring the untilnow clear separation between conventionaluniversities and distance learning Institutions.Changes in both Education and Trainingcontexts are moving closer their previouslyseparate objectives.
On one hand, there is muchconcern about bringing educational curriculamore in line with vocational needs.
In a varietyof disciplines, higher education courses arebecoming oriented to professionally recognizedqualifications, adopting approaches to integratepractice in context.
On the other hand, industrialorganizations are looking for a more versatileway of building personal profiles to adaptindividuals to the changing needs of theirorganizations.
Thus, acquiring more generalskill is been increasingly addressed for advancedtraining purposes.Distance learning Universities are operatingsince the seventies.
Most of them were based onthe industrial model characterized by theproduction of highly effective learning materialsfor independent s udy and the use of "one-way"media, such as print, video, radio or TVbroadcasting.
While in traditional education thecost of education depends on the number ofstudents involved, this is not the case with theindustrial distance education model.
The costdepends on a fixed part for the preparation ofmaterials with less investment in academic stafffor tutoring tasks.
A clear improvement of usingnew technology for this model has been thedelivery of course materials through CD-ROM,and later on through the Internet.
Computer-based materials can integrate presentations withsimulations, problem solving tools, virtuallaboratories and the like, to engage students in aprocess of active learning.
More controversialis the embedding of human-human i teractivetechnologies.
It is an open challenge to find newways of satisfying increasing interactionbetween students and tutors when staffresources remain scarce.
Peer collaboration is anidea to explore, but as it is the case in manyindustrial organizations collaborative behaviordoes not happen spontaneously just because thetechnology is available, but rather is a shift ofculture to be established.The virtual campus \[1\] is a metaphor currentlydeserving a lot of attention.
It is sometimespresented as a bridge for conventionaluniversities tO extend their scope to reachdistance learners, sometimes as an opportunityfor distance learning institutions to provide anenvironment combining the strength ofsystematic teaching with elaborated materials tosupport more!efficiently distance study.
Butmetaphors hould be carefully contrasted withthe demand side perspective to foresee whethertechnology-baged distance teaching can succeed.For example, 'there is, despite the quite shorthistory of desl~top computer conferencing, somefailed pilot experiences in real-time multipointteleteaching.
The cost of equipment was a well-known factor,, but another very practical issuewas often neglected: real distance students arein fact fully reluctant o participate regularly insynchronous events, with a fixed schedule.
Theexisting technology has demonstrated to bepowerful.
Payilng due regard to usability issuesin order to realize its potential for learningpurposes remains an open question.Over the last decade the European Commissionhas launched a variety of programs to encourageinternational partnership and cooperation in thefield of education and training.
Some of theprograms aimed at analyzing the currentsituation to recommend future action.
Otherswere projects trongly technology oriented todevelop platforms and environments speciallyfocused on distance and flexible learning.
Inaddition, a Set of pilot experiences andapplications were also implemented.Within the :SOCRATES framework \[2\],ACO*HUM \[3\] is a thematic network includinga working group on Computational linguisticsand language ngineering.
A plan for developingopen distance learning pilot courses wasproposed in cooperation with ELSNET \[4\], andfinally a proposal including six pilots waslaunched in February 98.
We have developedone of them, on the topic of InformationRetrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) \[5\].This topic is!
especially well suited for alearning-by-doing web course.
The Internetitself is the biggest IR testbed, and the websearch engines are the most powerfulapplications of IR techniques.
The students canbe guided through on-line NLP software tomanipulate, expand, translate queries, etc., andget first hand impressions on the utility of suchprocesses.Next section discusses our approach while adetailed presentation is given in section three.2 Approach and aimsThe approach for developing our project hasbeen to capture the experience of designingmaterials from the distance teaching tradition,while embracing two principles of recentlearning theories in the support of botheducation and training: (i) learning by doing,and (ii) situated learning.
The first addresseshow to acquire knowledge \[6\] and the latterhighlights the ability to deploy knowledge inreal world context \[7\].
Some of the assumptionswe consider follows:A first essential component of our approach is toprovide structured access to a set of tools andlearning resources, both internal and external tothe site.In order to deploy the strategy of learning-by-doing, students are required to perform tasks foreach main issue.
These tasks are designed toencourage lots of practical work situating thelearning experience as close to the real world aspossible.A second component is to help the learner to beintroduced in a professional community.
In thisrespect we would pay special attention toestablish for all actors (researchers, teachers,professionals and students) concrete ways tocollaborate fruitfully in the evolution andupdating of the product.
This is a quiteimportant aspect in an emerging field wherechanges come quite rapidly.A third component is to enable the learner ortrainee to became engaged in a learningcommunity, breaking the feeling of beingisolated.
Social support and participationimprove learners' motivation: facilities forshared virtual spaces and personalcommunication would be included.A fourth component relates to our strongendorsement of the role of collaboration.
Aculture of collaboration eeds to be developed.To explore the potential of group learning wewould provide means for developingcollaborative activities using asynchronoustechnology.
This would be applicable incontexts where stable small groups of learnerscould be organized.Based on the above argumentation the projectaims are listed below:?
To develop a computer-based course?
addressing the topic of applying NaturalLanguage resources and techniques toInformation Retrieval or, to be moreaccurate, Text Retrieval, dealing withmultilinguality issues.?
providing or assembling Internet on-line resources that permit a practicalexperimentation f the issues consideredin the course.
Such facilities can be in-site software, including: Stemmers,Morphological Analysers, Part ofSpeech Taggers for different languages,Multilingual Lexical Databases, Cross-Language Mapping of Queries orexternal, public domain resources uchas Internet Retrieval Engines, MachineTranslation Systems, etc.?
To design a structured web-based site?
allowing single learning on-line mode,and asynchronous collaboration mode?
offering guidelines to supportindependent learners?
providing an interface to facilitateflexible access to the content matter andthe rest of the tools and resources?
To involve colleagues in contributing tocurrent and further development of theprototypeThe remaining sections of the paper describehow the background ideas have been articulatedand embedded in the design of the prototype,further testing with users, as well as the internalevaluation and dissemination plan.3 Key features of the IR-NLPweb site.Figure 1 shows the Web Site Homepage.
Thelayout is homogeneous through the site: on theleft appears the set of available options, on theright the contents for the selected function.There are two different menus: one for theHomepage, the other for the Contents of thecourse.The Homepage menu (see figure 1) offersGeneral Information and CommunicationServices, and provide access to the contents ofthe course.
General Information is structured infive sections: Using this site, Introduction,Syllabus outline, Requirements and Study Guide.As an example, Introduction gives answers tothe following questions: (i) What is this courseabout?
(ii) What will you not find here?
(iii) Inwhich ways can the site be exploited forlearning purposes?
Communication servicesintegrate e-mail facilities with a directory ofcontacts.
In addition, News will be providedhere.
It also holds room for a Frequently-Asked-Questions list where answers to commonproblems related to the course will be build andenriched with the contribution of users.The Contents button provides access to the mainpage of the course.
The Contents menu (seeFigure 3) contains the following functions:I ~ i~, I~ tl ' f i '"= '=';'m "~ i "  'lfll'lVile ECt vmw ~ Com~lcalc~r "NLP & IRNLP GroupInformation Retrieval & NaturalLanguage ProcessingEnt rance  PageCreditsThis course is being developed bythe ?UNED Natural Lanouaoe Processinu Grouounder the auspices of the AGO'HUM European e~ork.and p~'tJally funded by E L .~ ~..T.The in-site eof~a,,are used in the course has beendeveloped within the ~ and EuroWordNet projects, TheSpanishteam working In these projects Is formed by researchers?

NLP & IR web-site homepageexamples and interactive xercises.
Informationis now mainly hyper-textual with links to areading list of: references and the glossary.
Aself-test, that.
ican be filled interactively andsubmitted for evaluation to obtain feedback, isalso included for each chapter.
Each exercisehas a didactic description in terms of thefollowing featu:res:?
Estimated workload: Gives anestimation of the time needed to solvethe exercise.?
Difficulty level: three levels areconsidered, easy, medium and difficult.?
Learning Objectives: a description ofthe main purpose of the exercise, eitherin terms of knowledge or skills.?
Character: either Recommended orOptional.?
Media needed: Paper&pencil, Software(provided by our site), or Links toexternal sources.?
Solution: One of these threepossibilities: (i) The solution is directlyavailable (ii) A method to check thesolution is provided (iii) Questions tothink about he results are provided.Figure 2 shows one of the exercises for theInformation Retrieval chapter.Study Guide - offers didactic support to carryout a distance self study of the Contents.
Foreach chapter, the following items are included:(i) A list of the main concepts/principles ortechniques for the chapter.
(ii) Learning Goals, adescription of the concepts/ abilities thestudent/trainee should acquire by the end of herstudy.
(iii) Schedule, an order of study andactivities recommended for distance self-learners.
The study guide provides a guided-tourthrough contents.
It is the path recommended forthe self-learner wishing to carry out the fullcourse.The rest of the buttons provide direct access tothe collection of on-line References, Links toexternal sites, Glossary, Examples, Exercises,Self-tests and Software.
In this way the site canbe exploited also as a complementary esourcefor teachers, trainees, students or professionalsto enrich in a particular way their own learningframework.Estimated workload: 1 h.Difficulty level: Easy.Learning objectives: Get familiarized with IR processes and some of the WWWretrieval engines that will be used in subsequent exercises.Character: Recommended.Media: Link to external source.Solution: Questions to think about your results are provided.Try the following queries on at least four search engines here, and answer the questions.Search for 'Darbuka'.?
How many documents have you found??
Is there a ranking of the documents retrieved?Search for 'Buy a Darbuka'.?
Is there a big difference between the number of documents retrieved inboth searches?
Why??
Is there any difference in the ranking of documents retrieved?Try to use a boolean connective like AND (usually in "Advanced Search"): 'BuyAND Darbuka'?
What has happened??
How many documents have been retrieved??
Is there any relevant document for the query??
Is the use of boolean connectives possible on all the search engines youhave tried??
Is there another way to refine the query'?
How?Now try searching for 'drums' and after for 'drums from the north of Africa'.?
Which of both queries is more general??
Which retrieves more documents??
Can you change the expression "north of Africa" in order to get betterresults??
How does the type of words used affect he retrieval?
For example, Doproper nouns give better esults?
Why??
What happens if we give a description of the term instead of it?Compare the different search engines.?
Which differences have you found in the results??
Do you detect differences in coverage'?
How would you check if a knowndocument is indexed or not for a given retrieval engine??
Which differences have you found in the way of querying?
Is there anyrelation with the results??
Which are the main problems you have found?Figure 2: Exercise 2.0.
Introduction to IR Engines.For instance, the Links button leads to a pagewhere the external inks appearing in our site arelisted under the following headings:?
On-line Search Software?
Search Engines?
Cross-Language T xt Retrieval SearchEngines Demos?
Language Resources, Tools and Services?
On-line dictionaries?
Lexical-Semantic Knowledge Bases?
Morphological analyzers and taggers?
Text Summarization and InformationAccess?
Machine Translation Services?
Sites of interest?
Information Retrieval?
IR and Natural Language Processing?
Cross Language Text RetrievalReferences This is the main source ofdocumentation to follow the course.
There arethree kinds of ~eferences: material from tutorialsor reference books on IR and NLP, relevantpapers on each of the topics covered, andreviews of the state-of-the-art and prospects forthe future.
We ,try to select only freely availableon-line material, to eliminate the significantburden imposed on a distance self-learner if hehas to obtain references in documentationcenters.The Software button leads to a page where avariety of tools related to the course aredescribed.
In some cases they are available forinteractive uge, in others they can bedownloaded and installed in your ownequipment.
Tools are of three kinds: publicdomain, adapted for the course (for example thePorter algorithm) or specially licensed for thecourse.
For the latter we have designed andbuild interactive web interfaces.
Figure 3 showsan exercise inv.olving the use of external (linksin part l, 2 and 6) and internal resources (part3).
Clicking on "this interface", a windowappears where one can write a text and submit itfor "word by Word translation".
The results ofthe morphological analysis and the tagger areshown on the left window, and the dictionarytranslation for lagged words appear on the rightwindow.The Projects button is for registered groups ofstudents, following a regular course (it meansunder the full responsibility and organization ofa tutor).
It provides an environment where youcan perform co!
!aboratively learning activities.4 Current status and FutureActionThe IRL & NLP Course site is currently publicaccessible on the WEB, still on a working status(actually we have invested much more than thefunding).
Now our strategy is to carry out apersonalized call to improve and enrichcollaboratively the site.
We foresee a first phasetargeting selected experts and performing atestbed with our Ph.D. university students.
Thenwe will carry out a dissemination plan throughspecialized networks such as ACO*HUM andprofessional events.We will ask experts for their comments on thecontent and their willingness to establishdifferent degrees of collaboration.
From weakones, such as notifying changes in their URLs,to more involved ones.
For instance,contributing with practical material or tools orbeing included in the directory to answerpotential user questions in order to createincrementally structured FAQs.With students we will test three issues: usabilityfactors, content evaluation as well asexperimental data to contrast the currentworkload estimations of the study guide.Our intention, for dissemination purposes, is toestablish a cooperative framework whereresearchers on the field could updateinformation or contribute with their points ofview.
In this way, this web site would constitutea comprehensive and updated reference for anycourse on the topic.5 AcknowledgementsSpecial thanks to Dr. K. de Smedt for his activerole in launching the ELSNET LE TrainingShowcase initiative, as well as to ELSNET forthe financial support.6 References\[1\] Verdejo, F., and Davies, G.
