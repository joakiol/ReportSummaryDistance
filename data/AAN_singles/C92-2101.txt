LEARNING TRANSLAT ION TEMPLATES FROM B IL INGUAL TEXTHiroyuki KAJI, Yuuko KIDA, and Yasutsugu MORIMOTOSystems Development Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd.1099 Ohzenji, Asao-ku, Kawasaki 215, JapanABSTRACTThis paper proposes a two-phase example-based machinetranslation methodology which develops translationtemplates from examples and then translates usingtemplate matching.
This method improves translationquality and facilitates customization of machinetranslation systems.
This paper focuses on theautomatic learning of translation templates.
Atranslation template is a bilingual pair of sentences inwhich corresponding units (words and phrases) arecoupled and replaced with variables.
Correspondencebetween units is determined by using a bilingualdictionary and by analyzing the syntactic structure of thesentences.
Syntactic ambiguity and ambiguity incorrespondence between units are simultaneouslyresolved.
All of the translation templates generated froma bilingual corpus are grouped by their source languagepart, and then further efined to resolve conflicts amongtemplates whose source language parts are the same butwhose target language parts are different.
By using theproposed method, not only transfer rules but alsoknowledge for lexical selection is effectively extractedfrom a bilingual corpus.One of the key issues in automatic learning is how tocouple corresponding units (words and phrases) betweenbilingual texts.
As far as we know, research done atBSO is the only work which has tackled thisproblem.\[Sadlet90\] To what degree this procedure can beautomated, however, has not been made clear.
We haveindependently developed an algorithm for couplingcorresponding units in bilingual texts.This paper does not deal with the sentence aligningproblem for bilingual texts,\[Brown91\]\[Gale91\] althoughthis is important for automatic learning from translationexamples.
Rather, it discusses an algorithm for learningtranslation templates which assumes that a technique forparallel sentence alignment isavailable.Section 2 will present a rough sketch of our two-phase example-based machine translation system.Sections 3, 4, and 5 will then describe the details of thealgorithm for learning translation templates fromtranslation examples.
And finally Section 6 will discussthe features of the proposed system.2.
Two-Phase Example-based MachineTranslationFigure 1 outlines our two-phase xample-based machine1.
Introductionin the field of machine translation, there is growinginterest in example-based approaches.
The basic idea ofexample-based machine translation is to performtranslation by imitating translation examples of similarsentences.\[Nagao84\] This is similar to a method oftenused by human translators.
If appropriate examples areavailable, high-quality ranslations can be produced.We are developing a two-phase xample-basedmachine translation system which is composed of twosubsystems: learning of translation templates fromexamples and translation based on template matching.This paper discusses in particular how to learntranslation templates from examples.
While mostprevious research in this area has focused on otheraspects,\[Sato90\]\[Sumita91\] we believe that automaticlearning from examples is essential for implementingpractical example-based machine translation systems.

As shown in the figure, a collectionof translation templates are learned from a bilingualcorpus.
Source language (SL) texts are translated intotarget language (TL) texts by using the translationtemplates.Each translation template is a bilingual pair ofpseudo sentences.
And each pseudo sentence is asentence which includes variables.
Conditionsconcerning syntactic ategories, emantic ategories, etc.are attached to each variable.
A word or phrasesatisfying the conditions can be substituted for avariable.
The two pseudo sentences constituting atemplate include the sarne set of variables.
Parallelsubstitution of pairs of words or phrases, which arctranslations of each other, for the variables in a templateproduces a pair of real sentences which are translations ofeach other.The learning procedure is divided into two steps.
Inthe first step, a series of translation templates isgeuerated from each pair of sentences in the corpus.Tiffs first step is subdivided into (a) coupling ofcorresponding units (words and phrases) aud (h)generation of translation templates as shown in Fig.
2.The details of (a) and (b) are described in Section 3 andSection 4, respectively.
In the second step, translationtemplates are refined to resolve conflicts among thetranslation templates.
The details of the second step aredescribed iu Section 5.Translation ba.wal on templates consists of (i) SI.template matching, (ii) translation of words and phrases,and (iii) TL seutence generation, as shown in Fig.
3.Translation temp 'lates arc regarded as directional from SLto TL, although they are actually bidirectional.
First, atranslation template whose SL part matches the SLsentence to be translated is retrieved.
Words and phrasesin the SL sentence are then bound to each variable in thetemplate.
Second, the words and phrases which arebound to variables are translated by a conventionalmachine hanslatiou method.
Aml finally, a TL sentenceis generated by substituting the translated words toniphrases for the wwiables in the TL part of the translationtemplate.3.

means that the phrase has no counterpart.Fig.4 Sentence Analysis Tables and Coupling of PhrasesEnglish sentence, (c) coupling of possible correspondingwords between Japanese and English sentences, and (d)coupling of corresponding phrases between Japanese andEnglish sentences.
(a) Analysis of Japanese sentenceThe Japanese sentence is segmented into words byconsulting a Japanese language dictionary.
Then it isparsed with a parallel parsing algorithm, e.g.
the CYK(Cocke-Younger-Kasami) ethod.
As a result, aJapanese sentence analysis table is produced whichexpresses all possible phrases in the sentence.
ThisJapanese sentence analysis table is a triangular matrix, asshown in the upper right portion of Fig.
4.
Thesyntactic ategories (phrase markers) of all possiblephrases constituted by i-th through (i+j-1)-th words inthe Japanese sentence are written in the (id)-element ofthe table.
Resolution of syntactic ambiguity ispostponed until the phrase coupling step.Acrr.s Dn COLING-92, NAN'I~, 23-28 nOra" 1992 6 7 4 PROC.

23-28, 1992(b) Analysis of English seutenceThe English sentence is similarly analyzed and anEnglish sentence analysis table is obtained.
The Englishsentence analysis table is a triangular matrix, as shownin the lower left portkm of Fig.
4.
(c) Coupling of possible corresponding wordsEach pair of words between the Japanese senteace and itstranslation i  English is coupled if, and only if, the pairis tound in the bilingual dictionary.
Obviously, there ispotential ambiguity in correspondence b tween words ifthe sentence includes words which have a commontranslation.
The most typical case is when a wordoccurs more than once in a sentence, as shown in Fig.
5.In this example, tile correslxmdence b tween the two ').7,' and the two 'path' cannot be determined simply byconsulting the bilingual dictionary.
This anthiguity willtherefore be resolved in the process of coupling phrases.The COUlthng of words between the Japanese andEnglish sentences i done th order to obtain candidatesfor variables in translation templates.
We thereforerestrict coupling to content words.
A content word isusually replaceable with another word without affectingthe grammar of the sentence.
Verbs of course are closelyrelated with sentence pattern, ltowever, agroup of verbscan produce the same sentence pattern.
Therefore verbs,are candidates for variables.
On the other Imnd, functionwords are closely related to sentence patterns.
Moreover,correspondence is not straightforward between Japanesefunction words and English function words.
Therefore,function words shoukl be excluded from coupling.
((1) Coupling of corresponding phrasesThe Japanese and English sentence analysis tables aresearched bottom up for corresponding phrases.
For eachphrase X in the Japanese analysis table, the Englishsentence analysis table is searched for a phrase Y whichincludes a counterpart for each word inside of X, butnone for words outside of X.
If a Y is found, X and Yare coupled together.
(i) Resolution of ambiguity in correspondence betweenwordsAmbiguity in correspondence between words is resolvtxlduring the phrase coupling process as Ii~llows.
Assmnethat a word J in the Japanese seatenee has more than onecounterpart in the English sentence.
When a phrase Xwhich includes J is coupled to a phrase Y in the Englishsentence, it is assumed that the correct counterpart lot' Jis included in Y.
This decision is highly reliable, asshorter phrases are examined before longer phrases.
Anexample of anthiguity resolution in correspondencebetween words is given in Fig.
5.
In this example, theambiguity in correspondence between the two '.'
'~ .X' andthe two 'path' is resolved simultaneously asNP ( .,':.x~?)
) and NP ( path name ) are couplexl togethel: ltere, X( w I w 2 "" Wn) stands for a phrase whose syntacticcategory is X and which is constituted by words w 1' w2'" ' ' ,  and W n,(ii) Resolution of syntactic ambiguityA phrase X in one hmguage sentence S is uot coupled toany phrase in the other langnage ~ntencc T, if T d(~snot include a phrase which includes counterparts fi)r allthe words inside X, but none for words outside of X.This means that syntactic ambiguity is resolvedimplicitly in file process of coupling phrases.
Anexample of this is shown in Fig.
4.
While the Englishsentence analysis table contains NP ( a car with fourdollars ), tim Japanese sentence analysis table does notcontain a phrase which includes ' 4 ', ' \]e it/, and ' tic andnone of the other content words.
Accordingly NP ( a carwith fimr dollars ) is not coupled to any phrase in theJapanese sentence.
This means that NP ( a car with foardollar.,; ) is m jetted.Fig.

While the Japanese sentence analysistable contains NP ( A ?)
B ), the English sentenceanalysis table does not contain a phrase which includesA and B and does not include C. Accordingly NP ( A ?

2.3-28, 1992one phrase containing the same set of content words.
InFig.
7(a).
for example, S'( .,':.7, ~ ~ .elliOT 7~ )andADVP(~J ,  ~ ~ ~- J -~  ~ )contain thesamesetof content words {/'?Y,, ~ , -~ 7o }.
Likewise, S'(the path name is omitted ) and ADVP ( If the path nameis omitted ) contain the same set of content words {path,name, omit}.
There are several possibilities for decidingwhich phrase to couple to which phrase.
We decided thatthe smallest ones should be coupled together and thelargest ones should be coupled together.
In the aboveexample, S ( /~7,  ~ '~- ~ I~T~ )and S'(  the pathname is omitted ) are coupled together, and ADVP (.m 7,:~ ~ l~- J -~  ~ ) and ADVP ( If the path name isomitted ) are coupled together.This strategy is also effective when a content wordhas no counterpart, as shown in Fig.
7(b).
Thebilingual dictionary does not match '0" ( '  with 'play',since 'play' is not the usual translation of 'O" < '.Therefore' O" ( ' has no counterpart in the sentence inFig.
7(b).
According to the strategy, however, phrasesVP(  ~"7.
/  ~ 0"( ) and VP ( play the piano ) arecoupled together.4.
Generation of Translation TemplatesEach pair of coupled units is a candidate for beingreplaced with a variable.
A template is obtained bychoosing a subset of the coupled unit and assigning aunique variable to each pair in the subset.
The syntacticcategories (phrase markers) of the unit in the Japanesesentence are appended to the variable in the Japanese partof the template.
Likewise, the syntactic ategories ofthe unit in the English sentence are appended to thevariable in the English part of the template.The above procedure can be applied to any subset ofthe coupled units, as lung as units which do not overlapare chosen.
Accordingly, a series of translationtemplates can be generated from a pair of sentences.
Apair of sentences and some of the translation templatesgenerated from it are shown in Fig.
2.A translation template need not correspond to a fullsentence.
Fragmentary translation templates, whichcorrespond to fragments in a sentence, improve theflexibility of the system.

Tile fragmentarytemplates can also be used its a component in  aconveutional machine traaslation system.A fragmentary translation template is generated bychoosing a coupled unit pair and applying the above-described procedure to the inside of the units.
Thesyntactic ategories of the units are appended to thefragmentary translation template.
An example of afragmentary translation template is:ADVP( X\[NP\] ~ T ~  ~ )/ ADVP ( if X \[NP\] is omitted ),which is generated from the following pair of sentences.\[ If the path name is omitted, the carrent path isassumed.5.
Refinement of Translation TemplatesObviously the procedure described here also generatessome ineffective templates, which should of course beeliminated from the collection of translation templates.The remaining ones should be refined.In this stage, translation templates are considered tobe directional.
All the translation templates obtainedfrom a bilingual corpus are grouped by their SL part, andfurther subgrouped by their TI, part.
When there is agroup of templates whose SL parts are the same butwhose TL parts are different, we say that they conflictwith each other, because they can produce differenttranslations for the same sentence.If a template does not conflict with any othertemplate, it is judged effective.
It will probably producegood translations for sentences in the domain of thecorpus.
If a template conflicts with many templates, itis judged useless and eliminated from the collection oftemplates.
If a template conflicts with a lower numberof templates, it is judged incomplete but possiblyeffective.
Templates whicll conflict with each other arerefined by examining the original translation examplesfrom which they were generated.
That is, semanticcategories which thstinguish each template are extractedfrom the original translation examples, and attached tovariables in the template.A simple example is given below.
There is aconflict between templates (#1) and (#2):(#1) play XINP\] ~ XINP\] ~ ~ ~.
(#2) play XINP\] " X\[NP\] ~ 0" <.The following are translation examples from which (#1)is generated:play baseball / ~' .~ ~ "# 70.play tennis / 7" :-- ~ ~ -~ 70.And the following are translation exantples from which(#2) is generated:play the piano / I~ T .\] ~_ ~ < .play file v io l in / / ' :4  ? ')
>'~ U" <.The conflict between (#1) and (#2) is resolved by usingthe semantic ategories ' porf ,and 'instrument' extractedfrom these examples.
The following are the refinedversion of the template.s:(#1') play X\[NP/sport\]-- X\[NP\] ~7o .
(t12') play X\[NP/instrument\] ~ XINP\] ~ U" <.6.
Discussion6.1 Advantages of twn-phase example-basedmachine translation"file proposed system has the lollowing advantages.
(1) QualityBasically, a conventional machine translation systemperforms word-for-word translation.
That is, a TLsentence is created from words, each of which is a TLequivalent of a word in an SL sentence.
An example-based machine translation system is, in contrast, capableof creating amore flexible translatiou whereby elementswhich do not have a word-for-word correspondence aretransferre~l as an undivided whole.
We can thereforeexpect improvement in traoslatioa quality.
(2) CustomizabilityWith conventional machine translation systems based ongrammar ules, users are not allowed to modify thegrammar rules, because they are subtly related to eachother and it is difficult o assess the overall effect of rulemodification.
But with the example-based machinetranslation, users can easily customize the system fortheir own fields, e.g.
computer manuals, by providingtheir own translation examples.
This system isparticularly suitable for a field in which similarsentences are written repeatedly.
(3) TrauspamncyA translation template is regarded as a transfer rule.
It iseasy to understand, compared to a tree-to-treetrausformation rule ill conventional n achine translation.Translation is primarily performed by direct transfer ofword string patterus.
A highly transparent system cantherefore be realized.
(4) ContpumtionGenerally speaking, example-based machine translationrequires large amount of cotaputation.
In the proposedarchitecture~ however, examples are transformedbelorehand into intermediate forms by extracting usefulinformation.
The amount of required computation istherefore reduced compared to a system which usestIanslalion examples directly.
(5) Unified treaUnent of translation knowledgeVarious kinds of knowledge for translation are extractedand represented in a single translation templateframework.
For example, the template in Fig.
2 is akind of transfer ule which bridges a structural gapbetween Japanese and English.

Sadler et at.
have developed toolsfor constructing a bilingual corpus in which equivalentunits are linked to each other.\[Sadlerg0\] Fullautomatization, however, has not yet been realized.There are three distinguishing features of thealgorithm presented in Section 3.
First, the algorithmwas designed on the assumption that syntacticambiguities cannot be resolved completely by thepreceding sentence analysis.
Syntactic ambiguities areresolved instead in the phrase coupling prece~.
Second,ambiguities in correspondence between words is resolvedsimultaneously as phrases are coupled.
Third,correspondence b tween phrases is determined withoutcomparing their internal structures, because structuralcoincidence cannot always be expected between a pair ofJapanese and English sentences, even if a dependencystructure is adopted.
These features result in a reliableand efficient algorithm.6.3 Is the translation template inflexible ?The translation template may not be as flexible as thematching expression proposed by Sato.\[Sato90\]However, the introduction of fragmentary templates hasmade it sufficieafly flexible.An obvious restriction of the template is that theword order is fixed.
This is inconvenient for languages,like Japanese, in which word order is flexible.
However,it is not a serious problem, as the system has a learningcapability.
If a corpus includes entences which differ inword order, the system will learn a set of templateswhich differ in word order.
A more important problemto be pursued is how to deal with omissible lements.
Itis not easy Io decide which phrases can be omitted froman example sentence.
Translation templates whichinclude descriptions of phrase omissibility, however,would certainly be effective.7.
ConclusionWe have developed an algorithm for learning translationtemplates from translation examples.
A translationtemplate is a bilingual pair of sentences in whichcorresponding units are coupled and replaced withvariables.
Correspondence b tween units is reliablyidentified by using a bilingual dictionary and the resultsof syntactic analysis of the sentences.
Syntacticambiguity and ambiguity in correspondence b tweenunits are simultaneously resolved.
All translationtemplates generated from a bilingual corpus are groupedby their source language part, and they are then furtherrefined to resolve conflicts among templates whosesource language parts are the same but whose targetlanguage parts are different.This algorithm makes it possible to effectivelyextract a variety of knowledge from a bilingual corpus.Not only is the quality of translations improved, butmachine translation systems can be easily customized.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Mr. Shingi Domen and Dr.Fumihiko Mori for their coustant support andencouragemenLReferences\[Brown91\] Brown, P.F., et al: "Aligning Sentences inParallel Corpora", Prec.
