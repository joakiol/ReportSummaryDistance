LEXICAL FUNCTIONS AND MACHINE TRANSLATIONDirk Heylen, Kerry G. Maxwell and Marc VerhagenOTS, Trans 10, 3512 JK Utrecht, NetherlandsCLMT Group, Essex University, Colchester, Essex CO4 3SQ, Englandemail: heylen@let.ruu.nl, kerry@essex.ac.uk, verhm@essex.ac.ukThis paper discusses the lexicographical concept oflexical functions (Mel'~uk and Zolkovsky, 1984) andtheir potential exploitation i the development of a ma-chine translation lexicon designed to handle colloca-tions.
We show how lexical functions can be thoughtto reflect cross-linguistic meaning concepts for colloca-tional structures and their translational equivalents, andtherefore suggest themselves a some kind of language-independent semantic primitives from which transla-tion strategies can be developed.
~1 Description of the ProblemCollocations present specific problems in translation,both in human and automatic ontexts.
If we takethe construction heavy smoker in English and attemptto translate it into French and German, we find thata literal translation of heavy yields the wrong result,since the concept expressed by the adjective (somethinglike ' excess: i_ve ' ) is translated by grand (large) inFrench and stark (strong) in German.
We observe thenthat in some sense the adjectives stark, grand and heavyare equivalent in the collocational context, but that thisis of course not typically the case in otber contexts, efgrande boite, starke Schachtel and heavy box, wherethe adjectives could hardly be viewed as equiwdent.
Itseems then that adjectives which are not literal trans-lations of one another may share meaning propertiesspecifically in the collocational context.How then can we specify this special equivalence inthe machine translation dictionary?
The answer seemsto lie in addressing the concept which underlies theunion of adjective and noun in these three cases, i.e.,intensification, and hence establish a single meaningrepresentation tbr the adjectives which can be viewedas an interlingual pivot for translation.Collocations have been studied by computational lin-guists in different contexts.
For instance, there is asubstantial body of papers on the extraction of "fre-quently co-occurring words" from corpora using sta-tistical methods (e.g., (Choueka et al, 1983), (Churchand Hanks, 1989), (Smadja, 1993) to list only a few).These authors focus on techniques for providing mate-rial that can be used in other processing tasks such asx The research rcpmlcd in this paper was undmtaken as the project"Collocations and the Lexicalisation of Semantic Operations" (ET-10/75).

Also, the use of col-locations in different applications has been discussedby various authors ((McRoy, 1992), (Pnstejovsky etal., 1992), (Smadja and McKeown, 1990) etc.).
How-ever, collocations are not only considered usefnl, butalso a problem both in certain applications (e.g.
gen-eration, (Nirenburg et al, 1988), machine translation,(Heid and Raab, 1989)) and fiom a more theoreti-cal point of view (e.g.
(Abeill6 and Schabes, 1989),(Krenn and Erbach, to appear)).We have been concerned with investigating thelexical .\['unctions (IJTs) of Mel'0,uk (Mel'6uk andZolkovsky, 1984) as a candidate interllngual device fortbe translation of adjectival and verbal collocates.
Ourwork is related to research by (Heid and Raab, /989).In some respects it is an extension of some of theirsuggestions.
Our work differs fi'om theirs in scope andalso in the exploration of wtrious other directions.2 RepresentationThe use we make of lexical functions as interlin-gual representations, does not respect their originalMel'~.ukian i terpretation.
Furthermore, we have trans-ferred them from their context in the Meaning-TextTheory to a different theoretical setting.
We have em-bedded the concept in an HPSG-like grammar theory?In this section we review this operation.
First we con-sider the features of Mel'~:nk's treatment that we havewanted to preserve.
Next we show how they have beenimported into the HPSG fi'amework.2.1 Collocations and LFsIn Mel'~nk's Explanatory Combinatory Dictionary(ECD, see (Mel'~uk et al, 1984)), expressions such asuneJerme intention, une rdsistance acharnde, un argu-ment de poids, un bruit it~fernal and donner une lefon,faire un pas, commetre un crime are described in thelexical combinatorics zone.
These "expressions plusou moins fig6es" will be called 'collocations'.
Theyare considered to consist of two parts - -  the base andthe collocate.
In the examples above, the nouns are thebases and the adjectives and the verbs are the collocates.The idea that all adjective collocates and all the verb2Head Drivt~n Phrase SlltlCItlrc granllllar, see (Pollard and Sag,1987), (Pollard and Sag, to appear).
For another treatment ,:ff collocations in HPSG, see (Krenn and ltrbach, to appear).1240collocates hare an important meaning component ---roughly paraphrasable as intense and do respectively - -and the fact that the adjectives and verbs are not inter-changeable but are restricted with this meaning to theaccompanying nouns, is coded in the dictionary usinglcxical functions (in this case Magn and Oper).Each article in the ECD describes what is called a'lexeme': a word in some specflic reading.
In the lex-ical combinatorics zone, we lind a list of the lexicalfunclions that are relevant o this particular lexeme.Each lexical function is followed by one or more lex-crees (the result or value of the function applied to tilehead word).
The idea is that each combination of theargument with one of the values of the function formsa collocation in our terminology.
The argument corre-sponds to tile base and each value is a collocate.
The|ollowing fcatures of this representation are importantto us.?
l,exical functions are used to represent an impor-tant syutactico-semantic relation between tile baseand the collocate.?
The restricted combinatorial potential of the col-locate lexcme is accounted for by listing it at eachbase with which it can occur.The secund of these characteristics points out thatthe collocational restriction is seen as a purely lexical,idiosyncratic one: all collocations are explicitly listed.One other aspect of collocations which we have todeal with is the relation between the collocate lexemeand its freely occurring counterpart.
Collocate lcxemesoften differ in some respects from their literal variantswhile sharing other properties.
Mel'6uk deals with thisby including in the ECD an entry for the free variant andputting tile collocate-specific information in the entryfor the base (with the result of the lexical functions).The fil l entry of the eolh)cate is the result of takingthe entry for the free variant and overwriting it with theinformation provided at the base.2.2 Collocations in HPSGThe three aspects of Mel'6uk's analysis we wanted toencode in HPSG were the following.Coding the base-collocate r lation in the lexicon.?
Choosing the level at which \[cxical functions willbe situated.?
Relating the collocate information to the free wni-ant entry.We have provided straightforward solutions to theseproblems.
For tire first problem we have taken overthe ECD architecture ather directly, by creating aded-icated 'collocates' field in the entry t)r  bases whichcontains all the relevant collocates.
As far as the sec-ond problem is concerned, the obvious place to putlcxical funclions is in the semantic reprcscntation pro-vided by HPSG.
There are wtrious reasons for this.
Oneis that 13;s arc used in lhe deep syntax level in Mel'6uk'smodel, a level oriented towards meaning.
Another ea-son is that this level seems most appropriate to be usedin transfer/translation and because we want to use lex-ical functions in transfer, this is where they should be.In contrast to the ECD, the meaning of the collocate isrepresented by the lexical function only.The following is an example of the entry for criti-cism with the encoding of strong as a collocate, a Weuse SEM_IND as all abbreviation for the feature pathSEM.CONT.INI).PHON criticismREST {cl'iticislll(\[~)}COLLS { SEM_IND VAIl \ [~ '  }REST {Magn(~l~)}Just as in the ECD the base contains aspecific zone inwhich the collocates are listed.
In our case, the feature'COLLS' has a set of lexical entries as its value.Each collocate subentry bears the value of the lexicalfunction in its semantics field.
In this representation thelexical function is chosen as the real semantic value ofthe collocate.
One should read the feature structure asspecifying that the semantics of strong (as a collocate)is the predicate Magn(\[~).The collocate subentry only provides partial infor-mation.
In fitct, it provides only the intbrmation thatis specific to the occurrence of strong in its combina-tion with criticism.
In this case only the semantics isgiven.
We further assume that the lexicon also con-tains a 'super-entry' which provides all the informationthat is shared by all the diflerent occurrences of strong.This entry is where the variable Sstrong points to.
Ofcourse, other architectures that try to avoid redundantspecification of information are equally possible.
Forinstance if one assumes a mechanism of default uni-fication, one can have Sstrong refer to the full entrydescribing 'strong' in say its ordinary use, and havethe values that are particular to the collocational strongoverwrite the values provided in the ordinary entry, asin Mel'~uk's proposal.Collocations, Rules and Principles So far, we havenot specified in what way one gets flom the lexical en-tries for the base and the collocate to the representationof the collocational expression.ill HPSG, tile descriptions of complex expressionsarc constrained by principles.
We will assume thatcollocations are snbject o the same constraints.
Theordinary rules of combination (combining adjectivesand nouns, for instance) thus account for lnost of theproperties of the collocational combination.
However,we are still left with the typical 'collocational restric-tion' which nceds to be accounted for.We havc therefore addcd a principle which says thatconstructions that are analysed as collocations (indicated by tile type COLI.OCATION) are either head-adjunctstructure or head-complement structures with specificrcstrietions holding between the head anti the adjunct oraNoticc that hcrc we use a simple VCl'Sion of HPSG basedon (Pollard and Sag, 1987) whereas the actual i nplmncntation wasbased on (Pollard and Sag, to appear).1241the head and the complement respectively.
Let's con-sider the former case 4, illustrated by the heavy smokerexample, The adjunct daughter will contain the adjec-tive collocate.
In such collocational constructions thecollocate adjuncts have to be 'licensed' by the noun orthe head daughter.
This is implemented by requiringthat the collocates field (C'OI,LS) of the head daughtercontains areference to a lexical entry that is compatiblewith the adjunct daughter.
In the literal reading of anexpression such as heavy smoker, the phrase will notbe analysed as a COLL.OCATION and the principle doesnot apply.COLLOCATION -~eI H; jA Ii))7 I,)R'IR ~ CELLS {...~1~\]...} 1...v~OLLOCATE .., > \]COMP_DTRS < ...\[CELLS{... 1\[~..}\]... >3 Issues in TranslationThe project has tried to investigate the use of lexicalfunctions as an interlingual device, i.e., one which isshared by the semantic representations of collocationsin the language pairs ~.The typing of a collocation with such aflmctionopens up the way to a treatment of collocations insidea given language module and hence to a substantial re-duction in the number of collocations explicitly handledin the multilingual transfer dictionary.
The existenceof a collocation function is established during analysis.This infi)rmation is used to generate the correct rans-lation in the target hmguage.
To illustrate, the Englishanalysis modnle might analyse (1) as (2).
The transfermodule maps (2) onto (3) which is then synthesised bythe French module to (4).
(l) heavy smoker-)~ (2) Magn(smoker) -r(3) Magn(fumeur) -4 (4) grand fumeurThe exmnple points out that the translation strategyis a mixture of transfer and interlingua.
The basesarc transferred but the representation f the collocate isshared between the source and the target representation.This treatment of collocations rests, among others, onthe assmnptions that there are only a limited number oflexical functions, that lexical functions can be assignedconsistently, that all (or a signilicant nmnber ot) collo-cations realise a lexical function, that lexical functionsare not restricted to particular languages~ etc.
In thefollowing paragraph we present an outline of the trans-lation process.
Next, we discuss ome of the problemswhich follow flom our approach and we propose someways to solve them.4"lb illustrate tile case of huad-conlplenlent structures ollecoukl ake some support verb construction (also called ligh!
verbconsh'uction).t;For another application ofLFs in a muhilingual NLP contextsee (Held and l/aab, 1989).
For other Imatlnents ofcollocations inlanguage generation see (Nirenburg et al, 1988) and (Smadja ndMcKeown, 1990).12423?1 Lexical Functions as Interlinguait was assumed that the starting point for transfer is thesemantic representation f the phrase.
Using a semanticrepresentation as input to transfer implies that we relatesemantic values of wm'ds and phrases.
For our purposesthis is very satisfying since we will now be using thesemantics of collocates instead of their orthography,in other words: we use lcxical flmctions and abstractaway fl'om the particular realisation of a collocate in aparticular language.We now state the relation between the semantic rep-resentations ofthe source language and target language.The semantic relation between the phrase heavy smokerand its French counterpart can be made explicit in thetbllowing bilingual sign:ENISEM-IND \[ VAR ~ \]RUST { smoker(~l-b,Magn(\[~)}FRISEM_INI) \[ VAR \ [~ 1REST {f.,,,~arI\[-~ M.~/~I)} JTypically, the lexicon will contain a bilingual signfor each possible value of RELN.
Thus, for translat-ing heavy smoker into grandfumeur we will need theobvious entry tot smoker-fumeur plus the entry below:ENISEM-IND \[ VAR \ [~ \]REST {M'lgn(~)}The interlingual status of the lexical function is self-evident.
Any occurrence of Magn will be left intactduring transfer and it will be the generation componentthat ultimately assigns a monolingual lexical entry tothe LF.
63.2 Problemsl,exical Functions abstract away from certain nuancesin meaning and from different syntactic realizations.We discuss some of the problems raised by this ab-stractkm in this section.Overgenerality An important problem stems fiomthe interpretation f LFs implied by their use as an in-terlingua- namcly that the meaning of the collocate insome ways reduces to the meaning implied by the lex-ical./unction.
This interpretation is trouble-free if weassume that LFs always deliver unique values; tmlb,'-tunately cases to the contrary can be readily observed.An example attested fiom our corpus was the range ofadverbial constructions possible with the verbal headoppose: adamantly, bitterl3; consistently, steadjastly,strongly, vehementl); vigorously, deeply, resolutely, etc.The ftmction Magn is an appropriate descriptor in allcases since each adverb functions as a typical intensi-tier in this context.
However each adverb also denotes6p'or more details we refer the reader to (Hcylen, 1993).
Therewe also discuss our implementation in Alep, the C.E.C.

All important question here is howdramatic this loss of translation quality really is.It is essentially ill addressing the issue of ovelgener-ality that Mel'~:uk introduces ub- and superscripts tolexical functions, enhancing their precision and mak-ing them sensitive to meaning aspects of tile lcxicalitems over which they operate.

It' we are to ulaintain aco||sistent interlingual approach to tile hanslation ofthese cases, we illUSt cXlelld our l,F-bascd approachaccordingly.
We consider o|/e case brielly.Cross-lingtlistic analysis reveals many cases wherenonlinal-based collocational ctmstructs are real|sod asconlpot|nds in Gernmnic hulguages, e.g., hunch of keyssleutelbos.

One way to ennflate such aInappi|~g |night be through the use of Mel'~:uk's lex-ical paraphrasing rules.
For instance, one couldconceive ol' a lexical paraphtasiug rule as follows~:W-}- Mul t (W)  e, >//Mul l (W).If we assurne that ill our |uouolingual English lexi-cou, we assign tile collocate bunch as tile Mult  value ofkeyword kt?.,, and that accordingly in tile Dutch iexicalentry Ior sleutel we instant|ate sleutelbos as the vahle oftile nlerged 1,1;//Mult, then we can use the paraphras-lug rule to effect a nlaplfing between tile two 13;'s andhence arrive at an iuterlingual approach to tile traus-lation of tile example, despite structural |nisu\]atches,i.e.,key + bunch\[ Mult(key)\]sleutel bos\[ llMuit( sleutel ) ll;u~lher examples exist where productive nlorpho-logical processes (e.g., affixation 'q) lead to tile lexicalisat|tin in one language of concepts that exist as syntag-nla|ic constructs ill another.

We have suggested some ways in which LFscan be enriched with lexical semantic intbrmation toimprove translation quality.The interlingua level reflects what is semanticallycommon to expressions which form translational equiv-alents.
It abstracts away from specific syntactic re-alisations.
Given that collocations may translate asnon-collocations, we also have to provide a way to rep-resent hese expressions using lexical functions.
Wehave provided an illustration on how to proceed in onesuch case.Acknowledgements We would like to thank the fol-lowing partners and colleagues: Susan Armstrong-Warwick, Laura Bloksma, Nicoletta Calzolari, R.
