Detection of Influenza in itsearliest stage would reduce the spread of the illness.
Sina microblog is a popular microblog-ging service, provides perfect sources for flu detection due to its real-time nature and largenumber of users.
In this paper we investigate the real-time flu detection problem and describea Flu model with emotion factors and sematic information (em-flu model).
Experimental re-sults show the robustness and effectiveness of our method and we are hopeful that it wouldhelp health organizations in identifying flu outbreak and take timely actions to control.1 IntroductionInfluenza is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease caused by influenza virus.
As the highlygenetic variation, influenza can cause global epidemic, which not only brought huge dis-asters to peo-ple?s life and health, but also have significant disruptions to economy.
There are about 10-15% ofpeople who get influenza every year and results in up to 50 million illnesses and 500,000 deaths in theworld each year.
Influenza is a worldwide public health problem and there are no effective measuresto control its epidemic at present.
The prevalence of influenza in China is one of the most notableproblems.The epidemic of SARS, H1N1 and H5N9 influenza make us realized that people really need to ex-pand surveillance efforts to establish a more sensitive and effective precaution indicator system forinfectious disease forecasting.
In order to detect influenza epidemic timely and im-prove the ability ofearly precaution, the research of early forecasting technique is urgently needed.Nowadays influenza surveillance systems have been established via the European Influenza Surveil-lance Scheme (EISS) in Europe and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the US to collect datafrom clinical diagnoses.
The research of forecasting methods started relatively late in China and thesesystems have about two-week delay.
The need for efficient sources of data for forecasting have in-creased due to the Public health authorities?
need to forecast at the earliest time to ensure effectivetreatment.
Another surveillance system is Google?s flu trends service which is web-based click flu re-porting system.
Google?s flu trend uses the linear model to link the influenza-like illness visits.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

When flu breaks out, infect-ed users might post related microblog with corresponding emotions in a timely way which can be re-garded as indicators or sensors of Influenza.
Based on the real-time data of mi-croblog, there has beenmany applications such as earthquake detection (Sakaki T et al., 2010), public health tracking (CollierN, 2012; Paul M J et al., 2011) and also flu detection (Achrekar H et al., 2011; Culotta A,2010).The measures of collecting clinical diagnoses and web-based clicks on key word with linear modelare quite good but not fair enough.
Our research tries to use the big real-time data as re-sources anddesign a machine learning mode with the emotional factors and sematic information to help find thebreak point of influenza.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe our Flu model with emotionfactors (em-flu model).
We describe the preparation of our dataset in Section 3.
Exper-imental resultsare illustrated in Section 4.
We conclude this paper in Section 5.2 Em-flu ModelExisting works on flu prediction suffer the following limitations: Spatial information is seldom con-sidered and sematic or emotion factors are out of consideration.
To address this problem, in this paper,we try to introduce an unsupervised approach called Em-flu Markov Network for early stage flu detec-tion.
Spatial information are modelled in a four-phase Markov switching model, i.e.
non-epidemicphase (NE), rising epidemic phase (RE), stationary epidemic phase (SE) and declining epidemic phase(DE).
Our approach assumes microblog users as "sensors" and collective posts containing flu key-words as early indicators.
Our algorithm can capture flu outbreaks more promptly and accuratelycompared with baselines.
Based on our proposed algorithm, we create a real-time flu surveillance sys-tem.
For early stage flu detection, we use a probabilistic graphical Bayesian approach based on Mar-kov Network.
The key of the flu detection task is to detect the transition time from non-epidemicphase to epidemic phase.Basically, our model is based on a segmentation of the series of differences into an epidemic and anon-epidemic phase using a four-stage Markov switching model.
Suppose we collect flu related mi-croblog data from N location.
For each location i?
[1,N], we segment the data into a time series.
Zi,tdenotes the phase location i takes on at time t. Zi,t=0,1,2,3 correspond to the phase NE, RE SE and DE.Yi,t is the observant variable, which denotes the number of flu related microblog at time t, join in loca-tion i.
?Yi,t =(Yi,t ?
Yi,t-1)/ Yi,t-1.
The underlying idea of Markov switching models is to associate eachYi,t with a random variable Zi,t that determines the conditional distribution of Yi,t given Zi,t.
In our case,each Zi,t.
is an unobserved random variable that indicates which phase the system is in.
Moreover, theunobserved sequence of Zi,t.
follows a four-stage Markov chain with transition probabilities.
For loca-tion i, N(i) denotes the subset containing its neighbors.
We simplify the model by only consideringbordering states in N(i).We model the spatial information in a unified Markov Network, where the phase for location i ateach time is not only dependent upon its previous phase, but its neighbors.
In this work, for simplifica-tion, we only treat bordering States as neighbors.
Since the influence from non-bordering States can betransmitted through bordering ones, such simplification makes sense and experimental results alsodemonstrate this point.
A Generalized Linear Model is used to integrate the spatial information in aunified framework.
For location i at time t, the probability that Zi,t takes on value Z is illustrated asfollows:, 1 , , , 1 , ,, , 1 , 1, , , 1 , , , 1exp( , , , )P Pr( | , , ( )exp( , , , )i t i t i t i t j t i ti t j t i tj t i t i t i t i t i tzZ Z Z Z ZZ Z Z j N iZ Z Z Z Z?

(2)Next, we describe the characteristics for the dynamics of different phases.
Generally speaking, thecourse of influenza may last a week or two, for a single microblog user, we believe his or her mi-croblog contents will record a series of feelings when user is sick or catching flu.
When a person gotthe flu, he will go through NE, RE, SE, DE phases; the main emotion in these four phases would natu-81rally change by the phase change to another phase.
All these individuals?
data could be combined intodatasheet segmented by time.
From the statistics theories, the dynamics for NE, RE, DE and SE can becharacterized as Gaussian process:,2( ) ( )|Pr( ) ~ (E , )day t dai t y tNY z ??

We fetched microblog records containing indicator words shown in Table 1 and col-lect about 4 million flu-related microblog starting from January 2013 to January 2014.
Location details canbe obtained from the profile page.

(snot)Table 1: Indicator seed words set for data collectionNot all microblog containing indicator keywords indicate that the user is infected.
Meanwhile the indi-cator words list may not be perfect, so the indicator words list needs to expand from the data we have andthe dataset needs to be processed before be used for our task.The words in Table 1 will be used as seed words to find the initial dataset and then computing vector inthe dataset to find other keyword which can be the representations of seed words.
In this way, words listcould be expanded and adapt the changes of cyber word.
The necessity of filtering in real-time task hasbeen demonstrated in many existing works (Aramaki E et al., 2011; Sakaki T et al., 2010).To filter out thesebias tweets, we first prepared manually labeled training data, which was comprised of 3000 microblog rec-ords containing key words.
We manually annotate them as positive examples and negative ones.We built a classifier based on support vector machine.
We use SVMlight with a polynomial kernel, andemploy the following simple text-based features.Feature A: Collocation features, representing words of the query word within a window size of three.Feature B: unigrams, denoting the presence or absence of the terms from the dataset.Performances for different combinations of features are illustrated at Table 2.
We observe that A+B ismuch better than A or B.
So in our following experiments, microblog are selected according to a classifierbased on feather A+B.Features Accuracy Precision RecallA 84.21% 82.31% 89.40%B 85.10% 84.92% 87.00%A+B 87.40% 88.75% 89.64%Table 2: Result of different combinations of features for filteringWe briefly demonstrate the relatedness between microblog data and CNIC (Chinese National InfluenzaCenter) surveillance weekly report data, which would support the claim that microblog data can be used forthe flu detection task.
We observe that performing svm filtering and microblog selection would definitelymake microblog data more correlated with real world CNIC data.For these flu-related microblog records, we generate another microblog web crawler to deal withevery record.
For every record?s user, we use this tool to backup user?s microblog content and cut rec-ords by a window of time with one week before and after the flu-related microblog record which wehad captured.
Then the emotional SVM is established to help get the trend of these series of microblogrecords.824 Experiments and Data AnalysisThe main goal of our task is to help raise an alarm at those moments when there is a high probabilitythat the flu breaks out.
In real time situations, for each time, available data only comes from the previousdays, and there is no known information about what will happen in the following days or week.
By addingthe data day by day, we calculate the posterior probability for transiting to epidemic states based on previ-ous observed data.
The sum over parameter Zi,t-1 and Zj,t makes it infeasible to calculate.
We use GibbsSampling by first sampling Zi,t-1 and Zj,t first and then attain the value of Zi,t given Zi,t-1,Zi,t-1,?

The left hand side figurecorresponds to number of flu-related microblog records overtime.
Purple symbols denote the phase of RE,red symbols denote the phase of SE and white symbols denote the phase of DE.Figure 2 shows the result of searching key words like influenza on Baidu Index platform.
Compared toFigure 1 seems our influenza curve matches well.
The interesting thing we observe from figure 1 is that ifthe percentage of RE > 0.5, there is strong possibility to convince the flu alarm is coming.Figure 1: Predictions of the year 2013Figure 2: Searching Resutl on Baidu Index platformFor comparison, we employ the following baseline in this paper:Average: Uses the averager frequency of micrblog records containing keywords based on previousyears as the threshold.Two-Phase: A simple version of our approach but using a simple two-phase in Markove network.We only report partial experimental results for one province.
As we can see from figure 3, ourmodel can best fit the actual microblog data and semms stable.
The other two measures also representthe actual truth but not stable enough.Figre 3: Prediction of Anhui province of the year 2013835 ConclusionsIn this paper, we introduced an unsupervised Bayesian model based on Markov Network based on fourphases and microblog emotional factors are appended in the model to help detect early stage flu detectionon Sina Microblog.
We test our model on real time datasets for multiple applications and experiments re-sults demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.
We are hopeful that our approach would help to facilitatetimely action by those who want to decrease the number of unnecessary illnesses and deaths.
At present, themethod also has a few shortcomings; we will continually develop it for further research and exploration.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThe work is supported by National Natural Sci-ence Funds for Distinguished Young Schol-ar(No.61203315) and 863 National Advanced Tech-nology Research Program of China (NO.2012AA011103), and also supported by the Funding Project for AnHui Province Key Laboratory of Affec-tive Computing and Advanced Intelligent Machine, HeFei University of Technology.ReferenceSakaki T, Okazaki M, Matsuo Y.
