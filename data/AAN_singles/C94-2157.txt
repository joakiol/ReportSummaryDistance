cornAbstractThis paper reports the progress of the Frenchtext-to-speech system being developed at AT&TBell Laboratories as part of a larger project formultil ingual text-to-speech systems, including lan-guages such as Spanish, Italian, German, Rus-sian, and Chinese.
These systems, based on di-phone and triphone concatenation, follow the gen-eral framework of the Bell Laboratories EnglishTTS system \[?\], \[?\].
This paper provides a de-scription of the approach, the current status of theFrench text-to-speech project, and some problemsparticular to French.1 IntroductionIn this paper, the new French text-to-sIieech sys-tem being developed at AT&T is presented; sev-eral steps have been already achieved while othersare still in progress.
First we present a brief' de-scription of the phonetic inventory of French, witha discussion of the approach used to select andsegment phonetic units for the system.
Methodsfor automatic segmentation, and for the choice ofdiphone and triphone units are presented.
Somecomments on durational and prosodic issues fol-low.
We conclude with some discnssions on direc-tions for fllture improw.
'ment, including morpho-logical analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and par-tial phrasal analysis for the purpose of phrasalgrouping.Phonet ic  Descr ipt ion ofFrenchThe French phonetic system consists of 36phonemes, including 17 consonants, 16 vowels,and 3 semi-vowels.
Table 1 shows the differentphonemes; the IPA column contains the phonemesin the standard International Phonetic Alphabi,t;the second column ASCII shows the ascii correspon-dence of these characters for the text-to-speechsystem, and the third column shows art exampleof the phoneme in a French word.Consonant  s VowelsI PA  ASCI I  WORD IPA  ASCI I  WORDp p paixt t toutk k easb b basiI d dosg g gaim m maisn n l iOn.p N gagnerl 1 livref f fauxs s sif S chanterv v vivez z zero3 Z juper r rarei i vivee e thee g a isca a tableu a time3 > hommeo o tgtu U bouey y tourn e l lXce @ seulo & peserI bain~t A bane5 O bonde I bruno A samediSemi -vowelsI PA  ASCI I  WORDj j yeuxw w ouiq W huitTable 1: French Phonetic PhonemesFor the French text-to-speech synthesis ystemwe use 35 phonemes, consisting of 17 consonants,15 vowels (and not 1{3 like in the n,a cohlmn), and3 semi-vowels.
As shown in Table 1, the fourthnasal /de/ has been removed, /07,/ and /g /  beingrepresented by the single phoneme /g/ .
The rea-sons for this change are that (1) /de/ tends to beassimilated to the phoneme/g / ,  and (2) this nasalvowel occurs in very few words in French.

Semi vowels were treated in the same fash-ion as consonants.
Diphones were recorded fol-lowing two (lif\[erent strategies: the first one con-sisted of picking existing words from a dictionarylist.
The second consisted of deciding on a neu-tral phonetic ontext in using logatornes or non-existing words.
Logatomes are phonotactiicallywell-formed strings, which do not exist as wordsin the current French language.2.1.2 Selection of exist ing words frommachine-readable d ic t ionaryA word list was extracted from a subset of theRobert French dictionary \[?\] and the pronuncia-tion fields were extracted.
The dictionary containsalmost 89,000 entries, of which 85,796 entries con-Lain a headword, a phonemic transcription, and apart of speech.
The remaining entries are prefixesand suffixes.
The first task consisted of convert-ing and mapping the dictionary phonemic symbolsto the ones adopted in our system (shown in ta-ble 1).
This was not straightforward since therewas not always a one-to-one mapping between thetwo sets.
For handling symbol mapping, a pro-gram was written that converts any set of charac-ters to any other set of characters I.
The programis developed so that characters coded in octal ordecimal code not only can he translated in eithercode, but also can be input in ascii format for be-ing converted 2Quite often, there was more than one pronunci-ation in the phonetic field and the.
pattern match-ing program chose the pronunciation correspond-ing to the one required.
Moreover, dictionary pro-11 am very grateflfl to Mike Tanenblatt who wrote thisprogram and made a succession ofchanges until completeflexibility of character conversion was obtained.2 This tool allowed the conversion ofdatabases originallywritten on Macintosh, PC, or Unix.
Additionally, we usedit to convert all the French textual databases into latin1 8bit encoding format.nouneiation fields are often not phonetically line-grained enough for acceptable speech output (see\[?\] for a discussion on machine-readable dictionar-ies in text-to-speech systems).
Finally, due to thelack of explicit inflectional information for nounsand adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of theentries were extracted uring dictionary lookup.Sirnilarly for verbs, only the infinil;iwd forms wereused since the dictionary does not list the intleetedforms as headwords.
A program was written tosearch through the dictionary pronunciation fieldand select the longest word where the phonenmpairs would be in mid-syllable position in order toavoid the extraction of' phonemes occuring at thebeginning or end of words.
In this way, l, he influ-ence of lexicM stress was reduced.
The orthog-raphy/prommciation pair \[headword_orth, head-wordq~)hon\] was extracted and headword_orth wasplaced in a carrier sentence for recording.
Outof 1225 original phonemic pairs, 874 words wet'{'.found with at least one occurence of the pair.
Because 1225 is the number of all phonemic pairs inFrench whether they are allowed or not, it is inter-esting to notice that only 874 pairs occur withinreal words in the Robert dictionary.2.1.3 Se lect ion  of logatomesFor the logato.tes, two phonen,es /a /  attd / t /  wereused to encompass the selected iphone, since theyappear to be fairly stable from a phonetic-acousLicstandpoint.
In order to balance the alternation ofvowel and consonant, he words were constructedas follows:Logatome posit ioninitial vow.initial cons.final vow.final cons.COILS.

Nonetheless, theseR)rms were generated and used since they werenecessary for interword phenomena.
Approxi-mately 1225 words were constructed following theab ow~' model.978l{.esearchers disagree as to whether to uselogatomes or real words for synthesis.
The ar-gmnent for using logatomcs is that it is t)etterto collect non-real words so that the diphone ixrecorded as neutrally as possible and does uot un-dergo any real word stress.
Those against arguethai; the (\[iphone is ov(~r-articulated in a logatomeenvironment and that it reduces l,he naturahmss ofthe synthesized sl)eech.
The choice is more cornplex in the sense that it greatly depends on thespeaker, the articulation, and the comfort in reading the two diff('.rent sets.
Given the controversy,in the present system, we decided to record thel)houemie t)airs in bot;h environments, o thai we(:ould choose the best ones,2 .2  The  o ther  po lyphon ic  un i t sI)ue to the variability of liquids and semi-vowels,synthesis based only on (liphones will uot givegood results.
Indeed, such systems have provcuto be insut\[icient.
Researchers \[?\] argue l;ha| di-\])holle COllcat(?ll~ttion alolle is llOt a(l(2(ltlate or sl/f-ticient, particularly for complex transitions.
\[?\]claims that "Meal diphones with perfect (;oncatc-nation would giw~ imperf(~ct results".
Complexpolypho,~es are not equivalent to concatenated all-phones.
Therefore, louger concatcnativ(~ units arenecessary.
Polyphones are defined by \['/\] as be-ing a segmental unit where the initial and linalphoneme are not subject to variability, thus, ex-cluding liquids and semi-vowels.The strategy chosen in the Fre.nch system re-lies on some phonetic ge.neralities to build a set oftril)honcs.
It was decided a to form a (:lass of tri-phoues, based on the following transition: I'VC'~ ,where 1 ) is a phoneme, V a vowel, and Cc a consonaut rel)resenl,ative of the ~trticulatory locations,i.e.
one velar, one dental, and one nasal.
Theset consisted then of 35 phones x 14 vowels x 3consonants = t47() triphon(:s. The same method-ology used for building the set of (liptlones wasused for the triphon(~'s.
These were inchMe(I in acarrier word for the logatomes and extracted fromthe dictionary for the real words.Researchers disagree on which criteria are bestfor the selection of triphones; should the selectiourely on phonectic-a<:oustic <widence, or on statisti-cal evidence, related to tl,e fi'equency of occurrenceof triphones in the language?
Then, once the (:rite-ria is defined, which triphones houhl be selected?Can candidates of a class (say the phoneme /p /3 personal communication with Joe Oliverepresenting all the stops, the phoneme./v/  repre-seutmg all the fficatiw~s) be picked to rel)resent aclass or sit(mid all the phonemes belonging to theclass he sekwted?
Resenreh is underway in thisa,~a using a phone, , ,  clustering approach \[':\], \[':\]that allows the sehx:tion of segnwaltal units fi'om adatabase of I)honemes containing several instancesof the same phoneme.
Tim extraction is made ata spectral point common to the pho,wmes.
Fi-nally, he.cause the nnml)er of selected units atfectsresults, the choi('e of polyphones must be Ilia(h!with care.
'l'aking illto accotlrlt the size limitalion, one has to balanc(~ out the choice of the polyphones considering its frequency in ~he.
language.This brings in the additional complexity of cort)usselection (its language properties, dialects, sociolinguisl,ic tyl)e of language, topic, and size).\[?\] applies a series of rules on phoneum coln-bination to exclude inter-word concatenation thatwould not occur in French.
For example, one can-not lind a glide, in I'~rench that ix not in the leftor right cont;ext of a vowel; therefore, the combi-nation consonant-glide-consonant is excluded.
Anoptimal set of polyphone combinations is com-puted that re.aches a tmmber of 7725 units.
Calcu-lated from texts, statistics are then run on theseilllits to (teterlllille the most freqllellt oc(;iH'elH;esin French, and the numbex of units is lowered to3000, It remains to be seen whether this al)proacllis successfidl iu a workiug system.2.3  Construct ion of  the  corpusA carrier sentence "C'est CAI~I~ItgI~_WOnl) qlle JCdis" was selected to fulfill the following requirei'qeill.s:?
short sentelice~ to record,?
ability t() surrourid the' carrier word to avoidselfl, ential accent and effects,?
phonetically neutral environment.2 .4  Cho ice  o f  a Speakerl?ive male natiw: speakers of Continental Frenchwere interviewed for selc'cting tile voice of thelq'eneh synthesizer.
A sample of text represent-ing highly o('(;uring graphemic trigrams wax pre-pare.d to be used in this task.
The corpus waxrun through a greedy algorithm 4 that returnedthe most frequent words within their sentences4'|'hanks to .Inn Van Santen for developing and runninghis greedy algorithm.979along with a measure corresponding to the cov-erage of the graphemic triphone.
Once tile samplewas recorded by tire 5 speakers, the natural voiceswere run through LPC analysis and re-synthesize.din order to judge the resistance of tile voice tosynthesis.
Five subjects were asked to give theirjudgcrnent on the following criteria:clear articulation: tile voice was carefullylistened to evaluate tire articulation of thespeaker.
Subjective perceptual judgementswere lnade.2.
neutral French accent: the candidate wasasked about tile areas of Franc(: where hegrew up.
The central area of France "l'Ile deFrance" is known for its neutral accent and isregarded as being a well-received accent.
Ad-ditionally, for French native speakers resid-ing in the USA, particular attention was paidto the influence of English in tire prommcia-lion of French, especially for English borrow-ings, such as for example, the company nameAT&T to be pronounced/a  te re / ( the  Frenchway) and not; /el t n t/ as in English.regularity: special attention was given to en-sure that the speaker would have a reason-able degree of regularity in uttering Frenchphonemes.ph:asantness of the voic(.
': the subjects doingthe evaluation were asked to give their opinionon the pleasantness of the voice, in particularthe timber, the level of nasality, and the into-nation.
Of course, this is a highly subjectivematter but a critical one for success.2.5 Recording ConditionsThe recording was done on four non-consecutivedays under the following conditions.
Thc sentences were recorded directly onto the com-puter through a 1)AT (Digital audio 'rape) taperecorder, using interactive software allowing easyreading and repetition of the sentences Lo berecorded.
Additional t ime was devoted to therecording of triphones as well as the re-recording ofsentences that were improperly uttered.
The samecarrier sentence and a regular prosodic contextwas carefully maintained so that  there was mini-real suprasegmental variation.
Once the recordingwas done, the 48 kHz digitized acoustic signal wasdownsized to 12 kllz.2.6 Transcr ip t ion  of  record ing  lna-ter ialFor the recording, all sentences were transcribedfrom the phonetic alphabet to an orthographicIbrrnat.
This was done to allow tile speakerto utter sent(;nees with more naturalness.
Oncethe  record ing  was dorlc'~ th(" sentences  were setni-automatically re-transcribed into phonc%c form.For some~ utterances, the phon('tic transcriptionwas manually adjusted to the idiosynerasi(;s of thespeaker.
For example, it often happened thatconfusion arises between open and closed vow-els, such in the ~ord '~zoologique" zoological thatcan be pronomtced e i ther /zoo loa ik /or /zaa los ik / .In case the output was /zooloaik/ instead of theexpe(%ed /zaalosik/, the transcription was read-justed.2.7 SegmentationSegmentation is presently in progress; efforts arebeing pursued to adapt an automatic segmentorfor English to French and other languages.
In themeantime, rnannal segmentation is being done asa pilot experiment in order to cheek the accuracyof automatic segmentation.
Beyond the scope ofthis paper are many complex issues raised in seg-menting French, such as the segmentation of semi-voweds ( / j / ,  /w/ ,  and /q / )  and liquids ( / l /  and/ r / ) ,  each of these phonemes being quite unstablef?om a phonetic-~eoustic standpoint.
These issueswill be addressed in hmm; work.2.8 Integration of an orthographictranscriberA grapheme-to-phoneme transcriber \[?\] was ac-quired to convert French orthography to a phone.-mie representation.
The software performs somesyntactic and partial semantic analysis of the sen-tence in order to disambiguate the input string.Once performed, spellings at0.
converted in a se-ries of steps into a phonernic representation.3 I ssues  in  Text  AnalysisWe have t)nrsued work in the text analysis ofFrench in order to obtain linguistic data for in-tonation and prosody; additionally, the output ofthe work will be used in the translation project.This aspect of the work has entailed several points:?

Speech synthesisfor French brings a variety of chalh!nges, some ofwhich are specific to French, such as nasal izat ion,liaison, schwa realization, etc.
and some of whichare more general issues, such as vowel hmgthen=ing, prosodic cont, ouring, and intonat ion.
