ThreatTrackers help analysts decompose aninformation gathering topic like the unfolding political situation inIraq into specifications including people, places, organizations andrelationships.
These specifications are then used to collect andbrowse information on a daily basis.
The nearest relatedtechnologies are information retrieval (search engines), documentcategorization, information extraction and named entitydetection.ThreatTrackers are currently being used in the TotalInformation Awareness program.KeywordsSearch, coreference, anaphora, information access.1.
Description of DemoAlias-i ThreatTrackers are an advanced information accessapplication designed around the needs of analysts workingthrough a large daily data feed.
ThreatTrackers help analystsdecompose an information gathering topic like the unfoldingpolitical situation in Iraq into specifications includingpeople, places, organizations and relationships.
Thesespecifications are then used to collect and browseinformation on a daily basis.
The nearest relatedtechnologies are information retrieval (search engines),document categorization, information extraction and namedentity detection.ThreatTrackers are currently being used inthe Total Information Awareness program.ThreatTrackers have two major components, first is amentally natural organization of a data feed we callCognitive Indexing(tm), and second, a user interface whichcombines data triage, browsing and ThreatTrackerauthoring.2.
Cognitive Indexing?Cognitive Indexing organizes text data feeds into mentallynatural units like people, events, things, organizations andrelationships.
For example, the Cognitive Indexingrepresentation for an Entity like Osama bin Laden containspointers to all sentences in the data feed that mention himFig 4, including spelling variation (i.e.
Usama) andpronouns which refer to him.
In future versions of thesystem, the Cognitive Indexing representation of Osama willinclude audio mentions of him as well as database entries forhim.
In addition to coreference, Cognitive Indexing supportsstandard key word lookup, relationship detection betweenentities and analyst authored classes of Entities.3.
ThreatTracker InterfaceThe ThreatTracker interface provides complete analyst control overwhat is in a ThreatTracker, and provides multiple views into thecollected data.
Included are sentence excerpt summaries, tables ofrelationships between Entities and easy access to original sourcedocuments.
There is also a redundant information filter ondocuments or sentences.
ThreatTrackers allow analysts to createnew categories of Entities like ?Chemical Weapons Precursors ?for use inside ThreatTrackers.
Once created, ThreatTrackers serveas a form of information triage against the data feed.4.
