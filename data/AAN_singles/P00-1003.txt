Spoken Language Technology: Where Do We Go From Here?Roger K. Moore20/20 Speech LtdMalvern, UKRecent years have seen dramatic developments in the capabilities and applications of spo-ken language technology.
From a few niche applications for a range of expensive solutions,the eld has developed to the point where keenly-priced products have swept the awards atconsumer electronics shows.
Speech recognisers has reached the high-street store, and a signif-icant proportion of the developed world's population has now been exposed to the possibilityof controlling one's computer, or creating a document, by voice.This apparent progress in spoken language technology has been fuelled by a number of de-velopments: the relentless increase in desktop computing power, the introduction of statisticalmodelling techniques, the availability of vast quantities of recorded speech material, and theinstitution of public system evaluations.However, our understanding of the fundamental patterning in speech has progressed at amuch slower pace, not least in the area of its high-level linguistic properties.
Spoken languageunderstanding continues to be an elusive goal, and the prosodic linkage between acoustic andlinguistic patterning is still something of a mystery.This talk will illuminate these issues, and will conclude with an analysis of the options forfuture spoken language R&D.
