Building an Annotated Japanese-Chinese Parallel Corpus?
A Part of NICT Multilingual CorporaYujie Zhang and  Kiyotaka Uchimoto and Qing Ma and Hitoshi IsaharaNational Institute of Information and Communications Technology3-5 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan, 619-0289(yujie, uchimoto,qma, isahara)@nict.go.jpAbstractWe are constricting a Japanese-Chineseparallel corpus, which is a part of theNICT Multilingual Corpora.
The corpus isgeneral domain, of large scale of about40,000 sentence pairs, long sentences,annotated with detailed information andhigh quality.
To the best of our knowledge,this will be the first annotated Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus in the world.
Wecreated the corpus by selecting Japanesesentences from Mainichi Newspaper andthen manually translating them intoChinese.
We then annotated the corpuswith morphological and syntacticstructures and alignments at word andphrase levels.
This paper describes thespecification in human translation and thescheme of detailed information annotation,and the tools we developed in the corpusconstruction.
The experience we obtainedand points we paid special attentions arealso introduced for share with otherresearches in corpora construction.1 IntroductionA parallel corpus is a collection of articles,paragraphs, or sentences in two different languages.Since a parallel corpus contains translationcorrespondences between the source text and itstranslations at different level of constituents, it is acritical resource for extracting translationknowledge in machine translation (MT).
Althoughrecently some versions of machine translationsoftware have become available in the market,translation quality is still a significant problem.Therefore, a detailed examination into humantranslation is still required.
This will provide a basisfor radically improving machine translation in thenear future.
In addition, in MT system development,the example-based method and the statistics-basedmethod are widely researched and applied.
So,parallel corpora are required by the translationstudies and practical system development.The raw text of a parallel corpus containsimplicit knowledge.
If we annotate someinformation, we can get explicit knowledge fromthe corpus.
The more information that is annotatedon a parallel corpus, the more knowledge we canget from the corpus.
The parallel corpora ofEuropean languages are usually raw texts withoutannotation on syntactic structure since theirsyntactic structures are similar and MT does notrequire such annotation information.
However,when language pairs are different in syntacticstructures, such as the pair of English and Japaneseand the pair of Japanese and Chinese,transformation between syntactic structures isdifficult.
A parallel corpus annotated with syntacticstructures would thus be helpful to MT.
BesidesMT, an annotated parallel corpus can be applied tocross-lingual information retrieval, languageteaching, machine-aided translation, bilinguallexicography, and word-sense disambiguation.Parallel corpora between European languagesare well developed and are available through theLinguistic Data Consortium (LDC).
However,parallel corpora between European languages andAsian languages are less developed, and parallelcorpora between two Asian languages are even lessdeveloped.The National Institute of Information andCommunications Technology therefore started aproject to build multilingual parallel corpora in2002 (Uchimoto et al, 2004).
The project focuseson Asian language pairs and annotation of detailedinformation, including syntactic structure andalignment at word and phrase levels.
We call thecorpus the NICT Multilingual Corpora.
The corpuswill be open to the public in the near future.2 Overview of the NICT MultilingualCorporaAt present, a Japanese-English parallel corpus and aJapanese-Chinese parallel corpus are underconstruction following systematic specifications.The parallel texts in each corpus consist of theoriginal text in the source language and itstranslations in the target language.
The original datais from newspaper articles or journals, such as85Mainichi Newspaper in Japanese.
The originalarticles were translated by skilled translators.
Inhuman translation, the articles of one domain wereall assigned to the same translators to maintainconsistent terminology in the target language.Different translators then revised the translatedarticles.
Each article was translated one sentence toone sentence, so the obtained parallel corpora arealready sentence aligned.The details of the current version of the NICTMultilingual Corpora are listed in Table 1.Corpora Total Original TranslationJapanese(19,669sentences,MainichiNewspaper)EnglishTranslationJapanese-EnglishParallelCorpus37,987sentencepairs;(English900,000words) English(18,318Sentences,Wall StreetJournal)JapaneseTranslationJapanese-ChineseParallelCorpus38,383sentencepairs;(Chinese1,410,892Characters,926,838words)Japanese(38,383sentences,MainichiNewspaper)ChineseTranslationTable 1 Details of current version of NICT MultilingualCorporaThe following is an example of English andChinese translations of a Japanese sentence fromMainichi Newspaper.[Ex.

?E: They were all about nineteen years old and hadno strength left even to answer questions.C: ?????????????????????????????????
?In addition to the human translation, another bigtask is annotating the information.
We finish thetask by two steps: automatic annotation and humanrevision.
In automatic annotation, we appliedexisting analysis techniques and tag sets.
In humanrevision, we developed assisting tools that havepowerful functions to help annotators in revision.The annotation task for each language includedmorphological and syntactic structure annotation.The annotation task for each language pair includedalignments at word and phrase level.The NICT Multilingual Corpora constructed inthis way have the following characteristics.
(1) Since the original data is from newspaper andjournals, the domain of each corpus is therefore rich.
(2) Each corpus consists of original sentences andtheir translations, so they are already sentencealigned.
In translation of each sentence, the contextof the article is also considered.
Thus, the context ofeach original article is also well maintained in itstranslation, which can be exploited in the future.
(3) The corpora are annotated at high quality withmorphological and syntactic structures andword/phrase alignment.In the following section, we will describe thedetails in the construction of the Japanese-Chineseparallel corpus.3 Human Translation from Japanese toChineseAbout 40,000 Japanese sentences from issues ofMainichi Newspaper were translated by skilledtranslators.
The translation guidelines were asfollows.
(1) One Japanese sentence is translated into oneChinese sentence.
(2) Among several translation candidates, the onethat is close to the original sentence in syntacticstructure is preferred.
The aim is to avoidtranslating a sentence too freely, i.e.,paraphrasing.
(3) To obtain intelligible Chinese translations,information of the proceeding sentences in thesame article should be added.
Especially, asubject should be supplemented because asubject is usually required in Chinese, while inJapanese subjects are often omitted .
(4)  To obtain natural Chinese translations,supplement, deletion, replacement, andparaphrase  should be made when necessary.When a translation is very long, word order canbe changed or commons can be inserted.
Theseare the restrictions on (2), i.e., the naturalnessof the Chinese translations is the priority.One problem in translation is how to translateproper nouns in the newspaper articles.
We payspecial attentions to them in the following way.
(1) Proper nounsWhen proper nouns did not exist in Japanese-Chinese dictionaries, new translations were createdand then confirmed using the Chinese web.
Forkanji in proper nouns, if there was a Chinesecharacter having the same orthography as the kanji,the Chinese character was used in the Chinesetranslation; if there was a traditional Chinesecharacter having the same orthography as the kanji,the simplified character of the traditional Chinesecharacter was used in the translation; otherwise, aChinese character whose orthography is similar tothat of the kanji was used in the translation.
(2) Special things in Japan86Explanations were added if necessary.
For example,????
?, translated from ?????
(grand sumotournament), is well known in China, while ???
?,translated from ????
(spring labor offensive), isnot known in China.
In this case, an explanation????????
was added behind the unfamiliarterm.
We attempt to introduce new words aboutJapanese culture into Chinese through theconstruction of the corpus.Producing high-quality Chinese translations iscrucial to this parallel corpus.
We controlled thequality by the following treatments.
(1) The first revision of a translated article wasconducted by a different translator after the firsttranslation.
The reviewers checked whether themeanings of the Chinese translations correspondedaccurately to the meanings of the original sentencesand modified the Chinese translations if necessary.
(2) The second revision was conducted by Chinesenatives without referring to the original sentences.The reviewers checked whether the Chinesetranslations were natural and passed the unnaturaltranslations back to translators for modification.
(3) The third revision was conducted by a Chinesenative in the annotation process of Chinesemorphological information.
The words that did notexist in the dictionary of contemporary Chinesewere checked to determine whether they were newwords.
If not, the words were designated asinformal or not written language and were replacedwith suitable words.
The word sequences thatmissed the Chinese language model?s part-of-speech chain were also adjusted.Until now, 38,383 Japanese sentences havebeen translated to Chinese, and of those, 22,000Chinese translations have been revised three times,and we are still working on the remaining 18,000Chinese translations.4 Morphological Information AnnotationAnnotation consists of automatic analyses andmanual revision.4.1 Annotation on Japanese SentencesJapanese morphological and syntactic analysesfollow the definitions of part-of-speech categoriesand syntactic labels of the Corpus of SpontaneousJapanese (Maekawa, 2000).A morphological analyzer developed in thatproject was applied for automatic annotation on theJapanese sentences and then the automaticallytagged sentences were revised manually.
Anannotated senetence is illustrated in Figure 1, whichis the Japanese sentence in Ex.

An annotated Japanese sentenceThe data of one sentence begins from the line ?# S-ID... ?
and ends with the mark ?EOJ?.
The lineheaded by ?*?
indicates the beginning of a phraseand the following lines are morphemes in thatphrase.
For example, the line ?
* 0 2D?
indicates thephrase whose number is 0.
The following line ?????

The achievements include agrammatical knowledge base of contemporaryChinese, an automatic morphological analyser, andan annotated People?s Daily Corpus.
Since thedefinition and tagset are widely used in Chineselanguage processing, we also took the criteria as thebasis of our guidelines.A morphological analyzer developed by PekingUniversity (Zhou and Yu, 1994) was applied forautomatic annotation of the Chinese sentences andthen the automatically tagged sentences wererevised by humans.

The inputof the tool is the automatically segmented and part-of-speech tagged sentences and the output is reviseddata.
The basic functions include separating asequence of characters into two words, combiningtwo segmented words into one word, and selectinga part-of-speech for a segmented word from a list ofparts-of-speech.
In addition, the tool has thefollowing functions.
(1) Retrieves a word in the grammatical knowledgebase of contemporary Chinese of Peking University(Yu et al, 1997).This is convenient when annotators want toconfirm whether a segmented word is authorized bythe grammatical knowledge base, and when theywant to know the parts-of-speech of a word definedby the grammatical knowledge base.
(2) Retrieves a word in other annotated corpora orthe sentences that have been revised.This is convenient when annotators want to seehow the same word has been annotated before.
(3) Retrieves a word in the current file.It collects all the sentences in the current filethat contain the same word and then sorts theircontext on the left and right of the word.
Byreferring to the sorted contexts, annotators canselect words with the same syntactic roles andchange all of the parts-of-speech to a certain one allin one operation.
This is convenient whenannotators want to process the same word indifferent sentences, aiming for consistency inannotation.
(4) Adds new words to the grammatical knowledgebase dynamically.The updated grammatical knowledge base canbe used by the morphological analyser in the nextanalysis.
(5) Indexes to sentences by an index file.The automatically discovered erroneousannotations can be stored in one index file, pointingto the sentences that are to be revised.The interface of the tool is shown in Figure 4and Figure 5.Figure 4 Interface of the manual revision tool (Retrievesa word in the grammatical knowledge base ofcontemporary Chinese)Figure 5    Interface of the manual revision tool(Retrieves a word in the current file)In Figure 4, the small window in the lower leftdisplays the retrieved result of the word ?
???
inthe grammatical knowledge base; the lower rightwindow displays the retrieved result of the sameword in the annotated People?s Daily Corpus.88In Figure 5, the small window in the lower left is used todefine retrieval conditions in the current file.
In thisexample, the orthography of ????
is defined.
Thelower right window displays the sentences containing theword  ????
retrieved from the current file.
The left andright contexts of one word are shown with the retrievedword.
The contents of any column can be sorted byclicking the top line of the column.5 Annotation of word alignmentSince automatic word alignment techniques cannotreach as high a level as the morphological analyses,we adopt a practical method of using multiplealigners.
One aligner is a lexical knowledge-basedapproach, which was implemented by us based onthe work of Ker (Ker and Chang, 1997).
Anotheraligner is the well-known GIZA++ toolkit, which isa statistics-based approach.
For GIZA++, twodirections were adopted: the Chinese sentenceswere used as source sentences and the Japanesesentences as target sentences, and vice versa.The results produced by the lexical knowledge-based aligner, C?
J of GIZA++, and J?C ofGIZA++ were selected in a majority decision.
If analignment result was produced by two or threealigners at the same time, the result was accepted.Otherwise, was abandoned.
In this way, we aimedto utilize the results of each aligner and maintainhigh precision at the same time.
Table 2 showed theevaluation results of the multi-aligner on 1,127 testsentence pairs, which were manually annotated withgold standards, totally 17,332 alignments.Precision(%)Recall(%)F-measureMulti-aligner 79.3 62.7 70Table 2 Evaluation results of the multi-alignerThe multi-aligner produced satisfactory results.This performance is evidence that the multi-aligneris feasible for use in assisting word alignmentannotation.For manual revision, we also developed anassisting tool, which consist of a graphical interfaceand internal data management.
Annotators cancorrect the output of the automatic aligner and addalignments that it has not identified.
In addition toassisting with word alignment, the tool alsosupports annotation on phrase alignment.
SinceJapanese sentences have been annotated with phrasestructures, annotators can select each phrase on theJapanese side and then align them with words onthe Chinese side.
For idioms in Japanese sentences,two or more phrases can be selected.The input and output file of the manualannotation is in XML format.
The data of onesentence pair consists of the Chinese sentenceannotated with morphological information, theJapanese sentence annotated with morphologicaland syntactic structure information, word alignment,and phrase alignment.The alignment annotation at word and phrase isongoing, the former focusing on lexical translationsand the latter focusing on pattern translations.
Aftera certain amount of data is annotated, we plan toexploit the annotated data to improve theperformance of automatic word alignment.
We willalso investigate a method to automatically identifyphrase alignments from the annotated wordalignment and a method to automatically discoverthe syntactic structures on the Chinese side from theannotated phrase alignments.6 ConclusionWe have described the construction of a Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus, a part of the NICTMultilingual Corpus.
The corpus consists of about40,000 pairs of Japanese sentences and theirChinese translations.
The Japanese sentences areannotated with morphological and syntacticstructures and the Chinese sentences are annotatedwith morphological information.
In addition, wordand phrase alignments are annotated.
A high qualityof annotation was obtained through manualrevisions, which were greatly assisted by therevision tools we developed in the project.
To thebest of our knowledge, this will be the firstannotated Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus in theworld.In the future, we will finish the annotation on theremaining data and add syntactic structures to theChinese sentences.ReferencesDice, L.R.
