Artificial Intelligence Laboratory545 Technology Square, Room 810Cambridge, MA 02139, USAinternet: bonnie@reagan.ai.mit.eduABSTRACTThough most translation systems have some mechanismfor translating certain types of divergent predicate-argumentstructures, they do not provide a genera\] procedure that takesadvantage of the relationship between lexical-semantic struc-ture and syntactic structure.
A divergent predicate-argumentstructure is one in which the predicate (e.g., the main verb)or its arguments (e.g., the subject and object) do not havethe same syntactic ordering properties for both the sourceand target language.
To account for such ordering differ-ences, a machine translator must consider language-specificsyntactic idiosyncrasies that distinguish a target language?rom a source language, while making use of lexical-semanticuniformities that tie the two languages together.
This pa-per describes the mechanisms used by the UNITRAN ma-chine translation system for mapping an underlying lexical-conceptual structure to a syntactic structure (and vice ?erea),and it shows how these mechanisms coupled with a set of gen-eral linking routines olve the problem of thematic divergencein machine translation.1 INTRODUCTIONThere are a number of different divergence types thatarise during the translation of a source language to a tar-get language.
Figure 1 shows some of these divergenceswith respect o Spanish, English, and German.
1We will look at each of these traditionally diflicnlt di-vergence types in turn.
The first divergence type is astructural divergence in that the verbal object is real-ized as a noun phrase (John) in English and as a prepo-sitional phrase (a Juan) in Spanish.
The second diver,*This paper describes research done at the Artificial In-telligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology.

Also, a single sentence may exhibitany or all of these divergences.Divergence TranslationType EzampleStructuralConflationalLexicalCategorialThematicI saw JohnV ia  Juan(I saw to John)I like MaryIch habe Marie gem(I have Mary likingly)I stabbed JohnYo le di pufialadas a Juan(I gave knife-wounds to John)I am hungryIeh habe Hunger(I have hunger)I like MaryMaria me gusta a mf(Mary pleases me)Figure 1: Divergence Types in Machine Translationgence is conttational.
Conflation is the incorporation ofnecessary participants (or arguments) of a given action.Here, English uses the single word like for the two Ger-man words haben (have) and gem (likingly); this is be-cause the manner argument (i.e., the likingly portion ofthe lexical token) is incorporated into the main verb inEnglish.
The third divergence type is a lcxical diver-gence as illustrated in the stab example by the choice ofa different lexical word dar (literally give) for the wordstab.
The fourth divergence type is categoria\] in that thepredicate is adjectival (hungry) in English but nominal(hunger) in German.
Finally, the fifth divergence typeis a thematic divergence: the object (Mary) of the En-glish sentence is translated as the subject (Maria) in theSpanish sentence.The final divergence type, thematic divergence, is theone that will be the focus of this paper.
We will look at127how the UNITRAN system \[Doff, 1987, 1990\] solves thethematic divergence problem by mapping an underlyinglexical-conceptual structure to a syntactic structure (andvice versa) on the basis of a set of general linking routinesand their associated mechanisms.
The other divergencesare also handled by the UNITRAN system, but these arediscussed in \[Doff, 1990\].It turns out there ate two types of thematic diver-gences that show up in the translation of a source lan-guage to a target language: the first type consists of areordering of arguments for a given predicate; and thesecond type consists of a reordering of predicates withrespect o their arguments or modifiers.
We will look atexamples of each of these types in turn.In the first case, an example is the reversal of the sub-ject with an object as in the English-Spanish example ofgustar-like shown in figure 1.
The predicate-argumentstructures axe shown here: 2\[,-MAx IN-MAX Maria\]\[V-MAX \[V-1 \[V-MIN me gusts\] \[P-MAX a rmq\]\]\](1)\[I-MAX IN-MAX 1\]\[V-MAX \[`'I \[` " M~N me\] \[N~AX Mary\]\]\]\]Here the subject Marls has reversed places with the ob-ject mr.
The result is that the object mi turns into thesubject I, and the subject Marls turns into the objectMary.
The reverse would be true if translation went inthe opposite direction.An example of the second case of thematic divergence(not shown in figure 1) is the promotion of a comple-ment up to the main verb, and the demotion of the mainverb into an adjunct position (or v/ce versa).
By promo-tion, we mean placement "higher up" in the syntacticstructure, and by demotion, we mean placement "lowerdown" in the syntactic structure.
This situation arisesin the translation of the Spanish sentence Juan suele ir aeasa into the English sentence John usually goes home:(2)\[X-MAX \[~-MAX Juan\]\[`'-MAX \[V-* \[V-Mm suele\]\[,,-MAX ir\] b-MAX a casa\]\]\]\]\]\[z-MAx \[N-u.x John\]Iv.MAX \[V.X \[v-i USually Iv.raN goes\]\]IN.MAX home\]\]\]\]Here the main verb soler takes ir as a complement; but,in English, the ir predicate has been placed into a higherposition as the main verb go, and soler is placed into alower position as the adjunct usually associated with themain verb.
The reverse would be true if translation wentin the opposite direction.MOlten times a native speaker of Spanish will invert thesubject o post-verbal position:\[I-MAX el IV-MAX \[V-1 \[V-Mm me gusta\] \[P-MAX aml\]\]\]IN-MAX Maria\]i\].However, this does not affect the internal/external reversalscheme described here since inversion takes place indepen-dently after thematic divergences have been handled.Another example of the second case of thematic di-vergence is the demotion of the main verb into a com-plement position, and the promotion of an adjunct upto the main verb (or vice versa).
This situation arisesin the translation of the German sentence Ich esse geminto the English sentence I like eating:\[I.MAX IN-MAX Ich\]IV-MAX IV-!
\[V-S \[V-MTN esse\] gem\]\]\]\](3)\[X-M~x C~-MAx ~\[\]\[,'-MAX \[V.~ \ [` ' -~ ~e\] \[V-M~X eating\]\]\]\]Here the main verb essen takes gem as an adjunct;but, in English, gem has been placed into a higher po-sition as the main verb like, and the essen predicatehas been placed into a lower position as the complementeating of the main verb.
The reverse would be true iftranslation went in the opposite direction, aThis paper will show how the system uses three mech-anisms along with a set of general inking routines (tobe defined) to solve thematic divergences such as thosethat have been presented.
The next section introducesthe terminology and mechanisms that are used in thesolution of these divergences, and, in so doing, it willprovide a brief glimpse of how thematic divergences aretackled.
Section 3 discusses other approaches (and theirshortcomings) in light of the thematic divergence prob-lem.
Finally, section 4 presents a general solution for theproblem of thematic divergences, howing in more detailhow a set of general inking routines and their associ-ated mechanisms provide the appropriate mapping fromsource to target language.2 TERMINOLOGY ANDMECHANISMSBefore we examine thematic divergences and how theyare solved, we must first look at the terminology andmechanisms used throughout this paper: 4sit might be argued that a "direct" translation is possiblefor each of these three examples:(It) Mary pleases me(21) John is accustomed to going home(3,) I eat -~"ins\]yThe problem with taking a direct approach is that it is notgeneral enough to handle a wide range of cases.
For example,gem can be used in conjunction with haben to mean like:Ich babe Marie gem ('I like Mary').
The literal translation, Ihave Mary likingly, is not only stylistically unattractive, butit is not a valid translation for this sentence.
In addition, thedirect-mapping approach is not bidirectional in the generalcase.
Thus, even if we did take (1,), (2,), and (3,) to bethe translations for (1), (2), and (3), we would not be ableto apply the same direct mapping on the English sentencesof (1), (2), and (3) (translating in the opposite direction)because we would still need to translate like and usually intoSpanish and German.
It is clear that we need some type ofuniform method for translating thematic divergences.4The terms complement, specifier, and adjunct have notbeen defined; roughly, these correspond to syntactic object,128Def in i t ion 1: An LCS is a lexical conceptualstructure conforming to a modified version of Jack-endoff's well-formedness rules \[Jackendoff, 1983\].For example, I like Mary is represented as:\[State BEIdeat(\[Tsi~s REFERENT\],\[Place ATIdeat(\[~ka, m/:FERENT\], \[Th'-, PERSOI~\])\],\ [ ,  .
.
.
.
.
LIKINGLY\])\]The mapping that solves thematic divergences i de-fined in terms of the RLCS, the CLCS, the syntacticstructure, and the markers that specify internal/externaland promotion/demotion information.
These markers,or mechanisms, are specified as follows:MechAnism 1: The :INT and :EXT markers areoverride position markers that determine wherethe internal and external arguments will be po-sitioned for a given lexical root word.Def in i t ion 2: An RLCS is an uninstantiated LCSthat is associated with a root word definition inthe lexicon (i.e., an LCS with unfilled variable po-sitions).
For example, an RLCS associated withthe word like is:\[Sta*, BEId,~,(\[Thla, X\],\[Place ATIdoa, (\[Thing X\], \[Thing "Y\])\],\[M .
.
.
.
.
LIKINGLY\])\]Definit ion 3: A CLCS is a composed (in-stantiated) LCS that is the result of combin-ing two or more RLCS's by means of unification(roughly).
This is the interlingua or language-independent form that is the pivot between thesource and target language.
For example if wecompose the RLCS for like with the RLCS's for I(\[~hi.s REFERENT\]) and Mary (\[Thing PERSON\]),we get the CLCS corresponding to 2" like Mary (asshown in definition 1).Def in i t ion 4: An Internal Argument Position isa syntactic omplement for a lexical word of cate-gory V, N, A, P, I, or C. sDef in i t ion 5: An Ezternal Argument Position isa syntactic specifier of N for a lexical word of cat-egory N or a specifier of I for a lexical word ofcategory V.Definit ion 6: An Adjunct Argument Position isa syntactic modifier that is neither internal norexternal with respect o a lexieal word.Each word entry in the lexicon is associated with anRLCS, whose variable positions may have certain re-strictions on them such as internai/external nd pro-motion/demotion i formation (to be described).
TheCLCS is the structure that results from combining thelexieal~ items of a source-language s ntence into a singleunderlying pivot form.subject, and modifier, respectively.
For a more detailed e-scription of these and some of the other definitions here, see\[Dorr, 1990\].sv, N, A, P, I, and C stand for Verb, Noun, Adjective,Preposition, Inflection, and Complementiser, respectively.For example, the lexical entry for gustar is anRLCS that looks like the RLCS for like (see defini-tion 2) except hat it includes the :INT and :EXTma~kers:\[State BEldent(\[T~ims X :mT\],\[Place ATId.m, (\[Thi-s X\], \[TSiffig Y :EXT\])\],\[ma.ae, LIKINGLY\])\]During the mapping from the CLCS (shown in def-inition 1) to the syntactic structure, the RLCSfor gustar (or like) is matched against he CLCS,and the arguments are positioned according to thespecification associated with the RLCS.
s Thus,the :INT and :EXT markers account for the syn-tactic distinction between Spanish and English byrealizing the \[Thing REFERENT\] node of the CLCS(corresponding to X in the RLCS) as the inter-nal argument ml in Spanish, but as the externalargument I in English; and also by realizing the\[T~i,s PERSON\] node of the CLCS (correspondingto Y in the RLCS) as the external argument Mariain Spanish, but as the internal argument Mary inEnglish.
Note that the :INT and :EXT mark-ers show up only in the ILLCS.
The CLCS doesnot include any such markers as it is intended tobe a language-independent representation for thesource- and target-language s ntence.Mechan ism 2: The :PROMOTE marker associ-ated with an RLCS 7f places a restriction on thecomplement 7~1 of the head 7~t.
7 This restrictionforces 7~1 to be promoted in the CLCS as the head7 ~.
7~ is then dropped into a modifier position ofthe CLCS, and the logical subject of 7 ~ is inher-ited from the CLCS associated with the syntacticsubject of ?/I.
sFor example, the lexical entry for soler containsa :PROMOTE marker that is associated with theRLCS: \[~ .
.
.
.
.
HABITUALLY :PROMOTE\]Thus, in the above formula 7"/!
corresponds tosoler, and 7~1 corresponds to the complement ofsoler.
The :PROMOTE marker forces the syntac-tic complement 7~!
to be promoted into headSThe lexlced-selection procedure that maps the CLCS tothe appropriate RLCS (for like or gustar) is not described indetail here (see \[Dorr, 1990\]).
Roughly, lexical selection is a129 unification-like process that matches the CLCS to the RLCStemplates in the lexicon, and chooses the associated lexicalwords accordingly.position as 7 ) in the CLCS, and the head 7/I to bedemoted into modifier position as 7/in the CLCS.So, in example (2) of the last section, the resultingCLCS is: 9\[,,?n, GOLo,(\[Thing PERSON\],\[P.,h TOLo~(\[mac.
ATLo.
(\[Thi.g PERSON\], \[p,.?.
HOME\])\])\],\[M .
.
.
.
.
HABITUALLY\])\]Here the RLCS for soler, \[M .
.
.
.
.
HABITUALLY\],corresponds to 7"l and the RLCS for it, \[B,?~t GO ...\],corresponds to :P. In the translation to English,\[~ .
.
.
.
.
HABITUALLY\] is not promoted, so it is re-alized as an adjunct usually of the main verb go.Mechan ism 3: The :DEMOTE marker associ-ated with an RLCS 7 ~ places a restriction on thehead 7~1 of the adjunct :Pt.
This restriction forces7~ to be demoted into an argument position of theCLCS, and the logical subject of ~ to be inheritedfrom the logical subject of 7"l.For example, the lexical entry for gem contains a:DEMOTE marker that is associated with the Yargument in the RLCS:\[stAte BEcl,c(\[Thi., x\],\[mac?
ATm,~ (\[Thins X\], \[~,,=, Y :DEMOTE\])\],\[M .
.
.
.
.
LIKINGLY\])\]Thus, in the above formula, T~t corresponds togem and 7~!
corresponds to the syntactic headthat takes gem as an adjunct.
The :DEMOTEmarker forces the head 7~ I to be demoted into anargument position as 7~ in the CLCS, and the ad-junct 7~1 to be promoted into head position as 7 ~in the CLCS.
So in example (3) of the last section,the resulting CLCS is:\[s,*,, BEci,c(\[Thing REFERENT\],\[PIn?, ATci,?
(\[T~i=g REFERENT\],\[,,?n, EAT  (\[Thi~s REFERENT\], \[Thing FOOD\])\])\],.
.
.
.
.
LIKINGLY\])\] 10Here the RLCS for gem, \[s,a,oBEci~ .
.
.
.
\],corresponds to :P and the RLCS for es-sen, \[s,nt?
EAT ...\], corresponds to 7"l. In thetranslation to English, \[st**e BEc~ .
.
.
.
\] is not de-moted, so it is realized as the main verb like thattakes eating as its complement.PIn general, a syntactic argument ul is the canonical syn-tactic realization (CS~) of the corresponding CLCS argu-ment u.
The CS7~ function is a modified version of a routineproposed in \[Chomsky, 1986\].
See \[Dorr, 1990\] for a moredetailed iscussion of this function.SThe logical subject is the highest/left-most argument inthe CLCS.
130Now that we have looked briefly at the mechanismsinvolved in solving thematic divergences in UNITRAN,we will look at how other approaches have attempted tosolve this problem.3 PREVIOUS APPROACHESIn tackling the more global problem of machine transla-tion, many people have addressed ifferent pieces of thethematic divergence problem, but no single approach asyet attempted to solve the entire space of thematic di-vergence possibilities.
Furthermore, the pieces that havebeen solved are accounted for by mechanisms that arenot general enough to carry over to other pieces of theproblem, nor do they take advantage of cross-linguisticuniformities that can tie seemingly different languagestogether.Gretchen Brown has provided a model of German-English translation that uses lezical semantic structures\[Brown, 1974\].
The work is related to the model devel-oped for UNITRAN since both use a form of conceptualstructure as the basis of translation.
While this approachgoes a long way toward solving a number of translationproblems (especially compound noun disamhiguation), itfalls short of providing a systematic solution to the the-matic divergence problem.
This is largely because theconceptual structure does not serve as a common repre-sentation for the source and target languages.
Instead, itis used as a point of transfer, and as such, it is forced toencode certain language-specific idiosyncrasies uch asthe syntactic positioning of conceptual arguments.
Interms of the representations used in UNITRAN, thisapproach is analogous to using a language-to-languagemapping from the RLCS's of the source language to theRLCS's of the target language without using an interme-diate language-independent structure as a pivot form.
Insit should be noted that promotion and demotion struc-truces are inverses of each other.
Thus, although this CLCSlooks somewhat "English-like," it is possible to represent theCLCS as something that looks somewhat "Spanish-like:"\[State Beclze(\[Thing PERSON\],\[Place ATcirc(\[Thing PI~RSOiN\],\[Event GOLoc(\[Thing PERSON\],\[Path TOLo?
(\[Place ATLoc (\[Thing PERSON\], \[Place HOME\])\])\])\])\],\[M .
.
.
.
.
HABITUALLY\])\]In this case, we would need to use the :DEMOTE marker (seemechanism 3) instead of the :PROMOTE marker, but thismarker would be used in the RLCS associated with usuallyinstead of the RLCS associated with soler.
The justificationfor using the "English-like" version for this example is thatthe \[Manner HABITUALLY\] constituent is generally thought ofas an aspcctual clement associated with a predicate (e.g., inGerman, the sentence would be Ich gehe gewJhnlich nachHause ('I go usually home')); this constituent cannot beused as a predicate in its own right.
Thus, the compli-cated "Spanish-like" predicate-argument structure is not alikely conceptual representation for constructions that use\[Manner HABITUALLY\].1?The default object being eaten is \[Thing FOOD\], althoughthis is not syntactically realized in this example.this approach, there is no single language-independentmechanism that links the conceptual representation tothe syntactic structure; thus, it is necessary to hand-code the rules of thematic divergence for English andGerman, and all divergence generalizations are lost.In 1982, Lytinen and Schank developed the MOP-TRANS Spanish-English system based on conceptual de-pendency networks \[Lytinen & Schank, 1982\].
11 Thisapproach is related to the UNITRAN model of transla-tion in that it uses an interlingual representation as thepivot from source to target language.
The key distinc-tion is that the approach lacks a generalized linking tosyntax.
For example, there is no systematic method fordetermining which conceptual argument is the subjectand which is the object.
This means that there is nouniform mechanism for handling divergences such as thesubject-object reversal of example (1).The LMT system is a logic-based English-German ma-chine translator based on a modular logical grammar\[McCord, 1989\].
McCord specifically addresses the prob-lem of thematic divergence in translating the sentenceMir gef~llt der Waged (I like the car).
However, the so-lution that he offers is to provide a "transfer entry" thatinterchanges the subject and object positions.
There aretwo problems with this approach.
First it relies specifi-cally on this object-initial ordering, even though the sen-tence is arguably more preferable with a subject-initialordering Der Wagen gef~llt mir; thus, the solution isdependent on syntactic ordering considerations, and willnot work in the general case.
Second the approach doesnot attempt o tie this particular type of thematic di-vergence to the rest of the space of thematic divergencepossibilities; thus, it cannot uniformly translate a con-ceptually similar sentence Ich \]ahre das Wagen gem (Ilike to drive the car).4 THEMATIC  D IVERGENCESIn section 1, we introduced some examples of thematicdivergences, and in section 2 we described some of themechanisms that are used to solve these divergences.Now that we have looked at other machine transla-tion approaches with respect o the thematic divergenceproblem, we will look at the solution that is used in theUNITRAN system.Recall that there are two types of thematic diver-gences:1.
Different argument positionings with respectto a given predicate.2.
Different predicate positionings with respectto arguments or modifiers.The first type covers the case of argument positions thatdiverge; it is accounted for by the :INT and :EXT mark-ers.
The second type covers the case of predicate posi-tions that diverge; it is accounted for by the :PROMOTE11Several researchers have worked within this frameworkincluding Goldman \[1974\], Schank & Abelson \[1977\], andmany others.
131and :DEMOTE markers.
Together, these two types ofdivergences account for the entire space of thematic di-vergences, ince all participants must be one of these two(either an argument, or a predicate, or both).In both cases of thematic divergence, it is assumedthat there is a CLCS that is derived from a source-language RLCS that is isomorphic to the correspond-ing target-language RLCS (i.e., the variables in the 2RLCS's map to the same positions, though they maybe labeled differently).
Furthermore, it is assumed thatthematic divergence arises only in eases where there is alogical subject.A CLCS with logical subject w, non-subjectarguments Zl, z2, .

,n ,~\ ]In order to derive the syntactic structure from theCLCS, we need a mapping or linking rule between theCLCS positions and the appropriate syntactic positions.Roughly, this linking rule is stated as follows:Genera l  L inking Rout ine  G:(a) Map the logical subject o the external argu-ment position.
(b) Map the non-logical-subjects to internal ar-gument positions.
(c) Map modifiers to adjunct positions.
(d) Map the dominating head to the phrasal headposition.G is used for the second half of translation (i.e., mappingto the target-language structure); we also need an in-verse routine that maps syntactic positions of the source-language structure to the CLCS positions:Inverse  L inking Rout ine  G-l:(a) Map the external argument to the logical sub-ject position.
(b) Map the internal arguments to non-logical-subject positions.
(c) Map adjuncts to modifier positions.
(d) Map the phrasal head to the dominating headnode.In terms of the representation shown in (4), theand ~-1 mappings would be defined as shownin figure 2.12,1s'14 Note that wl, zlt .

We will then See how the generallinking routines described here take the syntactic mech-anisms into account in order to derive the appropriateresult.4.1 Divergent Argument  PosltioningsIn order to account for the thematic revcrsa3 that showsup in the gustar-l~e example of (1), we must have amechanism for mapping CLCS axgumcnts to differentsyntactic positions.
In terms of the CLCS,  we need toallow the syntactic realization of the logical subject wand the syntactic realization of a non-subject argument(say zk) to switch places between the source and targetlanguage.Figure 3 shows how this type of argument reversal isachieved.
The :INT and :EXT  markets axe used in theRLCS specifications as override markers for the G andG-I routines: the :INT marker is used to map the logi-ca3 subject of the CLCS to an internal syntactic position(and vice versa).
Thus, steps (a) and (b) of ~ and g-zare activated differently if the RLCS associated with thephrasal head contains either of the :INT or :EXT  over-ride mechanisms.
Note that the CLCS is the same for12The convention adopted in this paper is to use ul for thesource-language realization, and url for the target-languagerealization for a CLCS argument u.13Adjunction has been placed to the right at the maximallevel.
However, this is not the general case.
A parametersetting determines the side and level at which a particu-lar adjunct will occur (as discussed in \[Doff, 1990\]).
Theconfiguration shown corresponds to the spec-initial/head-initial case.

Regardless of these syntactic vari-ations, the ~ and ~-  routines operate uniformly becausethey are language-independent.
For simplicity, the spec-inltlal/head-initial configuration will be used for the rest ofthis paper.X~In addition to realization of arguments, the dominatingCLCS head (~P) must also be realized as a lexical word (PIin the SOVLrce language and ~P, in the target language).
Thesyntactic ategory of this lexical word is X, and the maximalprojection is Y-MAX.
In general, Y = X unless X is a Verb(in which case, Y is the Inflection category).

is'Is Because the Spanish RLCSincludes the :INT and :EXT  markers, the G-z routineactivates steps (a) and (b) differently: the external argu-ment Marfa is mapped to a non-logical-subject position\[Thins PERSON\],  and the internal argument mlis mappedto the logical subject position \[Thi, g REFERENT\ ] .
BylSBecause of space limitations, we will illustrate the threeexamples (I), (2), and (3) in one direction only.
However,it should be clear that the thematic dlvergcnces are solvedgoing in the opposite direction as well since the g and g-1mappings are reversible.18A shorthand notation is being used for the RLCS's andthe CLCS.
See section 2 for a description of the actual rep-resentations used by the system.contrast, the English RLCS does not include any spe-cial markers.
Thus, the G routine activates teps (a)and (b) normally: the logical subject \[Thi.g REFERENT\]is mapped to the external argument I ,  and the non-logical-subject \[Thl,s PERSON\] is mapped to the internalposition Mary.Now we have seen how argument positioning diver-gences are solved during the translation processJ ?
Inthe next section, we will look at how we account for thesecond part of thematic divergences: different predicatepositionings.4.2 D ivergent  P red icate  Pos i t ion ingsIn the last section, we concentrated primarily on the-matic interchange of arguments.
In this section, we willconcentrate on thematic interchange of predicates.
Inso doing, we will have accounted for the entire space ofthematic divergences.There are two ways to be in a predicate-argument rela-tionship: the first is by complementation, and the secondis by adjunction.
That is, syntactic phrases include base-generated complements and base-generated adjuncts,both of which participate in a predicate-argument struc-ture (where the predicate is the head that subcategori~.esfor the base-generated complement or adjunct), tsIn order to show how predicate divergences aresolved, we must enumerate all possible source-language/target-language pr dicate positionings withrespect to arguments z~, z2, .

Rather, the syntacticstructures are derived procedurally on the basis of two piecesof information: lexical entries (i.e., the RLCS's) and the re-sult of composing the RLCS's into a single unit (i.e., theCLCS).
It would not be possible to map declarativelp, i.e.,from a set of static source-language frames to a set of statictarget-language frames.
This is because the ~ and ~-1 rou-tines are intended to operate recursively: an argument thatoccurs in a divergent phrasal construction might itself be adivergent phrasal construction.
For example, in the sentencele saele gustar leer a Jnan ('John usually likes to read'), thereis a simultaneous occurrence of two types of divergences: theverb soler exhibits a predicate positioning divergence withrespect o its complement gustar leer a Juan, which itself ex-hibits an argument positioning divergence.
The proceduralmappings described here are crucial for handling such cases.iSWe have left out the possibility of a base-generated spec-ifier as a participant in the predicate-argument relationship.Of course, the specifier is an argument to the predicate, butit turns out that the syntactic specifier, which corresponds tothe logical subject in the LCS, has a special status, and doesnot participate in predicate divergences in the same way assyntactic omplements and adjuncts.
This will be illustratedshortly.

The source-language/target-languagepredicate positionings for these two cases are representedas shown in figure 5.
Part (a) of this figure accounts forthe translation of usually to soler (or vice versa), andpart (b) accounts for the translation of like to gem (orvice versa).The ~ and ~-1 routines do not take into account hepredicate divergences that were just presented.
As in thecase of argument divergences, predicate divergences re-quire override markers.
The :PROMOTE marker is usedto map a modifier of the CLCS to a syntactic head posi-tion (and vice versa).
The :DEMOTE marker is used tomap a non-subject argument of the CLCS to a syntac-tic head position (and vice versa).
Thus, steps (c), and19 There is not enough space to elaborate on this claim here.See \[Doff, 1990\] for a detailed iscussion of what the possiblepositionings are, and which ones make sense in the contextof linguistic structure.RLCS entry for ir :\[GO /Xl \[To \[AT \[Xl \[VilliRLCS entry for go:log IX\] \[TO \[AT \[Xl \[YIIIIRLCS entry for soler:\[HABITUALLY :PROMOTE\]RLCS entry for usually.\[HABITUALLY\]{I-MAX IN-MAX Juan\]IV-MAX \[V-MIN suele\] .

The so-lution has been implemented in UNITRAN, a bidirec-tional system currently operating on Spanish, English,and German, running in Commonlisp on a Symbolics3600 series machine.
We have seen that the proceduresinvolved are general enough to operate uniformly acrossdifferent languages and divergence types.
Furthermore,the entire space of thematic divergence possibilities is134Figure 7: Translation of Ich habe Marie gemcovered in this approach without recourse to language-specific routines or transfer ules.
In addition to the-matic divergences, the system handles the other diver-gence types shown in figure 1, and it is expected thatadditional divergence types will be handled by means ofequally principled methods.6 REFERENCES\[Brown, 1974\] Gretchen Brown, "Some Problems in Germanto English Machine Translation," MAC Technical Report142, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA,1974.\[Chomsky, 1986\] NoRm A.
