Ontological PromiscuityJerry R. HobbsArtificial Intell igence CenterSRI InternationalandCenter for the Study of Language and InformationStanford UniversityAbstractTo facilitate work in discourse interpretation, the logical form ofEnglish sentences should be both close to English and syntacti-cally simple.
In this paper i propose s logical notation which isfirst-order and uonintensional, sad for which semantic tnmsla-tion can be naively compositional.
The key move is to expandwhat kinds of entities one allows in one's ontology, rather thancomplicating the logical notation, the logical form of sentences,or the semantic translation process.
Three classical problems -opaque adverbials, the distinction between de re and de dittobelief reports, and the problem of identity in intensional con-texts - are examined for the dil~cuities they pose for this logicalnotation, and it is shown that the difficulties can be overcome.The paper closes with s statement about the view of semanticsthat is presupposed by this appro,-'h.1 MotivationThe real problem in natural language processing is the inter-pretation of discourse.
Therefore, the other aspects of the totalprocess hould be in the service of discourse interpretation.
Thisincludes the semantic translation of sentences into s logical form,and indeed the logical notation itsel?
Discourse interpretationprocesses, as !
see them, are inferential processes that manipu-late or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding theinformation in the text and on other logical expressions encodingthe speaker's and helper's background knowledge.
These con-siderations lead to two principal criteria for ?
logical notation.Criterion I: The notation should be as close to English aspossible.
This makes it easier to specify the rules for translationbetween English and the formal language, mad also makes iteasier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of inEnglish.
The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself, butit fails monumentally on the second criterion.Criterion lh The notation should be syntactically simple.Since discourse processes are to be defined primarily in termsof manipulations performed on expressions in the logical nota-tion, the simpler that notation, the easier it will be to define thediscourse operations.The development of such a logical notation is usually takento be a very hard problem, i believe this is because researchershave imposed upon themselves several additional constraints -to adhere to stringent ontological scruples, to explain a numberof mysterious yntactic facts ms a by-product of the notation,and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation.Most representational difficulties go ?way if one rejects theseconstraints, and there are good reasons for rejecting each of theconstr~nts.Ontological scruples: Researchers in philosophy and lint~uis-tics have typically restricted themselves to very few (altho*Igh?
strange assortment of) kinds of entities - physical objects,numbers, sets, times, possible worlds, propositions, events, andsituations - mad all of these but the first have been controversial.Quine has been the greatest exponent of ontological chastity, illsargument is that in any scientific theory, "we adopt, at \[east in-sofas* as we are reasonable, the simplest conceptual scheme intowhich the disordered fragments of our experience can be fittedand arranged.
* (Quine, 1953, p.
16.)
But he goes on to saythat "simplicity ... is not a clear and unambiguous idea; and itis quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.
"(Ibid., p.
17.)
Minimising kinds of entities is not the only wayto achieve simplicity in a theory.
The aim in this enterprise isto achieve simplicity by minimizing the complexity of the rulesin the system.
It turns out this can be achieved by multiplyingkinds of entities, by' allowing as an entity everything that can bereferred to by a noun phrase.Syntactic explanation: The argument here is easy.
It wouldbe pleasant if an explanation of, say, the syntactic behavior ofcount nouns and mass nouns fell out of our underlying onto-logical structure at no extra cost, but if the extra cost is greatcomplication in statements of discourse operations, it would bequite unpleasant.
In constructing a theory of discourse interpre-tation, it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiringsyntsctie explanations as well.
The problem of discourse is atleast an order of maguitude harder than the problem of syntax,and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat.Efficient deduction: There is ?
long tradition in artificialintelligence of building control information into the notation.and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven bythis consideration.
Semantic networks and other notational sys-tems built ,round hierarchies (Quillian, 1068; .~immons, 1973;Hendrix, 1975) implicitly assign a low cost to certain typesof syllogistic remmning.
The KL-ONE representation language(Schmolze and Brat.brunn, 1982) has a variety of notational de-vices, each with an associated efficient deduction procedure.Hayes (1979) has argued that frame representations (Minsky,1975; Bobrow and Winogrsd, 1977) should be viewed am setsof predicate calculus axioms together with a control componentfor drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly.
In quite a differ-ent vein, Moore (1980) uses a possible worlds notation to modelknowledge mad action in part to avoid inefficiencies in theorem-proving.By contrast, l would argue against building et?ciencies intothe notation.
From a psychological point of view, this allows usto abstract away from the details of implementation a partic-ular computational device, increasing the generality of the the-ory.
From a technological point of view, it reflects a belief thatwe must first determine mpirically the must common classes ofinferences required for discourse processing and only then seekalgorithms for optimizing them.In this paper I propme s fl it logical notation with an ontolog-ically promiscuous semantics.
One's first naive guess as to howto represent a simple sentence likeA boy builds s boat.is as follows:(3z, y)build(z, g) A boy(z) ^  boat(v)This simple approach seems to break down when we encounterthe more d i tcu i t  phenomena of natural language, like tense,intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentenceA boy wanted to build a boat quickly.These phenomena have led students of language to introducesignificant complications in their logical notations for represent-ing sentences.
My approach will be to maintain the syntacticsimplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of theworld implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity.The representation f the =hove sentence, as is justified below,is(::lCl, ?Z, el, Z, V) Past(el  )AwnnLl(et, Z, ez)Aquiekl(e2, us)Abmld~(es, z g) A bey(z) A boat(g)That is, el occurred in the peat, where el is z's wanting e~,which is the quickness of us, which is z's building of y, where zis a boy and y is a boat.In brief, the logical form of natural anguage sentences will bea conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables areexistentially quantified with the widest poesible scope.
Predi-cates will be identical or nearly identical to natural languagemorphemes.
There will be no ftmctious, fun?
*ionals, nestedquantifiers, disjunctions, negations, or modal or inteusional operators.3 The Logical NotationDavidson (1967) proposed a treatment of action sentences inwhich events are treated as individuals.
This facilitated therepresentation f sentences with time and place adverbials.
Thuswe can view the sentencesJohn ran on Monday.John ran in Sin Fnmciaco.as mmerting the existence of & ruxming event by John and assert-ing a relation between the event and Monday or San Francisco.We can similarly view the sentenceJohn ran slowly.as expressing an attribute about a running event.
Treatingevents as individuals is abe useful beemme they can be acgu-merits of statements about cremes:Because he wanted to get there first, John ran.Because John ran, he arrived sooner than anyone else.They can be the objects of propositional attitudes:Bill was surprised that John ran.Finally, this approach accomodates the facts that events can benominalized and can be referred to pronominally:John's running tired him out.John ran, and Bill saw it.But virtually every predication that can he made in naturallanguage can be specified u to time and place, be modifiedadverbially, function a~ a cause or effect of something else, bethe object of a propositional attitude, be nominalized, and bereferred to by a pronoun.
It is therefore convenient to extendDavidson's approach to all predications.
That is, correspondingto any predication that can he made in natural lan~tage, wewill say there is an event, or state, or condition, or sitl=ation.or "eventual i ty ' ,  or whatever, in the world that it refer~ to.This approach might he called "ontnlogical promiscuity' .
0 l ieabandons all ontological scruples.Thus we would like to have in our logical notation the possi-bi l i ty of an extra argument in e~h predication referring to the"condition" that exists when that predication is true.
However.especially for expository convenience, we would like to retainthe option of not specifying that extra argument when it is notneeded and would only get in our way.
Ilence, I propose a logicalnotation that provides two sets of predicates fhat are ~ystem-atically related, by introducing what might I)e railed a "nomi-nalization" operator '.
(:orresponding lu every rl-ary predicatep there will he an n + I-ary predicalc i ~t who.~e (i~t argqlnlenlcan he thought of a.~ the condil ion that }mhl~ '*hen p is rnwof the suhsequent ar~lments.
Thus.
if r .
.
( J )  me,~ns that .Johnruns, run ' (E ,  J) means that /': is a running event hy ,John.
orJohn's running, if slipperv(F ) means that floor F is slippery,then Jlipperv~(E, F) means that ~" is the condition of F's beingslippery, or F's slipperiness.
The effect of this notational ma-neuver is to provide handles by which various predications canbe grasped by higher predications.
A similar approach haL~ beenin many AI systems.In discourse one not only makes predications about such ephe-mera as events, states and conditions.
One also refers to crttitiesthat do not actually exist.
Our notation must thus have a wayof referring to such entities.
We therefore take our model to he aPlatonic universe which contains everything that can he spokenof - objects, events, states, conditions - whether they exist inthe real world or not.
It then may or may not be a property ofsuch entities that they exist in the real world.
In the sentence( l ) John worships Zeus,the worshipping event and John, but not Zeus, exist in the realworld, but all three exist in the (overpopulated) Platonic uni-veto.
Similarly, inJohn wants to fly.62John's flying exists in the Platonic universe but not in the realworld.
l "The logical notation then is just first-order predicate calculus,where the universe of discourse is a rich set of individuals, whichare real, possible auad even impossible objects, events, conditions,eventualities, and so on.Existence and truth in the actual universe are treated as pred-ications about individuals in the Platonic universe.
For this pur-pose, we use a predicate Ezist.
The formula Ez is t ( JO l lN)  saysthat the individual in the Platonic universe denoted by JOHNexists in the actual universe, s The formula(2) Ezist{g)  ^  run ' (E ,  JOHN)says that the condition E of John's r~mning exists in the ac-tual universe, or more simply that "John rains" is true, or stillmore simply, that John runs.
A shorter way to write it isrun( JO lf N).Although for a simple sentence like "John rmls ~, a logical formlike (2) seems a bit overblown, when we rome to real sentencesin English discourse with their variety of tenses, modalities andadverbial modifiers, the more elaborated logical form is neces-sary.
Adopting the notation of (2) has Hw eth,ct of splitting asentence into its propositional content - run'(L', JOHN)  andits assertional claim - gzist(E) .
This frequently turns out tobe useful, as the latter is often in doubt until substantial workhas been done by discourse interpretation processes.
An entiresentence may be embedded within aa indirect proof or otherextended counts{factual.We are now in a position to state formally the systematic re-lation between the unprimed and primed prrt l icat~ as an axiomschema.

When the ex-istence of the condition corresponding to some predication im-plies the existence of one of the arguments of the predication, wewill say that the predicate is transparent in that argument, andopaque otherwise, i Thus, worship and want are transparent intheir first arguments and opaque in their secottd arguments.

\[am indebted to Paul Martin fur calling it to lily &ttentl,~n,83NS and the at relation E4, which in turn implies the existenceof the veto and the meeting.
These then imply the existence ofMargaret Thatcher MT and President Mitterand PM,  but notthe Channel Tunnel CT. Of course, we know about the exis-tence of some of these entities, such ms Margaret Thatcher andPresident Mitterand, for reasons other than the transparency ofpredicates.Sentence (4) shows that virtually anything can be embeddedin a higher predication.
This is the reason, in the logical nots-tins, for flattening everything into predications about individu-Ms.There are four serious problems that must be dealt with ifthis approach is to work - quantifiers, opaque adverbials, thedistinction between de re and de ditto readings of belief reports,and the problem of identity in intensional contexts.I have described a solution to the quantifier problem else-where (Hobbs, 1983).
Briefly, universally quantified variablesare reified ms typical elements of sets, existential quantificationinside the scope of universally quantified variables are handledby means of dependency functions, and the quantifier structureof sentences i encoded in indices on predicates.
In this paper iwill address only the other three problems in detail.3 Opaque Adverbials\[t seems reasonably natural to treat transparent adverbials asproperties of events.
For opaque adverbials, like "almost", itseems lees natural, and one is inclined to follow Reichenbach(1947} in treating them ms ftmctionais mapping predicates intopredicates.
Thus,John is almost a man.would he representedalmo,t( man )( J )That is, almos~ maps the predicate man into the predicate "al-most a man' ,  which is then applied to John.This representation is undesirable for our purposes ince it isnot first-order.
It would be preferable to treat opaque operatorsas we do transparent ones, ms properties of events or conditions.The sentence would be representedalmost(E) A manl( E, J)But does this get as into dil~cuity?First note that this representation does not imply that Johnis a man, for we have not asserted g 's  existence in the realworld, and almo,t is opaque and does not imply its argument'sexistence.But is there enough information in E to allow one to determinethe truth value of aimomt(E) in isolation; without appeal toother facts?
The answer is that there could he.
We can constructa model i~ which for every functional F there is a correspondingequivalent predicate q, such that(vp, ~(F (p) (z )  -- (-3s)q(~) ^  p'(e, : ) )The existence of the model shows that this condition is not nec-essarily contradictory.Let the ,miverse of discourse D be the class of finite sets builtout of a finite set of urelements.
The interpretation ofa constantX will be some element of D; call it I (X).
The interpretationof s monsdic predicate p will a subset of D; call it lip).
Thenif E is such that p'(E, X), we define the interpretation of E tobe < l(p), \ [ (X) >.Now suppose we have a functional F mapping predicates intopredicates.
We can define the corresponding predicate q to besuch thatq(E) is true iff there are a predicate p and a constantX where the interpretation of E is < I(p), \[(X) >and F(p)(X) is true.The fact that we can define such a predicate q in a moderatelyrich model means that we are licensed to treat opaque adverbialsas properties of events and conditions.The purpose of this exercise is only to show the viability ofthe approach.
I am not claiming that a running event *8 anordered pair of the runner and the .set of all runners, althoughit should he harmless enough for those irredeemably committedto set-theoretic semantics to view it like that.It should be noted that this treatment of adverbials has con-sequences for the individuating criteria on eventualities.
We cansay "John is almost a man ~ without wishing to imply "John isalmost a mammal," so we would not want to say that John's be-ing a man is the same condition as his being a mammal.
We areforced, though not unwillingly, into a position of individuatingeventualities ,,,'cording to very fine-grained criteria.4 De Re and De Dicto Belief ReportsThe next problem concerns the distinction (due to Quine (19.56))between de re and de ditto belief reports.
A belief report like(5) John believes a man at the next table is a spy.has two interpretations.
The de dieto interpretation is likely inthe circumstmace in which John and some man are at adjacenttables and John observes uspicious behavior.
The de re inter.pretat ion is l ikely i f  some man is s i t t ing at the table next to thespeaker of the sentence, and John is nowhere around but knowsthe man otherwise and suspects him to be a spy.
A sentencethat very nearly forces the de re reading isJohn believes Bill's mistress is Bill's wife/whereas the sentenceJohn believes Russian consulate mployees are spies.strongly indicates a de ditto reading.
In the tie re reading of(5), John is not necessarily taken to know that the man is infact at the next table, but he is normally a.ssumed to be able toidentify the man somehow.
More on ~identil'y" below.
In the dedivan reading John believes there is a man who is both at thenext table and t spy, but may be otherwise unable to identifythe man.
The de re reading of (5) is usually taken to supportthe inference(6) There is someone John believes to be a spy.whereas the de ditto reading supports the weaker inference(7) John believes that someone is a spy.YThi- ,~x"~mple is due to Moore and Hendrix (1982).64As Quine has pointed out, as usually interpreted, the first ofthese sentences is false for most of us, the second one true.
Acommon notational maneuver (though one that Quine rejects)is to represent this distinction as a scope ambigafity.
Sentence(6) is encoded as (8) and (7) as (9):(8) (~z)believe(J, spy(z))(9) believe(J, (3z)spy(z) )If one adopts this notation and stipulates what the expressionsmean, then there are certainly distinct ways of representing thetwo sentences.
But the interpretation of the two expressionsis not obvious.
It is not obvious for example that (8) couldnot cover the case where there is an individual such that Johnbelieves him to be a spy but has never seen him and knowsabsolutely nothing else about him - not his name, nor his ap-pearance, nor his location at any point in time - beyond the factthat he is a spy.In fact.
the notation we propose takes (8) to be the mostneutral representation.
Since quantification is over entities inthe Platonic universe, (8) says that there is some ent i ty in thePlatonic universe such that John believes of that.
entity that itis a spy.
Expression (8) commits us to no other beliefs on thepart of .John.
When understood in this way, expression (8) isa representation of what is conveyed in a de ditto belief report.Translated into the flat notation and introducing a constant forthe existentially quantified variable.
(8) becomes(10) believe{J. P) A spy'(P.S)Anything else that John believes about this entity must bestated explicitly.
In particular, the de dieto reading of (5) wouldbe represented by something like(11) believe(J, P) A spy'(P, S) A believe( J, Q) A at'(Q, S, T)where T is the next table.
That is, John believes that S is aspy and that .q is at the next table.
John may know many otherpropcriies about S and still fall short of knowing ,rho the spyis.
There is a range of possibilities for John's knowledge, fromthe bare statements of (lO) and ( I t )  that correspond to a ,leditto reading to the full-blown knowledge of S's hh'ntity that isnormally present in a de re reading.
In fact, an FBI agent wouldprogress through just such a range of belief states on his way toidentifying the spy.To state John's knowledge of S's identity properly, we wo*tldhave to state explicitly John's belief in a potentially very largecollection of properties of the spy.
To arrive at a succinct way ofrepresenting knowledge of identity in our notation, let us con.sider the two pairs of equivalent sentences:What is that?Identify that.The FBI doesn't  know who the spy is.The FBI doesn't  know the spy's identity.The answer to the question "Who are you?"
and what is re-quired before we can say that we know who someone is or thatwe know their identity is a highly context-dependent matter.Several years ago, before I had ever seen Kripke, if someone hadasked me whether I knew who Saul Kripke was, I would havesaid, ~Yes.
tle's the author of Naming and Neeessd~.
Thenonce !
was at a workshop which I knew was being attended byKripke, but I didn't  yet know what he looked like.
If someonehad asked me whether I knew who Kripke was, I would have hadto say, "No.
* The relevant property in that context, was not, hisauthorship of some paper, but any property that distinguishedhim from the others present, such as "the malt in the back rowholding a cup of coffee*.Knowledge of a person's identity is then a matter of know-ing some context-dependent essential property that serves toidentify that person for present purposes - that is, a matter ofknowing who he or she is.Therefore, we need a kind of place-holder predicate to standfor this essential property, that in any particular context canbe specified more precisely.
It happens that English has a mor-pheme that serves just this function - the morplwme "wh"  Letus then posit a predicate u,h that stands for the contextually ,te-termined property or conjunction of properfes that wotild coiultas an identification in that particular context.The de re reading of (5) is generally taken to include John'sknowledge of the identity of the alh'd~cd spy.
Assuming this,a de re belief report would be represented a.s a conjunction oftwo beliefs, one for the main predication and the other express-ing knowledge of the es~,,ntial properly.

of the literal meaning of thesentenc;e.85John doesn't know that the man is at the next table, there mustbe some other description under which John is familiar with theman.
The story I just told provides uch a description, but notone sufficient for identifying the man.This analysis is attractive since it allows us to view the de re -de dicto distinction problem u just one instance of a much moregeneral problem, namely, the existential status of the grammat-ically subordinated material in sentences.
Generally, such ma-terial takes on the tense of the sentence.
Thus, inThe boy built the boat.a building event by z of y takes place in the past, and we assumethat a was a boy in the past, at the time of the building.
But inMany rich men studied computer science in college.the most natural reading is not that the men were rich when theywere studying computer science but that they are rich now.
InThe flower is artificial.there is an entity z which is described as a flower, and z exists,but its "flower-hess" does not exist in the real world.
Rather,it is a condition which is embedded in the opaque predicate"artificial'.It was stated above that the representation (10) for the deditto reading conveys no properties of S other than that Johnbelieves him to be a spy.
In particular, it does not convey S'sexistence in the real world.
S thus refers to a possible individual,who may turn out to be ,wtual if, for example, John ever comesto be able to identify the person whom he believes to be the spy,or if there is some actual spy who has given John good cause forhis suspicions.However, S may not be actual, only possible.
Suppose this isthe case.
One common objection to possible individuals is thatthey may seem to violate the Law of the Excluded Middle.
IsS married or not married?
Our intuition is that the questionis inappropriate, and indeed the answer given in our formalismhas this flavor.
By axiom (3), married(S) is really just an ab-breviation for married'( g, S) ^ gzist(E).
This is false, for theexistence of E in the real world would imply the existence of S.So married(S) is also false.
But its falsity has nothing to dowith S's marital status, only his existential status.
The predi-cation unmarried(S) is false for the same reason.
The primedpredicates are basic, and for them the problem of the excludedmiddle does not arise.
The predication maeried'(E, S) is trueor false depending on whether E is the condition of S's beingmarried.
An unprimed, trmxsparent predicate carries along withit the existence of its arguments, and it can fail to be true ofan entity either through the entity being actual but not havingthat property or through the nonexistence of the entity.5 Identity in Bel ief  ContextsThe final problem I will consider arises in de dieto belief reports.It is the problem of identity in intensional contexts, raised bygrege (1892).
One way of stating the problem is this.
Why is itthat if(14) John believes the Evening Star is rising.and if the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star, it isnot necessarily true that(15) John believes the Morning Star is rising.By Leibniz's Law, we ought to be able to substitute for an entityany entity that is identical to it.This puzzle survives translation into the logical notation, ifJohn knows of the existence of the Morning Star and if propernames are unique.
The representation for (the de dicto readingof) sentence (14) is(16) believe(J, P, ) A rise:( FI, ES) A believe( J, Q t)AEveninpStar:(QI, ES)John's belief in the Morning Star would he representedbelieve(J, Q2) A Morning.Star:(Q2, MS)The existence of the Evening Star and the Moromg Star is ex-pressed byEzist(Qi)  ^  Ezist(Q2)The uniqueness of the proper name "Evening Star" is expressedby the axiom(Vz, y)Evenin?-Star(z) A Evensn?-Star(y) D .z = yThe identity of the Evening Star and the Morning Star is ex-pressed(V~)Eoening-,~;lar(~) ---- Aforning-b'tar(z)From all of this we can infer that the Morning Star M,q is alsoan Evening Star and hence is identical to ES;, and hence can besubstituted into ri.se'(Pi, E.S') to give rise'(PI, MS).
Then wehavebelieve( J, P, ) A vine'( P,, M S ) A believe( J, Q: )AMorning-b'tar'(Q:, MS)This is a representation for tile paradoxical sentence (15).There are three possibilities for dealing with this proi)lem.The first is to discard or restrict I,eibniz's Law.
The second is todeny that the Evening ~tar and the Morning Star are identical a.sentities in the Platonic universe; they only happen to he identicalin the real world, and that is not sullieient for intersubstitutivityThe third is to deny that expression (16) represents ~entence(14) because "the Evening Star" in (14) does not refer to whatit seems to refer to.The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treatbelief as an operator rather than as a predicate, and then re.strict substitution inside the operator.
~ We cannot avail our-selves of this.
solution bec.ause of the flatness of our notation.The predicate rtse is surely referentially transparent, so if ESand MS are identical, M,S" can he substituted for E:S in theexpression rine'(l'l,Eb') to give rtse'(l'\].M.S').
Then the ex-pression belier,e( J, I'1) wouhl not even require substitution to hea belief about the Morning Star.In any case, this approach does not seem wise in view ofthe central importance played ia discourse interpretation by theidentity of differently presented entities, i.e.
by coreference.
Freeintersubstitutibility of identicals eems a desirable property topreser'se.The second possible answer to Frege's problem is to say thatin the Platonic universe, the Morning Star and the Evening Star*This ia a purely syntactic approach, and whPn one tries to construct ?semantics for it, one is generally driven to the third possibility.86are different entities.
It just happens chu in the res/world theyare idemical.
But it is not true that E$  = MS, for equality, likequantification, is over entities in the Platonic universe.
The factthat E,.~ and MS ate identical in the real wodd (call this relationrw-identicai) must be stated explicitly, say, by the expressionr~-identical( E S, MS)or more properly,(~:, ~t)Moming-Star(:) A Euenin~.Stav(y)D r~.4dcntical(z, If)For reuonin~ shout "r~-idmtical" entities, thm~ is, Platonicentities th~ mrs identical in the real world, we may cake the fol-Iowin~ approach- Substitution in re(erenmdly trsmsparent con-texts wonld be ,z:hieved by ~so o( the sx/om schema(17) (Vel, es.

That is, if et is p's being true of{S ~ e$ ~ e4 SA'~ identical in the real world, then there is acondition ?z o(p's bein~ true of e4, ~ ez is identical to e~ in thereal worid.

We mnstthus restate the axiom for \[he umqueness o( proper uames a=(V=, y)Evenin~.Star(=) ^ Eveninf-Star(v)3 r~.ident,cal(z, ~)A similar modification mus, be made for functions.

For "=*" we substitute the relation r~;-qden~,cad, ~md bymeans of axiom schema (17), we force substitutions co propagateto the eventualities they occur in, and we force the distinctionbetween referentially transparent and referentially opaque predi-cates to be made explicitly.
It is thus an indirect way of rejectingL,eibnis' Law.The third solution is to say that "the Eveninf Star* in sen-tents (14) does not really refer to the Evening Star, but co someabstract entity somehow related to the Evenin~ Star.
That is.sentence (14) is re-fly en example of metonymy.
This may seemcounterintuitive, sad even bizarre, at first blush.
But in factthe most widely *,'espied clmmical solutions to the problem ofidentiw ate of thn, flavor.
Foe Fre~e (1892) "the Evening Star ~in sentence (14) does no* refer co the Evenin~ Star but co thetenme of the phrsac "the Evening Star ~.
\[n a more recent ap-proar.h, Zalta (1983) ts~es such noun phrases co refer co "ab-strict objects" related to the resJ object.
In both approachesnoun phrues in intemional context~ refer co senses or abstractobjects, while other noun phrues refer co actual entities, sad soit is necessary co specify which predicates are intensioa*,l. \[n aManta{avian approach, "the Evening Star" would be taken torefer co the inter.on o( the Evening Star, not its e=te~*on inthe real world, sad noun phrases would al,vays be taken co referco intensions, -Ithough for nonintensional predicates there wouldbe mesmng postulates chat make this equivalent co reference coextensions.Thus, in all these approaches intentional and extensional pred-icates must be distintmished explicitly, sad noun phrs~s in in-tensional contexts are systematically interpreted metonymically.It would be em,y enouch in our framework co implement theseq3proaches.
We c,m define a function a o( three arguments - theactual entity, the co,niter, sad the condition used co describethe entity - chat returns the sense, or intention, or abstractentity, corresponding co the ~ctual entity for chat ?ognizer ~ndthat condition.

Q~.)
where Movninq-StarJ(Q:, ES).
That is.
different~tr 'ac t  objects must correspond co the condition QI of beingthe Evening Star and the coaditioo Q: o( being the MorningStar.
It is because o( this feature ~hat we escape the problem67o( intenmbstitutivity of identieakt, fur substitution o( MS forES in (18) yields "...Ariee/(Pt,a(MS, J Q1))A..." rather than"...Ariee~(Pl,,~(M$, J,Q=)) A...', which would be the represen-tation of sentence (15).The dif~culty with this approach is that it makes the interpee-ration o/" noun phrases dependent on their embedding context:\[ntensionai context  -*  me?onymlc interpretationExtensional  context  - -  noumetonymic  interpretationIt thus violates, though not soriousiy, the nmve com~t iona i i tythat \[ have been at so many pehm to preserve.

The third sppro.-'h suggests a ruse for doing so.
Wecan amume tha~, in general, (16) is the representation f sen-tence (14).
We invoke no extra complications where we don'thave to.
When, in interpreting the text, we encounter a dif-ficulty resulting from the problem o/' identity, we can go backand revise our in~rprocatmn o((14), by mmuming the referencermmt have been a metonymie one to the sbstr-,'t entity and notto the actual entity.
In theee cm it would be ts if we m'e say-ing, "John couldn't believe about the Evening Star itself that itis rising.
The par'edox shows that he is insufficiently acquamtedwith the Evening Star to refer to it ~metly.
