Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 652?656,Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014.ThinkMiners: Disorder Recognition using Conditional Random Fieldsand Distributional SemanticsAnkur Parikh Avinesh PVS Joy Mustafi Lalit Agarwalla Ashish MungiIBM India Pvt Ltd, IBM Software Group, Watson{anparikh,pavinesh,jmustafi,lalit.agarwalla,r1amungi}@in.ibm.comAbstractIn 2014, SemEval organized multiple chal-lenges on natural language processing andinformation retrieval.
One of the task wasanalysis of the clinical text.
This challengeis further divided into two tasks.
The taskA of the challenge was to extract disor-der mention spans in the clinical text andthe task B was to map each of the disor-der mentions to a unique Unified MedicalLanguage System Concept Unique Iden-tifier.
We participated in the task A anddeveloped a clinical disorder recognitionsystem.
The proposed system consists ofa Conditional Random Fields based ap-proach to recognize disorder entities.
TheSemEval challenge organizers manuallyannotated disorder entities in 298 clini-cal notes, of which 199 notes were usedfor training and 99 for development.
Onthe test data, our system achieved the F-measure of 0.844 for entity recognition inrelaxed and 0.689 in strict evaluation.Keywords: medical language processing,clinical concept extraction, conditionalrandom fields.1 IntroductionMining concepts from the electronic medicalrecords such as clinical reports, discharge sum-maries as well as large number of doctor?s noteshas become an utmost important task for auto-matic analysis in the medical domain.

In Section 2 we givea background of the existing solutions to tacklethe problem.
Section 3 covers our approach indetail, followed by evaluation and conclusion inSection 4 and Section 5 respectively.2 BackgroundIn recent times, many systems have been de-veloped to extract clinical concepts from vari-ous types of clinical notes.
The earlier nat-ural language processing (NLP) systems weremainly built heavily using domain knowledgei.e.
medical dictionaries.
These systems in-clude MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010), Hi-TEX (Zeng et al., 2006), KnowledgeMap (Dennyet al., 2003), MedLEE (Friedman et al., 1994),SymText (Koehler, 1994) and Mplus (Christensenet al., 2002).
In the past couple of years, re-searchers have been exploring the use of machinelearning algorithms in the clinical concept detec-tion.
To promote the research in this field many or-ganizations such as ShARe/CLEF, SemEval haveorganized a few clinical NLP challenges.
In CLEF2013 (Pradhan et al., 2013), the challenge was torecognize medication-related concepts.
Both rule-based (Fan et al., 2013; Ramanan et al., 2013;Wang and Akella, 2013) and machine learningbased methods as well as hybrid methods (Xiaet al., 2013; Osborne et al., 2013; Hervas et al.,2013) were developed.
In this shared-task sequen-tial labeling algorithms (i.e., Conditional RandomFields (CRF)) (Gung, 2013; Patrick et al., 2013;Bodnari et al., 2013; Zuccon et al., 2013) and ma-chine learning methods (i.e., Support Vector Ma-chine (SVM)) (Cogley et al., 2013) have beendemonstrated to achieve promising performancewhen provided with a large annotated corpus for652Figure 1: Dataset distributiontraining.3 ApproachEntity recognition has been tried in various do-mains like news articles, Wikipedia, sports arti-cles, financial reports and clinical texts.
In clinicaltext, entities can vary from medical procedures,disorders, body site indicators etc.
Clinical textalso presents with a peculiar concept of disjointdisorders/entities.
This phenomenon is commonin clinical domain compared to others and furthercomplicates entity extraction from clinical notes.3.1 DataThe data consisted of around 298 notes from dif-ferent clinical types including radiology reports,discharge summaries, ECG and ECHO reports.For each note, disorder entities were annotatedbased on a pre-defined guidelines.
The data setwas further divided into two, with 199 notes in thetraining set and 99 notes in the development set.The training set contains 5811 disorders where asthe development contained 5340 disorders.
Figure1 shows the distribution of the training and devel-opment set respectively.3.2 Data PreprocessingIn the pre-processing step we tokenized, lemma-tized and tagged the text with part of speech us-ing the Apache cTAKES1(Savova et al., 2010).Further, section and source meta data extraction isdone for the text in the documents.In Named Entity Recognition (NER), whensolved using machine learning, the text is typicallyconverted to BIO format (Beginning, Inside andOutside the entity).
BIO representation means the1https://ctakes.apache.org/words in the text are assigned one of the follow-ing tags B - begin, I - inside and O - outside of theentity i.e.
in this case a disorder.
So now the taskof NER is a sequence labeling problem to assignthe labels to the tokens.
Especially in the medicaldomain, the challenge is more complicated due tothe presence of disjoint disorders (<10%), whichcould not be solved using the traditional BIO-notation.
BIO approach works well with entitieswhich are consecutive.
So, we took an enhancedapproach (Tang et al., 2013a) where the consec-utive disorders are assigned traditional BIO tagsand for disjoint disorders we create two tag sets a)D{B,I} : for disjoint entity words which are notshared by multiple concepts; and b) H{B,I}: fordisjoint entity words which belong to more thanone disjoint concept.The following examples show the annotationsof consecutive as well as disjoint disorders.1: ?The left atrium is moderately dilated.?
?The/O left/DB atrium/DI is/O moderately/Odilated/DB ./O?2: ?The left & right atrium are moderatelydilated.?
?The/O left/DB &/O right/DB atrium/HB are/Omoderately/O dilated/HB ./O?3.3 Sequence LabelingWe have used Conditional Random Fields (CRF),a popular approach to solve sequence labelingtasks.
CRF++2was used as an implementation ofCRF for our purpose.2http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html653Feature set used for the learning algorithm:?
Word level features: words [-2,2], suffix andprefix.?
Syntactic features: parts-of-speech(POS).?
Discourse features: source & section.
Sen-tence containing disorder mentions usuallyhave similar syntactic patterns based on sec-tions (ex: ?Past Medical History?)
and sourcetype (ex: discharge summary, radiology re-port).
To capture this, source and sectionmeta data have been provided as a feature.?
Distributional semantics: We used a con-textual similarity based approach from thepopular concept called NC-value (Frantzi etal., 2000).We followed the following steps to encap-sulate the distributional semantics into thelearning model:?
For all the disorders in the training datawe created two sets of contextual wordsnamely context before (CBatrain) andcontext after (CAatrain).
These wordsbelong to open class (Noun, Verb, Ad-jective, Adverb) allocated for each sec-tion (Sj).?
Weights are calculated for the contex-tual words.Weight(btrain) =freq(disorders,b)freq(disorders)?
For each word in the test data we createda similar sets of contextual words(CBa,CAa) as above.?
Two scores are calculated for eachtoken based on the product of frequencyof the contextual word per section Sjwith weight calculated of that word inthe training set.For each section (Sj):NC?valueB(a) =XbCBa,Sjfa(btest)?weight(btrain)(1)NC?valueA(a) =XbCAa,Sjfa(btest)?weight(btrain)(2)wherea is the candidate term,CBais the set of context words of ?a?in a window of [-2,0],CAais the set of context words of ?a?in a window of [0,2],Sjis a section like ?Past MedicalHistory?, ?Lab Reports?
etc.b is a word from CBaor CAa,fa(btest) is the frequency of b as a termcontext word of ?a?
in the test set,weight(btrain) is the weight of b as termcontext word of a disorder in thetraining set,NC-valueB(a) is the distributionalsemantic score of contextual wordsbefore the candidate term,NC-valueA(a) is the distributionalsemantic score of contextual wordsafter the candidate term.?
Further a similarity class is calculatedbased on a set of thresholds on theNC-value namely High-Sim, Med-Sim,Low-Sim and assigned to the tokens.Most of the features were similar to that of the pre-vious approaches (Tang et al., 2013a; Tang et al.,2012; Tang et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2011) with anaddition of an innovative distributional semanticsbased features (Nc-valueB, NC-valueA), which wehave tried and tested for concept mining in clinicaltext.4 EvaluationThe evaluation was done in two categories a) strictevaluation: exact match, which requires the start-ing and ending of the concept to be the same asthe gold standard data b) relaxed evaluation: herethe concepts don?t match exactly with the start andend of the concept but may overlap.In the strict and relaxed evaluation, the best F-measure among our system was 0.689, 0.844 with-out the distributional semantics where as best Pre-cision was 0.907, 0.749 with the distributional se-mantics as a feature.
Table 1. shows the detailedresult.5 ConclusionExtraction of the concepts from the medical textis the fundamental task in the process of analysingpatient data.
In this paper we have tried a CRFbased approach to mine the disorder terms fromthe clinical free text.

Ideallythis feature has to improve the results because ittakes contextual features into consideration.
In ouropinion inappropriate scaling of the feature valuesmight have caused the drop.
Further we wouldlike to investigate the use of large unlabeled data,dependency tree based context and more experi-ments have to be carried out like threshold setting,feature value scaling to show better results.
Alsodue to license issues we could not use UMLS dic-tionary.
From our survey we figured out that 2-3%of improvement has been observed when the con-cepts from the dictionary are used.ReferencesB.
