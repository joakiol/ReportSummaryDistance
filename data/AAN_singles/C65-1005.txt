Machine Translation.To translate a special text from one language into anothermeans to construct to the given text in the first language, sucha text in the second-one that has the same ~ (the same istold in it) like the given text.The t_ranslation from a ~tu~al  language L I into a languageis such a function F (in the more general case it is a many-valued function) which assigns to any text T in the languageL I such a text F(T) in the language L2, that F(T) has the samemeaning like To If we introduce a semantics (or interpretation)M as a function (in general also man~-valued) which to any ex~res-sio____~n E of some language L assigns its meaning M\[E~(compare\[~\]) ,it is possible to say that the function F assigning the textsF(T) from L 2 to the texts T from L 1 is the translation only when(1) M\[TJ= M\[F(T)J for any text T from L I.At the machine (or automatic) translation, the matter is,to define the function F as a mechanizable procedure (ioe.algorithm) according to which an arbitrary starting text T in Lis being succedingly modified till we get the translated textF(T) fulfil l ing naturally (I)o The corresponding algorithm canbe finally programmed for a suitable computer.With respect to theused computer, the programme of the algorithm must not be toolong, not even the wide range of memories must not be emploiedand at last the translation must not take up too much of time.Usually it is required for the algorithm of a translation, tobe the most effective.~ul~k 22oTranslation_"Sentence bu sentence"=The translation F is theoretically - as every function -definedtexts in L 1.
If we really had these pairs practically at dis-posal, we could use a trivial algorithm of the translation F~should put in the memory of the computer all the pairs~T,F(T)\] weand when being Riven the starting text T, we should find out inthe memory the pair, in the first place of which T would be si-tuated, thus the pair IT, F(T).\] , and the demanded translationF(T) would be on the second place of this pair?
Thic is, of course,not only funny but also impossible.It seems to be funny because of the fact that to have prac-tically at disposal the pairs IT, F(T) 7 it would mean to use live-ly translation and thus to translate all possible texts in advance.But the automation of translation signifies to exclude as much aspossible the direct intervention of man out of the proceeding ofthe translation and thus to sustitute a man by a machine.
On thatscore, we do not possess practically the pairs ~T,F(T)\] .It seems to be impossible because the texts T are too manu(it would be possible to admit that infinitely many) and the pairsIT, F(T)J could not be included in any computer?
On the other hand,it is necessary to admit that it concerus the algorithm, whichis very simple (only to look up in the memory would take up toomuch of time).The trivial algorithm being practically impossible, it isnecessary to try to decompose long texts into parts and then totranslata part by part.
Naturally, it seems to be profitable,to treat sentences, that are in printed texts distinctly separa-ted by points, as these Darts.
Thus, every text T is a sequence~ulik 3of partial texts, i.eo sentences Sl, $2,...~S k so that we~Tite that T =/SI, S2,o..,Sk) J ?
The function of the maytranslation F is, of course, according to the asumptiondefined for all texts and thereby also for particular sen-tences SI, S2t...,S k so that it is possible to constructa somposed text LF(SI) , F(S2),...~F(Sk) / from the transla-tions of these sentences F(SI) , F (~) ,  ..., F(Sk) , that eresome partial texts in L2?
At the same time, the translations ofsentences follow in the same sequence as did the starting s~nten-ces in the text To It may happen - and we should sure welcome it,if it were always - that it holds(2) F( slos2 o..s k) -IF( s l) ?F( s 2 )o..F(s k) .Ior at least the weaker condition(3) ?From (2) ther~ follows (3) but in no way the contrary?For the translation the condition (3) is sufficient.
It might,namely, happen that we translate the text T, as a whole, different-ly than when translating it succeedingly in parts S1,S2,...,Sk,so that (2) does not hold, but despite this (3) holds.In the condition (2) and similarly the condition (3) werefulfil led for any text T = (SloS2o..S k) in L1, it would signifythat it was always possible to translate single sentences of thetext quite independently each of another.
It is probably not true.Sometimes, it is necessary to know, how the sentence S 1 was trans-lated, when we want to translate correctly the sentence ~,  becau-~ullk 4se regularly both sentences are connected as to the contents,and not always this connection is expressed by syntacticalmeans.
In addition, sometimes it is necessary to translatetoo long sentences from L I as two or more sentences fromand then not even the sequence is possible to be defined inadvance.In spite of this, the condition (2) or at least (3) is thebasic asumption for Any translation "sentence b~ sentence" andmost part of translation belongs to such a type of contemporarytranslations.
To be competent to accept the asumption (2) or(3) it sufficies to confine oneself to some texts only, and thetexts not fulfilling this assumption are necessary to be adaptedbefore the translation in order to make them able to fulfill it.It is not clear, of course, how to find it out at the given text,before starting the translation.
?he asumption (3) stands for nothing else than(4)and hence the substantial simplifying of the definition of trans-lation can to be seen.
It suffices, namely, to suppose that it isnecessary to define only a partial function F ~ of the functionF, that is defined for arbitrary sentences in L I only (on noaccount for arbitrary texts when the sentences are a specialcase of simple texts).
Thus, there holds F ~ (S) = F(S) for everysentence from L I and out of (2) there follows(5) sl.s2...s k) :IF'( s I ~.~(s 2).. .F~(s~ ~jv F(~ulfk 5so that in fact we are able to cope with the function F ~ when trans-lating the texts.Similarly, like at the function F, it is possible at thefunction ~ too, to try to give a trivial algorithm makingfull use of all pairs \[S,F~(S)~ o But the situation improvesonly a little.
It wold be again necessary to translate all thesentences in advance and even these are still too many, so thatall preceding reasons remain valid, what means, that it is necessar~to try to decompose even the sentences in parts, and to trans-late the sentences in parts, too?3o Translation "word by word"_?By the decomposition of the translation into sentencesthere were no difficulties because in printed texs this de-composition into sentences was just ready, and according tothe syntanctical means it was possible to decompose its parts@Of the same simplicity and uniqueness is the decompositionof the sentence S in its single words WI, W2,ooo,W k separatedby interspaces, so that it is possible to write S = (WIW2..oW k)like at the text.Besides, the linguists have constructed, a long time ago,a binary translative dictionary from the language L 1 into thelanguage L~o This dictionary is, in fact, defined as a set ofthe pair of words, the first-one from L 1 and the second-onefrom L 2 having the same meaningoif we denote by f the trans-lation from L 1 into ~,  where f is again generally many-valued~ulfk 6function (thanks to the homonymy of words) fthe condition (in details se-.
L 3 .i ~)evidently fulfilsW from L 1 .In whatever wmy the trivial algorithm of the translationof texts and sentences was funny and impossible, this algorithmis in case of the translation of words not only possible, butalso it is used from time to time by living translators.
At mostmachine translations, there is really choosen for the algorithmof the translation f the just mentioned trivial algorithm, i.e.into the memory of a computer there are input all pairs W, f(W)and the most tedious procedure is - how it was said- to look upin the memory and to compare.But it is not necessary to use this trivial algorithm?It is possible to construct a sequential automaton and thusto construct also a corresponding technical apparatus whichwill realize the function f, ioeo if there enters on its inputthe word W as a sequence of letters ll12.oolk, which is even-tually prolongated by the means of several help-symbols (compare\ [5  \] ) we get on output again the sequence of letters Ii12...i k Dthat eventually starts with several help-symbols and simultane-ously there holds thati W ~ when W = 1112 .lj j<k  (7) f(ll12o..l j) = i i i...Ik , .. , _ ?There is a question, whether there is not possible, when usingthis automaton, to shorten the time necessary for translating~when evidently all lost times can be excluded at looking up inthe input dictionaryo~ulfk 7Taking no account to the fact, in what way the translationof words f is given, one may ask, whether for the sentenceS = (WIW2...W k) there holds(s) z (s) = \[few l) f(w 2) f(W2)ooof(Wk> ,which is the similar condition to the condition (2) for thetranslation of texts.It is known that this condition holds nearly never formost natural languages, because the translation of words fis the translation of words in basic form only, whereas bythe decomposition of the sentence WI, W2,o.oW k are in va-rious word-formso To put it 8ifferently:the function f res-pects only the lexical meaning of words but does not takeinto consideration morphological questions?However even in the case~ the f1~nction f could be pro-longated from basic forms on other form of words-what, ofcourse, need not be possible-or on the contrary, if we adaptedto the basic form single words W i in the decomposition of thesentcnce~ yet despite this all - even under these suppositions- the condition 48)wou ld  be fulfilled in the case only, thatthere are concerned two languages L 1 and L 2 that are very stronglycognate, or two dialects of the same lamguagej or in the caseL 1 and L 2 are not cognate, the considered sentence S must bevery simpleoThe translation fulfill ing the condition analogous tothe condition (8) may be called the translation "word b3; word"?But unfortunately it is known that such a translation is im-~ulfk 8possible in natural languages, although it would be veryadvantageous and simple?It does not mean, of course, that the decomposition ofthe sentence into words cannot be used; it is too fine andtherefore it is necessary to decompose the sentence in anotherw~y, at all events in such a way that single parts will con-tain more than one word (and we suppose, under tacit consent,that the words have full meaning, not only being help-wor~swith the ~rammer meaning) and that these parts need not besentences?
Before introducing these parts~ it is necessaryto take into consideration various necessary morphologicaland grammatical statements, and thereby to adapt properlythe condition (8), too, wher~ there were no differences betweenthe basic word-form or the mere stem of the word and its va-rious possible forms?~ullk 94.
Syntactical and semantical characteristics of words.First of all we may suppose that, to avery word-form (shape)which appeared in the decomposition of some sentence into words, weare able to define its basic fo~n or stem W (the funct ion f'refers just to these basic forms) and its charaqteristic 'c = (x I, x 2, ... , xn), where n is according to the need asufficiently great integer and single x j are some gran~maticalmorphological and eventually even other data referring to the formW.
For example x I can be the datum on word-kind, x 2 the datumon case,time, x 7x 3 on gender,on mood a.s.o.x 4 on number, x 5 on person, x 6 onNaturally we also assume that on the contrary, if it isgiven the basic form w and prescribed (of course admissible) thecharacteristic c, it is  easy to define the starting form ~$.-\]Thus, we suppose that there are given functions h and h - suchthat h(W) = (w,c) andT guages (in L I and ~2h-!
(w,c) : W in each of considered fan-it wil l  be functions h I and h2).Although it is well known that the sentence and its trans-lation need not have the same nLnnber of words, this demand is notfar from truth when we pay attention only to the ful l-meaningwords.
Let us consider, however, such sentences S which fulfi lthis demand (this is the supposition for making the conm~ent easy)i.e.
if it is S = (W I W 2 ... W K) then(9 )  F#(W 1 W 2 .

= " ' "  WX ) ,~ullk I0Twhere evidently ~i are the words of the decomposition of the- - ~K sentence F~(S).
The task is, how to get the chain (W 1 W 2 ... )from the given chain (W 1 W 2 ... W E ) and we know already that itis not possible to get it by means of the translation word by wordaccording to (8) directly.When we use a functionits basic form: (wi, c i)and dataw i and characteristic ci, namely,and thus we can differentiate the data(c I, c 2, ..., cK).h I we get from any word-form W ih.(W. )
:J- l(W I, W 2,'.-, W K)It is similar with the translated sentencewhen one uses the functionh2 (~i) = (~i' ~i )"(w I w 2 ... w E)h 2.
Again we are able to discern data(~l' ~2' " '"  ~K ) when evidentlyNow, it is clear that instead of the condition (8) oughtto be the condition(I0) ~i = f(wi) for i = 1,2,..., kbecause here f is really used for basic for~s of words.
Thenthe translation fulfilling (i0) is in fact the translation ,,wordby word" but only in the respect of the meaning of word, beingfar from complete translation.
There is missing the proceeding,how to get from the starting characteristic (c!,  c2, ..., c K)characteristic (~i'  ~2' " '"  cK )" And just here there is impossible -except for the most simple example - to find such a function g ~norder to hold(!i) c i = g(ci) for i - 1,2,..., k.~ullk II.tlonit would evidently holdIf it were the case, or in tl~ese cases for which the func-g Could b~ found, the translation would be easy, because0 k,  g(c i) for i = 1,~,...,(13) G(C l, c2,..., c K) : cx)'as it was to be in (Ii),(c I, c2,..., c K)where, properly, would be necessary to differentiate functions- c K )  ~ ~ k .
G1, G2, GI< and put c i = G i (c l, c2,.,., o  i = 1,2,...Whereas the condition (lO) has been fulfilled quite frequently# ~especially at I simple sentences and above all when we weaken it byadmitting the changed the orderir~ of words W i in comparison withwords ~i ), i.e.
it is often possible to translate word by word asfor the mean i~s  of single ~ords, the condition (ll) has nearly neverbeen fulfilled.
It can be understood, because in the respect ofmeaning the languages do not differ as a matter of fact and thismatters in (lO), while morphologically and eventually even gran~ati-cally s id le  languages differ very s t ro~ly  and these facts mattersin (ll).so thatdependence on the sole characteristic c ibut in dependence on all characteristicsit may be written analogically to (9)where, of course, hl(W I) = (wi, c i) for i = 1,2,..., k.As it is impos~ibie to translate one characteristic afteranother, it is necessary to use instead of the supposed (but ingeneral not existing) function g, the more complicated functionG.
This function will not define single characteristics ~i in~ul/k 12From this also follows that difficulties of impossibil ityof the translation wo~'d by word accord i~ to (8) are - for thedifferentiation of the meaning=- and characteristic - due to thecharacteristic and not to the meahings.
This fact has a conside-rable heuristic import.
It is, ne~mel}', evident that the suitableparts into vJhich %re want to decompose the sentences are to be foundv~ith respect to their significance and not with respect to theirsyntactical or even morphological properties, in this case, namely,these parts wil l  be found at the same time in all languages evenif having been expressed in different lang~uages by different syn-tactical an morphological  means.
It is naturally self-evident thatbetween the significance of considered parts and their syntacticalexpressions are close connections (see \ [~ 3).Because of this, it is necessar3: to introduce, besides ~mentioned characteristics some others more, namely, logical andsemantical that wil l  be co~uuon for all !ang~uages and wil l  be ojaiteindependent of the syntax of la~uages .
And just this condition isfulfi l led by the logical and semantical  questions.Under the logical characteristics of v,~ords we understanddata on the fact ,~vhether and vzhat logical conjuctions or other logi-cal means (as quantors or negations) are by these vlords expressed.These facts are known from the logical analysis of sentences vJorked"% fh -v~ ?-out  by ~.
~a~p.By the ser~antical characteristics of ~,~ords ' ,re understand dataon the fact ~vhether the given word (v~c suppose v~,ord v,,ith full meaning,in no way gra~mmatical or logical v,,ords) plays the role of individualconstant, or variable i.e.
v,'hether it defines a certain otject~ullk ,,13(here the te~n object is used in the wide sense of the term) orce~ ~a~n propertied, or plays the role of an arbitrary-one with -one-placed predicat, i.e.
denotes some property, or of two-placedpredicat, i.e.
denotes two-member relation, or in general n-placedpredicat, i.e.
denotes n-figured relation.The situation is not so hopelessly complicated as it wouldseem at the first sight.
For instance, the individual constantseven the variables are only substantives while verbs are alwayspredicats one-.
two- three- even more placed, according to thesmaller or greater number of their objects.
Adjectives are alwaysone-placed predicate a.s.o.Besides the mentioned - and in the logic current - it isnecessary to consider as semantical characteristics data On timeand place and probably not yet c uite distinctly defined datareferring to the conditions under which the situation is beir~gdescribed (here belong some adverbial modifier).Thus, we suppose that We know the function k (analogouslylike h) which to any ~;ord-form W assigns its logical andsemantical character is t ic  d, thus, k(W) = d, while againd = (yl y2 X 1 , , , ..., y ) where e.g.
y is a datum, whether the2 word W is the logical functor and of what kind~ y is a datum3 wh~ther the word ~i is predicate and how many-placed, ya datum of what kind the predicate is, y4 whether there is in ~:lthe definition of time and of what kind,ac.~inl~zon of  p lace  and of  what type ,  yd ,~ i .

is possible and quite n~ura l  similarly as in the prec~c~te- logle -to take as important in a sentence such phrases (i.e.
their parts)that include always one word playing the role of n-placed predicate -so called basic oredicate - in this ~raso  (while phrases containn+l v~'ords) and the other words (just in the number  n) play therole of individual  constants or var.a~ies bei~g placed on singleplaces (positions) of the considered predicate.
In accordance withthe mentioned it referrs~ in this nhrase, to the denotat ion of then-membered re lat ion and to the de~o~_on of all n objects thatare mutual in this relation.
Thus, every such phrase is, in fact,a c~r~a..~ statement or a def in i t ion on the situation, as ~?
is theanalogy of the pr imit ive fo~u!a  in the mathemazica l  logic (e.g.o~uz~ when we Kno~v that P is P(a!, a2, a 3) is the pr imit ive f - '~ ?a three-f igured predicate, that Xl, x2, x 3 are indiv idual  constantsplaced on their  three places, and that the ment ione5 record sa~,s thatthe objects denoted by these constants are in re lat ion denoted bythe predicate P ) we ca 7~ such a phrase the pr imit ive ~h ~, 'S'~"7'-~_~aneou~!jo ,', -"~ ~s irz~~edmatel~," evident " ~ ~' ~n  ne primit ive J .b  - -phrase need not nave the grcmm~atica!

-~ ~ .o m of a gerodnd or a participle.
For  instance ,,a manreads a book" is the i~:rimitive phrase in the form of a j r~m~aticalsentence (here evid~,nt!y ,,reads" plays the role of two-f igured predi-cat~)~ but ~," ..u primit ive phrase ,,a man reading book" or ,,a man who~ullk 15is reading a book" has not the form of a sentence even if havingthe same meaning like'the preceeding phrase, because both expressthe same fact.
Some other types of primitive phrases are e.g.
these,,very good" wh~re ,,very" is a one-placed predicate and on the placeof it stands ,,good" (although in another primitive phrase ,,goodbook" is good itself a one-placed predicate), or ,,reads quickly",where a one-placed predicate is quickly a.s.o.From these examples there follows that primitive phrasescorrespond with primitive formulas in the predicate logic of higl~erorder.
In the phrase ,,man is mortal" there is evidently concealedthe universal quantor ,,every" so that this phrase has the samemean i~ like ,,every man is mortal" and thereby to not a primitivephrase but a composed-one.With regard to the syntactical side, the primitive phrasesdifferentiate on the basis of the characteristics of single words.For instance, the sequence of word-characteristics (el, c2, c$)where Cl, c2, c~ are such that c I denotes a substantive inthe first case, c 2 denotes a transitive verb, c I and c 2simultaneously coinciding in their components as for the genderand nur~ber, and at last c 3 signifies that it referrs to a substan-tive in the fourth case, when, in addition, the rar~e of characte-ristics sets the future word-order, is the characteristic of theprimitive phrase ,,a man reads a book" (when an indefinite articleis a considered not to be self-contained word\] and we assign ital~ays to the wol~ suceeding it i~m~ediately).
If we, namely, madefull use of the function h we would get h \ [a man\]  : \[ man, ci~i\] ,h \[reads\] = \[ read, cR\] and h \ [a book3 = \[ book, CB\] , and~ul/k 16simultaneousl7 it couls sure hold c~r~:~ = c l, c R = c 2 and c B = c 3 .The considered language is, besides its word-store put downin  the dictionary, characterized also by the list of all charac-teristics of primitive phrases.
That is what we shall suppose atany of the considered languages.If we use for the considered primitive phrases.
That iswhat we shall suppose at any of the considered languages.if we use for the considered primitive phrase ,,a nan readsa book" the function k, we get some semantical word-characteris-tics d~\[, dy~ and dB, and one of them will be especially distin-~ul~n~a as a basic predicate of the considered type of the orimitivephrase.
In our case it is d R and for i l lustration we s~all cometo an agreement that this basic predicate and other sem~nticalcharacteristics will be put down in the same way like it is done?
in the predicate logic, namely dR(d~,~, dB).
Let us call this entrythe semantical ch~racteristic of the considered phrase and alsothe semantical characteristic cor respond i~ with the syntacticalcharacteristic (c~ji, CR, c 5) of the considered phrase..~n~lo~ousagreements are to be made even with respect to other componentsof th~ semantical characteristic, particularly for the definit ionof time, place and other conditions.~;~t the same time, the semantical characteristic comprisesthese facts: d R a dat~n that it refe=rs to the two-figuredpredicate (eventually specialized by ~"  e  denotat~.on of some acti-vity), on the first place of which is just the word, with the seman-~ica!
characteristic d~ i (e.g.
~vith a shpplement ,,agens") and~ul!k 17he second place of w.~!ch corresponds with the semantical characte-oristic d B (eventually with supplement ,,patiens").
Simultaneously,the semantical characteristics may be eventually complementedwith further data, when it turns out to be suitable.
It is importantonly, that there are to be data (as it is mentioned in the paren-theses) that referr to the meanir~ and that are common for alllanguages.QBy the semantival characteristic dR(dN, d B) there is putdown, in the basic semantical categories, just what we want toexpress (By that time the basic forms Read, ~an, Book are fai!ir~;~ ?
these are possible to be chosen differently) whmle the corresponalngsyntactical characteristic (c~{, cR, c.)~ puts down how to expr@ssit.Now, the way is evident, how to translate primitive phrasesfrom the language L 1 into L 2.
There is important that ',~e supposethat whatever can be expressed in LI, can be expressed even inL 2 what is the basic supposition on the possibility of translating.From this there follows for the function of the translation oflwords f that for every basic form W from L there existsf(W) in L2, and that for ev.ery semantical characteristicdl(d2, d3, ..., d n) corresponding with the syntactical characte-r i s t i c (c i l '  ci2' " '" Cin ) in L I there exists the syntacticalcharacteristic, correspondil~ with it (Cjl , c j2 , ..., Cjn) inL 2 and just this-one (of course they may be several) will bedeclared to b~ the trabslation of the corresponding syntacticalcharacteristic from L I.
Thereby a further function ~ is defined~eventually a many-valued) for which there holds that~ul/k 18(!4) ~ (Cil, ci2 , ..., Cin)l : (Cjl, cj2 , ..., c. )2~n ~wh e (.

As for~ne meaning of single words~ this is guaranteed by the function ~and as for the meaning o?
the whole phrase, it is guaranteed by thefunction ~ , that luh l l - s  (14) that here in a special case playsthe role of the function G, because (!4) and (13) are identical.~ulfk 196.
Compound phrases.The composing of two or more primitive phrases in com-pound phrases can be performed by the usual logical means (e.g.by means of logical conjunctions "even" or "if,...theno.." even-tually of other analogous conjunctions like "but" and similar,or by mo~ns of negation and quantors) in a v~ll-known way, or c~nbe perfomed by the pure linguistic expressive means.
Both thesekind~ may be arbitrarily interchanged by the successive compo-sing.Similtaneously, it is decisive that the composing of singleprimitive phrases corresponds with the composing of their syn-tactical and, of course, semantical chsrac~eristicso Besides,there are mostly composed such two phrases that have some wordin common, or where some word is repeated.
This fact is necessa-ry to be distinguished especially by composing the correspondingrharacteristics, or - what is in substance the sam~- it is necesse-r~ ~ to join to ar~ word-characteristic c the symbol express~.ng a va-" l riable for the basic for.ms of word, so that we shall write X,c 1v,,here we can put for X the real basic forms of words.The composing of primitive phroses in compound phrasesbelong to the field of the synthesis of phrases?
If we, forinstance~ want to say that some man reads s book and simulta-neously that he reads quickly and~ in addition, that this bookis good ~nd even very good, we can express it in the followingcnmound phrases P = (which is zramm~tically the form of thesentence) "m~n reads quickly a very good book"?
The syntaxof this phrn~e is n~t evidently ewpress~d b$" the logical means?In the considered case the following primitive phrases areP1 "Po = " reads quickly", concerned: = " a ma reads a book,P~ = "good book" and P4 = "very good"o From these phrasesthe compound phrase is put togethcro If we use the functionh fcr single words of the considered phrase, we get successivelyh\[a man\]=~man, Cl\] , h\[quicklyl=Lquick, c2.7 , hEreads I =L-read, C3~o.. ', , , ,h\[a book\]=~book,, c J~where Cl, C2,ooo , 0 6 are the correapon-dine syntactical characteristics?
Analogously when we use the fun -ction k we get the semantical characteristics of single words?The syntactical characteristics of single (separate)primitive phrases PI' P2' P3' P4 are successively CI,C2,C3,C4,, , , , , , , L "3 ,  e3 ,  )C3 = (D?5,C 51 ~ ~W6, c6.
I) and C4 = ~:;4' c4.~ '\[WS' c5.~ )?
At thesame time, there is very important that some variables W i occursimultaneously in two primitive phrases?
Thereby is, namely,expressed the circumstance that by these two phraes is told so-mething of the same fact and just this circumstance plays thedecisive role at stating the constents-connection among more phrases?If we started from the given phrase " a man quic1~ly readsa very good book" we would find the mentioned four primitivephrases as follows: first we would use for single words the functi-on h and k and then we would find for every word of the mentionedphrase, which can be the basic predicate of some primitive phrase(it can be found out of its semnatical characteristics and by thesemantical characteristics of the primitive phraes) furtherwords belonging to it in a certain primitive phrase, ioeo whichtake places of the considered predicate and this occurs only~ulfk 21in comparison of the syntactical characteristics of wordsfrcm the given phrase with the syntactical characteristicsof a certain investigated primitive phrase?For instance, in our case~ if we have found out accordingto the semnatical characteristic that the word "reads" is two-placed predicate, we would find out the syntactical characteris-tics cf such primitive phraes, the basic word of which wasjust the two-placed predicate.
Then we have kncwn what syntac-tical characteristics of words and - as far as the word-orderis concerned - where there are to be found, so that we find outwhether the investigated primitive phrases are in the given phra-se included?
When finishing it for all these words, we shall findit successively for all primitive phrases that in the givenphrase are comprised?In such a way is, namely, depicted the analysis of thecompound phrase, not composed by the logical means.
If there areused the logical means, then the given phrase is decomposedlike in the logic?Rut it is necessary to mention in addition, that for theeconomy-reasons and for saving the number of syntactical charac-teristics of the primitive phrases, it is convenient to workoften with incomplete characteristics onlyo The questionis, whether we shall include two primitive phrases" a man readsa book" And "the man read a book" into one (incomplete)syntactical characteristic, or into two different and naturallycomplete -ones.
The incompleteness wi\]l consist in the failingfact on number (and si~ni\]arly it woula be in other phraes withdata on gender and case), but naturally there would not fail~ulik 22the datum on coincidence in number between ,,a man" and ,,readsor ,,the man" and ,,read" because this fact will  be ~.~st decisivefor the incomplete characteristics.The possibil ity of the use of incomplete syntactical cha-racteristics by the synthesis is, of course, also evident.
If wewant to make the whole synthesis of the compound phrase indepen-dent on proper meanings of single words, then we can givG in thesyntactical characteristics neither the gender nor the number,because both of them are defined differently no sooner than bythe choice of the basic form (because in many cases genders aresteadily fixed).
But even here it is not the matter of principlebut the matter of effectivity.7.

dependence and connectedness.As, sccording to the supposition, there is denoted inevery primitve phrase its basic predicate which always stands infront of parantheses in its semantical characteristic (for instan-ce at Q(x,y) Q is the basic predicate) it is possible to definethe semantical dependence among the words of the primitive phraseby the demand that the basic predicate a!v~ays depends on allother v;ords that occur in ti~e phrase, i.e.
on its arguments (e.g.Q deoends on x and on y) Just so Ous~ii-ed v~'ould be the defi-nition that, on the con~.~r$~?
7, ell argtm~ents depend on the basicpredicate.If we demonstrate this semantical dependence on a d io rama,_ =~.

At the same time,~ul~k 23of course, accord i~ to the position of separate words - ifthey are more to the left or to the right -we  discern alwaysthe word-order.
Four primitive phrases from the preceedingparagraph are deomstrated in the following diagramm:We say that the sem~tical  dependence is concerned because thisrelation ~o~ the basic predicate and its arguments, expressedjust by the theorem that objects denoted by the arguments arein relation defined by the basic predicate, is quite initialdefinition re fer r i~ evidently to the reality.
The semanticaldependence does not refer to a~th ing  else than to the fact ofte !
l i~  someth i~ of somethi~ (on the mathematical level thefact of te l l i~  ~l .~ ~ , )  can be transferred only on the basicrelation of the adherence to the set) when one passes from thepredicate Q to the binary relation Q~ and puts down(x,y)@Q~).We say further that in the primitive phrase the basic pre-dicate is directly connected with any of its arguments, i.e.
twowords of the primitive phrase cohere together when either thefirst depe~s on the second, or the second on the first.
~henillustrating the direct connectedness we can use the s~e diagrmr~like when i l !ustrat i~ the dependence, but we do not pay attentionto  arrow-heads.
Thus, evidently in  P "man" is directly connected~ulik 25by the referrin means (there are e.g.
pronouns, definite articlesand si~:~!ar), but sometimes these are concealed and in this caseit will be necessary to complete the text (or not to admit sucha text at all).
If there are everywhere the referring meansexpressed, they are possible to be used for further identificationof the v~ords of single diagran~Is for separate p~ras~s ~analogouslyas it was mentioned at the primitive phrases), and thereby to getthe  diagramms of the semantical dependence, eventually even thedependence for the whole text.In the case of the whoie-text-diagr&v~ two cases are possible:either there is a com~ected graph and then we say that the connec-ted text is concerned, or this graph is disconnected and then wesay that the text is disconnected.
But, any disconnected textsplits, in a natural way, into its connected components and itis evident that it will be possible to translate these componentsindependently on themselves (because they do not cohere togethersemantically).Therefore we can concern only a connected context T.According to the section 2 T = (SI.S 2.
...Sk), where S i aresentences and we remind that the condition (2) resp.
(5) isnot al!ways satisfied, because e.g.
sometimes it is necessaryto know 3 how the sentence S I was translated, when we want totranslate correctly the sentence $2~ But now it is simple to seethat there is exactely one word WI in S I and ~2 in S 2 such thatW I and W 2 are directly connected?
Therefore we may express a hy-pothesis that it is sufficient to store same informations con-oerning the single word W I instead of the whole translation of S I.~ulik 26In other words these informations concerning W I are thenecessary context, when we want to translate conectly $2oIt is similar in other cases?
