A FOR~ PROCEDURE FOR BULGARIAN WORD FORM GENERATIONElena PaskalevaSofia, BulgariaThe generation procedure proposed aims at the modell ingof the process of verbal and nominal inflexion in Bulgarian.As in most of the similar morphological models of inflexionallanguages the procedure uses a comparatively simple mechar~ismof description - a comparatively small number of initialobjects among which onl.y one relation (viz.
concatenation) isassigned; the transitions generating a separate concrete wordform (or class of word forms) are determined.The procedure includes the following l inguistic objects-"S = (s I, s2,..., s n )- a set of stems in Bulgarian(these can be the stems of dictionary entries in .a sufficient-ly full dictionary of Bulgarian or the stems of lexical itemsused by the native speaker in his language behaviour).K = (kl, k2, .., k~ - where k i i s a number of an in-flexional type.G = (g1' g2''''' gp) " where gi is grammatical meaning.P = < f1' f2" ' ' '  fg) " where fi is an ending.T = < tl, t2,... , tr) - where t i is the so called "theme",i.e.
one of the following elements: a thematic vowel in theverbal conjugation, a form-building suffix in the nominal de-clension or an extension of the stem in putting an article tosome masculine adjectives.A = < al, a2,... , a s) - where a i is a postpositionalarticle.- 217  -bD : (d I, ~ ,  ..., dw} - where d i is an inflexlonalsuffix.
(This deviation from the aim of the model to describeonly the processes of inflexlon is conditioned by the dualnature of the participle as a part of the verbal paradigmand at the same time following the adjectival declension.This is the reason why, as we shall see below, it is generat-ed in two phases: "verbal stem-~ stem of a particlple" and"stem of a participle ~ word form of a participle".
In thefirst phase elements participate belonging %o the verbal in-flexion (the thematic vowel typical for the inflexional typeof the verbal stem), and in the second, elements belongingto the adjectival declension.The elements of S csm be mapped onto K. This map ismany-one.
The element correspondlng to s is denoted by k s-Between the elements of G and F, G and T, G and D, Gand A correspondences exist which must be assigned in atable because of special language reasons - the ambiguity ofthe morphological elements and the different inflexion of onegrammatical category.For an initial symbol (S) of the generation procedure,some s i is accepted accompanied by the corresponding ksl andthe set G s c G. By the concatenation of s with t, d, a andf (the sequence of operations can be followed on the transit-ion network) the followin 6 linguistic objects are obtained:a. as intermediate states of the generation procedure:ST - extended stem, i.e.
"stem + theme" (s i t~)~SD - derlvatlonal stem, i.e.
"stem (+eventually atheme) + word forming suffix" (s i t~ d m ors I ~).b.
