Box  121000-901 Warszawa,  POLANDABBT~CTWe single out a class of prototypes i.e.,a class of constructions forcing the obligatorycoreference or obligatory noncoreference.
Anessential feature of prototypes is theirundistinctiveness.
In this sense  they are themost natural and  efficient mearis ofcommunicat ion  in discourse.The  non-application of prototype should bewell motivated.
This  leads to the rule ofres t r i c ted  cho ice  s ta t ing  that  whenever  it isposs ib le  the  app l i ca t ion  of a p ro to type  shou ldbe  pre fer red .The  ru le  of the  res t r i c ted  cho ice  suggeststhe  genera l  out l ine  of in terpret ing  ambiguoussentences ,  s t r i c t ly  speak ing ,  the  method  ofo rder ing  admiss ib le  in terpreta t ions :  those  wh ichcan  be  equ iva lent ly  expressed  by  means  ofa p ro to type  are  less  probab le .
In o ther  words ,the  ru le  of  the  res t r i c ted  cho ice  can  beregarded  as  some k ind  of  mechan ism order ingthe  hypotheses  fo r  computer /on .INTRODUCTIONThe  crucial prob lem in d iscourse analysisis the appropriate transposition of allexpress ions  occurr ing in it, into reality (see,for instance, the f ramework  provided by Kempin (Kamp,  1981)).
Even  pre l iminary  analysisshows  that one  real object can  be identifiedby var ious surface constructions.
Th is  forcesthe necessity of dividing surface express ionsinto c lasses denoting ident ical  individuals.The  above  prob lem can  formally be statedas follows.
To  each  d iscourse D we assignsome reality wh ich  can  be understood asa set ID of individuals (semantic d iscoursedomain) together with a set of relat ionsdefined on ID.
The semantic d iscourse domaincan be interpreted twofold:1.o as a set of real  objects i.e., objectsexist ing in actual wor ld;2 ?
as a set of mental objects i.e., objectsexisting in language user ' s  mind.Al though the  f i r s t  in terpreta t ion  is  morenatura l ,  it l eads  to some onto log ica l  p rob lems,concern ing  the  d i s t inc t ion  of f i c t i t ious  andnon- f i c t i t ious  ent i t ies .
S ince  there  is  no  suchd i s t inc t ion  f rom l ingu is t i c  perspect ive  thesecond in terpreta t ion  seems bet ter  mot ivated ."
/he  next  s tep  is  to de f ine  syntact i cd i scourse  domain ,  denoted  by  S_ ,  i .e.
,  a se tL) of d i scourse  express ions  re fer r ing  toind iv idua ls  ( se t  of ind iv idua ls ) .
The  mapp ingass ign ing  ind iv idua ls  to syntact i c  express ionsw i l l  be  ca / led  the  re ference  funct ion  anddenoted  by  R. F 'o rma/ ly ,  R : S D 2 ID.Example(D I )  John and  Peter admire winter.
Theyare  o f ten  sk i ing  together .SDI" - {"John", "Peter", "winter", "they ''~ID 1 - ~John, Peter, winter~( " John" )  - {John}R ("Peter") - {PeterlR ( " they" )  ,, {John, Peter\]"R ( "w inter" )  - {winter}We say  that d iscourse  express ions  x andy a.re coreferencial, what  we  denote by  xCy,if and  only if they refer to the same set ofindividuals.Formally,for each  x,y ~ S u xCy  iff R(x)= R(y)It is readily verified that C is anequivalence relation.
Obv ious ly  eachequivalence class of C contains coreferentia/expressions.
The  set of equivalence c lassesof C will be  ca/led the reference sta~te ofd iscourse and  denoted by  RSD.Example(D2)  John took a knife.
( RSD 2 ) " "~ knife '~-.
John 5~ ~"a(D3)  John took a knife.
He  hurt himself.
(RSD3)  ~"JOhn:', "he",  "himself'.~knife"}.We can  observe  here that adding newutterance to the discour.~;e changes  its93reference state.
In this sense  RSD is adynamic  notion Let us note also that theprob lem of anaphora  solution can  be regardedas defining the relation C for  the who lediscourse.Both the speaker,  while constructin~a discourse, and the hearer, while eunalysingit, try to achieve the identity of RSD at  eachstep of the discourse.
We argue in thispaper that to accomplish this effect, thespeaker has at his disposal (at each moment)a more restricted set of l inguisticconstructions than it seems intuitively.
Letus notice that express ions  belonging to oneequivalence class have  var ious syntacticshapes  at different steps of discourse.
It ca/'*be shown that the syntactic form ofexpress ions  at particular moments  is notaccidential, i.e., e lements of indicatedequivalence class are not interchangeable.P R O'I'O'I'YP E SRecent  d iscourse  theories provide severallevels of larlguage analysis: morphological,syntactic, semantic and  somet imes  pragmatic.Each  of these levels determines acharacteristic set of notions and  mechan isms.It is assumed here that the analysis of 82",utterance on each  levels of language shouldyield complete information obtainable by  toolsavailable on this levelClassical anaphor  resolvers act onsemantic level on d iscourse  analysis.
~Are takethe position that for inflexion al l anguages  thecoreference relation can  be partially descr ibedon the syntactic level An  essential feature ofthis par t ia l  characteristic is defining thecoreference relation quite apart from Pealindividuals, i.e.
without specyfing the referencefunct ion .
"Po fix some ideas let us cons ider  anutterance containing the noun phrases  NP l ,..., NP .
If there  i s  no  in fo rmat ion  regard ing  n core ference ,  a l l  we  can  do  i s  to  asser t  thatthe  core ference  re la t ion  i s  inc luded betweenthe  "min imal "  re la t ion ,  i .e .

A lmost  a /ways  we can  ass ign toan utterance a syntactic level informationstating obligatory- coreference or obliqatorynoncore ference  of some expressions.The  surface constructions carrying thiskind of information with respect to p ronounsand  zero pronouns  (in the case  of elidedsubject) will be called prototypes.
Ln otherwords  proto types  can  be regarded  assyntactic means  forcing obligatory coreferenceor obligatory noncore ference  between pronounsor zero pronouns  and  other surfaceexpressions.Let us cons ider  few instances ofprototypes.

Usiad~ do stc~u, a .Tan naleuI: mu wina.Sat  at the tab le ,  und John pouredhim out  some wine .The  above  examples  pose  the quest ion  ofhow the c lass  of p ro to types  shou ld  be s ing ledout.
Th is  p rob lem can  be  so lved  byspec i fy ing  a co l lec t ion  of ru les  concern ingthe ob l igatory  core ference  and  ob l igatorynoncore ference .
The  exact  format  of theseru les  is  beyond the scope  of th is  paper .For  in f lex iona l  languages  they  depend on thetype  of cons idered  sentence ,  the sentence-- leve l  funct ions  of cons idered  phrasesand  the i r  syntact i c  shape .
As  a s impleexample  of such  a ru le  let us  cons ider  thebas ic  c r i te r ion  of exc lud ing  core ference :If the ob jec t  is  expressed  by  means  ofa re f lex ive  pronoum,  then it is  core ferent ia lw i th  the sub jec t ;  in o ther  cases  there fe rent ia l  ident i l y  of the sub jec t  and  ob jec tis excluded.Th is  criterion can  be  applied both fordeterrninig coreferents of objects - blockingthe subject, and  in tesf/n~ the possibleantecedents  of the subject - blocking theobjects.
Th is  is exactly the case  we have  in(5 ) .THE RULE OF' RESTRICTED CHOICEA conclus ive criterion of being a prototyperesults from analysing a given sentence  it%isolation.
If it is possible to assert or toexc lude the referential identity of someexpress ions  of the sentence, indepedent ly ofits context then  the sentence  can  be  regardedas  an instance of prototype.
An  essentialfeature  of p ro to types  is that they  arecomplete ly  ind is t inc t ive  and  in th is  sense  theyare  the most p roper  too l  fo r  express inga cer ta in  re la t ionsh ip  in the u t te rance .
Th iss t rong  re la t ionsh ip  makes  it poss ib le  toe l iminate  some in terpreta t ions ,  wh ich  in o thercases  shou ld  be regarded  as  probab le  too.If we agree  that ach iev ing  unambigu i ty  ofd i scourse  is  the major  goa l  both  for  thespeaker  and  the hearer ,  then  the non--app l i ca t ion  of prototype, as  the most  naturaland  efficient mea/qs of communicat ion  shouldbe well motivated.
When such  a special reasonis lacking, the speaker  should  apply aa prototype.
Under  this assumpt ion  the set oflinguistic tools available to the speaker  isrestricted.The  notion of prototype can  be  natural/yapplied on the syntactic level of d iscourseanadysis to limit the number  of hypotheses  forfurther consideration.
13ut it can  also be usefulon the hi~her levels to interpret ambiguousdiscourses.
Strictly speak in~ the propertiesof prototype suggest  the genera l  outline ofi n te rpret ing  ambiguous  sentences ,  moreprec i se ly  a method of o rder in~ poss ib lein terpreta t ions  w i th  respect  to the i r  p laus ib i l i ty .F rom the set  of poss ib le  in terpreta t ions  ofa sentence ,  those  that  can  be  equ iva lent lyexpressed  by  means  of p ro to type ,  shou ld  beregarded  as  less plausible.
The  justificationof this cho ice  is clear: if the speaker  wantedto point out such  an  interpretation, he wou ldnaturally ach ieve  it by  applying a prototype.In v iew of the obove  we can  formulatethe rule of restricted choice.
It states thatwhenever  it is possible the application ofa proto type  shou ld  be pre fer red .It i s  i r rpor tant  to not i ce  that  the ru le  ofres t r i c ted  cho ice  can  be v iewed from theperspect ive  both  of the speaker  cont ruct ingthe d i scourse  and  the hearer  mode l l ing  it.The  speaker  should apply  prototypeswhenever  it is possible.
The  hearer  shouldtake this fact into consideration.Let us try to interpret the concretesentences with the help of the rule ofrestricted choice.
(8) Zanim ~)I wyszed~, .Tan zgasi~ ~wiat{o.Before ~I  leftmasc, .Tohn tumedmascthe light off.There  are two interpretations here:(9) Zanim zgasi   wia oBefore ~ I  left, J ohn  turned the light off.l(1.0) Zan im ~I  w3zszed2, Jan zgasi{ ~wiat~o.Before ~ll left, John turned the light off.
(~ denotes  the reference to the context).But  the first interpretation can  be  expressedby  means  of prototypes.
(P l )  Zan im ~I  ~Aryszed{, @2 zgasit ~wiat~o.Before ~1 left, ~2 turned the Light off.
(P2)  Jan zan im wyszedt ,  ~1 zgasit gwiatto.John before left, ~1  turned the light off.Accord ing  to the rule of restricted choicethe first interpretation should  be  regarded  asless probable  (note that it can  be  expressedby  prototype).
Hence  the second interpretationshould be  chosen.9SAnother  example  i s  more  complicated.
(11)  Zan im o__.nn wyszed~,  ~I  zapy~ak ~eo,czy  #2 p6jdzie do kina.Before he leftmasc , @I, had  asked  him,whether  ~2 wou ld  have  gone  to thecinema.In the embedded c lause03.
zapy%a~ gOthere acts the rule of obligatory noncore ferenceexcluding the referentia/ identily of subject andob ject  in this sentence:Zan im on wyszed~,  @~zapytak j~o,czy  ~2 p6jdzie do kina.Accord ing  to our  definition the above  sentenceis an instance of a prototype.Exc luding the coreference of pointedexpress ions  decreases  the numer  of possibleinterpretations, but does  not clear up allreferential relationships in this ambiguoussentence.
A l though there are no furthersyntactic p remises  to resolve this ambiguitywe  can  specify the less probable interpretationby appying the rule of restricted choice.
If thespeaker  wanted  to express  the fo l low ingsense:(12) Zan im X wyszeck%, X zapy%a.% go,czy  @1. p6jdzie do kineu .he should have  used  the following (structural)prototype:(13) Z~im ?
~ 1  ~apyt~ go,czy  ~2 p6 jdz ie  do  k ina .
( In  such  a sequence  of c lauses  in thesentence the rule of ob l igatory  coreferencedemandes  that ?
and  @1. shou/d be identified).It follows there fore  that the interpretation:(3.4) Zan im on wyszedku .~ l  zap vta~ go,czy  ~2 p6jdzie do kina.is the less probable and  should be computedas the last one.NONMONOTONIC ITY  OF  THE RULE05 '  lqESTRICTED CHOICECons ider  the following example:(15) I<iedy @I podszed~ do Piotra,by~ on zdenerwowany.When ?
I  came near  Peter,he was  nervous.There  are two possible interpretations(3.6) K iedy  ?
I  podszed{ do Piofra, by~ onzden  erwowany.
( 1,7 ) K iedy  ~p.odszed~ do P io t ra ,  by~A, onzden  erwowany.2ecause  the second interpretation canunambiguous ly  be expressed  by  the prototypicalc on struction:(3.8) K iedy  ~I podszed{ do Piotra, by~ ~)2zden  er%vowalny.When ~)I came near  Peter Q2 wasnervous.accord ing to the rule of restricted cho ice thefirst interpretaf/on should be preferred.The  rule of resfx'icted cho ice is based  onthe assumpt /on  that whenever  it is possiblepeople  use  unambiguous  constructions.A l though usually va/id this assumpt ion  cannotbe regarded  as  genera@ truth.
Th is  meeuns thatthe rule of restricted cho ice enab les  one tojump to plausible but not ironclad conclusions.
"l~pically, such  conc lus ions  can  be invalidatedwhen new information i s  available.
In ourexample  the preferred intezq0retation might heoverturned when we extend our d iscourse  asfollows:(1.9) I<iedy ~I  podszed~ do Piotra,by~ on zdener-vvowany.BM~ tc wyn ik  wcze~nie jsze j  k~6tniz Piotrem.
?I  came near  Peter  he was  Whennervous.That  was the result of an earlierquarrel with Peter.96The neoess i ty  of chang ing  the  pre fer redinterpretation follcws from the fact that newinformation is available.
The  property ofdrawing plausible but defeasible inferencescharacterizes non-monoton ic  reasoning.Various forms of this kind of reasoning arenow being deve loped  (see (~AI -84) ) .It is now widely recogn ized  that d iscourseunders tand ing  regu l res  nonmonoton icmechan isms in many aspects .
The  ru le  ofres t r i c ted  cho ice  is  an  example  of sucha nonmonoton ic  too lC ONCLUSIONS(1.)
Wh i le  const ruct ing  d i scourse  thespeaker  wants  the  hearer  to unders tand  himcorrectly.
Even  if he  uses  ambiguousconstructions he intends to cemrr, unicate theunique interpretations, and  not to create inheater 's  mind a set of a/l possible hypotheses.It follows that constructhag NLU systems, wh ich~enerate all admissible interpretations,contradicts common sense  reasonln~.
So  theessential prob lem is to determine methods  o/choos ing  the most  appropriate interpretation.If this plausible interpretation fails, i t  shouldbe revised.
(2) Employ ing  the rule of  restricted cho iceassumes  the existence of some mechan ismwh ich  determines whether  a given constructioncan  be regarded  as a prototype.
'l~bis can  beach ieved  by  specifyins a set of rules quali~j'ingthe obUgatory  coreference and  noncore ferenceof referrins expressions.
