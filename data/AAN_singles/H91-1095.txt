New York University Proteus Project:ROBUST AND PORTABLE TEXT PROCESSINGRalph Grishman, Principal InvestigatorDepartment of Computer ScienceNew York UniversityNew York, NY 10003PROJECT GOALSOur primary goal is the development of robust andportable systems for processing natural anguagetext, particularly for the purposes of extractinginformation or retrieving passages or documentsfrom a text collection.
A major focus has been onautomatically or semi-antomatically acquiring thesyntactic and semantic characteristics of newdomains from samples of text.RECENT WORKOver the last few months we have begun to adaptour Proteus information extraction system to pro-cess reports of terrorist activity.
This is being doneas part of MUC (Message Understanding Confer-ence) -3, a comparative evaluation of informationextraction systems organized by the Naval OceanSystems Center.
These reports are substantiallymore complex, both syntactically and semanti-cally, than the Navy operational reports we previ-ously processed.
Considerable effort has thereforegone into extending our grammatical coverage andimproving the efficiency and accuracy of ourparser; we have experimented with several tech-niques, including closest attachment heuristics,merging of alternative analyses of constituents,statistically-lrained stochastic grammars, and sto-chastic part-of-speech tagging prior to parsing (thelast done in collaboration with BBN Systems andTechnologies Corp.).We have also begun to investigate the benefits ofnatural language processing for documentretrieval.
We have developed a fast and robustTagged Text Parser, which uses text stochasticallytagged by part-of-speech (again with the assistanceof BBN), and generates full syntactic analyses(,possibly skipping some unanalyzable consti-tuents).
These parses are then used to identify co-occurrence patterns and compute similaritycoefficients between words.
This work, by Strzal-kowski and Vauthey, is reported in a separatepaper in these proceedings.Finally, as part of our research on sublanguage-based machine translation, we are continuingdevelopment of our Japanese grammar.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAROur primary task for the remainder of MUC-3(through May 1991) will be to incorporate addi-tional semantic information about the terroristdomain.
We intend to do this, as much as possible,through semi-automatic techniques driven by theparsed corpus of 1300 reports.
Following comple-tion of the formal evaluation i  May, we expect ospend considerable time evaluating the contribu-tions of various ystem features to our overall per-formance.For document retrieval, we intend to utilize a clus-tering procedure which, based on the similaritycoefficients we have generated, will form domain-specific word classes.
We will then investigate hebenefits of using these word classes as a thesaurusfor keyword-based document retrieval, using astandard ocument test collection.Finally, we expect over the coming year to bringtogether our pilot study of sublanguage-basedmachine translation, our work on reversible gram-mars, and our Japanese and English grammars tocreate a reversible Japanese-English translationsystem, albeit initially operating on a very limiteddomain and vocabulary.421
