The controlled vocabulary isintended to support editors in assigning de-scriptors to new documents and to supportusers in retrieving documents of interest re-gardless of the spelling or language varietyused in the documents.1 IntroductionUntil quite recently, most critical edition1 projectsproduced printed books, even though the produc-tion of these volumes has been supported by com-puters since the 1960s, e.g., for concordancing,collation, and statistical analyses, as well as forbibliography management, text editing, and type-setting (see, e.g., Froger (1970)).Modern edition projects increasingly aim to pro-duce digital editions that offer linking, dynamicdisplay of alternative readings, or the integrationof related images (in particular facsimiles of origi-nal documents), audio, or video.
However, the newtarget medium does not just offer new possibili-ties, but it also demands sometimes fundamentalchanges in the editorial process.One affected area is indexing.
In printed books,the manually constructed back-of-the-book indexis the only way for readers to access the contentsin a non-linear fashion.
A good index is not merelya list of words occurring in the text, but it specifies1In a narrow sense, a critical edition is a scholarly editionthat tries to recover the most authentic version of a historicaltext from extant sources.
We use the term loosely to includeother types of scholarly editions, in particular diplomaticeditions.concepts and introduces synonyms and, throughcross-references, related terms.
The possibility toperform full-text searches on digital texts thereforedoes not render manually constructed indices ob-solete, but complements them (see Savoy (2005)for an evaluation in a comparable scenario).
Foreditions of historical texts, a manually constructedindex is indispensable, as spelling variation, mean-ing shifts, and multilingualism make full-text re-trieval difficult for both laypersons and experts.In book form, collective editions of shorter texts,such as letters, treaties, or charters, form one mono-lithic entity.
The electronic medium allows fordirect linking and repurposing of individual parts(or content objects) of a collection in new con-texts, so the individual edited text is much moreindependent than it was in a printed volume.
Thishas direct implications for the construction of in-dices: Traditionally, an index for a book is com-piled when it is completed; thus, when selectingkeywords, the indexer does not consider individualtexts in isolation, but rather within the specific con-text set by the book.
An indexer may thus chooseone particular term for describing a concept overanother one because it occurs verbatim in the ma-jority of texts; or an indexer may choose to leaveout certain possible index terms because they areself-evident in the context of the book, e.g., theindex to an edition of letters is unlikely to containthe index term letter.In a digital edition, in contrast, index termsshould be rather thought of as metadata assignedto individual content objects to enable retrieval andreuse in different contexts.
For example, if an edi-tion of a letter is included in a thematic collectioncontaining various types of documents, it shouldhave the metadata information letter, as this maybe a distinguishing feature in this collection.
Italso means that a collection may contain items24annotated by different editors, in contrast to back-of-the-book indices, which are typically created bya single indexer.In order to ensure interoperability of indexterms, a controlled vocabulary should be used.
Wedefine a controlled vocabulary in accordance withANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 (ANSI/NISO, 2005) asa set of canonical terms that are managed by anauthority according to certain rules; for multipleterms referring to the same concept, a preferredterm (i.e., descriptor) is defined, and a term rep-resenting various concepts is made unambiguous.A controlled vocabulary may have defined typesof relationships between terms such as in a tax-onomy (hierarchy), thesaurus (hierarchy, equiva-lence, association), or ontology (specific types ofrelationships like ?is produced by?
).Construction of controlled vocabularies isa time-consuming and labor-intensive process.Since it requires deep semantic understanding, itcannot be fully automated.
However, we notedin our experiments that some stages of buildinga controlled vocabulary (see Shearer (2004) for anine-step procedure to build a thesaurus) can bepartially automated.
In particular, we propose toharvest the information contained in subject in-dices from earlier or related works.This paper describes ongoing work along theselines towards a controlled vocabulary for the Col-lection of Swiss Law Sources, a large-scale criticaledition of historical texts.
The vocabulary is in-tended to support editors in finding meaningful andagreed-upon descriptors and to facilitate retrievalof documents by both experts and laypersons.
Weexpect that for our purposes a post-coordinate vo-cabulary2 will be most useful, but the exact typeand structure of the vocabulary will be defined ata later stage.The main contributions of this paper are (1) toraise awareness for existing manually created in-formation resources, which are potentially valu-able for many tasks related to the processing ofhistorical texts, and (2) to describe exploratorywork towards using one type of resource, namelyindices, for creating a controlled vocabulary.The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 dis-cusses related work; Section 3 gives an overviewof the Collection and its subject indices; Section 4describes the extraction of index terms and their2See ANSI/NISO (2005) for a definition of postcoordina-tion.conflation using base form reduction; Section 5describes experiments with decompounding; inSection 6 we compare the extracted terms with theheadwords of the HRG; Section 7 summarizes ourfindings and outlines future work.2 Related WorkVocabularies are inherently domain-specific.
Forour domain of historical legal texts, there is cur-rently no controlled vocabulary that could be usedas a basis.
Despite some similarities, modern legalvocabularies such as Jurivoc3 or the GLIN Sub-ject Term Index4 are not readily applicable to me-dieval and early modern jurisdictions (e.g., theylack concepts such as feudal tenure or witchcraft).The Vocabulaire international de la diplomatique(Milagros C?rcel Ort?, 1997) is an attempt at avocabulary for describing types of historical docu-ments, but it is not fine-grained enough and doesnot consider historical regional differences.There are various approaches for automaticallygenerating back-of-the-book indices and thus po-tential descriptors (e.g., Csomai and Mihalcea(2008)), but these are intended for book-lengthtexts in a single language; in the case of historicaleditions, however, the documents differ widely inlength, language, and age.Romanello et al (2009) have parsed OCR-processed indices scriptorum and extracted infor-mation to support the creation of a collection offragmentary texts.
Even though this is a com-pletely different task, the approach is somewhatrelated to ours, in that it aims to utilize the valuableinformation contained in manually created indices.3 The Collection of Swiss Law SourcesThe Collection of Swiss Law Sources is an editionof historical legal texts created on Swiss territoryfrom the early Middle Ages up to 1798.
The Col-lection includes acts, decrees, and ordinances, butalso indentures, administrative documents, courttranscripts, and other types of documents.
Since1894, the Law Sources Foundation has edited andpublished more than 60,000 pages of source mate-rial and commentary in over 100 volumes.The primary users of the Collection are histo-rians, but it is also an important source for theSwiss-German Dictionary, which documents the3http://bger.ch/jurisdiction-jurivoc-home4http://glin.gov/25German language in Switzerland from the late Mid-dle Ages to the 21st century.
See Gschwend (2008)for a more detailed description of the Collection.The primary sources are manuscripts in variousregional historical forms of German, French, Ital-ian, Rhaeto-Romanic, and Latin, which are tran-scribed, annotated, and commented by the editors.The critical apparatuses are in modern German,French, or Italian.
Each volume contains an indexof persons and places and a subject index.
At thetime of this writing, the Collection covers 17 ofthe 26 Swiss cantons to different extents.The Collection is an ongoing project; futureadditions to the Collection will be created as digitaleditions.
Instead of compiling a book, each sourceconsidered for addition to the Collection will bestored in a TEI-encoded XML document; virtualvolumes, e.g., on a certain topic, place, or period,can then be created by selecting a subset of thesedocuments.
To make this possible, each documentneeds to contain the necessary metadata.
Some ofthe metadata has traditionally been associated witheach source text: A modern-language summary,the date, and the place of creation.
In addition,each document will need to be assigned a set ofdescriptors.The basis for the work described in this paperare the 22 latest volumes of the Collection, forwhich digital typesetting data is available; this sub-set is referred to as DS21 (H?fler and Piotrowski,2011).
We have converted the typesetting files ofthe indices into an XML format that makes the logi-cal structure of the indices explicit, i.e., headwords,glosses, spelling variants, page and line references,etc.
The conversion process is described in detailby Piotrowski (2010).DS21 contains volumes from ten cantons repre-senting most linguistic and geographic regions ofSwitzerland and spans 1078 years.
We thereforebelieve DS21 to be a good sample of the typesof documents contained in the Collection, and wetherefore expect high-frequency index terms tobe good candidates for inclusion in the controlledvocabulary.
The subject indices of the DS21 vol-umes contain a total of 70,531 entries (plus 43,264entries in the indices of persons and places).
Inthe work described below we have focused on theGerman-language volumes; the volumes in Frenchand Italian will be considered at a later stage.
Thesubject indices of the German-language volumescomprise a total of 47,469 entries.1100 wein-aufseher ?

Since the subjectindices also serve as glossaries, a particular featureis that they contain both historical and modernheadwords; words in italics are modern terms, allother are historical words.4 Extracting and Conflating IndexTermsDue to high variability of the historical index termswe decided to first concentrate on the modern indexterms.
Since different historians have worked onthe subject indices, our first question was whetherthe extracted terms would overlap at all, and, ifthey do, to what extent and in which areas.
In to-tal, 6370 subject index word forms were extractedusing a Perl script from the 16 German-languagevolumes.
In a first step towards merging the ex-tracted keywords, we manually removed irrelevantterms from the list of unique keywords (e.g., histor-ical terms mistagged as modern terms), resulting in5138 terms.
We normalized the remaining entriesby removing punctuation and grammatical infor-mation given with some entries.
About 85% of26the unique terms occur only once.
Thus, the vastmajority of terms are associated with a specificvolume.Of the 15% of keywords that occur more thanonce the most frequent one is Erbrecht ?inheritancelaw?
with 10 appearances.
Although specific le-gal terms like Erbrecht are, as would be expected,relatively frequent, a similar number of keywordsis linked to people?s social, religious, and profes-sional roles (reflected in terms like vagrant, baptist,pope, baker, tanner, etc.)
together with terminol-ogy related to trades (for example livestock trade,animal market, sawmill).
This indicates that a con-trolled vocabulary for the Collection should notonly take into account legal terminology but alsofocus on roles and trades, which could potentiallybe covered by a separate controlled vocabularyfacet (for a list of potential law subject facets seealso Broughton (2010, p. 38)).We were surprised by the small intersection be-tween the volumes?
subject indices.
Looking forways to further conflate the terms, we noted a num-ber of mismatches due to morphological variation(such as singular and plural forms), even thoughsubject indices are not as inflectionally rich as nor-mal German text.Since many index terms are highly domain-specific or specific to Swiss German (e.g., com-pounds of the term Anke ?butter?
like Ankenballenor Ankenhaus), we did not use a rule-based mor-phological analyzer (such as GERTWOL, StripyZebra, or Morphisto; for an overview see Mahlowand Piotrowski (2009)) but the Baseforms toolfrom the ASV Toolbox (Biemann et al, 2008),which is based on pretree classifiers.
The Base-forms tool does not perform morphological analy-sis, but is more akin to a stemmer, so that its outputis not necessarily linguistically correct; however,since we are primarily interested in term conflation,this is not a major problem.
When the output of thesystem was empty or malformed we used the origi-nal term to ensure maximum overlap.
We manuallyreviewed and, where necessary, corrected the baseforms, also to get a better understanding of thekind of potential conflations.
This cut down thelist of keywords from 5138 to 4881 terms, i.e., 490terms were morphological variants that could beconflated to 233 ?concepts.
?The majority of term conflations concern varia-tion in number (Kapelle ?chapel?

), and variant compound forms(Lehenherr and Lehensherr ?liege?
).5 Experiments with CompoundsGerman is well-known for its tendency to formcompound nouns to express complex concepts.
Forvocabulary construction, compounds are interest-ing because related terms often share constituentparts.
Our idea was therefore to use decompound-ing to identify potential related terms.
The relation-ships between these terms are usually weaker thanbetween equivalent terms (like plural and singularvariants), but will still be valuable in building acontrolled vocabulary.
For the following experi-ments we used the decompounding as produced bythe ASV Baseforms tool with manual corrections.In a first experiment, we extracted groups ofcompound-word terms that share the same firstelement.
This gives us, for example, Bau ?con-struction?, Bauarbeiter ?construction worker?, andBauherr ?constructor?.
The terms found in thisway could, for example, be used to build a map onthe topic ?construction?
as shown in Figure 3.
Intotal, we found 2555 matches by first compoundelements.
Note that partial matching without com-27pound splitting would lead to unwanted hits likeBauer ?farmer?
and Baumgarten ?tree garden?.In a second experiment, we identified terms shar-ing the same last compound element.
Overall thisresulted in 2477 matches.
Due to the structure ofGerman compounds, terms sharing the final com-pound element are usually more closely relatedthan those sharing the first element.
Examplesalong the lines of Bau ?construction?
are Hausbau?house construction?
and Kirchenbau ?church con-struction?
; see Figure 4.
Although not all of thematches will be equally relevant (for example Erb-fall ?case of succession?
and Wasserfall ?waterfall?are not semantically related), matches tend to pointto terms on the same hierarchical level, meaningthat the base form consisting of one element only(if it exists) acts as the broader term (Bau) of thecompound matches which are the narrower terms(Hausbau and Kirchenbau).At the moment our approach does not takeinto account homonyms and polysemes5 such asGericht ?court?
vs. Gericht ?dish?
or Kirche ?churchas a building?
vs. Kirche ?church as an institution?.Such semantic unknowns would need to be ana-lyzed in the context of the text passages that theback-of-the-book subject indices refer to.
Such asemantic review will be conducted at a later stagewhen the terms are prepared to be grouped in acontrolled vocabulary.6 Comparison to HRG HeadwordsAs noted in Section 4, the majority of index termsoccur only once, i.e., in a single volume.
In or-der to answer the question of how many of ourterms are just locally useful and how many maybe of more general utility, we compared our list tothe list of headwords of the Handw?rterbuch zurdeutschen Rechtsgeschichte (HRG) (Cordes et al,2008 ), the standard reference work on Germanhistory of law.
The rationale is that the intersec-tion of both lists contains those index terms thatare highly likely to be useful as descriptors in acontrolled vocabulary.The comparison of the 3395 headwords takenfrom the online version of the HRG6 (excludingentries for persons) with the 4881 stemmed index5In the linguistic sense; ANSI/NISO (2005) defineshomonyms and polysemes differently and would refer tohomographs in this context without distinguishing whetherone or more lexemes are involved.6http://www.hrgdigital.de/terms of our list yielded an intersection of 447matches, i.e., 9% of our index terms also appear asheadwords in the HRG.A closer inspection shows that the rather smallintersection of terms is due to the broader scope ofthe Collection of Swiss Law Sources and the factthat the HRG focuses on German rather than Swisshistory.
The former is illustrated by the fact thatthe second most frequent term in our list of indexterms after Erbrecht is B?cker ?baker?, which doesnot appear in the list of HRG keywords.
Whileprofessional roles related to legal duties like Notar?notary?
or Landvogt ?bailiff?, as well as religiousroles like Papst ?pope?
or Kleriker ?clergyman?
arealso HRG headwords, terminology related to craftsand trades?like Gerber ?tanner?
or Schuhmacher?shoemaker?
?is rare.However, from a legal perspective, the termsin the intersection between the Collection and theHRG are indeed highly relevant.
We also notedthat high-frequency index terms from the Collec-tion are in fact more likely to appear in the list ofHRG headwords than low-frequency terms.
Asexpected, Erbrecht ?inheritance law?, the most fre-quent term in our list of index terms also occurs inthe list of HRG headwords.
A third of the termsappearing three times or more (306 terms) are alsocovered by the HRG (102 headwords), in contrastto an overlap of less than 7% for the terms oc-curring only once in the indices of the Collection.The index terms that occur more than once in ourindices (i.e., 18% of our 4881 base form terms) ac-count for over 46% of the terms in the intersectionwith the HRG headwords.7 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we have described ongoing workon the extraction of index terms from back-of-the-book subject indices in order to build a con-trolled vocabulary for the Collection of Swiss LawSources.
We have used base form reduction forterm conflation and decompounding for discover-ing potential hierarchical relations.We have found that index terms that are alsoHRG headwords are likely to be highly relevant;the terms in the intersection between our indexterms and the HRG headwords will therefore bereviewed by the editors of the Collection to verifywhether they are a good foundation for a controlledvocabulary.28At this point, we have only examined indexterms in modern language.
However, the majority(85%) of modern word forms appears only once;this means that the bulk of the concepts containedin the indices must be represented by historical-language index terms.
For the construction of acontrolled vocabulary it is thus necessary to alsoconsider these terms.While there are only 6370 modern word forms(5160 unique terms) in the subject indices, we haveextracted 41,099 historical word forms (28,860unique terms).
The reduction of about 30% forhistorical versus about 20% for modern terms in-dicates that historical index terms are more evenlyspread across the analyzed volumes.The percentage of historical index terms occur-ring only once is only slightly lower than for mod-ern terms (80% vs. 85%); however, the historicalterms exhibit a high degree of spelling variation.We therefore expect that many terms are spellingvariants that can be conflated.
We are currentlyworking on methods for clustering different histor-ical spellings of related terms.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Pascale Sutter for fruitfuldiscussions and for her historical expertise.ReferencesANSI/NISO.
