An Underspec i f ied  HPSG Representat ionfor In fo rmat ion  S t ructureJonas KuhnInstitut fiir maschinelle SprachverarbeitungAzenbergstratte 12D-70174 Stuttgart, GermanyEmaih  j onas~ims,  un i - s tu t tgar t ,  deAbstracthfformation structure can be of great usein linguistic applications, especially in thoseinvolving a speech component.
However, fo-cus marking by prosody is often ambiguous.Existing theories capture this by rules thatproduce alternative focus structures.
Thisdisjunction is hard to handle computation-ally.
In this paper, a compact, graphicallyunderspecified representation is proposed,along with composition principles and a res-olution routine based on context informa-tion.1 IntroductionThis paper proposes an underspecified represen-tation for information structure (IS) and HPSG 1principles that build up this representation forGerman.
The representation is designed as a ba-sis for use in applications like text-to-speech andspeech translation systems.
It is obvious thatfor a non-tiring, natural output, especially tileprosodic side of IS has to be taken into account.
Inthis section, examples from sentence-based trans-lation with semantic transfer visualize the role ofIS in several empirical domains.
For one thing,ignoring IS may result in confusing translations:(2) with default accenting, 2 despite being truth-conditionally equivalent, is not a suitable transla-tion for (1B) in tile given context.
System userswill probably presume that a serious mistransla-tion occured.
(1) A: Zu unsercm Treffen wird also Frau Ottoyon der Firma Miiller kommen?

')B: Nein, Frau SCHNEIDER wird FirmaNo, Frau Schneider will companyMiiller vertreten.Miiller represent(2) No, Frau Schneider will represent MOLLER'S.1See (Pollard/Sag, 1994).2SMALL CAPS are used to highlight pitch accents.Moreover, IS can be exploited to choose be-tween certain translation alternatives on sentencelevel (of.
(Eberle, 1996)).
The particle noch hasdifferent ranslations depending on accentuation:(3) G. Maria sucht noch einen BRIEFKASTEN.Maria looks@~r still a post-bo~E.
Maria is still looking for a post box.
(4) G. Maria sucht NOCll einen Briefkasten.E.
Maria is looking for another post box.Concluding the set of initial examples, (5) showsthat focus call play a role in simple ilffereneesdrawn from context o resolve lexical ambiguities(or similarly for ellipsis and anaphora resolution).
(5) ~%au S<:hulze kiindigte an, die Firma imHerbst zu besuchen.
('lS"au Schulze announced to visit tile com-pany in autumn.')G.

I assume that the manager will APPI{ECI-ATE her visit.
(6) Ich kann lh'au Miiller nirgends im Geb/iudefinden.
('I can't find Frau Miiller anywhere in thebuilding.')G.
Ich nehme an, (lag die Managerin ihren BE-SUCH begriiBt.E.
I assume that tile manager is giving a wel-come to her VISITORS.Since tile ambiguous Besuch in (5) is not focus-marked, it has to be contextually given.
Evena simple context model will resolve the referenceback to tile besuchen event mentioned in tile pre-ceding sentence, so the noun visit is chosen as atranslation.The last example showed that certain ambigu-ities require inferences from context.
However,the other examples make clear that focus can beeffectively applied in sentence-based translationexploiting the existing linguistic focus markingwithin the sentence.
Costly reasoning can 'thusbe restricted to doubtful cases.670A sentence-based account of IS faces one prob-lem: in the general case, a certain prosodic mark-ing of a sentence does not correspond to a uniqueIS.
These cases of focus ambiguity have been dis-cussed extensiw~ly in the literature and will bebriefly reviewed in see.
2.
The existing HPSGaccount of IS by Engdahl/Val lduvi  (1994) gelmr-ales a disjunction of alternative sentence analysesfor ambiguous entences, a Since focus ambiguitymull;Jiffies with all other kimts of ambiguity, a dis-junctive treatment makes the use of IS in compu-tational applications unattractiw;.
Therefore, anunderspecified representation of IS is proposed inthis paper (sec.
3) along with a resolution routineon the basis of context information (see.
4).
Fi-nally, the linguistic principles that compose therepresentation are worked out in HPSG (see.
5).The data discussed are Gerlnan, but English isvery similar.2 Focus  mark ingThe basic data are well-known.
4 A pitch accenton a direct object like, Buch in (7), can serve tomark a number of constituents as focused: (8).
5The focus Dature is usually assumed to proje.ct.

(9) \[KanL\]~.~ hat ein Buch gelesen(1{}) Maria hat \[DRAUSSEN\]F geniest.Maria has outside sneezedThese data can be explained by the h)llowingF-Assignment Rules fi-om (Selkirk, 1995):a(11) Basic F RuleAn accented word is F-marked.aThe same is true fl)r practically all accounts offocus projection that I am aware of- of., e.g., (Selkirk,:1995; Schwarzschild, 1995).4For German, cf., e.g., (tIShle, 1982).5The standard means to determine the focus of anutterance is the question test, where the tbcus in theanswer corresponds to the interrogative constituent inthe question.
However, this test can be misleadingin cases where the question comes in a wider context(ef.
(16) below and the discussion in (Knhn, 1996)).~Rule (12b) may need some refinement.
It is notclear whether it is a syntactic condition that con-strains indirect F-marking of a head.
Jacobs (1994)argues that the notion of integration or ir~formationalautonomy is resimnsible instead, which is baaed on thecomplexity in semantic processing.
Unibrtunatcly, theformal nature of integration is still ill-understood.
(12) F Projectiona.
F-marking of the head of a phrase licensesthe F-marking of tile phrase.b.
F-marking of an internal argument of ahead licenses the F-marking of the head.According to tiles(; rules, the head itself canproject focus, which appears to be refuted by (b~talike the following.
(13) Karl hat ein Buch \[GEIA!
:SI'\]N.\]FHowever, (13) can have a wider focus if booksare contextually given (this effect has been calleddcaccenting).
Note the diiference between (14)and (15), both marked according to (11) and (12):although their maximal focus domain ix identical,tin Buch is F-marked only in (15).
(14) Karl hat \[ein Buch \[(;ELESEN.\]F\]F(15) Karl hat \[\[ein Buc:n\]l ,, \[gelesen.\]FJFThis is reflected in Schwarzsehild's (1995) in-terl)retation of the F-feature.
All constituentsthat  are not F-marked need to be given, wheregivenness is defined an entaihnent by prior dis-course.
Entaihnent is extended to expressions ofother type than propositions by existentially bind-ing unfilled arguments.
7 Even non-F-marked con-stituents embedded in an F-marked constituent,like em Buch in (14) have to pass this givennessfilter.
So, deaccenting is no longer a special casefor the theory.To restrict the optional focus projection from(12) fllrther, Schwarzschild assumes an additionalpragmatic filter Avoid F that selects the tree withthe least F-marking.
sNon-F-marked constituents that contain F-marked subconstituents need to be giwm as well.The context has to entail their F-skeleton the7The exact definition is as tbllows ((Schwarzschild,1995), pp.

Why shmdd a tree with less F-marking bepragmatically preferred?
One could as well argue thatsince a sentence should be ~s informative as possible,given constituents should be avoided.
The underspec-ified account dewfloped here recasts Schwarzschild'sideas in a way that makes Avoid F redundant.671result of replacing embedded F-marked elementswith variables.
9 This condition allows to explaindata like (16) - a puzzle for theories based on thequestion test for focus (cf.
fn.
5 above).
(16) A: Paula hat eine rote Rose fotografiert.Paula has a red rose photographedWas hat sie davor getan?What has she before doneB: Sie hat eine \[WEISSE\]F Rose fotografiert.She has a white rose photographedA's question leads to expect focus marking ofthe complete VP, but intonational marking plusprojection rules produce a narrow focus on weifle.Schwarzschild (1995) predicts the indicated F-marking, since the F-skeleton of the NP eineweifle Rose, for instance, (a X rose) is actuallyentailed by the context.While non-F-marked constituents have to begiven, F-marked constituents need not necessar-ily be new.
This is to account for data like thefollowing, where ihn in (17B) is given:(17) A: Wen hat Peters Mutter gelobt?Whom has Peter's mother praised?B: Sic hat \[IHN\]F gelobt.She has him praisedThe indicated F-marking follows from the the-ory: there has to be some F-marking, since themeaning of the complete sentence (Peter's motherpraised Peter) is not entailed by the context.
TheF-skeleton variant Peter's mother praised X is ac-tually entailed by the question (17A), thus the F-marking of ihn.3 An  underspec i f ied  representat ionIn computational pplications, a compact repre-sentation is a prerequisite for any successful treat-ment of IS.
Take the following short sentence withtwo pitch accents.
(18) Die Direktorin der Firma MULLER BEGRUSSTThe director of company Miiller welcomesihren Besuch.her visit/visitorsEven if functional elements are ignored, therules in (12) produce nine alternative F-markingsthat have to be checked against the context forgivenness.
In order to resolve the lexical ambi-guity of Besueh however (cf.
the discussion of (5)above), some partial information about IS suffices.The representation developed here is relativelyindependent of the underlying semantic theory offocus.
Two semantical partitions for focus (FOC)and background (BG) are assumed, each of thema set of semantic onditions.
Underspecification isexpressed in a graphical way.
The interpretation 1?9There is some affinity to the f-semantic value inRooth's (1985) alternative semantics, although thespecific details are different.rathe interpretation is given informally in the fol-lowing examples.of each syntactic onstituent forms a node in tilegraph, while the directed edges express accessibil-ity relations.
(19) MARIA begrfiBt ihren BESUCH.Maria welcomes her visit~visitorsMaria begriifltihren Besuchv,, begriiflt', ihren Besuch(20) ", begr/iflt', / ihren Maria', ,'" Bes~/ /.~,BG FOCThe solid line arrows signify obligatory inclu-sion in the respective IS partition, the dashed linearrows defeasible inclusion.
The VP can, e.g., ei-ther belong to FOC (via a chain of arrows) orto BG.
The graph in (20) represents the amountof information that is encoded on sentence levelwithout reference to context.
Additional knowl-edge may introduce further solid arrows.
If, e.g.,a begriiflen event is contextually given (like ina question Who greets whom?
), the arrow frombegriiflt to BG will become an obligatory arrow.This arrow again will overrule the dashed arrowfrom begriiflt to ihren Besuch.
Since the latterwas the only path to access the FOC partition,the complete graph will collapse into a fully spec-ified representation f IS.
Resolution will be dealtwith in more detail in sec.
4.The principles composing the representation areworked out formally in sec.
5.
Here is an intuitiveoverview: the arrows pointing directly to the FOCand BG partition originate from accenting or non-accenting of the single words, respectively.
Theadditional arrows between the constituent nodesare introduced by the grammatical principles ofF-projection irrespective of the actual prosodicmarking.
This becomes clear when we regard thefollowing alternative prosodic marking of (19):(21) MARIA BEGRUSST ihren Besuch.Maria begr/iBtihren Besuch' begrii\]\]t'qhren Besuch(22)  ', , ', , begrfii~t\ ', ,, lhren Maria",', Besuch \ /BG FOGNote that here, the dashed arrow from begriifltto ihren Besuch is overruled right away, sincethe accented begriiflt is strictly tied to FOC.
The672phrase ihren Besuch is forced into tile BG parti-tion, thus the utterance is correctly predicted tobe restricted to contexts where Besueh is given.As anticipated above in tile discussion of the lex-ical ambiguity involved, this conelusioil can bedrawn even if other points remain underspecified.4 Reso lu t ionAn underspecified IS arising from tile prosodicmarking of a sentence can be resolved by informa-tion from the context.
As noted above, entaihnentby context introduces additional solid line arrows.rlb covet" more than just trivial cases, the (:ounter-part of Schwarzschild's (1995) F-skeleton has to bckept track of in the underst)ecified representation.At first glance, this seems to be incompatible withthe idea of underspeeification, since the F-skeletonthat is checked against he context for entailment,requires ettlement on what the actual F-markingis.
For instance, to check the givenncss of the VPin (23), reads a book about X has to be entailed,whereas on the basis of the marking in (24), readsY has to be entailed.
(23) I%anz liest ein Buch filler \[S('ml"FE.\]Fl~'anz reads a book about ships(24) bYanz liest \[ein Buch filler \[ScHnq"m\]F\]FThe solution lies in the observation that the lat-ter F-skeleton entails the former.
So, when a cer-tain constituent (e.g., again the VP in the abow~examples) is checked for givenness, it suffices toassume F-marking of the maximal potentially F-marked subconstituents (I call this the maximalityassumption).
If it turns out that the actual F-marking is more restricted, this will be detectedat a lower level.
For example, if (23) is the rightsolution, this will be discovered even if reads abook about X is not checked, since in this case, abook about X will be contextually given as well.To illustrate resolution in tile graph representa-tion, take the following example in context:(25) a. Amta hat Otto fotografiert.Anna has Otto photographedl).
HANS hat Otto ein Bv(,n gegeben.Hans has to-Otto a book givenSentence (25t)) produces the following graph:(Hans hat Otto ein Buch gegeben,(3P, ue  C)\[P(u)\]}(Ot\[o ein Buch gegeben,(3R~ C)(~:~)\[n(x,Otto)\])/ / (ein Buch gegeben,(3Q, z e C)(3x, y)\[q(x, y, z)\]} (26) 1 / ,~-.I \] ..""

' - ' - - '" ' -  (ein B ~BG FOCThe nodes are now labelled by pairs.
The firstelement of a pair is tile semantic wflue of the con-stituent corresponding to the node (here again ex-pressed inforlnally in natural language); the sec-ond eleinent is the F-skeleton based on the max-imality assumption - the F-skeleton is obtainedby (i) replacing the maximal F-marked subcon-stituents (or sister constituents, in the case of in-direct F-marking of the head, following (12b)) bya variable, (it) existentially binding unfilled argu-ments, and (iii) existentially quantifying over thevariables from the F-skeleton (cf.
also fit.
7).
Thelatter quantification is restricted by the set of con-textually salient values C.In resolving underspecifieation from context,it is checked for each node with access to theBG t)artition ~t whether its F-skeleton is en-tailed by an antecedent in the context.
Forgegeben and the lowest verb projection einBuch gcgeben, there is no such antecedent inthe context.
However, for the VP Otto cinBueh gegeben the VP from (25a) Otto fo-tografiert is a suitable antecedent: after exis-tential binding, (~x) fotografieren(x,Otto) entails(~R C C)(3x)\[R(x,Otto)\].
Similarly for the con>plete sentence: fotogrMieren(Anna,Otto) entails(3e,  u C C)\[P(u)\].
So, solid line arrows replacethe two dashed arrows pointing to BG (suggestedin (26) by tile longer dashes).The status of tile lower verb projections in (26)is still underspecified.
If a wider context was con-sidered, antecedents could possibly be found, so itmakes sense to end 1, t) with such a representationafter processing the discourse (25).

Since all acce.nt on a word intro-duces just an arrow towards FOC, narrow focus on aword survives the check even in cases where the wordis given.12For examples with several ambiguous accents, themodified account collapses ome F-markings with min-imal diffcrm,ces in inte.rpretation i to one.
For in-stance, two of the twelve F-markings for (i) are in-distinguishable: (it) and (iii).

l~lrthermore, Schwarzschild's prag-matic condition Avoid F that selects the analysiswith the least F-marking (cf.
fn.
8) is no longerneeded.5 HPSG principlesThe representation proposed in sec.
3 and 4 canbe implemented irectly in a sign-based formalismlike HPSG.
In this section, tile central compositionprinciples for German are worked out.
A binarybranching structure is assumed.
Again, the repre-sentation will be fairly open as to which particularsemantic formalism is chosen.
This is reflected intile Semantics Principle I assume, which specifiesthe semantic value of a phrase as the application ofa two-place function compose to the semantic val-ues of both daughters.
The function can be speltout in different ways depending on the choice of asemantic theory, la Furthermore, a function vari-able is assumed that maps a semantic object to anew variable of the same type.The HPSG type cont (the value of theCONT(ENT) feature) has the following four newfeatures: O-SEM ('ordinary semantics') andI,'-SKEL (F-skeleton) of the type of a semantic ob-ject, tile set-valued IS-CSTR (IS constraints) andthe binary MAX-F (for potential maximal focus).The phonological information is enriched by afeature PROM (prominence) with values accentedand unaccented.The following principles specify the lS-CSTR setfor a sign, introducing arrows, or links, between(i) Der Direktor der SPARKASSE begr/it3te FrauThe director of-the savings-bank greeted FrauMAIEIt.Maier(ii) Der Direktor der \[SPARKASSE\]F begrfiftte \[FrauMA,E~.\] F(iii) \[Der Direktor der \[SPARKASSE\]F\]F begrfiflte\[Frau MAIER.\]FHowever, such a context is quite intricate to construct.Here is an example:(iv) Der Direktor der Firma ABC sat~ im C~f~.The director of company ABC sat in-the careDer Kellner begriiflte eine Bekannte.The waiter greeted a friendContext (iv) does not entail der Direktor der Xbegriiflte Y, so (ii) is ruled out according toSchwarzschild's system.
The resolution process pro-posed in this paper is based on the maximality as-sumption, and thus checks givenness for the com-plete sentence only once, with the complete subjectF-marked.
To rescue the difference between (ii) and(iii), it would have to be enforced that resolution ofthe subject NP takes place before the resolution of thefocus projected from the object.
This is a conceivablesolution - however, declarative perspiguity would besacrificed for a very moderate benefit, considering themain point of this paper.lain the example below, simple predicate-argumentsemantics is used for illustration.semantic objects.
(Tim IS part i t ions /oc  and bgare here also treated as semantic objects.)
Theh_link relation corresponds to the obligatory (solidline) arrows in the graphs, s_link reflects defeasi-ble (dashed line) arrows.
In the following, the linkrelations are expressed verbally.
(27) is the coun-terpart to (11); (28) and (29) reflect clauses (12a)and (12b).
(27) Focus Linking PrincipleThe O-SEM value of a pitch accented word ish_linked to foe.
(28) Head F-Projection PrincipleThe O-SEM value of a phrase is s_linked to theO-SEM value of its head daughter.
(29) Indirect Head F-Marking PrincipleIn a head-complement-structure, wh re none ofthe head daughter's arguments have yet beensaturated, 14 the O-SEM of the head daughter iss_linked to the O-SEM value of the complementdaughter.These three principles establish direct or indi-rect links towards foc.
For the constituents thatare not obligatorily focus marked, the underspec-ified representation requires additional defeasiblelinks to bg:(30) Background Linking PrincipleThe O-SEM value of every sign that is not ac-cented is s_linked to bg.The principles just presented compose the rep-resentation introduced in sec.
3, with the nodesin the graph corresponding to the O-SEM values.To provide the input for the resolution routine,the representation was enriched in sec.
4 by theF-skeleton.
This is kept track of in the F-SKELfeature (assuming independent existential bindingof unfilled argmnents and free variables).
(31) F-Skeleton InstantiationThe F-SKEL value of a word with \[O-SEM (~\] is(i) the function variable(a), if ~ is h_linked tofoc;(ii) a, if the word is marked \[MAX-F __\];15(iii) eomposition(a,fl) (where fl is the F-SKELvalue of the word's complement),if the word is marked \[MAX-F J-J, but a isnot h_linked to foe.
(32) F-Skeleton PrincipleThe F-SKIn, value of a phrase is the functioncompose applied to(i) the F-SKEL vahm of a daughter with\[MAX-F --\]; or(ii) the function variable(a) of a daughter with\[MAX-F J-\] and \[O-SEM O~\];for both daughters.14This formulation will be subject to changes oncethere is a clear concept of integration (cf.
fn.
6) - (29)applies to integrated constitnents.lSThe feature MAX-F is actually redundant.
It hasbeen introduced for convenience, signifying that achain of links to foe exists - a condition that couldbe checked irectly in the graph.
But it does not hurtmuch to carry the feature along in the principles (27)(29).674"IS-CSTR \[\] U \[~\] U { s3ink(m, b q), sdink(N, \[\])\]\]O-S~{M m(= gab'(Bucl{)(Otto')(Hans')) \]MAX-F - t -?

Sincetin Buch bears a pitch accent, the Focus LinkingPrinciple (27) applies, introducing an obligatorylink to FOC (h_link(\[\], foe)).
