A unit can represent  a character  by i t se l f ,  or  it may.be compounded with some other  unit(s).1.1.
S t rokes  and OperatorsA set  of s t rokes  is g iven in the S t roke- tab le  (Table 1).
Eachs t roke  is ident i f ied  by a two-p lace  number  ca l led  "s t roke  ident i f ie r ,  "and is def ined by a s t roke  representat ion  pat tern .
The f i r s t  numera lof the s t roke  ident i f ie r  represents  the c lass  of the s t roke  and thesecond the var ia t ion  with in the c lass .
For  example ,  the s t roke  "21"which is the f i r s t  var ia t iona l  s t roke  of c lass - two ,  is def ined by thes t roke  pat tern  as shown in Fig.

A s t rokewith i ts th ree  funct iona l  points  can be represented  by the fo l lowingfo rmat  ( s - representat ion  for  the s t roke) :\[21; 20, 22j 24\].In th is  representat ion ,  the f i r s t  number  (21) is the s t roke  ident i f ie r ,and the fo l lowing three  sets  of numera ls  represent  the x (on the left)and y (on the r ight)  coord inates  of the points  (~, ~ ~ , and U.J, respec -t ively.Concatenators  a re  l i s ted  in Table 2.

Thes t rokes  thus in ter re la ted  are  ca l leddegenerate  s t rokes .
There  are  two pseudoconcatenators ,  one des ig -nated by - (hyphen) and the o ther  by ~ (zero).~'.-" A pseudoconcatenatora lways  se lec ts  i ts  neares t  p reced ing  and the next fo l lowing s t rokesas the predecessor  and the successor ,  respect ive ly ,  and theses t rokes  must  be long to the same s t roke-c lass .
Any degenerates t rokes  must  be concatenated  (or compounded by a superconcatenator ,see  infr,._._.a) to a s t roke  of the oppos i te  group at the la t te r ' s  p, ins - representat ion.
: ' , - ' *  A s t r ing  in i - representat ion  that does not meetthese  cond i t ions  is b locked in generat ion  and thus is re jec ted  as arepresentat ion  of a unit.The pseudoconcatenators  al lot the same pos i t ion  (in te rms ofthe i r  },t (and often a l so  ~ and u) consequent ly )  coord inates  in s -representat ion  to a pa i r  of ident ica l  or  s imi la r  s t rokes .
The de-generate  s t rokes  in s - representat ion  are  marked  for  the hyphen orthe zero .
The order  of s t roke  occur rences  is genera l ly  p reservedin s - representat ion .
Degeneracy  of more  than two s t rokes  are  nota l lowed.
In the ac tua l i za t ion  process ,  as d i scussed  la ter ,  degener -acy c reated  by the hyphen is reso lved  and the degenerate  s t rokes~',-" In ear l ie r  repor ts  of our  study,  we  assumed the hyphen and  a com-ma as pseudoconcatenators .

** There  are  some fur ther  res t r i c t ions  about  the k ind  of s t rokes  tobe  degenerate  and  those  to be  concatenated  to degenerate  s t rokes ,and  a lso  about  combinat ion  of these.

3 - Examples  of char -ac ters  generated  by  use  ofpseudoconcatenators .
(degenerate  vs. reso lved)In the case of the zero,  the strokesare separated in the same manner ,  butat the same t ime a specia l  stroke of theopposite c lass (horizontal l ine for c lass-2 degenerate strokes and ver t i ca l  l inefor c lass-1 degenerate strokes) is auto-mat ica l ly  introduced in s - representat ion .Th is  add i t iona l  s t roke  has  an  "infinitesi-ma l  length,  " and  this b r idges  the pert i -nent  two  (degenerate)  s t rokes .
Wherethis b r idge  shou ld  be  p laced  a long  thedegenerate  s t rokes  is determined ,  afterthe unit has  been  completed  in s - repre -sentat ion,  accord ing  to a pre ferenceorder  that is g iven  by  convent ion  of thisrule sys tem.
The  pre ference  order  forthe se lec ted  point on  the degenerates t rokes  is Oh, c~ ?
and  ~ , but if a par -t icular point shows  co inc idence  w i th  anyo ther  stroke(s) ,  i. e. , when the point isused  as a junct ion  in the pat tern ,  thispoint is avo ided  and  the point w i th  thenext  degree  of p re ference  is se lec tedfor p lac ing  the in f in i tes ima l  stroke.
Thein f in i tes imal  s t roke  becomes  "s t re tched"when the degenerate  s t rokes  separate ,g iv ing  an actua l  b r idg ing  between them.The  in f in i tes imal  s t roke  can  be  p lacedon ly  at a point where  the funct iona lpoints  (of the same kind) of the degener -ate s t rokes  co inc ide.The  zero  can  be  used  repeated ly  in the same space  between apa i r  of (degenerate)  s t rokes  in i - representat ion .
Each  symbo l  ofzero inserts an infinitesimal stroke at the place of the highest prefer-ence that remains available.
Examples for the use of degeneratestrokes and the pseudoeoncatenators are given in Fig.

The  Dummy Concatenator  "?
"A eoncatenator  in genera l  concatenates  a s t roke  wi th  anotherstroke.
We in t roduce  a dummy concatenator  "?
,  " so that we  mayconcatenate  a s t r ing w i th  another  string.
The  "?"
in i - representa -t ion marks  its immediate ly  p reced ing  s t roke  as the predecessor  ofa eoncatenator  that remains  to be  spec i f ied later in the str ing in con-junct ion  w i th  the se lec ted  successor  stroke.
In the str ing fo l lowingthis dummy concatenator ,  an  ext raneous  concatenator  must  be foundconsecut ive ly  fo l lowing another  eoneatenator  wi thout  a s t roke  identi-f ier in between,  and  the second concatenator  in the sequence  se lectsthe s t roke  marked  prev ious ly  by  "?"

Thefo l low ing  s t roke  serves  as  the successor  for  both  of the concatenatorsin pair ,  thus spec i fy ing  a junct ion  of two  str ings.

Therea re  some more  res t r i c t ions  of  a gener -al  k ind  g iven  in te rms  of  the  der ived  s-representat ion .
These  res t r i c t ionsmay be  in terpreted  as  f i l te r ing  func -t ions  of  the  t rans format iona l  p rocessof  ac tua l i za t ion  ( see  ~ 3).One  ra ther  obv ious  res t r i c t ion  is that  no  s t rokes  of  the  samec lass  except  degenerate  ones  can  share  the  same set  o f  coord inateva lues  fo r  any  members  of  the i r  funct iona l  po in ts ,  whether  they  botha re  of  the  same k ind  ( 06 , ~ ,  o r  ~)  o r  d i f ferent .

A s t r ing ,  fo r  example ,  l ike  / I IC21S I I / ,however ,  is permiss ib le  in i - representat ion  but  must  be  re jec ted  bythe  c r i te r ion  s ta ted  above .Another  poss ib le  res t r i c t ion  that  may be  imposed  on  an  s - repre -sentat ion  of  a uni t  is in te rms  of the  ra t io  of  the  la rgest  d imens ion  ofthe  generated  pat tern  to the  number  of s t rokes  ut i l ized.

It may  well be the case that this kind of restriction ~is sostrong that we  can totally omit spccit'ying the variation numbers  ofthe strokes for the input transcription of any character.
Thesepoints remain  to be investigated.2.
Compound ing  of  Un i t sMore  than one unit can be compounded to fom-n a complex  unit,which in turn as a unit can be compoui ided with ~nother unit.
Thederivation of a character  by a sequence of compound ing  can berepresented  in i - representat ion  by  recurs ive  use  of pa i r s  of paren-theses ,  each  sur round ing  a subst r ing  as  a unit, A more  i l lustrat iverepresentat ion  may be  g iven  in a fo rm of t ree  d iagram,  where  thetype  of compound ing  is g iven  by  the compounder  symbo l  at each  node(see F ig .

In some cases  the succeed ing  unit is com-posed  of more  than  one  s t roke ,  where  on ly  one  of them can  be  des ig -t2nated  as  the "major  s t roke"  that  determines  the manner  of compound-ing.

Ac tua l i za t ionA character  is t ranscr ibed  as a set  of units combined  throughcompounders  in any depth of complex i ty .
Each const i tuent  unit ist ranscr ibed  as a s t r ing  in i - representat ion  p laced  in parentheses .The i - representat ions  of units determine  the i r  s - representat ions ,spec i fy ing  pos i t ion ing  of all occur rences  of s t rokes  in a f rame of thepat tern  field.
The  franle is normal i zed  and  p laced  together  accord -ing to the spec i f i ca t ion  of the compounder  to fo rm a compound unit,and  this p rocess  of normal i za t ion  and  abutt ing can  be  recurs ive ly  re-peated.
The  set of ru les  for  normal i za t ion  and  s t roke  reduct ion  (seesupra}  is thus  cyc l ic  in the sense  of the cycl ic i ty of phono log ica lrules.

S t roke  Ar rangementIt may  be  obv ious  intuit ively that in the ac tua l i zed  fo rm of any14character  the const i tuent  s t rokes  are  d i s t r ibuted  in space  somehowevenly.
Th is  fact  can be accounted  fo r  by des ign ing  a la ter  par t  ofthe ac tua l i za t ion  process  to fo rm a set  of s t roke  d i s t r ibut ion  ru les .As a genera l  p r inc ip le  for  th is  d i s t r ibut ion  of s t rokes  in space ,  wemay assume a potent ia l  f ie ld def ined in the s t roke  pat tern  of eachs t roke  sur round ing  the ac tua l i zed  shape  of the s t roke .
We then mayhypothes ize  that superpos i t ion  of the potent ia l s  be long ing  to the d is -t r ibuted  s t rokes  in the f inal ly  ac tua l i zed  pat tern  resu l t s  in a s tate  ofequ i l ib r ium by at ta in ing  the tota l  potent ia l  energy  min imum.

P rac t i ca l  Approx imat ionA pract i ca l  approx imat ion  for  th is  p r inc ip le  of d i s t r ibut ion  maybe dev ised  as  fo l lows.
Each s t roke  has a two-d imens iona l  measureof spac ia l  occupancy  for  x and y d i rec t ions ,  def ined in a s t roke  table.A "s i ze  normal i za t ion  fac tor "  of a unit is  def ined as the sum of thesemeasures  of occupancy  of al l  the const i tuent  s t rokes .
The areawhich is occup ied  by each const i tuent  unit in a complex  unit is  deter -mined  by the propor t ion  in te rms of the "s i ze  factor .
"Within a unit,  the ac tua l i zed  d i s t r ibut ion  of const i tuent  s t rokesis at ta ined in a s imi la r  manner ,  by a l lowing typ ica l ly  equal  spacesbetween s imi la r  s t rokes  in the d i rec t ion  perpend icu la r  to the s t rokel ine.

It is obv ious ly  t rue  that the same char -ac ter  can  be  generated  by  di f ferent i - representat ions ,  par t ly  due  todi f ferent s t roke  orders  and  par t ly  due  to d i f ferent  se lec t ion  of var ia -t ional  shapes  of s t rokes .

The  use  ofdegeneracy  aga ins t  compound-ing g ives  still another  sort  ofambigu i ty .
Thus  for example ,the character  can  be  gener -a ted e i ther  as a s imp le  unit/ I I~ I IX21/  or  as  a compoundedfo rm /(21SI IP21T I  \] )X(21)/.These  sor ts  of ambigu i tyhave  been  to a la rge  extent  e l im-inated by  some care  taken  info rmulat ing  the rule sys tem,but some of them are  interest -ing and  seem to ind icate theinherent  p rob lems concern ingthe nature  of Ch inese  characters .The  sys tem we have  g iven  hereis concrete  and  val id in fair de-tails, but it is still sub ject  toeven  major  changes  for impr 'ove-ment .
The  essent ia l  pr inc ip le ,however ,  seems to us conv inc -ingly ef fect ive for descr ip t ionof the graph ica l  s t ruc tures  ofthe characters .Fig.

The sys tem may be cons idered  as agenerat ive  grammar  of the set  of character  pat terns .
A unit isfo rmed by concatenat ing  s t rokes  by operators .
A set  of s t rokes  isgiven in a s t roke  table  where  three  abst rac t  funct iona l  po ints  ~ ,, ,u ,  t~ , as  wel l  as a typ ica l  ac tua l i za t ion  fo rm,  a re  def ined foreach s t roke .
Concatenators  and pseudoconcatenators  a re  prov ided ,each of them def in ing a par t i cu la r  pos i t iona l  in ter re la t ion  betweentwo s t rokes  in te rms of co inc idence  of the funct iona l  points .
Theset  of s t rokes  is d iv ided into two funct iona l ly  d is t inc t  g roups ,  anda concatenator  can combine  only a pa i r  of s t rokes  of d i f fe rent  g roups ,a pseudoconcatenator  only those  of the same group.
Thus a s t r ing  ofa l te rnat ing  s t rokes  and operators ,  which may be ca l led  the " i - repre -sentat ion ,  " determines  an under ly ing  fo rm of a unit ,  which can beac tua l i zed  as a character  shape through looking up the s t roke  tableand execut ing  some shape-ad jus t ing  ru les .
On the leve l  of i - repre -sentat ion ,  more  than one unit can be combined  to fo rm a more  com-plex character  pat tern ,  by use of one or  more  of compound ing  oper -a tors  that spec i fy  " t rans format iona l  p rocesses"  to be executed  be-fo re  the shape  ad jus tment  process .
