The work is carriedout on the material of sports newspublished in Russian media.1 IntroductionMany Semantic Web applications need amuch deeper semantic analysis of the textthan is used today.
Not only should theontology elements be extracted from thetextual data but also it is important tointerpret the text in terms of the ontology.
Itis essential that IE and QA systems should beable to discover semantic similarity betweenthe texts if they express the meaning indifferent ways.
Cf.
synonymous sentences (1)?
(3):(1) Real Madrid and Barcelona will meet inthe semi-finals on Thursday.
(2) The semi-final match between RealMadrid and Barcelona will take place onThursday.
(3) The adversary of Real Madrid in the semi-finals on Thursday will be Barcelona.If we wish to extract the meaning from thetext irrespective of the way it is conveyed, weshould construct a semantic analyzer capableof producing identical semantic structures forsentences (1)-(3), or at least semanticstructures whose equivalence can be easilydemonstrated.The problem becomes much more difficultif text understanding includes access to text-external world knowledge.
For example,sentences (1)-(3) describe the same situationas (4).
(4) The semi-finals on Thursday will see thechampion of the UEFA Champions League2008-2009 and the team of Manuel Pelle-grini.To account for this synonymy, the systemshould know that it was the football clubBarcelona who won the UEFA ChampionsLeague in 2008-2009, and that Manuel Pelle-grini is the coach of Real Madrid.
This im-plies that linguistic knowledge should belinked with ontological resources.
The crea-tion of a semantic analyzer of this type goesfar beyond the task of assigning ontologicalclasses to words occurring in the text.
It re-quires a powerful wide-coverage linguisticprocessor capable of building coherent se-mantic structures, a knowledge-extensivelexicon, which contains different types oflexical information, an ontology, which de-scribes objects in the domain and their prop-erties, a repository of ground-level facts, andan inference engine.67A project NOVOFUT aiming at the devel-opment of a semantic analyzer of this type forRussian texts has started at the Institute forInformation Transmission Problems of theRussian Academy of Sciences.
It covers thedomain of news about football.
There areseveral reasons for this choice of domain.First, the news texts are written primarily forthe general public, so that their understandingdoes not require specialized expert knowl-edge.
This is a major advantage since it sig-nificantly facilitates the acquisition of theontology.
Second, the language typical ofsports journalism is rich enough, whichmakes its interpretation linguistically non-trivial.
Last but not least, sports enjoy enor-mous public interest.
There are many sportsportals publishing multifarious informationon the daily (and sometimes hourly) basis andvisited by a lot of people.
Enhanced Ques-tion-Answering and Information Extraction inthis domain are likely to attract many users.The NOVOFUT semantic analyzer reusesmany types of resources created or accumu-lated by the team in previous work.
In thispaper we focus on the static resources usedby the analyzer ?
the lexicon and the ontol-ogy.
The plan of the presentation is as fol-lows.
In Section 2 we discuss related work.
InSection 3 we will briefly describe the linguis-tic processor we build on and its lexicon.
Sec-tion 4 outlines a small-scale ontology devel-oped for the project.
The correlation betweennatural language words as presented in thelexicon and the ontology is the main concernof Section 5.
In Section 6 the interface be-tween the ontology and the lexicon is dis-cussed.
Future work is outlined in Section 7.2 Related workThe link between the ontologies and NL textsis investigated in two directions ?
?from theontology towards NL texts?
and ?from thetexts towards the ontology?.
In the first casewritten texts are used as a means for ontologyextension and population.
To name but a fewauthors, McDowell and Cafarella (2006) startfrom an ontology and specify web searchesthat identify in the texts possible semanticinstances, relations, and taxonomic informa-tion.
In (Schutz and Buitelaar 2005) an inter-esting attempt is made to extract ontologicalrelations from texts.
(Buitelaar et al 2008,Magnini et al 2006, Maynard & al.
2006) arefurther advances in the direction of ontologypopulation.Finding NL equivalents to ontologicalelements and be monolingual or multilingual.A metamodel for linking conceptual knowl-edge with its lexicalizations in various lan-guages is proposed in (Montiel-Ponsoda et al2007).The second direction research starts fromNL texts and tries to interpret them in termsof the ontology.
In most cases, this takes theform of marking the text with ontologicalclasses and instances.
A typical example is(Sanfilippo et al 2006).
One should alsomention the work based on the GeneralizedUpper Model (GUM), which is meant for in-terfacing between domain models and NLcomponents (Bateman et al 1995)Our work belongs to this second direction,but our aim is not limited to finding ontologi-cal correlates to words.
In many aspects wewere inspired by the ontological semanticapproach developed in the Mikrokosmosframework (cf.
Nirenburg and Raskin 2004).We share many of its postulates and concretesolutions.
In particular, semantic analysis ofthe text should be based on both linguisticand extra-linguistic knowledge.
Linguisticknowledge is implemented in languagegrammars and dictionaries, while extra-linguistic knowledge is comprised in an on-tology, which enumerates concepts, describestheir properties and states interrelationshipsbetween them, and a fact repository whichaccumulates ground-level facts, such as, inour case, the data about concrete players,teams and matches.
To a large extent, the on-tology serves as the semantic language formeaning representation.At the same time, there exist some differ-ences between our approaches determined bythe linguistic model adopted.
Our work isbased on the Meaning ?
Text theory(Mel?
?uk 1974, 1996).
In particular, we makeextensive use of lexical functions, which con-stitute one of the prominent features of thistheory.
Thanks to lexical functions it turnsout possible to reduce a wider range of syn-onymous sentences to the same semantic68structure, and in many cases, improve the per-formance of search engines (see e.g.
Apresjanet al 2009).
Another difference between theMikrokosmos approach and ours concerns thefact that the Mikrokosmos ontology is writtenin a specific in-house formalism.
Our empha-sis is on using as far as possible standard on-tology languages (OWL, SWRL), in order toobtain interoperability with a wide and evergrowing range of semantic web resources andinference engines.3 The ETAP-3 LinguisticProcessor and its Lexicon.The multifunctional ETAP-3 linguistic proc-essor, developed by the Computational Lin-guistics Laboratory of the Institute for Infor-mation Transmission Problems, RussianAcademy of Sciences, Moscow, (see e.g.Apresjan et al 2003), is the product of dec-ades of research and development in the fieldof language modelling.At the moment, ETAP-3 consists of anumber of options, including1) a rule-based machine translation systemworking both ways between Russian andEnglish (plus several prototypes for otherlanguages ?
French, German, Spanish, Ko-rean and Arabic);2) a system of synonymous and quasi-synonymous paraphrasing of sentences;3) an environment for deep annotation oftext corpora, in which SynTagRus, the onlycorpus of Russian texts tagged morphologi-cally, syntactically (in the dependency treeformalism), and lexically was created, and4) a Universal Networking Language(UNL) module, responsible for automatictranslation of natural language text into asemantic interlingua, UNL, and the other wayaround.The ETAP-3 processor is largely based onthe general linguistic framework of the Mean-ing ?
Text theory by Mel??uk.
An importantcomplement to this theory was furnished bythe theory of systematic lexicography andintegrated description of language proposedby Jurij Apresjan (2000).One of the major resources used in ETAP-3 is the combinatorial dictionary.
It offersample and diverse data for each lexical entry.In particular, the entry may list the word?ssyntactic and semantic features, its subcate-gorization frames, as well as rules (or refer-ence to rules) of a dozen types, which make itpossible to describe peculiar behavior of in-dividual words and exceptions to generalrules in a complete and consistent way.
Manydictionary entries contain information onlexical functions, to be discussed below insome detail.The entry of the combinatorial dictionaryhas a number of zones, one of which providesthe properties of the word that are manifestedin the given language, while all the otherzones contain information on the match be-tween this word and its equivalent in a par-ticular language.
For example, the EN zone inthe Russian combinatorial dictionary entrycontains information on the translationalequivalents of the respective Russian wordinto English.
One field (TRANS) gives thedefault single-word translation (or severalsuch translations) of this word in English.Other fields contain less trivial translationrules, or references to such rules.A newly introduced ONTO zone offers in-formation underlying the match between theRussian word and its counterparts in the on-tology.4 Ontology of football.The ontology we are working with focuses inthe first place on football.
It contains infor-mation on teams, players, football field, sportevents, and their properties.
However, wewant it to be extendable to other sports aswell.
That is why some classes are more gen-eral than would be needed for football alone.For example, instead of having one classFootballPlayer, the ontology has amore general class Sportsman, of whichFootballPlayer is a subclass.
Anequivalence restriction states that Foot-ballPlayer is a Sportsman whoseSportType is football.
In this way,sportsmen doing different types of sports canbe treated by the ontology in a uniform way.The football ontology is written in SWRL,which is OWL augmented with rules (Hor-rocks et al 2004).
In compiling it, we usedsome existing ontologies dealing with foot-69ball(http://www.lgi2p.ema.fr/~ranwezs/ontologies/soccerV2.0.daml).
As usual, properties ofclasses are inherited by the subclasses.
Forexample, the Match class is a subclass ofSportEvent, which in its turn is a subclassof Event.
Match inherits from Event theproperties of having definite Time andPlace.
From SportEvent it inherits thefact that its participants should be Sport-Agents.
Its own properties are: the numberof participants is 2 (as opposed to champion-ships, which have more) and it has a definitesport type (as opposed to Olympics, whichinvolve many sport types).
A subclass ofMatch is Derby, in which both participantsshould be from the same city or region.
Thisproperty is implemented by means of aSWRL rule (cf.
below).
Another rule as-signed to Match states that if its sport type isfootball (or any other team sport), then itsparticipants should be teams and not individ-ual sportsmen, as is the case in tennis orchess.
Sportsman is a subclass of twoclasses: Person, from which it inherits theproperty of having a name and a birth date,and SportAgent, which includes alsoTeam and from which it inherits the propertyof having a definite sport type and a coach.5 Correlation between thewords and the elements of the on-tology.As mentioned above, the ontology plays atwo-fold role.
On the one hand, it is a reposi-tory of domain-specific knowledge, and onthe other hand, it is a semantic metalanguageused for representing the meaning of naturallanguage texts.
All meaningful natural lan-guages elements (words, grammatical con-structions, morphological features) must beinterpreted in ontological terms.
This makesthe correlation between the lexicon and theontology far from trivial.
In this section, wewill present several typical situations and il-lustrate them with examples.5.1 One-to-one correspondencebetween NL words and ontologyelements.The simplest situation occurs when a worddirectly corresponds to an ontology element ?a class, an individual, a relation, an attributeor its value.
Example:(5) Real Madrid pobedil Arsenal so s?etom3:1 ?Real Madrid defeated Arsenal 3 to 1?.Here Real Madrid and Arsenal are indi-viduals ?
instances of the Team class, theverb to defeat corresponds to the WinEventclass, and numbers 3 and 1 are values of at-tributes scoreWinner and scoreLoser,respectively.
In the semantic structure (SemS)classes are represented by instances suppliedby a unique numeric identifier.
SemS for sen-tence (5) looks as follows:hasWinner(WinEvent01, Real-Madrid)&hasLoser(WinEvent01,Arsenal)& scoreWinner(WinEvent01,3)&scoreLoser(WinEvent01,1)5.2 One ontology element ?several words (?multi-word con-cepts?
).This is a very typical situation, especially inthe area of terminology.
For example, in or-dinary language ?eltaja karto?ka ?a yellowcard?
is a free noun phrase that simply de-notes a card whose colour is yellow.
In thesports domain, it is a single concept that re-fers to one of several possible punishments areferee can mete out for a rules infraction.Therefore, it is represented as one element inthe ontology.
Some other examples of multi-word sport concepts: uglovoj udar ?corner?,svobodnyj udar ?free kick?, pravyj po-luza?
?itnik ?right tackle?.5.3 One word ?
several onto-logical elements.Many words that can be interpreted in termsof ontological elements do not correspond toany single class, relation or instance.
Theirdefinition consists in a configuration of theseelements.
Most often, it is a class with someof the properties instantiated.
In principle,often there are two options: one can eitherpostulate two different classes (e.g.70Sportsman and FootballPlayer as itssubclass), or only one class (Sportsman)and represent the football player as aSportsman whose SportType property isfootball.
There is no general solution tothis alternative.
In general, it is desirable toobtain a parsimonious ontology and refrainfrom introducing new classes, if one can de-fine a concept in terms of existing classes andtheir properties.
However, if a concept hasimportant properties of its own, it is prefer-able to present it in the ontology as a separateclass.
In our example, FootballPlayerhas Specialization which other sports-men do not have (goalkeeper, for-ward, back, etc.)
For this reason, it is pos-tulated as a separate class of the ontology,with the indication of its equivalence to theanonymous class ?Sportsman andhasSportType football?.An interesting and typical case are adjecti-val modifiers to nouns of the type ispanskij?Spanish?, francuzskij ?French?, moskovskij?of Moscow?, and the like.
Usually, dictionar-ies provide a very general definition of suchwords.
For example, the COBUILD Englishdictionary gives only one meaning for theadjective Spanish: ?belonging or relating toSpain, or to its people, language or culture?.However, in real life situations this word isoften interpreted by the speakers in a morespecific way, according to the context.
Onto-logical description should try, as far as possi-ble, to take contextual factors into accountand make explicit the specific interpretationof the modifier in each particular case.
Some-times, it can be done by means of rules thatrefer to ontological categories.
For example,the meaning of the adjective ispanskij ?Span-ish?
mentioned above, when applied to geo-graphical objects (rivers, cities, mountains,roads, etc.
), narrows down to (hasLoca-tion Spain).
If this adjective modifies anoun denoting an industrial or agriculturalproduct (car, wine, olive oil, etc.
), it is ratherinterpreted as (producedIn Spain).We will hardly understand the phrase Spanishwine as denoting the wine located in Spain.Textual objects (songs, literature, poetry,etc.)
move the adjective towards denoting theSpanish language: (inLanguage Span-ish).
Of course, these rules are not alwayssufficient for disambiguation.
If an objectfalls into more than one category, several in-terpretations are possible.
In particular, abook is both a textual and a consumer object.Therefore, a Spanish book can be interpretedas a book written in Spanish, and as a bookpublished in Spain.In many cases, adjectives serve as argu-ments of nouns.
The semantic role of this ar-gument may be different for different nouns(cf.
(6-8)), and even for the same noun (cf.
(9-11)):(6) presidential decree ?
?the president issueda decree?
:hasAgent(decree,president);(7) presidential elections ?
?somebody electsthe president?
: hasOb-ject(elect,president);(8) Babylonian invasion ?
?Babylon invadedsome city or country?
:hasAgent(invade,Babylon); but not?some city or country invaded Babylon?
:hasObject(invade,Babylon);(9) economic advisor ?
?advises in the area ofeconomics?
: has-Topic(advisor,economics);(10) American advisor:  hasNational-ity(advisor,USA);(11) presidential advisor ?
?advises to thepresident?
: hasAd-dressee(advisor,president).5.4 A word is interpreted in on-tological terms but does not have anyfixed ontological equivalent.There is a large class of words that denoteindividuals which are in a certain relation toother individuals: brother, sister, uncle, wife,friend, enemy, classmate, co-author, co-regent, coeval, adversary, ally, etc.
Ofcourse, these words can be easily representedas ontology properties: has-Brother(John, Bill), hasSis-ter(John, Mary).
However, such rep-resentation does not reveal the meaning of theconcepts.
Being a brother of somebody meansbeing a male and having common parentswith this person.
This meaning shares thesecond component (?having common par-ents?)
with the property of being a sister and71differs from it in the first component (?beinga male?).
Such a definition of meanings re-quires the use of variables.
This is the pointwhere the OWL expressive capacity is insuf-ficient and one has to recur to SWRL rules:Person(?person1)&Gender (?per-son1,male)&hasParent(?person1,?person3) &hasParent (?per-son2,?person3)?brother(?person1, ?person2)Person(?person1)&Gender (?per-son1,female)&hasParent(?person1, ?person3)& hasParent (?per-son2,?person3)?
sis-ter(?person1,?person2)In a similar way one can define the conceptof adversary (in sports), as used for examplein sentence (3) above.
Adversary of Z issomeone different from Z who plays in thesame match as Z:SportAgent(?agent)&Match(?match)& hasPartici-pant(?match,?agent)& hasPar-ticipant(?match,?z)& differ-entFrom(?agent,?z) ?
adver-sary(?agent,?z)Among the words that require variables fortheir ontological definition are not only rela-tional nouns.
There are many other words thatcannot be translated into ontological catego-ries without claiming identity (or difference)of the properties of some individuals.
Hereare some examples from the football domain.A derby is a match whose participants arefrom the same city or region.
Our ontologydefines the concept of derby as follows:hasParticipant(?match, ?par-ticipant1)& hasParticipant(?match, ?partici-pant2)&differentFrom (?par-ticipant1,?participant2)&hasLocation (?participant1,?location) &hasLocation (?par-ticipant2,?location) ?derby(?match)Pobednyj gol (?decisive goal?)
is a goalwhich was scored when both teams had equalscore and which was the last goal in thematch.
However, since having no subsequentgoals cannot be expressed in SWRL we willconvey this idea by saying that the goalbrought the victory in the match to one of theteams.
We will need the following classesand properties:GoalEvent, with the properties:hasAgent, atMinute, e.g.
on the tenthminute, inMatch, hasResult (inher-ited from the more general class Event).SituationInMatch (the score at agiven moment), with the properties: in-Match, atMinute, scorePartici-pant1, scoreParticipant2.WinEvent, with the properties:hasWinner, hasLoser.Team, with the property hasPart, to befilled by instances of Sportsman.Besides that, we need the propertytimeImmediatelyBefore, inherited bymoments of time from Time.We will describe the situation by means oftwo rules.
Rule (12) says that the goal thatbrought a victory can be called a decisivegoal.
Rule (13) complements this descriptionby saying that if a goal brings a victory, thewinner is the team whose player scored it andthis goal was scored at the moment whenboth teams had equal score.
(12) GoalEvent(?goal)&WinEvent(?victory)& hasRe-sult(?goal,?victory) ?decisiveGoal(?goal)(13) hasResult(?goal,?victory)&hasAgent(?goal,?player)& has-Part (?team,?player)&atMinute(?goal,?min0)&inMatch (?goal,?match)& timeImmediatelyBe-fore(?min1,?min0)& Situation-InMatch (?situation)&inMatch(?situation,?match)& atMinute(?situation,?min1) ?hasWinner(?victory,?team)&scoreParticipant1(?situation,?n) &scoreParticipant2(?situa-tion,?n).5.5 Ontology and Lexical Func-tions.A lexical function (LF), in the Meaning ?Text theory (Mel'?uk 1996), has the basicproperties of a multi-value mathematical72function.
A prototypical LF is a triple of ele-ments {R, X, Y}, where R is a certain generalsemantic relation obtaining between the ar-gument lexeme X (the keyword) and someother lexeme Y which is the value of R withregard to X (by a lexeme in this context wemean either a word in one of its lexical mean-ings or some other lexical unit, such as a setexpression).
Here are some examples for  theOper1 and Oper2 functions: Oper1 (control) =exercise (control), Oper1 (research) = do (re-search), Oper1 (invitation) = issue (an invita-tion), Oper1 (doubt) = have (doubts), Op-er1 (defeat) = suffer (a defeat), Oper1 (victory)= gain (a victory), Oper1 (campaign) = wage(a campaign), Oper2 (control) = be  under(control), Oper2 (analysis) = undergo (ananalysis), Oper2 (invitation) = receive (aninvitation), Oper2 (resistance) = encounter(resistance), Oper2 (respect) = enjoy (re-spect), Oper2 (obstacle) = face (an obstacle).Y is often represented by a set of synony-mous lexemes Y1, Y2, ?., Yn, all of thembeing the values of the given LF R with re-gard to X; e. g., Magn (desire) = strong /keen / intense / fervent / ardent / overwhelm-ing.
All the LF exponents for each word arelisted in the lexicon.LFs have a strong potential for advancedNLP applications.
Apresjan et al (2007)shows how LFs can be used in parsing, ma-chine translation, paraphrasing.
In parsing,LFs are used to resolve or reduce syntacticand lexical ambiguity.
The MT system resortsto LFs to provide idiomatic target languageequivalents for source sentences in whichboth the argument and the value of the sameLF are present.
The system of paraphrasingautomatically produces one or several syn-onymous transforms for a given sentence orphrase by means of universal LF-axioms; forexample: He respects [X] his teachers ?
Hehas [Oper1(S0 (X))] respect [S0 (X)] for histeachers ?
He treats [Labor1-2(S0 (X))] histeachers with respect ?
His teachers enjoy[Oper2(S0(X))] his respect.
It can be used in anumber of advanced NLP applications rang-ing from machine translation to authoring andtext planning.In ontologically-oriented semantic analysisdifferent LFs are reflected in different ways.An LF corresponds to an ontological class.Many LFs represent bundles of words that aresemantically identical or very close and there-fore can serve as representatives of this com-mon meaning.
We illustrate this with twoclosely related LFs (Apresjan et al 2008).The meaning covered by LiquFunc0 is ?tocause to cease to exist or to be taking place?.This concept corresponds, in particular, to thefollowing English verbs: to stop (the aggres-sion), to lift (the blockade), to dispel (theclouds), to demolish (the building), to dis-perse (the crowd), to avert (the danger), tocure (the disease), to close (the dispute), tobreak up (the family), to annul (the law), todissolve (the parliament), to denounce (thetreaty), to bridge (the gap).
Another LF of theLiqu family ?
LiquFact0 ?
refers to a differentkind of elimination.
It means ?to cause tocease functioning according to its destina-tion?.
When somebody closes the eyes, theydo not cease to exist, they only stop function-ing.
Some more examples: shut down (thefactory), stop (the car), land (the airplane),depose (the king), switch off (the lamp), neu-tralize (the poison), empty (the bucket).These LFs, along with several dozen oth-ers, play a significant role not only in textunderstanding and generation.
They contrib-ute in an interesting way to one of the crucialfunctions of ontologies ?
inference of implicitknowledge.
Important inference rules can beeasily formulated in terms of LFs: if theblockade is lifted (=LiquFunc0), it does notexist any more.
Another example of the LF-based inference (this time it is LF Real1): Hefulfilled (= Real1) the promise to buy a bicycle?
He bought a bicycle.It should be emphasized that, given a lexi-con which contains LF data (which is the caseof our ETAP dictionary), the acquisition ofthis part of the ontology is straightforward.An LF generates an ontological relation.This case can be illustrated by support verbsof the Oper-Func-Labor family that attachone of the arguments to the noun.
For exam-ple, in sentence Father gave me an advice thesubject of the Oper1-support verb to give (fa-ther) is the Agent of advice, while in Theproposal received much attention the subject73of the Oper2-support verb to receive (the pro-posal) is the Object of attention.
Other exam-ples of Oper1 and Oper2 were given in 5.5above.
Some examples of other LFs of thisfamily:Func1: (fear) possesses (somebody), (ru-mour) reaches (somebody), (the blame) fallson (somebody) / (the blame) lies with (some-body), (control) belongs to (somebody), (re-sponsibility) rests with (somebody).Func2: (proposal) consists in (something),(criticism) bears upon (something), (revenge)falls upon (somebody).Labor1-2: keep (something) under (control),submit (something) to (analysis), meet (some-body) with (applause), put (somebody) under(arrest), hold (somebody) in (contempt),bring (something) into (comparison withsomething), take (something) into (considera-tion).An LF has no ontological correlate.This is the case of Func0.
This LF neither de-notes a concept, nor attaches an argument to aconcept.
It only duplicates the meaning of itskeyword and has no correlate in the SemS.For example, in sentence (2) above the phrasethe match took place (= Func0) is only repre-sented by the concept Match.
Other exam-ples of Func0: (the snow) falls, (the wind)blows, (the danger) exists, (the war) is on,(changes) occur.6 Lexicon ?
Ontology in-terface.For the purposes of semantic analysis, theRussian dictionary and the ontology arelinked in the same way as dictionaries of dif-ferent languages are linked in Machine Trans-lation options of the ETAP-3 system.
Asnoted in Section 2, if the system performstranslations from language L to language L?,all dictionary entries of L contain a specialzone (ZONE: L?)
where all translation vari-ants of the given word into L?
are recorded.The semantic analysis option uses the ONTOzone of the Russian dictionary.
In this zone,two types of information may be written:?
Default translation.
This is a one-word equivalent of the given word, which isused if no translation rule is applicable.For example, Russian komanda ?team?
hasthe Team class as its ontological counterpart.This is written in the ontological zone of ko-manda as follows:ZONE: ONTOTRANS: TeamNames of ontological individuals are alsooften translated by default.?
Translation rules.
A rule is writtenevery time one needs to carry out an actionwhich does not boil down to the default trans-lation.Let us give several examples of translationrules written in the ONTO zone of the Rus-sian lexicon.
We will not give their formalrepresentation and restrict ourselves to ex-plaining what they are doing in plain words.Pobeditel?
?winner?
is a SportAgent (i.e.
asportsman or a team) that won some contest:SportAgent(?x)&WinEvent(?y)&hasWinner(?y,?x).Phrases of the type komanda NN ?team ofNN?
(where NN is a proper human name inthe genitive case) are translated in four differ-ent ways depending on the ontological infor-mation assigned to NN.
(a) If NN is the name of a player, thephrase is represented as ?the team of whichNN is a player?
: komanda Arshavina ?Ar-shavin?s team?
= Team(?team)&hasPart(?team,Arshavin).
(b) If NN is the name of a coach, thephrase is represented as ?the team of whichNN is the coach?
: komanda Pellegrini ?Pelle-grini?s team?
= Team(?team)&hasCoach(?team,Pellegrini)(c) If NN is the name of a captain, thephrase is represented as ?the team of whichNN is the captain?
: komanda Iraneka ?Ira-nek?s team?
= Team(?team)& hasCap-tain(?team,Iranek)(d) If NN is neither a player, nor a coach,nor a captain, the phrase is represented as ?theteam of which NN is a fan?
: komanda Ivana?Ivan?s team?
=  Team(?team)& has-Fan(?team,Ivan)It is well-known that genitive noun phrases(or phrases ?N1 of N2?
in English) are veryvague semantically, and their interpretation isvery much dependent on the context.
Thisexample shows that even within the74part/whole interpretation such a phrase, para-doxically, has two opposite varieties: eitherN2 is part of N1, as in the team of Ar-shavin/Arshavin?s team, or N1 is part of N2,as in the leg of the table.The following examples involve the prop-erty hasLocation, which characterizesboth sport events (The match took place inMadrid), and sport agents (the Ukrainiansportsman, a London club).Frequently, a football match is played in alocation, such that one of the teams is fromthat location while the other is not.
This situa-tion can be represented by the followingSemS:(14)Match(?match)&hasLocation(?match,?place)&hasParticipant(?match, ?team1)&hasParicipant(?match,?team2)&differentFrom(?team1,?team2)&hasLocation(?team1,?place)&?hasLocation(?team2,?place)In the natural language this situation can beviewed from different angles and denoted bydifferent words.Xozjaeva ?home team?
denotes a team thatplays a match in a place it is from, the adver-sary being from a different place.
Gosti ?visi-tors?
is a team that plays a match in a locationdifferent from the place it is from, the adver-sary being the home team.
Prinimat?
?to re-ceive?
means to play a match being a hometeam, to host it.
Igrat?
v gostjax lit.
?to playbeing guests?
means to play a match away.Although all these words correspond to thesame situation (14), their translation rulescannot be identical.
The rules should not onlyintroduce SemS (14), but also assure correctamalgamation of this SemS with SemSs ofother words.
In particular, the rule for prini-mat?
?receive?
should guarantee that in (15)Real Madrid instantiates variable ?team1 of(14), and Barcelona ?
variable ?team2.
(15) Real Madrid prinimal Barcelonu ?RealMadrid hosted Barcelona?The rule for gosti ?visitors?
should see to itthat in (16) hasWinner property ofWinEvent be filled by variable ?team2 of(14):(16) Gosti vyigrali 3:1 ?the visitors won 3 to1?This is assured due to marking ?team2 inthe gosti ?visitors?
rule as the head element ofSemS (14).
Naturally, in the xozjaeva ?hometeam?
rule the same role is assigned to?team1.7 Future work.In the continuation, it is planned to enlargeboth the ontology and ONTO zone of theRussian lexicon.
We are investigating thepossibility of merging our small football on-tology with some existing larger upper levelontology.
The difficult task will be to unifyour semantic rules with the axioms of thisontology.A second direction of our future activity isconnected with another component of the se-mantic analyzer, which we did not touchupon in this paper.
It is the set of semanticrules which are not incorporated into the lexi-con due to their general character.
This com-ponent also requires significant enhancement.An important extension of this work con-sists in introducing an inference componentbased on the SWRL rules.AcknowledgementThis study has received partial funding fromthe Russian Foundation for Humanities (grant No.10-04-00040a), which is gratefully acknowledged.ReferencesApresjan, Ju.
