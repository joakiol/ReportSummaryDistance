We do not only compare this criterionwith a weakly supervised extraction methodbut also with gradable adjectives, i.e.
anotherhighly subjective subset of adjectives that canbe extracted in an unsupervised fashion.
In or-der to prove the robustness of this extractionmethod, we will evaluate the extraction withthe help of two different state-of-the-art senti-ment lexicons (as a gold standard).1 IntroductionSince the early work on sentiment analysis, it hasbeen established that the part of speech with thehighest proportion of subjective words are adjec-tives (Wiebe et al 2004) (see Sentence (1)).
How-ever, not all adjectives are subjective (2).
(1) A grumpy guest made some impolite remarksto the insecure and inexperienced waitress.
(2) The old man wearing a yellow pullover sat on aplastic chair.This justifies the exploration of criteria to automati-cally separate the subjective adjectives from the non-subjective adjectives.In this work, we are interested in an out-of-context assessment of adjectives and therefore eval-uate them with the help of sentiment lexicons.
Weexamine the property of being a predicative adjec-tive as an extraction criterion.
Predicative adjectivesare adjectives that do not modify the head of a nounphrase, but which predicate a property of the refer-ent of a noun phrase to which they are linked via acopula or a control predicate (3).We show that adjectives that frequently occur aspredicative adjectives are more likely to convey sub-jectivity (in general) than adjectives that occur non-predicatively, such as the pre-nominal (attributive)adjectives (4).
A subjective adjective may occurboth as a predicative (3) and a non-predicative (5)adjective and also convey subjectivity in both con-texts.
However, a large fraction of non-subjectiveadjectives do not occur as predicative adjectives (6).

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) ex-tract polar adjectives by a weakly supervised methodin which subjective adjectives are found by search-ing for adjectives that are conjuncts of a pre-definedset of polar seed adjectives.
Wiebe (2000) in-duces subjective adjectives with the help of distribu-tional similarity.
Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000)examine the properties of dynamic, gradable andpolar adjectives as a means to detect subjectivity.Vegnaduzzo (2004) presents another bootstrappingmethod of extracting subjective adjectives with thehelp of head nouns of the subjective candidates anddistributional similarity.
Baroni and Vegnaduzzo534(2004) employ Web-based Mutual information forthis task and largely outperform the results producedby Vegnaduzzo (2004).3 MethodIn the following, we present different features withthe help of which subjective adjectives can be ex-tracted.
For all resulting lists, the adjectives will beranked according to their frequency of co-occurringwith a particular feature.3.1 Extracting Predicative Adjectives (PRD)For the extraction of predicative adjectives, we ex-clusively rely on the output of a dependency parser.Predicative adjectives are usually connected to thesubject of the sentence via the dependency labelnsubj (Example (7) would correspond to Sen-tence (3)).
(7) nsubj(brilliant, idea)3.2 Extracting Gradable Adjectives (GRD)As an alternative extraction method, we considermorpho-syntactically gradable adjectives.
Gradableadjectives, such as nice or small, are adjectives ?thatcan be inflected to specify the degree or grade ofsomething?
(Wiktionary1).
It has been stated in pre-vious work that if some adjective can build a com-parative (e.g.
nicer) or a superlative (e.g.
nicest),then this adjective tends to be subjective (Hatzivas-siloglou and Wiebe, 2000).We employ the property of gradability, since,firstly, it is very predictive towards subjectivity and,secondly, it is the only other unsupervised criterioncurrently known to extract subjective adjectives.
Forthe extraction of gradable adjectives, we rely, on theone hand, on the part-of-speech labels JJR (com-parative) and JJS (superlative).
On the other hand,we also consider adjectives being modified by ei-ther more or most.
For the former case, we needto normalize the comparative (e.g.
nicer) or superla-tive (e.g.
nicest) word form to the canonical positiveword form (e.g.
nice) that is commonly used in sen-timent lexicons.1http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gradable3.3 Weakly-Supervised Extraction (WKS)We also consider a weakly supervised extractionmethod in this paper, even though it is not strictlyfair to compare such a method with our two pre-vious extraction methods which are completely un-supervised.
WKS considers an adjective subjective,if it co-occurs as a conjunct of a previously definedhighly subjective (seed) adjective (8).
In order to de-tect such conjunctions, we employ the dependencyrelation conj.
By just relying on surface patterns,we would not be able to exclude spurious conjunc-tions in which other constituents than the two adjec-tives are coordinated, such as Sentence (10).
(8) This approach is ill-conceived and ineffective.
(9) conj(ill-conceived,ineffective)(10) [Evil witches are stereotypically dressed inblack] and [good fairies in white].We also experimented with other related weakly-supervised extraction methods, such as mutual in-formation of two adjectives at the sentence level (oreven smaller window sizes).
However, using con-junctions largely outperformed these alternative ap-proaches so we only pursue conjunctions here.4 ExperimentsAs a large unlabeled (training) corpus, we chose theNorth American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21)comprising approximately 350 million words ofnews text.
For syntactic analysis we use the Stan-ford Parser (Finkel et al 2005).
In order to decidewhether an extracted adjective is subjective or not,we employ two sentiment lexicons, namely the Sub-jectivity Lexicon (SUB) (Wilson et al 2005) andSO-CAL (SOC) (Taboada et al 2011).
According tothe recent in-depth evaluation presented in Taboadaet al(2011), these two sentiment lexicons are themost effective resources for English sentiment anal-ysis.
By taking into account two different lexicons,which have also been built independently of eachother, we want to provide evidence that our pro-posed criterion to extract subjective adjectives is notsensitive towards a particular gold standard (whichwould challenge the general validity of the proposedmethod).535ALL other new last many first such next political federal own sev-eral few good?

marks matches with both sen-timent lexicons SUB and SOC.In order to produce the subjective seed adjec-tives for the weakly supervised extraction, we col-lect from the sentiment lexicon that we evaluate then most frequent subjective adjectives according toour corpus.
In order to further improve the qualityof the seed set, we only consider strong subjectiveexpressions from SUB and expressions with the in-tensity strength ?5 from SOC.Table 1 lists the size of the different sentiment lex-icons and the rankings produced by the different ex-traction methods.
Of course, the list of all adjectivesfrom the corpus (ALL) is the largest list2 while PRDis the second largest and GRD the third largest.
Therankings produced by WKS are fairly sparse, in par-ticular the ones induced with the help of SOC; ap-parently there are more frequently occurring strongsubjective adjectives in SUB than there are high in-tensity adjectives in SOC.4.1 Frequent Adjectives vs. FrequentPredicative AdjectivesTable 2 compares the 30 most frequent adjectives(ALL) and predicative adjectives (PRD).
Not onlydoes this table show that the proportion of subjectiveadjectives is much larger among the predicative ad-jectives but we may also gain some insight into whatnon-subjective adjectives are excluded.
Among thehigh frequent adjectives are many quantifiers (many,few and several) and ordinal expressions (first, nextand last).
In principle, most of these expressionsare not subjective.
One may argue that these adjec-tives behave like function words.
Since they occur2It will also contain many words erroneously tagged as ad-jectives, however, this is unlikely to affect our experiments sincewe only focus on the highly ranked (i.e.
most frequent) words.The misclassifications rather concern infrequent words.very frequently, one might exclude some of themby just ignoring the most frequent adjectives.
How-ever, there are also other types of adjectives, espe-cially pertainyms (political, federal, economic, pub-lic, American, foreign, local, military, financial andnational) that appear on this list which could not beexcluded by that heuristic.
We found that these non-subjective content adjectives are present throughoutthe entire ranking and they are fairly frequent (onthe ranking).
On the list of predicative adjectives allthese previous types of adjectives are much less fre-quent.
Many of them only occur on lower ranks (andwe assume that several of them only got on the listdue to parsing errors).4.2 Comparison of the Different ExtractionMethodsTable 3 compares the precision of the different ex-traction methods at different cut-off values.
It is in-teresting to see that for ALL in particular the higherranks are worse than the lower ranks (e.g.
rank1000).
We assume that this is due to the high-frequency adjectives which are similar to functionwords (see Section 4.1).
At all cut-off values, how-ever, this baseline is beaten by every other method,including our proposed method PRD.
The two unsu-pervised methods PRD and GRD perform on a parwith each other.
On SUB, PRD even mostly out-performs GRD.
The precision achieved by WKS isquite good.
However, the coverage of this methodis low.
It would require more seed expressions toincrease it, however, this would also mean consider-ably more manual guidance.Table 3 also shows that the precision of all ex-traction methods largely drops on the lower ranks.However, one should not conclude from that the ex-traction methods proposed only work well for highlyfrequent words.
The drop can be mostly explainedby the fact that the two sentiment lexicons we usefor evaluation are finite (i.e.
SUB: 4396 words/SOC:2827 words (Table 1)), and that neither of these lexi-cons (nor their union) represents the complete set ofall English subjective adjectives.
Both lexicons willhave a bias towards frequently occurring subjectiveexpressions.Inspecting the ranks 3001-3020 produced by PRDas displayed in Table 4, for example, actually revealsthat there are still many more subjective adjectives536Lexicons Extraction MethodsWKS-5 WKS-10 WKS-25 WKS-50SUB SOC ALL PRD GRD SUB SOC SUB SOC SUB SOC SUB SOC4396 2827 212287 20793 7942 292 81 440 131 772 319 1035 385Table 1: Statistics regarding the size (i.e.

marks matches with either of thesentiment lexicons SUB or SOC.than the matches with our sentiment lexicons sug-gest (e.g.
appealable, accomodating, well-meaning,weakest, unsurpassed, unopposed, unobjectionable,unemployable, uncharacteristic or speechless).
Inother words, these are less frequent words; manyof them are actually subjective even though they arenot listed in the sentiment lexicons.
Moreover, irre-spective of the drop in precision on the lower ranks,PRD and GRD still outperform ALL on both senti-ment lexicons (Table 3).
Despite the sparseness ofour two gold standards on the lower ranks, we thushave some indication that PRD and GRD are moreeffective than ALL.The problem of the evaluation of less-frequentwords could not be solved by an extrinsic evaluation,either, e.g.
by using the extracted lists for some textclassification task (at the sentence/document level).The evaluation on contextual classification on cor-pora would also be biased towards high-frequencywords (as the word distribution is typically Zipfian).For instance, on the MPQA-corpus (Wiebe et al2005), i.e.
the standard dataset for (fine-grained)sentiment analysis, there is not a single mention ofthe subjective words appealable, accommodating,unsurpassed, unopposed, unobtrusive or speechless,which were found among the lower ranks 3001-3020.4.3 How Different Are Gradable andPredicative Adjectives?Since in the previous experiments the proportion ofsubjective adjectives was similar among the grad-able adjectives and the predicative adjectives, wemay wonder whether these two extraction methodsproduce the same adjectives.
In principle, the set ofgradable adjectives extracted is much smaller thanthe list of extracted predicative adjectives (see Ta-ble 1).
We found that the gradable adjectives area proper subset of predicative adjectives, which isin line with the observation by (Bolinger, 1972,21) that gradable adjectives (which he calls degreewords) readily occur predicatively whereas non-gradable ones tend not to.However, while gradability implies compatibilitywith predicative use, the reverse is not true.
Ac-cordingly, we found adjectives that are definitely notgradable among the predicative adjectives that aresubjective, for instance endless, insolvent, nonexis-tent, stagnant, unavailable or untrue.
This meansthat with the criterion of predicative adjectives oneis able to extract relevant subjective adjectives thatcannot be caught by the gradability criterion alone,namely complementary adjectives that refer to a sim-ple binary opposition (Cruse, 1986, 198-99).4.4 Intersecting the Different UnsupervisedCriteriaIn this section, we want to find out whether we canincrease the precision by considering intersectionsof the two different unsupervised extraction crite-ria.
(Due to the sparsity of WKS, it does not makesense to include that method in this experiment.)
Inour previous experiments it turned out that as far asprecision is concerned, our new proposed extractioncriterion was similar to the gradability criterion.
If,however, the intersection of these two criteria pro-duces better results, then we have provided somefurther proof of the effectiveness of our proposedcriterion (even though we may sacrifice some exclu-sive subjective adjectives in PRD as pointed out inSection 4.3).
It would mean that this criterion is alsobeneficial in the presence of the gradability criterion.Figure 1 shows the corresponding results.

As this extractionmethod is completely unsupervised, it is preferableto weakly supervised extraction methods since weare not dependent on a manually designed high qual-ity seed set and we obtain a much larger set of ad-jectives.
This extraction method is competitive ifnot slightly better than gradable adjectives.
In ad-dition, combining these two unsupervised methodsby assessing their intersection results mostly in anincrease in precision.AcknowledgementsThis work was performed in the context of the Software-Cluster project EMERGENT.
