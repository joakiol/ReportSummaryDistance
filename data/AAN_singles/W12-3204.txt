Going beyondthese coarse measures of gender participation,we conduct a fine-grained study of genderin the field of Natural Language Processing.We use topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allo-cation) to explore the research topics of menand women in the ACL Anthology Network.We find that women publish more on dialog,discourse, and sentiment, while men publishmore than women in parsing, formal seman-tics, and finite state models.
To conduct ourstudy we labeled the gender of authors in theACL Anthology mostly manually, creating auseful resource for other gender studies.
Fi-nally, our study of historical patterns in fe-male participation shows that the proportionof women authors in computational linguis-tics has been continuously increasing, withapproximately a 50% increase in the threedecades since 1980.1 IntroductionThe gender imbalance in science and engineering isparticularly striking in computer science, where thepercentage of graduate students in computer sciencethat are women seems to have been declining ratherthan increasing recently (Palma, 2001; Beaubouefand Zhang, 2011; Spertus, 1991; Hill et al, 2010;Singh et al, 2007).While many studies have examined enrollmentand career advancement, less attention has beenpaid to gender differences in scientific publications.This paper studies author gender in the Associa-tion for Computational Linguistics Anthology Net-work (AAN) corpus (Radev et al, 2009), (based onthe ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al,2008)) from which we used 13,000 papers by ap-proximately 12,000 distinct authors from 1965 to2008.The AAN corpus disambiguates author names,but does not annotate these names for gender.
Wefirst performed a mostly-manual annotation of thegender of each author (details in Section 2).
Wemake these annotation available as a useful resourcefor other researchers.1We then study a number of properties of the ACLauthors.
We first address surface level questions re-garding the balance of genders in publications.
In2008, women were granted 20.5% of computer sci-ence PhDs (CRA, 2008).
Does this ratio hold alsofor the percentages of papers written by women incomputational linguistics as well?
We explore dif-ferences in publication count between genders, look-ing at total publications and normalized values likepublications per year and trends over time.Going beyond surface level analysis, we then turnto document content.
We utilize Latent Dirichlet Al-location (LDA) topic models (Blei et al, 2003) tostudy the difference in topics that men and womenwrite about.2 Determining GenderThe gender of an author is in general difficult todetermine automatically with extremely high pre-cision.
In many languages, there are gender-differentiated names for men and women that canmake gender-assignment possible based on gen-1http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/gender.shtml33dered name dictionaries.
But the fact that ACLauthors come from many different language back-ground makes this method prone to error.
For exam-ple, while U.S. Census lists of frequently occurringnames by gender (Census, 2012) can resolve a largeproportion of commonly occurring names from au-thors in the United States and Canada, they incor-rectly list the name ?Jan?
as female.
It turns outthat authors in the ACL Anthology who are named?Jan?
are in fact male, since the name is a very com-mon male name in many parts of Europe, and sinceUS female researchers named ?Jan?
often use thefull form of their name rather than the shortening?Jan?
when publishing.
Furthermore, a significantpercentage of ACL authors have Chinese languagenames, which are much less clearly linked with per-sonal names (e.g., Weiwei Sun is female whereasWeiwei Ding is male).We found that Chinese names as well as ambigu-ous names like ?Jan?
were poorly predicted by on-line name gender website algorithms we looked at,leading to a high error rate.
To insure high precision,we therefore instead chose to annotate the authorsin the corpus with a high-precision method; mainlyhand labeling the names but also using some auto-matic help.We used unambiguous name lists for various lan-guages to label a large proportion of the name; forexample we used the subset of given names (outof the 4221 first names reported in the 1990 U.S.Census) that were unambiguous (occurring consis-tently with only one gender in all of our name lists)used morphological gender for languages like Czechor Bulgarian which mark morphological gender onnames, and relied on lists of Indian and Basquenames (from which we had removed any ambigu-ous names).
For all ambiguous names, we next usedour personal cognizance of many of the ACL au-thors, also asking for help from ACL researchersin China, Taiwan, and Singapore (to help label Chi-nese names of researchers they were familiar with)and other researchers for help on the Japanese andKorean names.
Around 1100 names were hand-labeled from personal cognizance or photos of theACL researchers on their web pages.
The combina-tion of name lists and personal cognizance left only2048 names (15% of the original 12,692) still unla-beled.
We then used a baby name website, www.Total First AuthorGender Papers % Papers %Female 6772 33% 4034 27%Male 13454 64% 10813 71%Unknown 702 3% 313 2%Table 1: Number of publications by gender.

The first authored publications columnshows the number of papers for which a given gender isthe first author.gpeters.com/names/, originally designed forreporting the popularity and gender balance of firstnames, to find the gender of 1287 of these 2048names.2 The remaining 761 names remained unla-beled.0 1000 20003000 4000 50006000 7000 80009000Female Male UnknownNumberofAuthorsGenderAuthorship by GenderFigure 1: The total number of authors of a given gender.3 Overall StatisticsWe first discuss some overall gender statistics for theACL Anthology.
Figure 1 shows the number of au-thors of each gender.
Men comprised 8573 of the12692 authors (67.5%) and there were 3359 femaleauthors (26.5%).
We could not confidently deter-mine the gender of 761 out of 12692 (6.0%) of theauthors.
Some of these are due to single letter firstnames or problems with ill-formatted data.Table 1 lists the number of papers for each gen-der.
About twice as many papers had at least one2The gender balance of these 1287 automatically-determined names was 34% female, 66% male, slightlyhigher than the average for the whole corpus.34male author (64%) as had at least one female au-thor (33%).
The statistics for first authorship wereslightly more skewed; women were the first authorof 27% of papers, whereas men first authored 71%.In papers with at least one female author, the first au-thor was a woman 60% of the time, whereas paperswith at least one male author had a male first author80% of the time.
Thus men not only write more pa-pers, but are also more frequently first authors.0 5001000 15002000 25001960  1970  1980  1990  2000  2010PublicationsYearAuthorship by YearFemaleMaleUNKFigure 2: The number of authors of a given gender for agiven year.Figure 2 shows gender statistics over time, givingthe number of authors of a given gender for a givenyear.
An author is considered active for a year if heor she was an author of at least one paper.
The num-ber of both men and women authors increases overthe years, reflecting the growth of computational lin-guistics.Figure 3 shows the percentage of authors of agiven gender over time.
We overlay a linear re-gression of authorship percentage for each gendershowing that the proportion of women is growingover time.
The male best fit line has equation y =?0.3025x + 675.49(R2 = 0.41, p = 1.95 ?
10?5)and the female best fit line is y = 0.3429x ?659.48(R2 = 0.51, p = 1.48?10?5).
Female author-ship percentage grew from 13% in 1980 to 27% in2007, while male authorship percentage decreasedfrom 79% in 1980 to 71% in 2007.
Using the bestfit lines as a more robust estimate, female authorshipgrew from 19.4% to 29.1%, a 50% relative increase.This increase of the percentage of women author-ship is substantial.
Comparable numbers do notseem to exist for computer science in general, butaccording to the CRA Taulbee Surveys of computerscience (CRA, 2008), women were awarded 18% ofthe PhDs in 2002 and 20.5% in 2007.
In computa-tional linguistics in the AAN, women first-authored26% of papers in 2002 and 27% of papers in 2007.Although of course these numbers are not directlycomparable, they at least suggest that women partic-ipate in computational linguistics research at least asmuch as in the general computer science populationand quite possibly significantly more.We next turn attention to how the most prolificauthors of each gender compare.
Figure 4 shows thenumber of papers published by the top 400 authorsof each gender, sorted in decreasing order.
We seethat the most prolific authors are men.There is an important confound in interpreting thenumber of total papers by men and the statistics onprolific authors.
Since, as Figure 3 shows, there wasa smaller proportion of women in the field in theearly days of computational linguistics, and sinceauthors publish more papers the longer they are inthe field, it?s important to control for length of ser-vice.Figure 5 shows the average number of active yearsfor each gender.
An author is considered active inthe years between his or her first and last publicationin the anthology.
Comparing the number of yearsof service for each gender, we find that on averagemen indeed have been in the field longer (t-test, p =10?6).Accounting for this fact, Figure 6 shows the aver-age number of publications per active year.
Womenpublished an average of 1.07 papers per year active,while men published 1.03 papers per active year.This difference is significant (t-test, p = 10?3), sug-gesting that women are in fact slightly more prolificthan men per active year.In the field of Ecology, Sih and Nishikawa (1988)found that men and women published roughly thesame number of papers per year of service.
Theyused a random sample of 100 researchers in the field.In contrast, Symonds et al (2006) found that menpublished more papers per year than women in ecol-ogy and evolutionary biology.
This study also usedrandom sampling, so it is unclear if the differing re-sults are caused by a sampling error or by some othersource.350204060801001980  1990  2000  2010PercentageofAuthorsYearPercentage Authorship by YearFemaleMaleUNKFigure 3: The percentage of authors of a given gender per year.

Our main tool is La-tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a model of the top-ics in a document.
We briefly describe LDA; see(Blei et al, 2003) for more details.
LDA is a genera-tive model of documents, which models documentsas a multinomial mixture of topics, which in turn are0 0.51 1.52 2.53 3.5Female MaleNumberofActiveYearsGenderAverage Number of Active YearsFigure 5: The average number of active years by gendermultinomial distributions over words.
The genera-tive story proceeds as follows: a document first picksthe number of words N it will contain and samples amultinomial topic distribution p(z|d) from a Dirich-let prior.
Then for each word to be generated, it picksa topic z for that word, and then a word from themultinomial distribution p(w|z).Following earlier work like Hall et al (2008), weran LDA (Blei et al, 2003) on the ACL Anthology,3600.511.52Female MaleNumberofPapersGenderAverage Papers Per Year ActiveFigure 6: The average number of papers per active year,where an author is considered active in years between hisor her first and last publication.producing 100 generative topics.
The second authorand another senior expert in the field (Christopher D.Manning) collaboratively assigned labels to each ofthe 100 topics including marking those topics whichwere non-substantive (lists of function words or af-fixes) to be eliminated.
Their consensus labelingeliminated 27 topics, leaving 73 substantive topics.In this study we are interested in how documentswritten by men and women differ.
We are mainly in-terested in Pr(Z|G), the probability of a topic beingwritten about by a given gender, and Pr(Z|Y,G),the probability of a topic being written about by aparticular gender in a given year.
Random variableZ ranges over topics, Y over years, and G over gen-der.
Our topic model gives us Pr(z|d), where d is aparticular document.
For a document d ?
D, let dGbe the gender of the first author, and dY the year itwas written.To compute Pr(z|g), we sum over documentswhose first author is gender g:Pr(z|g) =?
{d?D|dG=g}Pr(z|d) Pr(d|g)=?
{d?D|dG=g}Pr(z|d)|{d ?
D|dG = g}|To compute Pr(z|y, g), we additionally conditionon the year a document was written:Pr(z|y, g) =?
{d?D|dY =y}Pr(z|d) Pr(d|y, g)=?
{d?D|dY =y,dG=g}Pr(z|d)|{d ?
D|dY = y, dG = g}|To determine fields in which one gender publishesmore than another, we compute the odds-ratioPr(z|g = female)(1?
Pr(z|g = female))Pr(z|g = male)(1?
Pr(z|g = male))for each of the 73 topics in our corpus.5 Topic Modeling ResultsUsing the odds-ratio defined above, we computedthe top eight male and female topics.
The topfemale-published topics are speech acts + BDI,prosody, sentiment, dialog, verb subcategorization,summarization, anaphora resolution, and tutoringsystems.
Figure 9 shows the top words for each ofthose topics.
Figure 7 shows how they have evolvedover time.The top male-published topics are categorialgrammar + logic, dependency parsing, algorithmicefficiency, parsing, discriminative sequence models,unification based grammars, probability theory, andformal semantics.
Figure 8 and 10 display these top-ics over time and their associated words.There are interesting possible generalizations inthese topic differences.
At least in the ACL cor-pus, women tend to publish more in speech, in socialand conversational topics, and in lexical semantics.Men tend to publish more in formal mathematicalapproaches and in formal syntax and semantics.Of course the fact that a certain topic is morelinked with one gender doesn?t mean the other gen-der does not publish in this topic.
In particular, dueto the larger number of men in the field, there can benumerically more male-authored papers in a female-published topic.
Instead, what our analysis yieldsare topics that each gender writes more about, whenadjusted by the number of papers published by thatgender in total.Nonetheless, these differences do suggest thatwomen and men in the ACL corpus may, at leastto some extent, exhibit some gender-specific tenden-cies to favor different areas of research.370 0.01 0.020.03 0.04 0.050.06 0.07 0.081980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearSpeech Acts + BDIFemaleMale0 0.005 0.010.015 0.02 0.0250.03 0.035 0.041980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearProsodyFemaleMale0 0.0050.01 0.0150.02 0.0251980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearSentiment AnalysisFemaleMale0 0.005 0.010.015 0.02 0.0250.03 0.035 0.040.045 0.051980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearDialogFemaleMale0 0.0050.01 0.0150.02 0.0250.031980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearLexical Acquisition Of Verb SubcategorizationFemaleMale0 0.0050.01 0.0150.02 0.0250.031980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearSummarizationFemaleMale0 0.005 0.010.015 0.02 0.0250.03 0.035 0.040.0451980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearAnaphora ResolutionFemaleMale0 0.0050.01 0.0150.02 0.0251980  1990  2000  2010P(topic|gender,year)YearTutoring SystemsFemaleMaleFigure 7: Plots of some topics for which P (topic|female) > P (topic|male).

More concretely, we find approxi-mately a 50% increase in the proportion of femaleauthors since 1980.
While women?s smaller num-bers means that they have produced less total pa-pers in the anthology, they have equal (or even veryslightly higher) productivity of papers per year.In topics, we do notice some differing tenden-cies toward particular research topics.
In currentwork, we are examining whether these differencesare shrinking over time, as a visual overview of Fig-ure 7 seems to suggest, which might indicate thatgender balance in topics is a possible outcome, orpossibly that topics first addressed by women arelikely to to be taken up by male researchers.
Ad-ditionally, other applications of topic models to theACL Anthology allow us to study the topics a sin-gle author publishes in over time (Anderson et al,2012).
These techniques would allow us to studyhow gender relates to an author?s topics throughouthis or her career.Our gender labels for ACL authors (availableat http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/gender.shtml) provide an important resourcefor other researchers to expand on the social studyof computational linguistics research.7 AcknowledgmentsThis research was generously supported by the Of-fice of the President at Stanford University and theNational Science Foundation under award 0835614.Thanks to Steven Bethard and David Hall for cre-ating the topic models, Christopher D.
