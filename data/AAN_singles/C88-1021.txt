Anaphora Resolution:A Multi.Strategy ApproachJaime G. CarbonellRalf D. BrownComputer Science Department & Center for Machine TranslationCarnegie-Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 1521315 April 1988Primary topic: discourseSecondary topics: semantics, computational models,natural language interfaces, pragmaticsAbst rac tAnaphora resolution has proven to be a very difficult problem; itrequires the integrated application of syntactic, semantic, andpragmatic knowledge.
This paper examines the hypothesis thatinstead of attempting to construct a monolithic method for resolvinganaphora, the combination of multiple strategies, each exploiting adifferent knowledge source, proves more effective, theoretically andcomputationally.
Cognitive plausibility is established in that humanjudgements of the optimal anaphoric referent accord with those of thestrategy-based method, and human inability to determine a uniquereferent corresponds to the cases where different strategies offerconflicting candidates for the anaphoric referent.1, In t roduct ion :  The  Complex i ty  of  AnaphoraReso lu t ionAnaphora is a pervasive phenomenon in natural languagecommunication, whether it be complex multi-party human discourseor more constrained bilateral human-computer dialog.
Whereas theubiquity of the phenomenon and tire necessity to cope with it in theconstruction of friendly natural anguage interfaces has long beenrecognized \[13, 8, 9, 17, 15\], no truly comprehensive computationalapproaches for anaphora resolution have been proposed.
The RUSparser \[2\], the XCALIBUR system \[7\], and other operational naturallanguage systems implement very rudimentary methods.
And,theoretical work in linguistics is primarily concerned with certaintypes of syntactic intrasentential coreference, rather than pragmaticintersentential anaphora.AnaPhors typically refer back to other constituents in the samesentence, or to constituents in earlier utterances in fire discourse.Syntactic information plays a central role in establishing appropriatereferents for the former case, intrasentential naphora \[17\].
But,semantic and pragmatic nfonnation isabsolutely required in the lattercase, intersentential anaphora \[15, 9\].
This paper addresses theproblem of intersentential anaphora resolution, integrating caseframesemantics \[10, 12, 5\] and more global dialog coherence structures\[11, 15, 14\].
Empirical studies have shown that intersententialanaphora I is far more frequent and more crucial in designinginteractive natural language interfaces 2 \[8\].962.
The  Prob lem:  Semant ics  and  Pragmat ics  DominateFinding the appropriate anaphoric referent has been longrecognized as a difficult problem, requiring lnuch ~emautic andpragmatic lmowledge.
Consider, for instance, the tbllowing two setsof examples:John took the cake from the table and ate it.John took the cake from the table and washed it.Tile robot pushed the box towards the conveyor belt.
But, itgoojSd and dropped it on its way there.Semantic preference constraints (e.g., \[18, 11), if pmp:~rly coded,suffice to resolve the first example.
The pt'eferre'l object ofingestation is an edible substance.
It is a little more difficult tomechanize a process that excludes things such as cakes from beingthe object of washing.
One cannot simply write a "NOT(edibleyrestriction on the object case of the verb "to wash".
Alter ,all,vegetables and fruits are occasionally washed prior to eating them.Peltlaps a combination of typicality judgements with pragmaticknowledge xla'apolating the effects of attempting to drown a cake insink full of water comes into play.
Or, more abstract irffemntialconstraints are appropriate, snch as requiring that the object of washbe unchanged by immersion in water.
Interestingly, Subjects givenonly the "...and washed it" sentence report consistently that theydidn't even consider the cake a reasonable r ferent for "it".In the robot example, there ate four anaphoric referents, countingthe possessive "its" and the locative "there", referring to threedifferent antecedents.
Although subjects report little difficultyascertaining the referent for each anaphor in a consistent manner, itappears that sophisticated semantic~ are required.
Why is the referentfor "it" in "it goofed and dropped..." the robot rather than the box orthe conveyor belt?
One could argue that the box cannot ake action,but what allows a robot to goof and not a conveyor belt?
Is itsomething as subtle as the degree to which the former can beanthropomolphized being greater than the degree to which the lattercan be anthmpomorphized?The difficulty in anaphoric referent specification i  narratives hasbeen argued convincingly by many researchers including Chamiak inhis work on children's tory comprehension \[9\], where substantialpragmatic domain knowledge must be brought to bear, and by one ofthe authors \[4\], where knowledge of goals and personality traits isrequired to resolve difficult referents.
Hence, the hypothesis thatanaphor resolution in its fnll generality is at best a diffictflt problem,and at worst an almost intractable one, is well supported.Nevertheless, somewhat less ambitious endeavors can prove far moretractable, and yet be of major practical Import.
Hayes \[13\] argued forthe notion of limitod-domain anaphora in a natural language interfaceto an electronic mail system.
Webber \[17\] demonstrated thatintrasentential anaphora was more tractable than its intersententialcounterpart, largely through the categorization of syntactic devicesabsent from larger textual or dialog segments.This paper explores an intemrediate position: addressing muchlarger classes of anaphors than those of Hayes \[13\] in a systematicmariner, but stopping short of full generality, which requiresunbounded pragmatic knowledge and inference.
We explore thecentral hypothesis that anaphora resolution may be best accomplishedthrough fire combination of a set of strategies, rather than by a singlemonolithic method.
The apparent complexities lie in the combinationof these multiple strategies to produce syntactically, semantically aridpragmatically sound anaphoric resolutions.
In the multiple xamplesanalyzed, 3 unambiguous resolutions reported by human subjectscorrespond to situations where the applicable strategies concur on thereferont of an anaphor, and disagreement on the con'eet referent bythe human subjects corresponds to situations where the applicablestrategies propose different candidate referents for file anaphor inquestitm.3.
Multiple Resolution StrategiesIn this section we propose a general framework for anaphorresolution ba~d on the integration of multiple knowledge sources:sentential syntax, case-frame semantics, dialog structure, and generalworld knowledge.
The underlying theoretical tenet is:Anaphor resolution is not a monolithic autonomousprocess; it requires access and integration of all theknowledge sources necessary for dialog and textlnterprel'ation.
These linguistic knowledge sources arebrought o bear as constraints or preferences encoded asmultiple resolntion strategies.Each source of knowledge usethl in resolving intersententialanaphnra is presented below, along with corresponding examples, anda statement of the anaphoric resolution strategy.3.1.
Local A naphor ConstraintsCertain anaphot~ carry with them constraints (number, gender,case, etc.)
which must be satisfied by the candidate referents.
Forinstant'e, gender uniquely specifies the anaphor in:John at~d Mary went shopping.
He bought a steak.\[he=John\]Tile strategy here is trivial:Eliminate from consideration all candidate referents thatviolate the local constraints of the anaphor its question.A variant of this strategy has been implemented in RUS and inXCALIBUR.3.2.
Case-role Semantic ConstraintsHere the ease-role semantics impose constraints on what can fillthem.
If they are filled by an anaphor (which specifies few if anysemantic features), the case role constraints must be also satisfied bythe referent of tile anaphor, thus eliminating from consideration allcandidate anaphor referents that violate constraints on the case roleoccupied by the anaphor.
Consider our previous example, where thesemantic onstraints on the object case of "to eat" and "to wash"impose restrictions on the possible case fillem and prove sufficient oselect a unique referent.John took the cake from the table and ate it.
lit:cake\]John took the cake from the table and washed it.
lit=table\]The slrategy here is also fairly simple:Eliminm'e from consideration all candidate referents thatviolate any case-constraint imposed on the anaphor itsquestion~ Prefer those candidates that accord with typicalease fillers, in the absence of hard constraints.XCALIBUR implements this strategy directly though use of its case-frame grammar.
With the I-rule mechanism, it was possible toimplement an ad-hoc variant of this strategy in RUS as well.3.3.
Preconttition/Postcondition ConstraintsUsing real-world knowledge and pragmatics, it is possible to saythat a candidate antecedent cannot be the referent of an anaphorbecause some action occurring betwee n the referent and the anaphorinvalidates the assumption that they denote one and the same objector event.John gave Tom an apple.
He ate the apple.
\[he=Tom\]Here, "he" refers to Tom, as Jolm no longer has the apple.
Thepostcondition on give is that the actor no longer have the object beinggiven, which ,:onfiicts with the precondition on eat that the actor havethe item being eaten, if the actor is assumed to be John.The strategy is simple, but requires a fairly large amount ofknowledge to be useful for a broad range of cases:Eliminate from consideration all candidate referentsassociated with actions whose postconditions violate thepreconditions of the action containing the anaphor.3.4.
Case.role Persistence PreferenceWe observe a pervasive form of "linguistic inertia" that manifestsas a preference to assign the referent of an anaphor to the linguisticentity in the discourse context hat filled the corresponding semanticcase role in an earlier utterance.
This is a generalized form of ease-role parallelism, which has proven crucial in ellipsis resolution\[8, 7, 5\], although in anaphora resolution it is demoted from thestatus of a categorical constraint to that of a preference.Mary gave an apple to Susan.
John also gave her anorange.
\[her=Susan\]Mary gave an apple to Susan.
She also gave John anorange.
\[she=Mary\]The first anaphor relers to Susan, whereas the second anaphor refersto Mary.
Clearly it is not a matter of primacy or recency, as thesentence structures are identical.
Rather it is a case of structuralparallelism.
And, the semantic structnre dominates over the syntacticone.
For instance, in the first example, "Susan" is the object of the"to" prepositional phrase, whereas the corelerent anaphor is in theindirect ol~iect position: two different syntactic roles that map into thesame semantic ase, recipient.
In the second example above, bothsyntactic mad semantic structures coincide, and therefore thepreference is stronger.
Note, moreover, that the subject or direct-object form of the pronoun ("she" vs "her") is not the primary sourceof discriminant knowledge.
For instance, in the example below, onehas only the anaphor "it", but the same referent discrimination occursby semantic ase-role parallelism:The robot gave the dog a bone.
John also gave it somewater, lit=dog\]The robot gave the dog a bone.
It also gave John somewater, lit=robot\]To provide more ammunition in support of semantic case rolepersistence, consider the following final example, with three possiblereferents to the anapher "him".
It is clear that "Peter" is the preferredreferent, once again due to the persistence of the underlying semanticrecipient case.John carried the box of papers from Bill to Peter.He also sent him Mary's books.
\[he=John, him=Peter\]The semantic preference strategy can be stated as follows:Search first for acceptable referents in the antecedentphrase (or phrases) that occur in the same semantic aserole as the attaphor, l f  a match satisfying all constraintsis found, look no further; else search the other case roles.To our knowledge, this preference strategy has been neither proposednor implemented prior to our work on the Universal Parser (reportedbelow), yet it counts for a large number of anaphor resolutions in oursample set.3.5.
Semantic Alignment PreferenceA form of pragmatic "Occam's razor" exists in not postulating extraroles for the same objects in different sentences inthe discourse.
Thispreference is a more gcner~d and looser form of case role inertia,discussed above, in that the we have inmtia of the underlying action.For instance, in the example below, this preference manifests aspreferring all departures to be from the park, and all arrivals m be atthe club:Mary drove from the park to the club.
Peter went here too.\[there=chth\]Mary drove from the park to the chub.
Peter left there too.\[there=park\]The locative anaphor "there" refers to "the club" in the first exampleabove, but refers to "the park" in the second example, yet bothsentences hare the identical syntactic structure and the same basicunderlying semantic case structure.
However, discourse cohesion97prefers to make the sentences coreferential (pragmatically parallel)with respect o the same underlying action (leaving the pink andgoing to the club).
Therefore, the former aligns with the second(destination) part, whereas the latter aligns with the first (source) part.The strategy here is a bit more difficult o state, and certainly has notbeen implemented in any system to date:I f  the clause in which the anaphor is embedded alignswith a previous clause ("aligns" means that it canrepresent the same underlying action, perhaps withd~fferent instantiated case fillers), or with part of aprevious clause, search first for referents of the anaphorin that clause.
I f  there are no allowable re#rents in thesemantically aligned clause, expand the search to otherantecedent clauses; else halt the search.3.6.
Syntactic paral iel ism preferenceAlthough semantic and pragmatic parallelism (case-persistence,and alignment, respectively, in the discussion above) appear todominate over syntactic parallelism, the latter plays an important roleif two clauses are directly contrasted (e.g., in a coordinate structure,or by means of explicit discourse cohesion markers \[14\]).
Considerthe following examples:The girl scout leader paired Mary with Susan, but she hadpaired her with Nancy last time.
\[she=leader, her=Mary\]The girl scout leader paired Mary with Susan, but she hadpaired Nancy with her last time.
\[she=leader, her=Susan\]There is no reason to prefer different referents for the pronoun "her"in each sentence above, other than retaining as much as possible thesurface syntactic order from the first coordinate clause in the secondclause.
The strategy here is summarized asfollows:In coordinated clauses, adjacent sentences or explicitlycontrasted sentences, prefer the anaphoric referent hatpreserves the surface syntactic role from the first clause.3.7.
Syntactic Topicalization PreferenceTopicalized structures are searched first for possible anaphoricreferents.
Consider, for instance, the following pseudo-cleftconstmctions:It was Mary who told Jane to go to New York.
Why did sitedo it?
\[she=Mary\]It was Jane who went to New York at Mary's bidding.
Whydid she do it?
\[she=Jane\]It was Mary who told Peter to go to New York.
Why did hedo it?
\[he=Peter\]It was Peter who went o New York at Mary's bidding.
Whydid he do it?
\[he=Peter\]In the first set of examples, describing essentially the same tcaderlyingaction, the topicalized person becomes the referent of the anaphor"she:" "Mary" in the first sentence, "Jane" in the second.
And, theaction associated with that person become the r~ferent of "it.
"However, to stress that topicalization is a preferential rather thancategorical strategy, consider the second set of examples above.
Theexact same semantic and syntactic structures yield "Peter" both timesas the referent of "lie", because localized constraints o dictate,regardless of who is topiealized.
Thus, it is important to distinguishconstraints from preferences in anaphora resolution.
Thetopicalization strategy may be stated as follows:Search first a syntactically topiealized part of thecandidate antecedent clause (or clauses) for the referentof the anaphor.
I f  an acceptable referent is found, searchno further; else search the rest of the clause(s).This strategy surprisingly enough has not been exploited h~ anysystem to our knowledge, although it is easy to establish syntactictopiealization (indicated by linguistic devices such as fronting, andcleft constructions).
In contrast, he much more complex phenomenonof pragmatic topiealization by dialog focus or actor focus (discussedbelow) was suggested by Sidner \[lS\] We also believe that dialog98l:'oeus can yield a useful preference for anapnmac reference selection,but lacking a computationally-adequate theory for dialog-level focustrackh~g (Sidner's is a partial theory), we could not yet implementsuch a strategy.3.8.
Intersentential Recency PreferenceThus far we have focused on the problem of selecting the bestanaphoric referent among several candidates, all from a singleprevious sentence (or coordinated clause).
When prior contextcontains many sentences, the question aturally ari~s of how far backto search for the anaphoric referent, and how to prioritize that search.At the paragraph (or dialog) level level, we advocate searchingsentences in reverse chronological ordm, applying all the constraintsand preferences to select among possible candidates within eachsentence.
If there are no satisfactory candidates in the previoussentence, then the one before that is considered, and so on.
Althoughwe are investigating more sophisticated tectmiques, these await amore comprehensive (non-linear) theory of discourse structure - andone that is precise nough to permit implementation.4.
I n tegrat ing  the  St rateg iesIn order to apply a diverse set of strategies, uch as those presentedin this paper, one needs to make a distinction between constraints(which cannot be violated), and preferences (which discriminateamong candidates atisfying all constraints).
The latter may beranked in a partial order (as the goals trees in \[4\]), or may be offered avoting scheme where the stronger preferences get more votes, andwhere conflicting preferences of equal voting power indicate trueambiguity.Our resolution method works by applying the constraints first toreduce the number of candidate referents for the anaphor in question.Then, the preferences are applied to each of the remaining candidates.If more than one preference applies, and each Suggests differentcandidate referents for the anaphor in question, 'all of which havepassed the constraint tests, then we consider the anaphor to have atruly ambiguous referent.
Thus, when faced with conflictingknowledge sources of equal strength, we simply reduce the space ofpossible anaphoric referents to those that are accepted by constraintsand indicated as preferred by one or more preferences.
Earlier handsimulations of a slightly different method 4 on 70 examples (includingthose presented earlier in this paper) yielded 49 unique resolutions, 17conflicting possibilities, and 4 anomalous cases.
Human judgementscorrelate very well in terms of identifying the same referent as thatsuggested by the system in the 49 unique cases.
5 Moreover, themajority of the 17 multiple-referent cases were judged ambiguous byour subjects (the rest required complex world knowledge to establisha unique referent).
Therefore, we believe that one can indeed achievehuman-like performance with the multi-strategy method o fdetermining referents to anaphors using different sources of linguisticknowledge in a semi-modular fashion.5.
A Practical ImplementationWe have developed an anaphor esolver using Local Constraints,Case Role Semantic Constraints, Pre/Postcondition Constraints, CaseRole Persistence, Intersentential Recency Preference, and SyntacticTopiealization Preference.
The implementation ccurs in tile contextof the Universal Parser (UP) project \[6, 16\] at tile Center for MachineTranslation at Camegie..Mellon University.
The UP uses a modifiedform of lexical-functional grammar\[3\] unifying symactie andsemantic knowledge sources to produce a complete parse of eachsentence.
The anaphor esolver operates post facto on the set ofinstantiated semantic ase frames and syntactic trees, attempting toresolve anaphors in the parse of the newest sentence using earlierparses (semantic and syntactic) as context o mine for candidatereferents.
We expect he resolver to become an integral part of ourmulti-lingual machine translation effort.Candidate ~'cferents are derived by extracting the noun phrases fromthe most-receipt revious entences that the resolvcr has processed.The number of sentences examined may be changed, allowiug thefuture addition of discourse phenomena to further restrict thesentenees which are examined for candidate referents.The pmfere,Lces u e a voting method to detennine which candidatereferent is most preferred.
Each preference strategy is given anindividual weight, and may vote with less than its fuU weight for less-preferred candidates, such as case role persistence in a referentseveral sentences removed from the anaphor.In addition to ailing out candidates, the case-role and local anaphorconstraints may also cast votes tot those allowable candidates whichare most clo,~ely matched to the anaphor or con'espond to typicalfillers.
In elf,',ct, fllese strategies indicate a preference in the absenceof hard conso'aints.
For ex~unple, ti~e gender constraint would prefera candidate reference of female gender over one of indeterminategender when resolving an auaphor of female gender, while at thesame time eliminating all candidates of male gender.After applying the preferences, the most preferred candidatereferent is unified with the reference to restrict he range of possiblevalues as mu~:h as possible.
For example, if she is determined to referto doctor, all future anaphorie references to the doctor will berequired to have female or unknown gender.
However, if multiplecandidates have received nearly the same number of votes, theanaphor is coasidered to be anthiguous.Ttle anaphor resolver i~ able to resolve partially-specified definitenoun phrases with an antecedent oun phrase.
To do so, along withthe other lo(-al constraints, the head nouns ,'uld the remaining slots inthe noun ph~a.~c are checked for agreement with the reference.
Thehead noun ol the candidate must be the samc as, or an instance of, thehead noun o(" the reference.
For the remaining slots, it suffices forcorresponding slots to be uniliable with each other or missing fromeither the d~,,finite noun phrase or the candidate referent.
Unlikeanaphors, which must have a suitable referent, it is not considered anerror if there are no referents which pass all constraints.
We believethat the ability to resolve definite noun phrases with basically thesaute approach as anaphors is an indication of the generality of ourstrategies anal their implementation exploiting semantic and syntacticconstraint ut~ification methods.The curt'cut test suite consists of ten examples, totalling 3l,sentences (:outaining 27 anaphors and three definite noun phraseswith prior reii~rents.
6 The anaphor resolver correctly resolves "all butfour of the anapho~s, ,'mr determines the correct referent for all of thedefinite noun ptu'ases; In two of tbe four problematic ases, theanaphor is an it referring to an action only indirectly mentioned,which is beyond the scope of the resolver.
Tile remaining twoanaphors are in the exampleJohn carried the box from Bill to Peter.
He also sent himMacy's books.Here, him remains an~biguous, and he also remains ambiguousbetween John and Bill (with the current voting scheme, John ispreferred over Bill).The follo,~eing rtm of the anaphor rcsolver (edited to save space)illustrates everal of the strategies.
Each candidate referent is taggedwith a number indicating how many votes it has received so far.
Theintersentential recency preference is applied at the same time that thecandidates a~e collected and tagged because of its computationalefficiency; lttus, the initial list of candidates already includes the votesfrom intersentential recency.
The ease-role persistence preference isapplied between pre/postcenditlon constraints and local constraints,because removal of eliminated candidates (in this implementation)also removes tim information on which previous entence acandidateoriginates from.
Then, case-role constraints are applied, and ifmultiple candidates remain, the rem~fining preferences (currently onlysyntactic topicalizatio10 are applied.
