The JDMWEis characterized by a large notational, syntactic,and semantic diversity of contained expressionsas well as a detailed description of theirsyntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities.The dictionary contains about 104,000expressions, potentially 750,000 expressions.This paper shows that the JDMWE?s validitycan be supported by comparing the dictionarywith a large-scale Japanese N-gram frequencydataset, namely the LDC2009T08, generated byGoogle Inc. (Kudo et al 2009).1 IntroductionLinguistically idiosyncratic multiword expressionsoccur in authentic sentences with an unexpectedlyhigh frequency.
Since (Sag et al 2002), we havebecome aware that a proper solution ofidiosyncratic multiword expressions (MWEs) isone of the most difficult and intriguing problems inNLP.
In principle, the nature of the idiosyncrasy ofMWEs is twofold: one is idiomaticity, i.e., non-compositionality of meaning; the other is thestrong probabilistic affinity between componentwords.
Many attempts have been made to extractthese expressions from corpora, mainly usingautomated methods that exploit statistical means.However, to our knowledge, no reliable, extensivesolution has yet been made available, presumablybecause of the difficulty of extracting correctlywithout any human insight.
Recognizing thecrucial importance of such expressions, one of theauthors of the current paper began in the 1970s toconstruct a Japanese electronic dictionary withcomprehensive inclusion of idioms, idiom-likeexpressions, and probabilistically idiosyncraticexpressions for general use.
In this paper, we beginwith an overview of the JDMWE (JapaneseDictionary of Multi-Word Expressions).
It hasapproximately 104,000 dictionary entries andcovers potentially at least 750,000 expressions.The most important features of the JDMWE are:1.
A large notational, syntactic, and semanticdiversity of contained expressions2.
A detailed description of syntactic function andstructure for each entry expression3.
An indication of the syntactic flexibility of entryexpressions (i.e., possibility of internalmodification of constituent words) of entryexpressions.In section 2, we outline the main features of thepresent study, first presenting a brief summary ofsignificant previous work on this topic.
In section 3,we propose and describe the criteria for selectingMWEs and introduce a number of classes ofmultiword expressions.
In section 4, we outline theformat and contents of the JDMWE, discussing theinformation on notational variants, syntacticfunctions, syntactic structures, and the syntacticflexibility of MWEs.
In section 5, we describe andexplain the contextual conditions stipulated in theJDMWE.
In section 6, we illustrate someimportant statistical properties of the JDMWE bycomparing the dictionary with a large-scaleJapanese N-gram frequency dataset, theLDC2009T08, generated by Google Inc. (Kudo etal.
2009).
The paper ends with concluding remarksin section 7.1612 Related WorkGross (1986) analyzed French compound adverbsand compound verbs.
According to his estimate,the lexical stock of such words in French would berespectively 3.3 and 1.7 times greater than that ofsingle-word adverbs and single-word verbs.Jackendoff (1997) notes that an English speaker?slexicon would contain as many MWEs as singlewords.
Sag et al (2002) pointed out that 41% ofthe entries of WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum 1999) aremultiword; and Uchiyama et al (2003) reportedthat 44% of Japanese verbs are VV-typecompounds.
These and other similar observationsunderscore the great need for a well-designed,extensive MWE lexicon for practical naturallanguage processing.In the past, attempts have been made to producean MWE dictionary.
Examples include thefollowing: Gross (1986) reported on a dictionary ofFrench verbal MWEs with description of 22syntactic structures; Kuiper et al (2003)constructed a database of 13,000 English idiomstagged with syntactic structures; Villavicencio(2004) attempted to compile lexicons of Englishidioms and verb-particle constructions (VPCs) byaugmenting existing single-word dictionaries withspecific tables; Baptista et al (2004) reported on adictionary of 3,500 Portuguese verbal MWEs withten syntactic structures; Fellbaum et al (2006)reported corpus-based studies in developingGerman verb phrase idiom resources; and recently,Laporte et al (2008) have reported on a dictionaryof 6,800 French adverbial MWEs annotated with15 syntactic structures.Our JDMWE approach differs from thesestudies in that it can treat more comprehensivetypes of MWEs.
Our system can handle almost alltypes of MWEs except compositional compounds,named entities, acronyms, blends, politenessexpressions, and functional expressions; in contrast,the types of MWEs that most of the other studiescan deal with are limited to verb-object idioms,VPCs, verbal MWEs, support-verb constructions(SVCs) and so forth.Many attempts have been made to extractMWEs automatically using statistical corpus-basedmethods.
For example, Pantel et al (2001) soughtto extract Chinese compounds using mutualinformation and the log-likelihood measure.
Fazlyet al (2006) attempted to extract English verb-object type idioms by recognizing their structuralfixedness in terms of mutual information andrelative entropy.
Bannard (2007) tried to extractEnglish syntactically fixed verb-nouncombinations using pointwise mutual information,and so on.In spite of these and many similar efforts, it isstill difficult to adequately extract MWEs fromcorpora using a statistical approach, becauseregarding the types of multiword expressions,realistically speaking, the corpus-wide distributioncan be far from exhaustive.
Paradoxically, tocompile an MWE lexicon we need a reliablestandard MWE lexicon, as it is impossible toevaluate the automatic extraction by recall ratewithout such a reference.
The conventional idiomdictionaries published for human readers have beenoccasionally used for the evaluation of automaticextraction methods in some past studies.
However,no conventional Japanese dictionary of idiomswould suffice for an MWE lexicon for the practicalNLP because they lack entries related to thediverse MWE objects we frequently encounter incommon textual materials, such as quasi-idioms,quasi-clich?s, metaphoric fixed or partly fixedexpressions.
In addition, they provide nosystematic information on the notational variants,syntactic functions, or syntactic structures of theentry expressions.
The JDMWE is intended tocircumvent these problems.In past Japanese MWE studies, Shudo et al(1980) compiled a lexicon of 3,500 functionalmultiword expressions and used the lexicon for amorphological analysis of Japanese.
Koyama et al(1998) made a seven-point increase in theprecision rate of kana-to-kanji conversion for acommercial Japanese word processor by using aprototype of the JDMWE with 65,000 MWEs.Baldwin et al (2003) discussed the treatment ofJapanese MWEs in the framework of Sag et al(2002).
Shudo et al (2004) pointed out theimportance of the auxiliary-verbal MWEs and theirnon-propositional meanings (i.e., modality in ageneralized sense).
Hashimoto et al (2009)studied a disambiguation method of semanticallyambiguous idioms using 146 basic idioms.3 MWEs Selected for the JDMWEThe human deliberate judgment is indispensablefor the correct, extensive extraction of MWEs.
In162view of this, we have manually extractedmultiword expressions that have definite syntactic,semantic, or communicative functions and arelinguistically idiosyncratic from a variety ofpublications, such as newspaper articles, journals,magazines, novels, and dictionaries.
In principle,the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: first, thesemantic non-compositionality (i.e., idiomaticity);second, the strong probabilistic affinity betweencomponent words.
Here we have treated themdifferently.The number of words included in a MWE rangesfrom two to eighteen.

The evaluation of semanticrelevance of MWEs was carried out by humanjudges entirely.
It is just too difficult to judge thesemantic relevance automatically and correctly.Table 1 shows a number of MWEs of this type.13.2 Probabilistically Idiosyncratic MWEsAn MWE must form a linguistic unit of its own.This and the following transition probabilitycondition constitute another criterion that we adoptto define what an MWE is.
Formally, a word stringw1w2?wi?wn (2?n?18) is an MWE if it has adefinite syntactic, semantic, or communicativefunction of its own, and if its forward or backwardtransition probability pf(wi+1|w1?wi) or pb(wi|wi+1?wn), respectively is judged to be in the relativelyhigh range for some i.
With this definition, forexample, ?-?-??
te-wo-komaneku ?fold arms?is selected as an MWE because it is a well-formedverb phrase and pb(?

-?? )
is judgedempirically to be very high.
No generalprobabilistic threshold value can be fixed a prioribecause the value is expression-dependent.Although the probabilistic judgment wasperformed, for each expression in turn, on the basisof the developer?s empirical language model, theresulting dataset is consistent with this criterion on1 These classes are not necessarily disjoint.163the whole as shown in section 6.1.

Theseare illustrated in Figure 2.Figure 2: Approximate constituent ratio of non-compositional MWEs and probabilistically boundMWEsFigure 3: Example JDMWE entry2 These classes are not necessarily disjoint.4 Contents of the JDMWEThe JDMWE has approximately 104,000 entries,one for each MWE, composed of six fields, namely,Field-H, -N, -F, -S, -Cf, and -Cb.
The dictionaryentry form of an MWE is stated in Field-H in theform of a non-segmented hira-kana (phoneticcharacter) string.
An example is given in Figure 3.4.1 Notational Information (Field-N)Japanese has three notational options: hira-kana,kata-kana, and kanji.
The two kanas arephonological syllabaries.
Kanji are originallyChinese idiographic characters.
As we have manykanji characters that are both homophonic andsynonymous, sentences can contain kanjireplaceable by others.
In addition, the inflectionalsuffix of some verbs can be absent in somecontexts.
The JDMWE has flexible conventions tocope with these characteristics.
It uses brackets toindicate an optional word (or a series ofinterchangeable words marked off by the slash ?/?
)in the Field-N description.
Therefore, the entrywhose Field-H (the first field) is??????
ki-no-ii-yatu (lit.
?a guy who has a good spirit?
)?good-natured guy?, can have (?/?)-?-(?/?/?/?)?-(??/?/??)
in its Field-N.
The dash?-?
is used as a word boundary indicator.
Thisexample can stand for twenty-four combinatorialvariants, i.e., ?????
?,?, ?????,?,?????
?.If fully expanded with this information, theJDMWE?s total number of MWEs can exceed750,000.4.2 Functional Information (Field-F)Linguistic functions of MWEs can be simplyclassified by means of codes, as shown in Tables 3and 4.

?Table 4: Communicative Functions and Examples4.3 Structural Information (Field-S)4.3.1   Dependency StructureThe dependency structure of an MWE is given inField-S by a phrase marker bracketing themodifier-head pairs, using POS symbols forconceptual words.3 For example, an idiom ???-?
- ?
makka-na-uso (lit.
?crimson lie?
)?downright lie?
is given a marker [[K00 na] N].This description represents the structure shown inFigure 4, where K00 and N are POS symbolsdenoting an adjective-verb stem and a noun,respectively.3 The intra-sentential dependency relation in Japanese isunilateral, i.e., the left modifier depends on the right head.The JDMWE contains 49,000 verbal entries,making this the largest functional class in theJDMWE.
For these verbal entries, more than 90patterns are actually used as structural descriptorsin Field-S.
This fact can indicate the broadness ofthe structural spectrum of Japanese verbal MWEs.Some examples are shown in Table 5.Figure 4: Example of dependency structure givenin Field-Sexample of structuralpattern of verbal MWEexample of MWE[[N wo] V30]?-?-???

Thisinformation is described in Field-S by bracketingwith ?<?
and ?>?, and the coordinated parts by ?
(?and ?)?.
The coordinative phrase specificationusually requires that the conjuncts must be parallelwith respect to the syntactic function of theconstituents appearing in the bracketed description.For example, an expression ?-?-?-?-??-?-?-??
ato-ha-no-to-nare-yama-to-nare (lit.
?therest might become either a field or a mountain?
)?what will be, will be?, has an internal coordinatestructure.
Thus, its Field-S is [[N ha]<([[N to]V60])([[N to] V60])>].
This description representsthe structure shown in Figure 5, where V60 denotesan imperative form of the verb.Figure 5: Example of the coordinate structureshown by ?<?
and ?>?
in Field-S4.3.3   Non-phrasal StructureApproximately 250 MWEs in the JDMWE aresyntactically ill-formed in the sense of context-freegrammar but still form a syntactic unit on theirown.
For example, ???
-??
-??
-?
?yurikago-kara-hakaba-made ?from the cradle tothe grave?
is an adjunct of two postpositionalphrases but is often used as a state-describing nounas in ???-??-??-??-?-??
yurikago-kara-hakaba-made-no-hoshou (lit.
security of fromcradle to grave) ?security from the cradle to thegrave?.
Thus Field-F and Field-S have a functionalcode Nk and a description [[N kara][[N made] $]],respectively.
The symbol ?$?
denotes a nullconstituent occupying the position of the governoron which this MWE depends.
This structure isshown in Figure 6.Figure 6: Example of a non-phrasal expressionwith a null constituent marked with ?$?
in Field-SThe total number of structural types specified inField-S is nearly 6,000.
This indicates thatJapanese MWEs present a wide structural variety.4.3.4   Internal ModifiabilitySome MWEs are not fixed-length word strings, butallow the occurrence of phrasal modifiersinternally.
In our system, this aspect is captured byprefixing a modifiable element of the structuraldescription stated in the Field-S with an asterisk?*?.
An adverbial MWE ?-?-??-?-?-?
ue-ni-nobe-ta-you-ni ?as I explained above?
is onesuch MWE and thus has a description [[[[[N ni]*V23] ta] N] ni] in Field-S, meaning that the thirdelement V23 is a verb that can be modifiedinternally by adverb phrases.
Since the asteriskdesignates such optional phrasal modification, oursystem allows   a   derivative   expression   like   ??
-?-?-?-???-??-?-?-?
riyuu-wo-ue-ni-kuwasiku-nobe-ta-you-ni ?as I explained indetail the reason above?, which contains twoadditional, internal modifiers.
The structure isshown in Figure 7.4Figure 7: Example of internal modifiability markedby ?*?
in Field-S4 The positions to be taken by an internal modifier can beeasily decided by the structural description given in Field-Salong with the nest structure requirement.166Roughly speaking, 30,000 MWEs in the JDMWEhave no asterisk in their Field-S. Our rigidexamination reveals that internal modification isnot allowed for them.5 Contextual Condition (Field-Cf , Cb)Approximately 6,700 MWEs need to be classifieddifferently because they require particular forwardcontexts, i.e., they require co-occurrence of aparticular syntactic phrase in the context thatimmediately precedes them.
For example, ?-?-??
kao-wo-suru (lit.
?do face?)
which is asupport-verb construction, cannot occur without animmediately preceding adnominal modifier, e.g.,the adjective ???
kanasii  ?sad?, yielding ???-?-?-??
kanasii-kao-wo-suru (lit.
?do sadface?)
?make a sad face?.
This adnominal modifierco-occurrence requirement is stipulated in Field-Cfby a code <adnom.
modifier>.
There are about 30of these forward contextual requirements.Similarly, backward contextual requirements, ofwhich there are about 70, are stated in Field-Cb.Approximately 300 MWEs require particularbackward contexts.6 Statistical PropertiesWithout a rule system of semantic composition, itis difficult to evaluate the validity of the JDMWEconcerning idiomaticity.
However, we can confirmthat 3,600 Japanese standard idioms that Sato(2007) listed from five Japanese idiom dictionariespublished for human readers are included in theJDMWE as a proper subset.
In addition, theJDMWE contains the information about theirsyntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities.6.1 Comparison with Web N-gramFrequency DataWe examined the statistical properties of theJDMWE using the Japanese Web N-gram, version1: LDC2009T08, which is a word N-gram (1?N?7)frequency dataset generated from 2 ?
1010sentences in a Japanese Web corpus, supplied byGoogle Inc. (Kudo et al 2009).
We will refer tothis (or the Web corpus examined) subsequently asGND.
We will refer to trigram w1w2w3 as an NpV-trigram only when w1 and w3 are restricted to anoun and a verb (end form), respectively, and w2 isone of the following case-particles: accusative ?wo, subjective?
ga, or dative?
ni.5 We write thenumber of occurrences of an expression x, countedin the GND, as C(x).First, we obtain from the GND sets G, T, D, B,and Ri?s defined below, using a Japanese worddictionary IPADIC (Asahara et al 2003):G={w1w2w3| w1w2w3 ?
GND, w1w2w3 is anNpV-trigram.
}T={w1w2w3| w1w2w3 ?
JDMWE, w1w2w3  is anNpV-trigram.
}D={w1w2|?w3, w1w2w3?
G}B={w1w2|?w3, w1w2w3?
T}Ri={w1w2w3| w1w2w3?
T, C(w1w2w3) is the i-thlargest among C(w1w2v)?s for all w1w2v ?
G}.We then found the following data:?|B|=10,548?|D|=110,822?
|R1|=4,983, |R2|=1,495, |R3|=786, |R4|=433,  ?From these, we realize, for example, that 47.2%=(|R1|/|B|)?100 of trigrams in T have verbs thatoccur most frequently in the GND, succeeding theindividual bigrams.
An example of such a trigramis?????-?-???
akushon-wo-okosu  (lit.
?raise action?)
?take action?.
Similarly, 14.0%=(|R2|/|B|)?100 have the second most frequent verbs,7.5% have the third most frequent verbs, and so on.Figure 8(a) illustrates the results.
From this, we canassume that the higher probability pf(w3|w1w2) atrigram w1w2w3 has, the more likely w3 is chosenfor each w1w2 in the JDMWE.
This is consistentwith what we wrote in section 3.2.
Figure 8(b) isthe accumulative substitute of Figure 8(a).Extrapolating Figure 8(b) suggests that 10% ofNpV-trigrams in the JDMWE do not occur in theGND.
This implies that the size, i.e., 2?1010sentences of the Web corpus used by the GND isnot sufficiently large to allow MWE extraction.
65 The NpV-trigrams represent the typical forms of shortestJapanese sentences, corresponding roughly to subject-verb,verb-object/direct, and verb-object/indirect constructions inEnglish.6 Otherwise, the frequency cut-off point of 20 adopted in GNDis too high.167(a)(b)01020304050607080901001 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20RankConstituentRatio(%)Figure 8 (a): Constituent ratio (|Ri|/|B|)?100 forrank i of probability pf(w3|w1w2); (b):Accumulative variant of (a) for rank i ofprobability pf(w3|w1w2)Second, we calculate the (normalized) entropyHf(w3|w1w2) for each w1w2 ?
D defined below,where the probability pf(w3|w1w2) is estimated byC(w1w2w3)/C(w1w2).
This provides a measure ofthe flatness of the pf(w3|w1w2) distributioncanceling out the influence of the number N ofverb types w3?s.Hf(w3|w1w2)= ?
(?3wpf(w3|w1w2) log pf(w3|w1w2)) / log NAfter arranging 110,822 bigrams in D in ascendingorder of Hf(w3|w1w2), we divided them into 20intervals A1, A2, ?
, A20 each with an equal numberof bigrams (5,542).
We then examined how manybigrams in B were included in each interval.Figures 9(a) and (b) plot the resulting constituentratio of the bigrams in B and the mean value ofHf(w3|w1w2)?s in each interval, respectively.
Wefound, for example, that 1,262 out of 5,542bigrams are in B for the first interval, i.e., theconstituent ratio is 22.8%=(1,262/5,542)?
100.Similarly, we obtain 22.5%=(1,248/5,542)?100for the second interval, 20.5%=(1,136/5,542)?100for the third, and so on.
From this, we realize themacroscopic tendency that the larger the entropyHf(w3|w1w2), or equivalently the perplexity of thesucceeding verb w3, a bigram w1w2 has, the lesslikely it is adopted as a prefix of a trigram in T.Taking the results in Figure 8 and Figure 9together, we can presume that not only frequentlybut also exclusively occurring verbs would be thepreferred choice in T.(a)(b)05101520251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20IntervalConstituentRatio(%)00.20.40.60.81AverageEntropyFigure 9 (a): Constituent ratio of the bigrams in Bamong bigrams in D in interval k (1?k?20); (b):Mean value of entropies Hf(w3|w1w2)?s in theinterval k (1?k?20)This suggests the general feasibility of theJDMWE, for its relative compactness, ineffectively disambiguating the syntactic structuresof input word strings.The above investigations were carried out on theforward conditional probabilities for restrictedtypes of MWEs.
However, the results imply ageneral validity of the JDMWE since the samecriteria for selection were applied to all kinds ofmultiword expressions.6.2 Occurrences in NewspapersWe examined 2,500 randomly selected sentencesin Nikkei newspaper articles (published in 2009) todetermine how many MWE tokens of the JDMWEoccur in them.
We found that in 100 sentences anaverage of 74 tokens of our MWEs were used.
Thissuggests a large lexical coverage of the JDMWE.7 Concluding RemarksThe JDMWE is a slotted tree bank foridiosyncratic multiword expressions, annotatedwith detailed notational, syntactic information.The idea underlying the JDMWE is that thevolume and meticulousness of the lexical resourcecrucially affects the outcome of the rule-oriented,large-scale NLP.
In view of this, the JDMWE wasdesigned to encompass the wide range of linguisticobjects related to Japanese MWEs, by placingimportance on the recall rate in the selection of the168candidate expressions.
7  The statistical propertiesclarified in this paper imply the general feasibilityof the JDMWE at least in the probabilistic respect.Possible fields of application of the JDMWEinclude, for example:?Phrase-based machine translation?Phrase-based speech recognition?Phrase-based kana-to-kanji conversion?Search engine for Japanese corpus?Paraphrasing system?Japanese dialoguer?Japanese language education systemAnother aspect of the JDMWE is that it wouldprovide linguists with lexicological data.
Forexample, the usage of Japanese onomatopoeicadverbs, which are mostly bound probabilisticallyto specific verbs or adjectives, is extensivelycatalogued in the JDMWE.The first version of the JDMWE will be releasedafter proofreading.8 If possible, we would like toadd further information to each MWE onmorphological variants, passivization,relativization, decomposability, paraphrasing, andsemantic disambiguation for future versions.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the late ProfessorsToshihiko Kurihara and Sho Yoshida, whoinspired our current research in the 1970s.
