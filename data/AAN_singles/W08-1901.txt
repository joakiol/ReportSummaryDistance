This paper conducts some initialcomparisons of the lexical relationshipsobserved within Japanese collocation da-ta extracted from a large corpus using theJapanese language version of the SketchEngine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi?
et al,2008) and the relationships found withinJapanese word association sets takenfrom the large-scale Japanese Word As-sociation Database (JWAD) under ongo-ing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007).The comparison results indicate thatwhile some relationships are common toboth linguistic resources, many lexicalrelationships are only observed in one re-source.
These findings suggest that bothresources are necessary in order to moreadequately cover the diverse range oflexical relationships.
Finally, the paperreflects briefly on the implementation ofassociation-based word-search strategiesinto electronic dictionaries proposed byZock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006).1 IntroductionLarge-scale corpora and various corpus querytools have long been recognized as extremelyimportant language resources.

Somerights reserved.corpora and corpus query tools has been particu-larly significant in the area of compiling and de-veloping lexicographic materials (Kilgarriff andRundell, 2002) and in the area of creating variouskinds of lexical resources, such as WordNet(Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Atkins et al,2003; Fillmore et al, 2003).In contrast, although the significance of data-bases of free word association norms have longbeen recognized within psychology in providinginsights into higher cognitive processes (Cramer,1968; Deese, 1965; Nelson et al, 1998; Steyversand Tenenbaum, 2005), their value as a languageresource has been largely overlooked.
However,as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) point out,databases of word association norms represent anextremely useful supplement to the range of tra-ditional language resources, such as large-scalecorpora, thesauri, and dictionaries, and can po-tentially contribute greatly to the development ofmore sophisticated linguistic resources.This paper seeks to demonstrate the potentialvalue of word association databases as languageresources.
Specifically, we conduct some initialcomparisons of the lexical relationships observedwithin Japanese collocation data, as extractedfrom a large corpus with the Japanese languageversion of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool(Srdanovi?
et al, 2008), with those found withinJapanese word association sets, which werecreated through the ongoing construction of thelarge-scale Japanese Word Association Database(JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007).
Interesting similar-ities and differences between the two languageresources in terms of captured lexical relation-ships affirm the value of word association data-bases as rich linguistic resources.
In concluding,we speculate briefly on how the wider range oflexical relationships identifiable through thecombination of collocation data and word associ-1ation databases could be utilized in organizinglexical entries within electronic dictionaries inways that are cognitively salient.
While we fullyacknowledge that the challenges involved areformidable ones (Zock, 2006), the principled in-corporation of word association knowledge with-in electronic dictionaries could greatly facilitatethe development of more flexible and user-friendly navigation and search strategies (Zockand Bilac, 2004).2 Basic Concepts: Word Sketches andWord Association NormsThis section briefly provides some backgroundinformation about SkE, which is the corpusquery tool used in this study to extract and dis-play word collocation data, and about word asso-ciation norms as gathered through psychologicalexperimentation.2.1 Sketch Engine (SkE): Word Sketchesand Thesaurus ToolsSketch Engine (SkE) (Kilgarriff et al 2004) is aweb-based corpus query tool that supports anumber of functions.
These include fast concor-dancing, grammatical processing, ?word sketch-ing?
(one-page summaries of a word?s grammati-cal and collocation behavior), a distributionalthesaurus, and robot use.
SkE has been applied toa number of languages.
In this study, we utilizethe Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions forthe Japanese language.
As both tools process rawcollocation data by organizing words accordingto grammatical and lexical relationships, they areparticularly suited to the conducted comparisonswith the word association data.Word Sketches (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001)present the most frequent and statistically-salientcollocations and grammatical relations for a giv-en word.
These relations are derived as the re-sults of grammatical analysis (a gramrel file) thatemploys regular expressions over PoS-tags.The distributional thesaurus groups togetherwords that occur in similar contexts and havecommon collocation words.
Estimations of se-mantic similarity are based on ?shared triples?.For example, <read a book> and <read a maga-zine> share the same triple pattern of <read a ?>,and because ?book?
and ?magazine?
exhibit highsalience for the triple, they are both assumed tobelong to the same thesaurus category.
This ap-proach is similar to conventional techniques forautomatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998).2.2 Word Association NormsIn contrast to the Word Sketch collocation andthesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basicinput language resource, databases of word asso-ciation norms are the results of psychologicalexperiments.
The free word association task typi-cally asks the respondent to respond with the firstsemantically-related word that comes to mind onpresentation of a stimulus word.The collection of word association normativedata can be traced back to the seminal study byKent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered wordassociation responses for a list of 100 stimuluswords.
However, despite the insightful remarksof Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that wordassociations closely mirror the structured patternsof relations that exist among concepts?claimsthat undoubtedly warrant further investigation?there are, unfortunately, still relatively few large-scale databases of word association norms.
Thenotable exceptions for the English language in-clude the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus(EAT) (Kiss et al, 1973), which consists of ap-proximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus listof 8,400 words, and the University of South Flor-ida Word Association, Rhyme, and Word Frag-ment Norms compiled by Nelson et al (1998),consisting of nearly three-quarters of a millionresponses to 5,019 stimulus words.
Another da-tabase deserving mention is the Russian Associa-tion Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al(1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (citedin Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004).3 Japanese Language ResourcesThis section introduces the Japanese languageresources utilized in this study: namely, the Jap-anese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi?et al, 2008) and the Japanese Word AssociationDatabase (Joyce, 2005, 2007).3.1 Japanese Word Sketches and ThesaurusThe Japanese version of SkE is based on JpWaC(Erjavec et al, 2007; Srdanovi?
et al, 2008),which is a 400-million word Japanese web cor-pus that has been morphologically analyzed andPOS-tagged with the ChaSen tool(http://chasen.naist.jp/).
The Word Sketches arebased on Japanese grammatical analysis results(gramrel file), where 22 grammatical relationsare defined based on ChaSen PoS tags and to-kens (Srdanovi?
et al2008).
Figure 1 presents2parts of word sketches for the noun fuyu (?
win-ter), showing adjective modifications and twoverb relations involving the particles of wa (?topic marker) and ni (?
time marker), respec-tively.Figure 1.
Parts of the Word Sketch results for thenoun fuyu (?
winter).3.2 Japanese Word Association DatabaseTo an even greater extent than for the Englishlanguage, there has been a serious lack of wordassociation norms for the Japanese language.While Umemoto?s (1969) survey collected asso-ciations from 1,000 university students, the li-mited set of just 210 words merely underscoresthe deficient.
More recently, Okamoto and Ishi-zaki (2001) compiled an Associative ConceptDictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 wordassociation responses provided by 10 respon-dents for 1,656 nouns.
However, it should benoted that the ACD is not strictly free associationdata because response category was specified aspart of the task.Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005,2007), the Japanese Word Association Database(JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a verylarge-scale database of free word associationnorms for the Japanese language in terms of boththe number of stimulus items and the numbers ofassociation responses collected.
The presentJWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japa-nese kanji and words.
The currently availableJWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of104,800 free word association responses col-lected through a paper questionnaire survey witha sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50respondents.
The association sets compared withwork sketch profiles in the subsequent sectionsare from JWAD-V1.4 Conducted ComparisonsThis section presents the results of our initialcomparison for the lexical relationships observedwithin the Japanese collocation data with those inthe Japanese word association sets.
The compari-sons focused on approximately 350 word associ-ation responses constituting the association setsfor the two verbs of kizuku (???
to notice)and sagasu (??
to search for), the adjective ofomoshiroi (???
interesting), and the threenouns of jitensha (???
bicycle), natsu (?summer), and yama (?
mountain), as examplesof basic Japanese vocabulary.
Taking into ac-count the considerable degree of orthographicvariation present with the Japanese writing sys-tem, all possible orthographic variations weresearched for in the SkE, such as kizuku (???/???)
and omoshiroi (???/?????
).4.1 Word Sketches and Thesaurus VersusWord Association NormsThe Japanese SkE employs a large-scale Japa-nese corpus and detailed grammatical analysisbased on ChaSen POS tags.
Accordingly, nu-merous lexical relationships are identified in theword sketches and thesaurus results.
For example,kizuku appears 12,134 times in the corpus in ap-proximately 200 collocation examples in total,which are grouped under 12 different collocationand grammatical relations and sorted accordingto the statistical salience of the relation?s fre-quency within the corpus (note that searcheswere conducted with the default setting of onlyincluding collocations with frequencies of five ormore).
The thesaurus function also yields numer-ous results, typically displaying around 60 salientrelations that are clustered into five semanticgroups.
In contrast, while JWAD-V1 is quitelarge-scale for a word association databases, it isnaturally far smaller than the Japanese SkE cor-pus.
As already noted, it consists of word associ-ation collected from about 50 respondents (al-though there are 100 respondents in the case ofkizuku), and where some responses would ob-viously be provided by multiple respondents.Comparisons of the SkE results with the setsof word association responses revealed that thereis considerable overlap in the range of lexicalrelationships observed in the two linguistics re-sources.
However, the comparisons also identi-fied many lexical relationships that are onlypresent in one of the language resources.3Because of the large differences in the overallsizes of the association responses in JWAD-V1and the collocations in SkE, it is not surprisingthat the word association data does not cover thenumerous collocation words present in the SkEresults.
(In future studies, we plan to examine thekinds of relationships that are extracted from thecorpora but which are not observed in the wordassociation database).
However, it is very inter-esting to note that a considerable number of theJWAD word associations were not present in theSkE results, even though the tool is drawing on amuch larger resource.
In this study, we concen-trate on describing these lexical relationships.Table 1.

While these results could beindicating a need to consider new methods orapproaches to corpus-extraction in addition tothose currently employed, these findings alsostrongly suggest that some of the lexical relation-ships might be unique to the normative word as-sociation data.
Both resources unquestionably tapinto fundamental aspects of lexical relationships,but the resources would seem to be quite differ-ent in nature.
Accordingly, the present resultssuggest that investigations into lexical relation-ships would do well to employ both corpus-basedresults and databases of word association normsin complementary ways, in order to provide morecomprehensive coverage of the diverse range oflexical relationships.The thesaurus function only outputs lexical re-lationships between words of the same wordclass.
This function also yields synonym rela-tionships that are also found in the word associa-tion norms, and are rated as being highly salientfor the thesaurus results.
For example, tanoshiiand kyomibukai (????
interesting) are wordassociation responses for omoshiroi.4.2 Lexical Relationships that are Commonto Both the Corpus-Based Results andthe Word Association NormsThis section discusses some of the lexical rela-tionships common to the two resources.
Themost frequent of these are presented in Table 2.The first ?coord?
group includes kawa (?
riv-er) with the noun of yama, tanoshii (??
?pleasant) with the adjective of omoshiroi, andodoroku (??
to be surprised) with the verb ofkizuku.
Other frequent relationships are verbalphrases involving appropriate particles (such asnounNI (e.g., jitensha ni noru (??????
toride a bicycle), noPronom, nounWO (e.g., michiwo sagasu (????
to look for a road), deVerb,niVerb).
Table 2 also includes a number of mod-ification relationships (modifier_Adv, modifi-er_Ai (e.g., atsui natsu (???
hot summer)).Note that these terms are those employed in theWord Sketch results.Table 2.

Briefly, these relationships can beclassified under six categories.
(1) Relationships involving a specific conceptrelated to the stimulus word and its contextualmeaning.
In Table 3 below, many of these areclassified as ?typically associated?
words.
Exam-ples include omoshiroi and warai (?????????
laughter), kizuku and ch?i (?
?attention), and natsu and taiy?
(??
sun).
Theserelationships are neither collocational nor gram-matical in nature, and so the grammatical analy-sis currently employed in the word sketches can-not identify them.
On the other hand, while theyare semantically related, because they often be-long to different word classes, the thesaurusfunction also fails to identify them.
(2) Relationships that are semantically similar(could be regarded as close synonyms) but do notbelong to the same word class.
Examples includesagasu and tanky?
(??
search) and kizuku and-kikubari (???
care, attention).
While theseare not grammatical or collocational relations,again, the thesaurus function is also unable tofind them because they belong to different wordclasses.
(3) Association responses consisting of morethan one word.
Examples include explanatoryphrases such as kibun ga ii (?????
lit.
?feeling is good?, comfortable) as response toomoshiroi, as well as concepts denoted by phras-es, such as hito no kao (???
human faces),also a response to omoshiroi.
(4) Relationships that could be recognized by theSkE, but which the present version fails to detect.These would seem to reflect limitations with thepresent ChaSen dictionary (e.g., it does not listchari / charinko (?????????
casualwords for bicycle) or morphological/POS-tagging errors with ChaSen, or relationships thatare not regarded as being sufficiently salientwithin the complete corpus, because they mayappear frequently as both independent words andas constituents of many poly-morpheme words(e.g., omoshiroi hito (????
interesting per-son)).
(5) Relationships that can be identified whensearch is executed for orthographic variants ofthe word, such as tsumaranai (?????
bor-ing) being found when omoshiori is written inhiragana (as ?????).
(6) Word association responses that are ratheridiosyncratic in nature, often reflecting privateexperiences of a single respondent.
The impor-tance of such responses in word association data-bases should be judged on the size of the data-base, although one also should be cautious aboutsampling issues with lower respondent numbers.While it would certainly be interesting to con-duct further comparisons between the associationnorms and other kinds of corpora, such as literaryworks, newspapers, or more balanced corpora,processed by the SkE, the main purpose of thepresent paper is to draw attention to the value ofword association databases as linguistic re-sources.
Although the lexical relationships incategories 1 and 2 were not observed in thepresent corpus-based results, they are unques-tionably of great relevance to efforts to developmore principled organizations of the lexicon fornavigational purposes, and would enhance exist-ing lexical resources, such as WordNet.
Withtrends to increasingly include multiple wordidioms and phrases within various dictionariesand linguistic resources, the multiple-word asso-ciation responses of category 3 may provide fur-ther insights into how such items are stored andprocessed.
Moreover, categories 4 and 5 clearlysuggest that free word association norms can be avery useful resource for evaluating and furtherimproving morphological analyzers, as well ascorpus query tools.5 Lexicographical Implications:Organizing Lexicons According toAssociation RelationshipsAs the merits of SkE and its significant contribu-tions to the compilation of a number of majordictionaries are discussed in detail elsewhere(e.g., Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002), and becauseSrdanovi?
and Nishina (2008) outline some poss-ible lexicographical applications of the Japaneselanguage version of the SkE, in this section, wefocus on the lexical relationships observed withinthe JWAD and their lexicographical implicationsfor realizing a principled association-based or-ganization of the lexicon.5Table 3.

(fuyu-sh?gun General Winter;hard winter; Jack Frost)5.1 Linguistic Approaches to AssociationData and Its PotentialAs previously commented, Deese (1965) andCramer (1968) have both argued that word asso-ciations closely mirror the structured patterns ofrelations that exist among concepts.
Indeed, asSinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) note, Deese(1965) was the first to conduct linguistic analysesof word association norms, such as measure-ments of semantic similarity based on his convic-tions that similar words evoke similar word asso-ciation responses?an approach that is somewhatreminiscent of Church and Hanks?
(1990) notionof mutual information.However, as we have also remarked already,the linguistic value of word association data has,regrettably, been largely overlooked.
In a similarspirit to Hirst?s (2004) claim that, notwithstand-ing certain caveats on the complex relationshipsbetween them, a lexicon can often serve as a use-ful basis for developing a practical ontology, webelieve that a very promising approach to orga-nizing the lexicon would be to more fully appre-ciate and utilize the rich variety of associativerelationships that exist within word associationnorms.
While the required, more thoroughgoinginvestigation into how to appropriately classifythe complex nature of associative relationships isbeyond the scope of this present study, in thenext sub-section, we attempt to highlight the po-tential contributions that word association normscould provide to efforts seeking to explore lexi-cal knowledge.5.2 Tentative Classification of AssociationRelationshipsTo illustrate some of the issues for developinga comprehensive, yet a parsimonious, classifica-tion of associative relationships, it is useful tobriefly consider the notion proposed by Zock andBilac (2004) and Zock (2006) of word searchstrategies in electronic dictionaries based on as-sociations.
Their outline of how such a look-upsystem might function employs three kinds ofbasic association relationships; namely, ?a kindof?
(AKO), ?subtype?
(ISA), and ?typically in-volved object, relation or actor?
(TIORA).
Whilewe accept that the limited set of just three typeswas probably motivated primarily in the interestsof simplicity, given Zock?s (2006) suggestion toenhance the navigability of the system by catego-rizing relationships, clearly the classification ofassociation relationships is a fundamental issue.Table 3 presents a tentative classification ofthe word association responses for the noun win-ter.
As the comparisons introduced in Section 4clearly demonstrate, it is usually possible to ex-tract the modification and lexical sibling rela-tionships included in Table 3 from corpora withcorpus query tools such as SkE.
However, thecomparisons also highlighted the fact that it is farmore difficult to identify the kinds of relation-ships classified in Table 3 as typically associatedwith such linguistic resources alone.
While high-ly provisional in nature, we believe that the at-tempt to classify the association relationshipswithin the association responses for fuyu can6serve to highlight some important issues for Zockand Bilac?s (2004) approach.While the lexical siblings relationships be-tween fuyu and the two response words of natsu(?
summer) and haru (?
spring) could feasiblybe represented by AKO or ISA relationship linksto shiki (??
the four seasons) outside of theassociation set itself, having to rely on externalreferences would not be a very satisfactory ap-proach to classifying the direct association rela-tionships.
Incidentally, although the ?hyponymsof ?seasons??
description would seem fairly natu-ral from the perspective of a thesaurus, the ab-sence of aki (?
autumn) from the set would in-dicate that the strengths of associations can varyeven among lexical siblings (although the ab-sence of aki from the present data could simplybe due to sampling issues).Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of sev-eral modification relationships is not very sur-prising, at least not for the prime associate ofsamui (??
cold), but the idea of fuyu having acolor attribute is perhaps initially more startling(while one many not expect ?winter?
to have adefault color slot within its range of attributes,the association of shiroi (??
white) with fuyuis initiatively appealing).For the fuyu association set, the most relevantof the association relationships specified by Zockand Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship.However, even for this relatively small associa-tion set containing just 11 main relationshiptypes, because seven of them can be initiallyclassified as ?typically associated?, clearly thisdesignation alone is too encompassing to be auseful classification category.
The inclusion ofthe description field in Table 3 is an attempt tofurther define meaningful sub-categories.
In thecase of the sub-category ?meteorological pheno-mena?, it would seem to be well motivated toexplain the associations between fuyu as the sti-mulus word and yuki (?
snow) and k?ri (?
ice)as two response words.
However, while the sub-category of ?cultural artifacts?
clearly goes someway to pinpointing the underlying associationbetween fuyu and kotatsu (???
), it does relyon a certain cultural familiarity with the kind ofquilted kind of blanket that are used for keepingone?s legs warm when sitting around a low fami-ly table during winter.
A natural association foranyone who has ever lived in Japan during thewinter months, but ?typically associated?
+ ?cul-tural artifact?
seems to miss something of thenaturalness.6 ConclusionsThis paper has compared the lexical relationshipsobserved within Japanese collocation data ex-tracted from a large corpus using the Japaneselanguage version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tooland the relationships found within Japanese wordassociation sets taken from the large-scale Japa-nese Word Association Database (JWAD).The comparison results indicate that whilemany lexical relationships are common to bothlinguistic resources, a number of lexical relation-ships were only observed in one of the resources.The fact that some lexical relationships might beunique to word association norms demonstratesthe value of word association databases as lin-guistic resources.
The present findings suggestthat both resources can be effectively used incombination in order to provide more compre-hensive coverage of the wide range of lexicalrelationships.Finally, we presented a tentative classificationof the association relationships in the associationset for fuyu.
Our brief discussion of the classifi-cation sought to reflect on some of the challengesto realizing a principled association-based organ-ization of the lexicon as a fundamental step to-ward implementing cognitively-salient word-search strategies based on associations in elec-tronic dictionaries.ReferencesAtkins, Sue, Charles J.
