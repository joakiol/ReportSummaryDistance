ErjavecJoz?ef Stefan Institute, Sloveniatomaz.erjavec@ijs.siAbstractThis paper describes the modeling ofthe morphosyntactic annotations of theMULTEXT-East corpora and lexicons asan OWL/DL ontology.
Formalizing anno-tation schemes in OWL/DL has the advan-tages of enabling formally specifying in-terrelationships between the various fea-tures and making logical inferences basedon the relationships between them.
Weshow that this approach provides us witha top-down perspective on a large set ofmorphosyntactic specifications for multi-ple languages, and that this perspectivehelps to identify and to resolve concep-tual problems in the original specifications.Furthermore, the ontological modeling al-lows us to link the MULTEXT-East spe-cifications with repositories of annotationterminology such as the General Ontol-ogy of Linguistics Descriptions or the ISOTC37/SC4 Data Category Registry.1 IntroductionIn the last 15 years, the heterogeneity of linguis-tic annotations has been identified as a key prob-lem limiting the interoperability and reusabil-ity of NLP tools and linguistic data collections.The multitude of linguistic tagsets complicatesthe combination of NLP modules within a sin-gle pipeline; similar problems exist in languagedocumentation, typology and corpus linguistics,where researchers are interested to access andquery data collections on a homogeneous termi-nological basis.One way to enhance the consistency of lin-guistic annotations is to provide explicit seman-tics for tags by grounding annotations in termino-logy repositories such as the General Ontologyof Linguistics Descriptions (Farrar and Langen-doen, 2003, GOLD) or the ISO TC37/SC4 DataCategory Registry (Kemps-Snijders et al, 2009,ISOcat).
Reference definitions provide an inter-lingua that allows the mapping of linguistic an-notations from annotation scheme A to schemeB.
This application requires linking annotationschemes with the terminological repository.
Thisrelation can be formalized within the Linked Dataparadigm (Berners-Lee, 2006), which requiresthe use of uniform resource identifiers (URIs),the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), standardrepresentation formats (such as RDF) and links toother URIs.
Here, we propose a formalization ofthis linking in OWL/DL, a notational variant ofthe Description Logic SHOIN (D) that buildson RDF and Linked Data.Another way to enhance the consistency oflinguistic annotations is to make use of cross-linguistic meta schemes or annotation standards,such as EAGLES (Leech and Wilson, 1996).
Theproblem is that these enforce the use of the samecategories across multiple languages, and thismay be inappropriate for historically and geo-graphically unrelated languages.
For specific lin-guistic and historical regions, the application ofstandardization approaches has, however, beenperformed with great success, e.g., for Western(Leech and Wilson, 1996) and Eastern Europe(Erjavec et al, 2003) or the Indian subcontinent(Baskaran et al, 2008).11In this paper, we illustrate differences andcommonalities of both approaches by creatingan OWL/DL terminology repository from theMULTEXT-East (MTE) specifications (Erjavecet al, 2003; Erjavec, 2010), which define featuresfor the morphosyntactic level of linguistic de-scription, instantiate them for 16 languages andprovide morphosyntactic tagsets for these lan-guages.
The specifications are a part of the MTEresources, which also include lexicons and an an-notated parallel corpus that use these morphosyn-tactic tagsets.The encoding of the MTE specifications fol-lows the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines, TEIP5 (TEI Consortium, 2007), and this paper con-centrates on developing a semi-automatic pro-cedure for converting them from TEI XML toOWL.
While TEI is more appropriate for author-ing the specifications and displaying them in abook-oriented format, the OWL encoding has theadvantages of enabling formally specifying inter-relationships between the various features (con-cepts, or classes) and making logical inferencesbased on the relationships between them, usefulin mediating between different tagsets and tools(Chiarcos, 2008).2 The MULTEXT-East (MTE)Morphosyntactic SpecificationsThe MTE morphosyntactic specifications defineattributes and values used for word-level syntac-tic annotation, i.e., they provide a formal gram-mar for the morphosyntactic properties of the lan-guages covered.
The specifications also containcommentary, bibliography, notes, etc.
Follow-ing the original MULTEXT proposal (Ide andVe?ronis, 1994), the specifications define 14 cat-egories (parts of speech), and for each its at-tributes, their values, and the languages that everyattribute-value pair is appropriate for.
The mor-phosyntactic specifications also define the map-ping between the feature structures and mor-phosyntactic descriptions (MSDs).
MSDs arecompact strings used as tags for corpus annota-tion and in the morphosyntactic lexicons.
Forexample, the MSD Ncmsn is equivalent to thefeature structure consisting of the attribute-valuepairs Noun, Type=common, Gender=masculine,Number=singular, Case=nominative.The specifications currently cover 16 lan-guages, in particular: Bulgarian, Croatian,Czech, English, Estonian, Hungarian, Macedo-nian, Persian, Polish, Resian, Romanian, Rus-sian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian.For a number of these languages the specifica-tions have become a de-facto standard and, forsome, the MTE lexicons and corpora are still theonly publicly available datasets for this level oflinguistic description.1Table 1 lists the defined categories and givesthe number of distinct attributes, attribute-valuepairs and the number of MTE languages whichdistinguish the category.
The feature-set is quitelarge, as many of the languages covered havevery rich inflection, are typologically different(inflectional, agglutinating), but also have inde-pendent traditions of linguistic description; thisalso leads to similar phenomena sometimes be-ing expressed by different means (see Sect.

It first gives the category, the lan-guages that distinguish it, and then its attributeswith their values; the meaning of a particular rowor cell is given by its role attribute.
As with thecategory, each attribute-value is also qualified bythe languages that make use of the feature.
Notethat MTE is a positional tagset that specifies theposition of the attribute in the MSD string, andthe one-letter code of its value, so that Nc wouldcorrespond to Noun, Type=common.The language-specific sections also contain ta-bles for each category, which are similar to thecommon tables in that they repeat the attributesand their values, although only those appropri-ate for the language.
The language-specific ta-bles can also contain localization information,i.e., the names of the categories, attributes, theirvalues and codes in the particular language, inaddition to English.
This enables expressing thefeature structures and MSDs either in English orin the language in question.
Furthermore, eachlanguage-specific section can also contain an in-dex listing all valid MSDs.
This index is aug-mented with frequency information and exam-ples of usage drawn for a corpus.In addition to the source TEI P5 XML, theMTE specifications are delivered in various de-rived formats, in particular HTML for readingand as tabular files, which map the MSD tagsetinto various feature decompositions.3 Linking annotation schemes withterminology repositories3.1 Linguistic terminology initiativesThere have been, by now, several approachesto develop terminology repositories and datacategory registries for language resources, sys-tems for mapping between diverse (morphosyn-tactic) vocabularies and for integrating annota-tions from different tools and tagsets, rangingfrom early texts on annotation standards (Bakkeret al, 1993; Leech and Wilson, 1996) over re-lational models and concept hierarchies (Bickeland Nichols, 2002; Rosen, 2010) to more formalspecifications in OWL/RDF (or with OWL/RDFexport), e.g., the already mentioned GOLD andISOcat, OntoTag (Aguado de Cea et al, 2002)or the Typological Database System ontology(Saulwick et al, 2005).Despite their common level of representationthese efforts have not yet converged into a unifiedand generally accepted ontology of linguistic an-notation terminology and there is still a consider-able amount of disagreement between their def-initions.
As these repositories nevertheless playan important role in their respective communi-ties, it is desirable to link the MTE specificationswith the most representative of them, notablywith GOLD and the morphosyntactic profile ofISOcat.
As we argue below, different design de-cisions in the terminology repositories make itnecessary to use a linking formalism that is capa-ble of expressing both disjunctions and conjunc-tions of concepts.
For this reason, we propose theapplication of OWL/DL.By representing the MTE specifications, therepositories, and the linking between them asseparate OWL/DL models, we follow the archi-tectural concept of the OLiA architecture (Chiar-cos, 2008), see Sect.
5.133.2 Annotation mappingThe classic approach to link annotations with ref-erence concepts is to specify rules that define adirect mapping (Zeman, 2008).
It is, however,not always possible to find a 1:1 mapping.One problem is conceptual overlap: A com-mon noun may occur as a part of a proper name,e.g., German Palais ?baroque-style palace?
inNeues Palais lit.
?new palace?, a Prussian royalpalace in Potsdam/Germany.
Palais is thus both aproper noun (in its function), and a common noun(in its form).
Such conceptual overlap is some-times represented with a specialized tag, e.g., inthe TIGER scheme (Brants and Hansen, 2002).ISOcat (like other terminological repositories)does currently not provide the corresponding hy-brid category, so that Palais is to be linked to bothproperNoun/DC-1371 and commonNoun/DC-1256 if the information carried by the originalannotation is to be preserved.
Contractions posesimilar problems: English gonna combines going(PTB tag VBG, Marcus et al, 1994) and to (TO).If whitespace tokenization is applied, both tagsneed to be assigned to the same token.A related problem is the representation of am-biguity: The SUSANNE (Sampson, 1995) tagICSt applies to English after both as a prepo-sition and as a subordinating conjunction.
Thecorresponding ISOcat category is thus eitherpreposition/DC-1366 or subordinatingConjunction/DC-1393.
Without additionaldisambiguation, ICSt needs to be linked to bothdata categories.Technically, such problems can be solved witha 1:n mapping between annotations and refer-ence concepts.
Yet, overlap/contraction and am-biguity differ in their meaning: While overlap-ping/contracted categories are in the intersec-tion (?)
of reference categories, ambiguous cate-gories are in their join (?).
This difference is rel-evant for subsequent processing, e.g., to decidewhether disambiguation is necessary.
A mappingapproach, however, fails to distinguish ?
and ?.The linking between reference categories andannotations requires a formalism that can distin-guish intersection and join operators.
A less ex-pressive linking formalism that makes use of a1:1 (or 1:n) mapping between annotation con-cepts and reference concepts can lead to inconsis-tencies when mapping annotation concepts froman annotation scheme A to an annotation schemeB if these use the same terms with slightly deviat-ing definitions, as noted, for example, by Garab?
?ket al (2009) for MTE.3.3 Annotation linking with OWL/DLOWL/DL is a formalism that supports the nec-essary operators and flexibility.
Reference con-cepts and annotation concepts are formalizedas OWL classes and the linking between themcan be represented by rdfs:subClassOf (?
).OWL/DL provides owl:intersectionOf (?
),owl:unionOf (?)
and owl:complementOf(?)
operators and it allows the definition of prop-erties and restrictions on the respective concepts.As an example, the MTE Definiteness=definiterefers to either a clitic determiner or (?)
to the?definite conjunction?
of Hungarian verbs.
Moreprecisely, it is in the intersection between theseand (?)
a category for ambiguous feature values(Sect.
4.3).An OWL/DL-based formalization has the ad-ditional advantage that it can be linked with exist-ing terminology repositories that are available inOWL or RDF, e.g., GOLD or ISOcat (Chiarcos,2010).
The linking to other terminology reposi-tories will be subject of subsequent research.
Inthis paper, we focus on the development of anOWL/DL representation of MTE morphosyntac-tic specifications that represents a necessary pre-condition for OWL/DL-based annotation linking.4 Building the MTE ontologyWe built the MTE ontology2 in a three-step sce-nario: first, a preliminary OWL/DL model of thecommon MTE specifications was created (Sect.4.1); we then built language-specific subontolo-gies and linked them to the common ontology(Sect.
4.2); finally, the outcome of this process2All MTE ontologies are available underhttp://nl.ijs.si/ME/owl/ under a CreativeCommons Attribution licence (CC BY 3.0).14was discussed with a group of experts and revised(Sect.
4.3).4.1 Common specificationsFollowing the methodology described by Chiar-cos (2008), the structure of the MTE ontologywas derived from the original documentation.The initial ontology skeleton was created auto-matically (the organization of the specificationswas exploited to develop an XSLT script thatmapped TEI XML to OWL), but subsequentlymanually augmented with descriptions and ex-amples found in the individual languages.1.
Two top-level concepts Morphosyn-tacticCategory and Morphosyntac-ticFeature represent root elements ofthe MTE ontology.
An object propertyhasFeature maps a Morphosyntac-ticCategory onto one or multipleMorphosyntacticFeature values.2.
All MSD categories are subconcepts ofMorphosyntacticCategory, e.g., Noun,Verb, Adjective, etc.3.
For every category, the MTE attributeType was used to infer subcategories, e.g.,the concept ExclamativePronoun (?Pronoun) for Pronoun/Type=exclamative.4.
From more specialized type attributes(e.g., Wh Type, Coord Type, Sub Type,and Referent Type), additional subcate-gories were induced at the next deeperlevel, e.g., SimpleCoordinatingCon-junction (?
CoordinatingConjunc-tion) from Conjunction/Type=coordina-ting, Coord Type=simple.5.
All remaining attributes are subconceptsof MorphosyntacticFeature, e.g.,Aspect, Case, etc.6.
For every subconcept of Morphosyntac-ticFeature (e.g., Aspect) a corres-ponding hasFeature subproperty (e.g.,hasAspect) was introduced, with the mor-phosyntactic feature as its range and the joinof morphosyntactic categories it can cooc-cur with as its domain.
An additional con-straint restricts its cardinality to at most 1.7.
All attribute values are represented assubclasses of the corresponding at-tribute concept, e.g., AbessiveCase (forCase=abessive) as a subconcept of Case.38.
Every concept was automatically aug-mented with a list of up to 10 examples forevery language which were drawn from thelanguage-specific MSD index.4.2 Language-specific subontologiesHaving represented the common MTE specifica-tions in OWL, we decided to represent the an-notation scheme for every language in a separateOWL model, and to make use of the OWL im-port mechanism to link it with the common spe-cifications.
The language-specific subontologiesdo not specify their own taxonomy, but ratherinherit the concepts and properties of the com-mon model.
Unlike the common model, they in-clude individuals that provide information aboutthe tags (MSDs) used for this particular language.Every individual corresponds to an MSD tag.We use data properties of the OLiA system on-tology4 to indicate its string realization (e.g.,system:hasTag ?Ncmsn?)
and the designatorof its annotation layer (e.g., system:hasTier?pos?).
Additionally, rdfs:comment elementscontain all examples of the original MSD speci-fications.In accordance to the specified annotation val-ues, every individual is defined as an instanceof the corresponding MorphosyntacticCate-gory (e.g., Noun) and MorphosyntacticFea-ture (e.g., SingularNumber) from the com-mon specifications.
Additionally, for every Mor-phosyntacticFeature (e.g., Number, the su-perconcept of SingularNumber), it is assigned3This ontology does not contain individuals.
In ourapproach, individuals represent feature bundles in thelanguage-specific subontologies, corresponding to the indi-vidual MSD tags.
(or, in other application scenarios, thetoken that the tag is applied to).4http://nachhalt.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/owl/system.owl, prefix system15<mte:Noun rdf:ID="Ncmsn_sl"><system:hasTag>Ncmsn</system:hasTag><system:hasTier>pos</system:hasTier><rdf:typerdf:resource="...#CommonNoun"/><rdf:typerdf:resource="...#MasculineGender"/><rdf:typerdf:resource="...#SingularNumber"/><rdf:typerdf:resource="...#NominativeCase"/><mte:hasGender rdf:resource="#Ncmsg_sl"/><mte:hasNumber rdf:resource="#Ncmsg_sl"/><mte:hasCase rdf:resource="#Ncmsg_sl"/><rdfs:comment>e.g., cas, svet, denar, ...</mte:Noun>Figure 2: MSD Ncmsn in the Slovene subontologyitself as target of the corresponding object prop-erty (e.g., hasNumber).Figure 2 shows the subontology entry for thetag Ncmsn in the Slovene subontology.
The indi-vidual could thus be retrieved with the followingqueries for ?singular noun?
:(1) Noun and hasNumber someSingularNumber(2) Noun and SingularNumberThe language-specific subontologies were fullyautomatically created from the TEI XML usingXSLT scripts.
During the revision of the com-mon specifications, these scripts were updatedand reapplied.4.3 Revision of the initial OWL modelAfter the automatic conversion from XML toOWL the resulting ontology skeleton of thecommon specifications was manually augmentedwith descriptions, explanations and selectedexamples from the language-specific MTE spe-cifications.
Furthermore, concept names with ab-breviated or redundant names were adjusted, e.g.,the concept CorrelatCoordConjunction(Coord Type=correlat) was expanded toCorrelativeCoordinatingConjunction,and DefiniteDefiniteness (Definite-ness=definite) was simplified to Definite.Finally, if one attribute value represents aspecialization of another, the former wasrecast as a subconcept of the latter (e.g.,CliticProximalDeterminer ?
CliticDe-finiteDeterminer).Moreover, a number of potential problemswere identified.
Some of them could be ad-dressed by consulting MTE-related publications(Qasemizadeh and Rahimi, 2006; Dimitrova etal., 2009; Derzhanski and Kotsyba, 2009), butmost were solved with the help of the originalauthors of the MTE specifications and an opendiscussion with these experts over a mailing list.The problems fall in two general classes:(a) terminological problems, and (b) conceptualproblems.
By terminological problems we meanthat a term required a more precise definitionthan provided in the MTE specifications; con-ceptual problems pertain to design decisions ina positional tagset (overload: the same annota-tion refers to two different phenomena in dif-ferent languages) and to artifacts of the creationprocess of the MTE specifications (redundancies:the same phenomenon is represented in differentways for different languages).
Figure 3 showsa fragment of the MTE ontology that showed alltypes of conceptual problems as described below.Terminological problems include the use ofnon-standard or language-specific terminology(e.g., Clitic=burkinostka for conventional collo-cations in Polish, or Case=essive-formal for Hun-garian), and the need to understand design deci-sions that were necessary for language-specificphenomena (e.g., Numeral/Class=definite34 forCzech and Polish quantifiers with the same pat-terns of agreement as the numerals 3 and 4).In the course of the revision, most non-standard terms were replaced with conven-tional, language-independent concept names, andlanguage-specific phenomena were documentedby adding relevant excerpts from discussions orliterature as owl:versionInfo.For a few concepts, no language-independentcharacterization could be found.
For exam-ple, Numeral/Form=m form refers to numer-als with the suffix -ma in Bulgarian (a specialform of the numerals ?2?
to ?7?
for persons ofmasculine gender).
In the ontology, the con-cept MFormNumeral is preserved, but it is con-strained so that every instance matches the fol-16lowing OWL/DL expression:(3) CardinalNumber and hasAnimacy someAnimate and hasGender some MasculineAttribute overload means that one attributegroups together unrelated phenomena from dif-ferent languages.
In a positional tagset, attributeoverload is a natural strategy to achieve compactand yet expressive tags.
As every attribute re-quires its own position in the tag, the length ofMSD tags grows with the number of attributes.Overload thus reduces tag complexity.
To an on-tological model, however, these complexity con-siderations do not apply, whereas proper concep-tual differentiations are strongly encouraged.We thus decided to disentangle the varioussenses of overloaded attributes.
For example, theMorphosyntacticFeature Definiteness,is split up in three subconcepts (cf.
Fig.
3).CliticDeterminerType: presence of a post-fixed article of Romanian, Bulgarian andPersian nouns and adjectives.ReductionFeature: the difference betweenfull and reduced adjectives in many Slaviclanguages.PersonOfObject: the so-called ?definite con-jugation?
of Hungarian verbs.Value overload has a similar meaning to at-tribute overload.
Definiteness=definite, for ex-ample, can refer to a clitic definite determiner(a CliticDeterminerType in Romanian andBulgarian), to a clitic determiner that expressesspecificity (a CliticDeterminerType in Per-sian), or to a verb with a definite 3rd-person di-rect object (a PersonOfObject in Hungarian).In the ontology, this is represented by defin-ing Definite as a subconcept of the owl:join(?)
of CliticDefiniteDeterminer, Cli-ticSpecificDeterminer and PersonOfOb-ject.
Additional concepts, e.g., Ambigu-ousDefinitenessFeature, were created toanchor ambiguous concepts like Definite inthe taxonomy (see Fig.
3).Redundancy: For many languages, the MTEspecifications were created in a bottom-up fash-ion, where existing NLP tools and lexicons wereFigure 3: Definiteness in the MTE ontologyintegrated with a pre-existing taxonomy of an-notation categories.
Language-specific featureswere introduced when necessary, but sometimesin different ways for the same phenomenon inclosely related languages.
The MTE specifica-tions thus comprise a certain degree of redun-dancy.For example, the distinction between full andreduced adjectives in Slavic languages is ex-pressed differently: For Czech, reduced adjec-tives are marked by Formation=nominal, but forPolish by Definiteness=short-art.In the ontology, such redundancies are re-solved by owl:equivalentClass statements,marked by ?
in Fig.
3.5 Summary and DiscussionWe have described the semi-automatic creationof an ontological model of the MTE morphosyn-tactic specifications for 16 different languages.Such a model may be fruitfully applied invarious ways, e.g., within an NLP pipeline thatuses ontological specifications of annotationsrather than their string representations (Buykoet al, 2008; Hellmann, 2010).
The ontolog-ical modeling may serve also as a first steptowards an ontology-based documentation ofthe annotations within a corpus query system(Rehm et al, 2007; Chiarcos et al, 2008),17or even the ontological modeling of entirecorpora (Burchardt et al, 2008; Hellmann etal., 2010) and lexicons (Martin et al, 2009).As an interesting side-effect of the OWL con-version of the entire body of MTE resources,they could be easily integrated with existinglexical-semantic resources as Linked Data, e.g.,OWL/RDF versions of WordNet (Gangemi etal., 2003), which are currently being assem-bled by various initiatives, e.g., in the contextof the LOD2 project (http://lod2.eu)and by the Open Linguistics WorkingGroup at the OpenKnowledge Foundation(http://linguistics.okfn.org).Another very important element is that the on-tological modeling of the MTE annotations al-lows it to be interpreted in terms of existingrepositories of annotation terminology such asISOcat and GOLD.
A bridge between these ter-minology repositories and the MTE ontologymay be developed, for example, by integrat-ing the ontology in an architecture of modularontologies such as the Ontologies of Linguis-tic Annotations (Chiarcos, 2008, OLiA), wherethe linking between annotations and terminologyrepositories is mediated by a so-called ?Refer-ence Model?
that serves as an interface betweendifferent levels of representation.The MTE ontology will be integrated in thismodel as an annotation model, i.e., its conceptswill be defined as subconcepts of concepts of theOLiA Reference Model and thereby inherit thelinking with GOLD (Chiarcos et al, 2008) andISOcat (Chiarcos, 2010).
The linking with thesestandard repositories increases the comparabilityof MTE annotations and it serves an importantdocumentation function.More important than merely potential applica-tions of the MTE ontology, however, is that itscreation provides us with a new, global perspec-tive on the MTE specifications.
A number ofinternal inconsistencies could be identified andstrategies for their resolution (or formalization)were developed.
Redundancies and overloadwere documented, and we further added expertdefinitions of controversial or non-standard con-cepts.
When used as a documentation, these spe-cifications may prevent misunderstandings withrespect to the meaning of the actual annotations.For later versions of the MTE morphosyntacticspecifications, they may even guide the refactor-ing of the annotation scheme.The result of the development process de-scribed above is a prototype, that has to be aug-mented with definitions for non-controversial andwell-understood concepts, which can be derivedfrom the linking with OLiA, GOLD and ISOcat.As for its language type, our strategy to resolveoverload requires OWL/DL (owl:join).
With-out value overload and redundancy, the ontologywould be OWL/Lite, as were the initial ontolo-gies (Sect.
4.1 and Sect.
4.2).
However, the cur-rent modeling is still sufficiently restricted to al-low the application of reasoners, thereby open-ing up the possibility to use SemanticWeb tech-nologies on MTE data, to connect it with othersources of information and to draw inferencesfrom such Linked Data.We would also like to point out that the conver-sion of the MTE specifications to OWL requiredrelatively little effort.
The total time requiredfor conversion (without the revision phase) tookapproximately four days of work for a compu-tational linguist familiar with OWL and part-of-speech tagsets in general (the most labor-intensepart were discussions and literature consultationduring the revision phase).
Given the complexityof the MTE specifications (a highly elaborate setof morphosyntactic specifications for 16 typolog-ically diverse languages and with more than thou-sand tags for many of the languages), this may beregarded an upper limit for the time necessary tocreate OWL models for annotation schemes.We have thus not only shown that the ontolog-ical modeling of annotation schemes is possibleand that it allows us to use our data in novel waysand to perform consistency control, but also thatthis was achievable with relatively low efforts intime and personnel.18AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the members ofthe mocky-l mailing list for their invaluable in-put; all errors in the paper remain our own.
