Their coment, structure and size cru-cially determines the applicability of these systems,and still their development and maintenance is a seri-ous bottleneck.
Taking into account he enormousamount of entries required for practical purposes,manual modelling procedures are hardly practicable.Much effort is therefore devoted to achieving a con-trolled automatic handling of these tasks.In tiffs paper a proposal is made to use a meaningdictionary as a source of conceptual knowledge, andto apply text understanding methods for processingthis information.
These methods include the automa-tic acquisition of conceptual definitions from mea-ning paraphrases, their transformation into a suitablerepresentation forautomatic processing, and the au-tomatic update of conceptual definitions by means oftext analysis.A meaning dictionary explains the use of naturallanguage xpressions with respect to tile access theyprovide to world knowledge.
In principle, the kzlow-ledge accessed and thus represented in a meaning dic-tionary includes many of the different kinds of know-ledge which are required for semantic informationprocessing (i.e.
"how nature works, practices, institu-tions, facts of nature, regularities, ways of doing"\[Searle 80:227\]).Current research work on extracting inlbrmationfrom machine-readable dictionaries (cf.
e.g.
\[Bris-coe/Copestake/Boguraev 90\], \[Walker/ Zampolli/Calzolari 88\], \[Alshawi 87\], \[Nakamura/Nagao 88\])has mainly concentrated on semantic relationships ofthe vocabulary and has proposed methods for semi-automatic or partial extraction of this information.These methods basically rely on syntactic structuresof meaning paraphrases or database-like coded lea-tures and values (see also \[Briscoe/Copestake/Bogu-raev 90\]).
The task of acquiring conceptual informa-tion, however, laces the problem that his informationin traditional meaning dictionaries is itself conveyedin terms of the means natural language provides forcommunicating conceptual information, amely na-tural language texts (meaning paraphrases, defini-tions, even longer explanatory texts or abbreviatedtextual orms).
Thus understanding conceptual defi-nitions of meaning dictionaries requires textualmechanisms to be recognized and handled in order toanalyse the information provided and to construct asemantic representation.In this paper anew method of textually modellingmeaning paraplwases i proposed for the acquisitionof a formal representation of tfie conceptual informa-tion conveyed in the meaning paraphrase.
It is de-scribed how these paraphrases are subjected to amanual text analysis process in accordance with theKONTEXT model \[Haenelt/K0nyves-T6th 91 \].Theprinciples hown are general principles of text analy-sis and are also applied in the KONTEXT system totextual analysis of corpora (provided a basic set ofdictionary entries is available).
The conceptual mo-delling is based on the model of Semantic Emphasis\[Kunze 91\], which so far has been worked out forverbs.
In order to be able to cover the meaning para-phrase as a whole, and thus to provide abasis for auto-matic bootstrapping, this approach has to be exteudedto modelling other word classes.
A proposal for tiffs ismade in this paper.First of all this paper introduces the approach totextually modelling meaning paraphrases, then anexample is given.
The concept and text structure re-lated information i  the system dictionary which isused as a basis of acquisition as well as for represen-ting the newly acquired entries is presented indetail.The application of the dictionary to the analysis of ameaning paraphrase is explained.Act~.s DE COL1NG-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 l 2 0 9 PROC.

23-28, 19922 TEXTUAL MODELLING OF MEANINGPARAPHRASES2.1 APPROACHThe KONTEXT model \[Haenelt/KOnyves-T6th91 \] assumes that natural anguage texts do not com-municate complex concepts immediately and at once,but rather provide sequential instructions concerninghow to construct them incrementally.
The instruc-tions are established by the natural language xpres-sions, which, used in texts, not onty have the functionof denoting concepts, but rather can be seen as opera-tors which contribute to the construction ofthematicstructures and reference objects.
Thematic structureand reference objects then guide the access to eon~eepts and the incremental construction of new con-cept definitions communicated by the text.
The KeN-TEXT model structures the information conveyed ina text and the information describing its contextualorganization i to five layers of text representation:sentence structure, thematic structure, view (on back-ground knowledge), and background knowledge.In order to construct a conceptual definition in ac-cordance with a meaning paraphrase, the paraphrasemust be analyzed step by step under textual aspects.Each natural language xpression contributes in-formation towards the construction fat least one ofthe four upper layers of text representation.
The iu-formation of rite expressions of the meaning para-phrase is analyzed and a five-layereA multi-state textrepresentation s generated.
'ltfis generation i cludesoperations which incrementally construct (new) con-cept(s) and establish the relationship between aturallanguage expressions, reference objects ,and conceptsvia the thematic structure.2.2 EXAMPLEAs an example the fi~llowing meaning paraphraseof "blank" is used: "A blank piece of paper has nowriting or other mark.~ on it."
\[COBUILD 87\].
A tex-tuM representation f this paraphrase is shown in fi-gure 1.
The figure illustrates how the conceptual defi-nition of "blank" is constructed step by step.
It showsa text representation with Iigur layers and five states.The 'sentence structure' contains the lexemes, theirdependency structure (and further syntactic featuresnot shown here).
The information of the 'sentencestructure' basically lollows the PLAIN-grammar\[Hellwig 80, 88\].
The 'thematic structure' traces thediscourse development.
It shows contexts (cL boxes1-5 in figure 1; the numbers refer to file discoursestates of their creation), and reti~rences to contexts(represented by the lines between the boxes) whichcorrespond to discourse state transitions.

The layer of 'view'shows views on the 'background knowledge' whichhave been established by state transitions.
The 'back-ground knowledge' (which is shown in figures 2and3) contains conceptual descriptions of prototypicalsituations in accordance with the model of SemanticEmphasis \[Kunze 91\].
These descriptions are ex-plained in more detail in section 2.3.1.The states trace the incremental construction f the fi-lial view (\[5\]) of the meaning paraphrase and the(re-)definition of the relationship between aturallanguage expressions and reference objects.
So,whilst the dellniendnm "blank" had no conceptualdefinition in the initial state (1), in the final state (5) aconceptual definition has been constructed by analy-zing the meaning paraphrase under textual aspects.2.3 THE KONTEXT DICTIONARYThe contribution atural anguage xpressionsmake towards the layers of the text representation isdescribed as a lexicalized text grammar.
The informaotion of all the five layers is modelled in feature struc-tures which are processed with the CFS-system\[K6nyves-T6th 91\] \[B6ttcher 91\].
Due to the forma-lism chosen the basic operation isunification.2.3.1 CONCEP'I~dAL INFORMATIONThe conceptual modelling of the KONTEXT dic-tionary is based on the model of Semantic Emphasis\[Kunze 91\].
The core components of this model are'basic semantic forms' which describe prototypicalsituations commonly referred to by tile verbs of a verbfield.
A 'basic semantic form' is a proposition con-sisting of predicates and (propositional orelementa-ry) arguments.
So, e.g.
the propositional descriptionofa 'write'-situation is: CAUSE ( ACT (x), El" (BEC(EXIST(w,t)), BEC (PLACE-ON (q,w)))).
This de-scription can be paraphrased in the tollowing way: Anaction of 'x' causes a 't' to become to exist as 'w' andthis 'w' to become placed somewhere such that a rela-tion 'ON' holds true between 'q' and 'w'.
The schemeof 'write' is based on the general scheme of a pro-duce-situation.Situation descriptions provide the basic schemesof the layer of background knowledge of dictionaryentries.
They are used for the construction fthe layerof 'view' during text analysis.
They can immediatelybe applied to the modelling of verbs.
For modellingfurther word classes the following extensions aremade: Similarly to Conceptual Dependency ap-proaches (e.g.
\]Schank 75\]) in file KONTEXT ap-proach 'basic semantic forms' are the backbone ofconceptual modelling.
Verbs and deverbative abstractnouns are modelled as referring to prototypical situa-tions following the descriptions of the model of Se-mantic Emphasis.
Prepositions are modelled as deno-ting parts of those situations which have actantswhich in the surface form can be realized with thepreposition i question.
Noons are modelled as deno-ting participants of situations, and adjectives as deno-ting situations focusing on a particular participant.The defining situations of nouns and adjectives aredetermined in accordance with the meaning para-phrases of \[COBUILD 87\] following the textualconditions of applying the situations concerned.
CO-BUILD definitions are also used in order to describefield external distinctions of verbs.The formal components of the conceptual repre-sentation are the feature structure representation of'basic semantic forms', instantiation rules and rolederivation rules following tile approach of \[Kunze911.The propositional description of the 'write'-situationis modelled in feature structures in tile following way:\[ CAUSE@<>prep: \[ al :\[ A(Tr@<>prop:al :ref: 'x' \]a2:\[ET@<>prop:\[ al:\[ BEC@<>prop:al:\[ EXIST@<>prop:\[ al:ref: 'w'a2:ref: 't' \]\]\]a2: \[ BEC@ <>prop:al:\[ PLACE-ON@<>prop:\[ al:ref: 'q'a2:ref:'w' \]\]1\]\]\]1Figure 2: Propositional description of a 'write'-situationPredicate names are written in capital etters.
@<>indicates reference to a type, where <> enclose pathdescriptions.
The arguments ofpredicates are valuesof the feature 'prop'.
Elementary arguments corres-pond to possible reference objects.Depending on the predicates used, instantiationrules are applied in order to get a more refined de-scription of the situation.
E.g.
a proposition BEC(A)instantiates a monotonic path such that initiallyNOT(A) holds true, mad finally (A) holds true.NOT(A) is also called the 'presupposition' f the situ-ation, and (A) is (one of) its 'assertion(s)' \[Jung/Kilstner 90\].
The predicate ET has two propositionalarguments and requires its arguments o be instan-tiated at the same time.
Thus, either the presupposi-tion or the assertion of both arguments is selected.For elementary argnments case relations arederived in accordance with a purely formal definitionscheme (Kunze's approach (91) provides atheoreti-cal description and formalization of Fillmore's (68)deep cases).The resulting case relations of e.g.

1992'write'-situation are: 'agens of ACT', 'to-object ofEXIST', 'goal of PLACE-ON', 'goal of EXIST', and'to-object of PLACE-ON'.A perspective on the situation is determined by em-phasis and the selection of actual case relations fromthe derived potential roles.
By means of emphasis\[Kunze 911 certain partial propositions are movedinto the foreground.2.3.2 TEXT STRUCTURE INFORMATIONBased on the model of Semantic Emphasis in-formation concerning the reference structure and thethematic structure can be derived systematically fromconceptual information.Potential reference objects are provided for all pos-sible participants of the situation.
The roles they playin the situation are expressed as case relations.Thematic information includes information such aswhich participants can be realized emphatically (notemphatically) in which surface form.
So, e.g.
file pri-mary effect of the action of writing (in the prototypi-cal case) is that a writing exists, while it is less impor-tant where it appears.
Therefore at least one of the ar-guments of the EXIST-predicate has to be realizedemphatically (i.e.
not by a prepositional phrase) andthose of the PLACE-ON-predicate are either ealizedwithout emphasis (by a prepositional phrase) or theyare not realized at all.
This information then providesthe basis for mechanisms ofreferring to contexts.
E.g.only those reference objects which have been realizedemphatically can later be referred to by an anaphori-cal pronoun.2.4 APPLICATION OF THE KONTEXT DIC-TIONARY TO MODELL ING THE MEA-NING PARAPHRASEThe words of the meaning paraphrase ("A blankpiece of paper has no writing on it") contribute to theconstitution of the text representation in the followingway:"Has" does not make a contribution to the con-ceptual definition.
It only "provides a verb for thestructure" \[COBUILD 87:6671 and indicates the ab-stractum "writing".
"Blankpiece ofpaper" introduces a participant ofa situation.
Its surface form and its syntactic functioncontribute to determining which participant of whichsituation it can be.
The defining situation of "paper"(cf.
meaning paraphrase of "paper") must be com-patible with the newly composed situation itbecomesa participant of (e.g.
the situation of this meaningparaphrase).
Otherwise a further text is requirod in or-der to solve this conflict.
"Writing" as a noun denotes aparticipant of a si-marion, and as a deverbative abstractum atthe sametime introduces the situation of which it is a partici-pant.
This is the 'write'-situation described in section2.3.1.
"No" does not make a conceptual contribution ofits own.
It, however, has the effect that tile presuppo-sition of the 'write'-situation must be selected.
"On" as a preposition denotes parts of those situa-tions which have aclants which in the surface formcan be realized with this preposition.
In this case it is acomplement of "writing" and serves to introduce theactant of "writing" which is determined by the firstargument of PLACE-ON.
As a preposition itintroduces a non-emphatic realization of the actant.
"It" as a complement of "on" is identified as the'goal of PLACE-ON' of the 'write'-situation.
As apronoun it refers to an antecedent which had beenrealized emphatically.
In this case this is the subject ofthe sentence.
Thus, a reference identity of anaphoraand antecedent is constructed, and then both expres-sions refer to the reference object which denotes the'goal of PLACE-ON' of the ' write'-situation.In terms of feature structures the result can be ex-pressed in the following way:\[ sent:praed: \[ hassubje: \[ paperre\['."

It has been derived by applying instantiationrules to the propositional part of the conceptual de-scription and by selecting the presupposition.
Rela-tionships to other layers of text representation are de-noted as patti specifications (<>).3 EXPLANATION OF THE RESULTINGCONCEPTUAL DEFINITIONThe value of the feature 'inst' can be regarded asthe conceptual definition of "blank".
The meaningparaphrase, however, does not really explain"blank".
It rather explains what it means lor some-thing to be blank.
So, the conceptual definition ac-quired can be regarded as a rule for composing the ad-jective's meaning and a noun's meaning, if one takesmeaning paraphrases a rule descriptions.
The rulecovers conventionalized readings of "blank" (thissupports an observation described in \[Boguraev/Pus-tejovsky 90\]).
Used in texts, however, these readingsundergo further changes (cf.
\[Haenelt 92\]).
So, e.g.
aword can stepwise be related to a complex concept ina text and then be used as a term.4 CONCLUSIONIn this paper a method has been described fortransforming the conceptual information of a traditio-nal meaning dictionary by means of textual model-ling into a suitable representation for automatic se-mantic text processing.
The concept definitions ac-quired can be used for content and text structure ba~dretrieval (i.e.
access to concepts or relevant text pas-sages) or for the update of the dictionary (cf.
\[Firzlaff/Haenelt 92\]).
The method proposed is also used forautomatic text analysis, and although it requires a ba-sic set of dictionary entries to be transformed bymanual analysis, its goal is to allow for an automaticcontinuation of this transformation.
So, if the basicvocabulary of meaning paraphrases has been ac-quired it should be possible to analyze the majority ofmeaning paraphrases automatically.
The conceptualdefinitions acquired from meaning paraphrases thencan serve as a basis for analyzing further descriptivetexts uch as e.g.
encyclopedias.
In this sense the me-thod described in this paper is meant to be a contribu-tion towatvls the automatic bootstrapping of know-ledge base construction.5 REFERENCES\[Alshawi 87\] Alshawi, Hiyan: txrocessing Dictionary Defi-nitions with Phrasal Pattern Hierarchies.
