Theoretical Evaluation of Estimation Methods for Data-Oriented ParsingWillem ZuidemaInstitute for Logic, Language and ComputationUniversity of AmsterdamPlantage Muidergracht 24, 1018 TV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.jzuidema@science.uva.nlAbstractWe analyze estimation methods for Data-Oriented Parsing, as well as the theoret-ical criteria used to evaluate them.
Weshow that all current estimation methodsare inconsistent in the ?weight-distributiontest?, and argue that these results force usto rethink both the methods proposed andthe criteria used.1 IntroductionStochastic Tree Substitution Grammars (hence-forth, STSGs) are a simple generalization of Prob-abilistic Context Free Grammars, where the pro-ductive elements are not rewrite rules but elemen-tary trees of arbitrary size.
The increased flexibil-ity allows STSGs to model a variety of syntacticand statistical dependencies, using relatively com-plex primitives but just a single and extremely sim-ple global rule: substitution.
STSGs can be seen asStochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars without theadjunction operation.STSGs are the underlying formalism of most in-stantiations of an approach to statistical parsingknown as ?Data-Oriented Parsing?
(Scha, 1990;Bod, 1998).
In this approach the subtrees of thetrees in a tree bank are used as elementary trees ofthe grammar.
In most DOP models the grammarused is an STSGwith, in principle, all subtrees1 ofthe trees in the tree bank as elementary trees.
Fordisambiguation, the best parse tree is taken to bethe most probable parse according to the weightsof the grammar.Several methods have been proposed to decideon the weights based on observed tree frequencies1A subtree t?
of a parse tree t is a tree such that every nodei?
in t?
equals a node i in t, and i?
either has no daughters orthe same daughter nodes as i.in a tree bank.
The first such method is now knownas ?DOP1?
(Bod, 1993).
In combination withsome heuristic constraints on the allowed subtrees,it has been remarkably successful on small treebanks.
Despite this empirical success, (Johnson,2002) argued that it is inadequate because it is bi-ased and inconsistent.
His criticism spearheadeda number of other methods, including (Bonnemaet al, 1999; Bod, 2003; Sima?an and Buratto,2003; Zollmann and Sima?an, 2005), and will bethe starting point of our analysis.
As it turns out,the DOP1 method really is biased and inconsis-tent, but not for the reasons Johnson gives, and itreally is inadequate, but not because it is biasedand inconsistent.
In this note, we further show thatalternative methods that have been proposed, onlypartly remedy the problems with DOP1, leavingweight estimation as an important open problem.2 Estimation MethodsThe DOP model and STSG formalism are de-scribed in detail elsewhere, for instance in (Bod,1998).
The main difference with PCFGs is thatmultiple derivations, using elementary trees witha variety of sizes, can yield the same parse tree.The probability of a parse p is therefore given by:P (p) =?d:d?=p P (d), where d?
is the tree derivedby derivation d, P (d) = ?t?d w(t) and w(t) givesthe weights of elementary trees t, which are com-bined in the derivation d (here treated as a multi-set).2.1 DOP1In Bod?s original DOP implementation (Bod,1993; Bod, 1998), henceforth DOP1, the weightsof an elementary tree t is defined as its relativefrequency (relative to other subtrees with the sameroot label) in the tree bank.
That is, the weight183wi = w(ti) of an elementary tree ti is given by:wi =fi?j:r(tj)=r(ti)(fj), (1)where fi = f(ti) gives the frequency of subtree tiin a corpus, and r(ti) is the root label of ti.In his critique of this method, (Johnson, 2002)considers a situation where there is an STSG G(the target grammar) with a specific set of sub-trees (t1 .
.
.
tN ) and specific values of the weights(w1 .
.
.
wN ) .
He evaluates an estimation proce-dure which produces a grammar G?
(the estimatedgrammar), by looking at the difference betweenthe weights of G and the expected weights of G?.Johnson?s test for consistency is thus based oncomparing the weight-distributions between targetgrammar and estimated grammar2.
I will thereforerefer to this test as the ?weight-distribution test?.t1 = SAaAat2 =SAaAt3 =SA Aat5 =SAat4 =SA At6 =SAt7 =AaFigure 1: The example of (Johnson, 2002)(Johnson, 2002) looks at an example grammarG ?
STSG with the subtrees as in figure 1.
John-son considers the case where the weights of alltrees of the target grammar G are 0, except forw7, which is necessarily 1, and w4 and w6 whichare w4 = p and w6 = 1 ?
p. He finds that theexpected values of the weights w4 and w6 of theestimated grammar G?
are:E[w?4] =p2 + 2p, (2)E[w?6] =1 ?
p2 + 2p, (3)which are not equal to their target values for allvalues of p where 0 < p < 1.
This analysisthus shows that DOP1 is unable to recover the trueweights of the given STSG, and hence the incon-sistency of the estimator with respect to the classof STSGs.Although usually cited as showing the inad-equacy of DOP1, Johnson?s example is in fact2More precisely, it is based on evaluating the estimator?sbehavior for any weight-distribution possible in the STSGmodel.
(Prescher et al, 2003) give a more formal treatmentof bias and consistency in the context of DOP.not suitable to distinguish DOP1 from alternativemethods, because no possible estimation proce-dure can recover the true weights in the case con-sidered.
In the example there are only two com-plete trees that can be observed in the trainingdata, corresponding to the trees t1 and t5.
It iseasy to see that when generating examples withthe grammar in figure 1, the relative frequencies3f1 .

f4 of the subtrees t1 .

t4 must all be thesame, and equal to the frequency of the completetree t1 which can be composed in the followingways from the subtrees in the original grammar:t1 = t2 ?
t7 = t3 ?
t7 = t4 ?
t7 ?
t7.
(4)It follows that the expected frequencies of each ofthese subtrees are:E[f1] = E[f2] = E[f3] = E[f4] (5)= w1 + w2w7 + w3w7 + w4w7w7Similarly, the other frequencies are given by:E[f5] = E[f6] = w5 + w6w7 (6)E[f7] = 2 (w1 + w2w7 + w3w7+w4w7w7) + w5 + w6w7= 2E[f1] + E[f5].
(7)From these equations it is immediately clearthat, regardless of the amount of training data,the problem is simply underdetermined.

w6 (w7 = 1) given only2 frequencies f1 and f5 (and the constraint that?6i=1(fi) = 1) are not uniquely defined, and nopossible estimation method will be able to reliablyrecover the true weights.The relevant test is whether for all possibleSTSGs and in the limit of infinite data, the ex-pected relative frequencies of trees given the es-timated grammar, equal the observed relative fre-quencies.
I will refer to this test as the ?frequency-distribution test?.
As it turns out, the DOP1method also fails this more lenient test.
The easi-est way to show this, using again figure 1, is as fol-lows.
The weights w?1 .

w?7 of grammar G?
will ?by definition ?
be set to the relative frequencies ofthe corresponding subtrees:w?i ={ fiP6j=1 fjfor i = 1 .
.
.
61 for i = 7.
(8)3Throughout this paper I take frequencies fi to be relativeto the size of the corpus.184The grammar G?
will thus produce the completetrees t1 and t5 with expected frequencies:E[f ?1] = w?1 + w?2w?7 + w?3w?7 + w?4w?7w?7= 4 f1?6j=1 fj(9)E[f ?5] = w?5 + w?6w?7 = 2f5?6j=1 fj.
(10)Now consider the two possible complete treest1 and t5, and the fraction of their frequenciesf1/f5.
In the estimated grammar G?
this fractionbecomes:E[f ?1]E[f ?5]=4n f1P6j=1 fj2n f5P6j=1 fj= 2f1f5.
(11)That is, in the limit of infinite data, the estima-tion procedure not only ?understandably?
fails tofind the target grammar amongst the many gram-mars that could have produced the observed fre-quencies, it in fact chooses a grammar that couldnever have produced these observed frequenciesat all.
This example shows the DOP1 method isbiased and inconsistent for the STSG class in thefrequency-distribution test4.2.2 Correction-factor approachesBased on similar observation, (Bonnema et al,1999; Bod, 2003) propose alternative estimationmethods, which involve a correction factor tomove probability mass from larger subtrees tosmaller ones.
For instance, Bonnema et al replaceequation (1) with:wi = 2?N(ti)fi?j:r(tj)=r(ti)(fj), (12)where N(ti) gives the number of internal nodesin ti (such that 2?N(ti) is inversely proportionalto the number of possible derivations of ti).
Sim-ilarly, (Bod, 2003) changes the way frequenciesfi are counted, with a similar effect.
This ap-proach solves the specific problem shown in equa-tion (11).
However, the following example showsthat the correction-factor approaches cannot solvethe more general problem.4Note that there are settings of the weights w1 .

w7 thatgenerate a frequency-distribution that could also have beengenerated with a PCFG.
The example given applies to suchdistribution as well, and therefore also shows the inconsis-tency of the DOP1 method for PCFG distributions.t1 = SAaAbt2 = SAbAat3 = SAaAat4 = SAbAbt5 =SAaAt6 =SA Abt7 =SAbAt8 =SA Aat9 =SA At10 =Aat11 =AbFigure 2: Counter-example to the correction-factor approachesConsider the STSG in figure 2.
The expectedfrequencies f1 .

f11 are again simple com-binations of the frequencies f1 .

f4.
Observa-tions of these frequencies therefore do not addany extra information, and the problem of find-ing the weights of the target grammar is in generalagain underdetermined.
But consider the situationwhere f3 = f4 = 0 and f1 > 0 and f2 > 0.This constrains the possible solutions enormously.If we solve the following equations for w3 .
.
.
w11with the constraint that probabilities with the sameroot label add up to 1: (i.e.
?9i=1(wi) = 1,w10 + w11 = 1):w3 + w5w10 + w8w10 + w9w10w10 = 0w4 + w6w11 + w7w11 + w9w11w11 = 0,we find, in addition to the obvious w3 = w4 = 0,the following solutions: w10 = w6 = w7 = w9 =0 ?
w11 = w5 = w8 = w9 = 0 ?
w5 =w6 = w7 = w8 = w9 = 0.
That is, if we ob-serve no occurrences of trees t3 and t4 in the train-ing sample, we know that at least one subtree ineach derivation of these strings must have weightzero.
However, any estimation method that usesthe (relative) frequencies of subtrees and a (non-zero) correction factor that is based on the size ofthe subtrees, will give non-zero probabilities to allweights w5 .

In other words, these weight estimationmethods for STSGs are also biased and inconsis-tent in the frequency-distribution test.1852.3 Shortest derivation estimatorsBecause the STSG formalism allows elementarytrees of arbitrary size, every parse tree in a treebank could in principle be incorporated in anSTSG grammar.
That is, we can define a trivialestimator with the following weights:wi ={fi if ti is an observed parse tree0 otherwise(14)Such an estimator is not particularly interesting,because it does not generalize beyond the trainingdata.
It is a point to note, however, that this esti-mator is unbiased and consistent in the frequency-distribution test.
(Prescher et al, 2003) prove thatany unbiased estimator that uses the ?all subtrees?representation has the same property, and con-clude that lack of bias is not a desired property.
(Zollmann and Sima?an, 2005) propose an esti-mator based on held-out estimation.
The trainingcorpus is split into an estimation corpus EC and aheld out corpus HC .
The HC corpus is parsedby searching for the shortest derivation of eachsentence, using only fragments from EC .
Theelementary trees of the estimated STSG are as-signed weights according to their usage frequen-cies u1, .
.
.
, uN in these shortest derivations:wi =ui?j:r(tj)=r(ti) uj.
(15)This approach solves the problem with bias de-scribed above, while still allowing for consistency,as Zollmann & Sima?an prove.
However, theirproof only concerns consistency in the frequency-distribution test.
As the corpus EC grows to beinfinitely large, every parse tree in HC will alsobe found in EC , and the shortest derivation willtherefore in the limit only involve a single ele-mentary tree: the parse tree itself.
Target STSGswith non-zero weights on smaller elementary treeswill thus not be identified correctly, even with aninfinitely large training set.
In other words, theZollmann & Sima?an method, and other methodsthat converge to the ?complete parse tree?
solutionsuch as LS-DOP (Bod, 2003) and BackOff-DOP(Sima?an and Buratto, 2003), are inconsistent inthe weight-distribution test.3 Discussion & ConclusionsA desideratum for parameter estimation methodsis that they converge to the correct parameters withinfinitely many data ?
that is, we like an estima-tor to be consistent.
The STSG formalism, how-ever, allows for many different derivations of thesame parse tree, and for many different grammarsto generate the same frequency-distribution.
Con-sistency in the weight-distribution test is there-fore too stringent a criterion.
We have shown thatDOP1 and methods based on correction factorsalso fail the weaker frequency-distribution test.However, the only current estimation methodsthat are consistent in the frequency-distributiontest, have the linguistically undesirable propertyof converging to a distribution with all probabil-ity mass in complete parse trees.
Although thesemethod fail the weight-distribution test for thewhole class of STSGs, we argued earlier that thistest is not the appropriate test either.
Both estima-tion methods for STSGs and the criteria for eval-uating them, thus require thorough rethinking.
Inforthcoming work we therefore study yet anotherestimator, and the linguistically motivated evalua-tion criterion of convergence to a maximally gen-eral STSG consistent with the training data5.ReferencesRens Bod.
