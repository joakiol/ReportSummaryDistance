Proceedings of the Second Workshop on NLP Challenges in the Information Explosion Era (NLPIX 2010), page 1,Beijing, August 2010Query Understanding in Web Search- by Large Scale Log Data Mining and Statistical LearningHang LiMicrosoft Research Asia, ChinaAbstractQuery understanding is an important component of web search, like document understanding,query document matching, ranking, and user understanding.
The goal of query understanding isto predict the user?s search intent from the given query.
Needless to say, search log mining andstatistical learning are fundamental technologies to address the task of query understanding.
Inthis talk, I will first introduce a large-scale search log mining platform which we have devel-oped at MSRA.
I will then explain our approach to query understanding, as well as documentunderstanding, query document matching, and user understanding.
After that, I will describe indetails about our methods for query understanding based on statistical learning.
They includequery refinement using CRF, named entity recognition in query using topic model, contextaware query topic prediction using HMM.This is joint work with Gu Xu, Daxin Jiang and other collaborators.1
