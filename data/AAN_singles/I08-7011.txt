A Semantic Study on Yami Ontology in Traditional SongsYin-Sheng Tai                D. Victoria Rau               Meng-Chien YangProvidence University,          Providence University,        Providence University,Taiwan                                  Taiwan                                Taiwanwratp2@msn.com                dhrau@pu.edu.tw            mcyang2@pu.edu.twAbstractThe  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  provide  anexample of how to build a Yami ontology fromtraditional  songs  by  employing  Prot?g?,  anopen-source  tool for  editing  and  managingontologies developed  by  Stanford  University.Following  Conceptual  Blending  Theory(Fauconnier  and Turner, 1998),  we found thatYami  people use the  conceptual  metaphor  of?fishing?
in traditional songs when praising thehost?s diligence  in  a ceremony  celebrating thecompletion  of  a  workhouse.
The  process  ofbuilding ontologies  is explored and illustrated.The  proposed construction of  an ontology forYami  traditional  songs  can  serve  as  afundamental  template,  using  the corpusavailable online from the Yami documentationwebsite  (http://yamiproject.cs.pu.edu.tw/yami)to build ontologies for other domains.1 IntroductionYami is an endangered Austronesian language,spoken on  Orchid  Island (Lanyu),  46  kilometerssoutheast  of  the  main  island  of  Taiwan.
For  thepurposes of  language  documentation andpreservation, an on-line Yami dictionary1 has beendeveloped to facilitate language learning.
Althougheach  lexical  entry contains  basic  meanings  ofwords  (in  both  English  and  Chinese),pronunciations,  and  roots  and  affixes, noinformation  on  lexical  semantics,  such  assynonyms, hyponyms, or metaphors is available.
Ifinformation  on  lexical  relationships could  beincorporated into  the Yami dictionary,  this onlinetool would be even more useful for Yami languagelearners.In  the  present  study,  we  focused  on  themetaphors in Yami lyrics.
Knight (2005) considersthat,  from a Yami native speaker?s point of  view,1  Available from the following IP address:http://yamiproject.cs.pu.edu.tw/elearn/search.php?Raods?
(traditional songs) play an important rolein culture because they subsume features such asarchaism, metaphors, puns and polite contradiction.In  addition,  Yami  traditonal  songs  reflect  Yamivalues, such as love and honoring hard work (e.g.fishing or farm work), and cultural events, such ascompletion  of  hard  work  and  special  festivals.Thus,  we  would  like  to  build  an  ontology  usingYami traditional songs, adapting the taxonomies inWordNet and SUMO, which can serve as a point ofdeparture  for  further  mapping  of other  Yamiontologies.
In  this  paper,  we  will  report  ourpreliminary  results,  giving  one  example  at  thisearly stage of the research project on constructingYami  ontology,  led  by  the  second  and  thirdauthors.2  Literature Review2.1 Conceptual Metaphor TheoryThe original Conceptual Metaphor Theory wasproposed  by  Lakoff  and  Johnson (1980).
Theyidentify metaphor as a transfer between the sourcedomain and  the  target domain.
This  has  becomeknown as the ?two-domain theory?
of metaphor.2.2 Conceptual Blending TheoryConceptual  Blending Theory (Fauconnier  andTurner, 1998; 2002) is a framework for interpretingcognitive  linguistic  phenomena  such  as  analogy,metaphor, etc.
According to Conceptual  BlendingTheory, the input structures, generic structures, andblend structures in the network are mental spaces.In  Figure  1,  the  frame  structure  recruited  to  themental  space  is  represented  as  a  rectangle  eitheroutside or iconically inside the circle.Figure 1.
Conceptual Blending TheoryThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008812.3  Prot?g?In this study, we are building a Yami ontologybased  on  traditional  songs  using  Prot?g?2,  whichnot  only provides a rich set  of basic knowledge-modeling structures and a way to enter  data,  butcan also  be customized to create new domains inknowledge models.As  demonstrated  in  previous  studies  (e.g.,Dodds,  2005;  Lin  2006),  Prot?g?
has  beensuccessfully applied to construction of ontology inspecific domains.
Therefore, the present study usedProt?g?
to  construct  an  ontology  of Yamitraditional songs.3.
Methodology3.1 Data CollectionThe  main  data  resource  came  from  Dong?smonograph (1994)  ?In  Praise of Taro,?
whichcontains a total of 250 songs.
This study is basedon  one  song  which  contains  many  fishingmetaphors.
Seven metaphorical  tokens  wereextracted from this song.3.2 Data AnalysisFirst of all, the question of the use of metaphorin  Yami  was  analyzed  by  Lakoff  &  Johnson?sConceptual  Metaphor  Theory  (1980)  andFauconnier and  Turner?s  Conceptual  BlendingTheory  (1998).
Secondly,  two taxonomic tenorswere  identified  using WordNet (Fellbaum,  1999)and Yami  Texts  with  Reference  Grammar  andDictionary (Rau & Dong,  2006).
Based on thesetaxonomic tenors, Yami words were classified into?Verbs?
and ?Nouns?.4.
Results and Discussion4.1 Conceptual BlendingIn the following discussion, we begin with ananalysis of a traditional Yami song celebrating thecompletion of a workhouse with a harvest of taro.It  mostly  praises  the  host?s  achivement and hardwork.
After  praising  the  host?s  achivement,  theguests take all the host?s taros and cover the roof ofthe workhouse with them.
Finally, the guests singsongs with the host in turn.The lyric is illustrated as follows:1 oya   rana    minangyid  siapen      rarakehthis already  reached_the_harbor grandfather old2  Prot?g?

?Now, the old man reached the harbor.
?2 ji    na       minatokod Jicamongan  taNEG already  reached     PLN       because?He didn?t paddle to Jicamongan.
?3 kalagarawan     am   paneneneban  o     ...fingerling_place  TOP  shallow_sea   NOM  ...?He moved in the shallow sea where only fingerlingfish live.
?4 to    na      rana  avavangi   sia  taAUX 3.S.GEN already row a boat there because?He could only row his boat there?5 ji   na      rana    voaz  o    kakaodNEG 3.S.GEN already  row  NOM  paddle?Because he had already lost strength to row.
?Seven metaphorical tokens  related to ?fishing?were detected from the lyric.
They are marked inbold  case.
In  Line  1, minangyid ?reached  theharbor?
was  identified  as  metaphorical  becausealthough  it  literally  describes  going  back  homeafter finishing one?s fishing, its intended meaningis  ?to  rest  and  hold  a  ceremony  celebrating thecompletion of a workhouse.?
Using the ConceptualMetaphor  Theory (1980),  we  compared  thecognitive  activities  in  the  lyrics  and  the  mentalspace (Table 1).
The entities, quality, and functionsin the domain of fishing were analyzed.Table 1.
Reached the harbor vs. Holding aceremony celebrating the completion of aworkhouseTable 1 shows that Yami people prefer to use?fishing?
as a metaphor for the intended meaningsof  building  a  house  or  farming.
We  furtheremployed the Conceptual  Blending  Theory (1998)to interpret the ?harbor?
example (see Figure 2).The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200882Figure 2.
?Reached the harbor?
vs. ?Holding aceremony celebrating the completion of aworkhouse?The  concept  of ?reached  the  harbor?
iscategorized  into  Input  space  I,  and  ?holding aceremony  celebrating the  completion  of  aworkhouse?
is categorized into Input space II.
BothInputs  have certain similarities as well as distinctfeatures.
From Input Space I, ?fisherman,?
?boat,??fish,?
?harbor,?
and ?to  share  his  achievementsand  honor  with  his  friends  and  relatives?
arerespectively  mapped  into  ?host/builder,?
?newworkhouse,?
?taro,?
?yard,?
and  ?to  share  hisachievements  and  honor  with  his  friends  andrelatives,?
in  Input  Space  II.
The  Inputs  mightshare some cross-mapping properties, which can belisted in the Generic space.
The structure from thetwo input mental spaces is projected into the Blendspace.
Essentially,  which elements  from  Inputspace II should be selected and projected onto theblend space  are determined by the contents of  thelyric.
Thus, in the blend space, all elements remainseparate from their corresponding counterparts, butthe relations among  the features in Input  space Idetermines the relations  between correspondingcounterparts.
That is to say, the running structure inthe  blend  space  partially  projected  from  Inputspace I determines the existing relations among theelements  in  the  blend.
In  Input space I, a?fisherman?
needs a ?boat?
to fish in the ocean, sothe relation between ?fisherman?
and ?boat?
is  akind  of  ?earning a  living.?
In  addition,  what  a?fisherman?
works for  is  ?fish.?
After  thefisherman finishes his work,  he has to  go back tothe harbor.
Such relations also operate among thoseelements projected from Input space II.
As a result,?the  host  of  the  completion  ceremony  of  aworkhouse?
is  the  ?fisherman?
of  the  ?workhouseceremony;?
the relation between ?the host?
and the?workhouse ceremony?
is that of ?finishing a time-consuming job.?
Additionally,  ?taros?
in the yardare  compared  with ?fish?
at  the harbor,  whichawait to be ?shared with friends and relatives.
?4.2  TaxonomyYami verbs subsume dynamic verbs and stativeverbs (Rau and Dong, 2006).
Based on the notionsfrom  WordNet, we  further  divided  verbs  intoBodily  Function  and Care  Verbs, Change Verbs,Communication Verbs, Competition Verbs,Consumption  Verbs,  Contact  Verbs,  CognitionVerbs,  Creation Verbs,  Motion Verbs,  Emotion orPsych  Verbs,  Stative  Verbs,  Perception  Verbs,Possession  Verbs, Social  Interaction  Verbs,  andWeather  Verbs.
Since  Yami  does  not  possess  adistinctive  adjective word  class,  both  descriptiveand relational adjectives are in this study classifiedunder  stative  verbs  in  WordNet.
Descriptiveadjectives subsume  antonymy,  gradation,markedness, polysemy and selectional preferences,reference-modifying  adjectives,  color  adjectives,quantifiers,  and  participial  adjectives.
Relationaladjectives include  two  domains,  ?pertaining?
or?relating to?
(Fellbaum 1999: 63).
The coding ofadjectives  in  this  file  is  different  from  that  ofdescriptive adjectives.
Rather than being part of acluster, each synset is entered individually, so thatthe  interface  will  present  the  adjective  with  itsrelated noun and information about the sense of thenoun.For the aspect of Yami Nouns, we categorizedthe nouns into 10 basic noun  categories followingWordNet (Fellbaum,  1999:  30),  including  entity,abstraction,  psycho-feature,  natural  phenomena,activity,  event,  group,  location,  possession, andstate.4.3  Example from the Yami LyricThe  following  example  illustrates  how  weextracted the metaphorical words of ?fishing?
fromthe lyric and classfied them into their domains.Firstly, minangyid ?reached the harbor,?
avavangi?row, sail something?
and  voaz ?row something,?were  classified  as Motion  Verbs.
Secondly,Jicamongan ?a  place  name  of  deep water,?kalagarawan ?a place where fingerling fish swim?and  paneneneban ?shallow place,?
werecategorized under  the  main  section  Location  andThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200883the sub-section Sea.
Finally, kakaod ?
paddle?
wasclassified in the main section Entity and the sub-section Artifact, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.Figure 3.

SinceInput space I usually works as the source domainand Input space II as  the  target domain, we foundthat, at least in this case, this is a one-sided networkof  metaphor mapping.
We  thus  employed  theproperty  ?mappings?
to  define  the  relationshipbetween ?reached the harbor?
and ?to hold a newworkhouse celebration.?
Moreover, in order to setup the restrictions for searching words, we addedthe property ?hasConceptOf?.
We then named theclass expression of ?reached the harbor?
with thefollowing restriction:has_concept_of some3 (harbor and4 fish andfisherman and boat and share)Similarly, we also provided the phrase ?to holda new workhouse celebration?
with the followingrestriction:has_concept_of some (host and builder andworkhouse and share and taro and yard)Finally, for  the  sake  of  correctly  linking3  This refers to the existential quantifier ( ) in OWLsyntax, which can be read as at least one, or some.4 An intersection class is described by combining two ormore classes using the AND operator ( ).meanings of each word, the ontology builder cancheck  the  ontology  with  the  DL  Query  Tab  inProt?g?.In summary,  the  connection between the  twoitems minangyid, ?reached the harbor?
and ?to holda new workhouse celebration,?
shown in shadow inFigure  4,  is  solely  based  on  the  structure  of  theinputs,  since  each  of  them  are  from  a  differentdomain of verbs.
This structure is in harmony withYami custom and contextual structure.5  ConclusionThis paper has provided an example of how toconstruct  an  ontology  of Yami  using  traditionalsongs.
We  hope  this  approach  will  serve  as  afundamental  template for further  mappings  withmore texts to produce other Yami ontologies.ReferencesDodds, D. 2005.
