Drawing in-ferences from the context can be ameans for resolving semantic ambigu-ities.
However, often, this is an ex-.pensive strategy that, in addition, notalways comes up with a clear prefer-ence for one of the alternatives.
Inthis paper, we argue that in a num-ber of cases deep semantic analyses canbe avoided by taking into account theconstraints that the alternative readingsimpose onto the information structure.To this end, we present a study of thearnbigous German adverb erst and pointout the particular circumstances underwhich the given information structuredisambiguates the adverb without fur-ther semantic analysis.1 I n t roduct ionGerman erst is ambigous.
Consider the followingexamples:(1) Peter zeigte erst auf die vierte Gliickszahl.a) Und dann auf die zweite.
(Peter first pointed to the fourth lucky number.And then to the second.

'rheexample testifies the following three uses of crsl:?
In the context (1.a), the recipient under-stands the introduced event as the first ofa sequence of events that he expects to becompleted by the following text.
We call thisreading:the First of a Sequence-reading (FS).?
In the context (1.b), the recipient under-stands erst as a signal of the speaker/writerthat the occurrence of the reported event isnot preceded by the occurrence of similar (al-ternative) events.
We call this reading:the Exclusion of Preceding Alternatives-reading (EPA).?
In the context (1.c), the recipient under-stands the event as element of a sequence ofevents, and the realization of the sequence,in particular the reported realization of theevent at the textual perspective time, seemsto be in retardation, with regard to some(previous) expectation about the realizationdates of the sequence.
We call this reading:the Retardation-reading (R).As can be seen from the example, the contextualdisambiguation not only is needed for understand-ing the text, but is a prerequisite for high qualitytranslation.In the literature, different lbrmalizations havebeen discussed ((KSn79), (LSb89), (Kgn91),(HR81) (the latter one for the similar noch andschon) and others).
With respect o the focus ad-verb use (the cases (1.b) and (1.c); (1.a) beingan example of the temporal adverb use), rnod-ellings are prevailing that associate rs* with dif-ferent scales (cf.
(I~5b89)).
However, a preciseevaluation of the context that can decide aboutthe relevant reading (for instance, what infor-mation defines which scale) is still missing.
Wetackle this problem in the framework of DiscourseRepresentation Theory (DRT) (Kam81), assum-ing that discourse representations (DRSs) may beaugmented by information structure.3342 The cr.d.-readings, theirentai lments, presupposit ions andimplicatures2.1 The  l,'irst of a ,%qucuce intert)re, ta t ionI l l this paper, we cmmu)t go into detail with teststhat partit ion tile meaning of a sentence into pre-sui)positions , assertions proper and inlplicaturesthe recipient is allowed to drmw from the sentence(of.

We directly come up withtile I)RSs that, to our opinion, represc.nt he im-pact of the different remdings.

With respect to the represen-tation and resolution of presuppositions in DR/F,we relate to (vdS92).
We slightly deviate fromthe approach suggested there, however, in thatwe use a notation for the llresui)position triggersthat is akin to the suggestion o f (BgS  + 94): we useso-calle<\[ ~-condilions which describe the presup-posed objects and their characterization.

The relation Rhas to be understood as characterizing the e i asopportunities for Peter to point to (specific) num-bers.
In (1), these opportunities may be situationsthat Call be described by: The firsle~ / second~ /lhird~ number is presented to Peter.
Tile order ofthe oppertunities i inherited from the order of thePs, -<o, which conforms to the intrinsic order ofthe set of Mternatives of the focused element (i.e.O=order(ALT(FOC~.I(DI~S~)))).
In (1), this isthe canonical order of the numbers.The negation test, which is comlnonly used todetect presuppositions, upports these strueturMassumptions.Now, we think that the EPA-reading inter-pretes tile asserted event, which is backed by thedescribed scenario, as the lirst one that; is indeedrealized within the range of possible instantiationsthat the sequence of opportunities provides, i.e.the asserted event presents the first positive out-come to tile test about the instantiation of theAe.BAC(DRS~)-type that is connected to the ei-sequence, where each test situation el is charac-terized by its own specific additional test criterionkx.
F O(;(1) I?Se )\[41n\] '2Further linguistic tests, that we must omithere, support the assumption that the informationabout the negative tests is an entailment.
There-fore, in the representation, the negated DRSs forthe pointing-opportunit ies l - e3 are part of themain DRS.In the literature the representation of the fo-('using use of ersl (and corresponding uses of nochand schon) often comprises the information thattile reported reMization of the event is earlier orlater (depending on the reading and the adverb)than the speaker/writer and/or  the recipient (oreven a third person) would have expected.
Wethink that such an expectation, in the case ofthe EPA-reading of erst, is only optional.
Fol-lowing (K6n91), we think that, if present, it is nota presupposition but a conventional implicature.In (1.b), we use the specific c~i,,~,l-format and therepresentation convention of (Ram95) for attitudi-nal states in order to express the EPA-expectationof a previous test to be successful.2.3 The  Retardation i n te rpreta t ionAs for the EPA-reading, we consider the casewhere tile numeral is focussed only:2Depending on the tocus structure of tile phrase inthe scope of erst in (1) and depending on the contex-tuM restrictions of the admissible alternatives, othersets of Ps might result.
It is clear that dependingon this choice, the focus conditions may characterizea thematic role., as in the described example, or theevent wriable.
It is ~dso clear, as we will argue in thenext section, that not all of these sets of alternativescan accept the El~A-reading.

~ :A'PT(~ <lt  \],:L, I~*l > 4 )In contrast to the EPA-reading, we assume that,in the R-reading, the predicates Pi that we ob-tain from the information structure of the erst-argument are not related to a sequence of opportu-nities for doing something, but describe events eiof an expectation about the ongoing of the worldor a plan e. The context (1) doesn't provide fin:-tiler information about the identity of the personor persons X to whom the introduced attitudinalstate has to be ascribed, to the speaker/writer, tothe recipient, to Peter, to someone lse or to somegroup of salient people.
Also it doesn't provide in-formation about the nature of the att itude MOI).The conditions that are introduced below the clot-ted line exemplify possible resolutions.
Accordingto this, Peter and the speaker/writer (i for thedistinguished I)I{.F for the self) share the attitud(;of having a plan for realizing //.
Such resolutionsmay be available by an inference component thatoperates over richer contextual knowledge.
Ag~fin,tile order of the Pi and tile corresponding ei is in-ferred from the implicit or(ler of the alternativesof the focused element, l,'rom this setting andthe assertion of an occurrence of Peter pointingto the fourth lucky number at the temporal per-spective t, the representation entails reMizationsof those events of the presupposition line thatprecede the counterpart of e in the presupposedsequence.
As a further (possibly optionM) con-strain|;, the l~-reading introduces the implicaturethat a noi~ further specified person or grout) ~ cx-336petted h)r the perst)ective time t that the plamtcdor expected sequence of events shouhl be realizedto a greater degree.
Without further informationabout the identity of ~, it is ditllcult to say some-thing more precise about the temporM location ofthe ~-expectation than that an instance s' of thecorresponding attitudinal state holds at some timeI)efore the actual now.3 Disarnbiguating Criteria3.1 T im Syntax  Cr i te r ionIn (.
;crman focus adverl)s cannot be topicMized assuch, i.e.
they cannot occur in the vorfeld po-sition without an accompanying constituent (cf.(KSn!)

its meaning can only be theli'S-reading, as exemplitied by (2):(2) Erst g'ab Peter Maria den Brief.

There are suggestions of analysingfocus adverbs as syntactic o-coustituents of theirfeet, and there, are suggestions for analysing themonly as co-(:onstitu(mts o\[' the verb or its pro-jections (see (Bay85), (Bay88), (,lac89), (.lac84),(K5,,91) among others for a discussion).
We havenothing sf)eciiic, to say about this here.
We justnote that, under the conuno,, assuml)tion that thevorfeld in (h'.rmau introduces at most one con-stituent and under the ensuing assuml)tion that\['ocus adverbs modify tht'ir loci, in sente.nc(;s like(3), crsl must 1)e interpret('d as focus adverl).

thatrood|lies a verbal projection of similar tense andin lbl'mation strut:tm:('~ as th(: crsl-argument.

;I)A-sccnario the |)ackground event type is testedfor specitic reMizations, it is natural to think ofthis scenario to be reasonably con(:eptualizt~d oulyif the, I)ackg;rouud eveut type merits testing.
Thisis not  the case it ~ there is no background event I;ypeat all (i.e.

There, is no backgrouud ew'nttype if the entire argument of erst - the verb or averbM projection - is in focus, or, though not infocus, the verb does not curry enough substance inorder to provide an event type: this is the case forthe COl)ula without; the t)redicativc ('olrtl)\]elneHl..Instead of technically working out l,he criterion,we content ourselves with sore(; motivating exam-pies whi('h are critical in this resl)ect.

Without fllrther comment, we thiukthat the criterion is cent|trot'x\[ by the data.l"ocns- 13ackgr(mnd-cr\] terion :The F,l~A-reading is ac('(;l~tM)h~ only if the SCOl)Cof c, rst is structured into focus and bac.kgrouml insuch a way that the background is a specitic eventtype.3.3 The  T( :nqmral  Locat ion  Crlte.r i(m'l'he R-reading i)resul)poses a sequence of events(concel)tuMized as a plan or an expectation aboutthe ongoing of the world) and it assumes that,fl'om the t)erspective of the contextual l)ersl)eCl, ivetime, a part of the sequence is reMized, at.cordingto the ordering of the plan or expectation.
Therel)orted event refers to the event of the presul)l)Osition line that marks the boundary l)(%wcen theinstantiated nnd tire nol>instantiated event cou-cepts, and it; does this in right the satlle way asdelinite descriptions do with resl)ect to their ml-tecedents.
Now, if this is true and it' the ev(ml;descrit)tion contains a teml,orM location hi t.hcfocus, this information cannot be used att,' ibutively, because it contributes to the antecedenL de337scription and to the distinction of this antecedentfi'om its alternatives.
Because of this setting, itacts as a restriction on the referring expressionthat helps to pick up the right antecedent fromthe presupposition line.
This means that, againstthe background of the presupposition, this in-formation is not new.
We add that nothing ofthe ersgargument is new information against hisbackground.
New is the information about theprogress of the instantiation of the presupposedevent concepts.
But then, stating that an eventof the corresponding antecedent type indeed wasrealized (the assertional impact of the R-reading),and stating that it occurred at a time as was ex-pected (consequence of the specific description of'antecedent' and 'anaphor'),  and simultaneouslyinsinuating that it could have been realized earlier(presuppositional structure of the R-reading sup-ported by intplicature) results in a contradiction.This, to our opinion, seems to be the explanationof why the I{-reading is not possible in case thedescription in the scope of erst comes with a tem-poral location in the foens.
Compare the followingexaml>les to this end.
(5) Petra war iiberrascht, wella) Peter erst On \[Stuttgart\]\]+, war) (R)b) Peter erst (urn \[12.00\]v in Stuttgart war)*(R)(5) confirms what we have said so far.
Note, by theway, that the features of the Focus-Backgronnd-criterion are not characteristic of the R-reading.What about temporal locations in the back-ground part?
At first glance, it seems that whatwe have said above applies to this case also.
How=ever, there are some (relatively marginal) casesthat possibly contradict o this assumption.
Thefollowing example (6) is an instance of this:(6) .
.
.
well Peter erst (in \[Mfinchen\]v um 3ein Bier getrunken hat)(be?
:anse only in Munich, Peter drank abeer at tt~ree (so fa~))In a context that; continues this information, forinstance, by und noch nicht in Kb'ln (am ndchsten7'ag) um 3 / and not *,let in (Jolo.qne (lhe next day)al 3 the R-reading seems acceptable.
Because ofthe granularity of the presuppositional event se-quence that develops from the presupposition con-strnction in such cases - in (6), the iteration mustsatisfy to a one-day-rhythm at least- the temporaladjunct cannot truly act, as a restrictive referen-tial constraint, and becanse of what we have saidabove about novelty, it is not the best attributiveinformation also.
This may explain why the ex-ample is felt to be a bit odd.
The decisive feature,however, why the above argumentation for the in-compatibility of the R-reading and the presenceof temporal ocalizations does not go through, isthe fact that the background temporal localizationdoes not uniquely \[ix the occurrence time of theevent with regard to the time fralne of the presup-posed plan or expectation.
This, of course, is so,only if the localizing predicate allows for multiple(periodic) instantiation.
(Times of day allow forthis, also adjuncts like after lunch etc.
).We stress that what we have said relates totemporal adjuncts in t i le scope  of  erst.
Thefollowing (7.a) allows for the R-reading, becausethe most natural analysis gives wide scope to thetemporal adjunct, i.e.
the sentence is analysed like(7.h), where clearly, the adjunct serves to localize,the temporal perspective.
(7) a) Erst in Miinchen war er gestern.b) well er g estern erst in Miin&en war.
(yesterday being in Munich)We have considered only temporal adjuncts sofar.
The alternative temporal localization that oc-curs in the scope of erst is the construction 'COl>=ula + predicative temporal expression', which ac-cepts the R-reading.
Examples are (4.c) and (4.d).We skip the complete xplanatory argument hereand just say that (grosso mode) the function ofthe copula construction is to synchronize calendarknowledge (also information about different calen-dars: R-reading of (4.
(1)) with the actnM avail-able perspective times, whereas the function ofthe temporal adjunct is to relate the descibedevent to some predefined time.
We take it forgranted, that this difference is the reason why thedecisive conflict that we mentioned fllrther abow'~only arises if the temporM location is introducedby modification, i.e.
in case it is introduced by anadjunct.We retain the following criterion:Temporal-Location-criterion:The R-reading is acceptable only if the focus con-stituent of the scope of erst does not contribute atemporal ocalization (by modification of a basicevent type).
In addition, the scope must not con-tain an adjunct - focused or not - that is a uniquelyreferring temporal location (like yesterday).3.4 The  Enta ihnent  Cr i te r ionCompare the following examples:(8) .

*(R),(gI?A).e) Peter erst ( \[vier \]r  Angestellte kannte).(P.

(I{),*(EeA)(8.a) cannot have the R-reading.
Why?
The in-telligent construction of the presuppositional se-quence of events for the H.-reading outputs a num-ber of disqualification events that are located al;particular places of the I lahnenkamm downhillrace in Kitzbfihel.
What is specific with this se-quence is the fact that the postconditions of anyof these events are snch that the preconditions ofthe successive vents never can hold.
Thereforesuch a sequence can never be a reasonable plan or338a reasonable: expectation el)out a <townhil\] race.I.e.
a constitutive lement of the R-reading cannoth(; constructed in this ease.
In (8.1)) the descrip--tions of subsequent events (states in this case) ofthe presuppositional line are more gcnerM predi-cates than the description of the predecessors, i.e,each such sequence collapses in its tirst element inessen<;e. This cannot truly he called a sequence.With (8.c), we encounter, so to speak, the sym-metric picture with regard to the El)A-reading:t(no'wing n employees entails the previous|y testedknowin( t n-\[ cmployccs.

UsingI;he convincing structural interd<:t>endencies thai;(Liib89) shows for a subset of the German focusadverbs containing crsl, the generalization of tireapproach suggested here to other ambiguous ad:verbs seems very promising.Re ferencesJ.
