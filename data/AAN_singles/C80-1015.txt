A MODEL OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGOF T IME-RELATED EXPRESSIONSYutaka KusanagiUNIVERSITY  OF TSUKUBASAKURA-MURA,  IBARAKI, JAPANThis  paper  proposes  a model  ofautomat ic  process ing  of t ime- re la tedexpress ions  by int roduc ing the not ion  offocus in the cogn i t ion  level.
The l in-gu ist ic  categor ies  of t ime aredetermined on the bas is  of the rela-t ionsh ips  among the t ime of an extra-l inguist ic  s ituation, the focused t imeand the t ime of utterance.INTRODUCTIONIt is genera l ly  unders tood  thatthere is no one- to -one cor respondencebetween the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  (realworld) t ime of s i tuat ions  and the gram-mat ica l  express ions  of t ime in sen-tences of natura l  languages.
If thereis no cor respondence  of the extra-l ingu is t ic  s i tuat ion to the l ingu is t icexpress ions,  it is imposs ib le  to simu-late this process  by a computer  model.This  paper  proposes  a model  ofautomat ic  process ing  of t ime- re la tedexpress ions  by int roduc ing the not ionof focus in the cogni t ion level betweenthe ext ra - l ingu is t i c  t ime of s i tuat ionsand the l ingu is t ic  express ions  of time.As  well, it points  the way toward thecomputer - rea l i za t ion  of the model.
Thecomputer  programming language used forthis model  is SNOBOL.Fa i lu re  of cor respondence  betweenan ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion and l in-gu ist ic  express ions  of the t ime conceptcan eas i ly  be demonst ra ted  in most  lan-guages, if not all.
For  example, sup-pose the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion isthe speaker 's  wr i t ing  dur ing a cer ta inper iod in the past  (say, between twoand three o 'c lock  yesterday) .
In re-ference to it, we can use any of thefo l lowing sentences.
(i) I wrote  a letter.
(2) I was wr i t ing  a letter.
(3) I have wr i t ten  a letter.
(4) I had wr i t ten  a letter  (whenJohn  came).The d i f ferences  among sentences (i)through (4) are at t r ibuted to thespeaker 's  d i f ferent  point  of view.Comr i@ ment ions  that 'aspects are dif-ferent  ways Qf v iewing the internaltemporal  const i tuenc\[  ~ of s ituations.
'The speaker 's  way of viewing, however,af fects  not on ly  his choice of aspectsbut also his choice of tenses.
Notethe fo l lowing examples from Japanese.
(5) ah sokoni aru.
'There it isI'(6) ah sokoni atta.
'There it was (all the time)!
'There is no d i f ference in the denota-t ive meaning of sentences (5) and (6).Both  sentences can be used when someonehas found something he has been lookingfor.
Whether  the speaker uses sentence(5) or sentence (6) depends, again, onhis v iew point.FOCUSThe d i f ference in the speaker 'sv iew-point ,  or that of cognit ion,  can-not be ignored, as seen in the aboveexamples, when we cons ider  the t ime-re lated express ions  of natural  lan-guage.
Phys ica l  events in the extra-l ingu is t ic  wor ld  present themselves  assense data, and are perce ived not pass-ively, but act ive ly  by an intervent ionof mind, and are subsequent ly  stored inthe momory  as exper iences.
The exper i -ences represent  the mater ia l  that canbe formulated and ar t icu lated as thel inguis t ic  forms.We be l ieve  that unless  we incor-porate cogni t ion into the process  ofgenerat ing  l inguis t ic  express ions  wecannot exp la in  the re lat ionsh ip  betweenthe ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ions and thel inguis t ic  express ions.
And we con-s ider the not ion of focus the most  im-portant  cogni t ive  e lement in connect ionwi th  t ime-related express ions.
'Focus'is def ined as the per iod along theext ra - l ingu is t i c  t ime l ine upon whichthe speaker  d i rects  his attent ion.MODELBy incorporat ing the speaker 'sfocus into a model  we can generate  thet ime-re lated express ions  rather-101  - -automatically, that is, by one-to-onecorrespondence, and therefore it ispossible to implement this model as acomputer model to generate l inguisticexpressions.For the model we consider threelevels; that is,i.
the extra- l inguist ic (real world)level,2.
the cognit ion level, and3.
the l inguistic level.Information on extra- l inguist ic situ-ations observed by the speaker isstored in the extra- l inguist ic level inthe form of the situation and its ex-isting period of time.
The speaker'sfocus in the cognition level is matchedagainst the situation(s) in the extra-l inguistic level and the way theymatch or do not match determines theselection of l inguistic items such asverbs, adjectives, negation, aspect andtense.The l inguistic level forms thesentences by syntactic, morphologicaland phonological rules.EXTRA-LINGUISTIC LEVELThe computer model under consider-ation simulates this process by ourcreating three levels here also.
Theextra- l inguist ic level stores infor-mation on situations in the followingform (Nos.
2-9 of the appended program).SITUATION START-DS END-DS END-SSSPEAK(I) 10030930 10031000READ(I,A-BOOK)10021400 10021630COME(JOHN,HERE)I0021130 10021200 10021400GO-ON(A-LIGHT)10021900 10021900 10022359CALM(IT,HERE)10012000 10012000 10030500The information includes situation inthe form of verbal expressions andtheir arguments, the starting time ofdynamic situations, the ending time ofdynamic situations, and the ending timeof static situations.
In the numberfor the time, the first two digitsstand for the month, the next two forthe day, the next two for the hour, andthe last two for the minute.
Thisnumber system may be expanded to in-clude the year, the second, etc.Extra- l inguist ic  situations aredivided into two categories; dynamic andstatic.
Fox the distinction, let usquote LyonsJ(p. 483) .A static situation (or state-of-affairs, or state) is one that isconceived of as existing, rather thanhappening, and as being homogeneous,continuous and unchanging throughoutits duration.
A dynamic situation,on the other hand, is something thathappens (or occurs, or takes place):it may be momentary or enduring; itis not necessari ly either homogeneousor continuous, but may have any ofseveral temporal contours;...Dynamic situations are in turndivided into two types.
Those such as'reading' are situations occurring fora certain period of time.
Thereforesituations of this type have a startingtime and an ending time.
The secondtype of dynamic situation, like '(alight) going on', is momentary, andtherefore it is understood that thestarting time and the ending time areidentical.Static situations, on the otherhand, continue for a certain period oftime.
But they may be results of dy-namic situations and they may alsochange into other situations again bydynamic situations.
The starting timeof a static situation is usual ly theending time of a dynamic situation andits ending time, if any, is the startingtime of another dynamic situation.It is worth mentioning here thatwhat are stored in this level are notl inguistic expressions but situations.Therefore, the time period of an ex-isting situation is not influenced bythe type of part icular l inguistic ex-pressions of a part icular natural lan-guage.
Taking an Engl ish expressionfor example, '(a light) goes on' isconsidered to be momentary event.Therefore, we cannot say '~a light isgoing on.'
However, 'lights are goingon' is possible, in which case we canidentify a different starting time andending time.
Further, if we could ob-serve the period of duration of alight going on by a high-speed film forinstance, the different starting andending times could be recorded in thedata by expanding time digits to secondor mill isecond.However, there are some phenomenapeculiar to individual languages.
Forinstance, the situation of 'coming' is--102--cons idered to have a t ime durat ion  inEngl ish.
Therefore,  ' John is coming'is a paraphrase  of ' John is on the way.
'But in Japanese it is cons idered to bemomentary,  that is, 'coming' is a sortof swi tch from 'is not here' to 'ishere'.
There fore  there is not Japaneseexpress ion  equ iva lent  to Eng l i sh  ' Johnis coming.'
Theoret ica l ly ,  this k indof d i f ference among indiv idual  lan-guages should be taken care of by elab-orat ing the structure of s i tuat ions  inthe data of this level, but in the cur-rent model  it is taken care of by thel inguis t ic  level.COGNIT ION LEVELNow in the cogni t ion  level, thefocused s i tuat ion and the per iod offocus as wel l  as the t ime of u t teranceare inserted into the program (ProgramNos.
10-27).
The focused s i tuat ion  isin the form of verbal  express ion  andits arguments.
The per iod  of focus isin the form of e i ther  a t ime adverbia lsuch as 'now', 'this morning, ,  'yes-terday' and ' last month',  or numbersfor chrono log ica l  t ime points  s imi larto those of ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat iontime.
When the input is a t ime adverb-ial, the program ca lcu lates  it againstthe t ime of ut terance and t rans latesit into chronolog ica l  numbers  (ProgramNos.
28-40).So far, data stored in the pro-gram are:i. Ex t ra - l ingu is t i c  s ituat ions,  eachcomprising:a. the start ing t ime-po int  of adynamic s i tuat ion(A),b. the ending t ime-po int  of adynamic s i tuat ion(B),c. the ending t ime-po int  of astat ic  s i tuat ion(C);2.
T ime of utterance(O):3.
Focused situat ion, compris ing:a. the start ing t ime-po int  offocus(S),  andb.
the ending t ime-po int  offocus(E).Here it is checked whether  a par-t icu lar  ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion ex-ists w i th in  the focused per iod or mo-ment  and, if so, how it is focused.On the bas is  of the re lat ionsh ip  amongthe three k inds of t ime-po ints  of anext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion (A,B and C),and the two k inds of focus t ime-po intsof the same focused s i tuat ion (S andE), the cagegor ies  of aspects are de-termined (Program Nos.
41-62).The categor ies  of aspects are de-termined in the fo l lowing way:I .i.a.b.2.a.b.If the focus is on the Stat icS i tuat ion(SS)~and if the focus is on thepoint,and if the focus is complete lyinside the SS, then: STATIVE,otherwise,  the Dynamic  Si tu-ation(DS) is checked.If it is otherwise,and if the SS over laps  thefocus completely,  then:STATIVE,otherwise,  the DS is checked.II.
If the focus is complete ly  out-side the DS, then: NEGATIVE.III.1.If the focus is on a point,and if the DS is on a point,then: PERFECTIVE.2.
If it is otherwise,  anda.
if the focus is on the begin-ning of the DS, then: PER-FECTIVE ( INGRESSIVE),b. if the focus is on the endingof the DS, then: PERFECTIVE(COMPLETED),c. if ne i ther  of the above, then:IMPERFECTIVE.IV.i.2.a?b.i.ii.iii.If the focus is on a period,and if the DS is on a point,then: PERFECTIVE.If it is otherwise,  andthe DS over laps  the focus com-pletely, then: IMPERFECTIVE,if the DS over laps  the focuspart ia l ly,  andthe beg inn ing  of the DS ison or before  the ending ofthe focus, then: PERFECTIVE( INGRESSIVE),the ending of the DS is on orbefore the ending of thefocus, then: PERFECTIVE(COMPLETED),it is ne i ther  of the above,then: PERFECTIVE.Th is  aspect ass ignment  is i l lust ratedin the d iagrams in the Append ix  I.The categor ies  of tenses are inturn determined on the bas is  of there la t ionsh ip  between the focused timeand the t ime of u t terance  (ProgramNos.
63-69).
If the focus is on thet ime of utterance,  the PRESENT is as-signed.
If the focus is before  thet ime of utterance,  the PAST is as-signed~ if the reverse, the FUTURE.Japanese and Russian,  for example,work  in this way.
In Eng l i sh  one more--103--category of tense is needed.
That is,if the focus is on a period and the endof the focus coincides with the time ofutterance, the PAST-PRESENT is assigned.This category will later cover ex-pressions like 'I have been studyinglinguistics.
'FINAL REMARKSIn the l inguistic level time-related morphemes are assigned on thebasis of the categories of t ime-relatedexpressions sent from the cognit ionlevel.
Here the pecul iarit ies of indi-vidual natural languages are involved.Therefore a unique program is requiredfor each natural language.
After  themorpheme assignments, syntactic andmorphological rules together withphonological rules determine the formsin the sentences.We shall omit detailed discussionon this level, since this process in-volving word categories closely re-lated to the dist inction between dy-namic and static situations is compli-cated.
For simplicaity of explanation,we have omitted the discussion and theprogramming of expressions of habit,experience and atemporal expressions.We have also omitted the discussion ofrelative tenses.In summary, we have discussed anautomatic process of t ime-expressiongeneration in natural language.
Webelieve that this is only possible bythe introduction of the speaker's timefocus and an examination of the rela-t ionship between the extra- l inguist icsituational time and focused time.
Byfurther examining the manner of mor-pheme assignments in as many naturallanguages as possible, we believe, wecan expand the number of universalrules common to all languages andminimize the number of rules peculiarto individual languages.
