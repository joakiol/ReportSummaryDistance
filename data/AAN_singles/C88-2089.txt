Vallvidriera, 25.27CORNELLA, 08940-BARCELONA 08017-BARCELONASpainAbstractOne of the ways to achieve a good translation ofverbal forms is the morphosp~tactic approach, which consistsin a function pairing the different morphological tensesthat occur in a given language with the tenses of the otherlanguage.
Complicated rules must be established to calculatethe right pair for an expression, because of the amount ofdiscrepancies that differmnt languages show with respect toeach other.The way we have chosen to deal with this problem is,conversely, the projection of the different values comingfrom verbs (type, processivity, morftense, morfaspect,moodrequire~nent), from adverbs, prepositional phrases andtemporal N~S (deixis, espect, iteration), and fromsubordinate conjunctions (aspect, moodrequirement).All this information permits to obtain a final valuefor aspect .~nd tense for the whole sentence, which later oni8 percolated, not only to the verb node, but also to thethe rest of elements conveying information.Our proposal relies on the fact that tense/aspectcalculation is relevant not only for a good translation ofverbs, but also for a good translation of adverbs, PPs,temporal I~.~ and conjunctions, as we have intended todemonstrat~ ~n this paper.L Introduction'1~li~ article deals with a methodology to achieve theright t~s~lsiation of temporal expressions by giving accountof the temporal reference and temporal relations in/ betweensentences.
The task to accomplish is to translatesy,%tactic marks into semantic values that decide/ reflectthe aspectnal value of the sentences.Fo3:' o6r treatment of time and aspect we draw on thework of Eamp \[1979\] and Partee \[1984\] who have argued fortaking statos and events as primitives and relations ofprecedanco ~md overlapping between them.
The orderingrelation ~t~n events is crucial for deciding about theaspect of the sentences involved.~hn presemt proposal presumes an analysis end ageme~ation t!omponent that deliver a set of S-trees whoseleaves cor~:espond to words.
The pre-terminals havemorpbosynta?
:tic and ~elational information.
As usual,features ar~J percolated and nodes get features assigned.~he time/ aspectual problem is dealt with under theperspect?~* of MT with the aim of sketching a system thatcan be i~lemented independently of the particularformalisms of different MT-systems.To outline a general model for the time/aspectcalculation in MT we subsume a system with PSG rules thatobtain some sentence structure with no regard to a specificgrammar type; it could be an augmented PSG, as in METAL, orsome kind of deep syntactic structure, as it is the case inEurotra.The problem is the well known fact that translationsof temporal expressions in NL does not involve a simplemapping of tenses and adverbials.
We could just compareSpanish, rich ill aspect and tenses vs. German or English.That is, a MT dealing with Germanic and Romance languages isconcerned with different parameters for each language; thewhole practice in MT systems is to translate morphologicaltenses, and syntactical values into reference times thatinclude events or stutes \[Partee 1984\].Once the set of factors and values relevant for thespecification oi!
time, aspect, and mood has been defined, acalculation or unification in the form of rules fixes thevalues that must be generated in the target language.
Such asystem must "preserve" the same "semantic interpretation"for different language realisations, in order to be able togenerate the right morphological tenses and periphrasis fromlanguage to language.2.
AktionsartVendler's definition of Aktionsart \[1967\] relies ona classification of verbs into sentences.
However, we startfrom verb primitives that are categorized (Verb Type) into:- stative : to be in love, stand, know..- dynamic : w~ite, arrive, love,..and we take an additional feature "Processive" to mark thedifferences between activities vs. accomplishment,ach?evement or quality/state vs. stance (R. Quirk 1985).The inherent type o f  these verb primitives isoverridden during, the analysis by the morphological tenseand by the syntactic functions, so that we finally obtain a437value for the Aktionsart of the whole phrase.- write (ancribir): VT = activity, Proc --yes(a durative verb)- send (enviar) : ~ : activity, Proc --no(a punctual verb)The original aktionsart of the verb, durativeactivit,y becomes an accomplishment in the sentence "I wrotea letter", In Spanish this information must be marked inorder to choose the right past form.l \[escribio \[una caxta\]\] --> VT=activity & proc--no~-> tense=Indefinite Past\[escrib~a\] --> AKT=activity~-> tense=Imperfect3.
DeixisThe calculation of the time value, which is alwaysexpressed as a deictic value relating the speech time to thereference time, is obtained out of the deictic values of themorphological tenses together with the adverbials present inthe sentence.
For instance, the Spanish present tense hasthe value \[simultaneous and posterior\].
If it al~earswith a posterior adverbial, the final value is posterior.The deixis assigment in Spanish is reflected in table i. Theleft side is the assigmant in contexts with no temporaltransposition; the right side shows the assigmant for tensetransposition.
The context for tense transposition is givenfor knowledge and diction verbs.Table 1 : Deictic assigmcnt to the tenses in SpanishNo Tense Transposition I Tense T~ansposition..................................
I ........................Tense Deixis i Deixia..................................
I .......................Present simul, post ~ simul, postPast1 ( Inde finido) ant I antPast2 (leper fento) ant I simulFuture post l postConditional ~ post ............................................................Temporal modifiers can belong to different classes:1 - Adverbs: in this case the deictic value comesfrom the dictionary2 - PP: the deictic value comes f r~ thePreposition3 - l~: The deictin value is the result of twofactors:a\] the demostrativas endb) the temporal type of the singular noun~'s  when temporal desiguatora have theDeixia \[ant,post\].
When they appea~ witha plural definite a~ticle, this is anoperator that overrides the originaldeixi8 values end yields the iterativaaspect.438i.e.
: "el lunes "\[past, ante\] (="onmonday"\]ve.
"los lunes" liter| (on mondays)The delxis feature is the dianri~Linatlng factorto get the right transfer for "lunes".4 - Subordinate clauses : the deictic value of thisadverbials is a calculus of the deictic valueof the conjunction (if present), and that ofthe tense and of the mood, if present.There are two possible cases depending on thesource language ( Germanic or Romance).
For thefirst case, the axpectual value of theconjunction end the temporal value of the mainclause select the mood of the subordinateclause.
The deini8 value of the main clause i8copied onto the subordinate conjunction; thisvalue decides about the 8ubjuntive ~squir~entof the conjunction.
Let's take the conjunction" t i l l "  (Eng.
), "his" (Ge~.
), "bests que" (Spa,.
)that has no deictic value.
I f  the main clauseis in future, "till" gets the deixis "post", ifit iS past than it' gets accordingly the deixis"ante".The interesting fact is that, according to theobtained deictic value the conjunctim~, selectsthe subjunctive requirement.
When theconduction has assigned in the lexicon thecom~itunt of subjunctive requirement, thisvalue is the most relevant.
For example:,~ I will\[pc}t\], work, t~ll\[post\]" you come"Traba\]ar~\[post\], hastaque\[deixis--~ost\] vengas"==> \ [aubre~es \ ]"Er arbeitete\[ante\] hls\[ante\] mr kam""Trabaj6 \[ante\] hasta que\[de~xis=ante\]lleg6\[ante\]"Taerefo~e the following general rule can befomulated:Source Conjunction \[poSt\] =>Tenge~Con~nct ion \ [ subr~ \]Again the deLv/s value also selects the righttransfer of the conjunction.

\]The relevance of the presence/absence of theprogresaivity can be shown when we translate into Greek.
Inth i s  language the same aspect value generates di f ferenttenses according to presence or absence of progressivity.For instance, i f  aspect i8 retrospective and there i sprogressivity then the corresponding tense i s  Imperfect, hutif there is no presence of progressivity the correspondingtense for this aspect is Present perfect.The morphological tenses also imply monolingnalaspectual assignments.
Here we will follow the proposal ofF.
van E~de.
According to it, each language has a differentdistribution of aspectual features in tenses.
However, hereagain we prefer to split up the mo~hological valuesaccording to two attributes : form end pro~fesivilyform.4.2 Aspeetual  value of adverbia lsAdverbs as well as prepositions and conjunot?ons havein the lexicon an aspectual value assig~ent.
Temporal NP'sas adverbials get the aspectual assigment from theirdete~inents or quantifiers.
Bare plurals or distributivequantifiera assign the value \[ iterativity\], whileAll-cuantifier8 furnish the NP with durativity, expressed insome languages as progressivity.
"EE a~beitet den ganzen Tag ..... Esta trabajando todo el dlaFor instance, iterativity must be delivered from thesource language in order to generate the right tense even forpunctual verbs, e.g.
:"un d~a I envio flores a Carmen" ="he once sent flowers to Carmen" vs."envlaba cede d~a flore8 a Carmen"="he sent to Carmen flowers every day"Deterniners/quentifiers have aspentual values as:un \[parr\]; cede \[ iter\]; todaa \[iter); todo/a \[dur\]So the transfer of "d~a" is "once" if we areconcerned with a perfeative HP-adverbial.
However thetransfer of "d/a" e8 'day' when the aspeetual calculus hasfurnished the NP with the feature \[dnr\] or liter\].In PP'a the final aspectual value is the result ofthe calculus of the aspect value of the preposition togetherwith the daixis of the adverbial.
For instance, the |~undarypreposition "deeds" {since} with anterior adverbials yields afinal terminative aspect, but with a posterior adverbial, oreven with a anterior adverbial but together with anotherboundary expression (the final Point of the temporal} ?tyields a perfective aspect.
Examples:"dasda e.yer\[ente.\] t rabaja aq.~ .
.
.
.
.
> teminati~"dearie a~ora traDajard en EUROTRA" .... > perfective439"trabajo agu\[ desde el lunes hasta el jueves .... >perfective\[perf\]  \[limitl--term\] \[limit 2--perf\]The resulting aspect value of this calculus must heattached to the preposition or adverb (overriding) the oldvalues in order to get the right transfer.. .

.en \[perf.\] --> infor\[perf.\] --> enfor \[dur.
\] --> duranteIn subordinate clauses the process is the same.
As wehave seen above the deixis of the calculus of the main clausemust be attached to the conjunction.
Thus, the calculus ofthe aspect of the main clause must be furnished to theconjunction in order to be able to get the right transfer ofthe conjunction and also for generating the right tense inthe subordinate clause.Another important factor in the calculus of the aspect isthe syntactic type of the constituents in the sentences.These determine the aspectual properties (Dowry).
Toillustrate it we take the examples of Dowry(1986)"John walked" -- Juan paseaba\[activity\]"John walked to the station" -- rue ?
la esteciotn\[achievment\]"John walked a mile" -- anduvo una mille\[accomplishment\]As we can appreciate, the Spanish sentences have adifferent lexical verb form for each of these aspectualdifferences.
Up to now METAL have different transfersaccording to the different verb frames.
Eurotra-Germanyproposes to disambiguate in the Interface Structure by meansof semantic feature bundles.
Besides the constituencyfactors of the syntax, another important fact is thepresence/absence of bare plurals for the objects:"lleva escribiando novelas tres a~os" --"she has bean writing novels for 3 Years""sie schreibt Romane seit 3 Jahren" vs."He wrote a novel" -- "escribi~ una novela"\[Past~ per feotive\]"He wrote novels" --- "escribla novelas"\[Past, durative\]That means that the original verb value forprooessivity is cverriden according to the NP's that go withthe verb.
NP's with quantifiers assign the aspantual valuesso that punctual verbs express processes, or viceversa.5.
P rocess  fo r  the  ca lcu lusThe ca lcu lus  of  t ime and aspect  can be implemented e i ther  as:- a unification of features together with filters thatcatch or kill complex cases.

progressivityThe calculation process delivers a final value as aresult which must be percolated to the S node.
This processhas the characteristic of a functional composition, providedthat the different values can be considered as operatorsapplied in a hierarchical order.
The dominant value is theadverbial.\[Adv.
(post) \[V (simul,post) \] \] ---> S (post)\[Adv.
(term) \[V (perf, dur) \] \] ---> S (term)The calculus provides a value for S, andS-subclauses, but also for all the temporals implied so thatthey can be properly translated into morphological values, orinto lexicalized forms.7.
SummaryIn NL processing the calculus of Time and Aspect is acomplex thing where almost all elements of the sentence areconcerned.
The dynamics of the aspect and deixis in NaturalLanguage can be captured in the framework of a calculus ofthese.
Same tables in this article give acquitance of thisprocess.
The originality of our proposal relies on thefollowing aspects:- Unicity of criteria (the same features for alltemporal categories)- Uminity of adverbial types (the same treatment forsubordinated temporal clauses, for adverbs and PP's.- A strong interrelation of the aspectual modal anddeictic values in the constituents of the sentence.440~ ~stach~t o~ the verb pzivacy for aspect in favorof ~ bi-di~ectloaal intez~elstion.
