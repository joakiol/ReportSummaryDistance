Machine Translation Using IsomorphicUCGsJohn L. BEAVEN*Pete WHITELOCKDepar tment  of Artificial Intell igenceUniversity of Ed inburgh80 South BridgeEd inburgh EH1 1HNScotlandAbst rac tThis paper discusses the application of Unification CategorialGrammar (UCG) to the framework of Isomorphic Grammars forMachine Translation pioneered by Landsbergen.
The IsomorphicGrammars approach to MT involves developing the grammars ofthe Source and Target languages in parallel, in order to ensurethat SL and TL expressions which stand in the translation rela-tion have isomorphic derivations.
The principle advantage of thisapproach is that knowledge concerning translation equivalence ofexpressions may be directly exploited, obviating the need for an-swers to semantic questions that we do not yet have.
Semantic andother information may still be incorporated, but as constraints onthe translation relation, not as levels of textual representation.After introducing this approach to MT system design, andthe basics of monolingual UCG, we will show how the two canbe integrated, and present an example from an implemented bi-directional Engllsh-Spanish fragment.
Finally we will present someoutstanding problems with the approach.1 Background and IntroductionThe aim of this paper is to explore how the linguistic theory knownas Unification Categorial Grammar can be adapted to the generalmethodology ofMachine Translation using Isomorphic Grammars,as pioneered by Landsbergen and others in the ROSETTA team\[Landsbergen 87a, b\].UCG is one of several recent grammar formalisms \[Calder et al86, Karttunen 86, Pollard 85\] which are highly lexicalist, i.e.
rulesof syntactic ombination are not a language-specific component ofthe grammar, but are very general in character, and combinatoryinformation is primarily associated with lexical items.Lexical items are represented by sets of feature-value pairs(where the values may be themselves sets of such pairs}, and arecombined by unification into objects of the same type.
The lan-guage defined is thus the closure of the lexicon under the combi-natory rules.Landsbergen's work on Isomorphic Grammars follows Monta-gue's approach of having a one-to-one correspondence b tweensyntactic and semantic rules.
A syntactic rule Rs/, in the SourceLanguage corresponds to a syntactic rule RTL in the Target Lan-guage if and only if they are both associated with the same seman-tic operation Rsem.
The translation relation is then defined in aprecise manner and it can be guaranteed that well-formed expres-sions in the Source Language are translatable, as there will be anexpression i  the Target Language that is derived in a correspond-ing way, and can therefore be considered as a possible translationof it.
*Supported by a studentship from the Science and Engineering ResearchCouncil.According to Landsbergen, writing isomorphic grammars i  away of being explicit about the "tuning" of SL and TL grarmnarsthat is essential for reliable MT.
The present paper is an attemptto adapt this approach to a type-driven mapping between syntaxand semantics.2 I somorph ic  GrammarsWe can recognise two basic relations of relevance in translation.namely, "possible translation" (which is symmetric}, and "besttranslation" given the current context and much extra-linguisticknowledge (which is not symmetric}.
We take the task of the lin.~guistic component of an MT system to be a correct and completecharacterisation f the former, and will have nothing further tosay about the latter.An important problem that arises in an interlingual translationsystem is what Landsbergen \[Landsbergen 87b\] calls the "subsetproblem".
If the analysis component generates a set L of interlin?gum expressions, and the generation component accepts a set L Iof them, the only sentences that can be translated are those thatcorrespond to expressions in the intersection L N L ~.
If the gram-.mars of the source and target languages are written independently,there is no way of guaranteeing that they map the languages intothe same subset.The problem arises because a sufficiently powerful system of"interlingual representation will contain an infinite number of log-ically equivalent expressions that represent a meaning of a givenSource Language expression.
Of course, the Source Languagegrammar will only associate a single one of these with a givenSL expression.
However, in the absence of specific tuning, thisis not guaranteed to be the same one that the Target Languagegrammar associates with any of the translation equivalents.Therefore, SL and TL grammars must be tuned to each other.This is not a problem specific to interlingual translation: in thetransfer approach to MT system design, this tuning is effected byan explicit transfer module.
The use of Isomorphic Grammarsis another way of being explicit about this, tuning the grammarsthemselves rather than their inputs/outputs, which offers a greaterpossibility of bi-directionality than the transfer approach.Landsbergen assumes the existence of compositional grammarsfor two languages, that is, grammars in which i) basic expres-sions correspond to semantic primitives and ii) each syntactic rulethat builds up a complex linguistic expreaqion from simpler ones ispaired with a semantic rule that builds the meaning of the complexexpression from the meanings of the simpler ones.The tuning of grammars consists in ensuring that there it~ abasic expression in one grammar corresponding to each basic ex-~pression in the other, and that for each semantic rule there is acorresponding syntactic rule in each grammar.
Two expressionsare then considered possible translations of each other if they canbe derived from corresponding basic expressions by applying cor~responding syntactic rules.
In other words, they are possible transolations of each other if they are built from expressions having thesame rneaning, by using syntactic rules that perform the same se-mantic oper,tions.
Note the lack of directional specificity in thisdefinition of the "possible translation" relation./ v 8 The ~monohngual) UCG formalis~nMany recent grarmnar formalisms \[Shieber 86\] represent linguisticobjects as t~ts of attribute-.value pairs.
Values taken by theseattributes may be atomic, variables, or they may thenmelves besets of attribate-value pairs, so these objects *nay be thought of asDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), in which directed arcs representfeature% and the nodes at the end of these represent values.
Suchformalisms t~pically support re-entrancy, that is, they provide amechanism 5)r specifying that object~s at the end of different pathsare the same object.Unification Gategorinl Grarimaar is such a formalism, whichcombines a categorial treatment of syntax with semantics similarto Kamp's :Vliscourse Representation \[Kamp 81\].
Each linguisticexpression licensed by the grammar corresponds to what is calleda sign.
A sigt~ consists of four main entries or features, which areexplained below:1. phono logy  (orthography in the present cruse)2. synta) :3. semant ics4.
The o :der  in which the terms combine.Typical signs for the lexical entries Mary and sings *nay thenlook something like the following:phon: "Mary"synt: npA nmn:  s inggen: fernSe~l :  maryord: Orderandphon: singsphon: Pho isynt: sentA\[ tense: flu \]/ sFnt: npAsexfl: SeE~oral: postsere."
\[\]q\[siugs(E,Sem)\]ord.
~ O*derpets:snlgThese are briefly explained below.
Note that in the above ex-ample, as ehewhere, the Prolog-like convention is adopted thatconstants tart with lower-case or are within quotes, and vari-ables start with upper-case.
Also, for the sake of simplicity inan introductory example, the first example above differs from thestandard UCG practice of typeoraising noun phrases, which followsMontague arm others.3.\].
SyntaxThere are 4 basic categories: nouns (noun), sentences ( eat), nounphrases (np) and prepositional phrases (pp).
These may be furtherspecified by features (such as nun iher ,  gender,  etc.).
Featuresare indicated by the operator A.A category is either a basic category, or of the form A/B,where A is ~ category and B is a sign.
Combination of signsis determined by the rule of function application, which allows afunctor sign with syntax A/B to combine with an argument signB t, to give a sign like the funetor sign but with syntax A. Thecombination is licensed if B and B' unify, and if the functor andargument signs appear in the order specified by the value of theorder  feature in B (if the order  feature of an argument is pre itsfunctor must precede it, and if it is poet the functor follows it).The unification may further instantiate variables in the functorsign (in particular, the semantics).
Although Function Applica-tion is the main combination rule, there are a few important unaryrules, such as Gap Deletion, pp-insertion, and others.
Unlike manyother extended Categorial Grammars, UCG does not have Func~tional Composition, as a similar effect is achieved by the techniqueof Gap Threading, based on work by Johnson and Klein \]Johnsonand Klein 86\].
However it is envisaged that a richer set of binaryrules, and a reduction or elimination of unary rules, will be nec-essary if the Isomorphic Grammars approach is to be extended totypologically diverse languages.3.2 Semant icsThe semantic formalism used in UCG is similar to Kamp's DRT,but with a Davidsonlan treatment of predicates.
It is called InL(Indexed Language) and is described in \[Zeevat 86\].
A sentencelike:If a linguist owns a donkey, she writes about itis represented in InL by:\[S1\]\[\[S2\]\[\[X\]linguist(X), \[Y\]donkey(Y), \[S2\]own(S2,Z,Y)\]==~ \[E\]write_about( E,X,Y)\]\]There is an important difference between InL and DRT: eachformula introduces a discourse referent, or index ($1 and $2 above)which corresponds to the semantic object introduced by the for-mula.
Since events, states etc.
are primitive semantic objects, InLpermits a first order treatment of modifiers.Indices contain information about the sortal nature of the dis-course referent in question.
The sorts are coded into a subsump-tion lattice, and consist of bundles of features which may be uni~fled.
Unification ensures for instance that predicates have argu.-ments of the right sort.4 UCG and I somorph ic  GrammarsThe principle of Isomorphic Grammars is realised in UCG bymeans of bilingual signs.
Bilingual rules, which combine bilingualsigns, may be defined in terms of how monolingual rules combinethe monolinguM parts of the sign.As was mentioned, monolinguM UCG signs consist of four fea-tures: Phonology, Syntax, Semantics, and Order.
A bilingual signis merely a sign with top-level attributes ource and target  hav-ing monolingual signs as their values, and in which source se~mant ics  and target  semant ics  hare their value.
Since transla~ties must preserve semantics, this sharing of values is a necessarycondition.
In the general case, however, it is not sufficient (sevsection 5).The Bilingual sign can easily be decomposed into, or built upfrom, a Source sign and a Target sign (having a common Seman-tics), by a Prolog predicatedecompose(Bllingual_Si~t, Source_Sign, Target_Sign).Combination of two monolingual signs is defined by two pred-icates:33source_combine(S1, S2.
S).target_combine(Tl, T2, T).which combine their first two arguments o give the third.The crucial difference between these two predicates i  as fol-lows: source_combine r quires that the order  feature of S1 and$2 is consistent with the phonology of S, while target_combineensures that the phonology of T is consistent with the order  ofT1 and T2.
This enables differences in word order in the Sourceand Target Languages to be accounted for, as shown below.The two monolingual modes of combination above are used todefine bilingual combination through a predicate:b i l ingual_combine(B1,  B2, B):-decompose(B1, S1, T1),decompose(B2, S2, T2),source_combine(S1, $2, S).target_combine(Tl, T2, T),decompose(B, S, T).The way in which differences in word order are dealt with maybe illustrated by the translatioin equivalence between an adjective-noun combination i English and a noun-adjective combination iSpanish.
For the sake of simplicity, only the features for phonol -ogy, syntax  and order  are included.The predicate source_comblne allows two combinations:(I) gz A/B s: C ----* ptm AWl W2o: pro(2) s: C p: W2 p~ WI W2o: post  s: A/B ~ m A(where the active part of the functor sign unifies with the argu-ment sign)The predicate target_combine, on the other hand, allows theabove two combinations, and in addition the two order-reversingones:s: A /B  m C ~ p: W2 Wlo: post s: A(4) e: C p:  W2 p:  W2 Wls: A/B --4 .
: Ao: preLet us then examine how the English expression red book getstranslated into the Spanish llbro rojo, in which the order of theadjective and noun are reversed.The bilingual signs are:\[ sre:p:  redtgtsp~tgtzs: noun/ s:z postand\[ src:p: book 1 tgt:p: nbrogrc:9~ nountgt:s: nounThese will get decomposed into their source and target con-stituents, which may only be combined using (1) and (3) above,respectively:34st noun p: book (1} p: red bookm noun m noun a~ nouno:  p reCurrently, we assume the existence of four bilingual signs coreresponding to the English word red, since the Spanish adjectivehas four combinations of gender and number.
Only that sign re~.resenting the contextually correct translation equivalence will beincorporated in the derivation.
In a practical system, there wouldbe a single bilingual sign whose Spanish component has disjunctive(or unspecified) values for gender and number, and the incorpora-tion of this sign into the derivation will eliminate the disjunction(or bind the variables).Unlike Landsbergen's approach, it is not necessary to specit~ythat the rules which combine the SL and TL expressions must bethe same.
Because of the type-driven mapping between syntax andsemantics, if two pairs of signs stand in the translation relation,then so will the pair of signs resulting from their combination,regardless of the rule used.5 Cur rent  Di f f icult iesThere are several important difficulties that remain unsolved.
Thefirst one is how to handle the differences in the freedom of wordorder in two languages.
For instance, Spanish word order is rel-atively free compared to English.
It conveys important stylisticinformation that should be capturdd in the translation, but whichat present gets lost.
Another aspect of the same problem is thatwe would like to be able to recognise all possible word orders inSpanish, without generating them all (as some are intelligible but,sound awkward).A possible solution to this could be to include some measureof the degree of "markedness" of a construction i  each language.The translation process would attempt o keep the markedness ofthe two constructions as close as possible to each other.
If thegrammar specifies that Spanish sentences may be more "marked"than the English, the more marked would never be generated,though they could be analysed.Another problem is how the set of basic bilingual signs is tobe characterised.
That the semantics of SL and TL signs unify isa necessary condition for them to stand in the relation of trans-lation equivalence.
It is however insufficient in two ways.
First,it must be the case that there is no more specific sign in eitherlanguage whose semantics unifies with that of the other language,and which is of similar markedness.
Secondly, it must be thecase that the semantics of the two signs will continue to unify re~.gardless of the derivations into which the signs are incorporated.For instance, suppose that the English word leg is associated withthe semantics \[leg~of(X,Y)\], and the Spanish word pieraa with\[leg_of(X,Y),human(Y)\].
Although these semantic values do notcontradict each other, they will if Y becomes bound to a non-human entity.
In this case, the solution is clear ?
a further bilinogual sign must be constructed in which English leg is paired withSpanish pats, having the semantics \[leg_of(X,Y),not(human(Y))\].Then, either the derivation will eliminate one or the other equiva.-lence, or both translations will be produced, which is the desiredresult.It is possible that one monolingual component of a bilinguallexical sign will not be a basic expression i that language.
Instead,it must be explicitly constructed in order to be paired with a basicexpression i  the other language.
The unification-based semanticsgives an indication of when such a sign-construction process musttake place.
The flexible categorial approach to the construction ofconstituents allows the non-standard categories needed to be built.in a sense, ell the hard work of this approach takes place at thispoint.
See \[Whitelock 881 for a discussion of the issues involved.Finally, ghore is a cluster of problems that impinge on thequestion of ,:omputatlonal efficiency.
It seems unavoidable thatcertain bilinl~ual signs will need to incorporate either discontinuousor null constituents, orboth, ti'om one or the other of the languages-conce  ).
'J~led.g Co~tclusionThis paper presents a view of MT that is based on the direct spec-ification of a computable description of a recursive translation re-lation.
We :~mve proposed a system of simultaneous constraintsplaced on ist,morphie derivation trees in SL and TL whose leaves,~re elements of a finite set of bilingual signs and whose internalnodes stand in a type-driven compositional relationship to theirdaughters.
\[~ is the combioation of unification and categorialtechuiquc.,.~ ~hat makes this idea particularly feasible.
The non-st, andard co~,stituents made available in a thll categorial calculusenables iso~lorphic derivation trees to be built; the partiality ofthe signs aml their combination by unification allows the expres-sion of very precise constraints hat both derivations must satisfy.The p,~rtiality of semantic representations is also crucial in deter-mining the set of equivalences - the bilingual exicon - that formthe basis of lhe recursive translation relation.There remain many problems with realising this approach ins.
practical I~ystem.
However, we believe that there are significantadvantages to be gained by a direct statement of the translationrelation between two languages that is at once declarative, com-putable and linguistically well-ibunded.FLeference~\[Calder et al 86\] Calder, J., Moens, M. and Zeevat, H.
