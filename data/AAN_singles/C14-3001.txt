Accordingly, recent years have also seen an increase inthe development of NLP technologies for concept and relation extraction, summarization, and questionanswering on these data.This tutorial will present an overview of the biomedical and clinical NLP data, tools, and methodswith the intent of providing the researchers with a jump-start into these domains.
We will focus on thedemand for NLP in biomedical and clinical domains, the potential for impact, and the required NLPtasks.
We will introduce this information in the following categories:Overview of biomedical/clinical NLPBiomedical narratives are often dense with domain-specific jargon.
Clinical narratives, in addition to be-ing dense with domain-specific jargon, exhibit the complexities of a specialized sub-language.
They arewritten by the domain experts and for the domain experts.
Their primary purpose is to assist in inform-ing future decisions about the care of the patients.
As a result, both biomedical and clinical narrativespresent challenges for existing open-domain NLP technologies and require special considerations fortheir accurate understanding and interpretation.In this section, we will discuss the data sources currently available to researchers, as well as providean overview of the research questions both domains.
On the clinical side, this includes using EHRsfor phenotyping and decision support systems.
The biomedical side uses NLP to explore fields such asliterature-based discovery and literature searches.Current research questions in biomedical and clinical NLPNLP applications are generally built to answer specific questions about data.
In this section, we will pro-vide examples of the types of questions researchers are asking in the clinical and biomedical domains.Additionally, we will discuss how different linguistic aspects of these data are addressed by looking at ex-isting syntactic (part of speech tagging, parsing) and semantic (concept extraction, temporal informationextraction, coreference resolution) systems.Datasets and the annotation processBuilding annotated corpora for any task can be challenging, but the biomedical and clinical domains haveadditional barriers that make creating these corpora difficult.
In this section, we will discuss availableannotated resources in both domains, and discuss challenges in biomedical and clinical corpus building,such as restrictions on data access and the need for domain experts to be part of the annotation process.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Each of these tracksrequired a separate annotation effort, and in this portion of the tutorial we will describe the end-to-endprocess of creating this annotated resource, from data selection to writing the annotation guidelines tocreating the final gold standards.NLP MethodsJust as there are many research questions in the biomedical and clinical domains, there are many existingNLP systems that address these questions.
In this portion of the tutorial, we will describe the three mainapproaches (rule-based, statistical, and hybrid) commonly used to process biomedical and clinical text.Additionally, we will present on-going research projects from our research labs including (1) extractingstructure and semantics from clinical text through section segmentation and assertion analysis and (2)clinical applications such as phenotype modeling and specific examples of information extraction in theradiology domain.Open questions and future directionsResearch in the fields of biomedical and clinical NLP is far from complete; the end of this tutorial willlook at current unsolved problems in these fields, as well as look ahead towards potential future researchquestions.AcknowledgementsThis tutorial was supported in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) awardNo.
