Extraposition via Complex Domain Formation*Andreas  Katho l  and Car l  Po l la rdDept.
of Linguist ics, 1712 Neil Ave.Ohio State Univers i tyColumbus,  OH 43210, USA{kathol, pollard}?ling, ohio-stat e. eduAbst rac tWe propose a novel approach to extraposi-tion in German within an alternative con-ception of syntax in which syntactic struc-ture and linear order are mediated not viaencodings of hierarchical relations but in-stead via order domains.
At the heart ofour proposal is a new kind of domain for-mation which affords analyses of extrapo-sition constructions that are linguisticallymore adequate than those previously sug-gested in the literature.1 L inear i za t ion  w i thout  phrases t ruc tureRecent years have seen proposals for the elimina-tion of the phrase structure component in syntax infavor of levels of representation e compassing possi-bly nonconcatenative modes of serialization (Dowty,In press; Reape, 1993; Reape, 1994; Pollard et al,1993).
Instead of deriving the string representationfrom the yield of the tree encoding the syntacticstructure of that sentence (as, for instance in GPSG,LFG, and--as far as the relationship between S-structure and PF, discounting operations at PF, isconcerned--GB), these proposals uggest derivingthe sentential string via a recursive process that op-erates directly on encodings of the constituent orderof the subconstituents of the sentence.
In Reape'sproposal, which constitutes an extension of HPSG(Pollard and Sag, 1994), this information is con-tained in "(Word) Order Domains".
On the otherhand, the way that the surface representation is puttogether, i.e.
the categories that have contributedto the ultimate string and the grammatical depen-dency relations (head-argument, head-adjunct, etc.
)holding among them, will be called the "composi-tion structure" of that sentence, represented belowby means of unordered trees.
*Thanks to Bob Kasper for helpful discussions andsuggestions.As an example, consider how a German V1 sen-tence, e.g.
a question or conditional c ause, is derivedin such a system.

'The representation in Figure 1 involves a numberof order domains along the head projection of theclause (\[1\]-\[3\]).
Each time two categories are com-bined, a new domain is formed from the domainsof the daughters of that node, given as a list valuefor the feature DOM.
While the nodes in the deriva-tion correspond to signs in the HPSG sort hierarchy(Pollard and Sag, 1994), the elements in the orderdomains, which we will refer to as domain objects,will minimally contain categorial and phonologicalinformation (the latter given in italics within angledbrackets).
The value of the DOM attribute thus con-sists of a list of domain objects.
Ordering is achievedvia linear precedence (LP) statements.In Reape's approach, there are in essence two waysin which a sign's DOM value can be integrated intothat of its mother.
When combining with its ver-bal head, a nominal argument such as das Buch inFigure 1 in general gives rise to a single domain ele-ment, which is "opaque" in the sense that adjacencyrelations holding within it cannot be disturbed bysubsequent intervention ofother domain objects.
Incontrast, some constituents contribute the contentsof their order domains wholesale into the mother'sdomain.
Thus, in Figure 1, both elements of the VP(\[2\]) domain become part of the higher clausal (\[1\])domain.
As a result, order domains allow elementsthat are not sisters in composition structure to belinearly ordered with respect o each other, contrary1In Kathol and Pollard (1995), we argue for dispens-ing with binary-valued features uch as  INV(ERTED) orEXTRA(POSED) in favor of a multi-valued single featureTOPO(LOGY) which imposes apartition on the set of do-main elements of a clause according to membership nTopological Fields (see also Kathol (In progress)).
Sincenothing in the present proposal hinges on this detail, wekeep with the more common binary features.174\[1\] I S -- V\[SUBCAT O\] DOM/ \[ (las) \] (Karl) \ Lv\[+'NV\] \[ \] ' NP\[NOM ' ( das Buch)rNP\[NOM\]\[4\] \[DOM (\[(KarO\])= V\[SUBCAT (NP\[NOM\])\] 1\[2\] /DOM/ \[("as) 1 ru,,., B,.,ch)\] \ /  L \ Lv\[-FINV\]j ' t NP\[ACC\] \] / J,.

As a consequence, any precedence (but not ad-jacency) relations holding of domain elements in onedomain are also required to hold of those elementsin all other order domains that they are membersof, which amounts to a monotonicity constraint onderiving linear order.
Hence, if \[1\] in Figure 1 wereto be expanded in the subsequent derivation intoa larger domain (for instance by the addition of asentential adverb), the relative order of subject andobject in that domain could not be reversed withinthe new domain.The data structure proposed for domains inReape (1993) is that of a list of objects of type sign.However, it has been argued (Pollard et al, 1993)that signs contain more information than is desirablefor elements of a domain.
Thus, a sign encodes itsinternal composition structure via its DAUGHTERSattribute, while its linear composition is available asthe value of DOM.
Yet, there are no known LP con-straints in any language that make reference to thesetypes of information.
We therefore propose an im-poverished ata structure for elements of order do-mains which only consists of categorial and seman-tic information (viz.
the value of SYNSEM (Pollardand Sag, 1994)) and a phonological representation.This means that whenever a constituent is addedtoa domain as a single element, its information con-tent will be condensed to categorial and phonolog-ical information.

We will refer to the relation between a signS and its representation as a single domain objectO as the compaction, given informally in (2): 3(2) compaction(\[i-\],El ) - -rsig.

One ofthe areas in which this approach as found a naturalapplication is extraposition of various kinds of con-stituents.
Reape (1994) proposes the binary-valuedfeature EXTRA to order an extraposed VP last in thedomain of the clause, using the LP statement in (5):(5) \[--EXTRA\] "~ \[+EXTRA\]Similarly, Nerbonne (1994) uses this feature toaccount for instance for extrapositions of relativeclauses from NPs such as (6); the composition struc-ture proposed by Nerbonne for (6)is given in Fig-ure 3.
(6) einen Hund fiittern \[der Hunger hat\]a dog feed that hunger has'feed a dog that is hungry'The structure in Figure 3 also illustrates the fea-ture UNIONED, which Reape and Nerbonne assumeto play a role in domain formation process.
Thus, aconstituent marked \[UNIONED -Jr-\] requires that thecontents of its domain be shuffled into the domainof a higher constituent that it becomes part of (i.e.it is domain-unioned).
For instance, in Figure 3, the\[UNIONED +\] specification on the higher NP occa-sions the VP domain to comprise not only the verb,but also both domain objects of the NP.
Conversely,a \[UNIONED --\] marking in Reape's and Nerbonne'ssystem effects the insertion of a single domain ob-ject, corresponding to the constituent thus specified.Therefore, in Figure 3, the internal structure of therelative clause domain becomes opaque once it be-comes part of the higher NP domain.3 Shor tcomings  o f  Nerbonne 'sana lys i sOne problematic aspect of Nerbonne's proposal con-cerns the fact that on his account, the extraposabil-ity of relative clauses is directly linked to the Head-Adjunct Schema that inter alia licenses the combi-nation of nominals with relative clauses.
However,whether a clause can be extraposed is independentof its adjunct/complement status within the NP.Thus, (7) illdstrates the extraposition of a comple-ment clause (Keller, 1994):(7) Planck hat die Entdeckung emachtPlanck has the discovery made\[dab Licht Teilchennatur hat\].that light particle.nature has'Planck made the discoverythat light has a particle nature.
'The same also holds for other kinds of extraposableconstituents, such as VPs and PPs.
On Nerbonne'sanalysis, the extraposability of complements has tobe encoded separately in the schema that licenseshead-complement structures.
This misses the gen-eralization that extraposability of some element istied directly to the final occurrence within the con-stituent it is dislocated from.
s Therefore, extrapos-ability should be tied to the linear properties of theconstituent in question, not to its grammatical func-tion.A different kind of problem arises in the case of ex-tractions from prepositional phrases, as for instancein (S):(8) an einen Hund denken \[der Hunger hat\]of a dog think that hunger has'think of a dog that is hungry'On the one hand, there has to be a domain object foran einen Hund in the clausal domain because thisSNote that final occurrence is a necessary, butnot sufficient condition.
As is noted for instance inKeller (1994), NP complements (e.g.
postnominal geni-tives) cannot be extraposed out of NPs despite their finaloccurrence.
We attribute this fact to a general constraintagainst extraposed NPs in clauses, except for adverbialaccusative NPs denoting time intervals.176VP oo.

On the other hand, theattachment site of the preposition will have to behigher than the relative clause because clearly, therelative clause modifies the nominal, but not the PP.As a potential solution one may propose to havethe preposition directly be "integrated" (phonologi-cally and in terms of SYNSEM information) into theNP domain object corresponding to einen Hund.However, this would violate an implicit assumptionmade in order domain-based approaches tolineariza-tion to the effect hat domain objects are inalterable.Hence, the only legitimate operations involve addingelements to an order domain or compacting that do-main to form a new domain object, but crucially, op-erations that nonmonotonically change xisting do-main objects within a domain are prohibited.4 Par t ia l  compact ionIn this section, we present an alternative to Ner-bonne's analysis based on an extension of the pos-sibilities for domain formation.
In particular, wepropose that besides total compaction and domainunion, there is a third possibility, which we will callpartial compaction.
In fact, as will become clear be-low, total compaction and partial compatcion arenot distinct possibilities; rather, the former is a sub-case of the latter.Intuitively, partial compaction allows designateddomain objects to be "liberated" into a higher do-main, while the remaining elements of the sourcedomain are compacted into a single domain object.To see how this improves the analysis of extraposi-tion, consider the alternative analysis for the exam-ple in (6), given in Figure 4.As shown in Figure 4, we assume that the or-der domain within NPs (or PPs) is essentially flat,and moreover, that domain objects for NP-internalprenominal constituents are prepended to the do-main of the nominal projection so that the linearstring is isomorphic to the yield of the usual right-branching analysis trees for NPs.
Adjuncts andcomplements, on the other hand, follow the nomi-nal head by virtue of their \["t-EXTRA\] specification,which also renders them extraposable.
If the NPcombines with a verbal head, it may be partiallycompacted.
In that case, the relative clause's do-main object (El) is inserted into the domain of theVP together with the domain object consisting ofthe same SYNSEM value as the original NP and thatNP's phonology minus the phonology of the relativeclause (\[~\]).
By virtue of its \[EXTRA "~-\] marking, thedomain object of the relative clause is now orderedlast in the higher VP domain, while the remnant NPis ordered along the same lines as NPs in general.One important aspect o note is that on this ap-proach, the inalterability condition on domain ob-jects is not violated.
Thus, the domain object ofthe relative clause ( \ [~  in the NP domain is token-identical to the one in the VP domain.
Moreover,the integrity of the remaining NP's domain objectis not affected as--unlike in Nerbonne's analysis--there is no corresponding domain object in the do-main of the NP before the latter is licensed as thecomplement of the verb fattern.In order to allow for the possibility of partiallycompacting a domain by replacing the compactionrelation of (4) by the p-compaction relation, whichis defined as follows:177I VP , IZ\]/REL-~ L EXTRA -4-\[\] /r,e,ne.,\] \] r' er n,erha"\]DET\[~oM (\[(#,,n~)\])\]^ p-compaction(l-i-l,\[Z\], lID)^ shume(I\[Zl), (~ , l 'q ,~I REL-SEXTRA +v , .

Ross' Right Roof Constraint (Ross,1967)).This approach is superior to Nerhonne's, as theextraposability of an item is correlated onlywithits linear properties (right-peripheral occurrence ina domain via \[EXTRA +\]), but not with its sta-tus as adjunct or complement.
Our approach alsomakes the correct prediction that extraposition isonly possible if the extraposed element is alreadyfinal in the extraposition source.
6 In this sense, ex-traposition is subject o a monotonicity condition tothe effect that the element in question has to occurin the same linear relationship in the smaller andthe larger domains, viz.
right-peripherally (moduloother extraposed constituents).
This aspect clearlyfavors our approach over alternative proposals thattreat extraposition i terms of a NONLOCAL depen-dency (Keller, 1994).
In approaches of that kind,there is nothing, for example, to block extrapositionof prenominal elements.Our approach allows an obvious extension to thecase of extraposition from PPs which are prob-lematic for Nerbonne's analysis.
Prepositions areprepended to the domain of NPs in the same way6It should be pointed out that we do not  make the as-sumption, often made in transformational grammar, thatcases in which a complement (of a verb) can only occurextraposed necessitates the existence of an underlyingnon-extraposed structure that is never overtly realized.178Iv.

'If we assume, following Kathol (In progress), thattopicalized constituents are part of the same clausaldomain as the rest of the sentence, 7 then an ex-traposed domain object, inherited via partial com-paction from the topic, will automatically have tooccur clause-finally, just as in the case of extraposi-tion from regular complements.So far, we have only considered the case in whichthe extraposed constituent is inherited by the higherorder domain.
However, the definition of the p-compaction relation in (12) also holds in the casewhere the list of liberated omain objects is empty,which amounts to the total compaction of the signin question.
As a result, we can regard total com-paction as a special case of the p-compaction relationin general.
This means that as an alternative lin-earization of (6), we can also have the extraposition-less analysis in Figure 5.Therefore, there is no longer a need for theUNIONED feature for extraposition.
This means thatwe can have a stronger theory as constraints on ex-traposability will be result of general conditions onthe syntactic licensing schema (e.g.
the Right RoofConstraint in (10)).
But this means that whether ornot something can be extraposed has been renderedexempt from lexical variation in principle---unlike inReape's ystem where extraposability is a matter oflexical selection.rI.e.
the initial placement of a preverbal constituent ina verb-second clause is a consequence of LP constraintswithin a flat clausal order domain.Moreover, while Reape employs this feature forthe linearization of nonfinite complementation, itcan be shown that the Argument Compositionapproach of Hinrichs & Nakazawa (Hinrichs andNakazawa, 1994), among many others, is linguisti-cally superior (Kathol, In progress).
As a result, wecan dispense with the UNIONED feature altogetherand instead derive linearization conditions from gen-eral principles of syntactic ombination that are notsubject to lexical variation.5 Conc lus ionWe have argued for an approach to extrapositionfrom smaller constituents that pays specific atten-tion to the linear properties of the extrapositionsource, s To this end, we have proposed a more fine-grained typology of ways in which an order domaincan be formed from smaller constituents.
Crucially,we use relational constraints to define the interde-pendencies; hence our approach fits squarely into theparadigm in which grammars are viewed as sets ofrelational dependencies that has been advocated forinstance in DSrre et al (1992).
Since the relationalperspective also lies at the heart of computationalformalisms uch as CUF (DSrre and Eisele, 1991),the ideas presented here are expected to carry overinto practical systems rather straightforwardly.
