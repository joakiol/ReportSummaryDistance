Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms, pages 41?48,Sydney, July 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsPied-Piping in Relative Clauses: Syntax and Compositional Semanticsbased on Synchronous Tree Adjoining GrammarChung-hye HanDepartment of LinguisticsSimon Fraser Universitychunghye@sfu.caAbstractIn relative clauses, the wh relative pro-noun can be embedded in a larger phrase,as in a boy [whose brother] Mary hit.In such examples, we say that the largerphrase has pied-piped along with the wh-word.
In this paper, using a similar syntac-tic analysis for wh pied-piping as in Han(2002) and further developed in Kallmeyerand Scheffler (2004), I propose a composi-tional semantics for relative clauses basedon Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-mar.
It will be shown that (i) the elemen-tary tree representing the logical form ofa wh-word provides a generalized quanti-fier, and (ii) the semantic composition ofthe pied-piped material and the wh-word isachieved through adjoining in the seman-tics of the former onto the latter.1 IntroductionIn relative clauses, the wh relative pronoun can beembedded in a larger phrase, as in (1) and (2).
Insuch examples, we say that the larger phrase con-taining the wh-word has PIED-PIPED along withthe wh-word.
(1) a boy [ [whose brother]i Mary hit ti ](2) a boy [[whose brother?s friend]i Mary hit ti]In this paper, using a similar syntactic analysis forwh pied-piping as in Han (2002) and further devel-oped in Kallmeyer and Scheffler (2004), I proposea compositional semantics for relative clauses ofthe sort illustrated in (1) and (2), based on Syn-chronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG).
Thetwo main components of my proposal are that (i)the semantic tree representing the logical form of awh relative pronoun provides a generalized quan-tifier, and (ii) the semantic composition of thepied-piped material and the wh-word is achievedthrough adjoining of the former onto the latter inthe semantics.
Although TAG semantics for rel-ative clauses based on flat semantics have beenproposed before (Han, 2002; Kallmeyer, 2003), noSTAG-based analysis exists, as far as I know.In section 2, I introduce the framework ofSTAG and STAG-based compositional semanticsand clarify my assumptions.
In section 3, I presentmy analysis of relative clauses and pied-piping.
Iextend the proposed analysis to relative clauses inwhich wh-word is in a PP and those in which nopied-piping has taken place in section 4.2 STAG-based Compositional SemanticsBefore presenting my analysis of relative clauses, Ifirst illustrate the framework of STAG-based com-positional semantics and clarify my assumptions,using a simple sentence that contains an existentialquantifier and an attributive adjective in (3).
(3) John saw a good movie.I use STAG as defined in Shieber (1994).
In anSTAG, each syntactic elementary tree is pairedwith one or more semantic trees that represent itslogical form with links between matching nodes.A synchronous derivation proceeds by mapping aderivation tree from the syntax side to an isomor-phic derivation tree in the semantics side, and issynchronized by the links specified in the elemen-tary tree pairs.
In the tree pairs given in Figure 1,the trees in the left side are syntactic elementarytrees and the ones in the right side are semantictrees.
In the semantic trees, F stands for formulas,R for predicates and T for terms.
I assume thatthese nodes are typed and I represent predicatesas unreduced ?-expressions.
The linked nodes areshown with boxed numbers.
For sake of simplic-ity, in the elementary tree pairs, I only includelinks that are relevant for the derivation of givenexamples.Figure 1 contains elementary trees required togenerate the syntactic structure and the logical41?

All the syntactic elementary trees sat-isfy Frank?s (2002) Condition on Elementary TreeMinimality (CETM), which states that ?the syn-tactic heads in an elementary tree and their projec-tions must form an extended projection of a sin-gle lexical head?
(Frank 2002, p. 54).
Particu-larly, (?a movie) is a valid elementary tree, as anoun can form an extended projection with a DP,in line with the DP Hypothesis.
The proper nametree in (?John) is paired with a tree representinga term in the semantics, and the attributive adjec-tive tree in (?good) is paired with an auxiliary treein the semantics that represents a one-place predi-cate to be adjoined to another one-place predicate.As for the syntax-semantics pairing of elementarytrees for quantified DPs, I follow Shieber and Sch-abes (1990), and use Tree Local Multi-ComponentTAG (as defined in Weir (1988)) in the seman-tics.
Thus, the DP in (?a movie) is paired with amulti-component set {(?
?a movie), (?
?a movie)}in the semantics: (?
?a movie) provides an argu-ment variable, and (?
?a movie) provides the ex-istential quantifier with the restriction and scope.The transitive tree in (?saw) is paired with a se-mantic tree representing a formula that consists ofa two-place predicate and two term nodes.
Thelinks, shown with boxed numbers, guarantee thatwhatever substitutes into DPi, the correspondingsemantic tree will substitute into the term nodemarked with 1 , and whatever substitutes into DPis paired up with a multi-component set in the se-mantics where one of the components will substi-tute into the term node marked with 2 and theother will adjoin onto the F node marked with2 .
The syntactic and semantic derivation treesare given in Figure 2, and the derived trees aregiven in Figure 3.
I leave out the tree addressesin the semantic derivation tree, as these are deter-mined by the links between the syntactic and se-mantic elementary trees.1?

In the syntaxside, (?who) substitutes into DPj in (?hit), and thepied-piping of the rest of the DP is achieved by ad-joining (?
?s brother) onto (?who).
The tree in (?
?sbrother) is a widely-accepted genitive structure ac-cording to the DP hypothesis, where the genitive ?sheads the DP tree.
This satisfies CETM, as a DPis an extended projection of a noun.
Substituting(?mary) into DPi in (?hit) completes the deriva-tion of the relative clause.The derivation tree for the relative clause is in(?1) in Figure 5 and the derived tree is in (?1) inFigure 6.?

?Mary)?Figure 5: Derivation trees for whose brother MaryhitSemantically, we must make sure that the vari-able coming from the wh-word is also the one be-ing predicated of the head noun (boy in (1)), andyet the same variable does not serve as an argu-ment of the predicate (hit in (1)) in the relativeclause.
I argue that the introduction of a gener-alized quantifier (GQ) node in the semantic tree in(?
?who) and adjoining of (??
?s brother) onto theGQ node guarantee this.
I define the logical formof a wh relative pronoun as an auxiliary tree givenin (??who).
In (?
?who), ?x binds x in the gen-eralized quantifier, ?P.P (x).
Adjoining (?
?who)onto the relative clause elementary tree in (?
?hit)essentially has the effect of abstracting over thevariable coming from the wh-word in the relativeclause, turning it into a one-place predicate.
Thistherefore ensures that the relative clause and thehead noun are predicating over the same variable,deriving the interpretation of the relative clauseas a modifier of the head noun.
The meaning ofthe pied-piped material ?s brother is added ontothe meaning of who by adjoining the auxiliarytree defined in (??
?s brother) onto the GQ nodein (??who).
In (??
?s brother), ?y ensures that thevariable coming from the DP* (who) is in somerelation with the variable coming from the headof the pied-piped DP (whose brother), and ?Q, byturning whose brother into a GQ, ensures that thevariable coming from the head of the pied-pipedDP is the argument of the predicate that the DPcombines with.
The derivation tree and the de-rived tree in the semantics side are given in (?
?1)in Figure 5 and (?
?1) in Figure 6.
After all the ?-conversions have applied, (?
?1) can be reduced tothe expression in (6).

and Mary hit z?.
As the seman-tics of relative clauses is defined to be a one-placepredicate, it is analogous to attributive adjectives.This means that the semantic tree resulting fromthe adjoining of (?

(11) a boy [ [DP the brother of whom]i Mary hitti ]For the derivation of (11), we need to change twoof the elementary tree pairs in Figure 4 slightly.The elementary tree pairs <(?who), (?
?who)>and <(?
?s brother), ??
?s brother)> need to be re-placed with the pairs in Figure 10.
Since the rel-ative pronoun in (11) is whom, we use a DP treeanchoring whom in (?whom).
The correspondingsemantic tree (?
?whom) remains exactly the sameas before.
(?the brother of) represents the pied-piped material in DP.
It is a well-formed elemen-tary tree according to CETM as it has a single lexi-cal head brother and DP is an extended projectionof this head, and PP is not subject to CETM be-cause P is a functional head, not a lexical head.Moreover, DP* is licensed as it is an argumentof the lexical head brother, as argued in Kroch(1989).
The semantics of the brother of whom isequivalent to whose brother, and therefore, we pairup (?the brother of) with the exact same semantictree as (??
?s brother).The derivation trees for the relative clause in(11) are given in Figure 11.
They look exactly thesame as the ones for the relative clause in (1), ex-cept for names of the elementary trees in a fewnodes.
The derived trees are given in Figure 12.While the syntactic derived tree (?11) is differentfrom (?1) in Figure 6 in the structure of DP con-taining the pied-piped material, the semantic de-rived tree (?
?11) looks exactly the same as (?
?1)in Figure 6.
This is as it should be given that themeaning of (1) and the meaning of (11) are equiv-alent.45?

When the larger DP containing the relativepronoun is indefinite or non-specific, the DP canbe stranded, as in (12).
This gives us a configura-tion where a wh-word has extracted out of a DP.
(12) a boy [whomi Mary hit [DP a brother of ti]]Since we now have a DP with an indefinitearticle, a tree pair in Figure 13 is needed, forthe derivation of (12).
Using the semantic tree(?
?a brother of), the semantic composition of therelative clause in (12) can proceed as before: thesemantic tree (?
?a brother of) adjoins onto the se-mantic tree (?
?whom) in Figure 10, which thenadjoins onto (?
?hit) in Figure 4.
In the syntax,however, we must make sure that (?a brother of)does not adjoin onto the relative pronoun whom,because if it did, we would end up with the stringa brother of whom.
Instead, what we need isfor (?a brother of) to adjoin onto the DP domi-nating the trace of the extracted object in (?hit).This however is not a valid derivation in STAG,as elementary trees in a single pair are composingwith two trees from two different pairs.
A slightmodification in the syntactic elementary tree for(?whom) in Figure 14 can fix this problem.
I pro-pose to do this by turning (?whom) into a multi-component set {(?whom), (?whom)} as in Fig-ure 14.

And in semantics, (?
?whom) adjoins onto(?
?hit) as before, as shown in (?
?12) in Figure15.
Subsequently, in syntax (?a brother of) ad-joins onto (?whom) giving us the DP a brother oftj , and in semantics (?
?a brother of) adjoins onto(??whom).
Thus, by using the multi-componentset {(?whom), (?whom)}, we now have a situ-ation where two elementary trees in a single pairare composing with two trees belonging to anotherpair.
The syntactic and the semantic derived treesare given in Figure 16.
After ?-conversions, (?

Further, the impossibility of the strandingof subject DP, as in *a boy whomi [a brother of ti] hit Mary,can be handled by placing an NA constraint on the subjectDP dominating a trace in the relative clause tree.47?

The main ingredients of the proposedanalysis are: in syntax, the pied-piped material ad-joins to the wh-word, and in semantics, the wh-word provides a GQ to which the meaning of thepied-piped material adjoins.
I have also shownthat similar analysis can handle cases in which thewh-word alone has moved to [Spec,CP], strand-ing the rest of the DP in situ, if we use a multi-component set containing a degenerate DP for thesyntax of the relative pronoun.
The proposed anal-ysis utilizes composition operations in semanticsthat are already available in syntax, substitutionand adjoining, thereby making syntax-semanticsmapping in TAG simple and straightforward.AcknowledgmentI thank Anoop Sarkar and the three anonymous re-viewers for their insightful comments.ReferencesRobert Frank.
