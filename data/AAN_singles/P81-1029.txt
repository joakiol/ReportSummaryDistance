This isknown as the  Al ignment  Problem.\ [Lev ln\ ]Sect loo One of  thls paper gives anoverv iew of a genera l ly  accepted approach tosemant ic  process ing that goes through severallevels of  representat ion  to achieve thismapping.

These impl icat ions  ared icuesed in Sect ion Three.

These levels are used to br idge thegap between the surface syncact lcrepresentat ion  and the  "deep" conceptua lrepreseoCat lon  necessary  for communicat ingwlth the Incernal  database.

\ [Novak\ ]  Once apart icu lar  sentence has marched a schema, itis useful  to  rephrase the in format ion in amore "canonica l"  form, so Chac a s ingle ofinference rules can apply Co a group ofschemas.1.2  Canon ica l  Leve l  Th is  in termediate  leve lo f  representat ion  usua l ly  cons is ts  o f  theverb  i t se l f ,  (o r  perhaps  a more  pr imi t ivesemant ic  p red icate  chosen  to  represent  theverb)  and a l i s t  o f  poss ib le  ro les ,  e .g .a rguments  to  the  pred icate .

A verb such  as  SUPPORT wouldrequire several  pred icates  in an equ i l ib r iumdomain.

TheSUBJ of the schema level is renamed<physobJ>1 or pl at the canonica l  level, andis st i l l  pl at the pred icate  level.One way of v iewing the schemas is asl ea f  nodes  produced by a dec is ion  t ree  thatstarts at the pred icate  level.
The levels ofthe tree cor respond to the d i f ferentsyntact ic  const i tuents  that can map onto thearguments  of the or ig ina l  set of predicates .Since more than one argument can be renamedas a part icu lar  syntact ic  const i tuent ,  therecan be more than one branch at each level.If a semant ic  argument might not be ment ionedexp l ic i t ly  in the syntact ic  conf igurat ion,this also has to  be  expressed as a rule, ex.pl -> NULL.
(Ex.
"The scaf fo ld  issupported."
)  When all of the branches havebeen taken, each terminal  node represents  theset of dec is ions cor respond ing  to  apar t icu lar  schema.
(See Append ix  A.)
Notethat the canonica l  level never has co beexpressed expl ic i t ly .
By work ing top downinstead of bot tom up unnecessary  dup l icat ionof inference rules iS automat ica l ly  avoided.The in format ion  in the or ig ina l  threelevels can be stored equ iva lent ly  as the topnode of the dec is ion tree along with therenaming rules for the semant ic  arguments(rewrite rules).
This would reverse  theorder of analys is  from the bottom-up modesuggested in sect ion one to a cop-down mode.This uses a more compact representat ion,  butwould be computat iona l ly  less ef f ic ient .Growing the ent ire dec is ion tree every time asentence needed to be matched would be quitecumbersome.
However,  if only the path to thecorrect terminal  node needed to be generated,this approach would be computat lona l lycompet i t ive.
By order ing the dec is ionsaccord ing to  syntact ic  precedence,  and byusing the data from the sentence in quest ionto prune the tree WHILE it is beinggenerated,  the correct  dec is ions can usual l lybe made, with the only path explored beingthe  path to  the  cor rec t  schema.2.2 Context  Sens i t ive Constra ints  Contextsens l t iv i ty  can be preserved by only a l lowingthe p2->OPPP rule to apply after a mappin Sfor Iptl has been found, ev idence that anIpt l ->OBJ  rule could have already appl ied.To tes t  whether  such a mapping has been madegiven a LOCPT predicate,  it is only necessarytO see if the iptl argument has been renamedby a syntact ic  const i tuent .
The renamingprocess can be thought of as an ins tant la t lonof typed var iab les ,  - the semant ic  argumentsby syntact ic  const i tuents .
\[Palmer,Gal l ler ,  and Welner\] Then the fo l lowingprecond i t ions  must be sat is f ied beforeapply ing the p2->OFPP rule: ( /\ stands forAND)p2->OFPP/  LOCPT( Ipt l ,p2)/\ not (var lab le ( ip t l ) )These precond i t ions  wi l l  st i l l  need tobe sat is f ied when a LOCPT predicate is partof another verb representat ion.
Anyt ime a<locpart> is ment ioned It can be fo l lowed byan OFPP in t roduc ing  the  <physob J> of which  I ti s  a locat ion  par t .
Th is  re la t ionsh ipbetween a < locparc> and a <physob J> i s  Jus tas  va l id  when the  verb  i s  "hang"  o r"connect . "
Ex .
"The  pu l ley  i s  connected  tothe  r ight  end  o f  the  s t r ing . "
" The par t i c leis hung from the r ight  end of the str ing.
"These par t icu lar  const ra ints  are general  tothe domain rather than being restr icted to"support ' .
This i l lustetes  the e f f lc lency ofassoc ia t ing  const ra ints  with semant icpredicates  rather than verbs,  a l lowing formore advantage to be taken of genera l i t ies .There is an obvious resemblance here tothe  notat ion used for Local Constra intsgrammars \[Joshi and Levy\]:p2->OFPP/  DOM(LOCPT)  /\LMS( Ipt l )  /\ not (var( ipt l ) )DOM - DOMinate,LMS - Left Most S isterI t  can  be  demonst ra ted  that  the  contextsens i t ive  const ra in ts  p resented  here  are  asimple specia l  case of their LocalConstra ints ,  s ince the dominat ing  node isl imited to being the immediate predicatehead.
Whether  o r  not  such  a res t r i c ted  loca lcontext  will  prove  suf f ic ient  fo r  morecomplex domains remains to  be  proven.2.3 Overv iew As i l lus t ra ted  above, ourmappings from syntact i c  const i tuents  tosemant ic  a rguments  can  be  found d i rec t ly ,thus gain ing f lex ib i l i ty  and un i formitywithout  losing context  sens i t iv i ty .
Once theverb has been recognized,  the semant icpred icates  represent ing the verb can dr ivethe se lect ion of renaming rules direct ly,avo id ing the necess i ty  of an intermediatelevel of representat ion .
The contextualdependenc ies  or ig ina l ly  captured by theschemes are preserved in precondi t ions  thatare assoc iated with the app l icat ion  of therenaming rules.
Since the renaming rules andthe precond i t ions  refer only to semant icpredicates  and arguments  to the predicates,there is a sense in which they arei ndependent  of ind iv idua l  verbs .
By app ly ingonly those rules that are relevant to thesentence in quest ion,  the correct mappingscan be found quickly and ef f ic ient ly .
Theresul t ing system is h ighly f lexible,  sincethe  same pred icates  a re  used  in  therepresentat ion  o f  a l l  the  verbs ,  and  many o fthe  precond i t ions  a re  genera l  to  the  domain .This fac i l l i tates  the addi t ion of s imi larverbs since most of the  necessary  semant icpred icates  with the appropr ia te  renamingrules wil l  a l ready be present.1273.0 THE ROLE OF CASE INFORMATIONA l though the canon ica l  level has oftenbeen v iewed as the case frame level, doingaway with the canon ica l  level does notnecessar i l y  imply chat cases are no longerre levant  to semant ic  p rocess ing .
On thecont rary ,  the  impor tance  here of syntacc lccues for in t roduc ing  semant ic  a rgumentsp laces even more emphas is  on the t rad i t iona lnoc lon of case.
The suggest ion  is chat theappropr ia te  level for case in format ion  is infact the pred icate  level,  and that mostc rad lC lona l  cases should be seen as argumentsto  c lear ly  def ined semant ic  p red icates .These  pred icates  a re  no~ mere ly  thes imp le  set  of  f l a t  p red icates  ind icated  inthe  prev ious  sect ions .
There  i s  an imp l i c i ts t ruc tur ihg  to  chat  se t  of pred icatesind icated  by the  imp l i ca t ions  ho ld ing  betweenthem.
A SUPPORT re la t ionsh ip  impl ies  theex is tence  of UP and DOWN forces and a CONTACTre la t ionsh ip .
A CONTACT re la t ionsh ip  impl iesthe  ex is tence of LOCPT's  and a SAMEPLACEre la t ionsh ip  between them.
The set ofpred icates  descr ib ing  "suppor t "  can  beproduced  by expand ing  the  imp l i ca t ions  o f  theSUPPORT(p l ,p2)  p red icate  in to  UP( f l ,p l )  andDOWN(f2 ,p2)  and CONTACT(p l ,p2) .CONTACT(p l ,p2)  is in turn expanded intoLOCPT( Ip t l ,p l )  and LOCPT( ip t2 ,p2)  andSAMEPLACE( Ip I , Ip t2 ) .
These def ln ic lons ,  orexpans ions ,  are represented  as the fo l lowingrewr i te  rules:supporc<->SUPPORT(p l ,p2)SUPPORT(p l ,p2)<->UP( f I ,p I ) / \DOWN(f2 ,p2)/ \CONTACT(p l ,p2)CONTACT(p l ,p2)<->LOCPT( IpC I ,p I ) / \ LOCPT( Ip t2 ,p2)/ \SAMEPLACE(p l ,p2)When "suppor t "  has  been  recogn ized  asthe  verb ,  these  ru les  can  be app l ied ,  tobui ld  up the set of semant ic  p red icatesneeded to  represent  suppor t .
I f  there  wereexpans ions  for UP and DOWN they could beapp l ied  as wel l .
As the rules are be ingapp l ied  the mapp ings  of  syntact icconst i tuents  to pred icate  arguments  can bemade at the same time, as each argument  isin t roduced.
The case in format ion  is notmere ly  the set of semant ic  p red icates  or Justthe SUPPORT(p I ,p2)  p red icate  alone.
Rather ,the  case in format ion  is represented  by theset  of pred icates ,  the  dependenc ies  ind icatedby the  expans ions  fo r  the  pred icates ,  and therenaming rules that arm needed to f led theappropr ia te  mapp ings .
The renaming  ru lescor respond to  the  t rad i t iona l  syntact i c  cuesfo r  in t roduc ing  par t i cu la r  cases .

Without denying the ext remelyusefu l  tles between syntact ic  const l tuencssod semant ic  cases, Jackendof f  quest ions theabi l lcy  of case to  capture complex semant icre lat ionsh ips .
\ [ Jackendoff\]  His mainob ject ion  is that s tandard case theory doesnot a l low a noun phrase to be ass igned morethan one case.
In examples l lke "Esau tradedh ls  b i r th r ight  ( to  Jacob)  fo r  a mess  o fpottage,"  Jackendof f  sees two relatedact ions:  "The f irst is the change of handsof the b i r thr ight  from Esau to Jacob.
Thedirect object is Theme, the sub~ect  isSource, and the to -ob jec t  is Goal.
Alsothere is what I wi l l  cal l  the secondaryact ion, the changlnS of hands of the mess ofpot tage  in  the  ocher  d i rec t ion .
In  th i sac t ion ,  the  fo r -phrase  i s  Secondary  Theme,the  sub ject  is Secondary  Goal, and theto-phrase is Secondary Source."
\[p.35\] This,of course, could not be captured by aF i l lmore- l lke  case frame.
Jackendof fconcludes that, "A theory of case grammar inwhich each noun phrase has exact ly  onesemant ic  funct ion in deep st ructure  cannotprovide deep st ructures  which sat is fy  thestron S Katz -Posta l  Hypothes is ,  that is, whichprovide all semant ic  in format ion  about thesentence."
Jackendoff  i s  sot complete lyd lscard ln  E case in format ion,  but rathersuggest ing a new level of semant icrepresentat ion  that tr ies to incorporate  someof the advantages of case.
Mak ingconst ruct ive  use of Gruber 's  system ofthematic re lat ionsh ips  \[Gruher\],  Jackendof fpostu lates  "The thematic re lat ions can now bedef ined in terms of \[these\] semant icsubfunct lons.

Examplesentences are "A par t ic le  is hung by a str ingfrom a pul ley,"  and "A par t ic le  is connectedto  another  par t i c le  by  a s t r ing . "
Thefo l lowing rewri te rules ere the expans ionsfo r  the  "hang"  and  "connect  ?

The app l i ca t ion  of this expans ionto the above representat ions  results in:LOCATION(par t i c le l , s t r ing)LOCATION(s t r lng ,pu l lay l )andCONTACT(par t i c le l , s t r ins )CONTACT(sCr lng ,par t l c la2)These  pred icates  can  then  be  expanded,w i th  LOCATION br ing ing  in  SUPPORT andCONTACT, and  CONTACT br ing ing  in  LOCPT.3 .4  Poss ib le  Imp l i ca t ions  There  seams to  be  ad i rec t  connect ion  between the  prev iousexpans ion  of in termediary  and the analys is  ofthe INSTRUMENT case done by  Beth Levln atMIT.
\ [Lev ln \ ]  She po inted  out a d is t inctd i f fe rence  in the  use of the  same INSTRUMENTin the  fo l lowing two sentences:" John cut his foot with a rock.
""John cut his foot on a rock.
"In the first sentence there is animpl i cat ion  that John was in some way"contro l l ing"  the cutt ing of his foot ,  andus ing  the  rock  to  do  so .
In  the  secondsentence there is no such  impl icat ion,  andJohn  probab ly  cut  h i s  foot  acc identa l ly .
Theuse  o f  the  "w i th"  prepos i t ion  marks  the  rockas  an  INSTRUMENT.
that  i s  be ing  man ipu la tedby  John ,  whereas  "on"  in t roduces  an  unmarkedINSTRUMENT with no impl ied  ra la t ionsh ion  toJohn.
It would seem that someth ing llke theexpans ion for EFFECT could he lp  to capturepar t  of what is being impl ied by the"control"  re la t ionsh ip .
Br ing ing  in thet rans i t iv i ty  re la t ionsh ip  makes expl ic i t  aconnect ion  between John and the rock as wellas between the foot and the rock.
~n thesecond sentence on ly  the connect ion  betweenthe foot and the rock is impl ied.
Theconnect ion  impl ied here is cer ta in ly  morecompl icated  than a s imple  CONTACTre lat ionsh ip ,  and would neccsss i ta te  a moredeta i led unders tand ing  of "cut."
But  thesuggest ion  of "control"  is at  least ind icatedby the embedd ing  of the  CUT pred icate  wi th inEFFECT and CAUSE.CAUSE( John ,EFFECT( rock , (CUT( foot -o f - John) ) )The tie between the AGENT and theINSTRUMENT is another  imp l i cat ion  of"cont ro l "  that  shou ld  be  exp lored .That the d i s t inc t ion  between marked andunmarked INSTRUMENTS can be captured by theEFFECT re lat ionsh ip  is i l lust rated by theprocess ing  of the fo l lowing two sentences:"The part ic le  is hung from a pul ley by astr ing.
""The par t ic le  is hung on a str ing.
"In the first sentence an "inter" (amarked INSTRUMENT) is suppl ied by the BYPP,and the fo l lowing representat ion  is produced:EFFECT(s t r ing ,LOCATION(par t l c le ,pu l ley ) )In the second sentence no "inter" isfound, and in the absence of an "inter" theEFFECT re la t ionsh ip  cannot  be expanded.
TheLOCATION(par t i c le , s t r lng)  pred icate  is leftto stand alone and is in turn expanded.
(TheONPP can indicate a "lot.

)The int r igu ing poss ib i l i ty  of verbindependent  def in i t ions  for cases requiresmuch more exp lorat ion .
\[Charniak\] Thesuggest ion  here is that a deeper level ofrepresentat ion ,  the  pred icate  leve l ,  isappropr ia te  fo r  invest igat ing  caseimpl icat ions ,  and that impor tant  cases llkeAGENTS and INSTRUMENTS have impl icat ions  fo rmats - leve l  s t ructur ing  of those pred icates .3.5 Summary In summary,  there is a surpr is ingamount of in fo rmat ion  a t  the semant icpred icate  level that a l lows syntact icconst i tuents  to  be  mapped d i rec t ly  ontosemant ic  a rguments .
Th is  resu l ts  in  asemant ic  p rocesser  that  has  the  advantage  o fbe ing  easy  to  bu i ld  and  more  f lex ib le  thanex is t ing  processers .
