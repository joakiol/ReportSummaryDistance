Posters and Demonstrations, pages 99?102Manchester, August 2008On the weak generative capacity of weighted context-free grammars?Anders S?gaardUniversity of Potsdamsoegaard@ling.uni-potsdam.deAbstractIt is shown how weighted context-freegrammars can be used to recognize lan-guages beyond their weak generative ca-pacity by a one-step constant time exten-sion of standard recognition algorithms.1 IntroductionWeighted context-free grammars (WCFGs) areused to disambiguate strings and thus filter outsubsets of the tree languages of the underlyingcontext-free grammars (CFGs).
Weights can ei-ther be used as probabilities, i.e.
higher weights arepreferred, or as penalities, i.e.
lower weights arepreferred.
The first convention, also followed bySmith and Johnson (2007), is followed here.
Thesubsets of the tree languages that consist of theheaviest tree for each yield are called the Viterbitree languages.
String languages are the yields oftree languages, and Viterbi string languages are theyields of Viterbi tree languages.Infante-Lopez and de Rijke (2006) show that theViterbi tree languages strictly extend the tree lan-guages.The idea explored in this paper is simple.
Iftrees must have particular weights for their yieldsto be recognized, weights can be used to en-code non-local dependencies.
Technically, the{r1, .
.
.
, rn}-language is defined as all the stringsfor which the heaviest, i.e.
most probable, treehas weight ri?
{r1, .

, rn}.
It is shown thatthis class of languages includes common classes?Thanks to Mark Hopkins, Daniel Quernheim and theanonymous reviewers for helpful comments.?c?

In other words,standard Viterbi-style recognition algorithms forWCFGs can be used to recognize these classesby a one-step look-up that checks if the weightof the heaviest tree is in {r1, .

Sect.
3 gives a rough characterization ofthe class of languages that can be {r1, .

.
.
, rn}-recognize context-free languages.
Their results are extended inSect.
4.
It is shown that WFSAs can also beused to {r1, .
.
.
, rn}-recognize context-sensitivelanguages.
It is shown, however, that the non-context-free languages that can be {r1, .
.
.
, rn}-recognized by WCFGs strictly extend the non-context-free languages that can be {r1, .
.
.
, rn}-recognized by WFSAs.Sect.
5 discusses a more exact characterizationof the weak generative capacity of WCFGs in thisview.
Coprime WCFGs (CWCFGs), i.e.
a subclassof WCFGs where the weights can be partitionedinto reciprocal coprimes, are introduced.
It is con-jectured that the infinite hierarchy of k-CWCFGsis non-collapsing, and the classes of languages thatcan be {r1, .
.
.
, rn}-recognized by k-CWCFGs arecharacterized in terms of an untraditional modifi-99cation of indexed grammars.1.1 PreliminariesA CFG is a 4-tuple G = ?N,T, P, S?

.3 Bounds on weak generative capacityThe first result of this paper is the following:Theorem 3.1.
The BWCFLs strictly extend thecontext-free languages.Proof.
It is not difficult to see that any context-freelanguage is a BWCFL.
Simply construct a WCFGG = ?G?, ??
for any CFG G?
= ?N,T, P, S?such that the weight associated with each produc-tion rule in P is 11.
It then holds that L{11}(G) =L(G?
).The other direction is not very difficult either.It is shown that {anbncn | n ?
0}, whichis non-context-free by the Bar-Hillel lemma, isa BWCFL.
The language is, for instance, theset of strings L{11}(G) for the WCFG G =??
{S, S?
}, {a, b, c}, P, S?, ??
where P is the fol-lowing set of production rules, and ?
assigns theweights in the left column to the items in the rightcolumn:12: S ?

0}.It is not difficult to see that the BWCFLs area subset of the context-sensitive languages.
Thisfollows from the fact that the left-most derivationsin the Viterbi tree languages of WCFGs are linearin the length of the input string; in other words,BWCFLs can be recognized in nondeterministiclinear space and thus by a linear bounded automa-ton.
Since any language that can be represented bya linear bounded automaton is context-sensitive,the BWCFLs must be a subset of the context-sensitive ones.The set of BWCFLs is also a subset of the rangeconcatenation languages (Boullier, 1998) by theobservation made in the introduction that they canbe recognized in polynomial (i.e.
cubic) time bystandard algorithms and a one-step inspection ofthe weight of the heaviest tree; and by the factthat the range concatenation languages are exactlythe languages that can be recognized in polynomialtime (Boullier, 1998).4 Weighted finite-state automataCortes and Mohri (2000) showed, in similar work,that WFSAs can be used to recognize context-free,i.e.
non-regular, languages.Example 4.1.
The weighted finite-state automa-ton T = ?
{q0, q1}, {a, b}, ?, q0, {q1}?

(q0, ?)
= q121: ?
(q1, b) = q1It is not difficult to see that the stringsab, aabb, .
.
.
have derivations with weights 11,whereas the string aab, for example, only has aderivation with weight 12.
Since 12/?
{11}, aab /?L{11}(T ).Cortes and Mohri (2000) also formulated an ex-tension of WFSAs over cross-products of semi-rings that recognized certain context-sensitive,i.e.
non-context-free languages, but their resultscan be considerably extended.
The automatonin Example 4.2, for example, even recognizes alanguage conjectured to be outside the linear in-dexed languages, namely the MIX language (Gaz-dar, 1988).Example 4.2.
The weighted finite-state automa-ton T = ?
{q0, q1, q2, q3}, {a, b, c}, ?, q0, {q0}?with the following ?-transitions {11}-recognizesthe MIX language:18: ?
(q0, a) = q118: ?
(q1, a) = q218: ?
(q2, a) = q31125: ?
(q0, b) = q11125: ?
(q1, b) = q21125: ?
(q2, b) = q31729: ?
(q0, c) = q11729: ?
(q1, c) = q21729: ?
(q2, c) = q39031: ?
(q3, ?)
= q0This example is a bit more complicated.
Notethat 8 ?

729 = 903.
The stringscab, bcabac, .
.
.
have derivations with weights 11,since 9038?125?729=11, whereas the string cababa,for instance, has no derivations with weight 11.
Thestring cababa has exactly one derivation whoseweight is 90382?125.5 Coprime WCFGsA 2-CWCFG is a WCFG over subsets of the ratio-nal numbers C = { 1n| n ?

)such that there is a bijection from the productionrules onto themselves such that if a production rulehas weight 11it is projected onto itself, and oth-erwise, i.e.
if it has weight 1mwith m 6= 1 it isprojected onto a production rule with weight m1.A k-CWCFG for k ?
1 is now the extension ofCWCFG where the sets of production rules theproduct of whose weights is 1, can be of size atmost k, e.g.
the WFSA in Example 4.2 is a 3-CWCFG.The infinite hierarchy of k-CWCFGs seems tobe non-collapsing.
A k-CWCFG {r1, .

0}, butnot {an1.
.
.
an2k+1| n ?
0}.
It has this propertyin common with k-multiple context-free grammars(Seki et al, 1991).
2-CWCFG can be shown to beweakly equivalent with the extension of linear in-dexed grammars (LIGs) (Gazdar, 1988) where thestack is a multiset or a bag that is globally accessi-ble and not just along spines.
The universal recog-nition problem for this extension of LIGs can beshown to be NP-complete by reduction of the ver-tex cover problem, similar to S?gaard et al (2007).The generalization to k-CWCFG requires stacks ofstacks, but is otherwise relatively straight-forward.6 ConclusionsIt was shown how weighted context-free grammarscan be used to recognize languages beyond theirweak generative capacity by a one-step constanttime extension of standard recognition algorithms.The class of languages that can be recognized thisway strictly extends the context-free languages,but is included in the cubic time recognizable ones.Boullier (2000) defines what he calls a ?cu-bic time extension of CFG?
that recognizes gen-eralizations of the copy language that are beyondWCFG.
It remains to be seen if the set of BWCFLsis a strict subset of the set of languages that can berecognized by this formalism.
