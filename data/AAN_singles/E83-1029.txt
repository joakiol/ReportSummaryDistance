NATURAL LANGUAGE INPUT FOR SCENE GENERATION MGiovanni Adorni, Mauro Di ManzoIstituto di Elettrotecnica, University of GenoaViale F.Causa 13, 16145 Genoa, ItalyGiacomo FerrariIstituto di Linguistica Computazionale, CNRVia della Faggiola, 56100 Pisa, ItalyABSTRACTIn this paper a system which understandsand conceptualizes scenes descriptions in naturallanguage is presented.
Specifically, the followingcomponents of the system are described: the syntac-tic analyzer, based on a Procedural Systemic Gram-mar, the semantic analyzer relying on the Conceptu-al Dependency Theory, and the dictionary.I INTRODUCTIONIn this paper a system is presented, which understands and conceptualizes scenes descriptions innatural language (Italian) and produces simple static images of the scenes.
It is part of a largerproject that aims at understanding the descriptionof static scenes, reasoning (in case of incom-pleteness or inconsistency) and dialoguing aboutthem, and finally generating and displaying them.The Input Analyzer (IA) of the system is themost stable end experimented component and it isthe topic of this paper.
It consists of a SyntacticAnalyzer, a Cognitive Data Base (CDB) and a Seman-tic Interpreter.II SYNTACTIC ANALYZERThe syntactic analysis is performed by means ofa Procedural Systemic Grammar (PSG) (McCord,77).The main characteristics of the PSG parser is thatthe operation flow is highly structured, sincedifferent levels of the analysis are associated tothe syntactic units of the sentence.
Five processescan be activated (CLAUSE, COMPL.GR, NOUN.GR, ADJ.GRand VERB.GR) devoted to recognize respectively:(i) the sentences, (ii) the propositional phrases,comparatives, quantification and noun phrases,(iii) the components of the noun phrases, (iv) theadjectives and their modifiers, (v) the verb andits modifiers.Fig.l shows how these processes can interact in ourparser: double arrows indicate message passing andWork supported by M.P.I.

A feature networkis associated to each process, which is activatedtogether with its corresponding processes.In a PASCAL-like language the feature network canbe defined as follows:type FEATURE .

(.LIST OF FEATURES.)...
;LINK=^NODE;NODE=recordNAME:FEATURE;VALUE:boolean;FATHER,NEXT_BROTHER:LINK;FIRST_SON,ALTERNAT:LINK;end;FEATURE NETWORK:array(FEATURE) of LINK;Each NODE represents s feature identified by itsNAME; the ALTERNATE pointer allows the connectionin a Circular list of mutually exclusive featuresas in SHRLDU (Winograd,72).
Each process gives asoutput a fragment of the FEATURE NETWORK manipu-lated to describe the input; this is performed bymeans of a set of functions which test the presence175of a feature in the FEATURE_NETWORK, add and erasefeatures, as described in McCord ('77).
The processis divided into a set of sequential routines,calledSLOTs, analyzing the functional components of aSyntactic Unit.
In the function:function FILLER(ARGI:PROCESS,ARG2:SETOF_FEATURES):boolean;ARGI activates the appropriate process to fill thecaller slot; the second argument of the functionselects the set of features to which the calledprocess must be inizialized.This last features-passing mechanism is absent inthe original PSG; from our experience, we foundit usefull in all the cases in which a choice ina syntactic level is determined by the syperiorlevel or by a more larger context.Thus, for instance, the set of features character-izing a prepositional phrase is determined at thecorresponding syntactic level by the prepositionand the features of the nominal phrase; but furtherand not less important selection criteria can beimposed by the verb which is found in the upperlevel.
The output of a simple analysis is shownin Fig.2; it gives an idea of the syntactic repre-sentation.INPUT: IL M~O GATTO STA MANGIANDO {my ca~ is eat ing)RESULT  OF THE ANALYS IS :T IPO DICHIARAT.TVA ATT IVA (dec la ra~ive  act ive}IL MIO GATTO SOGGETTO {suOJe?~}STA MANG IANDO VERB .

A control structureallowing the parallel computation is:cobegin ... coend;It is a single input-output structure, very usefullto handle alternative choices for the same computa-tional level.
In the case of mutually exclusivealternatives only one of the "n" processes acti-vated by a cobegin control structure can end suc-cessfully.
In the case of not mutually exclusivealternatives, it is still possible to use thecobegin control structure , but it is necessaryto define a strategy for the selection of the mostsuitable alternative when the coend occurs.An experimental implementation in terms of para~lel computation has been made on a multiprocessorsystem (Adorni et ai.,'79).
Another version of thisparser has been implemented in PASCAL (DiManzo etai.,'79} and a version in FranzLisp is in progress.III STRUCTURE OF THE COGNITIVE DATA BASEThe organization o f  knowledge, in this system,is based on a set of THOUGHTs.
A THOUGHT is a framelike structure within which new data are interpret-ed in terms of concepts acquired through previousexperience (Minsky,'75), (Schank,Abelson,'77).Every THOUGHT has a TYPE which determines a setof operations applicable to it.
The followingpredefined types are allowed (Adorni,DiManzo,'83):- DESCRIPTIVE, that defines the complete descrip-tion of a physical,abstract,animate or not,object.- PROTOTYPE, that defines the structural part ofa physical object in terms of generalized cones(Marr,Nishihara,'78).
An example of definition ofsimple prototype object is given in Fig.3.- JOINT, that defines the element of connectionbetween physical objects, in order to build morecomplex objects or scenes (Fig.4).- SPATIALREL, that defines spatial relationshipslike "on,near,on the left of,..." between objects.All the linguistic relationships like "above,under,behind", and so on, are reduced into quantitativegeometrical relationships between the coordinatesof some points of the involved objects; this choiceis motivated by the possibility of deriving a setof very general inference rules from analytic geom-etry (Adorni et ai.,'82), (Boggess,'79), (Boggess,Waltz,'79).
The coordinates of an indefinite pointP are given in the form:COORD K OF P (REFERRED_TO A)=Hwhere K is a group of possible coordinates, H aset of values for these coordinates and A is theTHOUGHT of the object to which the reference systemused is connected.
Fig.5 shows the THOUGHT for anuse of the preposition "on".A spatialrel type THOUGHT can contain conceptu-alizations and prototype THOUGHTs; a joint typecan contain only its description; a prototype typecan contain joint or prototype THOUGHTs or descrip-tions in terms of generalyzed cones;all these typescan be enclosed in a descriptive type which cancontain conceptualizations and all the types ofTHOUGHTs, previously introduced.
A descriptive typecan include the following fields (Adorni,DiManzo,'83), (see Fig.6):- DESCR, contains all the basic not specializedknowledge about the object;- LEVELS, contains a description of the shape ofthe object (in terms of prototype THOUGHTs)divided in different levels of detail hier-archically organized;- USE, contains the descriptions of the most commonactivities involving the use of the object,in terms of spatialrel between prototypeTHOUGHTs;176FIG.3 - Example of Def in i t ion of a Simple PrototypeFIG.4 - Def in i t ion of a Simple Jo int ing Element and Use of this Elementto bui ld a More Complex Object177- POSITION, gives the most common spatial relationsbetween the described object and other ob-jects in standard scenes, in terms of a spa-tialrel between prototype THOUGHTs;- SUPPORT, contains the indication, in terms ofdescriptive THOUGHTs, of the objects whichare supported in standard situations;- COLOR and MADE, describe the possible set of col-ors and materials, while WEIGHT containsinformation about the range of possibleweights;- CONTENT, says, in terms of descriptive THOUGHTs,that the normal use of the object is a con-tainer for other objects;- DYNAMIC, contains the current expectations aboutthe boundaries of the dimensions of the ob-jects; it can be dinamically updated everytime a new object of the same class entersthe system's CDB.IV SEMANTIC INTERPRETERThe Semantic Interpreter of the IA interactswith the Syntactic Analyzer and operates on a setof rules in order to build the concepts a sentencewas intended to mean.
The output of this moduleis a Conceptual Dependency Network (Schank,'75),in which every nominal is substituted by a complexdescriptive THOUGHT instantiated from the CDB.Let us illustrate the procedure of analysis con-sidering the following sentence (the translationis word by word in order to reproduce the problemsof Italian):(i) "l'uomo dai capelli grigi e' andato a Romacon l'auto di Giuseppe"(the man with the grey hair has gone toRome with the car of Joseph)The procedure of analysis has several steps:A.
Analysis of Words and Simple PhrasesDuring this step the entities which take partinto the conceptualization are identified.
In factan indexed identifier Xi is associated to each ob-ject referred to in the sentence (each nominal),which points to one or more conceptualizations,contained in the field "descr" of each nominal inthe CDB.
The adjectives contained in the noun phra-ses are also analyzed during this step.
Each o fthem adds some conceptualizations which contributeto further individuate the nominal.
During thisstep personal pronouns are identified as:Xi ~=--> ISA(HUMAN)Temporal and local adverbials are also analyzedin this phase in order to assign to the sentenceconceptualization a time and place identificationaccording to  certain rules described in (Adorniet al,'81).At the end of this step the sentence (i) isrepresented as follows:identifier nominal conceptualizationXl uomo (man) Xl <=~ISA(HUMAN)X2 capelli (hair) X2<==>ISA(HAIR)X3 Roma (Rome) X3~=>ISA(CITY)XS<==>NAME(ROME)X4 auto (car) X4<==>ISA(CAR)X5 Giuseppe (Joseph) X5<==>ISA(HUMAN)X5~-->NAME(JOSEPH)The sentence (i) can then be read:(2) "XI da X2 e' andato a X3 con X4 di X5"(XI from X2 is gone to X3 with X4 of X5)B.
Analysis of ModifiersThe simple phrases of a sentence can either fillconceptual cases of a main conceptualization, thusserving as 'picture producer' (PP), or further ind !ON is spatial~el {AOHB}thoughtbeginCOORD X,Y OF P REFERReD_TO M = COORD X,Y OP 0 REFERREDTO MandP PART(A) and P NUM(>?)

The modi-f iers in a), on the contrary, have a local role,l imited to the PP they are to modify, and theirrelat ion to the sentence structure is marginal.They are, therefore, immediately associated to theircorresponding nominals.
In (2) "da X2" and "di X5"are of this kind and are consequently l inked toX1 and X4 producing:(3) "XI e' andato a X3 con X4"(XI has gone to X3 with X4)In the "descr" f ield of THOUGHTs Xl and X4 thefol lowing information is added:X2 < .

PART OF(X1)X5 <===> OWNERSHIP(X4)The embodying of a modif ier  creates complexPPs or CLUSTERs.
Each CLUSTER has as its HEAD ab) or c) modif ier ,a conceptual index node modif iedby the accessory concepts.In our example "l 'uomo dai capel l i  neri", "a Roma",and "con l 'auto di Giuseppe" are CLUSTERs, in whichthe head is always the leftmost nominal.The decis ion about the embodying of  a modi f ier  intoits head is related to the c lassical  problem ofthe placement of PP's.
In fact, it is not alwaysthe case that a preposit ional  phrase modif ies aconceptual  index node; it is often possible thatit has to be embodied into another accessory modi-fier, as in:"il l ibro del l 'uomo dal cappotto blu"(the book of  the man with the blue coat)If it is defined:md ---> the current phrase;md-i ---> the immediately proceeding phrase;md-2 ---~ the phrase that immediaZely proceedsmd-l;the solut ion is obtained by recursively decidingwether md is to be embodied into md-i or md-2.
Re-cursion is from the lower level.This decis ion is made by a set of  standard generalprocedures associated to preposit ions (di, da, con,per .

and adverbs (sopra, sotto, davanti, die-fro, ...).
Non-standard special ized alternat ivesare act ivated by part icular  nouns and verbs in or-der to treat hidiosyncrasies.
These procedures arewritten as three-steps programs, which accompl ishthe operat ions of:1-LOOKING for compat ib i l i ty  of certain featuresof md,md-l, and md-2.
Typical features are supersetand part-of  relat ions of md's.
A rule may statethat "IF md has a part-of  re lat ion to md-2 THENmd may be embodied into md-2".

Construction of the Main ConceptualizationThe nucleus of a main conceptualization can beassociated in the CDB both to a noun indicatingan action, state or change of state and a verb.In our example, we find the THOUGHT of fig.
8.
Atime identification always related to thepresent (T@), is taken from the syntactic analysisand connected to this conceptualization, thusresulting into:X ~===~ PTR~NS .... OBJ(X) .... DIR((FROM(Z))(TO(Z))) AandINSTR(CONC)andT1 ~ T@If a lexical ambiguity arises, the features assumedby the nominals in the previous steps will helpto desambiguate.A~ARE is descriptive |thou~t ,.descrX~.
:==~PTR~--- OBJ(X)~--- DIR((FR(~(Y))(TO(Z))andD~TR(C~C)endend.FIG.8 - THOUGHT of the verb "andare" (to go).At this step "splitting" of a conceptualizationoften occurs.
In the sentence:"Giovanni d~ un colpo a Maria"(lit.
John gives a blow to Mary)although two nuclei are present (d~ & colpo),never-theless the correct interpretation is "Giovannicolpisce Maria" (John hits Mary), instead of "Gio-vanni trasferisce il possesso dell'oggetto colpoa Maria" (John tansfers the ownership of the object'blow' to Mary)!!
!We have observed that this phenomenon involves con-ceptualizations based on the primitives of "state","action", and "spatial relationship" and reliesonly on the pairs ACTION-STATE, ACTION-SPATIAL RE-LATIONSHIP, and ACTION-ACTION.
The regularitiesruling the formation of these pairs have been foundto depend only upon those conceptual primitives.This keeps the number of rules to be evaluated rea-sonably small, if compared with the number of CDBentries (~600 entries in the present implementa-tion (Adorni et al,'81))~An example will illustrate the mechanism of reduc-tion of the conceptual "splitting" as well as ofdisambiguation.The pair ACTION-SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP may be repre-sented by:"tirare su il braccio"^ AACTION SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP( l i f t  the arm)The compound "tirare su" has the two meanings:- innalzare, a lzare , .

);- confortare, dare sollievo psiehico,...(encourage,console .... );which can be conceptualized respectively:X ..... PTRANS .... OBJ(Y) .... DIR ( (FROM (K))(TO(H) ) )and((COORD Z OF H-  COORD Z OF K)andR(X .....
PROPEL .... OBJ(Y) .... DIR((FROM(NIL))(TO(NIL))))  )X ~ ~ DO ==S(Y(CHANGE STATE((FROM(HAPPINESS(N)})(TO(HAPPINESS(N)))) ) )The context helps disambiguation.In our example, the object of the spatial rela-tionship being a physical object, the first alter-native is selected.
The rule performs a furthercontrol, discovering that the physical object is,in this case, PART OF(HUMAN); the PROPEL primitiveis then substituted by the MOVE primitive.D.
Case Fillin~ in the Main ConceptualizationThe next step performed by the semantic moduleis the filling of the conceptual cases of the mainconceptualization with the THOUGHTs instantiatedduring the previous steps.
Again, standard rulesare associated to prepositions and adverbs andhidiosyncrasies are also treated.
These rules makeuse of messages sent by the syntactic componentand look at the conceptual syntax of the main con-ceptualization.
Through these rules the cluster"conX4" turns out to be 'instrumental' and the follow-ing conceptualization is then produced:(4) X1 .
.
.
.
USE .... OBJ(X4)Since the filler of the instrumental case of themain conceptualization has  to be a conceptual-ization, the rule activated by the "con" modifierfills the instrumental case with (4).In (3), 'a X3' is placed in the destination of thedirective case of the main conceptualization, be-cause preposition 'a' is stated to indicate the180'destination' if the main conceptualization con-tains a PTRANS,PROPEL or MOVE,with empty directivecase; otherwise it indicates 'state'.
"Andare aRoma" is thus distinguished from "essere a Roma"(to be in Rome).
The result, for our example, is:XI< .... PTRANS~--- OBJ(XI)~--- DIR((FROM(NIL))(TO(IN X3)) )The directive case,as shown in the above exampleis not simply filled with a md; it is filled witha "spatial_relationship-md" pair.
This is a generalrule for our system, emphasizing the change of cootdinates caused by an action.
In our example thismeans that the primitive PTRANS has moved the ob-ject to a point whose coordinates are defined within the city of Rome.

Conceptual Analysis of Complex SentencesThe process of semantic interpretation is ap-plied to every clause in the sentence, identifiedby a verb or a noun indicating an action.
Seg-mentation into such clauses or nominalized clausesis obviously performed by the syntactic component,which has also non-standard rules for specificclasses of (modal) verbs like: dovere (must),volere(to want),potere (can),incominciare (to start) ....These verbs constitute a single main conceptual-ization together with the embedded infinitive.Simple composition rules have been defined to com-bine the meaning of clauses (sentences).Thus for conjunction, as in"si alzo',si mise il cappello eapr i '  la porta"(he stood up,put on its hat and opened the door)the main conceptualizations associated to everyproposition are connected by an 'and' relationship.
(si alzo') ......................... T1and(si mise il cappello) T2 >TIand(apri' la porta) T3 >T2A time indication is also associated to every mainconceptualization to emphasize the execution orderof every action.Conceptual analysis of each single clause (sen-tence) is activated by this top level structureand at the end the resulting conceptualizationsare linked one to the other.V CONCLUSIONSIn this paper a system for understanding a natu-ral language input to a scene generator has beendescribed.
It makes use of a conceptual dependencysemantic model, substantially modified in as muchas syntax is kept apart from semantic interpre-tation and a fully formalized dictionary is used,much more complex than the one embodied in Schank'stheory.
The dictionary is particularly orientedto the generation of scenes, and the stress is onthe representation of the structure of objects.The awareness of the structure of the objects isoften intimately related to our capability of understanding the.
meaning of spatial relationships andother complex linguistic expressions.
For instance,the meaning "the cat is under the car" is clear,even if it may depend on the state of the car,moving or parked; on the contrary, the sentence"the cat is under the wall" is not clear, unlessthe wall is crashed or it has a very particularshape.Our model tries to account t~is understandingactivity by means of the following features:- an object is described at several levels of de-tails; in some cases, only a rough definition ofthe object dimensions can be sufficient, whilein other cases a more sophisticated knowledgeabout the structure of the object itself is re-quired;- the characteristic features of an object areemphasized; the recognition of a feature allowsthe activation of particular rules and the gener-ation of hypotheses about the presence of an ob-ject;- the typical relationships among objects aredescribed.The interaction between syntactic and semanticanalyzers seems rather complex, but it providessome valuable solutions to certain crucial pointsof computational linguistics, like PP's placement,conceptual splitting, idioms and preassembled181The syntactic analyzer, working top-down, yeldsa representation of the input sentence in whichinformation about gender, number, person and tenseare recorded and for each function such as subj,obj, time, etc.., the ccrresponding filler is iden-tified, or a list of fillers is given in case ofambiguity.
These two kinds of information areexactly what is usefull for semantic interpretationand are picked up in various steps of the inter-action by the semantic analyzer in order to buildthe main conceptualization and to fill its role.Also MARGIE(Schank,'75) makes some use of syntacticknowledge distributed among lexical definitionsof words.
This solution gives the entire controlto the semantic interpreter and no syntacticfunctional representation is used.
It seems,however,that an intermediate step, keeping the syntacticoutput separate from the semantic one, has theadvantage of avoiding the multiplication of singlepieces of syntactic knowledge.
It also providesa simpler way of dealing with syntactic variantsof the same sentence and a help in identifyingcoreferences.The semantic interpreter works fundamentallybottom-up and, although much is still to be at-tempted, it seems that it can usefully cooperatewith a top-down parser to find the correct inter-pretation.
These practical advantages will be takeninto account also in the future development of thesystem.
In fact it seems that, although no definitesolution has been given to many linguistic problems,the interaction between two fully developped mecha-nisms controlling each other can provide an indi-cation and a frame into which a more compact systemcan be built.In the present version of the system the inter-action between the two modules is strictlysequential.
In a more compact analyzer, syntacticspecialists, i.e.
simplified pieces of grammarspecialized in particular syntactic phenomena, willbe called by semantic interpreter according toopportunity.
This second version is still beingdesigned.VI ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe autors would like to thank Dr. Lina Massonefor her contributions and assistance in the prepa-ration of this paper.VII REFERENCESG.Adorni,F.Cavagnaro,M.DelCanto,M.DiManzo,O.Giuffreand L.Stringa, "Un Analizzatore Sintattico delLinguaggio naturale Italiano per l'ElaboratoreMulti-Mini Associativo EMMA", DOC-ERI-050, ELSAGSpA, Genoa, 1979.G.Adorni,W.Ansaldi,M.DiManzo and L.Stringa,"NAUSICA:NAtural language Understanding System; theItalian language Case Analyzed", Rivista diInformatica ii, 1981, 39-88.G.Adorni,A.Boccalatte and M.DiManzo, "CognitiveModels for Computer Vision", Proc.
