1 continu-ous blocks on each side of the bitext.
Suchdiscontinuous constituents are required for in-ducing certain alignment configurations thatoccur relatively frequently in manually an-notated parallel corpora and that cannot begenerated with less expressive grammar for-malisms.
As part of our investigations con-cerning the minimal k that is required for in-ducing manual alignments, we present a hier-archical aligner in form of a deduction system.We find that by restricting k to 2 on both sides,100% of the data can be covered.1 IntroductionThe most prominent paradigms in statistical ma-chine translation are phrase-based translation mod-els (Koehn et al 2003) and tree-based approachesusing some form of a synchronous context-freegrammar (SCFG) (Chiang, 2007; Zollmann andVenugopal, 2006; Hoang and Koehn, 2010), in par-ticular inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu,1997).
The rules of the translation models are usu-ally learned from word aligned parallel corpora.Synchronous grammars also induce alignments be-tween words in the bitext when simultaneously rec-ognizing words via the application of a synchronousrule (Wu, 1997).
Due to their central role, it is im-portant that a synchronous grammar formalism ispowerful enough to generate all alignment config-urations that occur in hand-aligned parallel corpora(i)a b c db d a c(ii)a ba1 b1 a2 b2(iii)a1 b a2b1 a b2Figure 1: (i) inside-out alignment (Wu, 1997); (ii) cross-serial discontinuous translation unit (S?gaard and Kuhn,2009); (iii) bonbon alignment (Simard et al 2005)that are taken to be a gold standard of translationalequivalence (Wellington et al 2006).The empirical adequacy of phrase-based andSCFG-based translation models has been put intoquestion (Wellington et al 2006; S?gaard andKuhn, 2009; S?gaard and Wu, 2009; S?gaard, 2010)because they are unable to induce certain alignmentconfigurations.
In the alignments in Figure 1, thetranslation units a, b, c, and d cannot be indepen-dently generated by a binary SCFG.
Due to a re-ordering component, phrase-based systems can han-dle (i), but neither (ii) nor (iii).
Those phenomenahowever occur relatively frequently in hand-alignedparallel corpora.
Wellington et al(2006) found thatcomplex structures such as inside-out alignments oc-cur in 5% of English-Chinese sentence pairs and inthe study of S?gaard and Kuhn (2009) between 1.6%(for Danish-English data) and 12.1% (for Danish-Spanish data) of all translation units are discontinu-ous, i.e.
not derivable by ITGs in normal form.As Wellington et al(2006) already noted forinside-out alignments, discontinuous constituentsare required for binary synchronous derivations ofthe alignment configurations under consideration.This is illustrated in Figure 2: the yields of A 268(i) (iii)A 4A 3A 2A 1a b c db d a cA 1A 2A 3A 4A 3A 2A 1a1 b a2b1 a b2A 1A 2A 3Figure 2: Synchronous derivations: co-indexed non-terminals are generated synchronously.
Note that manyother derivations that induce the same alignment struc-tures are possible, but all of them involve at least one dis-continuous constituent.and A 3 in (i) are discontinuous on the target side,in (iii) the yield of A 1 is discontinuous on the sourceside and the yield of A 2 is discontinuous on thetarget side.
We therefore propose to augment tree-based approaches such that they can account for dis-continuous constituents in the source and/or targetderivation.
This implies going beyond the power ofcontext-free grammars.In the monolingual parsing community, linearcontext-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) have beenestablished as an appropriate formalism for the mod-eling of discontinuous structure (Maier and Lichte,2011; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).
LCFRS is an ex-tension of CFG, in which non-terminals can spank ?
1 continuous blocks of a string.
k is termedthe fan-out of the non-terminal.
If k = 1 for allnon-terminals, the grammar is a CFG.
Recent workshows that probabilistic data-driven parsing withLCFRS is indeed feasible and gives acceptable re-sults (Maier, 2010; Evang and Kallmeyer, 2011; vanCranenburgh, 2012; Maier et al 2012; Kallmeyerand Maier, 2013).
It seems timely to transfer thesefindings to statistical machine translation.In this work, we introduce the notion of syn-chronous LCFRS for translation and show how thealignments in Figure 1 are induced.
Since the pars-ing complexity of LCFRS, and thus of synchronousLCFRS as well, depends directly on k, the num-ber of blocks that a non-terminal in the grammarmay span, an investigation concerning the empiri-cally required k is carried out on manually aligneddata.
For this purpose, we present a parallel parserfor an all-accepting synchronous LCFRS that is usedto validate hierarchical alignments for a given k.This extends the work of Wellington et al(2006)and S?gaard (2010) from a methodological point ofview, as will be explained in Section 5.
In particular,we will revise the results that S?gaard (2010) pre-sented concerning the coverage of ITG.
Our exper-iments furthermore include data sets that have notbeen used in previous similar studies.2 Synchronous LCFRS for Translation2.1 LCFRSAn LCFRS1 (Vijay-Shanker et al 1987; Weir,1988) is a tuple G = (N,T, V, P, S) where N isa finite set of non-terminals with a function dim:N ?

For all r ?
P ,every variableX in r occurs exactly once in the left-hand side (LHS) and exactly once in the right-handside (RHS) of r. r describes how the yield of theLHS non-terminal is computed from the yields ofthe RHS non-terminals.
The yield of S is the lan-guage of the grammar.
Figure 3 shows a sampleLCFRS with more explanations.The rank of G is the maximal rank of any of itsrules, and its fan-out is the maximal fan-out of anyof its non-terminals.
G is called a (u, v)-LCFRS ifit has rank u and fan-out v.2.2 Synchronous LCFRSWe define synchronous LCFRS (SLCFRS) in par-allel to synchronous CFG, see for example Satta1We use the syntax of simple range concatenation grammars(Boullier, 1998), a formalism that is equivalent to LCFRS.69A(ab, cd)?

An SLCFRS is a tuple G =(Ns, Nt, Ts, Tt, Vs, Vt, P, Ss, St) where Ns, Ts, Vs,Ss, resp.
Nt, Tt, Vt, St are defined as for LCFRS.They denote the alphabets for the source and tar-get side respectively.
P is a finite set of syn-chronous rewriting rules ?rs, rt,??
where rs and rtare LCFRS rewriting rules based on Ns, Ts, Vs andNt, Tt, Vt respectively, and ?
is a bijective mappingof the non-terminals in the RHS of rs to the non-terminals in the RHS of rt.
This link relation is rep-resented by co-indexation in the synchronous rules.During a derivation, the yields of two co-indexednon-terminals have to be explained from one syn-chronous rule.
?Ss, St?
is the start pair.We call the tuple (Ns, Ts, Vs, Ps, Ss) the sourceside grammar Gs and (Nt, Tt, Vt, Pt, St) the targetside grammar Gt where Ps is the set of all rs in Pand Pt is the set of all rt in P .
The rank u of G isthe maximal rank of Gs and Gt, and the fan-out v ofG is the sum of the fan-outs of Gs and Gt.
We willsometimes write vvGs |vGt to make clear how the fan-out of G is distributed over the source and the targetside.
As in the monolingual case, a correspondinggrammar G is called a (u, v)-SLCFRS.As an example consider the rules in Figure 4.They translate cross-serial dependencies into nestedones.
The rank of the corresponding grammar is 2and its fan-out 42|2.Note that instead of defining an SLCFRS, onecould also set the fan-out of each non-terminal inan LCFRS to ?
2, set dim(S) = 2, and formu-late synchronization between the arguments of thenon-terminals.
The main disadvantage is that thisrequiresNs = Nt.
Furthermore, this seems less per-spicuous than SLCFRS when moving from SCFGto mild context-sensitivity.
Generalized MultitextGrammar (Melamed et al 2004) is another weaklyequivalent grammar formalism.In correspondence to ITG and normal-form ITG(NF-ITG) (S?gaard and Wu, 2009), we say an?A(a, c)?

|n,m > 0}SLCFRS G is in normal form if the following twoconditions hold: (a) the rank of G is at most 2 and(b) for all r ?
P it holds that the LHS argumentsof rs and rt contain either terminals or variables, butno mixture of both.
The grammar in Figure 4 is notin normal form.While ITGs constrain the order of the non-terminals in the RHS of the target side to be in thesame or in the reverse order compared to the non-terminals in the RHS of the source side, we do notimpose such ordering constraints (on the variables)for SLCFRS.
However, it is obvious that a (2, 21|1)-SLCFRS is equivalent to an ITG of rank 2 and thata (2, 21|1)-SLCFRS in normal form is equivalent toa NF-ITG.2.3 Alignment CapacityA translation unit is a maximally connected sub-graph of a given alignment structure.
Typically thisis the smallest unit from which translation mod-els are learned.
During a synchronous derivation,we interpret simultaneously recognized terminals asaligned (Wu, 1997).
They thus correspond to a trans-lation unit.
We call the synchronous derivation treea hierarchical alignment.
Many-to-many alignmentsare interpreted conjunctively.
This means that to in-duce a given translation unit, a grammar has to beable to generate the complete translation unit, andnot just one of the corresponding word alignments.The last point has been argued for in S?gaard andKuhn (2009).SLCFRS are able to induce the alignment struc-tures under consideration (in Figure 1).
This is ex-emplified by the rules given in Figure 5.Clearly, there exist many different possible hier-archical alignments for a given alignment structure.The underlying constraints for the grammars in Fig-ure 5 are (a) each translation unit is represented by70(i)?A(a)?

A 1 (Y1, Y2)?Figure 5: SLCFRS rules that induce the alignments inFigure 1.
For (i) there are many other derivations possi-ble, since there are 4!
possibilities to combine the trans-lation units in a binary way.
The shown rules correspondto Figure 2(i).exactly one rule and (b) each rule aligns exactly onetranslation unit and combines it with at most one al-ready established synchronous constituent.ITG and NF-ITG do not generate the same classof alignments (S?gaard and Wu, 2009).
In paral-lel, a (2, v)-SLCFRS in normal form does not gen-erate the same class of alignments as an unrestricted(2, v)-SLCFRS.
Consider, for example, a discontin-uous translation unit d with two gaps on the sourceside and a grammar G with fan-out 32|1.
G in nor-mal form cannot induce d. In general, for generat-ing x gaps, a fan-out of x+ 1 is required.
However,without the normal form requirement, G can possi-bly induce d with a rule that combines the terminalsof d with the constituents that fill the gaps.2.4 Parsing ComplexityLCFRS in normal form can be parsed in O(n3k)where k is the fan-out of the grammar (Seki et al1991).
This result can be transferred to SLCFRS:An SLCFRS with fan-out v is essentially an LCFRSwith fan-out v + 1.

3Figure 6: All-accepting SCLFRS in normal form withfan-out v = ks + ktcannot change sides, no items that cross or involvethe additional gap have to be built during parsing.Bitext parsing with SLCFRS in normal form cantherefore also be performed in O(n3v) where n =max(ns, nt), or more specifically O(n3vGss n3vGtt )where ns, nt are the lengths of the source and tar-get input strings respectively.3 Empirical InvestigationSince parsing complexity with SLCFRS is deter-mined by the fan-out v of the grammar, we con-duct an investigation to find out which v would berequired to fully cover the alignment configurationsthat occur in manually aligned parallel corpora.3.1 Bottom-Up Hierarchical AlignerOur study is based on alignment validation(S?gaard, 2010), i.e.
we check whether an align-ment structure can be generated by an all-acceptingSLCFRS with a specific v. Such a grammar is de-picted in Figure 6.
Note in particular that it leavesopen how to compose the yield of the LHS non-terminal from the two RHS constituents.
To be ableto use the grammar for parsing, one would have tospell out all combination possibilities.Instead, we use the idea of a bottom-up hierar-chical aligner (Wellington et al 2006).
It worksvery much like a synchronous parser, but the con-straints for inferences are the word alignments andpotentially other things, and not the rewriting rulesof a grammar.
Initial constituents are built fromthe word alignments, then constituents are combinedwith each other.
The goal is to find a constituent thatcompletely covers the input.
In our case, the con-straints for the hierarchical aligner come from thetranslation units, the fan-out vks|kt of the simulatedgrammar and possibly a normal-form requirement.We specify the hierarchical aligner in terms ofa deduction system (Shieber et al 1995).
Deduc-71tion rules have the form A1...AmB C where A1 .
.
.
Amand B are items, i.e.
intermediate parsing results,and C is a list of conditions on A1 .
.
.
Am and B.The interpretation is that if A1 .
.
.
Am can be de-duced and conditions C hold, then B can be de-duced.
Our items have the form ?
[Xs,?s], [Xt,?t]?whereXs ?
Ns andXt ?
Nt of the simulated gram-mar.
All-accepting grammars usually have only onenon-terminal symbol, but we need a distinction be-tween pre-terminal constituents T and general con-stituents A for simulating SLCFRS in normal formas well as the full class.
?s and ?t characterize thespans of the synchronous constituent on the sourceand target side respectively.
We view them as bitvectors where ?s(i) = 1 means that si is in theyield of Xs, and ?t(i?)
= 1 that ti?
is in the yieldof Xt.
?s0...n, t0...n??
is the input sentence pairthat is segmented into m disjoint translation units?D(m)s , D(m)t ?
based on the given word alignmentstructure.
D(m)s and D(m)t are sets of word indicesinto s and t respectively.
We furthermore specifysome useful operations for bit vectors.
The ?
opera-tor combines bit vectors of the same length to a newbit vector by an elementwise or operation, while theintersection ?
of two bit vectors is the elementwiseand operation.
0l is a bit vector ?
such that ?
(i) = 0for all 0 ?

l. The function b(?)
returns thenumber of blocks of ?, i.e.
the number of continu-ous sequences of 1s in ?.Figure 7 shows the deduction rules of the hi-erarchical aligner that simulate an all-acceptingSLCFRS in normal form.
Scan builds T items fromtranslation units, Unary creates A items from Titems, and Binary combines two A items to a largerA item.
Via the side conditions, A items are onlycreated if they respect the specified fan-out vks|ktof the all-accepting grammar.
If the hierarchicalaligner finds an A item that spans ?s, t?, the align-ment structure of ?s, t?
is valid, i.e.
can be inducedby an SLCFRS in normal form with fan-out vks|kt .Since we are also interested in the empirical align-ment capacity of SLCFRS without normal-form re-striction, we present an extended deduction systemin Figure 8.
The additional rules lead to the simu-lation of an SLCFRS of rank 2 where terminals andvariables can be combined in the arguments of theLHS non-terminals of the rewriting rules.
Note inparticular that the generation of T items is not con-strained by a maximally allowed vks|kt .For the computation of the items, we use standardchart parsing techniques, maintaining a chart and anagenda.3.2 DataWe use manually aligned parallel corpora for ourstudy.2 Data sets that have already been previouslyused in similar experiments, e.g.
in Wellington etal.
(2006), S?gaard and Wu (2009), and S?gaard(2010), are those from Martin et al(2005) forEnglish-Romanian and English-Hindi, the English-French data from Mihalcea and Pedersen (2003), theEuroparl data set described in Grac?a et al(2008) forthe six combinations of English, French, Portugueseand Spanish, the English-German Europarl data thatwas created for Pado?
and Lapata (2006), and datasets with Danish as the source language that are partof the Parole corpus of the Copenhagen DependencyTreebank (Buch-Kromann et al 2009).We furthermore perform our study on data setsthat, to the best of our knowledge, have not beenevaluated in a similar setting before.
Those areEnglish-Swedish gold alignments documented inHolmqvist and Ahrenberg (2011), the English-Inuktitut data used in Martin et al(2005), moreEnglish-German data3, the English-Spanish data setin Lambert et al(2005) and English-Dutch align-ments that are part of the Dutch Parallel Corpus(Macken, 2010).
Characteristics about the data setsare presented in the last columns of Table 1.3.3 MethodWe apply the bottom-up hierarchical alignment al-gorithm in various configurations to each manuallyaligned sentence pair.
If a goal item is found, thealignment structure can be induced with the formal-ism in question.
We measure the number of sen-tence pairs for which a hierarchical alignment wasreached over the total number of sentence pairs.S?gaard (2010) refers to this as alignment reach-ability, which is the inverse of parse failure rate(Wellington et al 2006).2Whenever there are sure (S) and possible (P) alignmentsannotated, we use both.3By T.

It confirmes that NF-ITG is not capable of generating the majority ofalignment configurations.
However, when allow-ing discontinuous constituents with maximally twoblocks on each side (v = 42|2), NF-SLCFRS in-duces all alignments present in six of the data sets,and reaches scores > 97 for the other data sets, ex-cept two of them for which scores are still > 94.7.For grammars without normal-form constraint,alignment reachability is generally higher.
We testedgrammars of rank 2 and found that over 90% of thesentence pairs in each data set can be induced with-out the necessity of discontinuous constituents (ex-cept data set Schoen.).
Such grammars roughly cor-respond to successfully applied translation models,e.g.
in Hiero (Chiang, 2007).
Nevertheless, our ex-periments show that the gold alignments contain aproportion of structures that cannot be generated byITGs.
With a (2, 42|2)-SLCFRS, all occurring align-ment configurations are captured.
For some datasets, a fan-out of 3 is enough to induce all align-ments.
This is indicated by 1|2 and 2|1.Going back to grammars in normal form, the sen-tence pairs that cannot be induced with a grammarof fan-out 42|2 all display translation units that re-quire three (or very rarely four) blocks on at leastthe source or the target side.
An interesting observa-tion is that only the English-Inuktitut data can nev-ertheless be generated with fan-out 4, by distribut-ing the allowed discontinuity unequally: with a NF-SLCFRS with fan-out 43|1, the alignment reachabil-ity is 100.
This is not surprising given the fact thatInuktitut is a polysynthetic language.Previous results by S?gaard (2010) concerningthe coverage of ITG and NF-ITG on hand-aligneddata, repeated for convenience in Table 1, are muchlower than ours and therefore present a highly dis-torted picture concerning the empirical need of dis-continuous constituents.
This is due to the fact thatthe implementation4 used for the experiments han-dles unaligned words incorrectly.
They are addeddeterministically to the first constituent that encoun-ters them, which leads to false negatives as furtherexplained in Figure 9.
After fixing this issue, thesame results as for NF-SLCFRS with v = 21|1 are4http://cst.dk/anders/itg-search.html[ ] 6[ ] 5[ ] 4[ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3a b c da?

Whentrying to combine 4 and 3 , c and c?

The algorithm cannotfind a larger continuous constituent, the alignment valida-tion therefore returns false.
However, this simple align-ment structure lies within the power of NF-ITG and ITG.obtained.
Another problem of the implementationconcerns discontinuous translation units.
S?gaard?salignment validation returns false if the words in thegap are aligned, although such configurations areinduced by unrestricted ITG, see S?gaard and Wu(2009, Section 3.2.1).4 DiscussionOur experiments show that by moving from syn-chronous grammars with only continuous con-stituents to grammars that allow two blocks perconstituent, (almost) all manual alignments can begenerated, depending on whether the normal-formis enforced or not.
Given the parsing complexitythat comes with allowing discontinuities, this is apromising finding since it has already been shownfor monolingual parsing that restricting the fan-outto 2 drastically reduces parsing times (Maier et al2012).
In the future, we might also investigatewhether refraining from ill-nested structures (Maierand Lichte, 2011) is a reasonable option for tree-based machine translation in order to reduce com-plexity (Go?mez-Rodr?
?guez et al 2010).Even though bitext parsing complexity forSLCFRS is prohibitively high, we expect that, giventhe techniques that have been developed for transla-tion with SCFG, SLCFRS finds its application as a74translation model.
In practice, only source side pars-ing is performed for translation and various prun-ing methods are applied to reduce the search space(e.g.
in Chiang (2005), Yamada and Knight (2002)and many others).It should also be mentioned that it is not clear yethow alignment reachability scores relate to machinetranslation quality and evaluation.
We can never-theless infer from the presented results that what isconsidered as translationally equivalent by the anno-tators of the data sets and their guidelines is beyondthe search space of SCFG.
A supplementary studycould furthermore investigate translation unit errorrates (S?gaard and Kuhn, 2009) for the data sets, un-der the assumption of a hierarchical SLCFRS align-ment with a specific fan-out.5 Related WorkOur empirical investigation extends previous stud-ies, and thus provides new insights.
Both Welling-ton et al(2006) and S?gaard (2010) use a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm with the goal ofinvestigating the alignment complexity of manuallyaligned parallel corpora.
S?gaard (2010) is howeveronly interested in the alignment reachability of ITGand NF-ITG, and nothing beyond.
We have further-more revealed that the presented results underesti-mate the alignment capacity of ITG and NF-ITG.The study of Wellington et al(2006) is very sim-ilar to ours in that the number of blocks in discon-tinuous constituents that are required for hierarchi-cal alignment are investigated.
The word alignmentsare however treated disjunctively, which means thatin the case of n-to-m alignments with n,m ?
1,it is enough to induce one of the involved align-ments.
With this methodology a large class of dis-continuities we are interested in, e.g.
cross-serialdiscontinuous translation units, is ignored.
The fail-ure rates they present are therefore much lower thanours.
Wellington et al(2006) also show that whenconstraining synchronous derivations by monolin-gual syntactic parse trees on the source and/or targetside, allowing discontinuous constituents becomeseven more important for inducing gold alignments.We are of course not the first to propose a trans-lation model that is expressive enough to inducethe alignments in question in Figure 1.
Followingup on a translation model proposed by Simard etal.
(2005), Galley and Manning (2010) extend thephrase-based approach in that they allow for discon-tinuous phrase pairs.
Their system outperforms aphrase-based system and a system based on SCFGof rank 2.
In a way, our proposal to use SLCFRSis the syntax-based counterpart to their approach.Methods to integrate linguistic constituency infor-mation into the so far only formal tree-based ap-proach can be directly transferred from the SCFG-based approaches to SLCFRS.
In constrast, it is notobvious how to include such information into thephrase-based systems.S?gaard (2008) proposes to use an even more ex-pressive formalism than LCFRS, namely range con-catenation grammar, and to exploit its ability to copysubstrings during the derivation.
The downsides ofthis approach are already mentioned in S?gaard andKuhn (2009); for example, no tight probability esti-mation is possible for such a grammar.The necessity of going towards mildly context-sensitive formalisms for translation modeling hasalso been advocated by Melamed (Melamed et al2004; Melamed, 2004).
This step was howevernot motivated by the induction of specific complextranslation units, but rather by the general obser-vation that discontinuous constituents are necessaryfor synchronous derivations using linguistically mo-tivated grammars.
Discontinuous constituents alsoemerge when binarizing synchronous grammars ofcontinuous yields with rank ?
4 (Melamed, 2003;Rambow and Satta, 1999).6 ConclusionMotivated by the finding that synchronous CFG can-not induce certain alignment configurations, we sug-gest to use synchronous LCFRS instead, which al-lows for discontinuities.
Even though our empiricalinvestigation shows that with exclusively continuousderivations more manual alignments can be capturedthan previously reported, there are still many alignedsentence pairs that can only be generated when set-ting the fan-out of the translation grammar to > 2.It remains to determine how such more accurate andmore expressive models relate to translation quality.75AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Laura Kallmeyer and WolfgangMaier for discussions and comments, the reviewersfor their suggestions, Anders S?gaard for discus-sions concerning ITG and his implementation, andZdene?k Z?abokrtsky?
