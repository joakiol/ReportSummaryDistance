The developed @AM sys-tem relies on the compositionality prin-ciple and a novel approach based on therules elaborated for semantically distinctverb classes.
The evaluation of our me-thod on 1000 sentences, that describepersonal experiences, showed promisingresults: average accuracy on the fine-grained level (14 labels) was 62%, on themiddle level (7 labels) ?
71%, and on thetop level (3 labels) ?
88%.1 Introduction and Related WorkWith rapidly growing online sources aimed atencouraging and stimulating people?s discussionsconcerning personal, public or social issues(news, blogs, discussion forums, etc.
), there is agreat need in development of a computationaltool for the analysis of people?s attitudes.
Ac-cording to the Appraisal Theory (Martin andWhite, 2005), attitude types define the specificsof appraisal being expressed: affect (personalemotional state), judgment (social or ethical ap-praisal of other?s behaviour), and appreciation(evaluation of phenomena).To analyse contextual sentiment of a phrase ora sentence, rule-based approaches (Nasukawaand Yi, 2003; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Sub-rahmanian and Reforgiato, 2008), a machine-learning method using not only lexical but alsosyntactic features (Wilson et al, 2005), and amodel of integration of machine learning ap-proach with compositional semantics (Choi andCardie, 2008) were proposed.
With the aim torecognize fine-grained emotions from text on thelevel of distinct sentences, researchers have em-ployed a keyword spotting technique (Chuangand Wu, 2004; Strapparava et al, 2007), a tech-nique calculating emotion scores using PointwiseMutual Information (PMI) (Kozareva et al,2007), an approach inspired by common-senseknowledge (Liu et al, 2003), rule-based linguis-tic approaches (Boucouvalas, 2003; Chaumartin,2007), machine-learning methods (Alm, 2008;Aman and Szpakowicz, 2008; Strapparava andMihalcea, 2008), and an ensemble based multi-label classification technique (Bhowmick et al,2009).Early attempts to focus on distinct attitudetypes in the task of attitude analysis were madeby Taboada and Grieve (2004), who determineda potential value of adjectives for affect, judge-ment and appreciation by calculating the PMIwith the pronoun-copular pairs ?I was (affect)?,?He was (judgement)?, and ?It was (apprecia-tion)?, and Whitelaw et al (2005), who used amachine learning technique (SVM) with fine-grained semantic distinctions in features (attitudetype, orientation) in combination with ?bag ofwords?
to classify movie reviews.
However, theconcentration only on adjectives expressing ap-praisal and their modifiers greatly narrows thepotential of the Whitelaw et al (2005) approach.In this paper we introduce our system @AM(ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifiessentences according to the fine-grained attitudelabels (nine affect categories (Izard, 1971): ?an-ger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?,?sadness?, ?shame?, ?surprise?
; four polarity la-bels for judgment and appreciation: ?POS jud?,?NEG jud?, ?POS app?, ?NEG app?
; and ?neu-tral?
); (2) assigns the strength of the attitude; and(3) determines the level of confidence, withwhich the attitude is expressed.
@AM relies on acompositionality principle and a novel approach806based on the rules elaborated for semanticallydistinct verb classes.2 Lexicon for Attitide AnalysisWe built a lexicon for attitude analysis that in-cludes: (1) attitude-conveying terms; (2) modifi-ers; (3) ?functional?
words; and (4) modal opera-tors.2.1 The Core of LexiconAs a core of lexicon for attitude analysis, we em-ploy an Affect database and extended version ofthe SentiFul database developed by Neviar-ouskaya et al (2009).
The affective features ofeach emotion-related word are encoded usingnine emotion labels (?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?,?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?, ?sadness?, ?shame?, and?surprise?)
and corresponding emotion intensitiesthat range from 0.0 to 1.0.
The original versionof SentiFul database, which contains sentiment-conveying adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbsannotated by sentiment polarity, polarity scoresand weights, was manually extended using atti-tude labels.
Some examples of annotated atti-tude-conveying words are listed in Table 1.
It isimportant to note here that some words may ex-press different attitude types (affect, judgment,appreciation) depending on context; such lexicalentries were annotated by all possible categories.POS Word Category Intensityadjective honorableunfriendlyPOS judNEG aff (sadness)NEG judNEG app0.30.50.50.5adverb gleefully POS aff (joy) 0.9noun abnormality NEG app 0.25verb frightendesireNEG aff (fear)POS aff (interest)POS aff (joy)0.81.00.5Table 1.
Examples of attitude-conveying wordsand their annotations.2.2 Modifiers and Functional WordsWe collected 138 modifiers that have an impacton contextual attitude features of related words,phrases, or clauses.
They include:1.
Adverbs of degree (e.g., ?significantly?,?slightly?
etc.)
and affirmation (e.g., ?absolutely?,?seemingly?)
that have an influence on thestrength of the attitude of related words.
Twoannotators gave coefficients for intensity degreestrengthening or weakening (from 0.0 to 2.0) toeach adverb, and the result was averaged (e.g.,coeff(?slightly?)
= 0.2).2.
Negation words (e.g., ?never?, ?nothing?etc.)
reversing the polarity of related statement.3.
Adverbs of doubt (e.g., ?scarcely?,?hardly?
etc.)
and falseness (e.g., ?wrongly?
etc.
)reversing the polarity of related statement.4.
Prepositions (e.g., ?without?, ?despite?
etc.
)neutralizing the attitude of related words.5.
Condition operators (e.g., ?if?, ?eventhough?
etc.)
that neutralize the attitude of relatedwords.We distinguish two types of ?functional?
wordsthat influence contextual attitude and its strength:1.
Intensifying adjectives (e.g., ?rising?, ?rap-idly-growing?
), nouns (e.g., ?increase?
), andverbs (e.g., ?to grow?, ?to rocket?)
that increasethe strength of attitude of related words.2.
Reversing adjectives (e.g., ?reduced?
),nouns (e.g., ?termination), and verbs (e.g., ?todecrease?, ?to limit?, ?to diminish?
), which re-verse the prior polarity of related words.2.3 Modal OperatorsConsideration of the modal operators in the tasksof opinion mining and attitude analysis is veryimportant, as they indicate a degree of person?sbelief in the truth of the proposition, which issubjective in nature (Hoye, 1997).
Modals aredistinguished by their confidence level.
We col-lected modal operators of two categories: modalverbs (13 verbs) and modal adverbs (61 adverbs).Three human annotators assigned the confidencelevel ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 to each modal verband adverb; these ratings were averaged (e.g.,conf(?vaguely?)
= 0.17, conf(?arguably?)
= 0.63,conf(?would?)
= 0.8, conf(?veritably?)
= 1.0).3 Compositionality PrincipleOur algorithm for attitude classification is de-signed based on the compositionality principle,according to which we determine the attitudinalmeaning of a sentence by composing the piecesthat correspond to lexical units or other linguisticconstituent types governed by the rules of polari-ty reversal, aggregation (fusion), propagation,domination, neutralization, and intensification, atvarious grammatical levels.Polarity reversal means that a phrase orstatement containing an attitude-conveying807term/phrase with prior positive polarity becomesnegative, and vice versa.
The rule of polarity re-versal is applied in three cases: (1) negationword-modifier in relation with an attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?never?
&POS(?succeed?)
=> NEG(?never succeed?
)); (2)adverb of doubt in relation with attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?scarcely?
&POS(?relax?)
=> NEG(?scarcely relax?
)); (3)functional word of reversing type in relation withattitude-conveying statement (e.g., adjective ?re-duced?
& POS(?enthusiasm?)
=> NEG(?reducedenthusiasm?)).
In the case of judgment and ap-preciation, the use of the polarity reversal rule isstraightforward (?POS jud?
<=> ?NEG jud?,?POS app?
<=> ?NEG app?).
However, it is nottrivial to find pairs of opposite emotions in thecase of a fine-grained classification, except for?joy?
and ?sadness?.
Therefore, we assume that(1) the opposite emotion for three positive emo-tions, i.e.
?interest?, ?joy?, and ?surprise?, is ?sad-ness?
(?POS aff?
=> ?sadness?
); and (2) the oppo-site emotion for six negative emotions, i.e.
?an-ger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?sadness?, and?shame?, is ?joy?
(?NEG aff?
=> ?joy?
).The rules of aggregation (fusion) are as fol-lows: (1) if polarities of attitude-conveying termsin adjective-noun, noun-noun, adverb-adjective,adverb-verb phrases have opposite directions,mixed polarity with dominant polarity of a pre-modifier is assigned to the phrase (e.g.,POS(?beautiful?)
& NEG(?fight?)
=> POS-neg(?beautiful fight?
); NEG(?shamelessly?)
&POS(?celebrate?)
=> NEG-pos(?shamelesslycelebrate?
)); otherwise (2) the resulting polarityis based on the equal polarities of terms, and thestrength of attitude is measured as a maximumbetween polarity scores (intensities) of terms(max(score1,score2)).The rule of propagation is useful, as proposedin (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), for the task of thedetection of local sentiments for given subjects.?Propagation?
verbs propagate the sentiment to-wards the arguments; ?transfer?
verbs transmitsentiments among the arguments.
The rule ofpropagation is applied when a verb of ?propaga-tion?
or ?transfer?
type is used in a phrase/clauseand sentiment of an argument that has prior neu-tral polarity needs to be investigated (e.g.,PROP-POS(?to admire?)
& ?his behaviour?
=>POS(?his behaviour?
); ?Mr.
X?
&TRANS(?supports?)
& NEG(?crime business?
)=> NEG(?Mr.
X?
)).The rules of domination are as follows: (1) ifpolarities of a verb (this rule is applied only forcertain classes of verbs) and an object in a clausehave opposite directions, the polarity of verb isprevailing (e.g., NEG(?to deceive?)
&POS(?hopes?)
=> NEG(?to deceive hopes?
)); (2)if compound sentence joints clauses using coor-dinate connector ?but?, the attitude features of aclause following after the connector are domi-nant (e.g., ?NEG(It was hard to climb a mountainall night long), but POS(a magnificent view re-warded the traveler at the morning).?
=>POS(whole sentence)).The rule of neutralization is applied whenpreposition-modifier or condition operator relateto the attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?de-spite?
& NEG(?worries?)
=> NEUT(?despiteworries?
)).The rule of intensification means strengthen-ing or weakening of the polarity score (intensity),and is applied when:1. adverb of degree or affirmation relates toattitude-conveying term (e.g.,Pos_score(?happy?)
< Pos_score(?extremely hap-py?));2.
adjective or adverb is used in a compara-tive or superlative form (e.g., Neg_score(?sad?)
<Neg_score(?sadder?)
< Neg_score (?saddest?
)).Our method is capable of processing sentences ofdifferent complexity, including simple, com-pound, complex (with complement and relativeclauses), and complex-compound sentences.
Weemploy Connexor Machinese Syntax parser(http://www.connexor.eu/) that returnslemmas, parts of speech, dependency functions,syntactic function tags, and morphological tags.When handling the parser output, we representthe sentence as a set of primitive clauses.
Eachclause might include Subject formation, Verbformation and Object formation, each of whichmay consist of a main element (subject, verb, orobject) and its attributives and complements.
Forthe processing of complex or compound sen-tences, we build a so-called ?relation matrix?,which contains information about dependences(e.g., coordination, subordination, condition,contingency, etc.)
between different clauses in asentence.
While applying the compositionalityprinciple, we consecutively assign attitude fea-808tures to words, phrases, formations, clauses, andfinally, to the whole sentence.4 Consideration of the Semantics ofVerbsAll sentences must include a verb, because theverb tells us what action the subject is perform-ing and object is receiving.
In order to elaboraterules for attitude analysis based on the semanticsof verbs, we investigated VerbNet (Kipper et al,2007), the largest on-line verb lexicon that is or-ganized into verb classes characterized by syn-tactic and semantic coherence among membersof a class.
Based on the thorough analysis of 270first-level classes of VerbNet and their members,73 verb classes (1) were found useful for the taskof attitude analysis, and (2) were further classi-fied into 22 classes differentiated by the role thatmembers play in attitude analysis and by rulesapplied to them.
Our classification is shown inTable 2.For each of our verb classes, we developed setof rules that are applied to attitude analysis onthe phrase/clause-level.
Some verb classes (e.g.,?Psychological state or emotional reaction?,?Judgment?, ?Bodily state and damage to thebody?, ?Preservation?
etc.)
include verbs anno-tated by attitude type, prior polarity orientation,and the strength of attitude.
The attitude featuresof phrases that involve positively or negativelycharged verbs from such classes are context-sensitive and are defined by means of rules de-signed for each of the class.As an example, we provide short descriptionand rules elaborated for the subclass ?Object-centered (oriented) emotional state?.Features: subject experiences emotions towardssome stimulus; verb prior polarity: positive ornegative; context-sensitive.Verb-Object rules (subject is ignored):1.

In case of neutral object => attitude type andprior polarity of verb, verb score (V_score).Verb-PP (prepositional phrase) rules:1.
In case of negatively charged verb and PPstarting with ?from?
=> verb dominance:S & V-(?suffers?)
& PP-(?from illness?)
=> in-terior: ?NEG aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.S & V-(?suffers?)
& PP+ (?from love?)
=> inte-rior: ?NEG aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.2.
In case of positively charged verb and PPstarting with ?in?/?for?
=> treat PP the same wayas object (see above):S & V+(?believes?)
& PP-(?in evil?)
=> inte-rior: ?POS aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.S & V+(?believes?)
& PP+(?in kindness?)
=>interior: ?POS aff?
; exterior: ?POS jud?.In the majority of rules the strength of attitude ismeasured as a maximum between attitude scores(for example, the attitude conveyed by ?to sufferfrom grave illness?
is stronger than that of ?tosuffer from slight illness?
).In contrast to the rules of ?Object-centered(oriented) emotional state?
subclass, which ig-nore attitude features of a subject in a sentence,the rules elaborated for the ?Subject-drivenchange in emotional state (trans.)?
disregard theattitude features of object, as in sentences involv-ing members of this subclass object experiencesemotion, and subject causes the emotional state.For example (due to limitation of space, here andbelow we provide only some cases):S(?Classical music?)
& V+(?calmed?)
& O-(?disobedient child?)
=> interior: ?POS aff?
; exte-rior: ?POS app?.S-(?Fatal consequences of GM food intake?)
&V-(?frighten?)
& O(?me?)
=> interior: ?NEG aff?
;exterior: ?NEG app?.The Verb-Object rules for the ?Judgment?
sub-classes, namely ?Positive judgment?
and ?Nega-tive judgment?, are very close to those definedfor the subclass ?Object-centered (oriented)emotional state?.
However, Verb-PP rules havesome specifics: for both positive and negativejudgment verbs, we treat PP starting with?for?/?of?/?as?
the same way as object in Verb-Object rules.
For example:S(?He?)
& V-(?blamed?)
& O+(?innocent per-son?)
=> interior: ?NEG jud?
; exterior: ?NEGjud?.S(?They?)
& V-(?punished?)
& O(?him?)
& PP-(?for his misdeed?)
=> interior: ?NEG jud?
; exte-rior: ?POS jud?.Verbs from classes ?Favorable attitude?
and?Adverse (unfavorable) attitude?
have prior neu-tral polarity and positive or negative reinforce-ment, correspondingly, that means that they onlyimpact on the polarity and strength of non-neutral phrase (object in a sentence written inactive voice, or subject in a sentence written inpassive voice, or PP in case of some verbs).
Therules are:1.
If verb belongs to the ?Favorable attitude?class and the polarity of phrase is not neutral,then the attitude score of the phrase is intensified(symbol ?^?
means intensification):S(?They?)
& [V pos.
reinforcement](?elected?
)& O+(?fair judge?)
=> ?POS app?
; O_score^.S(?They?)
& [V pos.
reinforcement](?elected?
)& O-(?corrupt candidate?)
=> ?NEG app?;O_score^.2.
If verb belongs to the ?Adverse (unfavorable)attitude?
class and the polarity of phrase is notneutral, then the polarity of phrase is reversedand score is intensified:S(?They?)
& [V neg.
reinforce-ment](?prevented?)
& O-(?the spread of disease?
)=> ?POS app?
; O_score^.S+(?His achievements?)
& [V neg.

=> ?NEG app?
;S_score^.Below are examples of processing the sentenceswith verbs from ?Verbs of removing?
class.
?Verbs of removing with neutral charge?
:S(?The tape-recorder?)
& [V neutralrem.
](?automatically ejects?)
& O-neutral(?thetape?)
=> neutral.S(?The safety invention?)
& [V neutralrem.](?ejected?)
& O(?the pilot?)
& PP-(?fromburning plane?)
=> ?POS app?
; PP_score^.
?Verbs of removing with negative charge?:S(?Manager?)
& [V neg.

& O-(?careless employee?)
& PP(?from the company?
)=> ?POS app?
; max(V_score,O_score).
?Verbs of removing with positive charge?:S(?They?)
& [V pos.

&O(?children?)
& PP-(?from dangerous place?)
=>?POS app?
; max(V_score,PP_score).Along with modal verbs and modal adverbs,members of the ?Communication indica-tor/reinforcement of attitude?
verb class also in-810dicate the confidence level or degree of certaintyconcerning given opinion.
Features are: subject(communicator) expresses statementwith/without attitude; statement is PP startingwith ?of?, ?on?, ?against?, ?about?, ?concerning?,?regarding?, ?that?, ?how?
etc.
; ground: positiveor negative; reinforcement: positive or negative.The rules are:1.
If the polarity of expressed statement is neu-tral, then the attitude is neutral:S(?Professor?)
& [V pos.
ground, pos.
rein-forcement, confidence:0.83](?dwelled?)
& PP-neutral(?on a question?)
=> neutral.2.
If the polarity of expressed statement is notneutral and the reinforcement is positive, then thescore of the statement (PP) is intensified:S(?Jane?)
& [V neg.
ground, pos.
reinforce-ment, confidence:0.8](?is complaining?)
& PP-(?of a headache again?)
=> ?NEG app?
;PP_score^; confidence:0.8.3.
If the polarity of expressed statement is notneutral and reinforcement is negative, then thepolarity of the statement (PP) is reversed andscore is intensified:S(?Max?)
& [V neg.
ground, neg.
reinforce-ment, confidence:0.2](?doubt?)
& PP-{?that?S+(?his good fortune?)
& [V termination](?willever end?)}
=> ?POS app?
; PP_score^; confi-dence:0.2.In the last example, to measure the sentiment ofPP, we apply rule for the verb ?end?
from the?Termination of activity?
class, which reversesthe non-neutral polarity of subject (in intransitiveuse of verb) or object (in transitive use of verb).For example, the polarity of both sentences ?Mywhole enthusiasm and excitement disappear likea bubble touching a hot needle?
and ?They dis-continued helping children?
is negative.5 Decision on Attitude LabelThe decision on the most appropriate final labelfor the clause, in case @AM annotates it usingdifferent attitude types according to the wordswith multiple annotations (e.g., see word ?un-friendly?
in Table 1) or based on the availabilityof the words conveying different attitude types,is made based on the analysis of:1) morphological tags of nominal heads andtheir premodifiers in the clause (e.g., first personpronoun, third person pronoun, demonstrativepronoun, nominative or genitive noun, etc.
);2) the sequence of hypernymic semantic re-lations of a particular noun in WordNet (Miller,1990), which allows to determine its conceptualdomain (e.g., ?person, human being?, ?artifact?,?event?, etc.
);3) the annotations from the StanfordNamed Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al 2005)that labels PERSON, ORGANIZATION, andLOCATION entities.For ex., ?I feel highly unfriendly attitude towardsme?
conveys emotion (?NEG aff?
: ?sadness?
),while ?The shop assistant?s behavior was reallyunfriendly?
and ?Plastic bags are environmentunfriendly?
express judgment (?NEG jud?)
andappreciation (?NEG app?
), correspondingly.6 EvaluationFor the experiments, we used our own data set,as, to the best of our knowledge, there is no pub-licly available data set of sentences annotated bythe fine-grained labels proposed in our work.
Inorder to evaluate the performance of our algo-rithm, we created the data set of sentences ex-tracted from personal stories about life expe-riences that were anonymously published on theExperience Project website(www.experienceproject.com), wherepeople share personal experiences, thoughts,opinions, feelings, passions, and confessionsthrough the network of personal stories.
Withover 4 million experiences accumulated (as ofFebruary 2010), Experience Project is a perfectsource for researchers interested in studying dif-ferent types of attitude expressed through text.6.1 Data Set DescriptionFor our experiment we extracted 1000 sentences1from various stories grouped by topics within 13different categories, such as ?Arts and entertain-ment?, ?Current events?, ?Education?, ?Familyand friends?, ?Health and wellness?, ?Relation-ships and romance?
and others, on the Expe-rience Project website.
Sentences were collectedfrom 358 distinct topic groups, such as ?I stillremember September 11?, ?I am intelligent butairheaded?, ?I think bullfighting is cruel?, ?I quitsmoking?, ?I am a fashion victim?, ?I wasadopted?
and others.1 This annotated data set is freely available upon request.811We considered three hierarchical levels of atti-tude labels in our experiment (see Figure 1).Three independent annotators labeled the sen-tences with one of 14 categories from the ALLlevel and a corresponding score (the strength orintensity value).
These annotations were furtherinterpreted using labels from the MID and theTOP levels.
Fleiss?
Kappa coefficient was usedas a measure of reliability of human raters?
anno-tations.
The agreement coefficient on 1000 sen-tences was 0.53 on ALL level, 0.57 on MID level,and 0.73 on TOP level.Only those sentences, on which at least twoout of three human raters completely agreed,were included in the gold standards for our expe-riment.
Three gold standards were created ac-cording to the hierarchy of attitude labels.
Fleiss?Kappa coefficients are 0.62, 0.63, and 0.74 onALL, MID, and TOP levels, correspondingly.Table 3 shows the distributions of labels in thegold standards.ALL level MID levelLabel Number Label Numberanger 45 POS aff 233disgust 21 NEG aff 332fear 54 POS jud 66guilt 22 NEG jud 78interest 84 POS app 100joy 95 NEG app 29sadness 133 neutral 87shame 18 total 925surprise 36POS jud 66 TOP levelNEG jud 78 Label NumberPOS app 100 POS 437NEG app 29 NEG 473neutral 87 neutral 87total 868 total 997Table 3.
Label distributions in gold standards.6.2 ResultsThe results of a simple method selecting the atti-tude label with the maximum intensity from theannotations of sentence tokens found in the data-base were considered as the baseline.
Afterprocessing each sentence from the data set by thebaseline method and our @AM system, wemeasured averaged accuracy, precision, recall,and F-score for each label in ALL, MID, andTOP levels.
The results are shown in Table 4.As seen from the obtained results, our algo-rithm performed with high accuracy significantlysurpassing the baselines in all levels of attitudehierarchy, thus demonstrating the contribution ofthe sentence parsing and our hand-crafted rulesto the reliable recognition of attitude from text.Two-tailed t-tests with significance level of 0.05showed that the differences in accuracy betweenthe baseline method and our @AM system arestatistically significant (p<0.001) in fine-grainedas well as coarse-grained classifications.In the case of fine-grained attitude recognition(ALL level), the highest precision was obtainedfor ?shame?
(0.923) and ?NEG jud?
(0.889),while the highest recall was received for ?sad-ness?
(0.917) and ?joy?
(0.905) emotions at thecost of low precision (0.528 and 0.439, corre-spondingly).
The algorithm performed with theworst results in recognition of ?NEG app?
and?neutral?.The analysis of a confusion matrix for theALL level revealed the following top confusionsof our system: (1) ?anger?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?shame?,?NEG jud?, ?NEG app?
and ?neutral?
were pre-dominantly incorrectly predicted as ?sadness?
(for ex., @AM resulted in ?sadness?
for the sen-tence ?I know we have several months left beforethe election, but I am already sick and tired ofseeing the ads on TV?, while human annotationswere ?anger?/?anger?/?disgust?
); (2) ?interest?,?POS jud?
and ?POS app?
were mostly confusedwith ?joy?
by our algorithm (e.g., @AM classi-fied the sentence ?It?s one of those life changingartifacts that we must have in order to have hap-pier, healthier lives?
as ?joy?
(-ful), while humanannotations were ?POS app?/?POSapp?/?interest?
).Our system achieved high precision for allcategories on the MID level (Table 4), with theexception of ?NEG app?
and ?neutral?, althoughTOP POS NEG neutralMID POS aff POS judPOSapp NEG affNEGjudNEGapp neutralALL interest joy surprise POS judPOSapp anger disgust fear guilt sadness shameNEGjudNEGapp neutralFigure 1.
Hierarchy of attitude labels.812high recall was obtained only in the case of cate-gories related to affect (?POS aff?, ?NEG aff?
).These results indicate that affect sensing is easierthan recognition of judgment or appreciationfrom text.
TOP level results (Table 4) show thatour algorithm classifies sentences that conveypositive or negative sentiment with high accura-cy (92% and 91%, correspondingly).
On the oth-er hand, ?neutral?
sentences still pose a challenge.The analysis of errors revealed that system re-quires common sense or additional context todeal with sentences like ?All through my life I?vefelt like I?m second fiddle?
(gold standard: ?sad-ness?
; @AM: ?neutral?)
or ?For me every minuteon my horse is alike an hour in heaven!?
(goldstandard: ?joy?
; @AM: ?neutral?
).We also evaluated the system performancewith regard to attitude intensity estimation.
Thepercentage of attitude-conveying sentences (notconsidering neutral ones), on which the result ofour system conformed to the fine-grained goldstandard (ALL level), according to the measureddistance between intensities given by human ra-ters (averaged values) and those obtained by oursystem is shown in Table 5.
As seen from thetable, our system achieved satisfactory results inestimation of the strength of attitude expressedthrough text.Range of intensitydifferencePercent of sen-tences, %[0.0 ?

Results on intensity.7 ConclusionsIn this paper we introduced @AM, which is sofar, to the best of our knowledge, the only systemclassifying sentences using fine-grained attitudetypes, and extensively dealing with the semanticsof verbs in attitude analysis.
Our compositionapproach broadens the coverage of sentenceswith complex contextual attitude.
The evaluationresults indicate that @AM achieved reliable re-sults in the task of textual attitude analysis.
Thelimitations include dependency on lexicon andon accuracy of the parser.
The primary objectivefor the future research is to develop a method forthe extraction of reasons behind the expressedattitude.Level Label Baseline method @AM Accuracy Precision Recall F-score Accuracy Precision Recall F-scoreALLanger0.4370.742 0.511 0.6050.6210.818 0.600 0.692disgust 0.600 0.857 0.706 0.818 0.857 0.837fear 0.727 0.741 0.734 0.768 0.796 0.782guilt 0.667 0.364 0.471 0.833 0.455 0.588interest 0.380 0.357 0.368 0.772 0.524 0.624joy 0.266 0.579 0.364 0.439 0.905 0.591sadness 0.454 0.632 0.528 0.528 0.917 0.670shame 0.818 0.500 0.621 0.923 0.667 0.774surprise 0.625 0.694 0.658 0.750 0.833 0.789POS jud 0.429 0.227 0.297 0.824 0.424 0.560NEG jud 0.524 0.141 0.222 0.889 0.410 0.561POS app 0.349 0.150 0.210 0.755 0.400 0.523NEG app 0.250 0.138 0.178 0.529 0.310 0.391neutral 0.408 0.483 0.442 0.559 0.437 0.490MIDPOS aff0.5240.464 0.695 0.5570.7090.668 0.888 0.762NEG aff 0.692 0.711 0.701 0.765 0.910 0.831POS jud 0.405 0.227 0.291 0.800 0.424 0.554NEG jud 0.458 0.141 0.216 0.842 0.410 0.552POS app 0.333 0.150 0.207 0.741 0.400 0.519NEG app 0.222 0.138 0.170 0.474 0.310 0.375neutral 0.378 0.483 0.424 0.514 0.437 0.472TOPPOS0.7320.745 0.796 0.7700.8790.918 0.920 0.919NEG 0.831 0.719 0.771 0.912 0.922 0.917neutral 0.347 0.483 0.404 0.469 0.437 0.452Table 4.
